{"text":"Nini's Meatball House has quickly become one of my favourite spots in Montreal. Nestled in the hip Little Burgundy/St Henri area, it fits in perfectly! Although a small spot, it is not to be dismissed!

Their menu offers a variety of vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options. They have taken a spin on traditional meatballs creating such as Spinach Pesto meatballs, beefs meatballs filled with bacon and cheddar, and my favourite seabass with lemon and Tartar sauce. They also have a selection of side dishes such as Asian style salmon tartar quinoa salad and so forth. A cocktail list Is also available, as well as wine options and speedrail spirits.

What's super awesome, even more awesome, about thus hidden gem is their 5$ lunch menu! Everything is 5$, even a glass of wine!!!! If that's not a good enough excuse to go, you are depriving yourself! Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"We went here because another restaurant was closed. It's a nice concept. Mainly meatballs. They have good side dishes and a romantic atmosphere. The meatballs are decent and decently priced. Their salads are delicious. I had the side of roasted, they were tasty but we're mostly carrots and the beef meatballs with Marinara sauce. I enjoyed them, they were a
Little spicy just the way I liked them."}
{"text":"Bad service experience, felt very rushed, drinks were taken away before we finished them...food arrived cold...it's nothing but a fire pit for your money!! Our nice waiter was NOT to blame, it was the other staff/owners who were very hyper-rushed.  It's a No No!  They are just cashing in on the Griffintown hype."}
{"text":"We walked in not knowing what to except, yet having high expectations based on reviews and photos I have seen. Luckily, their reviews and photos were as outstanding as our entire evening and meal at Nini's. 
Beginning with their service, our waitress was very professional, kind and, friendly. Informed as of everything we wanted to know. 
The food variety is good as well as original. Many choices of meatballs and side dishes at a reasonable price.
Once we ordered our meal, it arrived well presented and warm within 10-15minutes. 
Our carrot soup was very hot, as a soup should be, yet it lacked ginger and a bit of flavour. Yet, still tasty and smooth. 
Our meatballs, were perfectly tender and very flavourful. We ordered the classic meatballs with tomato sauce, and meatballs with chimichurri. Both were outstanding! I highly recommend the chimichurri. It had a good kick of heat and zing. 
Our meal was finished by their house made ice cream sandwiches. You pick a cookie along with an ice cream flavour. These were prepared to perfection! The cookies were tender and the ice cream was delicious! A good creamy rich not fluffy type of ice cream. 
Because the taste of background music and a lovely ambience was perfect, we decided to stay and enjoy the place.
From their staff to the manage being very kind, this is truly a fantastic little place! A must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, service rapide et les boulettes sont excellentes !!! Je le recommande fortement."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by the food at Nini Meatball.
We were well greeted at the restaurant even thought there was a private christmas party. It was very crowded but had very good service

The waiter suggested that we share 3 different type of meatball per 2. 
We also ordered sides and salmon tartare.

verdict: salmon tartare was good
the meat balls were OK, 3 orders per 2 was too much, I'd stick to one per person.
My Favourite was the sweet potato ball.
But I wasn't impressed.

for dessert i had the crumble, it wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Finally got to taste it as the 2 previous times it was closed eventhough website said it was opened. Portions are good size and delicious. Lemonade was really good. The sugar pie desert was great, not too sugary and excellent tase."}
{"text":"I've come to this place twice now and I love the ambiance of the restaurant. During the day, the white decor and lighting of the place makes it feel magical and special. In the evening the candlelight and hushed conversation make it feel cozy and warm. I love this place for special occasions and when friends from out of town visit. 

The meatballs are so good. They have amazing flavour. They also have a DIY flavour ice cream sandwich dessert which is so much fun and tastes so good!"}
{"text":"Great food with a cozy ambiance. Prices were very reasonable and the wine selection was great."}
{"text":"The place is cozy, and service was courteous and friendly, but I wasn't amazed. We tried about 4 different kinds of meatballs and although they all tasted good, none of them stood out. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Very great food! The meatballs were wonderful--recommend the beef BBQ and salmon. Wish they were a little crispier but they were still delicious. The sides we had were amazing though. Great mashed potatoes and ridiculous green beans. I wish I could make them myself!  The atmosphere  is nice. White and intimate. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Belle déco, ambiance chaleureuse et prix abordable. Étant une fan de boulette, j'ai bien apprécié le concept. 
Il y a beaucoup de choix et ce pour tous les gouts (vegé, sans gluten etc.). Parlant gout, c'était bon sans être exceptionnel. Les patates en à-coté étaient bonnes mais j'aurais aimé quelque chose de plus \"cochon\" comme avec du fromage et plus de gout. Le service était correct, ne se démarquant pas particulièrement.
Bref, je recommande ce resto pour une sortie différente avec des amis ou en date."}
{"text":"Lovely place, so so meatballs. 

If you're like me, the number one criteria is the quality and taste of the food. Considering this place does one thing (i.e. meatballs), you'd expect them to be the best damn meatballs you ever did have. This, sadly, is not the case. 

The meatballs were \"whatever\" or \"nothing special\". We tried a bunch, from the classic to the veggie. The only one that kinda stood out was the honey and goat cheese. But even this, was nothing to write home about. 

On the other hand, the space is gorgeous. Decorated like you're sitting in someone's kitchen, you definitely feel comfortable to hang out. The service was also pretty good. 

But purely based on the food, I would give this place a 2 star review."}
{"text":"Meaty and moist, with a few minor disappointments. 

Nini's concept is quite basic, meatballs with a variety of sauces and side dishes. As well as a few options for vegetarians or those that desire gluten free.  In the sense of variations, I don't have much to complain about. Especially when lunch time from Monday-Saturday is $5.00 per dish. Drinks and taxes are extra of course. 

As for the staff, they were quite friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. Their manager was very munch on point. Always glancing at the tables, keeping an eye at all times to see if anybody needed anything and they were satisfied with their food. He did a fantastic job! Also very kind and professional. Bravo!
As for the ambiance. It's simple. It's a basic white on the walls, chairs and tables, with white platters, which is a nice touch to make the food stand out. The bar has a beachy look to it while also being white and well put. As a fan of white decor, I was quite pleased with it. Looking around you will see little touches that makes the ambiance charming. I could do without the TV, which was on mute. Yet, I'm not fond of TV's in restaurants since I go to converse with friends. 

This was my second time at Nini's. This time it was for lunch. My previous time it was for dinner a little over a year ago. Having not remember much of it, except that it was satisfying. I will use my most recent visit as a resource for my review. I will clarify that I do plan on returning again. Perhaps not right away due to some minor disappointments. 

Now about the food. 
On a Wednesday at 12pm during a very busy lunch rush(Reservations are recommended!) I had ordered the chicken meatballs with a wild mushroom sauce along side of mashed potatoes. 
I had a strong focus on the meatballs since this is what the restaurant is all about. Luckily, my mouth and I loved them! They were three medium size, with a strong focus on spices, herbs, tender, and moist! Wonderful! 
However, if you plan to use fresh herbs, on the meatballs please be kind enough to remove the twigs and any big sharp piece of rosemary. That was not pleasant. 
As for the \"wild mushroom sauce\" Indeed it was tasty, but very much on the salty side. While looking for the \"wild\" mushrooms, I was only able to find two pieces of chopped white button mushrooms, which I will say they are not wild. I understand salt is a very inexpensive ingredient to use when flavoring the food. However, when certain ingredients are listed on the menu, I do expect to see them and not have to search for them. 
The mashed potatoes sprinkled with chives had a great creamy, smooth factor. Served extremely hot. I won't lie. They had a few lumps here, and there. Luckily, that did not bother me. 
The dessert, which seems to be yet another strong focus of this restaurant. You have several choices. It seems that most people often choose their build your own ice cream sandwich. I don't blame them. They are outstanding!!
It's quite simple. You pick a variety of cookies with a choice of your ice cream. The cookies are also made by them. They have a strong factor of chewiness and tender. Perfect!
Their ice cream, I don't believe it's homemade. I didn't notice any homemade taste to it. It is quite good.
I had picked a combination of double chocolate, chocolate chunk cookie with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Amazing combination! Be ready to get messy. Then again, that is what napkins are for. So don't worry, get messy!

Their theory on how to serve food is what I find the most disappointing. Three average size meatballs in a bowl, makes it quite challenging to cut, and eat. While the side dishes are placed in another dish. Although the food is served very hot, being separate does make it easier for it to become cold faster. 
I would have liked to have the meatballs with the sauce on a plate, to have ample space to cut them and enjoy them. Alongside of your choice of side dish. The bowls are simply annoying and far too impractical.. How can anyone cut anything inside a bowl?! The experience is suppose to be a pleasure not so much of a challenge. 

Having said all this, I will return and recommend this place to others. However I will also mentioned their minor flaws. In my opinion, I think these flaws could be a bit of a turn off for many foodies out there. Not just me."}
{"text":"We bought a coupon deal on vie urbaine $25 for $50. We went on a Wednesday and it was dead. Why we wondered, the place is super clean and inviting, it has a good mix of music, decor and great people watching windows.
We had 6 dishes, a yellow beet salad, meatball choices of talipia, shrimp, veal/chorizo, vegan, and a bowl of grilled vegetables. All the dishes had their own unique sauce and distinct taste.
Our young waiter was very friendly and we loved the place, so why is this place not more happening?!"}
{"text":"La meilleure place en ville pour des boulettes de toutes sortes! 
Poisson, végétarienne, poulet, chorizo, buf, au fromage de chèvre, etc.
L'ambiance est parfaite!"}
{"text":"Original choices, fresh and fun. Wonderful assortment of flavors and a cocktail that suits the mood. Lovely spot with open walls in summer. Friendly and knowledgable staff. Flavors good but the meat itself was a tad dry. Best brioche! Ice cream cookie sandwich? Yes please! Refreshing and chic."}
{"text":"Le Nini a récemment modifié son menu et a enlevé la majorité des mentions \"sans gluten\" malgré le fait que ce soir toujours les mêmes plats sur le menu. Étrange, non? Il ne reste plus que 3 ou 4 options \"sans gluten\". Dommage. Quoi qu'il en soit, j'y retourne quand même parce que la salade de roquette et le chili végé sont excellents! 

L'ambiance est toujours aussi sympathique et le personnel très gentil."}
{"text":"I loved this little place. The food was excellent, prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was intimate and cozy. The service was also great. Will definitely return for date night again and again. If you go - make sure you get the sugar pie. It was insane."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé ce petit resto/bar de Griffintown. Décor blanc épuré, split level, excellent service :-) Nous avons commandé des boulettes végétariennes et au thon. Les prix sont abordables et l'ambiance est super charmante; endroit parfait pour décompresser, s'amuser et manger santé, si on le veut bien! Options véganes, végétariennes et semi-végétariennes. Aussi sans gluten! Délectables boulettes :D"}
{"text":"Location: In the up and coming Southern part of town. The closest is subway is probably Georges-Vanier (though you'll have to walk from there) - street parking is available, both metered and free. Check the signs to avoid useless parking tickets, though.

The place: I like it. Very clean, big windows, lots of white walls. Some may think it's a little sterile, in a hospital ward kind of way but I found it to be fresh. The space isn't very big so if you plan to go on a weekend night, I would recommend making a reservation. 

The goods: I'll be honest - I'd been looking forward to checking these guys out since I found out about them. Despite not being much of a meat eater, my Italian bloodline necessitates that I love meatballs. It's like, a culinary rule or something. In any case, I know a good meatball when I see it (thanks mama T!). Sadly, Nini's did not blow me away with their meatballs. They offer several different varieties: the traditional beef & Parmesan, chicken and hot sauce, shrimp, and a veggie option as well. I went with what I consider to be the traditional option: beef and Parmesan in a tomato sauce, with a side of linguini (spicy tomato sauce). I was served 3 very small meatballs in one bowl and a separate plate of linguini. I think it makes more sense to get everything in one plate (and with the same sauce) but to each their own, I guess. The meatball was lacking in overall flavor and there was something off about the texture. It was too firm for my liking. Also, the Parmesan was on top of the meatballs in thin sheets. Typically (at least in my experience), Parmesan is used to make the meatballs and therefore part of the mixture. You don't actually see it. In any case, you can easily find better at Elio's, who will happily serve you tennis ball-sized meatballs that rock. 

The pasta, though good, was boxed. What can I say? I like fresh pasta. I should point out that it was perfectly al dente which is a plus for me. I enjoyed the spicy tomato sauce -  it was super tasty and had the right level of zing. For dessert, we tried the deep-fried goat-cheese meatball with spiced honey. This was a definite hit! 

Service: The wait staff was super friendly and quick. They made sure we always had water on hand. 

Price point: Basically, for the amount of food that you're getting, it's too expensive. Also, charging $3 for cold, store-bought bread, to me, is ridiculous. It's a meatball place - what are you supposed to clean up the rest of your sauce with? Your napkin. I think bread should be automatically included free of charge - almost any other restaurant that you walk into will offer bread on the house. 

I wish these guys the best with their new endeavor, but unfortunately, will not be returning."}
{"text":"Still not a fan unfortunately. If you're a meatball house make sure your balls are the best balls I put in my mouth hahah"}
{"text":"Great little place! The gazpacho (cucumber, melon and coconut is to die for). Great concept offering an assortment of meat balls from salmon to beef and vegetarian. Lunches at 5$ are an incredible value. Don't leave without having their dessert: homemade cookies with ice cream. Only point that could be improved : the service. A smile doesn't cost and when you are serving customers (like I do), making them feel welcome is important."}
{"text":"Over priced for what they are offering and i received the Worst customer service EVER. with no one and I mean we were literally the only people in the restaurant. They mess up my order, the waiter then blames it on me, when both my friends clearly heard me when I asked for my goat cheese balls. He comes back and flings the dish in my direction. Finally the waiter hardly apologises before giving me the bill saying that he's charging me for the sweet potato balls that cost one dollar less. As if he was doing me a service!? How insulting! Oh! And the food- the goat cheese balls were too sweet. The portions for the salad are either huge or tiny so depending on what u order you will most likely be starving.  I will not be seen there again. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"It's a nice place with really good food. Only thing is they don't have AC, I don't recommend you go on a hot day."}
{"text":"The ambiance was beautiful! All of the furniture is white, there is lots of light coming in from the windows, brick wall behind the bar, white tiles, mason jars and beautiful individual soft lights that hang from the ceiling. This was my favourite part about the restaurant.

I went on a Wednesday morning for brunch with friends and everything on the menu (meatballs, sides, desserts) were $5 each. The meatballs come in 3 and there is a variety of choices of meats, sauces and vegetarian options as well. I recommend the veal meatballs in spicy tomato sauce, however I don't think the meatballs tasted anything out of the ordinary. The salmon tartare side was also very good but the portions are very small. The creamy polenta was also warm and rich, however not extraordinary. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Very nice, warm decor.

Food (meatballs) were mediocre, at best.
Mashed potatoes... Well, let's just say IKEA mashed potatoes have more flavour. (Ouch)

Service was good, quick and friendly.
Overall experience, reasonable.

Considering this is a Meatball joint, I would have expected much more, especially from the meatballs.

Ballpark is a much better option if you are a meatball lover."}
{"text":"Super resto, vraiment! 
Ambiance et décors lumineux et charmant, service rapide, drink excellent et les boulettes délicieuses!
Seul \"hic\", il ne faut pas aller à ce resto avec une grosse faim, car à moins de prendre un \"à côté\", il n'y a que trois boulettes servies. Aussi, un peu de pain en entré pour complémenter ne serait pas de trop!"}
{"text":"Good meatballs. Ok price. Nice ambiance. The meatballs were a little bit cold. The potatoes were ordinary. 

The service was friendly, and the food came quickly.

Overall, I recommend for light dinners or for lunch, but would not recommend for special occasions."}
{"text":"So to start with the good: The waitress was totally friendly, helpful, funny, attentive without hovering or pushing, gave good suggestions, seemed like a nice person. 

The room is pretty and white without feeling cold, glowy and not overbright, a nice place to spend time, spotless downstairs bathrooms, nice layout, small but not crowded, well done. 

The sauces were really tasty. The wine list is thoughtful, I had an inexpensive biodynamic red that I really enjoyed. 

Unfortunately, it's a meatball restaurant, and if you're going to hang your hat on a potentially gimmicky single food item you had better make the best gosh darn meatballs in the land. And these are definitely not that. Every grandma ever makes better meatballs than these. Three small mealy dry meatballs for 7$ is just a bummer. 

I ordered the classic beef meatballs with a side of linguini in spicy roast tomato sauce. I thought these would be tasty together, but they were served in separate small dishes so it was tough to make that happen. Sacrificing basic dinner deliciousness logic to a food trend concept makes me so sad. 

So anyway. I ended up with all this sauce, which was tasty, leftover in these two different bowls. So I ordered some bread. My waitress, to her credit, flinched a little when she told me the bread would be $3. I ordered it anyway, bc I'm a sucker for punishment? Or because I assumed that at $3 this was going to be some delicious fresh hot homemade bread. Bread that would turn the meal and the night and possibly my whole life around. But alas no. A stale bun the likes of which you can purchase in bulk at Costo was served warmed up, but not warm enough to take the fridge cold out of the center. Serious mega so much bummer.  Good thing the company was lovely =)"}
{"text":"The meatballs were good, but not the side dishes or the service. We got seated at the bar and the bartender kept staring at my girlfriend. 
We got several different variations of meatballs including salmon, falafel, beef with bacon  and chicken. 
Got mashed potato and eggplant for sides. Also got a salad for starter. 
The ice cream sandwich was really really sweet, but besides that, it was tasty."}
{"text":"Arrived in Montreal hungry with no clue where to stop for a snack. Just walked around until we came across this place. The service was great. We mainly got the traditional meatballs and my husband got the pork chorizo. We also  got the tortellini and cheesy polenta sides. All the food was amazing. My kids loved the food too. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Fun and trendy, good down to earth food. 

It's hard at times to find a restaurant that will satisfy the diverse tastes of a group of people. Nini makes this possible with a wide array of different meatballs, ranging from fish and vegetarian to full meat-lovers. Paired with some delicious sides, and your table will soon fill with several plates of yummy bites. The restaurant is small, cozy, and trendy (however the bathroom is at the bottom of a long, steep set of stairs) and the staff is just as fun.

Fun date for two? Nini. Diverse group of friends who enjoy sharing plates? Nini."}
{"text":"i went there with some friends from my swimming class and we had a great time. We took the menu from MTL a table, so we had to choose one appetizer, entree and desert from a list. I took the endive salad with whole nuts, my main was four vegetarian \"meatballs\" with sautéed potatoes, and the desert was an apple turnover. Everything was super tasty, at the beginning i thought the portions were small, but at the end of the meal i was so full. The meatballs were super tasty and well seasoned, the salad was a bit dry but i just love so much whole nuts that i didn't care. I am for sure coming back, maybe for a lunch because they have a 5$ menu."}
{"text":"Super bouffe, bel endroit, bon service. 
Belle expérience en général. 
Pas vraiment child-friendly par contre car pas de chaise-haute disponible."}
{"text":"Cute little place located in Griffintown, I went with two others friends and shared the meatballs (which all come in 3's). Meatballs were great, price was good, and the service was good as well. Portions are small, tapas-sized so don't think you'll leave the place extremely full. Overall the concept is quite cute and kid-friendly.

I might return with a couple of friends if we're ever in the neighbourhood and in search of a snack."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! We ordered bunch of meatballs to share between us, we had 6 orders for 4 people and 2 sides, more than enough."}
{"text":"Remember when you used to think that Subway had the hottest meatball sandwich game in town? Well not anymore! Nini just snatched the title from their evil clutches and the city is better for it. The bun was as fluffy as a pillow. There was enough gooey cheese to drown a mouse. And the meat balls... oh, the meatballs! First off, they come in virtually every animal you can think of, aquatic and terrestrial. Seriously. I didn't see kangaroo on the menu, but I'm sure they could hook it up if you asked. Secondly, they are some of the most tender, flavourful, melt-in-your-meat nuggets you've ever tasted. So next time you're craving bite sized bits of ground cow/chicken/etc, spare yourself the trip to IKEA and wing it over to Nini's."}
{"text":"No joke. We were kicked out by a very annoyed server/bully because we left a 10% tip. He held the door open and told us \"DON'T COME BACK\" while he waited for us to leave. Who does that? Wow, touchy! Seriously buddy suck it up, take a breath & use it as a learning experience. No need to blow a fuse. Bravo, you just showed you deserved even less than 10%. 

After leaving 10% he asked us why & we said it's because he insisted we ordered 4 meatballs & not 3.  He then insisted again we ordered 4. Wow, stubborn AND pushy. Customer is always ... WRONG!! Not cool to have to insist to send food back. 

Why all the fuss? This waiter needs to work on his softer side and be less confrontational and stubborn. The food was very good and the 5$ lunch special is great. The Thai meatballs were especially good. Our friend works 2 blocks away and comes all the time but you have technically banished him. Thanks. I hope your pride was worth it. 

For the clients - be careful about leaving 10% or disagreeing with your server."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for meatballs. Brings me back to my childhood neighbourhood in Rosemont and my neighbour, Mrs. Sila, who was always cooking a batch of pasta and/or meatballs for us kids to sample.

So I like this place. Meatballs are nice (not great) and varied. I sample three: one veggie, one veal, one chicken. Will try more inventive offerings soon. Side of mashed potatoes is good. Caponata is meh-ish. Bread is ok. But pricing is very reasonable and the spot is charming and stylish in a casual way.

Looks like they make good drinks though I haven't sampled yet - was driving w daughter as precious cargo. Their old fashioned was mega aromatic though!!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here. My friend proposed this place and we were not disappointed! The food was excellent and there is a great atmosphere! The food is served tapas style and great to share.  The ice cream sandwiches were also excellent.  Recommended!"}
