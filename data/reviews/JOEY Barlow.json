{"text":"Got the filet migon with peper corn sauce
It comes with the best crispy mashed potatoes ever
I came here a couple of weeks ago and i just had to come back
I also got the molten chocolate lava cake.
Wow it was great
The service is one of the best i got in Calgary
This is now my favorite restaurant 
If you crave for the best steak then you got to go to Joey's"}
{"text":"We went here with my parents and my youngest daughter to meet my aunt & uncle for lunch.  It was a Monday, and when we got there at noon it was starting to get really busy.  We managed to get a table for 7, and were seated quickly.  

The decor was very nice, and the waitresses looked like those girls in the Robert Palmer videos - all in black dresses, same body type/looks, etc.  I was worried they weren't going to accommodate my daughter, as it didn't look overly kid-friendly.  Our waitress was amazing though and was great with her.

My daughter was already very hungry so she got the kids size pasta before we ordered our food.  She really liked it and ate most of it.  We also got her an ice cream, to tide her over while we ate our meal.  Again, the waitress was very sweet to her and brought her items quickly.

I ordered the Lobster Grilled Cheese with Fries.  It was very good, but not spectacular (the cheese overpowered the taste of the lobster).  Hubby had the Ahi Tuna burger, which was tasty ( the sauce was great).  I had a Bellini as well, which was awesome on this hot day!!

The prices were ok, but the service was excellent.  We'd consider coming back here without kids for a special date night."}
{"text":"Great food excellent service. The staff seem to have worked out the new protocol, good job! My steak was perfect med rare, the waitress told me to order it rare to get my med, she was right on the mark. Thank you all for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Came in after a wedding with my cuzins. Went to the lounge and they had amazing music. Frank Greco the manager was absolutely amazing and so accommodating . he not only gave is great customer service but actually came out and had a great conversation with us.  Normally you never see the manager unless there is a problem however you can tell Frank loves his job and takes the time to review how his costomers are doing. Great job done!!! You made our night Frank keep up the good work and we will keep coming back! Thank you for giving us a memorable night."}
{"text":"Really tasty menu items! Also, they definitely don't chaunce out when pouring drinks if you know what I mean. 
For the gentlemen out there: the waitresses are definitely nice to look at haha. Our waitress was awesome, however some of the other girls were walking around, texting on their phone the whole time.....I wish I could get paid to do that!
I would go back if I was ever in the area again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"For the price, I wasn't really impressed.  Upscale atmosphere, average food, Mojito's are made from mix and  terrible, I sent it back and still got charged for it.

The Crab and Goat Cheese dip was excellent

The Ahi Tuna Tacos were ok

The Fish Tacos were good

Will I eat there again?   With huge selection Calgary has to offer, probably not."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend. Filet with blue cheese butter was fantastic. The blue cheese butter adds a bit of sweetness and mild bite that pairs excellent with the steak. Bonus was the fried mashed potato rolls. What a cool idea. Great wine. Service is exemplary. Very friendly staff including the manager. Does all the extra little things to make you feel welcome and thrilled you made he choice to dine with them. Definitely a return trip here."}
{"text":"Great bar, good food,Ebony is definitely the best, funnest bartender in the northeast! The Shiraz also, is better then my own.:)"}
{"text":"Man oh man, how I wanted to say good things about this place but it's just so hard to get good service here. We usually come here with customers given it's so close to one of our offices but, really, what can you do. We tip well, manager has seen us plenty of times but with the dwindling standards in Calgary this place seems to be no exception."}
{"text":"The situation was: came in at about 9 pm for dinner. Place was busy but not packed. Ordered the house salad and herb crush salmon. Salad was good but a little small for a salad (specifically ordered the house salad because it was supposed to be bigger than a side salad). Salmon was good, too, but again on the smaller side, especially for $26. Service was average only - waited about 10 minutes for the salad.  I might have given 4 stars but overall didn't quite make it. Now the bad: the too loud, techno dance music constantly blaring will keep me from coming back. It was really annoying.

Added note: when the waitress came with the bill she exclaimed, \"it got really busy there for a while.\"  Like that should make me feel okay? Originally had my rating at 3 stars but that remark made me drop to 2."}
{"text":"Kobe beef meatballs, fish tacos, shrimp seafood raviolis and the best waitstaff=5 stars.  Thank you for an outstanding experience in Calgary."}
{"text":"After a long day of hiking and scrambling, nothing could have been a better reward than feasting at Joey Barlow. Amazing food complemented by great service from gorgeous staffs."}
{"text":"WhY has happened to this place.... 5 years of loyalty and now sh!t rude surveys.  Wow.  Not impressed begged off 4 months ago came back today and the last visit.   Unreal."}
{"text":"Myself, I eat out multiple times each day and not because i want to but because I constantly travel. Although I do eat at fast food establishments, every once in a while I like to enjoy a meal that appears and tastes as if it has been created by a chef . Joeys Barlow does this well and I enjoy the atmosphere. If I have to meet for business I will  try, if possible, to arrange to meet there so there are no surprises with the food, atmosphere or service. I have not had one bad experience yet.
I have to admit that it can be a bit loud at certain times when it is very busy, so I find if arrange your business meeting for mid afternoon it is quieter.
Try their salads, they are quite good, and I don't normally like salads. (My wife tells me they are good for me.)
I will continue to eat there."}
{"text":"So....I just had an amazing experience at THIS location and thought I should write a review while I'm at it. I think they may have changed a thing or two because the roast chicken was awesome! Our waiter, Curtis, such a good waiter, loved his approach and attitude. Service was quick and they paid great attention to our needs. Presentation of the food was very nice. Honestly, I think this restaurant has been unfairly rated. I had vowed to never go to a Joey Tomatoes ever again after my experiences at the Crowfoot location, but now I'm sold on this location(Barlow). Curtis, if you see this, and I hope you do, thank you! :)"}
{"text":"Oh man, where do I start? 

It started off OK.  The waitress took our drink order, and then came back (reasonably) promptly to take our food orders.  Then... the waiting started.  We probably waited 45 minutes for our food without anyone giving us an update on its status!  Totally unacceptable.  

Finally, the food came.  One of our party (of five) noticed that the chicken on her salad was not cooked.  The offending dish was sent back and replaced.  My salad (sashimi tuna salad) was absolutely tiny!  I thought it was listed under the \"big salad\" heading on the menu, oh wait, IT IS.  They seemed to have mysteriously left off the mixed greens that were supposed to come in it, and the mango as advertised was limited to two, super hard, tiny pieces that were not even ripe enough to eat.   Plus, there were chow mein noodles in it!  This was not listed at all in their menu description.

The seared ahi tuna was stone-cold and did not appear as if it was cooked to order.  I'm not 100% sure but I don't think this is common practice.   I asked for some more greens due to the size of the salad and they brought me out a (tiny) mixed greens salad, then added a 6.99 charge to the bill to correct their own error!

At least they comped the salad where the chicken was uncooked, and credited the charge of 6.99 for my 'additional' salad.  The food was actually pretty decent but due to the ongoing saga of mistakes during our lunch time, I won't be visiting any Joey's location in the future if I can help it.

If you are in the area and looking for that sort of food, do yourself a favour, go to earls or cactus club instead, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"i have been here on two different occasions.  Both times I have been impressed with the over all experience.  

First time i went was a Friday night late supper.  We received prompt seating which is impressive. There was a very short wait for our server who was knowledgeable in all aspects of the menu.  Drinks were brought quickly and our order was taken and delivered in a timely and correct manner.  

Second visit was a mid week Lunch.  Again, prompt seating (lounge side). Drinks and meal were served very quickly yet did not feel pushed or rushed in any way. Server was able to make accurate descriptions of the appetizers and salads.  Food was exactly as the server described.
 
All of the servers were dressed in the same dress. Classic black, length just above the knee, no visible tattoos or body piercings (which i personally appreciate) and dress pumps for shoes.  I find this style to be very classic and tasteful.

I would most definitely return here on any day or night of the week."}
{"text":"The food is quite delicious.  I higly recommend the Thai salad and the Beach salad. The waitresses and managers were very friendly.  Maxine the hostess was extremely helpful and polite."}
{"text":"They are okay. Its a chain. The girls look like Barbie dolls in matching dresses. It always makes me a bit crazy when restaurants think that its a neat thing to force employees to wear more makeup than they normally wood and dress in barely there matching frocks.

The menu describes the food you get pretty well. I've never had a terrible meal but there is nothing super exciting either. I do enjoy the Beach salad they have and the steak is good  - pretty standard although their side sauces are a rip off for what you get.

They have a decent drink menu with some atypical options like Negronis. Service is usually pretty decent. This location is pretty large so they can accommodate larger groups. It can get pretty loud in there though - after a recent dinner my voice started to go just from attempting to have a normal conversation.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go here but if I was in the neighbourhood and wanted something easy, I'd consider returning."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. What more could you ask for?

I had the rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables. Everything tastes great and the chicken was huge.

It is a moderately high end restaurant, laminar not the best spot for kids."}
{"text":"great bar staff who remember you, love the tuna salad, very accommodating for special food requests"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Saturday, celebrating a friend cousin birthday. Of course since Joey's is a chain restaurant, wasn't expecting much. Plus I've been here a couple of times. But my most recent experience felt very mediocre. The food fell a little short from my expectation from my past visit. 

We ordered appetizers to begin Artichoke and spinach dip as well as calamari. The Calamari tasted good. Full of flavour and presentation was nice, the artichoke and spinach dip not a fan. It was and and soupy not really the dip consistency. I ordered the Protein style burger, I thought this was a great addition to the menu. Since I haven't seen it before but maybe I could be wrong and it has been on the menu for over a year, it was alright. The burger itself lacked seasoning it tasted very bland. Even the sauce added didn't help at all, very mediocre. My friend ordered the fish tacos and out of the 3 she ate 1. She said the shrimp and fish were soggy and not crunchy too much oil soaked them. I tried one and she was right. I remember ordering them last visit and they were much better before instead of how they are now. Possibly a change of chef? 

Lastly my cousin the birthday girl ordered the chicken Shawarma and please don't get me started, she hardly touched it. It was a lot smaller in size my friend added since she ordered that before. My cousin even showed me how much grease was dripping off the Shawarma wrapper. I was disgusted. The only perk I would say is the skinny fries on the side still tasted the same as I remember pretty good. 

Overall personally I'm little saddened how the food has gone down. As I recall Joeys used to be pretty good. Hmm that's unfortunate."}
{"text":"It's an upscale restaurant and lounge decorated with brick and dark wood beams. Medium sized, not large.  Dark. I sat in the lounge with tv screens.   My waitress was polite but not engaging.  Music in the lounge was loud. The crispy chicken peanut salad was small and not filling for a man.  Big on presentation.  They skimped on the arugula and chicken.  Beware the jalapeños!  I expected more for $18.  But they have happy hour drink specials which makes up for it.  Good for after work drinks.   And plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"I've been lazy...  I meant to update my review month's ago, but put it off until I just plain forgot about it.
The change to the chicken dish I mentioned in my review?  The chicken now has the sun-dried tomato heavy back!  Thank you Joeys!
Sadly, it still comes with rice, but they were more than happy to substitute potato for me.
I now have nothing at all to complain about.  :)"}
{"text":"I'm back again. 

My review remains the same: great food and service day-in and day-out. I tried their mushroom soup this time around, and it didn't meet the hype. Aside from that, a consistent high-end casual restaurant to go."}
{"text":"Dinner last night at Joey Barlow's was a positive experience.  We had a pretty good server for our party of six. He recommended the seared ahi tuna club. It was very tasty, BUT it most certainly was not \"seared\". The tuna steak was cooked through.  Still, it was a nice sandwich. As one of two designated drivers, I did not imbibe however, our party enjoyed their lemonade drinks and supersonic gin and tonics.  Nice vibe on the patio. Good crowd still there when we left st 9:30. All in all, good dining experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good. On business in the frozen North for a couple of days, Joey's was near our hotel. Went with a couple of work buddies. Got there about 6:30 on a Thursday night and it was already pretty crowed and loud...which was what we were looking for.

For anyome that has been here the obvious first attraction for 3 middle aged business traveling were Joey's very young and very attractive wait staff of young ladies in short skirts and high heels. On a scale of 1-10, most all at least an 8.

We chose a high top table in the bar and were promptly served some beverages, decent beer list but Canada has a ways to go on the craft beer movement. We told our waitress that we were not in a hurry and she waited on us with just the right amount of service, we were never pressured to order.

We ordered the Calimari appetizer and a Spinch Dip to start, nothing special but tasty, the Calamrai was a bit soggy. For the main meal I had the Steak & Sushi, average cut of Teriaki steak and pretty sad Rainbow Roll.

I would go back the Joey's for sure, the wait staff was hot and hip, it was loud and they had large screen TV's in the bar. The beers were cold, but don't expect much from the food."}
{"text":"Joey Barlow is my safe spot, what I mean by that is when we can't decide where want to eat we always end up at Joey's. Not because Joey's has the best food in the city or that it's service rivals the best of the best but truly because my experience there is usually always average or above.

Like usual on a Friday night the entire restaurant from lounge to dining room was packed full of people having a bite to eat and enjoying a drink or two. I understand when I see a restaurant this packed I am going to expect service to be lower than usual if it wasn't.

Our server was nice, I know she tried really hard to be a good server but without much organization means she is slow and it pretty much takes asking two or three times before we get what we need.

I had a crappy experience of having the Chimchurri Steak during lunch hour at The Barley Mill so I wanted a re-do (I really wanted steak) so I got the 7oz cab sirloin that comes with the crispy mashed potatoes (my favorite thing in the world) and some roasted vegetables.

Unlike The Barley Mill who's Medium Rare steak ended up being like Medium to Medium-Well my steak at Joey's although it's never always perfect was made exactly to how I wanted a Medium Rare steak to be like.

The other reason why I like Joey's is because it's much like pub Cheers. You always know people who are there and eventually the waitresses know your name. Ha."}
{"text":"We came for cocktails and Happy Hour!!!!
Where else in the city can you get a Bellini for under $3? They are rolling back the prices to back when Joey Tomatoes first opened.
Happy Hour prices on appetizers $3.50 each for a tuna sushi cone, slider or a taco. The sushi cone was so good that I had 3!
Bill under $20.00"}
{"text":"I had the top sirloin med rare, and butterflied shrimp.  Partner had the salmon. No drinks. $64 not including tip.  Total bill $80.  Nothing to write home about.  Standard \"Keg type\" fare.  Steak was cooked correctly, server was cheerful and polite etc. Two exceptions:

1) When I asked what the special was, I was informed that the 'featured item'  was... (I cant even remember).  Upon further inquiry it was determined that \"featured item\" is a euphemism for \"Listen buddy, if you want a deal, go to the Keg, we don't do 'specials' here...now you gonna order, or what?\"  (What they actually said was \"The featured item is the same item at the same price as what is on the menu\".)
Wait...whut?

2) My partner observed that her meal was heavily salted. 
Look guys, we can always add more salt.  It is the separation that is difficult OK? FML!

I honestly don't know why I would return here or recommend this restaurant.  Prices are comparable with other high-end restaurants, but the restaurant is very noisy, a number of tables are in the middle of the floor in a high server traffic area, and the food is meh.  For my restaurant dollar in Calgary, I can name several superior options. (Earls is NOT one of them). 

This establishment does not respect their clients enough to offer a daily special, and notches up the insult by suggesting a regularly priced menu item is just like a special.

Read more about both these restaurants (\"Joeys\" and \"Earls\") on ratemyemployer.ca.  You will get the drift."}
{"text":"The food at all the Joey's is great... I enjoy their menu. Though recently I found that I can eat a lot better in downtown for a lot cheaper with much better service.

In regards to this location specifically... I am just SO sick of the service. Of course I go a few times, just in case the first, second, or third time the waitress was having a bad day. 

However, enough is enough. My recent experience: 55 mins for a table for a party of 8. On my stroll to the bathroom I saw several tables that easily could have been pushed together... whatever. 

The server was great, until my cousin asked her to split the bill, all of a sudden there was a complete attitude change. I just can't understand the challenge with this. 

Initially when we had come in I had given the hostess a really nice cake in a box, she informed me to let our server know. I told our server initially we have a cake with some candles can you bring it out for dessert. 

I reminded her at the end of our meal, she slams down 8 plates in front of each of us, also gave away any surprise element. I guess our server was too busy doing other things and asked the hostess to bring out the cake. The hostess brings me the cake in the box in the bag.... uhh WTF. I asked her to just leave it in the bag, bring us our bills. 

This was completely unacceptable to me, please don't act like this is the first time someone brought a birthday cake. We've done it several times everywhere else. Unfortunately you guys don't bake cakes (yup I called an asked) and told me it would be no prob to bring in one of our own. 

I come down hard on servers, or lack of service. If your working in that industry your one and only purpose is to deliver outstanding customer service. If you can't do that then get a new job."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in here is great and the wait staff that evening was nice. I had the chicken Katsu salad and sushi cone with shrimp.

The salad was good, but too much of the peanut dressing IMO. I'd pass on the sushi roll/cone. For $5, I'd rather get a real hand roll elsewhere."}
{"text":"Five stars you say? Yes indeed.  I work close to this Joeys and am usually here  2 to 3 times a month. It is always busy - so we arrive early to avoid the rush, but even at 1140ish, its getting busy.  When you walk in, you are typically greeted by smiling staff - attractive guys and gals dressed smartly. ( Smartly - god that makes me sound old!) 
This restaurant has a combination of booths, four tops and a few round tables ( we have often had 10 or more from work around them).  

So - onto the food - as a vegetarian it can be difficult to find decent offerings. Not the case here, they use Gardein here  ( the vegetarians know what I mean - a protein substitute sent from the gods - Vancouver actually) and work it into many items - Souvlaki, butter  \"chicken\" as well as other items.  Many times, I have had the veggie souvlaki - its delicous.  Strips of grilled spiced Gardein, with tzatziki, tomatoes, lettuce, wrapped in a warm pita bread - Always very fresh, might I add.  I have the house salad - which is really nice. Dried cranberries, crumbled feta and crunchy nut like things ( sorry I cant be more specific) with a nice lemon dressing  My coworkers often have the butter chicken and my one East  Indian friend  who is particularly critical of Indian food- raves about it.  I take that as a pretty good endorsement. 
 One time recently it was so busy,  we set along the ledge that faced into the kitchen ( did I mention part of it is a open kitchen) and it was great. We could see the young cooks working like a well oiled machine, rolling sushi, making salads, flatbreads etc.  The service was still excellent, and it was suprisingly fun to watch 
What always strikes me about this place is consistency - clearly they have lots of training for the staff and manage the place well.  As it is so busy, there is no room for slow servers, cooks or poor quality food.   The place has a definite buzz to it - and considering its lunchtime in the NE - it feels more like Stephen Avenue at dinner.. 
The service is always friendly and there is a great team spirit here, it is reflected in the attentive service and proactive approach to the tables ( e.g. bringing over refills of soft drinks when they are almost empty - without asking). 
Price wise - its good value for the overall experience. On average, I can have a good lunch with soft drink and tip for about 20 bucks.  To the owners of Joeys, keep up the good work, and to the staff - thanks for all the great service.  We will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I travel to Calgary regularly and stay at a hotel across the street from Restaurant Row, so there is always lots to choose from. Last week I chose Joey Barlow and was looking forward to it as I've only been there twice before just for drinks on the patio.

Joey Barlow is, HIP & LOUD. If  you're having dinner you might want to dine on the patio since it will be more enjoyable. The restaurant is very large and who knows how or why it's always so busy, because it certainly isn't the great food. Food is average, and the space echos and between the loud music and the loud conversations it's not very relaxing (I sound like my grandmother, but it was not good believe me ! ). 

Had dinner with a college and we both shared the Calamari appetizer, (which was okay -- little soggy)  we each had Chicken Caesars and two drinks and the tab was over $85.00.

My friend (a guy) loved that all the staff were young ladies in their 20's. They were cute and hopefully won't stay with serving as a career choice, since they don't write anything down and don't remember very well. 

Will still have drinks on the patio in the summer, but will go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent roti chicken w Cole slaw and fries , order xtra gravy

The staff are great and gorgeous too"}
{"text":"For three years  we've hit Joey's for my freinds' birthday sometime in early July for lunch.

Lunch this Monday was great as always.   We had an professional cook with us this time from a rival restauarnt.  So we had great fun dissecting the three dishes we chose:  Lobster ravioli,  Lobster Grilled Cheese and the Mexican Fish tacos.   The Lobster Grilled Cheese was great for mouth, bad not a low fat, treat.  Still on the Yum scale we gave it 4 out of 5. 

Because we're close freinds, we shared nibbles of each other's meals.  And had drinks.  The service was good, the food better.   We would like to see the Long Island Iced Tea in a Tall glass rather than a old fashioned glass, but hey, it's good to broaden your horizons.

For an additional $1.49 we were able to get house side salads with two of our meals,  a very good combination of baby  greens, cranberries, nuts and a healthy portion of cheese and the dressing was perfect for the mix.

When I read other reviews I was surprised to see the sauces compared to jarred sauces.  I can tell the difference between 'jarred' and 'created' salad dressing and sauce.  Joey's dressings and sauces are not from a jar.

Okay, the hot sauce was a name brand jar sauce,  but c'mon folks!  I defy anyone to make a hot sauce from scratch daily!  

Before you criticize a restaurant for supposedly 'jarred' sauces,  ask your server what's in it.   Almost all the servers can run back to the kitchen and ask what exactly is in a sauce.   And at Joey's they will tell you.  Not the exact measurements but certainly all the ingredients.   

Also,  the behind the scenes cooking entails a fairly decent math brain for portining and every dish is prepared in a certain 'bill time\"  fresh daily, and  with a precision  and speed you can't even begin to imagine. 
 
Our Cook told us all these things and we are glad of it, because to know people in the kitchen were working hard to earn our hard earned money made the meals even better!

{"text":"My boyfriend and I took his father here for fathers day this year. When you walk in you know automatically that the food and service are going to be good. We got a flat bread pizza to start and it was amazing. I got the Chicken burger and my boyfriend got the blue cheese steak. I will start out saying that the chicken burger was AMAZING. Most places that I go out to eat I get chicken and usually said chicken is good, but nothing truly delicious. That is not the truth for Joeys. It was phenomenal and I ate every piece. My boyfriend said the steak was delicious as well. Cooked the way he wanted (medium rare) and very tasty. The service was also very nice. Our server actually sat and talked to us for quite some time, which I would normally really enjoy, however it was fathers day and we were trying to have a conversation. Regardless, I would definitely recommend going here and will go here again. 

I recently was able to check out the Joeys in Chinook and that place sucked so badly compared to here. If you want to enjoy the food, go to Joey Barlow!!!!! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Food quality is the same as all the Joey's locations, but the service here was less than average.  Seated just after 2 so it looked fully staffed but took too long to have our drink order taken and to get the bill at the end."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Not sure why but Joey seems to be a bit more popular than Earls next door. It's more difficult than it should be to find an IPA in Calgary. Fortunately, they have a nice one here. Had the steak and sushi. The steak was tasty. The sushi (roll) was so so."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this location at all i have been here so many times and every time something goes wrong. Last time i went i got sick, took a bite of a VERY raw chicken wing :/.  After that time i am not going back, because i usually give it another chance and order something different but i am so disgusted. i will add that the waitress was very nice about it and the manager gave us free dessert and didn't charge us for anything.  I also found that if you are dining with one other person everything goes well but with big groups it doesn't go well at all."}
{"text":"Joey's is a classic place for us when we come to Calgary because we usually fly in late and this is the only place open. I don't come to Calgary often so I can only base this review on my most recent visit. 

The service was nice and fast while the food is always consistently good. I do not really have anything to complain about. We ordered a chili chicken for appetizer and I got the panang shrimp curry bowl. It was the perfect amount of spice and it filled me up.

Pros:
- Open late
- Good service
- Consistent food

Cons:
- Nothing"}
{"text":"Absolutely must try the korean spiced bbq cauliflower - #ADDICTED!!!
Talked about it with coworkers who all tried it and loved it!
Talked about this again tonight at work, we are ordering takeout tomorrow before we get here!"}
{"text":"Big Fan of the Food, everything thing on the menu is great, always consistent. The last time I went to Joeys, the chili chicken was cold, but the staff are always helpful and replaced it ASAP. The service is good most of the time, they have a huge turn over in staff, so sometimes the service takes long and the food, the ahi tuna salad is among my favourite salads of all time. The steaks are not good, but great! They use the finest meats and ingredients. You can always depend in joeys."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time in 10 years after Joey's Tomato had a make over.

I really liked the vibe, and the service was awesome.  All the servers, male and female, were VERY good looking.  The place was packed.

I had the chicken souvlaki with mock chicken and it was SUPERB.  rest of the dishes around the table were excellent too.  Prices were reasonable for Alberta given the high prices everywhere else.  

Would def go back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last weekend - seating was easy enough as we got in rather late. As a table, we ordered the chili chicken - which was pretty good, and the tandoori chicken naan flatbread - that was kind of eh. For my entree, I ordered the ahi tuna tacos - a bit on the small side, but I would have expected a wee bit more than one tiny slab of tuna per taco. Cry face."}
{"text":"Wings where amazing my flight go here a little late and I found the only open bar my hotel. The bartender was so nice and recommended the wings and they are pretty good I just wish they would have given me more blue cheese but other than that I will definitely be visiting again. They have a variety of choices on the menus from sushi to burgers it's great for a casual girls night out or a romantic date"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since I've been to Joey's, infact they've changed their name to Joey's Barlow now. We decided to come out for a birthday dinner with the kids. It was busy and they seated us in the \"kids section\" with other families (initially not impressed).

I had the BC Halibut and Prawn Spaghettini. Being from the West Coast I enjoy fish and have been eating it a very long time. The halibut was slightly overcooked. I mentioned it to the waiter when he asked how things were and the response I got was less than stellar \"oh really? I'll let the chef know\". And that was that...no apology, nothing (kind of like I didn't know what I was talking about).  Besides the halibut being overcooked the dish was delicious. Husband had steak with crispy mashed potatoes. He hardly took time to breathe while he ate, an indicator it was also very tasty. 

The downside to this restaurant is they do not have a kids menu.  My daughter ordered chicken fingers and they did not have any option for dipping sauce and gave her thai chili sauce (like really?..she did not enjoy it at all).  Since this restaurant does not cater to children, we were shoved to the back corner with our kids and the waiter was lacking in customer service...I'm not so sure we will be back.  Plus it was way overpriced.

When I go to a restaurant and pay alot of money I expect the entire experience to be great, not just good.  Here's hoping others have better experiences at Joey's because I really want to like this place!!"}
{"text":"Have not been here in a while but settled in on it. The service was decent. We got the Calamari Frititi which was standard, some were thought to be squid was actually onion rings. I got the Steak and Sushi, presentation was rather nice, the sushi was tasty but I could not agree on the steak, pre-cut and the broth/sauce was slightly awkward. Maybe the idea of it was to be like a Tataki dish but slices were a bit thick so I had to cut it again and dip it in the broth felt like a beef fondue! The wife got the Bistro Plate but did not seem any different than Chicken with coleslaw and fries. Chicken was slightly dry and slightly bland. Cannot say I'll be back too soon, hopefully a menu change will occur before then."}
{"text":"Joeys is close to our shop and convenient. I eat out every day and this food I'd always good.i think the diversity in the menu is what I like ....try the fish tacos. You will love them."}
{"text":"A veeery poor experience, consistent through my three visits there. Taking in account the prices of the place, I am honestly puzzled as why there were enough people to fill that huge a room. Maybe it is sort of a social thing for the locals - not that much about food or service, but mostly for meeting the right people? I can't tell, I was just a visitor in Calgary.

So for me the food was barely at three stars, for the price which corresponded to five stars. Service was at four stars - but only when there was any. Usually we were spending most of the time there waiting for the waitress. Portion size was ok - but not overwhelming, which may be expected to balance the quality with quantity.

Overall - no reason to waste your time and money, especially when there is that spectacular Flat Iron thing literally across the parking lot!"}
{"text":"We came here after I got kicked out of Toad and Turtle because I could not prove that I was over 18 T^T; but, I'm not too upset about it because we came here! I had the veggie burger and it was quite good! The burger is handmade (according to my friends who used to work in Joey's kitchen) and not frozen. The sauce wasn't overly heavy and the sesame seed bun was very sesame seedy. The burger is topped with avocado, alfalfa sprouts, red onion, and the regular fixings. The patty was a little dry but not as dry as most of the veggie burgers I've had and doesn't veer into being overly greasy either. If you get a burger or sandwich I highly recommend subbing yam fries in for regular fries. They come with a truffle lemon aioli that is sooo good and the fries themselves are nice and sweet. Overall, probably one of the better Joey's I've been to!"}
{"text":"There are a number of restaurants in the area and we decided to try Joey Barlow.  When I walked in and saw the hostesses in their short, tight, black dresses and 4 inch heels, I was confused with another chain restaurant and then I thought maybe this is a place for men only.  It was only during our meal that my friend pointed out there were majority of men in the establishment.  It could be most were working men coming through the city or maybe Hooters across the street was too busy.

We were seating quickly in the restaurant area which is more comfortable than the lounge.  Unless you want to watch the game, I would recommend the restaurant.  Since I had a big lunch, I decided to get 3 sushi cones with shrimp tempura, avocado, and cucumber with mayo on the side.  They were priced at $3.49 each which is pricey for sushi but this was not your local sushi place.  My friend chose the mushroom cheddar burger with a salad.  

It was a long wait for our food; at least half an hour.  Maybe they were out gathering the shrimp and butchering the cow? Once I received my food, I could understand the price.  Half of what they charge was likely for the thingy that my sushi was served in.  The sushi tasted ok and there was nothing special about it.  My friend's burger looked good and they added a large slice of tomato, along with lettuce and onion.  She said the salad was very good.  We decided to share the apple pie dessert which came with a scoop of ice cream.  Again, nothing spectacular but a nice warm apple dessert is always good

Our server was good and it was nice of him to apologize for the long wait and then came by to let us know that our bill was taken care of.  That deserves an extra half star if I could give add it on.  

The restaurant can get noisy and crowded so if you are looking for a quiet meal, I suggest going elsewhere.  I'm not sure I will be back with all the restaurants to chose from in the area."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and delightful waitress, will be a return customer. Seating is close quartered which is the only downfall I could identify."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to this location my food and server are always great. I've tried a few different dishes here and they're all pretty delicious. I find it surprising to find a Canadian restaurant that is able to serve and make different cultured dishes and make it work. If I'm looking for something set for dinner night Joey's is a definite turn to."}
{"text":"Staying near the Calgary Airport before the next day's early morning flight we were looking for a good meal and were pleased to find this casual yet upscale place. Usually all you find near airports are the typical chains. This place was hopping at 8:30pm on a Saturday - it was a fun, young crowd. The menu had many good choices at reasonable prices. I selected the roasted chicken bistro plate which was quite good and due to the brining not dry. The frites were excellent. My partner had the fish/ shrimp tacos which were also very good. Our waitress was attentive and efficient. If staying near the airport Joey's is highly recommended.

{"text":"Great atmosphere, fast service and delicious food -- I recommend this spot for quiet meals or team dinners and anything in between.

I had a veggie burger (surprise)! My dinner companions had a NY strip, The 500 salad (add chicken) and a barbecue salmon rice bowl. Everyone enjoyed their meals also the salmon in the bowl was a little underwhelming. 

I wish I had room for dessert but maybe next time."}
{"text":"So after some constant badgering from my girl friends I gave Joey's another chance after 2 prior dismal visits.

Proud to report visit number 3 was just as disappointing!

We started with lettuce wraps, well if you love VH dressings in a jar, thats what you will get here. And lots of it!  Hardly any chicken in the mix and just too much sauce-so much that it overpowers the flavours of everything else. Booo

I decided to order the safest thing on the menu.  Seriously how can you F up roast chicken with mashed taters?  Well our good pal Joey did so with flying colors.  The chicken was soooo salty that I could have sworn they got it shipped over from Swiss Chalet, no offence Swiss Chalet, you too, suck (more to come on that)  The potatoes were ok, and the gravy was good, the veg was bland and nothing special.  Thumbs down.

Friends had the following and respectively here are my opinions as well as theirs:

Creamy Chicken Alfredo- better off buying Classico jarred and grilling your own chicken, bland, not enough punch in a good restaurant Alfredo, and had way better at cheaper price. Chicken was good, but not enough...sigh....

Panang Prawn curry- Overly spicy, but ok if you like it hot, not enough prawn, if you get this with rice it is literally a cup clumped together into a gelatinous mound in the middle of the dish, so gross...get the naan instead, much better and very tasty!

Viva Salad- for $17 I don't think it is justifiable to spend this amount of money on greens, sorry, just my opinion and it wasn't that stellar.  Mix of ingredients didn't compliment each other well.

Steak- I don't understand why some restaurants don't identify the size of their steaks!  This really frustrates me because personally I am good with a 6oz but my husband can down a 36oz!  I am just saying it would be nice to know.  Having said that, the New York was good, not like steak house good, even thought the price at $33 was unwarranted it was only a 8 or 10oz, I don't know to this day, don't care to find out, won't be going back.

Poor little girls that work there, obviously getting constantly hit on, clothing requirements potentially to blame, and say hello to bunion-ville in about 5 years, you will be so sorry you gave up comfort for fashion.  Trust me I know!  Our waitress was this bubbly little thing who was as cute as can be, we tipped her well and told her the the food sucking wasn't her fault, and considering how busy it was she did a fantastic job.

Over priced, under-seasoned, and too loud and bar like, not my cup of tea, prefer Earls much more, even though they are sister companies, I find Earls a tad classier.

Skip Joey's, his brother Earl is much better."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but I always feel Joey's is too \"blah\" and then when I'm there (usually for work lunch as its 1 second away), I remember I REALLY LIKE JOEY'S!!!

Yes, it's right by my work on Barlow so I am there 1-2 times per month (for the last seven years). I really don't have anything to complain about. The service starts great and continues to be great each and every time. Someone opens the door, a hostess in giant heels greets you quickly and seats you and they always ask how my day is going ... It's like a first date to be honest. Once seated we usually have drinks ordered immediately, and then they give enough time to read the menu and ask if we need help, etc. 

I have always liked their food more than a couple other \"mid-scale\" type places similar to ol' Joes. They have a great mix of appies, soups and salads as starts. The large salads are very large and filling, with interesting ingredients! The flatbreads are fantastic (try the tandoori for sure-it's a fav or mine), they have great steaks, AMAZING burgers (tallll onesss), and for a non-Indian restaurant - the butter chicken is pretty deadly as is the panang curry dish (it's actually funny how many people I know love their butter chicken). Oh yea, the skinny fries are ridiculously good. I have never had a bad thing here if memory serves and I have eaten most of the menu!

Desserts are great (loved the fondue when they had it and the lava cake is to die for (aren't they all?). Also to note is a great wine selection and great beers on tap as well (kronenbourg blanc - yes please!). So overall, I really do like Joey's after all. Pricing is decent and the quality is high...so I shall continue my 1-2 times per month visit!"}
{"text":"i love their blackened basa....it used to be good. i was just there and their portions have dropped drastically smaller while price is higher. if you havent been there, tell them and you get free appetizer...mine was ahi tuna tacos. really good. i dont know if they still do that though."}
