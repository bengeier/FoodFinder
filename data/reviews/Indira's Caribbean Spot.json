{"text":"I usually do not do reviews but I'm making a point to review this place because I love it. This is hands down the best Caribbean restaurant I've tried so far in Toronto. It looks a little run down, but it's endearing. I usually get their roti meals and they're AWESOME. The rotis are soft and moist and the spices and flavours are perfect. I've tried many rotis and this is by far the best I've ever had. Staff is super friendly too. Seriously worth a try."}
{"text":"Loved the Guyanese style jerk chicken. Lots of sauce, yum. If you like jerk chicken, but feel the hunger for something a little different?.... Go for it."}
{"text":"Im a chef and when people ask where do you eat? this is always the first place i mention. The building is old and not great looking but the food is seriously legit. The goat roti, doubles and jerk chicken have a depth and layer of flavours not matched my other more successful establishments near by. This is a real must try!"}
{"text":"Indira`s is a cute and cozy yet run-down little place that serves Guyanese food.  I was a little disappointed that they didn`t have any duck curry on hand the day I went but I got the goat curry with rice and peas instead and I didn`t regret it.  It was hands down the best goat curry I`ve ever tasted.  Not only was it beautifully spiced and seasoned but it was the most soft and tender goat meat I`ve ever had the pleasure of eating.  I hope Indira`s sticks around for a long long time as I definitely intend to come back to eat more of their curries.  It also helps that the servers were very customer friendly.  This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Had missed the hours of this place a few times but finally made it. Got the fam chicken curry and roti. I'm super critical of curry as nobody beats my grandmother's and I have to say this place was darn good. They gave us a really nice portion. 2 people can easily split one, but where's the \"mama's cooking\" in that? The chicken was moist, potatoes were firm but cooked, the sauce was a good thickness and the \"spicy\" you look for was built in. You may or may not need the hot sauce on the side depending on your tolerance.   If you are in the area or don't want to drive all the way to roti hut, you won't be disappointed. Well done! My granny would be proud."}
{"text":"It was a year ago now that I visited. Maybe the takeout is a different experience then dining in. Atmosphere 4/5 Service 5/5 Food 3/5 Price 4/5 I would have rather the doubles not been microwaved. They were stuck to the wrapping and I couldn't peel the wrapping off of some parts so a lot got wasted. Roti skins and curry was decent. Don't know that I'd go back tho."}
{"text":"We've done takeout here for Friday lunches multiple times.   We all agree, this place probably has the best jerk in the city.  The chicken is moist and flavourful, rice and beans are great.  And the coleslaw... man, it's just so good.  In our office, there are people who normally avoid Caribbean food that would ask for Indira's jerk chicken for lunch.   A coworker who is married to a Guyanese says this place is as legit as his mother in law's food.  (The chef tells us her stuff is better, which is part of what makes this place great.)  This is place is a hole in the wall but as I've learned in my travels, you can't let that stop you if you really love good food."}
{"text":"Had the goat curry with rice.  Recommended by the chef. She was very kind. It's a small place. Not that clean and very affordable prices. I would definitely go back.   I heard the doubles are fantastic there but unfortunately did not try them. My buddy tried the duck curry and he was blown away. Minus the bones!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, made with authentic Guyanese recipes. Be warned, your Roti's will be much more spicy than advertised, so if you don't like spice, best to ask for no hot sauce added!  My only criticism is that if you attempt to order delivery from them, it will be more stress than it is worth. They are disorganized, pass the phone between staff and ask for your address and order multiple times. Very friendly staff though."}
{"text":"This place sucks.   I've attempted to go to this place three times.  Each time it wasn't open.  The sign says they open at 11:30am.  Well, I was there around noon on one occasion, around 12:30pm on another and around 3:00pm on my third try.   To clarify I didn't try going all three times on the same day.   It was on three separate days.   Each time the door was closed and the lights were off.   Is this place still in business?? If they keep their doors closed past the time when they're supposed to be open it won't be long before they are out of business !!!"}
{"text":"I was curious how Guyanese food tastes so I popped in after walking by. I tried the boneless chicken curry lunch special for $5 without drink. It comes with rice and peas as well. It's the best curry I've had in town.   I came in the next day and had her jerk chicken lunch special for $5. It was a bit spicy, moist and crispy. Even comes with coleslaw. Everything was fresh and tasty.    Only bad things are the old space and not having everything on menu."}
{"text":"3.5... The food is plentiful, has that homestyle flavor and feel. Unfortunately, only cash (no debit/credit).  Interior is dumpy looking, plus no AC (hot in summer)."}
{"text":"We were heading to the beach on a Wednesday afternoon, when we had a craving for Jerk Chicken. Of course the first thing I do is pull out my Yelp app, and came across Indira's Carribean Spot. Parking is a pain on the Danforth, so of course parked illegally, I ran in quickly to grab 2 jerk chicken meals and a double for my friend and I. For some reason, this took 20 minutes to prepare, was it worth it? Definitely! (If I got a parking ticket, probably not). The jerk chicken had a nice kick to it and loaded with flavour. It was nicely complemented with rice and peas. I've had better doubles in Scarborough though and this one was much sweeter than most. I would definitely come back and try their rotis and other items!"}
{"text":"So delicious! We got delivery and ordered an ital roti which was HUGE and easily served two people, roasted chickpea snacks, polourie, potato balls and doubles. Everything was super tasty, flavourful and perfected spiced.  Will definitely order / eat there again!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today after doing some Christmas shopping and dodging icicles on the Danforth.  The lady who served me (and prepared the food) seemed to be the daughter of the owner.  She was very friendly and welcoming.  Loved the eclectic decor inside, it feels like someone's basement, complete with the bar on the window side of the restaurant.  Very cozy.  They have what appears to be a pretty huge sound system, so I'm guessing they throw parties or play tunes in the evenings.  As I'm a vegan I had a roti from their Ital menu with pumpkin, spinach and potato along with Soursop juice which I love, and is not so easy to find usually.  The roti was a good size and well spiced, just what I was looking for, and at $10 for everything, a really great value! Would definitely eat here again next time I'm in the east end."}
