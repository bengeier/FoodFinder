{"text":"I've been to mexigrill a few times and have had a variety of there food offerings and i must say that they are pretty consistent with their food offerings  The parking is easily accessible. The restaurant is clean and staff is bilingual and friendly"}
{"text":"I mean I love Chipotle, but I am not trying to drive to Ottawa or cross the boarder for a Burrito!  This is coming from someone who never had a bad experience at Chipotle. Having seen this place I decided to test my luck. I was very disappointed. Cons :  1st lack of freshness, 2nd lack of flavor. 3rd my chips were stale.  Pros: huge burritos, clean spot, parking available, friendly staff  .   To revive my burrito i tried to add as much hot sauce as I could,but ehh no luck. The place has potential, and I might go try it 1 more time just in case that my visit was just a bad one and they were maybe down on their game. I will definitely keep you guys updated!  On the up side they do have various weekly specials."}
{"text":"Passable imitation of Chipotle. The size of the burrito is smaller but they have similar options. Surprisingly including barbacoa and carnitas. You wouldn't expect this in French Canada where they rejected the very generic Taco Bell.  The taste of my vegetarian burrito was fine although I felt that the tortilla was somewhat stale. The staff was friendly and spoke English and French interchangeably."}
{"text":"C'est le meilleur mexicain à.laval.  point.  Les burritos sont délicieux et c'est très abordable."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican option that runs a lot like Chipotle or Subways. Choose your meal type such as a burrito or taco and garnish it with the meats and ingredients you crave.  The prep work was good and service was friendly. I went with a beef burrito with guacamole and it was stuffed! Thick!!! As side orders, I went with their Churros.  Overall it was pretty good for fast food, nothing to rave about but fills the stomach for about $8.  3.5 rounded down, will be back again and check out other options."}
{"text":"The service is now friendly and the food is pretty good. It's a mexican fast food so don't exoect high gastronomy but very satisfying none the less."}
{"text":"would give this place more of a 3.5 then a 4 but I can't. They serve better fast food then most places around this area, if you feel like have a Mexican meal that's above average then defiantly stop by MexiGrill. The owner is really nice and he will fill up your burrito or taco with lots of meat or veggies."}
