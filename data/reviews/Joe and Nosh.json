{"text":"I really was excited to have a new breakfast option, especially one that served it all day.  Alas I will be unlikely to choose to eat a hot breakfast there again after being served over-medium eggs and country ham on a piece of paper with flimsy plastic utensils;  this is just not reasonable to expect one to enjoy untangling egg yolks  and ham from torn and shredded paper to finally make its way to your mouth."}
{"text":"Not sure if only temporary, but they have 2 new items on the menu: chicken strip basket, and burger. I tried the chicken strip basket and it was a deal for area lunch options ($9). Included with the price was either fries or sweet potato tots. The tots were really good. Chicken strips were good and something that would seemingly be consistent each time. Next time I will try the burger."}
{"text":"As others have said, I had a lot of expectations for this new spot (even after being disappointed at Pack House).  For a new, local spot, I am dumbfounded that there is not a gluten-free bread offering? I am dumbfounded as I visited a breakfast spot in Fairview, NC outside of Asheville that LITERALLY is connected to a gas station that offers gluten free bread. I ended up ordering some eggs with a side of fruit, which were nothing more than previously-frozen mixed berries (ultimately I know they are cutting corners as I am sure they use frozen berries for their smoothies--which is fine...for smoothies) but don't offer mediocre fruit as a side that is mushy and still so cold.  The coffee is fine. One barista on a Saturday isn't enough though.  The decor is great, but service, food, and set-up wise I wish they would visit other similar concepts (like Community Canteen up in Virginia or Earls in Elizabeth)."}
{"text":"this place looks attractive from the street, but that's about it. food - tiny. I left hungry after a sandwich that was called a panini. coffee...what the heck was that in my cup!???? My friend's bagel egg sandwich was COLD!!! Good grief...clueless servers, zero customer service. I won't say the \"m\" word but we all know who were the servers. I will not return."}
{"text":"This place has tons of potential: name, location, vision, ambience, and free parking.  I didn't think my breakfast, however, was memorable.  My eggs were cooked too quickly on a hard top; consequently, over-easy morphed into crispy over-medium.  The hefty biscuit was dry and crumbly.  Add all this on a cold aluminum plate covered in wax paper and I think their $12 breakfast (included coffee) has a plethora of more worthy competitors."}
{"text":"Love the coffee, love the atmosphere, and love the sandwiches. I would not recommend the desserts/pastries. They look good, but lack finesse in flavor."}
{"text":"Way overpriced.   I stopped to get a breakfast sandwich. It is on a normal sized plain bagel with egg, American cheese and ham. It was $8.39.   $8.39 for a breakfast sandwich? I didn't get coffee, I didn't get juice, I didn't get a side of fruit - nothing - just a bagel with egg, cheese and ham.   Really?"}
{"text":"Finally decided to stop by after my workout this morning! The layout and interior designing is very chic and relaxing. The menu isn't to overbearing and provides just enough options for any foodie. I bought a whole wheat turkey with cheddar and egg sandwich, and man oh man did that sucker fill me up. I wish there was an option for picking a spread ( maybe something like an aioli sauce) as the sandwich did feel like it was missing something.   As far as beverages go, I picked the spiced dirty chai with almond milk on ice. They mix it with cold brew which gave it a nice kick, but I do wish they shook it up a little more as there was some spices that didn't quite mix well yet when I took the first sip.   Lastly I purchased the cinnamon bun. This thing was massive, beautifully iced, and looked delicious. But don't judge a book by its cover unfortunately. When I took the first bite all I could taste was dough. There was no flavor to it whatsoever in my opinion. If they would have brushed a little butter over it this bun would have a much better review but I was definitely disappointed in the taste."}
{"text":"It's too expensive! I work upstairs from Joe and Nosh so love the convenience, but just found out they don't do combos anymore. So, I paid $9 for a small hot ham and Swiss sandwich (with no drink or bag of chips). Don't get me wrong, the sandwich is good, but not for what they charge. I won't be visiting much in the future after this."}
{"text":"My dad always told me you get what you pay for.........  It may be a little bit more expensive, but the food is great.  The nitro cold brew is the best I've had in CLT.  I've had the croissant breakfast sandwich and breakfast platter.  My debit card is going to keep saying \"Joe & Nosh\" for awhile!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! We shared a sausage, egg and cheese croissant which was perfect for 2. Their lattes have great flavor too. Easy parking. New favorite coffee spot!"}
{"text":"Good food but seriously?   Good food but portion is nothing but pathetic. I ordered a sandwich which cost me almost 10 bucks--and this is what I got: a one-bite-sized sandwich...(see pic)  Look, I get that margin is important but this is just way too much. When I am buying a lunch, I expect it to be a lunch, NOT a snack.   Yes, less food might mean less cal intake for better health. But, I will be in a sh*ty mood when I am starving 2hrs after my lunch. I might not be a health expert, but I can tell that an empty stomach and crappy mood have no good to my health.  Bottom line: Yes, I will recommend this place if you think Whole Food (pre-amazon acquisition) is underpriced."}
{"text":"Great spot to sit outside and enjoy a coffee or chilled drink. The red umbrellas are a great touch.   They had almond milk and soy along with delicious veggie options. Great service! Patient waitstaff and fast too!  I would definitely suggest the restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't strike you as a ' rise and shine ' person, do I ?!! My friend and I went on Saturday morning to Joe and Nosh, and we grabbed some coffee and few chocolate croissants on the way to the Belk College Kickoff Game FanFest.  Joe and Nosh is only a couple blocks away from where I live which might give me the chance to go there more often.   Good coffee. Good croissant. Good service. Will be coming back.  Four Yelps."}
{"text":"Bad. Just bad. The food was inedible.   Upside: the staff was nice and there's a good view of Uptown."}
{"text":"First, whatever you get round up the bill to benefit their charity, Behailu Academy.   I try to only eat breakfast out one weekday a week and was anxious to try this place out since I drive by it every day. Easy to park and get out so that was a bonus. Loved the interior and it wasn't super busy. Ordered a Bacon Egg and Cheese on Brioche bread and a large coffee. The coffee was super hot. The large is probably a Grande, maybe 16oz. High quality beans, not bitter. The sandwich I took to the office and the bread was amazing. Very light and buttery. Eggs and everything perfectly cooked. After taxes and I round this up it was $10. That is the only complaint you can have about this place is the value. Quality is without question and if you are willing to pay for that, this place will deliver."}
{"text":"I REALLY, REALLY want to love this place. The interior is trendy and beautiful. Very simple and minimal, which I love. Every employee who we encountered was super friendly and nice. Parking was also super easy (there's a deck attached to the building). I also love that it's a small business.   We ordered a cold brew coffee with almond milk, a bottled orange juice, a twisted club and a chicken kale caesar wrap with romaine instead of kale. No chips or sides or desserts. Our bill totaled $28. In my opinion, it was super overpriced (especially considering the art on the wall that states \"reasonably priced\").   My fiancé really enjoyed his club sandwich. I thought the cold brew coffee was really strong and it  initially didn't come with ice, which I found kinda weird, although I think this is how this particular type of coffee is served. I went back up to the counter and asked for them to add ice and vanilla to it, which they happily did. My wrap had great flavor but the quality of the chicken left much to be desired. I typically opt for seafood instead of meat so I am already iffy about chicken but was super disappointed to find a hard piece of cartlidge and then a small piece of bone in my chicken. I ended up dumping out the chicken and eating the wrap with just lettuce.   Despite my high hopes, I didn't love this spot. My fiancé and I both agree that we wouldn't go out of our way to come back here. He did really like his club and said that he would order it again, despite the high price tag."}
{"text":"Their coffee is to die for!  They have a cute front patio with rocking chairs that faces the road.  Heads up...it's not covered so this is not the place to go if it rains and you want to sit outside.  Cute addition to the neighborhood and great if you're stopping by when out walking the dogs.  Dog-friendly patio so bring the fur babies!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant group and their concepts.  It is perfect for the area.  A place I could grab breakfast on my way into work or have a breakfast meeting and not leave feeling all sticky.  It hits the marks on those points.  I wish it had more already designed breakfast sandwich choices (the sandwiches are all create your own and the choices for the sandwiches are all a la carte).  I had a wrap with egg whites, ham and cheese and a large regular coffee and it was $10.50.  Albeit the wrap was delicious $10.50 just seems a little steep for a quick weekday breakfast."}
{"text":"Gender neutral restrooms, gross. At least one should be designated as Women only. The food is bland, plain, a lot of super processed condiments. And think I see people cleaning off their own tables? I don't work here. No."}
{"text":"I've been coming here a lot lately for work meetings. The coffee is good. The food is good. They accommodate my plant-based diet with two vegan(ish) options on the menu! The space is small and very busy around noon, but there is ample seating! The parking is free and convenient I had the hummus wrap (no cheese). It was typical, you can't ask for much out of a hummus wrap!  The space is what income for, and the coffee of course!!"}
{"text":"My fiance is obsessed with a good breakfast sandy and one night scrolling through insta he shakes a photo of Joe and Nosh in my face and says, \"Baaaaabbbbe, we have to gooooo.\" Finally, we made the pilgrimage to Joe and Nosh and it lived up to the highly anticipated expectation!  What makes coffee shops so intriguing? Is it the different roasts? Makes people watching fancier, only because you have a cup of joe in your hand? Well, Joe and Nosh is all of the above and more! Their breakfast sandwiches are on point! Their biscuits are buttery and flaky, paired with eggs and a protein makes it one of the best breakfast sandwiches in Charlotte.  Fairly priced for the create your own option, but even not getting a meat added it was on the pricy side.   My one complaint is that the nitro coffee was more than my breakfast sandy. That is outragous. Words to the wise, find that somewhere else.   The atmosphere was great and compared to other similar coffee shops, Joe and Nosh is superior. Their seating is great and with the rocking chairs outside, makes you feel like you're in the country, sipping on your Joe and Noshing on a sandwich. For the cold days, they have heat lamps and you can bring your dog if you're sitting outside.  Overall a win-win."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast or lunch! Clean and friendly staff. Plenty of healthy options. Food is great and Fidel is such a gracious host!"}
{"text":"Okay stop for coffee--they have a lot of options, and the quality of drinks is good. The menu is really overpriced.   The space is cool, I really like the outdoor seating facing Morehead to people watch. The staff was nice as well. If I'm in the area and need a coffee I will stop, but I would never go out of my way for Joe and Nosh. Nothing remarkable to write about."}
{"text":"Great location and great service. I love how well lit the coffee shop is and how open. I do dislike that there is no menu. As a newcomer the first they opened I had no idea they had food or treats. The staff also didn't really notify or seem to \"sell\" me since I was new and didn't know what they had  if that makes sense. I'll definitely be back though :)"}
{"text":"I constantly pass this place going up and down Moorehead, but never stopped in (with the exception of that one time where I was cheering for the Charlotte Marathon and I used their bathroom).  Finally made it one weekday morning to try out their breakfast offerings.    Did a custom breakfast sammy : croissant, sausage, egg, and provolone cheese.  Decent and I got to eat it while staring at the Charlotte skyline.  I'll come back to try their coffee, but it was a Tuesday morning and not so busy... there were a good amount of people there... reading papers, working, or meeting up with people.  The staff was nice and they have a beautiful space to work in.  Coffeehouse with a stark black and white color motif is definitely unique.  I know a lot of the coffee spots have been leaning toward the industrial look/feel, but this place goes a bit further with the super white walls and modern decor.  Parking deck makes it easy to park... in and out.  Did not see a lot of people walking here from the neighborhood, but it can definitely be a neighborhood place since it's on the edge of Dilworth and next to the YMCA.  Maybe when the YMCA construction is complete this place will get more visitors/traffic... but judging by the \"NO YMCA Parking\" sign in the deck, they've already run into their share of issues."}
