{"text":"I expected crawfish!!!! no Crawfish till after 3pm! The food WAS good and so was the service. I asked \"what dishes do you have with crawfish?\"  None, was the answer.  I'm sorry...what's the name of this place again?"}
{"text":"Food is great! And fresh! Try the pork and shrimp vermicelli. The crawfish is very tasty. Nice environment."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I haven't talked to a single person that had a good experience. I went there and they were out of crawfish at 8pm on a Friday. I opted for a sandwich, my date had a noodle bowl. The waitress came back to the table with only fries. Minutes later she brought just the sandwich. Then she finally brought the noodle bowl. The sandwich looked nothing like the picture. I asked the waitress why, and she responded that they get the pictures of their food from Google images. So be weary of what you order because it won't look like the picture. Lastly I was all but done with my meal by the time my appetizer showed up. I wish I could give the place zero stars."}
{"text":"Bomb pho and crawfish!! I don't care if it's a Vietnamese restaurant and I don't care what the name is, the food was good and I wish we have a crawfish/pho joint like this in Seattle !"}
{"text":"Not at all what I expected. LA Boiled Crawfish? I was expecting Cajun or creole, not Vietnamese.Very limited menu and an overpowering smell of mint when I was there. The stir fry was good, but I don't see this lasting any longer than any of the other three restaurants that have been in this location."}
{"text":"Had a great experience.  The wait staff was very attentive and courteous.  We had the Pho and Cajun crawfish. it was all excellent!  We were completely satiated and happy. We will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"I too had dreams of hurricanes and gumbo when I saw this place about to open. I was also surprised about the menu....but I got over it.  The food is actually very good . The Banh mi sandwiches are excellent, as is the Pho  Change your name or ,don't change it, no matter Ill keep going"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to check out this new crawfish place and like many other reviews , my anticipation of the restaurant was slightly off! It is not the fancy Cajun Queen setting and it is a Vietnamese place! The menu is different and thanks to my college who knows Vietnamese food in detail I had an open mind! We ordered the crawfish Cajun style, with sausage, and in addition the vermicelli pork dish . The crawfish Cajun style ,we shared as appetizer at reasonable market prize like 6.00 per lb)was excellent , And the  very large bowl vermicelli pork with rolls was very tasty , flavored by the homemade sauce/dressing and we both enjoyed it as a very authentic Vietnamese meal! The pricing for lunch was surprisingly inexpensive and I will add it to one of my favorite , alternate restaurant with friends, colleagues and clients! The service was attentive and pleasant ! 4 stars for me!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in town.  Huge portion with tons of noodles and meat.  The name is confusing but well worth the trip to the Steele Creek area!"}
{"text":"Had crawfish and it was fantastic.  Then tried the crab legs and were some of the best i have ever had along with their garlic butter.  I will be back again this week as i am here on travel.  Cant wqit to try their pho next!"}
{"text":"Soo excited to have a crawfish in charlotte since Flamin crawfish closed down. Here's the down hill..  First, I sat down looking at the menu like WTF.  Flipping the menu back and forth to make sure I'm at the right restaurant. Uhhh Vetnamese???  If I wanted Vietnamese food I would of went next door to pho cali. Anyway, after looking at the menu, debating if we should get the crawfish cause it was frozen. We ask the table next to us eating crawfish if the crawfish are good and they said not really so we got up and carry out 2 banh mi. My friend Jen heard pho cali recently added seafood menu so we went there and check it out instead. Overall, menu looks weird. This place is confusing. I hope the owner is reading all this and make some changes and I might give it another try."}
{"text":"Went in last week with my husband and absolutely loved the food. Really cool concept. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I think this place is a bit mislabeled by Yelp - this is definitely more of a Vietnamese place. Vouched by my Vietnamese coworker, it's become the go-to place when I seriously crave for pho and Bah Mi. No doubt that they have the best bah mi in Charlotte - the grilled chicken is always juicy and tender, the bun is always crispy and the veggies are always fresh with the spot-on jalapeño and cilantro."}
{"text":"So happy to find an excellent Banh Mi sandwich in Charlotte and not too far away from Ballantyne.  The broth in the pho was amazing.  Also nice to get crawfish in july.  We've found a new \"go to\" restaurant."}
{"text":"I understand how the name can be confusing for some people. However, I don't think it's fair to give a restaurant a rating of one or two on here just based on their name. It's not fair especially if this system of rating is based on quality of food, service and the atmosphere.   Yes, it's a Vietnamese restaurant and being a Vietnamese, I quite enjoy the food. The pho broth is good. From the first taste, I knew they took their time to cook it right using bones and that was much appreciated. The banh mi was also pretty good. A little bit small, however quite tasty.   Overall, to be honest, I was just glad that there's now a good Vietnamese restaurant in this area (compared to Pho Cali - no offense but this is really where you guys should give the 1 star rating to being the right name and all)"}
{"text":"I didn't come with expectations, but if I did, they would have been met.   When I walked in, the first thing I noticed was the quiet atmosphere. It's a quaint place; relaxed and free of any excessive energy, which was nice to be honest. I was greeted and given a table, a menu, and a good impression of what the waiters are like.   Sweet, and very pretty.   They seem to know their customers well, and I've often seen them even sit down with their customers to have a chat.   So I decided to spread out my options and get Pho, Banh Mi, and Hu Tieu Xao w/ Tofu. Sounds like a lot, but well worth it.   Pho came out first, and I savored every drop of heavenly goodness. The broth was well done. Noodles well cooked and tender. And the portioning? Plenty.   Then it was the Hu Tieu Xao, and man was it good. I wasn't too stoked at first ( I'm not the biggest fan of tofu ), but once I tried it, I was sold. The tofu was crisp on the outside, soft and hot on the inside. It was a wonderful combination of fresh veggies and thick cut rice noodles. It was bootiful. Simply bootiful.   And finally, those damn Banh Mi sandwiches.I should have gotten 20 of 'em, maybe 25. They were good, real good. Warm and crispy baguette, flavorful meat, and crunchy veggies, all together in harmony with each other. Blast of flavaaa. Mm. Mmm. Mmmmhmmmm.   Give it a shot. Come with no expectations, leave with smiles and full tummies."}
{"text":"I have been super excited about this place ever since I found out it was Vietnamese and not Cajun/seafood only. I'm not a big cajun fan nor do I like crawfish, however I love Vietnamese food as a whole. So I went and got take out from here the other night. I've been dying to try their Ban Mi sandwiches since some people at work said they were good. So I got a Chicken Ban Mi and some fries. The sandwich was okay but I really didn't think it was great, and the fries were soggy and super salty. I also felt like I got pork and not chicken, I could be wrong on that but the consistencies are different and it didn't taste or feel like chicken. The staff was very nice, but overall I got the feeling they've never done this before. I will give them some time to get their operation balanced out and give them a try again however for now I have to give them a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"We came here to try something new and it's close to the house. We normally go to Doans for Pho and after seeing reviews of this place we didn't get the crawfish. Instead we ordered the pho and banh mi. My husband and I both liked it! You get ALOT of food along with noodles and meat. I ordered the regular bowl and I couldn't finish it. I usually order the large bowl at Doans. The Banh Mi was also good! The jalapeños were spicier than I'm use to very good. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Just go to this place.  Order some Pho and Banh mi and be happy.  Yes the seafood is good but the Vietnamese staples are amazing.  The Pho broth could be a little richer but the best you'll find this side of town.  The Banh mi is really very good.  If you haven't tried Banh Mi before it is a Vietnamese pork sandwich.  Get the pork pate on it, don't be scared, it's awesome!  Just moved here from Cotswald area and this place will be a weekly stop.  Eat here, to lose a place like this would be a shame."}
{"text":"The pork Bahn-Mi sandwich is the best I've tasted.  The pork they use reminds me of Korean BBQ pork but not spicy.  Kudos for going this route rather than stuffing it with smoked pork with pink dye.  The veggies in the sandwich was fresh and well balanced.  Bravo on this sandwich!    Unfortunately the other items we had, such as the crab and crawfish were neither fresh nor flavorful.  The recently closed down Flamin' Crawfish place had amazing flavors.  The selfish flavors here tasted like someone just poured store bought seafood seasoning.  Also the quality of the selfish was suspect.    We'll go back for the sandwich for sure but the other items were a let down. They do have Pho also so I'll have taste that next time.  Update 8-18-2015  Upgraded to 3 Star because the Bahn-Mi sandwich (B4) is the best on the planet.  I'm serious.  Everything else is mediocre at best but the pork Bahn-Mi is spectacular.  I've had similar versions in NYC, MD, VA, GA, all over California and three places in Charlotte.  Item B4 of the menu is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Read the reviews first, so I knew it was a Viet place. Vietnamese is my favorite so of course I had to try. Chicken Banh Mi and pho were great. Sadly, I live in Steele Creek. There are never any good restaurants here, just a bunch of chains. I always eat in other neighborhoods (university, myers park, etc) but this place, WOW! So good! Broth is so delicious, really comparable to Pho Real's. Really authentic and delicious. Service is nice too. I hope this business does well. I will return to get my fix of popular Viet food when I'm craving it since it's so close to home! I wish they served shrimp the sane style they serve crawfish. That would be the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"We went to try out this new restaurant in town... I have been looking forward to some good crawfish but I have to say.. I am disappointed with their crawfish....we ordered Cajun crawfish but the seasoning was very weak... The pho was ok... Just keep in mind this is a Vietnamese restaurant that serves crawfish and not an authentic Louisiana style restaurant. The service was very slow...."}
{"text":"Loved the bahn mi, been searching for a place with bahn mi for awhile and I have found it!!! Bun thit was also very good"}
{"text":"I think they have the best Pho in Charlotte! It's flavorful and they give you plenty! My go to restaurant when I want a hot bowl of Pho during a rainy day. Depending on my mood, I do like to order their crawfish when it's in season and it's pretty decent. Although, it's the dry version to the typical saucy type of crawfish seasoning I would like. If it's not in season, they serve you frozen kind and they're aren't that good.   The name of the restaurant is kind of deceiving because it's actually a Vietnamese restaurant with  only one or two seafood items. Not really sure what they were thinking when they opened this place with this name ...but it sure confused the heck out of customers!  Otherwise, try their Pho! You can't go wrong with it. :)"}
{"text":"Looking for Louisiana food and was shocked as everyone else was prices were up there for moderate food. The flavors were good the staff apologetic from the get go for not being Cajun food. Honestly think they need to put a sign out for Vietnamese"}
{"text":"Out of all the pho places I have been to, I must say that this place gives the most meat and noodles which is great! Other places are stingy. Their banh mi is also really good. Again they give a lot of meat! So if you want to be full off your meals, I would suggest coming here. The menu is a bit weird but I can't complain. The restaurant is a bit out of place because the murals are not about Vietnam. The booth cushions are pretty flat as well. And the name of the restaurant is a bit misleading because I thought this place was completely a crawfish place. The employees are nice as well! This one girl checks up on us a lot though."}
{"text":"The worst....service...ever Just really rude.  Went there today around 11:15, ordered sweet tea they brought unsweet tea, said they had to make some sweet tea.  Ordered the garlic butter crawfish, which they brought in a tin pan with a bowl with gloves like you use for hair color or treatments, very messy, still no drink, had to ask for water, they acted like I was bothering them the whole time, I was the only one in the restaurant...Brought my tea, the crawfish, which had no flavor were so messy I asked for extra napkins, they brought two, when I got through eating, I asked for a wet paper towel, couldn't even open my purse, this sauce was everywhere just trying to get them open...they said they did not have a towel?  Asked again for a wet paper towel, had to ask 4 times, finally got a semi-wet small paper towel, so I used the napkins and wet them with water from my glass.  Was thoroughly disgusted by that point, the waitress had brought the bill, asked for the manager, he came out, tried to tell him what had happened, he said they didn't have towels...said he did not what was going on with the waitresses since he was in the back cooking and they were new...told him they needed to be trained.  Had to ASK for my change which was over $8.00, guess they thought it was a tip for the horrible service???  This restaurant will go the way of everything else that has been on this corner, and close soon...a friend had told me she was there a few weeks ago and it wasn't good, should have paid attention..."}
{"text":"The main reason we decided to stop by was because our usual crawfish joint, Flamin' Crawfish, was recently permanently closed in June. Spotted this place and thought to give it a try. Just like Flamin' Crawfish, LA Crawfish is mainly Vietnamese. We ordered a bowl of pho ga (chicken soup), 2lbs of crawfish, an order of clams and a banh mi.   Pho and banh mi are yummy. I would definitely come back for those particular dishes if I'm on that side of town. As for the crawfish, we had the Cajun seasoning and it was so dry and bland. They didn't seem fresh like Flamin' Crawfish. The options to add corn or sausages is overpriced. $1 for each piece compared to $.50. The clams were over cooked. They were super chewy. I anticipated small clams but these were large. Just a side note if anyone is interested in them.   Drink options are the usual sodas or tea. Nothing special like bubble teas or fruit teas.   So, do I recommend this place? For pho, vermicelli or banh mi, I would definitely say \"Stop by if you're near!\" For crawfish, no. The Chinese buffet probably has better ones."}
{"text":"As other Yelpers have mentioned - this is a Vietnamese restaurant. We were also expecting Cajun food while this place was in progress and were surprised by the menu when we came in. Unfortunately we did not stay for our first visit since they were out of the bread to make their bahn mi, and weren't serving seafood until after 3:00pm. Since we were expecting Cajun and weren't in the mood for pho we left to return at a later date. They did serve us seafood on our return lunch visit so I believe they have wisely changed that policy.   Our first actual visit was this weekend and in general we were impressed with the food and service. The establishment was clean and the waitress was attentive. We started by splitting a pound of snow crab which came out super fresh and delicious. The crab legs came with an interesting spicy dipping sauce which was good to sample but I think I will order lemon butter in the future. I guess I am a bit of a traditionalist there.  We each had one bahn mi for our main and they were delicious - and spicy! I opened my sandwich about half way through to find thinly sliced fresh jalapeño. This was my first bahn mi experience so I am not sure if it is supposed to be that spicy, but I ended up taking out two of the slices. The banh mi are only $4.50 which is a bargain for lunch so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came in, was seated and then never spoke to again. Waited 10-15 minutes (no one had spoke to us), flagged down a waitress, and asked to be helped. About 5 mins later she came back, we gave our drink and food order. And about 10 more minutes later we still had no drink (that's 25-30 mins...) so we just got up and left, walked by the same waitress, she looked right at me and didn't say a thing. Horrible service. There are SO many option right beside this place, do yourself a favor and choose ANY of them. Also as you probably know, this is not Louisiana style food, so I have no idea what the LA stands for."}
{"text":"Regardless of the name, if you like Vietnamese.. try this restaurant for lunch.. you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Interesting place here - they are tucked away in a little courtyard that almost makes them a challenge to find - good thing they have a sign out front or you probably wouldn't know that they are there at all.  Once inside, it looks like they are a cajun seafood (clam, crab, crawfish, etc) joint, but once you sit down, they turn into a Vietnamese place - the menu has banh mi, bun, pho and other choices. Definitely right up my alley.  We ordered some snow crab legs and crawfish, as well as a banh mi to go with it. Not long after, the crab came out, followed by a nice-sized bag of crawfish, and finally the banh mi. Though we asked for the garlic butter, and it looked like there was garlic in it, it was really more of a cajun garlic, not that there is anything wrong with that. Just realize it has a bit of a kick to it, so if you don't want it, ask for regular butter instead.  The crawfish were tasty, and a few of them even produced a bit of goodies when you sucked the head - though most were dry you could still get a good taste of the spices used. Make sure you ask for extra wet naps, these babies are messy.  Once they were all gone, the banh mi made for a nice way to cool down the mouth, even with the sliced jalapeno on it. Must have been the bread. The pork was some of the tastiest I've had, though the slices were a little large and they ended up pulling out of the rest of the sandwich - a little smaller slices or being a bit more tender would have worked better!"}
{"text":"I don't like to write bad reviews but this warrants one.  First off, this place will not survive unless they change one of two things: 1. The menu 2. The name of the business  I'm not sure what they are trying to achieve here. Are they trying to capitalize on the wave of boiled seafood in a bag like the ones in southern California (The Boiling Crab franchise)? Or they are trying to go for the Louisiana crawfish boil? Either one, it's a big FAIL. I grew in Southern California and went to college in New Orleans. I know what they should taste like.   When they are playing on words with \"LA Boiled Crawfish\", it is expected to have crawfish all day long. Not after 3pm. And what does LA stand for? Los Angeles? Or Louisiana?   Lastly, this is a Vietnamese restaurant. It doesn't matter who the owner is, or who the cooks are. But the food that you serve needs to reflect that of your store name. Imagine going to a restaurant called NY Pizza but you can't order any Pizza's till after 3pm, there's only 2 types of pizzas served. But meanwhile, you can have mexican food. Does that even make any sense? No.   Establishment is clean, new decor. Staff is friendly but I don't know how good the service is because I didn't dine in. I ordered a sandwich and took it to go.   I'd much rather this place was upfront and honest and named it LA Pho. Because after crawfish season is over, it's just another Vietnamese restaurant who will have a bad ratings because diners were expecting one thing and got something else.   * I hope the owners are reading this *"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have tried several dishes and their food is consistently good. Their chicken and pork banh mi is amazeballs! Try it if you haven't, you won't be let down. Only reason for a 4 star is because i haven't tried their crawfish and etc that they serve there. I'll be back to try it though and complete an updated review :)"}
{"text":"I haven't tried any of their food yet. Especially the crawfish due to many negative reviews. But their banh mi is good! Even tho I got the banh mi dac biet and didn't get any cha lua (pork roll slices). Maybe it doesn't come with it? I thought it usually does. Idk but I'll ask next time to make sure."}
{"text":"Just dont do it! Go to the flaming crawfish if you want good seasoned seafood! How is shrimp not one of the seafood options on your menu?? Shut it down!!"}
{"text":"Will definitely be back! First time and loved it! Shrimp noodle stir fry was awesome as well as the crablegs! Blue moon was 2.50!"}
{"text":"Excellent surprise that it was a Vietnamese place. The bahn mi was awesome! Going back soon for seafood. Service was awesome, place was clean!"}
{"text":"I was glad to read reviews on Yelp as we were headed to MAI but saw this place was Vietnamese and thought oh let's try it Yummy!! Had Bahn Mi 2 the hubby had 1 and the parentals had shrimp stir fry we all started with summer rolls everything was fresh and delicious!!  Didn't try Pho so can't comment on it"}
{"text":"La Boiled Crawfish. It's complicated. They're closed and they're moving (two doors down) and they're reopening with a new name. I look forward to trying the new place as it's going to be a much clearer name that is less \"Huh?\" and more \"Vietnamese food!\"  I did stop by this afternoon after having read the reviews and wanting what I heard was great pho."}
{"text":"The food was yummy like best seafood I had before and the waiter was really nice only problem I had was the bathroom rest room burn my hand the temperature was up way to hot my hand still hurt as I write this message"}
{"text":"My rating and review for this restaurant is solely based on their banh mi/Vietnamese sandwiches. I got one order of B1 and B2. It took less than 10 minutes to make the sandwiches once my order was placed. Let me inform all you Yelpers out there that this restaurant makes one of the best banh mi in North Carolina, if not the best! The baguette was warm, crisp on the outside, and airy in the center. The fillings were perfectly seasoned and harmonized well the pickled carrots, daikon, cucumber, and cilantro. Amazing! I wish I had ordered all 5 types of banh mi they had available on their menu. Ugh... sooooo good! Can't wait to go back next time I'm in town. Folks, ignore the restaurant's name, leave all preconceived notions at the door, and give this restaurant a chance. If you order the Vietnamese sandwiches, I promise you won't regret it."}
