{"text":"I had pretty low expectations for this place given the previous Yelp reviews, but just wanted to give it a shot.   As everyone has said, the dishes are WAY overpriced for the amount of food you get. The $18 paella was laughable. It had one mussel in it and the paella itself took up only a quarter of the plate.   The ambiance is nice, but there was a random DJ in the corner and I'm pretty sure they played Miley Cyrus-Wrecking Ball at least twice, maybe thrice. Just an odd contrast to the restaurant itself.   The bill came to $200 for 4 of us and we left hungry :("}
{"text":"For the price it wasn't good. Mexican restaurants  shouldn't charge for tapas size guacamole and chips. The food needs to get more flavourful. The paella was disappointing more like a cheesy risotto and my friends and I were expecting something more authentic. The breads tasted stale. The decor was nice waitresses friendly but they need a really good bartender and better inventory management at the bar. The drinks were a bit watery. They didn't have stuff for one drink we ordered. I never got a glass of wine I ordered."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with a group of 10 people on a busy Saturday night. It's quite new and it really shows. At first we thought it was kind of cool that there were three levels of dinning space, despite having to walk up a decent amount of stairs. It quickly became apparent that our food and drinks would also have to make this epic journey and that nothing would appear within a reasonable time frame, including anyone resembling a waiter/waitress.  Before I get to the service, I will of course discuss the food. For an app I had the La Penosa, which is chicken, beef, and pork tinga, baked tostada, and black bean purée. I was pretty impressed with this -- great texture and flavour. For the main, I had the Angus beef tacos with poblano corn tortilla, pico de gallo,chorizo español and mozarella. I found it bland and uninspiring, and to top it all off, the portion sizes are TINY. The dish had potential, but it was definitely missing something.    Back to the service. When we arrived there was no one on the third floor, yet we were divided up into two tables. The tables were combined when we asked, but it seemed odd that they hadn't thought of this. After that it was all downhill: 30-40 minute waits for drinks, mixed up drink and food orders, etc. I only had two drinks because I wasn't sure a third would ever appear! Note to servers: more drinks = bigger bill = bigger tip. There's nothing worse than having to flag down a waiter just to get a beer at a Mexican restaurant. To top it all off, when we finished we waited the better part of an hour to get our bill.   So here's where a one-star review becomes two. The owner asked for feedback and we commented on the service. In general, most were happy with the food, so I'll mention that as well. He apologized profusely and bought us a round of tequila. He seemed like a very nice guy who wants to improve his business, so I'll stick with two stars, but I wouldn't be honest if I went any higher."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars because it has potential to be better, but there are some extremely obvious flaws that need to be worked out soon by management, otherwise this place is doomed to fail.  A place that is almost empty on New Year's Eve around 8pm for dinner is a bad sign, especially when the restaurant is in such a trendy location in a great building.  The service was just fine, and our servers were great, so I don't have any complaints here.  However, during our meal, a man who I think was the GM came up to us and sort of desperately asked if we were going to be staying longer for drinks.  It seemed like he was trying to get people to stay in the almost vacant restaurant - it was sort of sad.  The portion sizes were terrible.  I got a \"cup\" of the Azteca soup...which was a little bit of tomato soup covered in tortilla chips and globs of avocado cream. It seemed really difficult to eat with the chips on top, and the avocado cream was not well incorporated into the dish.  By the time I actually got down to the soup, there was barely half of a cup in total.  For my main dish, I ordered the stuffed poblano pepper (I requested vegetarian).  I was really surprised that there was not one vegetarian option on the main menu.  When it came, I was sorely disappointed at the portion size.  They replaced the meat with two slices of a potato, and there weren't any sides to go along with it.    So I left still really hungry.  I like tapas a lot - it's a great way to sample a few different dishes...but this place wasn't a tapas restaurant.  Its main dishes were tapas sized and entree priced.  If you want to know why you're failing, it's because your portion sizes are ridiculous and your food isn't good enough to make up for it.  I don't ever want to leave a restaurant still hungry and feeling like I've been taken for a ride."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend prior to seeing a play. When new restaurants open, there is typically a lot of hype and service and food are exceptional. I do think Ole Ole fell a little short in these areas. I really liked the atmosphere; the restaurant was dimly lit and had a modern feel to it with unique, spherical light fixtures.  The servers were friendly, but it took too long for the food to arrive and we had mentioned to our server that we were under time constraints. A couple was seated beside us and even though they arrived after us, their appetizers were served before ours were.   The dishes were plated very attractively. We had the El defeno, which is a fancy name for guacamole and chips, at $11. The guacamole was lacking either salt or lime juice. We also ordered the La Penosa, which was a fresh and crisp meat tostada accompanied with black bean puree. I did request Tabasco sauce and one of the servers brought me an empty bottle. Lucky for me, my tacos did come with hot sauce and different garnishes, which were all tasty. Two tacos were $14 and came with chicken and fresh toppings. As service was slow, we didn't have time (or room) for desserts."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Ole Ole, as I love this cuisine and the vibe is lively and fun.  But the critical reviews were right about the service - while everyone was clearly trying very hard, it took a very long time for dishes to arrive, our pre-dinner cocktails arrived five minutes apart, and it was 1.5 hours from sitting down to getting our entrees, despite the fact that we had ordered everything (drinks, appetizer and entrees) all at once.  The manager came by to apologize a couple of times, explaining that there was a \"problem\" in the kitchen, and they gave us our cocktails for free, offered free tequila and brought us free chips and guac, but we really would have preferred to have the service flow more smoothly.  As I said, the staff were well-meaning, but having challenges. We ordered the flan for dessert and, after a longish wait, a server came by and put a steaming shrimp dish on our table. We had to call her back to exchange it for the flan. In terms of the food, the Tapa de Granada was every bit as good as others have said.   My De Oaxaca (chicken with mole sauce) was just ok - the mole sauce was good, but the chicken was overcooked, dry and hard. My partner enjoyed her Paella, until later that night when she got sick. It was the only dish we didn't both eat. I can't help but think that the \"problem\" in the kitchen might have involved the mussels in the Paella. The flan was fine.  It's too bad that we didn't have a better experience, as the prices are very reasonable for a restaurant downtown with an upscale ambience. Everyone's trying very hard, but it's not ready for prime time yet."}
{"text":"Came for an after work function. The service and wine selection were nice. The place offers a good environment for conversation that's not too loud but still with a good vibe."}
{"text":"Came for a friend's birthday.  At the onset, we told the waiter that we cannot eat pork and asked for recommendations. My fiancée and I shared: guacamole, cactus salad, mahi mahi tacos and chicken tacos. Food was very slow to come out. The guacamole was good but came with as much pickled carrots (which were uneaten) as avocado. The cactus salad was gross. The mahi mahi tacos were decent. The chicken in the chicken tacos was dry, but here's the worst part: pork somehow made its way into the tacos! We were completely shocked. Not only did we tell the waiter about our eating restriction, but the chicken tacos aren't even supposed to have pork in them at all (hence why we ordered them).   We complained and the manager gave us an excuse about how the chicken and pork are right next to each other in the kitchen, so it was an \"honest mistake\". Eventually, he dealt with the issue properly by comping our meal. The manager is overall a nice guy but not enough to make up for the fundamental issues that his restaurant faces.   Even if the pork incident didn't happen, the food is not that great, a tad overpriced and the service is extremely slow. Nobody in our party said that they would return. I certainly wouldn't."}
