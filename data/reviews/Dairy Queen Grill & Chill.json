{"text":"We just left this location tonight and it was by far one of the worst services I've ever experienced. All the workers were off task and chatting with one another and ignoring the fact that we were even there.  Every time I've been to this location my ice cream has melted before I even got to it and the same went for tonight. However everything tasted delicious and Dairy Queen quality but the employees were not welcoming at all."}
{"text":"Just left this location. Came to purchase an ice cream and decided to order a #5 combo and sandwich. They gave us the combo and we waited for the second sandwich. People after us got their food before us. We waited 20 minutes for our second sandwich, and it was the wrong one. Kid at the register tried to fix it by giving us extra fries. Hey manager, that African American kid you had working up front did a great job. You should fire the clown you have out back. Playing around and on their phones while the cashier sped through the restaurant to take orders and deliver them. Give him a raise!"}
{"text":"Had a $5 lunch box, hit the spot. The help was pleasant and out going. Service time was acceptable and the food was decent. The facility is new and fairly clean for lunch hours. Over all experience was good. Happy to have a DQ in the area."}
{"text":"I stopped by for late lunch and was pleasantly surprised. I usually frequent other popular burger drive thru and think DQ is just for ice cream.  Well I tried the Deluxe Cheese 5 Buck Lunch and found it delicious and a great value too. The real lettuce and tomato were fresh on the burger, fries were hot and plenty of them too! You even get a yummy sundae for dessert included in the $5.  Drive thru  service was quick and courteous.  On the receipt was a coupon for a $1.99 double bacon cheese grillburger that I'll try later in the week.  Definitely recommend 3308 Baseline, Phx Dairy Queen!"}
{"text":"This is the SLOWEST \"fast\" food place I have been to. My fault....the universe knows I shouldn't be eating like this. The staff doesn't seem to understand the ideas of customer service or print food preparation."}
{"text":"Do not order cakes here. They don't have a design book to choose from. Was directed to their \"cake guy\" who said if we wanted a photo print, to bring rice paper from albertsons's. The Dairy Queen on Warm Springs has a book of designs, can do their own photo prints, and was cheaper than this location."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant and everything inside is nice and new. Our blizzards were out quick and we tried the stuffed cookie - really good! Will be back"}
{"text":"Love the convenience of this location because it is right by a gas station, employees are friendly but check what you receive before leaving, Ive gotten the wrong order before."}
{"text":"I went thru the drive-thru,  ordered a large twist cone, it was the size of a small, 1 blob instead of the normal three. The woman told me it was by weight not size and corporate was here watching! Well, I have never heard that before and after going to DQ all my life, this was a first! This is my first and last visit to this location!! I think it was more about saving money, what would a small look like, a level at the top cone? Take a clue from Mesa Main St, been there for years or others!"}
{"text":"I go practically everyday at lunch time which is usually around noon. The drive through usually gets me out quickly. MY favorite is the five buck lunch and the blizzards are always good."}
{"text":"The wait in the drivethru is sooooooo long!!!! Don't even bother trying to go here. The service is horrible. People just hanging out on there phones and talking instead of working.   I'm sure that means it super clean too."}
{"text":"I only go for the blizzards. Most of the time I go, they get the order wrong. I used to work at a Dq and it's really not hard to get the blizzards right and communicate. I keep having to repeat my order and once the worker said there's no chocolate cheesecake, when the other worker recommended to me lol what? This location is run by teenagers so it's no surprise. Just go for small orders and ALWAYS double check if your order is correct before driving off in the drive thru, or you'll waste your money."}
{"text":"The staff, a bunch of teens that would rather text than work, Lean on the the food areas, touch their face then food....  the attitudes are high as well.   With the handful of employees, you would think it's fast service......   not at all.  Slow- and you get to ove hear all of the obscene conversations.  I've given this place. Chance now since it's opened a few times.   Drive thru- awful, inside- no thanks.   Tonight was the last straw."}
{"text":"So glad to have a Dairy Queen in the area!  I went through the drive through and it went quickly. The food was perfect temperature and staff was friendly. It takes a while for new places to get into the swing of things so here's my funny experience. Me- \"I'd like a mini Reese's Blizzard\" \"A medium Blizzard?\" Me- \"No, a mini\". \"Oh yeah, sorry. Mini. Snickers?\"  Me- \"No, a Reese's.\"  \"Oh yeah, sorry. Ok mini Reese's.\" Anyway the Blizzard  was delicious as was my food. There's outdoor seating with misters which is awesome!"}
{"text":"This the best Dairy Queen ever I will continue to go there as the food is always fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Well I'd have to agree with most everyone and their posts! The classic Dairy Queen blizzard is good but that's about it. We waited in the drive thru line for about 8 min then got to the speaker to order only to be told the ice cream machine wasn't working. The next time we came the service was terrible. We stood in front of the registers and the girl would come out, look at us then walk back into the back. She did this a few times without saying a thing. Then a guy came from the back and actually spoke to us and asked if we needed help deciding or if we were ready to order. There was probably 6 people there working half of which were on cell phones.... Do yourself a favor, just because it's close don't go here. Drive a little further until they get their \"store\" together!"}
{"text":"The classic dairy Queen is not as good as it used to be. I've been to this location several times since it's opening, spent long waits in the drive thru and ordered many blizzard shakes. Everytime I come to this location the service is sub par. The employees act as if they are doing you a favor to serve you. No smiles or joking around here.  Tonight shake just like many before had no toppings at the bottom and was poorly mixed. I have come here several times because of the location but I'm starting to wonder why I even come here at all with the service and product not being so great.  In the future I will probably go to smiths and buy a tub of ice cream. It's probably your best bet especially if you come to this dairy Queen."}
{"text":"Bad! Just Bad! 15 min in the drive through with 2 cars ahead!? For a freaking Blizzard!!"}
{"text":"Stop there this afternoon and wanted to get a quick bite to eat but the girl in the drive-through was so rude I backed up and left I will never go here again for so many other restaurants up and down baseline we don't need to be treated like a five-year-old get real Dairy Queen your employees are rude"}
{"text":"The food was as you'd expect for a DQ, but they are quite stingy with their portions here. Extra pickles are $.40, my blizzard had about 10 pieces of candy (I wish I was exaggerating), and they won't do any upgrades (wanted to pay the difference for a medium blizzard instead of the mini that came with the meal deal and they couldn't accommodate my request). Shawnessy location is much better."}
{"text":"I have visited this Dairy Queen several times since they open and if it wasn't for the location and my kids begging for ice cream, I wouldn't return. Every time has been a bad experience. First, how is a slushee machine broken in a brand new store since they have been open?  Then, there menu is limited compared to other stores and they aren't willing to even make something comparable like the pecan mudslide.  My order has been wrong every time for simple royal blizzards. What makes a royal blizzard?  It's the filling inside!! And they always forget it. Not even an apology when I tell them either. Lastly, there customer service is very poor. From the unprofessional talk and conversations they have among each other, to the ordering in the drive through when you have to repeat your order over and over again because they don't pay attention. Maybe because they are busy with the people in front of me??  Doubtful, because when you pull up to the window, they are playing around with each other and talking about their personal issues.  Its obvious they are their to collect a paycheck and care less about the customers they serve."}
{"text":"Came in 2mins late for the 5 buck lunch speical asked the manager if i could still get the 5 buck meal deal since i was 2mins late phoenix traffic which am not use to since in tucson none of the dq in town have food so after a 2 hour drive i was turn away from the special which didnt matter cause the cheeseburger meal i wanted was cheaper note to self this locate need a real big customer service training"}
{"text":"Feeling annoyed!  Bad policy! I wanted to get the $5 Buck lunch that gives a free sunday.   I got a coupon to redeem for a free mini blizzard. I asked to redeem my free mini blizzard and waive the $1 charge for a small blizzard and replace with a mini...they wouldn't do it!!! Not logical!!! Now they lost my business! Got my free mini blizzard but didn't  order food. Did I mention...IT IS MY BIRTHDAY TODAY!!!  NO EXCEPTION!!!"}
{"text":"I've come to this Dairy Queen 4x now. 2x because I had coupons. Otherwise the prices are RIDICULOUS! I just left there now. I went with my teenage son to get some late night ice cream. Paid almost $10 for a strawberry shake and the worst hot fudge sundae I've ever had. I asked if I could have some nuts. The kid said I'd have to pay 50 cents extra. He then hands me a bowl of vanilla soft serve with a drop of hot fudge around the sides. No whipped cream no nothing! Another time I came the ice cream machine wasn't working right (& they didn't tell us beforehand) and we got blizzards that were half melted so they didn't turn them upside down. I didn't say anything and should have. It wasn't even hot out! I get the bad reviews now. I'll drive the extra miles to wiener schnitzel or sonic from now on..."}
{"text":"Not bad.  I got a chili cheese dog combo with onion rings.  Took about five minutes in drive thru, which seemed a bit slow.  The dog was awfully salty, but the onion rings were good.  I'll be back for a dessert next time."}
{"text":"This is the worst Dairy Queen I have ever had the displeasure of going to. Their employees are so unprofessional and brash, the food is subpar, and the drive through performance is in the same accord. They need new management or better training."}
{"text":"Bad customer service! At the drive thru I placed my order and it was repeated. I had to repeat the order again and the girl finally got it right. When we got to the window and paid for the order I noticed on the receipt it was wrong again. I tell the girl that I'm missing the cheeseburger. She says sorry and it's not a problem. We get our order minus the cheeseburger then an Asian lady scolds the girl and tells her that since I didn't order the cheeseburger at the beginning she should've made me pull up to a stall. The girl explains that it was her fault and the Asian lady says it doesn't matter and gives me an angry look. At this point I'm pissed off and was ready to tell her off. Luckily the cheeseburger came out. I can deal with people making mistakes but to act like an ass to your customers is uncalled for. Especially if the restaurant just opened. Not going back and will pass it on to others to go to another location."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I haven't been in the drive thru without waiting for at least 15 min and allI want is an ice cream. It could be 6pm, 7pm, or 9pm, you will always be expected to wait for 15 to 20 if you use drive thru."}
{"text":"This is annoying. I saw the review about getting orders wrong and we figured, oh we are just getting one blizzard, surely they can't get it wrong.. but guess what? They got it wrong! We ordered a royal blizzard with fudge in the center and paid $6 for it, instead we got a plain blizzard which is cheaper and obviously not as good. The line was long & we got over charged for the product received which was not the one we ordered. Ugh."}
{"text":"Usually love the blizzards at Dairy Queen. From out of state but spotted the DQ at 32nd and Baseline and pulled in for a Banana Split Blizzard, my favorite. Not taking any chances I asked at the window if they use whole strawberries and they said yes strawberries and strawberry sauce. It turned out to be a dud. No sign of any strawberries or sauce,  had a few tiny bits of banana and pineapple mixed with chocolate ice cream. No chunks of fruit or any sign of strawberry, total disappointment. These guys need to go back to blizzard school."}
{"text":"The management cannot have their crew make things right the first time. I have been here four times and each time they made one or more mistake on our order.  The last time we ordered it took them almost 15 minutes to get our food and there was only four tables of people in the restaurant at the time we ordered, and they still got the order wrong.  My wife ordered her sandwich without tomatoes and that came out correct. I ordered my chicken sandwich without any substitutions and they forgot the tomatoes, hardly any lettuce and barely any mayo. Not sure what the management is doing for training, either way it is not working.  Unfortunately these millennial are not being set up for success in. Simple food menu but terribly difficult for them to read the ticket and prepare the order without one mistake.  Unless they get their act together, I would not recommend ordering any food other than their ice cream."}
{"text":"I don't know how you can screw up an Oreo Blizzard but they manage to do it EVERY SINGLE TIME. This is the 3rd time I've gone there and they've given me soft serve with a pinch of oreo crumbs and they've gotten blanantly rude when I've complained. Seriously, whoever hired the Thursday night staff really needs to reevaluate their hiring criteria. Tonight the girl at the window actually rolled her eyes at me while the other girl making it refused to remake it and said she had no idea what I expected. Oreo, I expected oreos in my oreo blizzard. It really says something that the central location always has crackheads hanging out front but still always does an awesome job. I guess I'm just gonna have to deal with crackheads if I want oreos in my oreo blizzard."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Sometimes great, sometimes horrible.   Tonight, HORRIBLE!   my order was four blizzards.. She tried to give me all four without lids. I asked for lids & in a bag. She gave me them in a drink carrier. The lids were forced on spilling it all down the sides of the cups.   I sat there for another 2 minutes to ask for some napkins but the window was closed immediately & no one acknowledged me. So now there is ice cream all over my seat."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Pay $10+ for a Treatzza Pizza AND IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ICE CREAM!! These folks instead sell you a $10 slab of white frosting. When you get home and discover that you just bought frozen frosting and call the store they say \"we don't put ice cream on our pizza's\"   Maybe, just maybe, include this on the item description."}
{"text":"What a joke! I haven't been to Dairy Queen in forever and was craving a blizzard. I stop and ask if they have mini blizzards, turns out they do. I'm thinking yay then I pull up and she tells me it's $3 dollars for three dollars that better be a pretty big mini blizzard. But it's not. The cup is tiny and it's not even full of ice cream. She left a good inch and a half from the top, and in the middle was dug down so actually 2 inches of it wasn't even ice cream. Not coming back. Too expensive and definitely not worth it. Mini blizzards should be $1 !"}
{"text":"Went through drive through . To get quart of ice cream and hot fudge . And we were roundly served by the manager . We simply asked for more hot fudge and that we would pay for it. The woman scoffed at us . When we let her know she was being rude about the situation . And that she needed better customer service . She was even more rude back and then shut window on us . Even though this one is closer and more convenient. We will never go back . Would rather drive to windmill location. For better customer service . Never had a manager act unprofessional."}
{"text":"First time here and the place is packed! Notably the tables & floor etc are CLEAN. Staff are friendly and even as busy as this place is, efficient.   We will most certainly come back here when in the area."}
{"text":"Been long time supporter of Dairy Queen since I was a kid.   This location is a perfect size for the community of Mahogany.   Staff is friendly and bring out food order as this is the Grill concept.   Food portions are good and they is a value combo deals starting at $5.99 includes burger, fries, drink and a sundae.   Seating area is clean and modern.   Overall fans of DQ won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This dairy queen hires anyone without any people skills, worse staff ive ever encountered. I was better off buying a gallon of ice cream from walmart."}
{"text":"I grew up with DQ, this location is new, but doing a great job!  Some growing pains, but I love my blizzards yum!"}
{"text":"While the DQ in McKenzie Towne is closer to home, this one has a full menu. My wife wanted some ice cream after our dinner at the new pho place across the parking lot so we popped in here for some mini blizzards.  On a Sunday night in April it wasn't too busy, though the crap weather this last week might be keeping people away from the frozen treat department. This location has a good amount of seating, but more importantly, is fairly open at the front counter so you won't be feeling like you're in someone's way while waiting for your soft serve."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. My only gripe about this DQ in particular was that they screwed up my order a few times: I got only one chicken wrap instead of two; one of our fries was missing; and we got the wrong flavor of Blizzard. At least the employees were polite and took immediate action when I informed them of their mistakes."}
{"text":"I only got ice cream but it is the same quality as other Dairy Queen locations.    This location has burgers, hot dogs, chicken, fries and much much more.  $5 lunches are a popular hit.  Eat in or take out.  This location has a really nice outdoor seating are too."}
{"text":"Bunch of monkeys working here! Double charged me! Bad service! Didn't hold the blizzard upside down for long enough. You've got to be kidding me!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer services that I have ever experienced.Went  in the drive thru today about 5pm and ordered the $6 Dbl cuz burger meal told the lady I wanted a combo once I got to the window I asked about the ice cream Sunday to it.When asked a bout it I was past off to a girl who decided to raise her voice to me.after repeatly telling her I got it pls lower your voice she rudely continue to  repeat herself.I then told her if she don't lower her voice that I was about to get pissed off as her co worker tried to get her to chill as well she started to yell at them then well I had enough and snapped back at her she then slams the drive thru window with out a word other than a roll of a eye Ever will I go their again as long as they hire disrespectful employees like this for sure stay away they suck"}
{"text":"This Dairy Queen has to be the best I've ever been to it was so clean and everyone was so nice and friendly including the manager and the cashier I got my food in a timely manner fresh and hot and the drinks were nice and cold and when the drink machine suddenly stopped  working because I hit the wrong button the manager promptly stopped what she was doing and help me fix it. The outside of the building was clean and everyone was just so helpful I will definitely be back to this location"}
{"text":"I stopped in to this new location and had a burger today, usually just go for the peanut buster parfaits . I had the half pound flame thrower and it was quite good, lots of beef and a nice sorta not really spicy but still good sauce. And bacon. I didn't have anything else, but didn't really need anymore after the burger. The lady working behind the till was named precious and she was very nice, and brought the food out."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 0 stars. Waited in the drive thru forever. Finally ordered. I understand they are busy. But, \"T\" took my order and she was very confused and extremely RUDE. Finally, I get to the window and the girl that I paid was very sweet and kind(she gets my 1 star) she handed me 2 blizzards. She asked do you have more coming. I replied yes I have one more. She walks around the corner and \"T\" proceeds to scream and yell at the poor girl \"Hell no! She did not order another blizzard, I heard her order 2. She's a F***ing liar if she said that she ordered 3, oh hell no I am not making her another one\" this went on for at least a full minute at the top of her lungs. Everyone in the store stopped and listened to her freak out. It was complete madness. I heard everything she said and so did my 8yr old son. But of course she would not walk around the corner and speak or yell at me. She did make the missing blizzard. I kindly told the poor girl that I did not want that blizzard. I have no idea what \"T\" did to that blizzard and it was for my son.  To be honest I am not surprised after reading all of the reviews since it's been open. I will for sure be driving to Southern Highlands from now on."}
{"text":"Fast-forward a few months:  Husband decided to bring home a chocolate malt for both of us as a surprise, which was very sweet.  He began sipping on his malt and made a funny face.  \"This tastes like a shake, not a malt.  And it has way too much chocolate in it.\"  I had to remind him why I stopped going there.  Then I read all of the bad reviews since my first review.  Wow, DQ.  Do yourselves a favor and hire a quality manager.  Oh, and call another DQ store to find out how the rest of the DQ's in the valley make THEIR chocolate malts."}
{"text":"$1.84 for a kid's cone!!???  OUTRAGEOUS. Slow drive-thru even with one car.  Unfriendly staff. How is this place in business??"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the place was clean and there prices are reasonable but when I got home I got a strong headache ."}
{"text":"We have gone twice now and each time I have gotten a chocolate dipped cone. The chocolate was so thick I couldn't bite into it. Once I did it made a mess all over me.  My mom asked for extra chocolate and they gave her extra everything else."}
{"text":"Pretty average for a DQ. Good ice cream. Mediocre food and service."}
{"text":"Slow turnaround. Got order wrong. Manager was understanding. Because I had to wait so long they compensated my order. I'm willing to give this another try because they were so understanding"}
{"text":"1st visit chili dogs were good. 2nd visit the ice cream sandwiches had ice crystals in the ice cream. 3rd and last visit the chili dog was not even cooked. They put a cold uncooked hotdog on a bun and poured hot chili over it...yuck!!   Next time,  I will drive to the hotdog restaurant near Tempe Towne Marketplace."}
{"text":"Terrible management and service. They gave me the wrong order and the manager accused me of taking the patties off the double cheeseburgers and I was trying to get free food. Told him I spent over 30 dollars and I should get what I pay for. Bad management and how dare he accuse the customer. Look at ur camera buddy."}
{"text":"I could write a book about dairy queen and its amazingness but I think i will stick to the Average length of a yelp review. The chicken tender basket is the go to. The chicken itself if whatever but the country gravy and those always frezh out the oil fries are amazing. So i like to make little sandwichies with the texas toast fries and chicken, throw a litttle gravy on there and boom, youve got heaven on your tongue. Everyone and theyre mom knows how amazing the blizzards are. They are thick and creamy and they are the only place that really gives you awesome options. They will put candy in anything you want. The burgers are really good for fast food. They dont skimp you on the cheese and i swear they have created a whole different kind of pickle that you cant get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Ok honestly, we were super pumped this DQ was opening, but it's been terrible service since opening. Our family only comes here for the ice cream, and the last time we ordered three different kinds of blizzards and when we got home realized they were all plain vanilla ice cream. That's a pretty big mistake.   We decided to give this location one more chance, went through the drive through and ordered one of the ice creams with a caramel fill/core. The man over the intercom told us that he won't do that since he's had customers make special requests and then complain about them. We assured him that we've ordered this several times and there wouldn't be any complaints. He explained that he is the manager and that he is unwilling to accommodate our special request. The fact that he was a manager and could have easily decided to give us something SO SIMPLE but refused was the last straw. We will not be returning to this location and will go out of our way the extra 10 minutes to go to a better Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"We decided to grab a yummy treat tonight because our air conditioning wasn't working in the van! When you're from Wyoming and it's hot outside, a cool treat always satisfies.   We enjoyed the strawberry cheesecake blizzard, the ever popular peanut Buster Parfait and a cute vanilla cone.   The drive-through service was excellent! It didn't take long for them to whip up our order and have this happily on our way!  Tips and tricks - if you're not hungry enough for a full peanut Buster Parfait, order a hot fudge sundae with Spanish peanuts. It is cheaper and taste just the same---awww tricky Huh!?"}
{"text":"Would really like to give this place more stars because the food is tasty but the service is piss poor. I was there on 6/26/2018 & again on 6/29/2018 and purchase the same things but was charged differently. First time gal charged me for a CC Dog, no chz, add ketchup was $2.69 .....next time was charged for Hot Dog, add ketchup for $2.84... I had them ask the manager...he didn't see anything wrong. I'd say they need a new manager!!!!!! They have a great product...so again I'd say they must need a new manager:("}
{"text":"For being a ice cream shop, they sure do have poor quality ice cream, let alone, never even having chocolate ice cream. Only having to choose between 2 ice cream flavors, never having chocolate is a problem. Never the less, all my blizzards have been half way melted before even receiving them. Would think twice before going to this \"ice cream\" shop."}
{"text":"Subpar ice cream. How do you mess up ice cream??? I had a peanut butter Reece's blizzard and it tasted absolutely disgusting!!! Had to throw it out. Yuck.  Customer service is non existent. Employees look uncleanly and unkept. Drive through service is a joke. Need new management!!! Won't be going back. It's a shame because it's a Brand new location and I had high expectations."}
{"text":"Dear Dairy Queen,  I came in through the drive-thru and ordered your chicken strip basket today. I was given a chicken strip basket with no gravy. When I asked where the gravy was you tried to up charge me $0.38. What the what!? I wanted what was pictured. What is pictured is chicken strips, fries, toast, and... Guess what, GRAVY!  Ps. Your food is still delicious."}
{"text":"I have to echo the other comments about customers not receiving their order as ordered. We had a similar situation today we ordered our lunch and it came to is incorrectly, two of three items. We made a separate dessert order and one of three of those items came out incorrect. Someone did give us some coupons for free menu items which is fine. Really the more disturbing part is the first comments about mistakes in orders were made 3 - 4 weeks ago and it would appear as if nothing has changed."}
{"text":"We stopped going to the Dairy Queen at Eastern and Horizon Ridge because everything smelled like rancid grease.  We'd get ice cream and then our clothes would stink for days. Went through the drive through of this new Dairy Queen and ordered burgers and fries.  When they opened the drive through window to take our money....there was the smell again!  REALLY....? Our food was good but I don't know if I can continue to go there due to their gross and greasy smell!"}
{"text":"Asked for my burger to be well done and the worker asks the other worker how do I put well done and she shakes her head and says it's cooked. I ask her can it be well done she's says again it's cooked I say ok I'll just bring it back up here if it's not cooked well enough..she says  it goes through a machine once it's cooked ..ya I get it you said it 3 times it's cooked but now I don't even want to eat here because of your shitty attitude ...went to Wendy's paid less and they were much nicer."}
