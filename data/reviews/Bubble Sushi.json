{"text":"We ordered a take out from Bubble Sushi through Save the Dishes and everything from the ordering process to the taste of food was a pleasant experience.  They delivered the food far ahead the estimated delivery time.  I find it a bit pricey but the food is worth it. I would definitely recommend Bubble Sushi!"}
{"text":"The sushi is just OK, nothing special. The food was fresh. I ordered through an online take out website and that was flawless.  The sushi kind of reminds me of the sushi you would get at a grocery store. One thing I did like is they were very reasonable in terms of how much rice goes into each roll.  This is definitely geared towards take-out only as there is not much of a store front."}
{"text":"Got a roll combo to take away, price is good but the taste not so much, too much rice and the ginger tastes like plastic."}
{"text":"I love finding these tiny, hole-in-the-wall type places. I've driven past here on my way to Salsita, which is in the same complex.  They belong to the \"Don't cook, just eat\" delivery service, and I would guess that most of their business is take out. But don't be fooled! There are tables here to sit and enjoy a quick bite.  The menu offers a good selection if very reasonably priced sushi, many items being just $1. I opted for the \"Salmon lovers\" combo. It had 3 pieces of salmon sushi, 3 pieces of salmon sashimi, and a California roll type maki that had salmon on the outside with a spicy mayo drizzle. For just $10, it was a good deal and very tasty. The salmon tasted fresh, so all good here.  I didn't have their bubble tea today, however, they do have a good selection. Of flavors to choose from.  I will definitely be back the next time I need a quick snack or lunch."}
{"text":"Sushi here is on the same level of sushi that you would get at a convenience store or a mall, so not great, but bareable. I got Combo A, and it was approximately 7 dollars for some pieces of raw fish that were not good enough to eat and 6 pieces of california roll. Also got the noodle and pop combo for 5 dollars but I should've just saved my money.   The noodles are a popular brand of dry instant noodles that I can get anywhere for about 4 dollars for a pack of 10. Watched them microwave it for a bit and then hand it over to us with 3 pieces of meat inside.   There was a hair inside the noodle as well, but I had already left so could not say anything about it. Pretty gross.  The inside looks awful. The side wall is covered with a shower curtain and there are an assortment of tables and chairs that are strewn about at random."}
{"text":"My family really enjoys the sushi and smoothies, either dining in or taking out.  This is a great place for kids, little ones will love the fruit smoothies with fruit jellies inside.  The fish tanks add a nice touch, and the service is reasonably quick.  Prices can't be beat!  Geisha roll is my favorite.  The five stars are for: great value, fast friendly service, nice atmosphere, tasty food, and tasty drinks."}
{"text":"They know their market, unsuspecting junior high students, the meal deal....pop and noodles (ichiban fried in soy and peanut oil) MICROSCOPIC MEAT less than the size of a thumbmail and that thin and sinewy, is their luch special .No thought to student consumption , nor any one's. the only star they deserve is their bubble tea and it is substandard."}
{"text":"Rude service. Cheap but totally overpriced for the quality of food you get. $5 for chicken fried noodles with pop sounds like a good deal except for the fact that the noodles were definitely out of an instant noodle package and there were maybe 3 pieces of chicken the size of maybe a fingernail in the entire thing. Bubble tea is mediocre at best and the pearls are hard. Passable if you have never tried Asian food in your life though."}
