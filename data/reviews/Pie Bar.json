{"text":"The place was great. Good food. Cute decor. Our server was really great. Lots of fun."}
{"text":"I was getting takeout at a nearby restaurant and a server from pie bar starts walking around handing out mushroom pizzas for everyone around the area. It was absolutely delicious. Taste and texture were amazing. It had a really rich mushroom taste from end to end (or tip to crust) so more than just having mushrooms thrown on top of the pizza. Im a meat lover so I usually put lots of meat on my pizza but I would be more than happy to skip the meat if it was for this mushroom pizza. Pretty excited to see the quality of their other pizzas too. Very impressed.   Only reason why a five star wasn't given was because I only had a slice and I'd like to try the whole pizza to comment on consistency which is important especially for pizza if you don't want to experience inconsistencies like size of the pizza slices, toppings not evenly spread, etc. Also, price matters so not sure what that's like. Got a takeout menu though, so I hope to try a paid pizza soon..."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town...It was my first time, I ordered a pizza and it was really good. The place is clean and organized, the service was fast. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'd actually give this restaurant a zero star rating, but Yelp won't let me do so.   My boyfriend and I had dinner there this past Sunday night (August 6), and were wary of our waiter from the minute we got there. We figured he probably wasn't too pleased that he had to work on a long weekend, so we let a lot of his attitude slide.   A few minutes before our bill came, I got up to go use the ladies room. When I returned, I noticed my boyfriend standing outside the restaurant. I asked him what had happened, and he noted that while I was gone the waiter asked him if he was 'dating that thing,' and that it was 'nice of me to leave right before the bill came.'  Oh, HI. It is absolutely none of your business how we manage our bills. As a new business looking to attract customers, you probably shouldn't be hiring disrespectful, and clearly very unhappy people.   I can guarantee that I will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone. Fair warning fellow Yelp-ers!  (I can't remember the waiter's name, but he was blonde and had a creepy mustache)."}
{"text":"I came across this spot by mistake, and I'm glad I did. Very friendly staff, but it's just another slice of Pittsburgh pizza..... which happens to be the best pizza you can consume!! Great spot overall!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty new and near my house so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I placed an order for pick up and it was ready in 15 minutes.  There wasn't anything super unique about the taste, but their preparation was perfect.  It seems like they use quality ingredients and the crust was cooked just right - slightly crispy on the bottom.  (I don't like when my pizza is soggy.)  Overall I'll definitely go back.  It was nice and clean inside and the staff was friendly.  It seems like they are going for more of the sit down crowd."}
{"text":"Best Bruschetta EVER!! Great service! Our waiter was Christopher, the best!! Will go again, for sure. Fresh pasta also."}
{"text":"Tasty pizzas and pasta with friendly service along the water.  Great way to spend a Sunday evening."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Friendly service and good pizza. Their gelato is also delicious. The only downside is the price--kind of expensive for the size of the pizza. Still I've had two different pizzas here and both were great. It's a great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great wood fired pizza and tasty pasta location. A bit hidden at night, but we were able to find the location from the on line map! Kids menu covered chicken, pizza and pasta , just what you'd expect! The atmosphere was cool with low lights and a simple but aesthetically pleasing decor! They had the maple leafs game on so a bit of a sports bar feel. Everyone was very helpful and super friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is super slow make you wait en if not busy and then at the end  burn the pizza A big Meh!"}
{"text":"This neighbourhood is really lacking for good restaurants. This place gets a solid three stars as a result. Food is good - the prosciutto pizza and the spicy pie pizza were both good. Surprisingly, the sangria was also good (I find restaurant Sangria is usually pretty awful and sweet). This place has a nice patio and worth a visit if you're in the area. Not sure this place is worth visiting in the winter (in fact I wonder if they will close in the winter)."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the area and checked out Pie Bar.  It was a gem of a place right on the lake.  We asked the server for a wine recommendation and she brought over her manager, Teresa, who, not only gave a great suggestion for a superb wine, she also recommended  some great food choices from the menu, which we tried and were absolutely delicious.  We had a great experience, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I had the godfather pizza here and it was delicious! The garlic bread was also to die for and I would recommend anyone who's in the city to come and try this place out. I believe my servers name was Joe or Joey and he was very helpful. Great service & great food!"}
{"text":"Pizza was mediocre and the service was horrible. There were three employees working but only one was actually doing her job. She was overwhelmed and complained every time we saw her, which was max 3 times in over an hour. Thankfully I had a pen with me or we would've waited another half our to close out our checks. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Just happened upon this place and loved it! 1/2 off on all drafts for happy hour. Had a steak wedgie, which is pizza dough with ingredients like steak and cheese and lettuce tomatoes and dressing and the crust was delish. Very nice atmosphere, clean and friendly staff!! Def coming back."}
{"text":"I love this spot and its location. In the summer sit outside and enjoy the weather and view and in the winter, the window spots are great.  The staff have been awesome every time I've visited - they are warm, friendly, personable, and accommodating...a big win for me.  (I met the Manager one time when I went and didn't find her as friendly as the staff!...) the food is also great...I've visited with small groups and large and everyone has enjoyed their  meals. Thank you for being in the neighborhood :)"}
{"text":"Unpleasant experience. I ask the waitress if they can make 4 ppl table to 6 ppl for party joining late. The girl said need to ask manager, then she NEVER came back. When I call the manager, he blamed me to ask for a change that they can't do. He doesn't understand what I want is a response. I won't mind move inside or have a separate table, but leave customer aside without a response is very bad."}
{"text":"One night, I was craving some really delicious pizza, after a night out with friends. Walking down E Carson street back to my car, Pie Bar caught my eye.   It's pretty nice inside- updated, spacious, and clean. Two workers sat inside on their phones, barely looking up. After taking our order, they went to the back room and played on their phones while our pizza was being heated up. We had a chance to admire the place a little more- reasonably priced and looking like your standard pizza shop, we were impressed and wondered why we hadn't learned of this place sooner.   When the pizza came out, it was hot to taste and we were asked if we needed napkins or a drink. I'm not sure why, but I have always been a fan of canned mushrooms rather than fresh ones, and that's the type that was on my slice. My husband ordered a gyro and thought it was really delicious.   Glad we ran into this hidden-- or not so hidden-- gem on our walk home. It hit the spot, was reasonably priced, and was a perfect place to grab a bite after a night out."}
{"text":"I wanted to like the pizza at Pie Bar, but it's just not very good. The crust was pretty soggy - I love a thin crust but this wasn't cooked well. I never in a million years thought I'd say this about anything, but there was almost too much cheese on the pizza. It was a little gross as the oil separated and left the remaining cheese super chewy and unappealing.   The pizza was ready really quickly, but unfortunately the quality was lacking. With such better options within walking distance, I doubt that I'll have pizza from here again."}
{"text":"$18 for this! Need I say more? Ok I will. Come on lads. In what world is this worth $18? This is apparently a large portion which we paid $5 extra for. The box was 1/3 full. I understand you have to make a profit but come on let's not take the piss. We tried calling the place to complain 3 times but nobody answered. The sauce was nice but the pasta was mushy."}
{"text":"Great pizza, the sauce is absolutely amazing ,i had the pepperoni and it tasted amazing, I asked the cook about it , he said it was a high end type.  The Swiss Burger is mouthwatering and the appetizers are really fresh and well cooked.  I think I am a regular customer.   ....the people are great too."}
{"text":"Super great place for dinner.  My wife andI came and loved it.  The view and the environment.  Great food and good service, good pricing too.  Coming back when in Toronto."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing server! I believe his name was Eric - He was extremely personable and friendly. My meal was delicious and my waiter knew how to tend to my needs as I am gluten free. He made sure everything I ordered was to my standard and because of him I will go there again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in pittsburgh! Great place with a very friendly staff! Worth a try, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My go to pizza spots in the Southside are Benny's and Michael's. Since I love them so much, I was skeptical when trying Pie Bar. But, since I live on 21st, I had to try this simply because of convenience.   I ordered a pepperoni pizza and an order of breadsticks for pickup. The renovated bar and restaurant look really nice inside, but there was not one person in the whole place (on a Saturday night at 6PM). I took the pizza home and was excited to give it a shot! Upon opening the box, I could instantly tell the small pieces of pepperoni weren't going to be that good, and the pizza and breadsticks were about 3-5 minutes undercooked. This made the pizza chewy and kind of gross. I probably won't be back here unless I'm super lazy and don't feel like going to my normal spots.  No pizza is bad pizza, but there's certainly better pizza in the Southside."}
{"text":"I'll list everything that was wrong with this establishment.  First, the waitress seemed brainless, she didn't seem like she wanted to be there and had a lazy demeanour. She only had 2 tables to serv. We were wondering why our food took so long and when we told her, it magically all came out at once, cold.  She basically left it sitting on the counter forever while she was in the corner folding cutlery into napkins.  Then she came and asked how the food was, I told her it was reheated by the other waitress. And she said \"oh sorry\" like she didn't seem like she was really sorry.   Worst part to finish off: she took forever to split the bill, had to ask her colleague and then billed us 18% service fee for 4 adults and 2 infants (I bet they treated the infants as adults), I would have argued this stupid policy and called the manager were I not in such rush. No wonder she looked like she didn't care.  Overall, the food was not special at all, and I would not recommend. You'd get much better service and quality for the same price at a place like Terroni's."}
{"text":"Tried 2 pies. Hilariously long wait. Server didn't check in or offer to refill water during 30+ minute wait. Sadly pizza wasn't anything to get excited about either."}
{"text":"We ordered the \"Fancy Guy\" pizza (basil pesto sauce, prosciutto, spinach, goat cheese, & sundried tomatoes) for delivery to our hotel downtown. It took about 40 minutes to get here. The pizza was great - hearty, flavorful, quality ingredients. The spinach was done well and it did not make the pizza soggy. We also got a nice slice of NY style cheesecake. Was happy with the order!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed  I came in thinking this should be a nice experience it was my friend's birthday and she decided to try this place from the beginning the waiter looked like he was tired of us it was Sunday it was a long weekend but there was a lot of Empty Tables yet the service was extremely slow it took half an hour to get drinks after ordering them it took over an hour for our food to come out and when we brought backed up the waiter just says yeah we've been running around not even an apology for the long wait  I ordered the Godfather Pizza this is not my first time having what oven pizza and I would say the taste was very underwhelming and I wasn't that thrilled especially having to wait so long the cheese was really thick and tasted kind of plastic key I honestly wouldn't go back there and wouldn't recommend it to anyone either if you're in the area and you don't have any other choice then sure try it  As for appetizers the calamari tasted okay I wish it did come with another sauce other than marinara the bruschetta tasted good as well but it was really soggy because they put too much tomato on it"}
{"text":"we stopped in last night for happy hour. Appetizers are half off as well as drafts (Mon-Fri 5pm-7).   We ordered buffalo chicken tenders and Cajun fries. I also ordered a Stella (on tap!) The bartender was super friendly and made great conversation with us.   The happy hour is good, but all of the apps are fried foods. I would have loved nachos, hummus or sliders as appetizer options.   Overall, its not bad"}
{"text":"Ok, it does smell good.  It also tastes good!  I should have eaten a whole pizza alone.  Instead, I shared it and walked away hungry!  I want more!!  You have to try the bruschetta!  Amazing!  The same bread used for pizza hosts the flavorful bruschetta.  If you try anything at Pie Bar, this is it!  When the weather is warm,  dine outside for some nice people and harbor watching."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour yesterday. What a treat! Already planning my trip back. Happy hour wines for $6 waitress suggested an Italian Chardonnay it was delicious. Had a pizza and asked to make it spicy! They did! It was so good! Excellent and friendly service with a lovely patio. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Usually go on Mondays. They have 50 cent wings (which are excellent and they also can mix flavors sometimes). They also have a FREE comedy show which is excellent, good drink specials, and I always have a great time. I've been coming consistently for a few months now and have never had anything short of a great time!  The pizza is good - not the best, but not bad. It's more of a thinner, New York style crust, but not bad. The rest of the menu looks pretty decent, but I have a hard time straying from the wings when I go.  The atmosphere is comfortable. It's not the same overplayed filament lighting/exposed brick/duct work everywhere. It's just a nice cozy spot with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Third time we came here and everything is always sooo good and fresh. The environment is really nice too, very clean. We took our kids and they love it here. This is definitely our forever pizza spot!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to grab a slice until midnight. They do have a bar, but I've only gone here for for takeout pizza. I ordered a slice with feta, mushrooms & spinach. My only dislike was that the mushrooms come from a can. It's cheap,  & service is fast, so if you need a quick bite, or wana hang for a few beers, this is a good place to stop."}
{"text":"Popped in here today for lunch before a show at the Fleck Dance Theatre. This place is a great addition to the Queen's Quay Terminal. I had the Italian Salad for a starter and a Margherita pizza for my main. The salad was really tasty and the pizza was good too. I really enjoyed the crust as it was that perfect amount of chew. My only note is I would have liked a little more fresh basil. The things that can't be beat about his place were our view, a choppy grey but still stellar Lake Ontario, and our server who was attentive and lovely.  All in all, it was a very enjoyable lunch, and I felt well fortified to chaperone 35 students in a dance performance!"}
