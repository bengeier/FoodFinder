{"text":"I'm partial to a good Sicilian pizza because it reminds me of my childhood.  And for me, Bella Donne does it good.  It may not be the best, but I like it and the staff has always been friendly when I call in my orders and pick up.  (I've never had them deliver.)

I've enjoyed their hoagies and salads as well.  Nice staff, reasonable prices and location will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I got take out from here this past Tuesday evening for dinner.  Whenever I phoned in my order for a 16\" pepperoni pizza I was told that it would be ready in about 15-20 minutes.  It probably took me around 30 minutes to make my way over to the restaurant and it was out of the oven and waiting whenever I arrived.  Whenever I got home I was excited to try the pizza because it smelled pretty good.  Sadly the pizza did not do anything to distinguish itself from the many other pizzeria's in the area.  The sauce was normal and the cheese and pepperoni both good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  My only real comment on it is that I wish that the bottom of the pizza wouldn't have been as mushy as it was.  The bottom line for me is that I may come back here again due to the proximity to my house but I would not actively seek it out.  The pizza was decent but I often look for better than decent."}
{"text":"Normally I do not write reviews. Very disapointed in their service. Not sure what type of people they employ here but they are incapable of delivering a pizza which is located 200 ft from their store. After that they decide to cancel the order without notice. Incompetence comes to mind. Much better pizza and service can be ordered up the street. I hope they go out of business. After calling back on a status update on our order they hung up. I am planning on writing a negitive comment everyday. Management be warned."}
