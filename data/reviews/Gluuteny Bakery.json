{"text":"Awful Cake made in unhealthy way. I bought for my Son's b'day and wanted to take it to the playground to share with other kids. The cake has serious problems with the way how it was made. It doesn't taste like a cake and was like you are eating sugar syrup. Returned it in 15 mins after taking it home. She took my number and told the manager will call me. She never called back. I called her back again and left a VM for them and they returned the call after a month and asked me to order something new. I told her about my previous experience and she said she will ask the manager to call back. She finally called and said they were sorry but couldn't issue a refund since they didn't find any problems. Well, I wasn't looking for the refund but I would have been happy if they could just respectfully acknowledge the problem. These people have attitude, they are not getting by business back ever."}
{"text":"OMG! I want to cry! Being a gluten-free girl for nearly 3 years, one of the things I missed the most was a chewy chocolate chip cookie! Well, miss no more! My niece, who lives in Port Vue introduced me to Gluuteny, & my search for phenomenal gluten-free baked goods is over! I stock up on things every time I come up; and when I run out, I have things shipped to Florida where I live! It is totally worth it! Keep up the great work, Gluuteny! You allow people who have food restrictions to feel half-way normal again ... if only for a little while!!! Me love you long time!"}
{"text":"So good! I've only stuck to the vegan varieties, but each one blew me away. So moist and tasty! I have yet to have a bite that was too \"sugary\", like most reviewers recall. I Could not tell the difference between what they offer and a standard bakery. It is pricey but most bakeries are these days. 5 *'s!"}
{"text":"Great place for vegans to get their sinful pleasure on. Their vegan selections changes by the season so that vegans won't get bored of having the same thing over and over."}
{"text":"Everything is sooooo good! I can't even tell it is gluten free. I especially like the white almond cupcakes, and walnut brownies with ganache icing.  The pizza pockets also rock my socks!!"}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and came across this cute little bakery. They had the best brownies and cookies ever!!! Reasonably priced. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I think the prices could be lower for what is offered (you pay more for the same loaf of gluten free bread at Gluuteny than at Giant Eagle right next to it). The cookies were amazing though.

I was not expecting their products to also be primarily vegan. Their pizza rolls (bread with tomato sauce and \"cheese\") was not worth it. I like my cheese and animal products, just not the gluten. At least I know where to go for amazing gluten free cookies!"}
{"text":"I'm not gluten intolerant, but I like trying new things, so I decided to head over to this bakery to check it out. I've only visited it a few times, but they usually carry an assortment of small tortes (blueberry, cherry, apple, pumpkin when I was there last), lemon tea cookies, mexican wedding cookies, an assortment of cookies, cupcakes, doughnuts, regular brownies or brownies with frosting, and prepared mixes. I've had an apple tart (torte maybe? - not sure what the difference is) and it was very good. It had a nice sweet flavor, but not overpowering. I've also had their lemon tea cookies and mexican wedding cookies and they are very good as well. Sweet, but not gross, so you don't feel too bad about eating them. I haven't tried their cupcake, doughnuts, or brownies, but I've been told they are amazing (and they certainly look terrific). The brownies with frosting look really, really good and I can't wait to try them!!
I have to say though, the place is a little expensive (I was expecting it). It's still worth treating yourself (TREAT YO SELF!!) to!! I think this is especially good for people who can't eat gluten because it's just like eating regular sweets (which is naturally awesome)."}
{"text":"Ordered their pumpkin cupcakes to have available as a GF option at my wedding. Everyone raved about them, including guests who typically wouldn't try GF items."}
{"text":"The chocolate brownie with walnuts is to die for!! Thankfully a place to get gluten free baked goods without sacrificing flavor.  

Love it!!"}
{"text":"They have great sweets and -- in particular -- excellent brownies. But wow is everything waaaaaaaaaaaaay overpriced. Take a mess of $$$ with you."}
{"text":"I just purchased a chocolate chip cookie from here, and a single cookie contains an appalling 3 grams of trans fats! Never buying anything from here again."}
{"text":"I understand compromises must be made when making cakes without flour (must add lots of sugar). That being said, the 3 10-inch cakes I ordered for a party turned out well, but not great.

Of the 3 cakes I ordered--(1) carrot cake with cheese cake icing, (2) chocolate cake with raspberry filling and chocolate icing, and (3) almond cake with vanilla icing and sprinkled with slivered almonds--the chocolate cake turned out best.

I was pleased with the cakes' taste, but most disappointed with the way they are decorated. The ordinary decoration makes the cakes look like they were purchased purchased from Costco or Sam's Club!"}
{"text":"I'm from Seattle and I was in Pittsburgh/Squirrel Hill to visit my daughter who is attending grad school there.  We visited this bakery with high hopes.  My daughter and I bought two berry turnovers, an iced sugar cookie, and two pumpkin tarts/cups.

The pumpkin tarts were decent enough but the frosted sugar cookie was outstanding.

The fruit pastries were terrible!  Both my daughter and I found the
crust to be chewy, dry, and bland.  We both wondered if the baker had
forgotten to add the shortening, vanilla, and sugar that day.

Perhaps I hit the bakery on an off day.  That being said, I cannot 
rave about it since I have had much better elsewhere. Stick with
the frosted sugar cookies and you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Since I'm on a strict gluten-free diet, I am sooo grateful for Gluuteny. The muffins are better than regular bakeries, much more moist. The cookies are my favorite. For $2.50 the cookie is pure delight!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 5 stars for customer service! Placed the order of treats for a friends bday in Pittsburgh to be delivered thru Uber Eats. Sent a message to the bakery to add a note on the box and my friend sent a pic of the box with ribbon and a note card...presentation was super nice. Based on the other reviews I'm sure he'll enjoy the baked goods, will definitely recommend this business!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. We happened upon them when I was in Pittsburgh a couple of years ago for surgery. If you can go to the bakery get a brownie. Best brownie gluten free or not!  Their mixes especially the flour makes it possible to fry chicken and use it as regular flour. I live in West Virginia and they do free shipping for orders over $50.  There has never been a problem getting it within a day or so.  I can make pepperoni rolls using the pizza mix and the pie crust is the best."}
{"text":"This is such a staple to the squirrel hill area. This bakery smells amazing when you enter and their baked goods are wonderful. I haven't had a gob in almost 4 years and seeing they had gluten free gobs I was beyond excited! Their chocolate chip cookies were very very good!"}
{"text":"As someone who has celiac disease I cannot speak loudly enough about how ecstatic I was when I found out this place was opening.  Let me first say, gluten-free living is not always a lifestyle choice, it can be due to medical reasoning such as celiac disease so not everyone is doing it as a fad...some people have to do this for the rest of their life and having a dedicated bakery is a dream come true because there isn't as high of a risk for cross contamination like there is everywhere else.

Their baked goods are absolutely amazing.  I wasn't as impressed with their bread/buns, but the pastries more than made up for it.  I have had numerous iced sugar type cookies, fruit turnovers, and various other sweets that they have baked and each item has exceeded my expectations of gluten-free food.  I've tasted various other gluten-free delicacies from other stores that were not fresh baked or were pre-packaged and they cannot even compare to the heaven I feel in my mouth when I eat from Gluuteny.

I had a birthday cake from them this past November of 2008 and it was excellent.  I actually teared up because of how good it was.  It has been years since I've been able to indulge in a birthday cake.  The cake was moist just like a normal cake and the icing was sweet.  It wasn't the dry or crumbling disaster that most gluten-free foods are.  Not to mention it was beautifully decorated!  I will definitely consider them for my wedding cake.  In fact, reminiscing about it right now has made me want to order another!

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  I've always been greeted with a pleasant employee in a very nice atmosphere.  Every time I've visited, there have been several free samples to try and different new pastries.  This is especially important for those of you who do not want to waste money on something that you do not know for sure if you will like.  I've had this issue before when buying pre-packaged food from other stores in the area, I pay ten dollars for something and find out that I do not like it.  Not at Gluuteny!  You can even ask for samples and the employees are happy to assist!

Of course, there is a trade off...the price.   Things are a bit higher priced than you would think because most of you are used to buying cheap non-gluten-free foods; that's just how most gluten-free food is.  However, this gluten-free food is definitely worth the price as opposed to the pre-packaged stuff I mentioned before.  

My non-gluten-free boyfriend even loves their stuff!"}
{"text":"This is a MUST STOP when I visit my family.  I have never eaten such AWESOME gluten free baked goods, EVER!  YUMMY!  The Whoopie Pies are to die for!  Since I live so far away I have also used their cookie mixes.  Can't say enough GREAT things about these folks!  I wish they'd open a location in Eugene, Oregon!  YUMMY!  DEE-LISH!  Wish I had me a Whoopie Pie right now! :)"}
{"text":"Had to write a comment because that's the only way I can stop thinking about the incredible cappuccino cupcake I Just ate!!! A huge sélection with every possible flavors! An absolute paradise for gluten, dairy free and vegans !"}
{"text":"This place is great - their pumpkin spice macaroons are amazing and the service was very warm and friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great treats! I love that I can purchase their items elsewhere too! The only thing I hated was their apple pie. Really gross. Other than that I actually enjoy everything I get there."}
{"text":"Top notch stuff here - I highly recommend it! The staff is knowledgeable on allergies as well!"}
{"text":"Great desserts for people with gluten & dairy allergies/sensitivities! I've had the brownie w/walnuts, and it was delicious. Also had the cookie cream sandwich, which was fun and yummy! Definitely will come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was sitting in class the other day, thinking \"Cream cookie sandwich, you will be mine\", after catching a glimpse of a photo of it somewhere.

So after the school week was over, I marched into Gluuteny Bakery with my classmate and ordered that cream cookie sandwich, along with a pink frosted sugar cookie, and a pumpkin tart. I had deprived myself over the week and needed, wanted more? Granted, prices are a little steeper than your normal bakery shop, but I'm sure it's because of the selective ingredients and possibly more bake time. Whatever, I'm okay with it.

Okay, well, I ate the sugar cookie almost immediately and thought it to be quite fluffy and the frosting was not at all overwhelming. Later that evening, I ate that cream cookie sandwich and it was so worth it. It's like eating cupcake frosting sandwiched between two soft chocolate chip cookies. Well, that's exactly what it is. Yum! I wanted more. But I have to suppress my fatty desires. The following day, I ate the pumpkin tart, after I had refrigerated it, and it was like a mini pumpkin pie. Quite tasty.

Overall, I think I'll be back. But I may have to pace myself because I could see why coming back on a weekly or even twice a month basis could be dangerous."}
{"text":"As a newly gluten-free (due to a medical condition) Pittsburger, I am so happy to have found Gluuteny Bakery.  I made my first stop in today to try a chocolate chip cookie. I was super excited to find out that I can still have a delicous, moist and chewy cookie on this diet. It was the best thing I have found since I went GF. I will be back whenever I am in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Probably the closest thing Pittsburgh has to a vegan bakery (such things exist, but are rare, and Pittsburgh's vegan scene is doing pretty well). 

It's a tiny store, but lots of options and friendly staff, and clearly bustling on a busy afternoon before Thanksgiving. I picked up some cupcakes and a donut, which were really good, but not the most awesome I've ever had - compare Pepples Donuts and Timeless Coffee (both Oakland California) and The Flying Apron (Redmond Washington). 

Only 4 stars since labelling and pricing of items could be better, but I'd definitely return for a vegan baking fix."}
{"text":"I'm not gluten-free but they have some tasty desserts here. You can also get them at Pastoli's and Bethel Bakery."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I would not recommend their subscription box to anyone. When we first heard of the idea, we immediately wanted to get it for my grandmother for Christmas as she is celiac. We purchased 3 months and asked that it be shipped every other month (January, March, May) as she is only one person and can't eat it all by herself every month. We purchased until May with the intent to renew for her birthday on May 12th.  The March box got stuck at the post office for a week and no one from the bakery alerted us - when I called to inquire about where the box was - it was only then that they informed me it was stuck. The baked goods were stale and old by the time my grandmother received it. A handful of stale baked goods is not something I expect to pay almost $40 for! It is also extremely difficult to get ahold of anyone that is knowledgeable about the subscription program whether it be on the phone, in the bakery, or via email. I have had to email multiple times to get any response. Also, instead of sending the box in May like we had asked, they sent the box in April. We have since cancelled the subscription at the suggestion of my grandmother and will not be renewing the subscription for her birthday."}
{"text":"Ran in to try this place out with a friend last weekend. I am not on a gluten-free diet, but she is and adores this place, so I figure I'd give it a try with her. We purchased four macarons, two of each available flavor (chocolate cherry and peanut butter banana) as well as a sugar cookie. We had such a hard time deciding what to get because everything looked so great! We asked the staff for a recommendation and with only one question asked back to us we were able to make a decision. The staff is not only informed, but friendly! We struck up a conversation with the two on shift that day. It is worth noting that in addition to the daily menu of sweets available, there is a small retail section that sells dry mixes (brownie, pancake, cookie, etc) for people with dietary restrictions. 

Onto the good stuff:
Macarons: Fabulous. If you ask me, no different than the gluten and dairy filled kind. We deeply enjoyed both flavors, with the biscuits being just dry enough to perfectly balance the creme in the center. Wow! 
Cookie: Not only was this cookie delicious, but it looked like a cute snowflake! The quality of the dough was as you'd expect from a GF cookie, dense and crumbly, but ever so delicious.

My friend goes there often and we both highly recommend you try it out!"}
{"text":"Wonderful gluten free bakery.  I'm a big fan of their frosted brownie ( dont know its legitimate name but if you go... you;ll see it).  Also, i got one of their mini pumpkin pies for thanksgiving.... yeah the family loved it and raved about the crust for days.  
Staff are always very very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Just had my first gluuteny cupcake. Very good! This cupcake was vegan and I find that vegan baked goods tend to be try but it was quite moist. No big wow but I think it's much better than some of the more traditional bakeries on the street. I look forward to trying some of their other products."}
{"text":"My wife is lactose intolerant and loves chocolate.  She gave up on finding a good lactose free brownie until we walked into this little slice of heaven and walked out with the best walnut brownie she has ever devoured. I must get at least 2 brownies a week and while there, on occasion, I'll snag some sugar cookies with buttercream frosting for myself.  These are marvelous as well.  I also suggest the chocolate peanut butter cupcake.  I'm glad I'll only be living here for a year because any longer and the diabetes will have set in."}
{"text":"Just bought a cake for my friend from here for her birthday (and a pizza dough mix) and I absolutely loved it! I try to eat GF when I can and sometimes buying a dessert that is GF is always a bit nerve-wracking because often times they are terrible. I was pleasantly surprised! The only downfall is that it's pricey. The smallish, round cake was $40 and couldn't have served a lot of people, but it's definitely a recommendation!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!  The staff was friendly and offered samples to this GF gal!  I went on a weekday and I was the only one here!  The brownies were amazing!  They sell loaves of bread here, but unfortunately there is no bread slicer.  That's ok, I can survive!  I loved the cookies!  The cranberry orange muffins were more sweet, almost like cake!  Overall, a great experience!  I love the fact that I moved from Chi to Pittsburgh and was able to find a GF bakery so close!  YIPPEE!!!!  Yum...Yum....  Yummy in the tummy!  OK...so maybe I am high off the sweetness of the cran-orange muffin!"}
{"text":"Everything at this bakery looked amazing. It was so hard to make a decision but I ultimately picked an iced shortbread cookie. It was delicious, the perfect balance of chewy and sweet. 

If you are looking for gluten free baked goods. I would highly recommend this bakery. The woman working was so helpful and gave great advice on which items were her favorites. They also have a subscription box that looks awesome."}
{"text":"Best executed GF/vegan baked goods I have found in many cities and states. Cake is consistently moist, icing is well balanced, and they have great variety. Sure, it would be nice if they could accomplish the same great taste with 100% \"healthy\" ingredients in every single product, but they're not marketing themselves this way or hiding anything. In fact, the employees are always more than happy to answer an abundance of questions about ingredients and dietary concerns so you can choose the products with ingredients you're comfortable with. Every time I've been in here, there is at least one person who is experiencing the joy of having baked goods they can eat for the first time, and a friendly employee at the counter patiently and happily helping them think through which one to pick. 

This place simply makes the best tasting baked goods for people with special dietary needs, and they're doing a 5-star job of that."}
{"text":"This is a great bakery!  I've had several cupcakes, cookies, doughnuts and pizza crusts.  All very good and fresh.  I have gluten intolerance and these baked goods are the best I've had.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was pleased to happen upon this gem of a bakery while on a recent visit from Michigan. Pumpkin tarts, coffee cake, and whoopie pie were all AMAZING, and put a big smile on this gluten-free gal's face."}
{"text":"I got the cinnamon roll and it was a great vegan/gluten free substitute for the other kinds. Dough was a bit rough like you would expect from a gluten free item, but it was tasty enough. Tons of breads and pastries and such. Mostly all vegan, other than the pumpkin bread loaf or muffin (forgot which) and the white cupcake."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little shop. Immediately  we were greeted and the worker was quick to answer any questions we had with a smile. They have fresh baked goods and mixes to do it yourself. The prices are reasonable compared to normal gluten free products. I highly recommend this place, their finished products are amazing! Not to mention that we are from Indiana and they ship all over the US. Try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't know what exactly gluten is, but clearly you don't need it to make some of the most scrumptious baked goods I've ever tasted.

Going off tips from fellow Yelpers, I first tried a brownie. It was so rich and fudgy delicious I wish I would have bought more than one.  Thank goodness I still had a gob to enjoy. I decided to go with the mint creamy filling - definitely the right choice.  The gob was even better than the brownie.  Lastly I tried the chocolate chip cookies, despite mixed reviews.  They weren't my favorite thing, but they were still better than I expecteded, walnuts included. My only criticism would be the cookies could have used more chocolate chips.  But even so, the cookie were big and soft and perfect with a glass of milk.

I've recommended Gluttony to both vegan and meat-eating friends alike and I can't wait to go back myself."}
{"text":"I've been a Gluuteny Bakery fan for years. But I've noticed some changes over the years- probably from the business being sold. The warmth of the people isn't there anymore! I used to get a gluten-free pizza pocket and the ladies would offer immediately to warm it up so I could enjoy it right away. Not only have the pizza pockets gotten smaller, but the cashier looked as if I was asking her to make a custom pizza FOR me on the spot. I don't necessarily feel as welcome as I used to at Gluuteny."}
{"text":"I stopped into Gluteny and was amazed at the variety of sweet and savory goods in this small bakery.  I bought cookies, cakes, gobs, pizza pockets and brownies.  A very nice selection and there are also packaged baking mixes to make stuff at home.  Great place with friendly service and a great gluten-free selection."}
{"text":"Gluten, wheat, AND dairy free! It's so great to have this bakery as an option so everyone can enjoy delicious desserts. Absolute necessity.  The only thing is that it is a little more expensive than your average bakery."}
{"text":"I placed an online order be picked up in store for my wedding reception. Yet, it appears that the online ordering system sent emails to the bakery's spam email folder, so they never received my (and I believe to be other people's) order. Wow!

What's more, when I visited the store, the girl working at the counter was rude and patronizing. When she couldn't locate the order in the store, I assured her I placed the online order before noon the prior day, as recommended by the website. To this, she said, \"oh, well you actually need to place the order 48 hours in advance.\" Excuse me?

The order was to be ready the following day, and the girl asked if there was anything that could be done for my troubles. It would have been nice for them to deliver the order to the reception venue, given the inconvenience, but this was not offered. Instead, they threw in two extra cookies. Unfortunately, the cookies weren't really that tasty.

I won't shop there again."}
{"text":"Freshly prepared vegan and gluten free treats. Have been here multiple times and I love trying new things each time. The Vegan donuts are great especially the cinnamon almond donut. The service was great, Dylan Shaffer was well educated on all the options and gave me a great suggestion with the donut mentioned above."}
{"text":"Attractive shop, conveniently located in Squirrel Hill.  Not a lot of variety in fresh baked items and certainly quite expensive!  Can't recommend as a value,  though for people needing gluten free alternatives this may be an option."}
{"text":"Delicious! We got three pastries and they were all excellent. Highly recommend!!! 
The girl that helped us was really kind to and helpful with suggestions."}
{"text":"Due to my new (and luckily, temporary) diet, I have become a vegan who eats meat (i.e. dairy free). The most annoying part of this diet had been giving up sweets. No brownies, no cookies, no pies...the list goes on and on. That is, until I found Gluuteny. Let's be honest, most of the time when you hear gluten free and dairy free, you cringe. Most places just can't get it right. Sometimes it's the flavor, sometimes it's the texture but most of the time these type of sweet treats do not compare to their gluten, dairy filled counterparts. Until now. When I found Gluuteny, I decided to try a few options (brownies, cupcakes, lemon bar and chocolate chip cookies). I was blown away by the perfect flavor and texture of each of these desserts. I truly could not tell any difference between these desserts and others from a full gluten/ dairy using bakery. Yes, it's that good. Go here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have never, ever been let down by Gluuteny. I was there in line when it opened and now they offer maybe 3 or 4 times what they did then. I was diagnosed with celiac 15 years ago and I've been to gluten free bakeries near and far and nothing has ever come close to Gluuteny. The cupcakes are fluffy, substantial, and delicious, the double chocolate cookies are the perfect combination of crispy and chewy, and the seasonal gingerbread is awesome. I can't review everything because it would just be a list of their menu. AND the prices are super reasonable for gluten free baked goods. If you're in town, please stop by and buy everything you want."}
{"text":"I am extremely grateful for this bakery, mainly for the flour mixes (all-purpose, waffle, cake, etc) and pre-baked breads that I used for stuffings and such. However, I have found all of the desserts overwhelmingly sweet. I have tried the pumpkin cookies, brownies and the Yule Log, and I couldn't eat any of them. If you like insanely sugary things, you'll love them, but I couldn't make it through 2 bites. Just be aware of that. Otherwise, awesome stop for your gluten-free needs."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I'm super sensitive even to gluten cross-contamination, and can't have dairy, so it's amazing to have a place I can go without worrying. It's not only good if you're gluten-free though; my gluten-eating boyfriend loves this place. He says their cupcakes are the best. I'd say the only item that anyone could even identify as gluten-free would be the donuts. If you eat gluten, they may be too different for you, but I love em. The gobs and cookie sandwiches are awesome too. And the staff is super nice."}
{"text":"It is so hard to find good gluten free sweets. It's even harder to find a gluten free bakery with so many selections that ALL taste amazing! Their brownies and sugar cookies are amazing and their seasonal items are amazing. It's so much easier to be gluten free with this gem of a bakery in Squirrel Hill!!!"}
{"text":"Love their GF baked products....! Parking in squirrel hill can be quite scarce so you have to get here early. An ingenious concept, one of the only few exclusively GF bakeries in town ... must try !"}
{"text":"I have tested out a lot of Vegan and Gluten-free desserts over the last few years, and they can range from being terrible to great.  Gluuteny kind of falls right in the center quality wise for me, although they do fill a much needed void in Pittsburgh.  I came in here to test out some goods to decide if I should buy treats for my godmother here for the holidays.  I always taste test GF options before gifting because too often they are not good.

First, the staff is very friendly.  I tried a sample of a garlic cheddar bagel while making my selection, and while the garlic was a bit overpowering, it was pretty good in the scheme of GF goods.  I decided to order a double chocolate cookie ($3.99).  The price was skewed a touch high, but the cookie was very large.  It could easily be dessert after two or three meals.  The actual cookie was lacking in flavor, though.  There was a slight after taste, and the texture didn't quite line up.  The cookie was clearly covered in sugar, and I wonder what exactly is going into these cookies.  

Overall, it was OK, but I won't be purchasing any gifts here.  They do hit on my pet peeve of not marking prices, which is a real downer.  Also, it is unclear which options are vegan.  

$8 card minimum."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! Absolutely AMAZING! Will come back each and every time I am around! Reasonably priced and delicious! !! To be gluten and dairy free and be able to eat EVERYTHING in there was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Completely nasty, unhealthy ingredients no one should be eating, even in moderation.  Margarine, shortening with hydrogenated oil, preservatives, artificial flavors... you may as well eat Little Debbies and call your doctor to schedule your future heart surgery.  I have to say, at least they don't claim to be healthy, but slapping \"vegan\" on it obviously doesn't mean healthy.  Don't be fooled.  Also some cupcakes are severely dry.  Fail."}
{"text":"A nice gluten free and somewhat vegan bakery right in the heart of squirrel hill. The pastries here are really good! They have the tendency to be too sweet, but the ones I have had recently have all been perfect. The vegan brownies are serious some of the best vegan desserts I have ever had! They were chewy and not overwhelming with sweetness. Rich and flavorful. The chocolate donut was very good too but a little dry. The key lime cupcakes had really delicious frosting but was too sweet. I had to take my time eating!

The prices can be on the higher side. They can make you basically anything if you have a little time a money, which is cool. They have pastries in to-go packages. Sometimes they have little events with food other than desserts. So, in short:

Pros: yum, vegan, gluten free, flexible, friendly
Cons: expensive, too sweet, sometimes dry"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to take a day trip to Pittsburgh, and one of the first things I did was look up a gluten free bakery. Gluuteny popped up and I was convinced right away to make the trip over to Squirrel Hill. I bought a box full of treats, all gluten and dairy free, and was floored at how delicious everything was. My gluten full boyfriend was especially impressed with the brownie. The girl who helped us was super friendly (wish I had caught her name!) and even gave us a great lunch recommendation (Pastoli's Pizza, across the street). This was my first gluten free holiday season, and it was rough not being able to eat the many treats available this time of year. After my trip to Gluuteny, I definitely do not feel deprived! Will absolutely return next time I'm in town!!!"}
{"text":"Vegan donuts! I tried the chocolate and the vanilla. Very good, but don't expect a traditional donut. It's much heavier and cakier, but delicious!"}
{"text":"I went this weekend to see what kind of stuff they offered. They had a okay variety on hand. Cupcakes and cookies, some banana bread etc. I wasn't aware that full pies had to be ordered a day ahead so I was a little disappointed. I ended up buying a pizza pocket and a mini apple tart they had. Cost for both was $10. I warmed up my pizza pocket today and I was soooooo excited for it, when I cut it in half I was very disappointed. It was mostly bread. I had to eat it with butter because that's all I brought for my lunch. There was barely any cheese or pepperoni... the cashier was very informative and nice but I don't think I would go back again unless I wanted a full pie, that I'll call and pre order. But for the price (gluten in a tad pricier in general) this place was a little pricier then what I have found around town."}
{"text":"I love me some chocolate so I got a brownie worth walnuts and a chocolate scone with blueberries.

Way too rich and sweet for my palette. Couldn't go beyond a bite for either treat.
 
Disappointed since I was really hoping this would be my new sweet spot. Oh, well."}
{"text":"This bakery is amazingly delicious and creative with all the items they offer. For being gluten free it tastes incredible, highly recommend! Go go go!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I'm a celiac and there are so many things I miss (and my wife does too). Like cinnamon rolls! Which they had made for the first time in years when we stopped in while staying in Squirrel Hill for our 1st anniversary vacation.  Their cupcakes were some of the most moist I've had, EVER (that includes conventional baking too). The muffins were so tasty and moist. The brownie was so rich and gooey. We are lucky Austin doesn't have one of these or we'd spend all our extra money here.  Hooray for this Gluten Free heaven!!!"}
{"text":"I'm personally not gluten or dairy free but my niece is and I never have to hesitate when bringing her cupcakes or brownies. She doesn't have much of a sweet tooth but she loves the products here. Never had a bad experience, they are seriously underrated, one of the best bakeries in the city."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!! The gobs are amazing. We've used the pumpkin loaf mix and it was fantastic. We haven't been disappointed yet. :)"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise to find a gluten free bakery with delicious treats! It's pretty small inside with enough room to go in, order, and take your things to go. I had the apple cinnamon muffin, which was awesome! I'd go back just for that muffin alone. I also got a giant chocolate cookie that was pretty good as well. I was hoping they would have bread for purchase in the store but you can order it and have it made ahead of time. The staff was also very nice and helpful.

I can't wait to go back and try new things (and get another apple muffin)."}
{"text":"I ordered a small 6\" cake from Glutany for an office birthday since three of our 6 staff members are either vegetarian, vegan or gluten free.  I charged $35 to my boss' credit card and picked up the cake that morning.  When we tried to cut the cake at the party we could not get a sharp knife through the top edge of the cake.  Jokingly I tapped the knife on the edge of the cake and it made a thunking noise.  The top edge was hard as a rock and we could not cut through it easily with 3 different sharp knives.  The cake itself may have been palatable but that ruined it for me.  I called the bakery and left a voice mail telling them how disappointed I was with the quality of the cake, especially for the price but no one ever bothered to return my call.  I feel bad that my boss footed the bill for this cake that I made the decision to purchase from this bakery.  Needless to say, we will not make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Recently I recommended this place to my Sister, bc I had heard good things. She ordered a b day cake with very specific instructions which they agreed to. When we picked it up, it was a hot mess- with blue and gold ropes and white icing piped all over the place. Not the simple dark color, smooth chocolate she asked for. She told them then it was not to her liking, & they apologized. She tried to contact the owner in a second attempt for them to fix the issue. Again the same mgr apologized and that was it. Not good business for such a specialized market !
What has happened to customer service?
Never again, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Admittedly I do not normally eat gluten free, dairy free or vegan.  But had the opportunity to try some of the goodies at Gluuteny.  Could not believe how how good everything was!!!!   First of all, it looks amazing.  Like it should win cupcake wars and shows like that.  But the proof is always in the eating- right?!  Well. I would say this stuff rocks even if it wasn't gluten free or dairy free!!!   I tried cupcake, muffin, cookie, brownie, and this chocolate raspberry cream tart thing that was like heaven on a stick (without the stick).  The staff is super friendly and clearly has some amazing talent.  Do not miss this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I end up at Gluuteny every single time I visit Squirrel Hill because I want to love this bakery, and now that I've tried almost all their offerings in the way of prepared goods I can safely say, \"It's okay.\"  

Their brownies ($2.50) are the best thing they make in my book: they're better than most \"normal\" brownies. So good they don't taste gluten-free? Hell yeah, I'll make that claim!

The pumpkin and lemon loafs ($5) are addictive: I ate one small loaf in a day...by myself...and then I ate another one...don't judge me! The pumpkin tart ($2.50) is also really good.

The muffins ($2) come in blueberry, orange cranberry and chocolate chip, and are on the spongy side but their flavor is spot on. 

The cookies ($2), however, aren't done right; the sugar cookies are slathered in what can only be described as a suspicious amount of frosting. The other varieties, like chocolate chip and walnut chocolate chip, are just too crunchy to be enjoyable. What can I say? I like soft cookies.

If you're gluten-free this is a good place to stock up on pizza crust and pancake mixes, bread, muffins or any other pastry mix your heart desires; the lady in front of me bought fifty bucks worth of stuff!

The girls behind the counter that rock some of the cutest haircuts in all of PGH are willing to answer any questions or explain that you need to cook the pizza at a higher temperature to get the crust the right texture. Plus, you can order birthday cakes."}
{"text":"Gluuteny is absolutely amazing!!  I surprised my mom with a GF cake for her birthday.  I ordered online, and received a very prompt phone call, confirming my order, and processing my payment. The girl I spoke with super nice and friendly. Not only was the cake BEAUTIFUL, it was delicious.  My mom was so happy b/c she hasn't had an amazing piece of cake since her allergy diagnosis.  When we picked the cake up, we couldn't resist to get some cookies and other goodies.  All were so delicious. The gentleman behind the counter was great, he made suggestions, and was incredibly friendly.  I plan on ordering my pies for the holidays here too.  Even if you don't have an allergy, check out Gluuteny it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Impressed! 

I have a coworker who is gluten free, so yelp led me here. I confess I know nothing about gluten free baking and was very skeptical going in.  

I was shocked by the prices which is why I'm giving 4 stars.  I understand the extra effort that goes into developing these recipes, however 48 dollars for a small basic cake is outrageous.

Aside from the price, I felt the sweets were great! I purchased sugar cookies and cupcakes.  I didn't love the hard icing on the sugar coolers, but flavor was good.  The almond cupcake was my favorite!"}
{"text":"My husband and I purchased two small \"wedding cakes\" and some macarons (party favors) for guests at our wedding dinner who are GF. The cakes were gorgeous and the guests said they were incredibly delicious. One friend said this was the first macaron she had eaten in many years and she was now a huge fan of these little darlings. Thanks to Gluuteny for helping us to include our friends in our special day - you added a little gluten-free love to our dinner!"}
{"text":"Warning. 
THIS IS NOT A DYE FREE ESTABLISHMENT. This review is merely due our experience of the establishment, the lack of knowledge in the staff.....and my children having an allergic reaction as a result of their incompetence. 
We are new to the state, having moved  here 3 months ago, we've shopped this establishment 4 times and spent well over $400 total (bought for sons bday, bought just for enjoyment, and our large thanksgiving holiday party)
The place is expensive for sure, but a wonderful luxury. 
Or at least it WAS a wonderful luxury. 

The gf cookies are amazing (especially snickerdoodle) 
The $50 small cake is decent (got chocolate on chocolate) 
The donuts, well, don't waste your money (tastes like bland floury dough with confectioner sugar on top.)

Sent hubby to buy $100+ items for this thanksgiving. 
My 7&4 yr old have severe gluten and food coloring allergies. 
Hubby asked the seemingly experienced gentleman behind the counter if the sprinkles on the donuts were dye free. 
\"Yes they are all natural\" he stated \"No food coloring\". 
Claiming to be a baker and knowledgeable of the ingredients he stated dye free....Not once, but twice, to my concerned husband. Oddly enough when i called to speak to manager he stated he thought we were asking if the actual DONUT itself (wkth red dye #40 sprinkles in top) was color free. 
Scratching your head too? Join the crowd. 

Hubby orders two \"all natural\" sprinkle donuts for my two INTENSELY EXCITED boys who rarely get this sort of treat. 

When he came home, i noticed the donut sprinkles didn't appear to be dye free, simply by looking at the abnormally bright sprinkles that were neon. 
Dammit why do i trust my husband!! 
Apparently a deficiency in the male dna for sure bc there's a connection that hubby and male ding dong  behind the counter ....but i digress.......By the time i noticed , my 7 yr old had already slammed his and my 4 yr old was halfway through. 
Noooooo!!!! 
(Watching My sons bouncing off the walls a half hour later was truly all the proof i needed). 
I immediately threw out the donuts and Called gluuteny to voice concerns with the voice on other end stating abruptly, \"oh yup. They do have food dye. Sorry for misunderstanding. Have a nice day\".click. 
Huh?! 
So i Called back and asked to speak to manager. Oddly enough, Julie the manager had the same voice as the abrupt, uncaring employee just moments prior who hurriedly hung up-although Julie denied being the same person. 
Oh well. 
So After an apology and an \"ok i refunded you for your two sprinkle donuts anything else?\"
Uuuuh. Yea. How about a gift card to keep such a loyal customer who raves about the establishment to all of my husbands hopital colleagues? Or SOMETHING more enticing than \"hey sorry your  kids are having an allergic reaction and here's your $10 back for the donuts that ended up in the trash for raccoons to eat\"

Eek. Good thing they don't run an establishment where serious allergies are involved. 
Oh wait......

Signed, 
irritated parents who are ready to drop our amped up sons off at gluuteny bakery for the next couple hours as we relax at home to let ding dong baker handle them."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the dirtiest bakeries I have ever been in... flies in January??  Not to mention their subpar super expensive products! My wife and I got a brownie and it was so stale I almost broke a tooth! The Gluten free Goat is way cleaner and the food is actually worth the price . Only go here if you want to go to the dentist...or better yet had them a mop!"}
{"text":"This bakery is absolutely adorable and has a huge selection of delicious sweet treats to choose from! The day I went, I got the last chocolate donut with chocolate icing and it was very good. I also got a pumpkin cupcake and that was really good as well. Will definitely be back to try more goodies! Highly rec!"}
{"text":"If you like brownies be sure to try theirs! It was the best brownies we've ever had!! We also tried the smores cupcake, it was outstanding!!"}
{"text":"This place uses a TON of sugar in their products. Everything I got tasted like I was eating sugar by the spounful. This was the only flavor I picked up and it got sickening real quick. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic. A true miracle I can have baked goods. 
Always friendly staff and delicious items that change slightly with the seasons. 
Brought a cupcake for my friend's wedding when her caterer neglected her allergy."}
{"text":"I've bought some of their items at Sorgels in Wexford- but came to the bakery to check it out. Yes-- hands down besttt brownines ever. But the rest of their items are, to me, not very good-- very very sweet. I had a blueberry muffin (good but very sweet), I tried the pumpkin roll- again good but sweet and I had the double chocolate cookie- yuck- was not good. If you want a little something sweet go for the brownie but I wouldn't be placing big orders for parties or anything. Sugar cookies are ok."}
{"text":"My husband and I are cooking gluten free/dairy free right now, and we can't say enough good things about Gluuteny.  Even with all the new products that are available, living GFDF can be exhausting.  Not only does Gluuteny make it easy, they make it DELICIOUS!!!

The chocolate chip cookies here are to die for -- even better than most non-GFDF cookies!!!  The brownies are great too.

I hate almost all GFDF bread, but their white bread is quite good.  We slice it up, freeze it, and use it for our sandwich lunches all week.

I love that they make sell mixes.  We buy the mixes so that we can make up our own GFDF treats whenever we want!

If you're unsure about something, ask them for a free taste.  They're super cool about samples.  However, you don't need one.  Just trust me.  Everything rocks!!!"}
{"text":"So I came here when I initially moved and was told they didn't have anything vegan.  So sad.  So after Vegan Pittsburgh gave this place a sticker I finally decided to come back.  I'm not sure if I should write Vegan Pittsburgh a thank you letter or a hate letter because this place is SOOOO addictively good.  When you go in it's best to ask what their vegan offerings are and about half of their offerings are usually vegan.  If they have the chocolate hostess I would recommend that one.  It's my absolute fav.  My gf is partial to the vanilla almond cupcake.  Also, if you're a fan of Mexican wedding cookies they have REALLY good ones here.

Bottom line: Great taste but not so great for calories."}
{"text":"Hallelujah, there is a new option for all the GF (gluten-free) folks in Pittsburgh! I went to the grand opening today, and waited in line with many other eager customers to try to goodies available at the new bakery. Today was the first day of business, so I will cut them some slack for a bumpy start (there was a very large turnout of customers!). Nevertheless, the owners and staff were VERY friendly and eager to please customers (they gave out samples and chatted with customers who waited patiently). I had a chance to sample some delicious GF/WF cupcakes and delicious chocolate chip cookies. I bough two loaves of fresh-made GF bread (still warm from the oven), and the prices aren't too bad. Things aren't cheap, but the cost is fair, considering the dietary benefit. The bakery is small, but it looks like Gluuteny will be putting out some fantastic GF products (special order cakes, pies, pound cakes, cupcakes, bread, cookies, etc). Whether you are on a GF diet or not, this is a great place to stop by for a treat! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you need to eat gluten free then this is the place for you. It's really a grab and go bakery but they sell cakes, muffins, loaves, etc. Just about you name it. They now have vegan choices on some of their items which have a small letter \"v\" next to it.

I was looking at the almond raspberry cupcake. The counter lady told me it was made using applesauce as opposed to eggs. I got one and was delighted to find that it had a raspberry preserve filling just to give it enough flavor. Course at $3.95 one would expect to pay more for both gluten free and vegan. I decided to eat it there and was pleased with the taste and that it was not too filling.

You can order cakes here but I wasn't real interested in that. Nice place to come to if you find yourself on Murray Ave in Squirrel Hill. Located near the Giant Eagle I am glad to find another place that offers both gluten free and vegan options for grab and go."}
{"text":"The bakery from here is simply hands-down excellent. We get it catered to work regularly, and I often prefer it to the in-house gluten+dairy options.

The muffins, cookies, and donuts (though they don't look great) are fantastic. I'm so excited for a celiac relative to come to town so I can take her to this place."}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the best brownies I've ever eaten. Cupcakes are great too. Not a huge fan of their breads - mostly because GF bread generally doesn't do it for me. 

The store has a friendly staff, reasonable prices, and quality GF mixes to take home if you like to bake.

Thankful that Gluuteny exists."}
{"text":"I got a package from Heidi herself, recently. I had, had surgery so this was a \"Get Well Soon\" package to be exact. Inside were these beautifully packed Macaroons, which she knows I adore. I receieved:

1. Mint Chocolate
2. Peanut Butter and Jelly 
3. Raspberry Hazelnut
4. Blackberry Pomegranate. 

Oh my Lawrd they were absolutely devine, and fresh! I don't like Mint desserts but I enjoyed the Mint macaroon (it had a rich chocolate center! haha). The PB&J was an Ah-Mah-Zing fix for when we just need that peanut butter bite. The Rasberry Hazelnut was subtle and refreshing in its flavor as it welcomes that hint of Hazelnut. But the star of the show was the Blackberry Pomegranate. Ima be blunt, it tasted like the Capt Crunch Crunch Berries, which I absolutely adore!!! None were too sweet, or too tart; they were just right. 

To top it all off, I live in Brooklyn, NY and Heidi's shop is in PA. She took special care to package these little pieces of heaven, seeing how each individual macaroon had it's own protective layer, plus multiple layers of bubble wrap. Perfect condition upon arrival. I added 2 photos, with jadedgemini14 as the watermark. 

I never thought I'd have to buy my snacks online but Heidi convinced me otherwise. I can't wait for my next order!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the baked goods look better than they taste. I found the donuts to be bland and the texture was completely dry. Absolutely nothing like how a donut should taste. On top of that, the prices are unreasonably high. $3.09 for a teeny tiny donut is excessive - especially since the quality is not great. 

If you're looking for delicious gluten-free desserts, I would recommend Gluten Free Goat. Unfortunately the prices are comparable but the donuts are phenomenal."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! 

Personally, I don't have a gluten, dairy or soy allergy but I can appreciate these treats! The bakery is adorable and the staff is super nice. 

So far I've had the themed sugar cookies, pumpkin cookies, cupcakes, cookie sandwich and the brownies. They're all delicious! They honestly taste like normal sweets! (Meaning having gluten and dairy.) My favorite are the brownies! They're soooo good! They have a crunchy outside but a super soft and moist center. 

Check this wonderful bakery out!"}
{"text":"I can only speak to their brownies, but what I can say is that you would never ever know they are gluten free! They're ooey, they're gooey and they're goooood! I wish I could say they were also \"healthy\" but hey, we can't have it all!

I don't need to be gluten free but I will happily come in and try any and all sweets from them! Good to know that they also make pre-packaged mixes you can take home to make on your own. 

You know those sweets you've had that are gluten free and you can totally tell something is missing? Don't worry, that will not happen here! You'll never miss it!

It's a tiny little storefront, but it's got a ton of flavor packed in it!"}
{"text":"I just stopped by for the first time yesterday.  I bought three vanilla cupcakes, three chocolate cupcakes and six beautifully decorated sugar cookies.  I decided to try gluten free desserts just to see if we would like it.  All of us were blown away by how everything tasted.   You really didn't think there was any difference between gluten and non-gluten.   This is a first class, top notch bakery and we loved everything we bought."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the Thursday before Easter when we were in Squirrel Hill for dinner.  We had plans to go to a friend's house after dinner for drinks so I thought that it would be a nice idea to bring some dessert.  We purchased an assortment of 4 cupcakes (red velvet, classic yellow with chocolate icing, vegan chocolate, and a vegan chocolate hostess), a package of 3 sugar cookies that were decorated for Easter, and a small, 2-serving glazed bundt cake.  As others have mentioned, the prices are not listed anywhere so we had to ask the employee how much each item cost so that we could budget our purchases and even with that we spent  $28 which was maybe a little pricey but expected given the location and specialty of gluten-free desserts.  

When we arrived at my friend's house, we cut the cupcakes into 4 sections so that everyone could have a taste.  I found them to be too sweet and very dry.  It seemed that in order to make up for the lack of animal products and gluten they use a lot of sugar and unhealthy ingredients, which was disappointing along with how dry the cupcakes and the bundt cake were.  We ate the 3 sugar cookies over the weekend and again, the cookies were extremely dry as were the cupcakes and overly sweet so it felt like it wasn't even worth the calories to eat something so sugar laden that didn't satisfy because of the lack of moisture.  I think that it is great that they offer some vegan and all gluten free products, but I have had better from Whole Foods and other local small bakeries and have made healthy versions myself with high quality ingredients that were moister and less laden with sugar.  It's unlikely that I will return when there are other bakeries in the area that do a better job or when I can make it myself in a healthier way."}
