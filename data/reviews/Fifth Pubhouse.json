{"text":"I came here on a friday night with a group of 8 friends. We had made a reservation. 

The table we got was a bit odd, a very large square and there was no way for the server to get from one side of the table to the other without walking halfway around the restaurant.  

The service was really good though, especially since we were a large group.   We ordered drinks and apps to start. We had a calamari, poutine and ploughman's board.  They were all delicious.  For dinner I had a burger and fries and my husband had the osso bucco which was surprisingly good for a pub. They have a great beer selection and my party tried quite a few of them.

At the end of our meal the server was easily able to split our bill for us, even though we hadn't asked that at the beginning.  Great service.

Overall I'd say this is a great place to come for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Though a little on the pricy side, this is a fantastic pub for hanging out with friends.  It's a nice laid back atmosphere which still looks clean and classy.  The staff are very nice, and the food is pretty great!  I highly recommend the burger - delicious!"}
{"text":"Decent, but just a few nitpicks.

I ordered a burger cooked medium. I think medium normally has some red on the edges, but this was entirely pink except for the thin sear. Not a big deal, but 8oz of rare/med-rare ground beef gets a bit grimey for my likeing. Sort of like a big, wet, mushey mess of ground beef. I think a 6oz patty would have cooked up better.

I was pretty sure the menu suggested my beer would be draft, but it was in a can. The website beer menu suggests the same (Old Tomorrow CPA if you would like to see what I mean). Again, not a huge deal but I prefer draft.

Fries were delicious, and the burger was served with a tangy house sauce that I liked.

Server was nice as well. Ill go back, but not for the burgers."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and nachos after work.  Must try the Chirizo Nachos with some Guac."}
{"text":"An interesting and tasty rendition on the sheppard's pie as the mince included bacon and olives. 
We were also able to sample the whoopie pie for free with our yelp check in and we were given day end pastries from the cafe as we left. 
I loved the log cabin decor and suggest this venue for a pre-theatre or movie dining location."}
{"text":"Popped into the Fifth GastroPub as my friend had never been and I definitely wanted to try the new menu I had heard about. 

We definitely were not disappointed!  Shared some apps...Tempura Pickles, Crab Cakes and the Sliders. All were delicious  

We followed that up with the Beef Bourguignon and the Burger. The burger was cooked to perfection and soooo good. The beef bourguignon was to tender and tasty...I wanted to devour that all by myself but was forced to share :(

Deb and I also shared a bottle of Pinot Grigio which was very reasonably priced and was so good we followed up with another glass.  

If you haven't been for awhile definitely go in and check out the new menu. 

Great atmosphere, loads of TV's if you want to watch a game and tons of beer on tap to satisfy anyone's beer drinking preference. 

All in all a great night and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was really slow. Waited 60m for fish and chips... Wasn't even good. Tasted like frozen food."}
{"text":"Do order: tempura pickles, gnocchi, burgers

Don't order: CAESAR SALAD!!! (The dressing tastes like miracle whip)
& nachos (just not great) 

Atmosphere and service was great, drinks were pretty good."}
{"text":"Great service. Super friendly staff. Ambience excellent. We ordered the nachos with added pulled pork, fish tacos, and tempura pickles...we were not disappointed! Also the pints are so reasonably priced! Our new regular hot spot!"}
{"text":"Came here on a crazy Jay's playoff night. Even though it was rowdy and wild for a Wednesday night, our awesome male server ensured that drinks were always flowing. Service was super top notch. 
They have quite a large selection of menu items to choose from- but it being a craft beer and bad-for-you foods kind of night, I went with the wings. Not bad! Tasted even sweeter paired with Baustista's badass bat flip."}
{"text":"Great service, nice menu (poutine is tasty), good choice of drinks (forget the green beer, go for classic one), i appreciate the variety of the sitting, small to large tables in addition to the bar. 

Definitely a good place for after-works being in the core financial district."}
{"text":"Went here for a party not long ago and while the place isn't bad, I'm not sure I would go back often.

The space downstairs is rather small and bathrooms are hard to navigate once more than two people enter the room. The bar feels a little too big for the amount of stuff behind it and I would be surprised if they couldn't do just as good a job with half the counter length. The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was fine.

My big complaint, and really only complaint, I had the worst Old Fashioned I've ever had here. Being an ex-bartender, I don't expect much from bartenders in this town. Toronto is not known for its cocktail culture or its prize winning bartenders. That is changing, finally, but more often than not you're going to end up in a place where the bartender can't make a real drink to save their lives even if you walk them through the process. Sadly, the Fifth was this kind of place. Stick to beer and simple drinks and you'll be just fine."}
{"text":"Brand new place, good atmosphere. Food of fthe grill is great, sliders, steak, burger etc. Great service, Jocelyn was our server and she was super friendly and nice. Overall excellent place I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm on the email list for JP Challet's The Fifth which is a well reviewed Entertainment District foodies restaurant.  The Fifth has been a foodies destination for years.  Recently I received an email announcing a new \"Classic French bistro menu for JP Challet's 5th GastroPub\".  With JP Challet at the helm, how wrong could you go?  Turns out you can go terribly wrong.  Dinner was a disaster.  We should have known when we walked in and saw it was more a sports bar than a pub.  It was filled with people whose average age was 25-30.  It was VERY noisy.  We should have known when we had to inform our waiter that the restaurant had a corkage policy.  He told us that we were the first to bring wine in his 2 1/2 years working there.  Our appetizers were very good.  We had deep fried calamari and deep fried chicken chunks called popcorn chicken.  Both had a light tempura-like batter and both were perfectly cooked. A promising beginning.  Things began to go wrong when we ordered our mains.  At 8p they were already sold out of the daily feature Duck Confit.  Instead we ordered other Bistro classics - Coq Au Vin, Boeuf Bourgignon and Steak & Frites.  The Coq Au Vin and Steak & Frites were almost inedible.  The Coq au Vin was served atop soggy gnocchi.  The chicken was barely recognizable.  The orders of steak were tiny, over-cooked and chewy.  The frites were soggy and lukewarm.  The Boeuf Bourgignon had to be sent back to the kitchen to be warmed up.  When it was returned piping hot it turned out to be the only main that rated a \"good\".  Our waiter was very professional and worked very hard.  He brought us a couple of free desserts to compensate for our obvious disappointments.  My only comment is that dessert is also not a strength at JP Challet's GastroPub.  There are lots of downtown French bistros where the food is very good.  JP Challet's GastroPub just isn't one of them.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Saturday evening and we were seated right away!.The decor was nice,  very homey feel. I ordered the burger and fries. The fries were skinny in size they could have been perfect, but they were too salty. The burger was good. Nothing bad to say, just it was good. Toppings are an extra $2 each(cheese, onions, avocado)$15+$2 for a slice of avocado. My Boyfriend had the fish and chips, again fries were so salty! The fish is haddock and was very good.$15. 4 Steam Whistle  beers were $32. Total dinner $64 before taxes. If in that area again we will check out other options for dinner."}
{"text":"Prices for drinks were very reasonable, especially for downtown area. Their food I found was really good, but the portions were a bit small in general. Would recommend their Kaba and Pretzels. Generally a very quiet scene between Monday-Thursday, so if you were looking for a place that has TVs and is not too crowded, this is the place to be. Friday, considering that the area is usually pretty crazy, expect it to be crowded. They also have a large selection of liquor/scotch."}
{"text":"I'd rate my Summerlicious experience here a 3/5. The starter (haloumi cheese and falafel salad) was delicious. I would have been perfectly content eating that as my main course - the portion was quite generous for a starter. Main course (mac and cheese) was disappointing. I prefer my noodles to be softer and the sauce extra cheesy. Overall it was just lacking in flavour. Dessert (chocolate mousse) was yummy. I found the whole decor/atmosphere confusing. I was expecting traditional pub decor, but instead there were deer antlers and portraits of chickens everywhere. The music kept flip flopping between country classics and Frank Sinatra/Ray Charles. Just bizarre."}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday and had an awesome burger.  It was perfectly cooked medium rare, with cheddar, crispy bacon and fresh lettuce and tomato on a tasty bun.  The fries it came with were also delicious and our server was extremely attentive and friendly.  It wasn't overly busy but they had a bunch of big televisions showing the leafs game which my friends enjoyed.  Overall a solid experience - I will be back"}
{"text":"Shortly after my previous review, the Fifth contacted me to redeem the horrible experience.

Although the food was still slow, everything else was great. Service was extra attentive but the pace was not fast enough for a 'lunch' rush. I'm sure the Fifth would be great on a weekend when nobody is in a rush to get back to work, but it's certainly not the quick fix I look for during my one-hour lunch break. 

Soup arrived first this time! The French onion soup we ordered was delicious, and served in a large cauldron-like bowl. It wasn't too salty and subtly contained the taste of onions, in which I'm grateful! 

My fish and chips were also delicious! The fish tasted fresh and the batter was extra crispy. The portion of the fries this time was significantly increased and the individual slices of potatoes are now visible compared to the burnt pile last time. 

I really appreciated the nice gesture from the Fifth to invite us back - this shows that they do care about customer service/feedback. I'll be back to try out other items on the menu, but just not during my lunch break."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers have pointed out. Everything is an average. Average menu average food and average service. 

I was here on a Friday night, party of 3. I was surprised to find out there was no line up for a table at 7:15pm, peak hour of dinner services.

Friday night has a special of $6 pint of creemore. Menu choices are adequate, the normal kind of pub food you could get. Fish and chips, wings, burgers... And so on

I ordered a lb of wings, $14, it was NOT breaded at all... they look small and skinny :( I wish they let customers pick breaded or not. I would be happier if I were given a choice, at least?

Overall, it's an enjoyable experience.  Neat and clean mediocre restaurant. But there's nothing remarkable going on here. Would I come back? Probably not...  I hope the one day the owners could be a bit more creative with their menu to gain repeating customers :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

This place is nice. The ambience is cozy, warm and even a little romantic. The service was great; our waitress was highly attentive and accommodating. Throughout the night, we spoke to some of the other servers and they were all incredibly friendly. The dress code seemed a little more on the casual-business casual side, but there's nothing strictly enforced so you could probably get away with most attires. 5/5 

The live music on Saturday nights was great! We didn't even have to pay cover to get into the bar despite that. I'm a sucker for venues that do live music, so this is an automatic 3 stars *at least* in my books. We had a great time requesting music and shout outs from the singer - it felt very personal and again, so friendly! That experience alone: 5/5 

The atmosphere was somewhat, but not completely, dead. I don't particularly like joints that are packed to the brim, but this was a little more empty than it was full. I'm going to go ahead and say that's because it's a fairly new pub that opened up in a district that's littered with nightlife options. I hope it does pick up, because it would have made for a livelier experience and this seems like a bar I would come back to. I'm docking points off here for that, however, it should be noted that my friends and I still had a great time despite that. I believe the fallback of this place is that it really doesn't offer anything unique, and although I enjoyed myself, the overall experience didn't stand out for me. I can see they've put in efforts to distinguish themselves (ice alley, live music), but it still needs a little more work and perhaps a little more time. 3.5/5 

Note: during the winter months, they seem to have an ice alley out back that is shared amongst their other 'Fifth' establishments. When we went, it was quite dead. They had a bar set up, and promoted Stoli vodka, that they \"chilled\" by pouring it through an ice sculpture in front of you. The idea was cool, but the chilling didn't exactly work. When we were leaving around 1am, the entire alley way was packed to the brim! I supposed this was from their club next door - the ice alley worked out as sort of an outdoor bar/patio, complete with flame torches to warm you up. Pretty neat, but could use some work. 

The prices were decent, but I wouldn't call it exactly cheap. They were regular bar prices, maybe a $1 or so more. I didn't have to break the bank or anything to spend here, but it was also not the cheapest place I've ever been. 3.5/5 

Now, this is where a lot of the points for the overall rating kind of got docked off. I'm a huge foodie, so good food at an establishment is always something that really makes it or breaks it for me. I hated the food here! After seeing all the Yelp reviews rave about the food, I expected a lot better. Our nachos were a medium sized portion, I think the price point could have been $1 or 2 less considering the amount. They also had no option (that I know of) to add meat to it. Furthermore, they tasted quite bad! I didn't enjoy them one bit, even after several glasses of beer. The onion rings were far too oily-tasting and the fries were just average. Nothing to write home about. That being said, those were the only 3 items we tried, and perhaps the other items were better; also, we ordered right at last call. Their stock ale was actually also quite good to my standards. Considering that: 2/5 

The bar itself has a lot of potential and given the live music and friendly atmosphere, I would definitely return! I can definitely get over the fact that it wasn't very full on a Saturday night; as long as I have good company, there's no issue. The ice alley was also a nice touch, although it could have been executed better - but that's not to say it was terrible, and the effort was appreciated. To be honest, the food really killed it for me. This place would definitely be a 4.5 stars (I rarely give out 5 stars, that's why) instead of a 3.5 had it not been for the disappointing food. Perhaps next time, I'll order something else! 

Regardless, I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last night to watch the Raptors/Nets game.  When we arrived I asked if we could sit at the bar and maybe have an appetizer.  The hostess informed us (a couple) that the bar was full and then asked if we had a reservation.  I pointed out three empty two-top tables and asked if we could sit at any one of those.  The hostess checked and abruptly brought us to the table.  There was no energy or courtesy after just telling us the restaurant is full.

Fast forward 20 minutes and no one has taken our order for drinks, said hi to us or anything.  We are offered nachos by a waiter (not our order since we haven't ordered and do not even have water) and ask them if they can help us.  5 minutes later what I can only assume is the manager asks us what we want - no apology, no energy, and he was definitely not friendly.  We order two manhattans ($12 each), water, and bruschetta.

10 minutes later we have our drinks but no water.  The bartender brought us our drinks.  40 minutes later and we still do not have the bruschetta BUT have been offered nachos and fish and chips two more times since the food runner cannot seem to figure out which tables get us.  We stop the manager asking and he brusquely replies, \"I saw the ticket in the kitchen and he will check.\"  Still no bruschetta,  we flag down a friendly female waitress who literally brings it out 30 seconds later.  Either it was sitting there for ages or all it is is bagel crisps with spooned tomatoes - either way, nothing to write home about and it should not have taken an hour.

When we asked for the check, no surprise it took awhile to receive and then 10 minutes for the bubbly blonde waitress to return.  She did nothing wrong except it was too little too late,  In the end we receive $1.00 off the check for the delay but we have been there from 7:00pm to 8:45pm and never even order dinner, which was the intention.

i am very disappointed because my boyfriend and I just moved around the corner and we were looking for a local spot to come to regularly.  The Fifth Pub House fails at that."}
{"text":"I got really excited when I first walked into this pub. I thought the environment was cool and the vibe was laid back. Unfortunately, the service was terrible - I don't know if they were understaffed or what, but I waited a good 30 minutes after my meal to receive and pay the bill. The burger I ordered was fine but the lettuce was just a hunk of iceberg that made it difficult to eat. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Aww, I remember this place from my youth.  Ahh, youth.  The difference of now is that I came here for lunch. 

If you enjoy Gruyère, definitely try the croque madame.  Absolutely stuffed with ham piled to about 2.5 inches high, slathered with dijon mustard, layered with a bit of bechamel sauce, smothered in a crust of melted aforementioned cheese, then topped with a perfectly fried, gooey-yolked duck egg...you'll thoroughly enjoy the experience.  If, however, you've come to realize that Gruyère is less than liked: avoid this pick.  

Seriously, I thought I liked Gruyère until it suddenly hit me that it tastes like really bad breath mixed with a sweaty old sneaker.  That's totally personal preference though and totally unrelated to The Fifth's kitchen skills.

The side of fries, added for $3, were yummy.  Shoestring style, lightly sprinkled with rosemary bits and dusted with sea salt, you can ask for some aioli on the side.  

Prices were reasonable and you can get away with lunch for roughly $18.
We had no difficulties getting a spot for 8 at noon.  A decent pick for a Finance District lunch."}
{"text":"My experience is exactly just that: okay, overall still an enjoyable night, but nothing to get too excited about or memorable enough to tell you to come again.

Food: Average, portions on smaller end but filling enough. 

Service: Nice server, but not that attentive. Service was real slow despite not being packed on a Friday night (~3 hours for the entire course of the meal, with 1 hour being waiting for the food after we ordered).

Ambience: Nice decor with high tables, casual environment. 

We ate here for a friend's birthday as we wanted to party at The Fifth Social Club after. You get FREE entry (normally $15) to Fifth Social Club if you eat here for $35 pre-tax/tip OR $30 on a Friday/Saturday if you CHECK-IN ON YELP. I found this requirement to still be on the expensive side as many of my party members, including myself, normally wouldn't have ordered $30 pre-tax/tip for our meal here (I ordered more than I normally eat, for example).

I ordered:

1) Mac n Cheese ($14) - sounded better on paper (ie. fancy) than in actual taste. Very cheesy, which is good but also extremely heavy. 

2) Baked cremini mushrooms ($5) - quite heavy like a paste. Thought it would be more refreshing and juicy whole mushrooms, not gritty.

3) Berry Cosmo cocktail ($12) - taste was alright, kind of small which was disappointing. Perhaps this is the norm?

The kicker was The Fifth was too packed that night, so even though we ate here, we did not get any priority to get in and the waiter had a misunderstanding and sent us to the club next door (Cabin Nine). We ended up pleading our case and got into Fifth 1.5 hours later, but that goes to show that even if you're a customer, that does not make you a priority.

For a $45ish meal, could be better. I would not come back again just to eat unless it was a special occasion like a birthday where you actually want to go The Fifth Social Club after."}
{"text":"This is a laid back bar that's totally Canadian. They have board games and comfy couches to chill at while you drink. The bar service is slow and not very attentive, but everyone is very kind. The whisky sour was delicious, I recommend not skipping the egg white the traditional prep is very respectable here."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a quick bite and the service was horrible. We were waiting for 10 minutes at our table until our waitress came. She seemed to be having a bad day or just tired but she was very inattentive and was not helpful at all to pick our menu. 

The food was a bit pricey for what it was, but not much to complain"}
{"text":"this place is LOUD. when the live music is on, expect difficultly in conversing with someone sitting right next to you, and you better brush up on your charades and lip reading skills for anyone sitting across from you at one of the big tables. service was sparse (Friday nights are understandably busy) but attentive, and they were happy to accommodate a birthday cake we had brought in externally. they are every light handed in their sprinkling of toppings on the tortilla chips -- a sad excuse for nachos, really. 

this isn't a top pick, but it gets the job done for being a centrally located, reasonably priced watering hole to watch the game."}
{"text":"Great service, poor food.

Burger left a strange bitter taste in my mouth. Not sure why... Too many onions?"}
{"text":"We needed a low key, place for dinner, this place fit the bill perfectly and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. The wait staff was excellent, helpful and attentive. I'd be remiss, if i didn't mention the ricotta garlic gnocchi, my wife raved about it for days."}
{"text":"Had lunch on the patio here on the last day of TIFF. The patio is quite nicely secluded. We had burgers which were fine. Service was friendly but a bit slow. However we were the only ones braving the cooler temperature of the patio so that may have been why things were a bit slow."}
{"text":"When you walk in from the street you have to go downstairs, below The Fifth Grill & Terrace. After arriving at the host stand you can go to the right side for the cafe or to the left side for pub/restaurant. Our bouncy, chipper host quickly took us to our table and assured us that our server would be over shortly.

I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant. It has a very casual yet sophisticated feel. I like the mix of high top tables with high chairs that have backs and the low tables with with short bar stools. The menu was limited because they just opened so everything available was indicated by a red dot next to the name of the item.  We had the tempura pickles for an appetizer. They were served hot and delicious (mixture of pickle spears and pickle chips) with 2 sauces. One was a mayo, lemon, chive dip and the second was a hot spicy tomato dip. Both were really good. 

For dinner I had the sweet potato gnocchi (which was spelled wrong in the menu) served in a hot healthy portion in a tomato basil sauce that looked and tasted homemade. The dish was yummy but the sweet potato flavor was a little too subtle for me, I would've liked to taste a stronger sweet potato flavor but that's just my preference. There was an option to add homemade meatballs but I decided to stick with the regular. If I get those again the next time (because there will be a next time) I will try it with the meatballs. This might just be my preference but I felt like the dish was missing a little piece of garlic toast to go along with the other flavors.

 My fiance got the braised beef sandwich, which I had a bite of and it was delicious. It came with ketchup and a coleslaw that looked to be made of red cabbage and vinegar. It was tasty. She asked him what side he wanted and he picked fries, but we didn't find out until the bill came that the fries were $3 extra. We barely ate any fries and wouldn't have ordered them if we knew they were extra.

There were 3 big TVs behind the bar and I liked that during the game, the music continued to play in the background instead of the audio for the game because it helped to keep an intimate dinner intimate while still being able to look up and check the score. That might not have been intentional since there were a lot of people watching the game but I think it helped to prevent the atmosphere from turning into a sports bar. There were plenty of bar stools as well and what looked to be about a dozen beers on tap.

Now for the service. Our server was very friendly and explained the menu well. She also answered any questions we had. The servers there carry around what looks like a mini iPad, so that as you're ordering your meal, she stands tableside and immediately sends your order. Pretty cool. Our drinks and each course of our meal came out quickly (the restaurant was less than 25% full) and very hot and fresh! Our server did a nice job keeping our water glasses full and our table clutter-free. I did ask about wi-fi because I saw on my phone \"fifthcafe-guest\" with a strong signal. She gave me what she thought was the password but it didn't work. She apologized and said she'd ask around for me, but I never got an update. In her defense though, I didn't ask about it again because our food started arriving so I wasn't concerned with it.

Instead of dessert, which I wish I had room for, I got a cup of coffee which was really good. I would hope so since they're attached to the cafe. I just wish that I could've had the coffee drink options of the cafe available to me on the pub side, but o well. I'll just have to go again but to the cafe side. A glance over there looked like there might have been some 

Overall I really liked the"}
{"text":"Regular menu is in line with downtown pub prices. Good food selection but most importantly, good daily specials. Buck a shuck oysters on Tuesdays and $4 select shots every day. I come mainly for trivia nights on Wednesdays. Dan and Joe are fantastic and funny! Its great entertainment on a Wed night. Could have a better beer selection but not bad. Some decent 'craft' beers on tap. The atmosphere does tend to be on the loud side. Lots of board games/nintendo 64 games/ and chill vibes."}
{"text":"A group of around 8 of us came on Saturday for drinks. I loved that the space had a Canadian feel. There's lots of tables to accommodate big groups. The sangria was excellent. It was pretty empty for a Saturday night. We were there from around 10:00-1:00. There was a Blingo event happening which our group did not enjoy that much. The humour was a cringe and made us feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"My 2nd and final meal here...the service is pathetic...arrived at 6:45 on a Saturday night...place is 80% empty...service was glacial...settling the bill took forever...

Food was mediocre...friend had the Haloumi salad which came with \"Falafel\" that looked more like a hunk of charcoal than food (and was uneaten)...my burger was forgettable...

Ordered burger without special sauce, tomato, pickle or lettuce and yet ended up with a fifty cent charge for mustard...regular yellow mustard....

So many better options, I would be surprised if this place is in business in a year."}
{"text":"I came here on Thursday night with a large group and had a great time! The restaurant is located underground in a large space. The vibe is hip, happening, and incredibly loud. 

Unfortunately, they weren't offering the regular menu. Instead, all small items were $5. I had the mini sliders and fries, but was still hungry, so I had the mini pulled pork sandwiches, as well. The fries were nothing special; they were served with ketchup and house mayo. However, the mayo tasted like regular old mayo. The sliders were good, but needed some sauce. The pulled pork sandwiches were quite tasty, albeit a little too salty for my liking. After the pulled pork sandwiches, I was very full and had no room for dessert. 

Service was good. They were all super busy and quite pleasant. The DJ was spinning some seriously awesome old school tunes. Only thing missing was a dance floor."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite to eat and a few beers while watching the Leaf's game. Service was pretty attentive. Never had to wait for another beer. Fish and chips were good if not that plentiful. No complaints and will return."}
{"text":"While in town for business, I was looking for somewhere I could eat solo that was open late - but wouldn't be too loud of a bar scene. This was perfect! I sat at a hightop and order the trout with corn salsa, asparagus, and fingerling potatoes. It was truly delicious, I might even come back for it while I'm in town. One thing I noticed when I left was that the menu on the wall outside didn't totally match what was offered inside. This looked like a fun place to grab a few drinks with friends where you could actually hear one another. The drink selection looked great!"}
{"text":"Wasn't daring enough to get the beef tartare but the food I had there was damn good but slightly weird but I guess that's what made it taste great. Good drinks and a good feeling atmosphere and good to see a place busy as it should on a Saturday. Make sure staff is always cognizant of what's going on"}
{"text":"- Nice hidden patio, very cute
- Kale karnivore salad was delicious, but very small portion
- Solid service"}
{"text":"I went for winterlicious. I had the popcorn chicken which came with a dip. The chicken was amazing but I prefer it without the dip. For the main I had the Mac and cheese. Despite past reviews I've read I thought it was great. For dessert I had the apple turnover which I usually don't like, but it was very good. The decor gave it character and the service was pretty good. The waiter constantly checked up on us but I wasn't sure if he was truly concerned for our well-being. Overall very good"}
{"text":"Looks better than it tastes - appetising menu is let down by poor execution. 


Pros: 
Good selection of beers on tap and in tall cans, and reasonably priced.
Nice decor and ambiance - we were able to follow a Leafs game on TV but the volume was low enough to hold conversations. 
Service was cheerful and accommodating, if a bit slow (albeit it was a busy Saturday night). 

Cons: 
The food. My fries were cold - twice. The \"carnivore\" plate had little protein. The soft-shell crab sandwich was clearly undercooked. Really below par for a bar, let alone a \"gastro-pub\"."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, and have seen it change and re-brand itself several times. It has never disappointed - there is always room to sit, even on a busy night. They always have the right game playing on TV, and the vibe is just right. The food here is terrific, despite the relatively small menu selection. The menu does change frequently, so no shortage of new stuff to try once in a while. Recently, they have dropped their draught beer prices, which is great news for returning customers, if not slightly worrisome.

The only disappointment is their unusual patio, in the alley at the back of the building. Just a little bit depressing."}
{"text":"Just opened so our food items were 30% off. I had fish & chips (thick fries, very tasty). The fish was good. The menu is vast but the print is so tiny and hard to read (8 point font, I think). Wine selection was OK and they apparently now have 14 beers on tap (when I was there, they only had the usual (boring) suspects: Heineken, Coors, Guinness, etc. Prices are higher than at other \"pubs\" but this is more like an upscale pub. Gastro maybe?

The space is large and there are TVs behind the bar (good for games!). It was pretty empty on a Friday night but they had just opened. Our server was attentive and friendly. The bathrooms are ultra-clean and nicely decorated but the stalls were built for miniature people! You know, the ones that don't allow you to sit on the toilet without your legs hitting the door. Someone didn't measure properly. 

Final thoughts: I would return if I was (a) in the neighborhood and (b) there was a game on."}
{"text":"It was about a month when I went here.  Wow, looking back I can't believe the value I received here compared to some of these trendy new cocktail joints my post work adventures have taken me.

I am pretty sure I had been here before for work many jobs ago; I'll assume this place had a different name back then.

This time around, I hit up the Fifth Pub House after work, right before Gallery 44's Photo Bingo event.  I needed to kill some time and they had a $5 pint special.  Sold!  I ended up ordering the California club sandwich as well.  Colour me impressed!  Tasty sandwich with fresh cut fries.  That, the beer, tax and tip was just $25.  Or less than half for a couple of drinks and maybe a nibbly something at one of the aforementioned haute cocktail bars in Toronto.  

Service was excellent.  I sat on the long patio that is off the main street.  

Recommended!  I imagine this place works really well for the Friday-Saturday night drinking crowds.  It is a good happy hour place as well.  But don't limit  yourself to beverages--their slightly upscale pub grub is great."}
{"text":"My friends and I were wanting to try out the gastropub next to the club we frequently go to on Fridays. I noticed that they had daily specials paired with the beer for the day. Booking a table was not difficult for a party of 8.

At first, we were seated in a somewhat private area until the live music started to setup. Instantly, we asked the waitress if we could move as the music overpowered our conversation. They quickly found another table away from the stage for us to be seated.

In terms of the specials, the website at the time had different prices posted compared to the menus that we were given.  I advised the waitress of that fact and she replied that they needed to find someone to update so it was slow for the change. We did not expect to get the price on the web but only one of us order the special at the menu price.

Overall, it was a good experience with live music and great company.  I checked the menu online recently and they have updated the prices higher than the menu price. I guess cost of ingredients are forcing them to raise prices."}
{"text":"Although i have never been a server, I assume that it is common practice to let your patrons know you will not be serving them anymore. Perhaps immediately have someone take over your table. That seems like a rational thing to do. I don't think I would be ki-ki-ing at the bar like a hysterical lunatic, but that's just me."}
{"text":"The Fifth family of companies has various business associated with their brand. I've always passed by this establishment a few times. We came here early and made reservations for 5:30 for a group of 7 of us and came here specifically for buck a shuck oyster night which happens every Tuesday! Our waiter was super surprised when our group decided to order 150 oysters!! They literally only had 200 in stock and it was cool to see everyone hands on deck helping shucking all those oysters and being able to see how it's done. It took about 40 minutes before the oysters were ready to be served! They also brought us different sauces and of course horseradish to flavour up the oysters! The head chef was nice enough to make us fresh shrimp sauce to go with our oysters!  Everyone had about 2 dozens oysters each and you can wrong with $1/oyster. Everyone also ordered other dishes to go along with their oysters. We ordered the Feast Dish which had delicious beef ribs and sausages along with veggies and mashed potatoes. Fairly good dish and a nice dish. Everyone else got either the fried squish dish. Another one our friends ordered the poutine and it was quite a massive portion for just an appetizer. Overall, it's quite a nice restaurant with many tv's where you can watch sports here as well. Staff here are super friendly and nice. Definitely a very enjoyable and pleasant dining experience. Will definitely be back and enjoy some more oysters!! Highly recommend especially on Buck A Shuck Oyster deals on Tuesday nights!!"}
{"text":"I rate this place a 3.5, maybe a 4.  Not sure.  

My friends and I were having a bit of a reunion of sorts.  A large group of approx. 25 people and we needed a place to go for the night with food, drinks and an atmosphere that was accepting of our age (late 30s/early 40s crowd who doesn't want to go clubbing).  The Fifth event staff encouraged us to select the gastropub and they were able to accommodate our group with two big tables right by the bar and a condensed menu to order from.

First, the restaurant itself is really nice.  Reminds me of a Roots ad.  Lots of wood, plaid and Canadiana accents.  It's cozy.  The food isn't amazing (and that's probably the main reason why I can't give it a 4), but it was decent.  I ate a burger sandwiched between two grilled cheese sandwiches and it was pretty tasty.  The caesar salad was the worst I've ever had in my whole life.  I don't know what they were doing with that.

Our waitress was Tiffany.  She is seriously the greatest.  She was on the ball all night long.  Didn't make one mistake, never disappeared, and any time my drink was empty, she was right there offering me another.  Even as we got sloppier as the night wore on, she was super nice and accommodating.   

So, as a restaurant, it's A-OK.  Definitely a nice spot to grab a beer and watch the game.  If you have a large group and need a venue, I highly recommend.  *Very organized* and a good time."}
{"text":"Cool environment, nice music. We went on New Year's Eve before heading to the hall. The nacho starter is huge and delicious, popcorn chicken is good, reasonable amount. Sangria also good. Waitresses ok."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, decently priced drinks and nice waiters. The food is mediocre at best , the fries are extremely thin but seasoned well. Fish and chips is my recommendation."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night with a group of about 11 people. Our server, Megan, was great at handling the size of the party and our various needs as we had a lot of questions and many specific requests for our various meals.

I ordered the grilled jerk calamari which was pretty good, although I did not taste the jerk seasoning. It came with arugula and pickled onions which were actually really tasty (and I don't usually like them.

Other diners in the group ordered a variety of dishes (e.g. Burgers, fish and chips, chicken panini, etc.) and everyone was quite pleased with their choices with the exception of one girl. She ordered the pesto chicken salad, and she didn't really like it. I gathered that the chicken was cold and the fish just wasn't what she was expecting.

The ambiance is pretty casual, although I understand that a dance floor opens up there later in the night, we just didn't stick around to see it. 

I'd go back for a meal, casual drinks, or to partake in the dance floor!"}
{"text":"Solid. Not quite mindblowing, but enjoyable. We had a party of eight and service was pretty good. They made one error on the order, but definitely handled it well, getting the correct order out really quickly. Good selection of drinks, interesting menu items, but a couple of people in our party were disappointed that the menu at the pub didn't match what was online."}
{"text":"Pretty standard bar, with drinks and a menu that's typically what you'd find. A bit on the pricey side. They've got a good number of TVs and a big screen, so it'd be a good spot to watch the game.

Came here with a few friends for their trivia night which is great. The hosts are hilarious and the trivia questions have a range of difficulty levels."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends while we were visiting for a conference. I had the fish and chips, the sweet potato gnocci, and the house-brewed beer (the 5th Stock Ale). The food wasn't too bad, but it also wasn't something to write home about. I did actually like the 5th Stock Ale quite a bit! The atmosphere was very nice and I loved the 80's music they were playing in the background. Our waitress was also absolutely adorable and offered us great service."}
{"text":"So The Fifth Gastropub was not our first choice. Initially we wanted Thai food but as most Friday nights go, everyone was busy with a 1-2 hour wait time. 

A few friends suggested we walk over to The Fifth. When we arrived, it was loud and alive which is a plus. However, we were pretty confused for a solid 3-4 minutes as to whether we seat ourselves or if we wait for someone to seat us. We opted for the latter. We were then seated and our waiter arrived. He was very pleasant -- I wish I remembered his name. I ordered the nachos which were massive and some wings with a side of fries. 

My favourite part of the meal had to be the fries with sea salt. So good! 

I would definitely recommend this place. 4 out of 5 stars, only because of the lack of coordination earlier on at the venue but otherwise an enjoyable experience. 

Apologizes for the lack of photo. Not the best lit place at night :)"}
{"text":"Nothing really spectacular or unique about this pub.  Beer and liquor choices are same as any other pub.  The only thing it has going for is the location of this place in the heart of the Entertainment district of Toronto.  So if you plan on catching a movie or do some bowling, it is just a block away.  If you are feeling reallly ballsy or out of your mind, you can get some drinks here, go next door at the Muay Thai fighting gym and perform the art of drunken fighting/sparring with your buddies.  Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zui_quan (Drunk style martial arts)"}
{"text":"The bar is huge! Plenty of options for beer! TVs all over the place. They had a giant projector screen with Super Smash Brothers. Drinks were reasonably priced and the staff were friendly. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The Fifth Pubhouse = Ah-May-Zing.

I am absolutely in love with the décor and ambiance of this place. While it keeps that more upscale pub feeling, The Fifth also comes with a lot of its own personality and style. Our Salt & Pepper shakers were little, adorable piglets. Really cool artwork (see: army dog in uniform), and other random items scattered through out. The menu is a giant piece of paper that folds out, kind of like a map. Love it.

Our server was super sweet and patient with us, even though we took a really long time to decide what we wanted to eat, and then rushed them to get us out the door so we could make it to the theatre in time after we ate.

The food is, simply put, awesome. I am SUPER picky when it comes to Deep Fried Pickles, and let me tell you, their Tempura Pickles are some of the best battered pickles in the city. They were cooked perfectly which meant the batter was nice and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and full of flavor. 

The Mac & Cheese with Bacon & Tomatoes was fantastic. Perfect amount of cheese, not bland like a lot of Mac & Cheeses can be, and like many of my carnivorous friends agree, bacon just makes everything better.

The Sheppard's Pie is, oddly, made with olives and bacon, but whomever thought it was a good idea to put olives in Sheppard's pie was a genius because it totally works. I seriously wanted to take a giant tub of it home and just live off their Pie for the next month. And, as mentioned previously, bacon just makes everything better =).

& this lovely establishment also honours their Yelp check-in offer - so make sure to check in to get your paws on a free dessert of the chefs choosing! We got free Whoopie Pies which were scrumptious. I'm not big on marshmallows but I was a huge fan of the marshmallow filling (I actually wished there was more!)

To end off our awesome experience here, when we were leaving the hostess gave us all free pastries. I am assuming, because the café is beside the pubhouse, they hand out whatever pastries they don't sell during the day. It's a random pastry (comes in a stapled closed bag,) but this just made me more excited because I love surprises. I ended up with a corn bread muffin that was fantastic. Super moist and obviously fresh from that day, and again, like everything else I've had here, full of flavour & delicious. I stole a bite of a friends Apple Cinnamon muffin that had chunks of real apple inside and it was also quite tasty.

4.5/5 - Almost perfection. The only things missing for me were a.) a nifty cocktail menu & b.) there was no hostess there when I arrived, so I sort of wandered around a little lost until a server found me.

Already planning my next visit here. They have brunch on the horizon, so I will be patiently (maybe not so patiently) awaiting it's arrival!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner and drinks on Saturday night.
It was shockingly juvenile and the pub games were weirdly - weirdly, seriously - sexist."}
{"text":"A few friends and I came here for much needed TGIF drinks a couple weeks ago - the night Justin Bieber randomly showed up to watch a Raptors game and drink. We left before he started playing the piano and I mention this fact because a buddy threw his neck out craning and hyper-extending for a view of the Biebs. It was awkward. 

The pub is totally Canadian themed and we shared a bunch of appetizers - I think fried pickles, onion rings, and popcorn chicken. All deep fried, but not in a dirty greasy way, which went well with our beers. I had the pork belly mac n cheese. It was crazy rich, which you'd expect, but i wish the fat had been rendered. Not a good mouth feel of pork fat with cheese sauce. That was the main drawback.

The best thing about the night was the service - super friendly and attentive. All the staff we interacted with were really nice, even amidst some of their patrons' barely contained Beiber-lust. I would def come back to hang out."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the jay's with my buddies. Food was fantastic and the service was excellent. Our server, pretty sure it was Monica, was extremely attentive. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Jumped in to have some dinner with friends and was immediately seated. Great burger! Service is good, but could be a little bit quicker. Liked the basket of peanuts on the table!"}
{"text":"Went here for a few drinks and nachos before heading over to Yuk Yuks. I liked the rustic-like, cottagy interior and it was pretty spacious. The nachos were really not my favourite and they didn't come with salsa or sour cream which was different. Found it to be quite pricey. Staff was friendly. I'd come here again if I was in the area but not sure I'd make it a regular place."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Absolutely the worst. Bar owner verbally assaulted my girlfriend after pouring a pint of beer into a mismatched beer pitcher. Wouldn't serve us the rest of the night and stood gossiping with the rest of the staff for the remainder of the evening."}
{"text":"A flight of beers for $10, excellent food, fast friendly service and a nice pub style atmosphere. Went here with 4 kids and 4 adults and we all enjoyed the food immensely. My only recommendation would be to offer a flight of pop for kids if that is possible.  This is a place I must return to."}
{"text":"Disgusting veggie burger. It has marinated portobello mushrooms and roasted red peppers and goat cheese. The whole thing tasted like it had been soaked in white vinegar. It was extremely acidic, to the point that I had to eat a bunch of plain fries in between each bite to stop my mouth from stinging. All the insides were so mushy and the bun was hard, which made an unsightly mess. Absolutely nasty. I regret not sending it back."}
{"text":"I am only rating the pub, not the food.

The Fifth Pubhouse is a nice, casual, quiet pub in contrast to other places in the area. If you're like me, and you just love to hear yourself speak, it's a nice change from the other bars in this part of town which are over-the-top loud.

The pub also has some nice perks, like a video game area with big screen TVs and comfy couches, some decent music, and peanuts in the shell.

Best of all, The Fifth Pubhouse offers some drink specials. I payed $4 for a shot of Jack Daniels on a Friday night! I appreciate a place that offers a good value and is not looking to gouge you at every opportunity."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends on Tuesday night to take part of their $1 oyster special.  Right off the bat, we ordered 150 osyters.  The waiter was a little taken back but he was glad that he wouldn't have to worry about not selling out since they ordered 200 oysters for that day.  We also ordered drinks and other dishes as well but we were mainly excited to feast on the oysters.  We ordered so many that they had to get everyone from the kitchen to help shuck the osyters.  We had to wait quite a bit but that was expected.

When the oysters came, it was a sight to dwell on.  It covered our entire table!  There were 3 sauces to choose from; a habenero, a garlic vinegrette, and a shallot vinegrette and of course lots of horseradish.  My wife wanted the cocktail sauce but they didn't have any BUT the waiter spoke to the chef and guess what??? He decided to make the cocktail sauce from scratch for us.  We were greatly appreciated and it tasted fantastic!

After polishing all of the 150 osyters, we started on the other dishes.  We ordered 2 dishes of grilled calamari, 1 poutine and a farmers's plate which comprised of wild boar sausage, mashed potatoes and slow cooked ribs.

Overall, we had a great time.  The waiter was fantastic and delieved great service to our table.  The food was also superb and not to mention the oysters were super fresh! Highly recommend this pubhouse and we will definitely return for another feast in the future."}
{"text":"Before I start this off, I just want to put up a little bias alert: I just threw an event with the lovely people at The Fifth Inc, specifically the Pub House, so obviously I am partial to the people there. I worked closely with them for months and they are all lovely.

This being said, I've been in the space as a paying customer a few times independently of the event planning, so I'm going to give them the lovin' review they deserve. 

Their mac and cheese is off the hook. Toss a little hot sauce in there, and it's probably one of my favourite comfort food dishes in the city. Simple. Gooey. Near perfect. They have over a dozen beers on tap at reasonable prices (especially for the Entertainment District), $5 martinis on Tuesdays and ever-changing drink specials. 

I don't spend much time in this part of Toronto anymore, but all my office-bound friends will be hearing me recommend this place for a pick-me-up lunch (the fatty kind) or an after work drink for years to come."}
{"text":"Onion rings.... Onions were raw, batter tasted like nothing. Mac and cheese was a watery cheese sauce, I've made better at home. Husband ordered burger, it is made in house but it's the only burger ever that has a bitter after taste. 

However, lots of great beers and great for groups. Frites were also great. Server was also really nice, felt bad that the food was so bad.

Bottom line, would come back for beer but nothing else."}
