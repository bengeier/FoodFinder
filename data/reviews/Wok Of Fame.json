{"text":"I decided to attend the Wok Of Fame , with some high hopes of enjoying a quality buffet in Brampton. Having called ahead and reserving a few seats for 7:30, turned out to be a great way of ensuring that we were guaranteed some seats for the dinner rush hour. We showed up ahead of schedule and we were pleasantly surprised that they sat us down at a table, 1/2 hour before our reservation. When i placed the reservation, the lady on the phone politely mentioned that, we had a maximum seating time of 2 hours. So if you are someone who likes to sit down with a couple of drinks and talk with family and friends while you eat, think about it before you visit. 2 hours may seem like a lot of time but once you get your first plate down, you will soon feel like you are being rushed to eat. 

   The way i review all my restaurants, is according to a score sheet that i created. I look at the time that i ordered food and what time i received it but this being a buffet situation, time is in our hands only. I score the rest as following:

Flavor: 4/10
presentation:5/10
service: 5/10
Ambiance: 9/10
Quality of glasses and plates: 5/10
menu design: 5/10
cleanliness of cutlery: 6/10
cleanliness of place: 7/10
Music: 10/10
Worth the price: 3/10
                                                                               ***Overall performance: 59/100


CONS:
I decided to go to the side of the buffet, where the ribs and duck were, hoping to have some fresh products but only the label on top of the actual dish suggested that. The actual duck and other meats itself ,are another story. Duck is known to have a high fat content in the first place but this duck was just a piece of lard sitting on my plate.

* Moving down the line, i decided to try the roast beef, that was prepared to be carved by the cook working at that station, on a wooden board. I decided to leave after 5 minutes of staring at an empty plate, because i assumed the cook was on break or forgot that they were in charge of carving the chunk of lonely meat sitting there in the open.

*Most of the vegetables had many Asian influenced flavors, which were really great but i personally thought the vegetables were very under cooked because my button mushrooms were crunchy and it tasted very gritty, which is obviously not a good sign.

*If you are a fan for desserts and have ever been to a buffet , you know that this is the time of night,  where you get to pull up your sleeves and get down and dirty, right? Welllll, i would strongly recommend that you keep your sleeves buttoned up  for this place. Don't get me wrong when i say this but this is by far the worst dessert experience in a \"Buffet\" for me and here is one reason why.... 
         * I accidentally dropped a mini cake on my way back to the table because i had so many items in my hands. My first expected reaction was to be: dam, there's going to be cake scattered on the ground now and i have to clean it up. Looking down below the plates, i realized that the cake didn't even have a dent, in fact i think that the place which the cake had initially dropped was actually cleaner than before. Usually buffets cover up dry items with a moist cream but this was just a bad experience all together.

PROS:
Items on my menu for the night: 
* The live / open kitchen environment was a great idea and it was the best tasting out of everything they had to offer. Why? Because you get to decide from an array of items at the raw bar, which is held by a very creative canoe shaped structure, which initially allows you to pick from beef, chicken, shrimp and a list of vegetables and of course noodles. I decided to have the chicken, beef,shrimp stir fry with egg noodles and pad Thai sauce. Overall taste of food was exceptional, due to the fresh, hot plate of goodness you get, in about under 5 minutes.

*Flat -top grilled Whole shrimp and mussels were another highlight to the night, as they were prepared from fresh shrimps and mussels straight off the ice and surprisingly, we received a good portion for each and every one of us. The grill cooks were very polite and had fun with the food they were making, which is what i like to see as a chef myself and it only allowed the experience their to grow better. They were both cooked well and had a garlic butter sauce on top of each one, which rendered into the products themselves and enhanced the flavor of the oil beneath them.

* The sushi bar has a variety of items on it but being a buffet, the sushi tends to sit out a while, so it got kind of dry over a period. I personally am a huge sushi fan and love Japanese cuisine, so critiquing this part of the restaurant, i would say that it could have been better.

* The best part about the Wok of Fame, is the design of the place itself and the art inside of it. Beautiful Fish tanks, a koi pond and relaxing music, that is performed live, by a pianist, one of the best designed buffets we got. 

BON APPETIT!!!! ( kingsimbareviews: youtube channel)"}
{"text":"This place had fresh food and it's awesome!! Went here for dinner and it has so many choices . Love the Peking duck!! Awesome for family's celebration .."}
{"text":"Not a good buffet.  Quality and selection is not the best. Drinks are serve-yourself..with bottled water in a fridge and your typical selection of juice and pop from the sida machines. Sushi was not the freshest and fell apart when you picked them up. The stir fry selection wasn't too bad with your typical veg,seafood, and meats. 

Dessert selection was horrible! Precut cakes were placed in a fridge...makes you wonder how long they have been in there!  Only one fruit was available... cantalope. 

Would definitely not be coming back!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better buffet places I've been to. The 'wok bar' was pretty good. Try the garlic sauce!
I was a bit disappointed by the lack of sushi variety. However, it was of very high quality, especially the salmon sushi. 

Don't let the vast dessert variety fool you. I found only the waffles, soft ice cream and the mocha mousse to be worth while. 

Best of all, drinks are included! That's amazing!! Fountain and bottled!

Also, you eat for free on your birthday! Nothing beats free!!"}
{"text":"Although the interior and decorations were very nice in a spacious environment, giving a comforting family feel, the food was just ok and the service was horrible. There was a good variety of food but disappointed in the quality of foods. The server/waiter barely made rounds at our table to collect our dishes. There was barely any acknowledgement and the bill took more than 20 min to arrive when asked. There was an automatic tip charge after taxes on the bill. This wouldn't be a problem if the server did their job well but they did not."}
{"text":"No, this used to be better, but I was there for my birthday on March 20th, well into the dinner service at 7pm, and all the food tasted stale. The General Tao Chicken was so hard i couldn't cut through it, and it felt like gum. I had 1 plate of what felt like stale, old food and I decided not to eat anything else. After such I stopped eating after half a plate. Later on my parents went home, and all through the night they got sick. I've never had a worse birthday, Thanks Wok of Fame. Would not recommend ANYMORE, it used to be a lot better but over time it's gone down the gutter. Even the fresh food that they made, made my father sick."}
{"text":"Highly recommended by friend, then my husband and I decided to try it yesternight. After arrived at the parking lot we found there was almost full, but it's located in a big plaza, so it's not a problem on parking. After parked our car,we walked straight to the restaurant. First came into my mind was it's big and with a classic renovation, there's a live piano show in the middle that makes it so luxury ,especially the player is a beautiful girl.

OK...it's time to start to talk about their food. Like usual, we start with lighter food,salad and soup. I got a salmon tofu miso soup with two spoons dried seaweed on top,that's a little bit surprise for me to try  it, I think that's a very healthy soup. But the salad is nothing special.

After appetizer,we went for seafood. They have crab legs ,cocktail shrimp, cold mussels...  the qualitys just average.  And the hot tables also standing on a average level, just like usual Chinese buffet.
 
Their selling point is the live cooking, for sure, I had to try it. On one side, they have chicken steak, beef steak, and beef short ribs on meats options,and also have seafood stir-frying on pan,some fish, shrimp and mussels. The other side , they service few bowls of meats,vegetables, mushrooms and different kinds of noodles for choose. People can pick whatever they like to mix stir-frying together, and also have different kinds of sauces for choosing. To be honestly,that's a very good idea on running a Chinese and Japanese buffet in nowaday. And people likes to decide their special dish by themselves, especially meats lovers and vegetarians.
 
So far,what I want to share is almost done. The left food like sushi bar, desserts,fruits and drinks are nothing special. I just tried a little bit on each.

Finally, I would like to tell probably I will go again with friends on some special events, like birthday party?they have birthday freebie event?,otherwise we won't go just by ourselves."}
{"text":"Foods are not much good. Prices are way too high than the quality of food. I got food from the live kitchen and was too disappointed! Steaks weren't cooked well. One common sauce for every thing with too much garlic. And prices are too too too much high in terms of service. Bad pick!!"}
{"text":"I love the option of having food cooked to order in a buffet setting.   Amazing selection, fantastic atmosphere.  The only downside is that the popularity can mean long wait times. But the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Overall Impression:
Nice interior and service, but we were sick afterward, and felt we definitely paid too much for the quality we got.  Overall, I'll never go back. 

Details below

Interior:
-very spacious 
- good amount of space between hot and cold tables, meaning few bottleneck areas
-open unprotected table with raw meat, meant to be used for fresh cooked stir fry. Presents great possibility for health hazards

Service:
-very friendly and kind
-drinks are self serve however

Value:
-it cost us about $30 a person before gratuity
-they charge an extra $10 if they think you've been wasteful with food. Not unheard of, but makes you nervous when spitting something gross into a napkin, which we did a lot
-soft drinks and water are included

Food - the good:
-sushi better than any other buffet sushi we've had
-Asian beef stew was tender and flavourful
-chicken balls were among my top 5
-broccoli beef, also very flavourful and savoury
-Good variety of ice cream
-mini pancakes were a hit

Food - the not so good:
-pork ribs were very salty and rather chewy
-jello wasn't good, rubbery and bland

Food - the inedible:
-the pork was all grease and tasted like cooking oil despite the sauce
-the crispy duck was chewy with skin like a rubber band
-the breaded items(chicken, scallops, onion rings) were all very chewy as well
-the fried noodles were extremely greasy and tasted only of cooking oil

We left feeling sick and it only got worse into the night. We were so concerned about the food wasting fee that we probably ate more than we should have of the inedible chewy and greasy food. 

I got the impression that the food had been sitting out since lunch for how stale it tasted.

I wanted to try the fresh cooked stir fry, but couldn't bring myself to do it after eating the other food there. Since I was pretty sure much of what I'd eaten had been sitting out much of the day, I didn't trust the salad-bar-like table of raw meat with no sneeze guard or barriers. I also didn't like the idea of piling the raw items on a plate and carrying it across the aisle to the cooks(whom the meat should have been kept with to prevent mishaps or accidents or tampering).  That portion of the restaurant is badly designed, and for all its novelty, presents too much potential for something to go wrong.

In the end, my wife and I paid $60 before gratuity to be sick for the night.  I don't recommend this  restaurant."}
{"text":"We had phone and make  reservation when we came in they said we don't have your name we really disappoint the way they handle it seem like they don't care"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for my moms 60th birthday. We invited friends and family. I was given the wrong information (price and the time allowed to stay). The painful part is that the manager will not accept their mistake. He wanted to kick us out unless we pay the full price. So even though we have the agreement signed by the supervisor, it didn't matter. Be careful when you deal with this people. Lack of communication between managers and supervisors and also Lack of training...  The place is not being run professionally.
So BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Great selection of grilled steaks, short ribs, seafood, crab legs, exotic fruits and sushi. A great place for a special occasion night out that will satisfy all tastes!"}
{"text":"Simply wonderful.
This is by far one of my favourite Chinese buffets in Ontario. Why? Because the restaurant itself is very big, the setting is very nice and unique/classy. Also they offer free drinks where you can go fill up yourself. For the food itself, the taste is amazing compared to other competitors such as Mandarin, Wasabi... Etc."}
{"text":"Once every while someone comes up with an idea that just sticks. Everyone's heard of a great place but nobody's been there. Well this is the place.
Decided to visit for lunch on a Tuesday in August. Parking lot is big and was crowded so didn't know what to expect. Inside the doors the place was warm and welcoming. Big fish tanks and ponds. Seated immediately by the window. Although the restaurant opens at 11:30 and we arrived at 11:30, the buffet was ready to go. Huge selection of the regular fare expected in a Chinese buffet. The Sushi and Sashimi was even more impressive. Hand rolled and prepared right in front of your eyes. Everything was fresh and inviting. The best part though was the live cooking. Gather your own fresh ingredients (beef, shrimp, chicken, fish, seafood balls, veggies, peppers, noodles...) and deliver them to the Wok Chef. He cooks them to perfection and adds the sauce of your choice. Tried the Thai Chili sauce on mine and it was perfect for lunch. Around the other side of the island awaits the Teppanyaki Chef who prepares your sirloin, chicken breast or fish filet and tops off with a delicious garlic butter sauce. Not as impressive as the Iron Chef with his tools but he does give them a spin and makes a mean steak. Desert if you saved room extends from soft serve ice cream to caramel Creme and pastries. Didn't even get to try the many soups. Much better on all counts in my eyes than the Mandarin. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese buffet in the GTA. Ridiculously expensive ($28+tax for weekend dinner), though that doesn't stop the place from filling up on weekends and holidays. The interior is absolutely massive. There is less variety of food than you'd expect given the size of the place, and some of the food stations are duplicated - this reduces lineups but they could easily have more variety.

The highlight of the place is the \"live cooking\" stations, which consists of several cooks behind grills making fresh beef/chicken/shrimp/fish/etc. as customers line up and wait for it. During busy times it's never by request; you wait and get what you get. I've never been when the place is dead; I don't know if they stop grilling altogther or do it by request only. They also make custom dishes in the Wok for you, so you fill your plate with raw vegetables and meats, pick a sauce and watch them make it for you. So basically the Chinese equivalent of an omelette station. The problem with omelette (or Wok) stations is that you end up with the right ingredients but the flavors are usually basic and bland - the meat you want with a sauce. I would rather they spend the effort making delicious pre-designed dishes that are more complex. But that's just nit-picking. The food is fresh and tasty, the sushi is good and the drinks are included. Best Chinese buffet in Toronto.

It is nice that the buffet includes drinks. Though common in the USA, Canadian buffets still charge separately for drinks, so this is a nice touch."}
{"text":"For a Chinese buffet it was ok. Its not authentic, so it's like the Mandarin. I miss my authentic Chinese food. Mashed potatoes and pizza at a Chinese restaurant...c'mon, really?! I guess it's to please the kiddies. When you walk in its very welcoming. You walk over a bridge with a pond underneath with koi fish and turtles. Chinese decorations throughout, which is a nice touch. Place is huge because it used to be a home outfitters etc. Lots of seating so it's good for big groups. There are different stations set up, one of which is the drink station. Yes that's right, you have to get your own drink. Nobody at my table liked this. It would be a pain if your sitting in the back of restaurant and if you have children with you, you have to balance drinks and full plates or make a trip up another time just for drinks. So much easier if they just brought it to your table. We had arrived at 230pm on a sat not knowing they close at 3 to get ready to reopen at 5. So we had to stock up our plates with whatever was left. What we were unhappy with was that a whole complete station was already cleared away when we went up to buffet well before 3pm and they were starting to clear some more of the trays before they were even empty! At least wait til 3, the time that you tell people! The waitresses were friendly though and always smiling."}
{"text":"We were extremely excited to try this place- we were excited upon entering and seeing how awesomely decorated the restaurant is!
They definitely spent all of their time, effort & money creating the atmosphere and the way this place looks, rather than focusing on the food or service! 

The food was terrible. Go to Mandarin. Seriously.
The concept & idea of the place is great, but the food is absolutely lacking.

We  found a piece of plastic in our 1.5yr old babies food! UNACCEPTABLE. The baby could have easily choked on this! 
The SERVICE. Wow. What a disgrace. 
We quickly flagged down a server and asked for the manager. 
A 'supervisor' came out saying the manager wasnt in. This supervisor was an absolute joke. He could not speak any english (we are an asian family, this is not about race)  and was not apologetic in the least. He seemed offended that we were upset about this, and said he was going to find out where the plastic came from. 
WE DONT CARE where it came from. These things happen, yes. But how you handle it is what sets you apart from the rest. This supervisor gave us attitude, did not say sorry and only offered 10% off our bill. Which would have been fine had his attitude not been so horrible. He was antagonizing and confrontational. 
We asked for the managers card so we could call him when he was in - the supervisor goes and magically brings out the manager who i guess WAS in. 

The manager thankfully was incredibly apologetic- as a manager should be when these things happen! He understood our concern was with the baby- and comped one of our meals, and promised to speak with the supervisor. 

SUCH a horrible experience, ruined our night and left us with an extremely bad taste in our mouth considering we were so excited to go and try this place. 

We will NOT be returning and urge Yelp readers not to go either."}
{"text":"I think this place might be the new Mandarin... but better! 

I really enjoyed all the variety they had as well as their cooking station. Their presentation is very organized and unique and food was above average buffet!

I'm a fan :) Try it out! Also you can eat free on your birthday"}
{"text":"Went here twice, first time I found it hard to get around to pickup for food if you have an injury to your leg or pull back in my case. A little pricier than I thought, however the drinks (except alcohol) are included. Very typical as compare to Mandarin chain, with the kids play area as exception.

The first time was a friend's daughter birthday. Plenty of room for large parties and other clients. My wife did not find their sashimi fresh enough and my little 2 yrs old picked up on it too. It could also be the kids playroom that distracted them from eating, because of this room, we as  parent had to spend some times watching the kids. Other kids were very rude and physical, to the point of injuring themselves and other. Very filthy in this room as kids brought in food there as well.

The freshly pick your own fish, chicken or beef line was quite busy and very tasty. The dim sum section was OK not dim sum restaurant quality. Dessert was pretty good and fair size in selection as well. The kids definitely love this dept.

Our second visit was for my birthday, meal service was starting off great. Till I went to get the chicken skewers for my 2 yrs old. Luckily the kids wanted to play and it was my turn to watch them. My wife started to ingest the chicken then bit into a string of sheet metal. When we brought it to the waiting staffs' attention, the waiting staff was not very apologetic. The manager vow to investigate right away and came back with the reasoning that cooking staffs wore these steel gloves to protect themselves when putting the chicken on the skewers and this could be how that sheet metal string must have got caught in the food. Luckily, it is not my daughter that swallow it, nor did my wife cut her gums when she chewed the chicken. What was disappointing was they offered us two little glow in the dark dolphins for my kids and priced my wife's meal as children fare which is about 40% off. This incident really ruined my brother appetite and ended his meal then at only 2 plates of food ( he avg 4-6 plates). We have not been back there since July. I am not sure if we will. We told this incident to all our friends which is about 50 or so, everyone said we should have demanded free meal for her or me as it is a birthday celebration being ruined. My dad's decorum prevented me from taking matter into my own hand, since it was him that was paying for the bill.  
I just hope Hockey Sushi survive them since it is just across the parking lot with about 10 time the space."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to go to! Especially after a full day of work with no food at all! It has a wonderful variety of foods, and a very entertaining live cooking station! It;s nice to see a change from Mandarin! It's truly wonderful here! The price is a big jump from Mandarin but it is totally worth it! The decor is also on a whole different level! It's beautiful in here! Also, drinks are free unlike Mandarin.  Love this place! Will totally come back! :D"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, you're like, \"WHOA!  This place is HUGE!  It's like a Vegas buffet!\"

Food is okay-some repeated items in the hot food area, but if you count the noodle station, and the grill station, then there's quite a bit of hot food.  

But for me, the hum dinger is the sushi station!  The sashimi is always being refilled which I like because then I know it's fresh.  And of course, the usual rolls are there too.  For the little ones, they'll love the soft serve ice cream station, hot waffle bar, chocolate fountains, and the refrigerators of cakes and puddings!  

Lots of fun, lots of food-not A+ quality food, but still the quantity and variety makes up for the quality."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by friends when I asked if they've tried Spoonfuls.
We were both VERY disappointed with the food quality and really only have positives for the self serve bottled water and Pepsi products.
The men's washroom floor was disgusting to stand in wearing sandals and the whole environment was confused with low quality buffet tables.
Spend a few dollars more per person and go to Spoonful!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for my brother's birthday (which is nice because he ate free!). I thought it was OK. I wouldn't say the food is great but there is a lot of variety and I do appreciate the live cooking station. I wish they had tempura and more selection in maki rolls; they only have the fake crab/vegetable/shrimp rolls, nothing with fresh fish. 

The dessert selection is huge - you're bound to find something you like there. I especially liked the mini waffles and the blueberry cheesecake. 

There is pretty much no service - other than to clear your plates. You get your own drinks etc. I don't appreciate how prices are raised for the holidays ($27.99 per adult on a weeknight, hard to justify for mediocre quality food) because it's not like their costs are changing! That being said, this place was still packed on a Wednesday.

I guess it's ok if you're feeling gluttonous and want lots of options but not really the place to get anything authentic. Ambiance is nice; I especially like the pond at the entrance and the set-up is well planned."}
{"text":"I really like the grilling station, they grill nice steak, fish, and chicken.  Another bonus is that they provide free drinks like fountain pop and juice and water bottles.  The sushi station is not too bad, however they lack variety of fruits and desserts.  The worse part I think is their noodle station.  I've tried their pad thai and it was nothing like it.  Their noodle soup is nothing special either.  If you can't make good stir fried noodles or soup then don't try to impress by having it because I think most people would agree that this station sucks!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, not a whole lot of options for an all you can eat and such a large location. I thought the servers were decent, not particularly outstanding or interested in what you are doing. Great for groups, went there as part of a birthday party."}
{"text":"I think it's a decent buffet . Fresh ,and there variety of different food .
It's good for a big number family 
It's ok once awhile"}
{"text":"Meh. 
I was told that this place was amazing so I thought I'd try it out. We went for Friday dinner with the premium price of about $30 ea. 
It is like how others mentioned that this is like an upscale buffet. The layout of the actual buffet was pretty good. The live cooking or the fresh cooking was the highlight of the buffet. It's a nice touch but the meal itself was just bland. I tried the steak, asked for medium well got it well done as the cut of the steak was thin. Same goes for the ribs. Basically the steak and the ribs tasted the same which is a little salty with lots of garlic butter on top.
We also tried the noodle station. That was okay, lots of ingredients to choose from. 
The dessert was good. Lots of pastry and ice cream! The best was the mini pancakes! I think those pancakes really saved this to 3 stars. It was just delicious!

The atmosphere was great and live music was a nice touch. Kind of pricey for what it is but it's a good experience. Go and try it."}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful interior and is huge inside. The lobby has a big fish tank full of huge parrot fish.  I have three of these in my fish tank and didn't know they could get that big.  Yikes. 

The food is standard Chinese buffet good but has a lot of variety and is decent. There is the mongolian grill section, salad bar, sushi/sashimi, dessert, soups, hot and cold foods with the usual Chinese entrees and beverage section where you get your own drinks and a refrigerator with bottled water.   In the hot food section they did have a lamb dish which I don't see at any of the Asian buffets in my hometown, Seattle.  I thought the food was okay.  You don't expect to be blown away with buffet food.  But it is good place for a family gathering."}
{"text":"Excellent alternative to Mandarin prices a little lower quality of food was excellent paired with good service. Only let down for me was the dessert section really bot much variety. Mandarin wins hands down in that area, However a plus considering Wok of Fame includes softdrinks and water in the price of buffet.
Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Tons of selections to choose from- more than any other buffet that I have been to in the GTA. What distinguishes this buffet from most is that they have a live cooking station- you pick your ingredients and a chef cooks the dish for you. 

Largest dessert selection at a buffet that I have seen outside of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was good. Of course lots of variety. The sashimi was great though the sushi left something to be desired. If you love desserts as well this is a great location. Free, unlimited, self serve bottled water, fountain pops and fountain fruit drinks. Price is quite high for dinner. If you want to try would recommend going for lunch when the prices are significantly lower."}
{"text":"Good prices 
Clean open restaurant. With a comfortable setting
On the weekends they have someone playing the piano.  
The food is awesome.  From the sushi to the salad bar, from the preprepared dishes to the live cooking 
The flavours are awesome
The servers are prompt and pleasant
No pressure to get out
Sit back and enjoy your meal"}
{"text":"Its a buffet so you can't expect culinary extraordinaire but as a buffet place it definitely stands out. 

At Wok of Fame, food consists of sushi, wok dishes, teppanyaki, hot dishes, soups, pastries, salads and desserts. Soft drinks and juices at their drinks stations are also included into the price
.
But...But....But!!!

Live cooking is what separates Wok of Fame from the rest. we can choose the ingredients that we want, and it can be cooked the way we want by their chefs at the live-cooking Wok and Teppanyaki stations.

The place is nicely decorated and quiet huge, so space wont be a problem. I took around 20 people and the server was able to manage us and keep our table clean at all times. 

Overall, as a buffet place it does a good job!"}
{"text":"It's always a great place to go to when celebrating something with friends or family! It's a big place that can accommodate large groups and has a wide variety of food that will please everyone! If you end up bringing someone here that doesn't like it thennnnn I don't know what to tell you! 

If it's you or someone's birthday, even better, birthday celebrant is FREE! So if you have that person who's picky and they just happen to be the celebrant then tell em' to suck it up...free food always tastes better! 

One thing I don't like (and always make the same mistake by getting it in hopes that it will change or get better) is their grill....their steak sucks....every time. All the other items are always cooked really well and tastes good but the steak....stay away! I always hope that every time I come back it would improve but so far it hasn't. They cook all their grilled items with tons of garlic which is amazing. The look and smell of the steak is mouth watering but always ends up overcooked and chewy no matter how you want it cooked. I've even tried asking different people to make it and nope, still the same! They will always ask you how you like it cooked....I bet even if you said rare, it would still come out overcooked!

With that being said, still a great place to go to just stay away from the steak"}
{"text":"My main problem with this restaurant is that for everything they offer, there are local options that are better. The live cooking (AKA Teppanyaki) section looks impressive, but for tasty Teppanyaki, the best local options include Yang's, Iron Chef and Tako which are all in Mississauga. In my opinion, the Chinese food at the Mandarin tastes better and is fresher than the Chinese fare at Wok Of Fame. There are numerous sushi joints in Brampton and Mississauga that have better sushi. Deserts are much better at Spoonful. Some customers like the décor at Wok Of Fame; however, I prefer The design of both Spoonful and The Mandarin. .In summary, while Wok Of Fame has a lot of variety in its food offerings, none of it impresses me.

Obviously there are customers that like the mediocrity of this place; however, I can't recommend it."}
{"text":"Do you remember that classic 90s cooking show where the guy cooked exclusively with Woks? I think it was called Wok With Yen. If so you recall the plethora of amazing Asian inspired dishes he would concoct and moreover you'd remember his endless aprons and punny Wok comments such as \"Wok, don't run\". Laaaawwwwlllll. 

Ok, why mention this? I dunno, maybe I'm about to Wok out some serious puns so strap yourself in it's gonna be a woky ride! 

We were headed back from a holiday party that we excused ourselves early on account of a lack of food and were desperate to find mid week eats that could wokommodate a variety of tastes - and be OPEN after 9pm (I realize these are not the best laid plans). 

A quick yelp app search revealed that Wok of Flame was not only close by but open for another 90 minutes, score!!!

We pulled into the lot and got ready to Wok out! As others have mentioned we were advised that last call was about 45 minutes away (no worries) and that holiday pricing was in effect. I found this to be a little shitty since we were there so close to closing and essentially were accepting leftovers for dinner. Give your customers a break around these times when people are spending extra money while they Wok around the Christmas tree (or menorah). 

It's massive. That's all you need to know, easily there is seating for what appears to be 700+. There had to be close to 200 people there when we arrived and 3/4 of the space was unseated. Not to be outdone, the buffet areas are massive as well. The buffet includes, dessert/fruit area, sushi area, raw food (think Mongolian grill style), grill area, white-person Chinese food (chicken balls and sweet and sour pork etc), a roast meat section (beef, duck, pork... impressive) and a salad section (there may have been more but notably there were so many sections it's hard to keep track.

One plus over a spot like the Mandarin is that all non-wokoholic beverages are also unlimited, included and self-serve. 

Maybe it was the time of night (most likely) but all the food was sort of ... bleghh. Not gross, cooked fine or overcooked, had been sitting for quite some time, not great... basically palatable. The roasted duck was about 60% blubbery fat, the sashimi did not look safe to eat, as well as the Mongolian wok section raw meats. The safest things to eat it seemed were the white-person Chinese fare the deep fried selection, salad bar, and dessert - definitely not worth the money paid.

I'd be willing to give this place another try during peak turnover time but definitely never again during holidays pricing or late at night again.

Eatcrest out."}
{"text":"I've been to wok of fame before a few times and have always loved it but this time not so much. 

Everything was fine I went with a few friends for a friends birthday. So the person that has a birthday eats free. Well it's always nice to get something free on your birthday. 

Anyways. We where eating we had not been there a half hour and they tell us they where closing at 3. Well nobody told us that. If that was the case we would have came back at 5. 

Then one waitress came over to me and told me when people eat there that there's a 2 hour limit. It's a all you can eat place. I'm not saying that people are going to keep running up getting plate after plate but people go there to relax and have a good time. 

The way they where today has put a bad taste in my mouth about wok of fame. I will be honest I'm not sure I will be going back. 

It's to bad because I really liked the place."}
{"text":"The food in this place is ridiculously delicious! Everything is fresh and succulent. Thank you wok of fame for bringing your food to Ontario. I hope that other buffet restaurants will step up to the plate like wok of fame. Their grilled items, sashimi, miso soup, sundae and many more are the ones to die for."}
{"text":"As for the comments regarding service I'm going to treat those as outliers because my experience was superb. The only items that aren't available in the buffet are alcohol and specialty drinks.  You need to ask your server for those. That's pretty much it. Also this is a 1000 seat, high volume eating emporium. If you're looking for your server to provide constant attention at a place like this then you will be disappointed. Also what is wrong with you?

There are dozens of options that you will not find at most buffets, specifically the live cooking stations. There's a carvery and your standard Chinese buffet fare. But the fact that there are options that offer a somewhat healthy alternative is refreshing. 

Bottom line the food tastes good. The service is good. Soft drinks and bottled water are included. Have fun and leave satisfied without spending a lot."}
{"text":"Wok of Fame is like an amusement park, but with food. They've got chefs with woks in the middle of the restaurant who will cook up whatever raw ingredients you bring them, they have a chocolate fountain over in the dessert side for you to cover whatever you want in chocolate, there's even someone playing a piano in there sometimes.

I've gone there for lunches and dinners and a free birthday or two. Their food has been great 90% of them time, only once was everything lacking in flavour.

Service is like any other buffet, they take your plates away when you're done with them. Exactly the same as Mandarin and Tandoori Flame."}
{"text":"I haven't had the chance to properly review this restaurant after dining here a few times  due to a particular, arrogant host that keeps floating between AYCE sushi restaurants around the west GTA. Now that he is no longer here, I find I can enjoy this restaurant much more.

The last time I was here was for lunch on a statutory holiday. Price is much more than any other buffet restaurant: Adult ($22.99 pp) and seniors ($18.40). I'd have to say it is worth paying this price if you know exactly what you want to eat. All food stations are actively open and the sushi bar converts to sashimi. Perhaps this is why the price is much more because there the sashimi is gone as soon as the staff refreshes the bowl.

The entrance is grand. Reservations are kept. The entire dining area expands around the windows and into the back area. Décor fills the space above quite well (including the very large tree in the middle of the restaurant. Service is typical - Sometimes you have to find the staff for service because they are busy filling drink orders and cleaning up after tables.

Food covers everything that you could possibly look for in a Japanese/Chinese buffet restaurant. They have several drink stations to wet your whistle, including unlimited bottled spring water. Cold salads, fried foods, stir fry station, grill station, sushi and maki station, fried foods, and most importantly a couple of dessert stations including a large chocolate fondue. I can watch that machine ooze chocolate all day.

But whatever you do, stay away from the grilled meat station. Unless you're hungry like the wolf, you'll be giving your jaws a workout and chewing for days into unseasoned meat.

{"text":"Loved this place! The garlic shrimp were my favorite! This is when I had a large enough stomach to consume all their offerings!!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Long lines everywhere ! Started with wanton soup n find the wanton overcooked.next tried the wok.put almost all ingredients and chose tempura sauce which I like. Next teppanyaki,had to wait half an hour for one steak, hot items another 15 to 20 minutes from the line then desserts,maybe another 15 to 20 minutes that I have to eat the dessert while on the line.when we finished its already 3 pm which is their closing time for lunch."}
{"text":"Over all it's a big and wonderful place. Lot of food variety and big area to cover all items. Couldn't give 4 star as it didn't meet expectations as the 1st impression I got at entrance. Food was not of that quality as per my expectations."}
{"text":"I have to say... This is my favorite buffet in Brampton. If you're in the area, drop by. It's a bit on the pricy side compared to regular buffets, but the food quality is great! I love the work and the fact that it's always made fresh because you pick your raw ingredients and the quantity, then hand it over to the chef and he cooks it in the sauce you want it in! Love this place a lot!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars i would lmao because when they opened they had green sea snails (grand opening promotion nowthey dont serve it anymore) which were great but now theyre just gross. The seafood like the crab and mussels are over salted, the fish was meh, the raw seafood was meh, the pad Thai sauce was so sweet??? The chinese food was so white washed since it opened. Dessert selection was also a dissapointment (even the fruit selecion hey had was sad like no watermelon???). The roast beef was so dry and chewy -_- Would never come back ever again since they dumbed down their food."}
{"text":"Good alternative to mandarin!

The best part about this restaurant is that the birthday eats for free (which was me in this case). The cost is reasonable considering it is AYCE and the atmosphere was excellent. The service was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

They have tons of dishes, from the usual noodles, chicken, pizza, to sushi, dumplings, and veges. The unique thing here is the wok - you fill your plate with raw veges and meat, and then they cook it for you with your choice if sauce - and this tastes pretty good! They also have cooked shrimps, steak, and fish - which is excellent value considering it's all you can eat. 

Overall, I will be back here for sure. I would recommend this restaurant to a friend as you can't beat the value of the food for the price you pay."}
{"text":"This is my favourite buffet. 
I always go here on my birthday (it's free) because I absolutely love getting to pick what I am eating. 
I am awfully picky and I also LOVE when my food is ridiculously spicy - so the fact that I can make my own raw plate and have them stir fry it for me is fantastic! 
Now their hot food section isn't the greatest but I don't think that's why their popular - if you're going for the hot food... Just order in or go to the Mandarin. This place is for fresh food that is made how you like it.
My husband also says the sushi is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I don't usually give buffets 4 stars, it's a buffet c'mon! This place is deserving for a few reasons! 
The interior is new nice and clean, plentiful staff who are constantly bussing tables, restocking and cleaning! On the weekends they have a live piano player, nice touch, be sure to tip them as well - just because it's a buffet doesn't mean you have to be cheap!!
What I like about this place is the Mongolian Wok station and the grill station; it's a healthier option than all the pre made food usually found at buffets. More Asian dishes than anything else, I liked that they didn't have an excessive amount of fried or finger foods! 
The desserts were OK, and just OK at that. Included with your meal was bottled water and soft drinks, although coffee and tea are not included. My fiancé was pleasantly surprised with his coffee, stating that it was pretty good and made his OK desserts a little better! 
I would definitely return to this buffet it a great place for groups, with something to please everyone."}
{"text":"Better quality than most buffets however they do not replenish their ready made items often and lack variety. Though most was tasty, I don't think it's worth what you pay when much of the food has gone cold/hard. Maybe this was a one off... Warm sushi and cold chicken shouldn't be a norm at a buffet."}
{"text":"Wok of Fame: The champagne of westernized Chinese buffets. Since I only gave it 3 stars, you can probably guess that these buffets are not my thing. It's always another person's plan, such as a family birthday, which brings me to these.

The good: Um, it beats the Mandarin in about every way. They have less standard 'Chinese food' dishes than the Mandarin (where's the lemon chicken?), but their edge is preparing various fresh dishes or meats. As their name suggests, you can have a make-your-own wok, fresh grilled steak, salmon, oysters and a couple other things. Also, they have quite a bit of sushi being constantly prepared and served fresh. It's actually pretty good and miles ahead of what the Mandarin puts out. Lots of ice cream choices and pretty big dessert bar.

The average and below average: First, the service. One thing I'll give the Mandarin is good service. Today, they lost our reservation, even though we made it clear as possible the day beforehand (even spelling the name letter by letter). Your table is visited less frequently and you often have old plates and napkins on your table for sometime. The food itself is generally average, with perhaps a couple things reaching a '4'. There isn't a single bite that gives you any 'wow' factor. It's basically your gluttonous impulses exciting you with so many food options, but upon reflection, little really stands out. That said, they don't put out much poor food either to their credit. Soft drinks and water bottles are included which adds a bit of value too.

I like the ambiance over the Mandarin. Nice decor, and warmer more relaxing colours. One possible downside is that it's completely open, so you may get more noise than some other places. It's also funny that the bathroom area moves to a Greco-Roman tile art motif, which has little to do with the attempted Asian feel of the rest of the place. I doubt anyone else cares however.

So if 'Chinese' buffets are your thing, give these guys a try. If a group suggests going to the Mandarin, try and persuade them to come here at least."}
{"text":"Was there last night with my children, normally on a Saturday I've experienced hot and tasty food. Unfortunately my food was mediocre and not as good as last time. Maybe it was a hit or miss yesterday but I won't be coming back for a while. 
My steak was very chewy and the Pepsi fountain tasted like diet. I'm usually an easy goer in restaurants, so this was interesting for me."}
{"text":"My parents took me here recently.  This place is huge and the food is so awesome!

We went on a Tuesday for lunch ($15.99/person) and got there at 11:45am.  The place was not too busy.  Neither the Wok nor Teppanyaki stations had a line up.  

This buffet is a bit different from other all-you-can eat buffets in that they have a Wok station where you pick out your raw ingredients and then bring it to the Wok station and choose a sauce, then they will stir fry it up for you right there (like a Mongolian Grill kind of place).  They also have regular buffet items, a small sushi section, a salad bar, soup section, desserts, scoop ice cream and soft serve ice cream.  The price of the buffet includes non-alcoholic beverages which you get yourself either from the small fridges or from the soda and juice foundations.  Alcoholic cocktails are dirt cheap at $2.99 each (I didn't have one, so can't say if they are good or not).  

The Wok station was my favourite.  I went 3 times.  I couldn't believe that they have straw mushrooms (I so love straw mushrooms).  They also have shitake mushrooms, chicken, beef, shrimp, Basa fish, squid, fried tofu and lots of veggies (broccoli, green and red peppers, zucchini, bok choy, baby corn, bean sprouts, and others).  Their noodle choices were egg noodles and udon.  They have about 7 different types of sauces to choose from.  I tried the Wok sauce, Kung Pao sauce, and Black Pepper sauce.  The Wok sauce was my favourite (really flavourful and not spicy).

Their sushi selection is small and was ok but nothing remarkable.  Their hot items were good.  I liked the Teriyaki chicken (not too salty like at most places), calamari (tender and not rubbery), and dim sum items (especially the shrimp har gow).  Unfortunately, the General Tao chicken was too dry and hard, as were their french fries.  Loved the coconut ice cream (rich and creamy), cream puffs (really soft with whipped cream filling) and Neapolitan pastry (custard filling with flaky Phyllo sheets).      

The decor is fancy and a little over the top, with huge chandeliers, a baby grand piano on a small circular platform in the middle of the dining area, goldfish pond, water foundation, you get the idea.  The place is very spacious.  Everything just looks very grand.

The people manning the Wok and Teppanyaki stations were really nice, and they cooked everything to perfection :)

The servers are really efficient at clearing your plates (sometimes too efficient, as I often had a few pieces of food left on my plate and was just taking a break and they came and took my plate away before I could say anything.  No big deal for me as I just went and got more).  They were also quick with bring the bill when we asked for it.    

Excellent food, excellent service and cool decor.  In a strip mall so lots of free parking.  Loved it.  Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Location: 7700 Hurontario St, Brampton ON L6Y 4M3
Price:$$-$$$
Service: Ehhh

I went to the buffet on a Tuesday and surprisingly it was soooo packed. It was weird to see so many people on a week day. You'll have to take the 401 and then the ON-10- either exit 44 or get off at Steeles Ave.

The ambiance of the place was very warm. You'll feel like you are having dinner under the canopy. The interior design is very nice!! They also have a piano right in the middle of the dinning area on a round stage- it was pretty cool. It was really fancy.. Muncho like.

Now on to the food... I feel like the buffet food was like another other- but the one thing that stood out was that they had live cooks in the middle of the buffet for you to order your food. Food that they cooked live ranged from noodles to rice to BBQ shrimp to thin slice steaks. By all means they still had rice, noodles and other food set up like a regular buffet- but when you were at the wok it is custom made to your taste. The food they made live was yummy. It reminded me a lot like a buffet I went to in Seattle.

Even though the food was good, my favourite was their dessert selection. What buffet do you go to that has a soft serve ice cream machine?!?! They had that there and  I nearly got chocolate wasted! They also have a refrigerator filled with mini cakes, puddings, and mousse cakes on individual plates. They have a variety of ice creams. Their dessert selection did not disappoint!

Verdict: Go Now!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on Valentines day. Once we were seated, I didn't see a waiter or waitress for the rest of our stay. Being that it was Valentines Day and my anniversary, I would have liked to order a \"real drink\" off the drink menu but no one came around.   

The price and the food were okay. There was a whole food section that was empty, but I guess they save that area for dinner. The live cooking section was pretty neat to watch. (I was a little worried about the fact that they have raw meat sitting out in a buffet for hours at a time though).   

When it was time to leave, I had to flag someone down to request the bill, being that we didn't seem to have a waiter or waitress.  

Overall we were unimpressed and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"was disappointed with this restaurant.went there for my daughter's grad celebration...nothing much food to choose from...the place is big that at gist glance you can see lots of food but when you go around there is nothing much to choose from..not coming back here to eat.."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place has gone downhill fast! We were there more than a year ago and found the food to be quite palatable, but this time...
 It was early during the lunch service and the first point to make is that the food at the \"self serve\" area was clearly not fresh. The wings, ribs, chicken and duck were stone cold and almost certainly left over from the night before. Because the dishes had only been heated by the warming pans they were all greasy as well as cold, and the overall effect was worse than if you were re-heating last night's delivered Chinese food in the microwave. The \"sirloin steak\" at the \"freshly prepared\" station was inedible gristle. It may have been \"sirloin tip\", but it certainly was not sirloin. The sushi was soggy and the raw fish did not look or taste fresh. The one decent part of the meal was the shrimp stir fry at the wok station...it was hot and seemed pretty fresh, although the black bean sauce was essentially watered down soy sauce, with little flavour. If it had been busier and the line-up at the wok station had been ridiculously long, as it often is, the entire meal would have been a rip-off.
 They have also added a $10 charge for \"wasted food\", which is a bit rich when 75% of the food on your plate is inedible. All in all, it was $20 for one OK plate of food; to call it poor value for the price is an understatement.
 To conclude, The Mandarin has officially reclaimed the title of \"Best AYCE Chinese buffet\", simply by maintaining its thoroughly mediocre standards."}
{"text":"Sub par. The woks and desserts were okay. Everything else was a fail. Never going back."}
{"text":"A good place for buffet without long line up for live cooking foods. Great deal for birthday person... Kids 5 and up are not worth it the price, especially going during holiday dinner time. 
Chinese foods are great.
Sushi rolls are not so great... Not fresh as seaweeds are soggy.
Soups, lots of varieties but missing some flavor (hot and sour soup is not sour or hot enough).
Live cooking is awesome! Watch out for your cholesterol.
Dessert, many selections including ice creams.

I would go back... Maybe without kids."}
{"text":"Great Asian buffet. Beautiful atmosphere and sushi was fresher than other Asian buffets.  Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"My favourite buffet thus far! I actually cried over the grilled food because it was that good. Yes, I cried! 

Great service and a huge selection of food. 
I made reservations for a party of 20+ and while there were a few late RSVP'ers, the restaurant was still very accommodating even if it was last minute. 

Our server was kind enough to do separate bills for such a huge table! 

No complaints - the decor, food, and overall atmosphere was amazing."}
{"text":"Food is much better than  Mandarin, more selection and the cook your own can't be beat.  Plus the soft drinks are included. The bad was the place was solid packed and so cold inside.  And also apparently no one watches or controls their children here.... I saw a kid ram full tilt into a man's  leg and spill his noodles all over him and the floor. Kids everywhere and handling everything and putting it back... I was a bit grossed out. So we don't go here often and have changed our minds when we've seen how packed it is and just go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I like this place...  but watch out for the live cooking station, some of the \"chefs\" are very bad in customer service.  I understand they have a long line, but at least be a bit more polite.  And the sashimi station is always low on fish, they refill very slowly and the pieces are very small.  It is a buffet don't limit your food.  Birthday \"day\" is free for that person with at least one guest, and I love to go there if my or my husband's birthday lands on a weekend.  Besides that, it is quite pricey for my taste now since they raise the price."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and most recently for dinner with a birthday person.  Adults on Wednesday night costs $25.99   now the birthday person is free. That's the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars. If birthday wasnt free I'd never pay this price for its food. Here's why:

Food:

Cooking station.  You pick raw stuff, marinated beef, chicken, fish, tofu, noodles, veggies which are all very fresh and healthy.  Then you give it to the cook and pick a sauce.  He boils it then stir fries everything in the wok.   Now this is where things can go wrong. Depending on the skill level of that cook, you end result can be a very amazing dish like an authentic Asian style stir fry or a sloppy mess.  My last 2 dishes had too much sauce, drowning out everything. Failed

Sushi:  the rice right of the bat i can tell is not proper sushi rice.  Or the cook really didn't know how to cook Japanese sushi style rice.  The rolls are all non authentic Japanese style. More catered to people that don't like raw stuff.  They have 3 types of sashimi you can pick from. It's self serve and theres plenty left. That alone tells you it isn't good or else they'd have to limit the quantity to 2 pieces each. Like other real buffets. The salmon sashimi color was light pale pink. Not the beautiful salmon raw color. 

Teppanyaki :. It looks amazing with two cooks cooking sirloin steaks and mussels and shrimp with garlic and butter and soya sauce.  Until you bite into it.  Mussels were tough, sirloin was tasteless and tough, and the shrimps weren't even fresh. You can tell when I tried to pull the tail shell off , it wouldn't budge at all. You bite into it , it lacks the bouncy texture and was mushy. 

Cooked food:. It seemed like a lot, but it was all fried stuff.  Chicken wings, roast beef (tough), veggies 

Salad: the usual not too much selection. 

Basically the price is too high for a few dishes of stir fries   your money is better spent at Spoonand Fork, JJ's, Dragon Dynasty etc"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and an interesting concept. Truly trying to sell an experience. The food does taste good. The only drawback for me is the forced clearing of our plates; they want you in and out fast.

We were at an office lunch and surely enjoyed the food. Tried the self-serve wok and the chef did a great job putting my meal together.

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and despite the crowd it was not as noisy as Mandarin or Imperial.

The only thing I was a little annoyed is that the servers try to clear the table whether you are done or not; holds the plate and asks whether to clear it. I was half done with my plate and had paused a little to strike up a conversation with my colleagues. Servers assume that you are done.

The price is on par with Mandarin but I find it reasonable for the experience."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today because they give free birthday meals and I was very impressed. I'll probably come back before my next birthday and actually pay for my meal! 
For the free birthday meal, you have to tell them as you're getting seated so they can check your ID. You can only get it on the day of your birthday and you can come with any party size! I regret coming for lunch because there's a larger selection at dinner time. 
The service was great. The employees were quick at taking away my plates while I was away from my table. All the employees were very friendly as well. I saw a customer forget her jacket as she was leaving the restaurant and an employee ran after her to give it to her. I really appreciate that kind of service! 
Now let's talk about the food: 
Sushi: only had sushi rolls for lunch but good selection and quality, way better than Mandarin sushi! I'm a big fan.
Custom Woks: I was so impressed with this station. They had chicken, beef, shrimp, fish, imitation crab, udon noodles, egg noodles, and a wide variety of veggies! You put whatever you want onto a plate and give it to the worker at the wok station and he boils then stir frys it for you in the sauce of your choice. It's so quick and delicious.
Teppanyaki: the basa and tilapia were good, cooked perfectly and seasoned well. Very garlic-y. The beef was ok. I don't recommend it. 
Dim Sum: the sui mai was ok but the har gows was good! 
Chicken Wings: one of my favourites, really crispy. 
Desserts: they have a wide variety of pudding, fruit, ice cream, and pastries. I liked the caramel pudding and ice cream the best. Their soft serve ice cream was so good, comes in vanilla, chocolate, and twist. You get to do it yourself too.
Come here for dinner on your birthday and have a free delicious meal! You won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"I must admit, I was quite surprised by this place.  My friend wanted to go to this place as it was his birthday, so it was a freebie for him.  I, on the other hand, had to pay $20 for weekend lunch.  It is a bit pricey for a self serve buffet, but the selection and quality were much better than Mandarin.  Also, they have a soft serve ice cream machine and all you can drink included plus a live cooking station.

Good items: sashimi, any roll with spicy mayo drizzled on top, dim sum, fish fillet, lychee dessert, soft serve ice cream

Avoid: Sirloin steak from live cooking station.

Now, don't get me wrong here, it's not amazing, but it's definitely one of the better self serve buffets.  Much better than Wassabi."}
{"text":"Long line ups on the weekend during dinner; but reservation is easy to make on the day of.
Overall quality of the food from the buffet table is slightly above average.
Food from the grill stations is great and food from live cooking station is hit or miss.
Deserts are below average.
Free water bottles and drinks from soft drinks machine which are all self serve, so the server only takes your plates away so cant really comment much about customer service.

Would return another day."}
{"text":"Mediocre food quality.  Long busy lineups. Sushi is below par. Crab is bad and shrimp is barely eatable.  Wok grill was good and deserts had lots of variety.  I would not go again."}
{"text":"Imagine an upscale Mandarin. After this place you would never go to mandarin again. 
Service : good. Servers pickup your plates quickly. They welcome you to the establishment and seat you down.
Food: water n pop is included in the price. Sushi buffet is good and worth a try. (Try the butter fish). Live cooking is well done. (Mussels were overdone though). Make your own stir fry is good. (Basically choose your protein, veggies & carbs and they will make a stir fry). The fried foods at the back are not worth it. Loads of sweet dishes like pastries and cakes to try from. 
The place looks good and its an awesome place to go with your friends and family."}
{"text":"I am not sure if I caught this on a bad day but I have to say that my experience puts Wok of Fame as one of the bottom of the barrel paces to get Chinese food.  I went on a Friday for lunch which you would think would be pretty busy seeing as there are a lot of businesses in the area.  I was quite excited as I hadn't been to a Chinese buffet in quite a while.  Although the selection of actual Chinese food isn't as extensive as some places there is much more selection combines with all the other choices.  At the hot table most of the plates were almost empty but none the less there was enough to fill my plate.  What little food that was left was super hot and seemed fresh.  My second round I approached the wok station.  I filled my plate with the raw ingredients then passed them to the chef.  Al though I chose the sauce my plate seemed a bit tasteless.  My noodles were way over cooked, my veggies under cooked and my meat was rubbery.  I barely made it through half the plate and left the rest for garbage.  My third visit to the buffet brought me to the sushi.  Oh how I was excited for sushi.  I grabbed multiple pieces of various different kinds of sushi.  My first choices was the chicken maki roll.  Well ive had my fair share of sushi and the chicken that they used was chicken salad as you would put in a sandwich.  It was horrible.  The rest of the sushi was super hard as it seemed like it had been sitting out for quite a while.  Another epic fail.  So I resulted to salad and of course most of the lettuce was brown and wilted but was able to find enough to fill my plate.  I really hope that I caught Wok of Fame on a bad day because if they keep this up they will scare away all customers."}
{"text":"A very large buffet place and was quite busy on a Sunday night.  Drinks (bottled water and fountain drinks) were all you can drink.  They had live cooking where you grab a plate of raw food and bring to the chef and then they would cook it on the spot.  Quite a nice experience, but the food was average.  It was a typical AYCE.  Reminds me of dragon legend which I would choose over this one."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for her birthday lunch. Birthday guests eat free and there is no minimum table size to claim it. So in the end the price was only 17+ tax/tip. Worth it in that situation.

The food was actually decent, the wok where you pick your own ingredients and let them cook it for you with different sauces was definitely a nice experience. Their chicken and sirloin steaks on teppenyaki was also made real well.

 Their hot foods were not too salty which was nice.

Sushi was alright, not the best. But that's expected from all buffets of this kind, unless if you go to an actual ayce sushi restaurant.

Overall, without the free birthday meal, it's definitely still a steep price, but in general the food tasted pretty good for a buffet."}
{"text":"When you walk in, your treated to an amazing decor of turtles and coy in a lovely indoor pond. Then you're brought to your table where there's an explanation of the stations, but with so much going on, you might miss out on the explanations. 
So exploring is fun - each station with more food than one could imagine, but unless you know what's up for the fresh meat stations you may be lost in figuring out how it works (as the chefs are too busy preparing the foods and to ask someone in line how it works might be met with a snarl in case they think you're taking their spot in line). The seafood was fresh, the dessert (if there's room) can be hit and miss (ice cream is usually safe!), and if you spot the dim sum bar hidden in the back past all the other stations then you'll find amazing pot stickers and har how. But that's near the bathroom past desserts which makes the layout a little too overwhelming that you'll miss it after the pasta bar the chicken wings the everything North American til you get to what would make it Asian -American cuisine to match the decor. 

Definitely come hungry - impossible to leave hungry."}
{"text":"It's food. There's not muh to say about it. In terms of price to food quality, price is higher than food quality and it costs way too much to eat here.

The 'live cooking' is all youre really paying for. But to pay anything for just meat cooked in front of you for the price tou're paying is just a bit too much."}
{"text":"The food and options here are better than Madarin. I especially like the freshly cooked food. It was loud and it felt more like a cafeteria setting than Mandarin. The servers were not as friendly but still very efficient. Maybe too efficient. I got up to hug someone as it was our staff Christmas partly and my plate of food got taken away. I would also have to say the drinks are not as good as Mandarin. The sashimi was really good...fresh and large in size."}
{"text":"This place is huge! Tons of seating which means lots of people which means it is loud in here! You have to almost yell at the person next to you in order for them to hear you. 

Went on a busy Friday night for dinner. Service was average. Ordered a bottle of Jackson-Triggs white wine. When we ordered a second bottle, our server just slapped it on the table and immediately said \"It's the one you ordered it's just in a different bottle\". Maybe she thought we wouldn't notice? When we told her it isn't the one we ordered she made a face and said she would go check the order. Came back a few minutes later with the right one but no apology whatsoever. Aside from this, the servers were constantly coming by to pick up finished plates which was good.

Onto the food!

Had to try the wok station since it's what the place is known for. Grab a plate and choose from a selection of udon or yellow flat noodles with veggies such as bean sprouts, green bell pepper, onions, and mushrooms. Meat choices of either shrimp, beef, or chicken but to be quite honest the raw chicken in a large bowl just sitting there is kind of off putting. The dish will be served to you on that same plate so be sure not to place the raw chicken directly on it. I had udon noodles with shrimp and Thai chili sauce. It is marked 2 chilies which is one of the most spicy sauces on the menu but it was not spicy at all. Very tasty though. 

Other dinner items I tried:

- Sushi: Surprisingly good for a self serve buffet. They have salmon sashimi and rolls such as California, red dragon, green dragon, and cucumber. Tasted quite fresh. I appreciated the spicy mayo they had available beside the sushi station. 

- Garlic steak from the fry station: Was OK. Tasted bland despite the overwhelming amount of garlic. 

- Salmon from the fry station: Meh. Very oily and flavourless. 

- Teriyaki salmon: Quite good. Nice flavour. 

- Hot crab legs: Small and incredibly salty to the point I couldn't eat it. Nothing compared to the crab legs at Mandarin which I really enjoy. 

- Crispy duck: Very yummy if you don't eat the extremely thick and fatty skin. The meat was very flavourful and moist. Some pieces such as the leg didn't have such fatty skin so it was edible and tasty skin on. 

- Fried chicken wings: A tad on the salty side but very nice and crispy. 

Desserts:

- Mini pancakes: Looks cute but that's about it. Had a strange aftertaste. 

- Tiramisu cake: A let down. Soggy and no flavour. 

- Mocha cake: Pretty tasty. Sponge was a bit dry but the creamy mocha icing made up for that. 

- Creme brulee: Disgusting. Tasted awful. Looked and tasted like pure cornstarch with water. No cream in sight. Top tasted like gas from the flame torch. 

- Strawberries covered with chocolate from the chocolate fountain: Enjoyed it. Milk chocolate. 

Green tea and red bean ice cream: Very good. Just like the kind from sushi restaurants. 

Coconut ice cream: Did not enjoy. Tasted like very artificial coconut flavour. 

Mint chocolate chip ice cream: Very minty and not too sweet. Almost like toothpaste. 

Fresh pineapple, cantaloupe, watermelon, grapefruit, grapes: Can't go wrong with fresh fruit. 

Overall the food was comparable to any other buffet. Not bad but not great either. Compared to Mandarin their sushi was much better but their desserts were very lacking."}
{"text":"As good as it gets..Worth every penny..we went with my coworkers on Friday for dinner..
its a nice atmosphere for a buffet place and perfect ambiance..spacious, friendly ,Kids playroom, VIP room, fresh fortune cookie..
 lots of choices in food (Teppanyaki, Sushi bar,Salad bar, Dessert bar, Hot Table) and like how they cook it in front..we rarely see any buffet places cooking in front and the freshness of the ingredients..
will be back"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday, was pretty excited to try this place from what I heard. place was huge and food selection was pretty big. Quality of food was pretty average... especially the steaks... which were actually pretty tough(not surprised). Unlimited self serve juices/soft drinks/bottled water was a plus."}
{"text":"Love their food better than spoonful and mandarin. Lots of selection live bar as well. Only disappointment is icecream. Many flavors but not well maintained its at almost at room temperature."}
{"text":"I visited Wok of fame on Saturday for my birthday and came away not so pleased. 

Pros

- very nice decor and interior design of the restaurant. 

- big selection of different types of food. 

-Free fountain drinks and bottled spring water

-Free meal on your Birthday

Cons

- Taste of food is not so good. 

- Cold pre-prepared food (teriyaki and general tsao chicken)

Decent place nothing special. I'd rather eat at Mandarin, just my opinion."}
{"text":"The place  was big ... nicely  decorated  ... and the food  ... not impressed. It does have lots of desserts though."}
{"text":"We used to visit regularly for lunch since there were the same items we like as at dinner but for a lower price. The stir fry bar is the reason to come here but if it's busy there might be some standing around. The grill is pretty good to. The prepared buffet is average to slightly sub-par. Certainly a good place to check out, particularly at lunch."}
{"text":"It is as huge as an adventure island of food , seating may be 200 plus with plush buffet n over 170 items.
We started our adventure with live counters for starters with hot n spicy steak , chilly shrimps n grilled mussels .
Rolled to sushi buffet with crab sashimi to nigiri to California rolls , sushi wasn't upto the marked n was not as fresh as it should be ! Needs improvement !
Main course I tried grilled pork chops , steamed fish, see through dim-sums, crab legs garlic , pasta noodles n tso  chicken !
Asian beef curry was nice .
To dessert it was another lavish spread including mango cheese cake , green tea cake cream filled patty fruits with whipped cream , caramel custard coconut macaroons n much more !
It is great in quantity n numbers of items but the food quality was average !
Good for impressing guests to a plush restaurant .
Price wise good n affordable !"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been here for dinner, and during the week too.  I think many people come here for the free birthday meal.  It is definitely a good deal.  2 adults  = $30 for dinner.  

They put everyone on the right side of the restaurant, and it was full.  Got the feeling they were   short on staff.  The hot food line around the corner from the ice cream/minnie mouse was actually closed, which was a surprise to me.  Typically dinners have more selections, so more $ and It seemed the opposite.  They did have prime rib, and I wanted to try a piece to see how it compares to Mandarin.   To be fair, there were only couple little bites that were chewable, as I got the end piece, so hard to comment.   

The stir fry station is the main thing I like coming here and it was good as usual.  The soft ice cream is a plus as well!   I don't usually like fruits at buffets, but the watermelon was very nice. Peach and mandarin orange are good choices to have too.  I don't really bother with the live cooking section, as I have had it in the past and found the meat hard to chew.  Looking at the table beside us, it seemed still is.  You can't expect an all you can eat place to offer the best meats.   But I might try some mussels next time.

Overall, it was still a good experience and value. But, I was a bit disappointed in what seemed like less food choices.  Stir fry # 1 reason, and #2 is the more choices they offer compared to other similar buffets I prefer this place.   We will be coming back next week for sons birthday party, so hope they do not close down the 1 food section as they did for dinner."}
{"text":"We went to this location on Mother's day at 1:30pm.
What a horrible experience. Packed, lines for the buffet were 30mins+ because they seated people at specific times so intake seating was all at the same time. I would prefer Mandarin as opposed to this establishment. 
Horrid planned seating times but clever money saving. Had I not been there for another person's special occasion I would have left within seconds of entering the door. 
Food was disappointing, nothing stood out or was vaguely appetizing. After 1 partial plate of sushi and hot foods I opted to save myself any further annoyance and skip the rest. The desserts were enjoyed by those with me but once more it's was nothing outstanding.
At $32.50 a person, this was certainly NOT worth it."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets I have been to ever.

I would give it a 5 but the deserts and hot table are not that great.

The live cooking station is amazing and the included pop in price is also great.

Staff can be hit and miss. But this place is the BOMB!

I recommend to all"}
{"text":"Something about this place gets me.

I have been to this buffet with my family for occasions and sometimes to eat out with my friends.

I really love the ambiance of this restaurant but every time i go it's always packed! 
Well it is an all you can eat buffet and the price is probably the same price as Mandarin.  One thing i love about this buffet is their steak.  It's not as fascinating much to see how they cook their steak but watching them put that butter garlic on top of the steak is just savory. I would actually go back at least twice before i get O.D with the steak. I usually come to this restaurant during evenings, yes! ALL YOU CAN EAT CRAB LEGS. I love their crab legs, usually when they're cold.  But for some reason, i barely touch their hot food. Even their Sushi, i barely touch cause the last time i had their sushi...im pretty sure i had food poisoning. 

The service i would give 4/5, they pick up your plate as soon as they see its empty or when you're done with it. I love how you can get up and serve your self with your own drinks (aside from the alchy), you can even take home a non opened water bottle, apple or orange juice home.  

I would come back to this place but i'm hoping that the next time i come....it's not packed. I guess it is better to come there during the weekdays."}
{"text":"Live cooking station delivers the goods.

I'm normally not a fan of going to an ayce Asian food, unless it's sushi, but this place has changed my mind only b/c of one of their 1 buffet station.

You have you're usual buffet stations, Canadian Chinese, soup, sushi/sashimi, dessert, drink station with bottled water and juices, Mongolain grill, or my favourite the made to order grill. 

The food in the Canadian Chinese and soup station is anything you would get at Mandarin, wonton soup, chicken balls, noodles, fried rice etc. The sushi/sashimi station was very good, the fish tasted very fresh however there was too much rice on the maki rolls. My favourite station was the made to order grill. The choices for the grill were steak, kalbi, chicken, shrimp, salmon, mussels and another type of fish. This station alone won me over and is the only reason I want to keep coming back for more. That tender taste of the meat and the garlic teriyaki sauce that they put on the food is to die for.

Only been here for dinner and you're looking at an easy $20. 

Items to definitely get:

- kalbi
- grilled shrimp
- steak
- grilled mussels
- grilled salmon"}
{"text":"I wonder why Yelp has censored some of the reviews of this restaurant. Two reviews that gave it 1 star out of 5 have disappeared as well as my initial review (3 stars) and follow up review (2 stars). This is bound to be a controversial restaurant. Some people will be dazzled by the decor and will love it. Other people will notice that the food is not as good as other restaurants. The sushi pales when compared to the sushi at the best AYCE restaurants in Brampton including Hockey Sushi which is in the same mall. The cooked food, salad bar and deserts are not as good as The Mandarin. I have twice tried the food in the \"Live Cooking\" area and found it to be bland. 

Some people will love this place and others will hate it. No restaurant can please everyone. Still I am puzzled that Yelp has deleted some reviews by people who did not like the place, but did not delete the rave review by Brian H who did not seem to try the food and wrote about Wok Of Fame's expansion plans."}
{"text":"Its really hard to give this restaurant any stars. The food was terrible. When we complained to the management they said it was because the dishwasher broke. Not sure how that makes the food bad but that was the excuse. There was nobody serving at the roast beef station, the chicken teriyaki was so salty and the sushi looked like I made it and Ive never made sushi in my life. Ruined my daughters birthday! We left and told them we couldnt justify spending that kind of money on garbage!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place... The food is OK nothing impressive or there is not much varsity of food. It is just that it is pricy. I came on Saturday for friend bday and I end up paying 40 buck for a meal. That is alot. I never paid for all u can eat this much. The food is decent I really like the mean and chicken which they cook fresh. They have ice cream machine which I like as well. The sushi is not as good if u want sushi go to all u can eat sushi no here ."}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday for lunch around 1:30 on a Saturday.  Love the fact its free on your birthday :)  Already good things.

This place is massive! With so many choices.  There is a live wok, where like mongolian grill's, you build a plate, give it to them and they cook it live and fresh.   

They also have a steak, and chicken grill, where they will cook it fresh.

Huge fresh sushi area, where you can see them prepare the sushi, lots of our typical buffet items, more on the westernized Chinese choices.  LOVED they had Dim Sum too.
All items were very hot, and replenished fast.

HUGE dessert selection.  Ice creams, cakes, sundae bar.  Waffle station.  

The only thing was the salad bar was lacking I found.  Not much choices in vegetables, fruits, and dressings.

Loved that soft drinks was included, as well as bottled water.  Very rare.  Great add on.

I found our plates were cleared very fast and efficient."}
{"text":"So so Chinese buffet. Has a live cooking station but wait times can be brutal. Most of the items are similar to mandarin (chicken wings, balls, breaded shrimp etc)

Sushi is better though than mandarin because they serve raw fish. 

Deserts are meh. Don't even bother.

$19.99 for weekend lunch, drinks included. 

MIGHT come back in a year or so"}
{"text":"So I've never been here before nor did I ever have a desire to.  My parents are frequent eaters here aka they never miss the perk of eating here for free on their birthdays. Where else would my mom plan my dad's big 65th birthday celebration?  Why here of course!  My mom made a reservation for 25 at 11:30 am on a Saturday morning.  I decided (as did everyone else) to forego breakfast.  OBVIOUSLY.  But seriously, ew to having such a heavy meals(sss) so damn early.

I totally forgot to take any pictures of my plates and the restaurant.  The restaurant is huge by the way and surprisingly really busy already at 11:30am. I had no idea what I was doing with the stir-fry section but luckily my friend had been before, so I followed her lead.  You basically load your plate with all sorts of raw items and give it to the chefs at the stir-fry station.  You then pick a sauce and they toss it all together for you. Simple!  They do this all in like 5 minutes so I never saw huge line-ups.  I got the black bean sauce, which is usually what I like in restaurants.  It was pretty good.  I wish I got more stir-fry but I didn't want to fill up on it.  I then got a plate of green beans, bbq pork, beef stew, general tao chicken and a piece of \"bbq\" chicken.  Vito everything except the beef stew. Ugh, I'm regretting it now.  I should've got a whole plate of beef stew with white rice.  Dammit.  The beef was so tender and full of flavour.  Think beef brisket. Oh god, yes. Anyways, I wasn't too interested with any of the dessert.  I'm glad they had an assortment of ice cream flavours and they even had my fave, cappuccino!  I would've liked to get a waffle while it was piping hot, but they stock pile them under a heating lamp.  Carrot cake was dryer than cardboard so avoid this.  Japanese strawberry cheesecake was no uncle tetsu's, but edible.

I'd never come here on my own terms but I wouldn't mind if I had to come for a party.  This place is just whatever.  OH, before I forget to mention, I do love that they have a fridge of unlimited spring water.  *thumbs up"}
{"text":"This is an alternative to Mandarin. A bit different but still good. They do rush people though. It's buffet style. Not a fan of the wok method they use. It's boiled real quick and then stir fried with sauce."}
{"text":"This buffet is horrible. It is a more asian inspired buffet in comparison to Mandarin or Dragon Pearl.

The foods here are similar to Mandarin, and comparable in the variety to some degree. The restaurant even has a teppanyaki area that lets you make a stir-fry fresh, sirloin steak, and other seafood.

The biggest problems with the restaurant is the layout and food quality. The restaurant is a larger buffet, so it allows for more people in there, and more space to move. That hinders this buffet because the food is spread out in weird places and you can't find what you want. As well, the food is mass produced to a larger extent since it accommodates to larger number of consumers. All the dishes I tried were horrible, and the one gimmick of the teppanyaki was bland and disappointing.

The teppanyaki area leaves raw meat out in the open, and one can only suppose what germ filled hands and young children can do to that.

There is also free bottled water and free fountain drinks on the side, but honestly it takes very minimal charge to supply soft drinks.

I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Went here last night with Walter and Eliza, the food and company was great. I liked the wok bar, and teppanyaki stations. The salad station was awesome, they didn't scrimp on cheese on the salads, nor the selection of high end veggies. Everything was fresh it reminded me of table at a farmers market.

The prepared dishes were very tasty, and were refilled pretty quickly when they got low. I would like a few more spicy dishes, like a spicy eggplant, Ma po tofu, or a general tso chicken my favorite!!! 

The steam dumplings were were also a nice touch, and there prime rib was juicy and succulent. 

I did like the fact you get your own soda, water and juice, it was easy to swing by after a full plate to restock the beverage of your choice. 

The dessert selection was adequate, the standard ice cream bar, but the did have green tea and red bean ice cream which was a nice touch. They had mango moose cake, black forest back, good selection of fresh and a few canned fruit items.

Think the trick is go through the week, the longest I stood in line was at tops 5 minutes, waiting for my food to cook. 

I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Great service, nice servers. Great variety of food for lunch time. The price was not bad for a lunch buffet. The awesome thing was... the live cuisine. Good guy always smiling and nice and very quick at cooking
Nice ambiance. Love the nice feel of Asia with their fish  in the tanks and the small pool. 

Worth going in again"}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday dinner on a Friday night as my actual birthday fell on a Friday. I had a lovely time. As you enter they give you a tour of the buffet as well as instruct you for the live cooking stations. The food was tasty. There is a wide selection of appetizers, main dishes, sushi and dessert. The staff members were friendly and quick with cleaning up plates, etc. There was live piano playing which was nice. It is a classier and cleaner environment than some of its competitors. The price is a little higher but as I went on my birthday it was well worth it ! 
I can't wait to go back! We had so much fun"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time yesterday and really liked it! OMG soft ice cream machine! OMG TWO chocolate fountains, 1 milk, 1 white! Everywhere I turned there was something that compelled me to point and say to my friend \"OMG look they have {insert cool feature here} too!\". There is lots of room around the large tables and the place is nicely laid out with fancy decor. They haven't completely covered the industrial ceiling which isn't that great but it isn't really a big deal. There was a gentleman playing the piano throughout our meal and despite all the cooking there was very little smoke or smell. A bonus was that my meal was free because it was my birthday! Three kinds of juice, bottled water and fountain drinks are included in the buffet price and they have a pretty big selection of desserts. All of the food I ate was tasty. I found their sushi selection better than the sushi at the Mandarin, they actually has some sashimi which Mandarin doesn't. The service was good and the server had no problem splitting our bill. If you are in the Brampton area looking for a buffet you should definitely give Wok of Fame a try!"}
{"text":"Avoid weekends. The food/desserts finish up really fast... and they don't replenish. Add to it, the higher price. Basically, I am only ever coming back here to get a free birthday meal. 

The creme brulee was done by the time I ended my meal. I really wanted some so I tried speaking with the staff. 

1. They don't speak english
2. They are extremely rude and unhelpful"}
{"text":"Typical asian buffet food, nothing special to separate it from Spoonful or Mandarin except that it is a bit more spacious inside."}
{"text":"The first time I came in, I really liked the variety of Chinese foods. You were able to watch your food being made in front of your eyes which I thought was unique and that brought in some specialty to your food. The overall food quality of the food was great, however when it came to dessert I picked up a waffle and when I ate it, it was ice cold. I complained and they offered me a hot one..I wasn't too concerned because maybe the woman forgot to throw this one out. It wasn't such a big deal.

I really liked how the servers were attentive and consistently took our plates away. And brought our drinks fast and prepared right.

SECOND TIME ----

The second time I went to Wok of Fame, we were put on a wait list but for some reason...I would've gladly waited for a better table, but they sat us in this awkward in the middle of everyone table for two. I know they just took tables apart and just put two chairs together in the middle of the section. It was a FIRST DATE too..so we both laughed at the awkward seating. However, we got over it and got our food. No problem with the food once again, but the servers just kept rushing it and constantly reminding us that we had a 1.5 hour limit."}
{"text":"We've been enjoying the Wok of fame for casual events for awhile - 

The flexibility as a buffet has always been enjoyable for vegetarians though I feel if you're there during the week they do limit the number of selections given the traffic 

The hot table steaks are thinner but enjoyable though be sure to call out if you prefer a less well done cut - and the seafood side though the tend to overcook the fish 

I'm impressed with the Wok station as a feature and being able to customize your mix means there's something for everyone 

Notably I do enjoy the crispy chicken as it could pass for duck - and sashimi quality salmon and butterfish are a nice touch ... but a nice cold table for salads was also a nice surprise at its choice and breadth 

The desserts are hit and miss - the creme brûlée is laughable though the mousses are very enjoyable - I'm particularly fond of the coconut and caramel 

As far as buffets go - there's seemingly more action than a mandarin though without the feeding trough ambiance"}
{"text":"Fun an GIGANTIC buffet that make you feel like you're in a fancy Vegas hotel/casino. Very nice place and plenty of tables; we were 5 with no reservation and got a table within 5 minutes on a busy new year's eve night.  Grand piano in the middle with live music. Great selection with lobster, crab legs, sushi, sashimi, teppanyaki grill, roast beef, peking duck and fridges filled with bottled drinks that you can grab yourself. Although the selection and service was great, the food however wasn't the most tasty that we've had from a buffet.  Poor selection of dessert, not many cake and sweet option. Great vibe. WIll come back."}
{"text":"A very nice place for a good dinning!!!
Definitely worth visiting many more times.

A specious restaurant with lovely interior. Wide choices of food sections. They have Sushi section, hot food section, dessert and fruit section, ice cream corner and most interesting live cooking sections. Yes, there are 2 live cooking sections. In one, you can pick the raw foods (shrimp, crab meat, fish, meat, mushroom, bamboo-shoots, baby corn... and dozen more) and select the sauce (from 8 choices) and they will cook it in front of you. In the other section, they are cooking salmons, beef steaks, mussel... and you can grab it right from the stovetop. 

Service is good and they are quite prompt in cleaning your used plates. Good location with ample parking spaces."}
{"text":"So we went for my niece Birthday party at Wok of Fame.  There are about 20 of us and I have to say this is one of the best buffet in Ontario.

It is really busy if you show up after 7pm.  Luckily we they made a reservation so we show up around 8 and we got our table.

I love the live cooking experiences.  The best stir fry live cooking experience ever.  You pick your own noodle and vegetable and meat then you go to the chef station and tell them what sauce you like and they stir fry your dish for you while you wait.  

I also like the live cooking of steak, salmon, shrimp and mussel.  I love the fresh taste and the way it grilled.

I also love the BBQ duck, they have so much of it and the duck is so fresh and creamy and tasty.

One thing like really like the most is that they do not rush you out or give you a time limit.  Unlike other buffet places, they give you 2 hours limit.

The service is excellent!

I will go back for my Birthday!"}
{"text":"Wow what a huge lovely buffet!  Beautiful decor combined with a huge selection of food.

The hot food selection is just average, but the cook to order stations is what really stands out : Stir fry (pick your raw foods from the boat and your sauce preference) and Grill (sirloin steak, tilapia, basa, chicken).

They've got lots of desserts to choose from including the largest salad bar I've ever seen at a buffet!  They also have chocolate and vanilla fountain fondues!  (during weekend dinner only)

I noticed the chef at the stir fry doesn't speak english or cantonese, which is a disappointment as I couldn't communicate with him (wanted to ask which sauce is most popular).  Otherwise the staff is friendly.

Be sure to make reservations because sometimes they can get full.  It's a bit pricey on weekends but a great fancy place for large gatherings.  Free for birthday person! (with ID)

I really enjoyed this place!  Will return soon!"}
{"text":"They stand behind their product.

We recently had a problem with something that did not agree... not pleasant but we discussed the issue with management and were very happy with the way they explained their processes and they made us feel very good about the restaurant.

I've dealt with restaurants in the past that were not willing to discuss this kind of issue - they have received quite critical reviews from me. In this case I'm saying this is a stand-up place - I probably won't eat there for a while but I don't think that should stop anyone else!

Well done Wok of Fame!"}
{"text":"Great selection of food, much better quality + atmosphere than other Chinese buffets around. Much better food quality than Madarin. Can feel a bit overwhelming in the dining rooms bc its always rather busy but it doesn't stop us from enjoying our meal or coming back many times. Great for groups too. Love it here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the buffet here. I love that their drinks are free for all and you can even help yourself to bottled water from the fridge. I guess my only gripe is the desserts were not very good at all. I want to go back!!"}
{"text":"I like buffets for its no frills, pick what you want in the amount you think you need option only to repeat again and again until you've had your fill.

Is it better than Mandarin? Food-wise, yes. Service-wise, no. Why go? Because it's a safe option for family dinners with varied likes and dislikes, allergies, etc. 

We were able sit quickly upon entering with a party of 10. The place has a large capacity, but it meant line-ups at each food stations which can annoying after the first turn."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to go to Wok of Fame just because we have never been there before. We got there at 2:00 pm and the place closes for lunch at 3:00 pm which we thought was fine, we were reminded at least five times during our meal that they were closing at 3:00 pm. The service was terrible, the food was cold and tasteless. The live cooking was great, which is where the two stars come into play. The decor is great but the staff need to keep an eye on children and customers throwing food into the ponds. 

I didn't end up tipping because the staff were so rude, they didn't come and clear our table once and then the waitresss came back at 2:45 pm and asked us to pay now. I told her no, we are still eating and that we will come to her when we are done. She then reminded us yet again that they close at three pm. 

All in all this place is terrible. I would not go back but I do now know that they close their lunch buffet at three, thanks Wok of Fame staff!"}
{"text":"Huge buffet with an enormous amount of seating.. pricing is a little high but it comes with a large variety of food to choose from as well as pop/juice/bottled water included.

Seating time is limited to 2 hours.. though I'm not sure how often they enforce it.

Tons of food to choose from.. and as it is quite a busy buffet, the food is often hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese/Canadian buffets I've ever been. What makes this buffet different is the live cooking and the freedom of serving yourself soft drinks and juices. There are so many different options to choose from. Everything is so fresh and tasty. They need to open a location in Toronto. The staff was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"An asian Buffet with an absolutely wonderful setup and atmosphere and the food is a million leagues above mandarin; which I guess isn't saying much, but it's definitely worth a visit if you are a fan of buffet restaurants. Many options, including those of freshly prepared hot meals."}
{"text":"Note:  If you're visiting between December 1st - January 1st, \"Holiday\" pricing is in effect, re:  be prepped to shell out a few dollars more pp!!!  It was $31.99 for dinner.

If you're Asian, live in GTA-West (Brampton, Mississauga, Oakville), and tend to celebrate bdays in a group, you'll probably end up at Wok Of Fame.  True story.  Why?  Because bday person eats for FREE here and there's no minimum number of people in your party in order to qualify.  Keepin' the qualifications low.

Yes, Wok Of Fame is HUGE.  I've never been to Vegas, but this place reminded me of buffets at a resort...'cept that the fruits aren't that tropical looking.  ;)  Buffet is divided into different sections, re:  Salad (most weren't good), Cooked Westernised Brown Foods (noodles, fried rice, egg rolls, chicken nuggets), \"Sushi\", Soups (none looked appetising to me), Another Section of Brownish Cooked Foods with Crispy Chicken, Duck, Roast Beef, Fries, Pizza, etc., a large, Dessert Section, & the section in the centre is for Live Cooking.

(There was another \"Raw Foods\" section which creeped me out 'cause it also had raw beef/chicken, BUT I found out that you scoop what you want on a plate, hand to the Live Cooking station, select a sauce, and they stir fry something for you!  Thank God 'cause I was about to comment that this section was a lawsuit waiting to happen.)

I never took advantage of the Live Cooking 'cause I just ate a part of my mom's steak which although thin, was quite large.

FOOD - Not impressed, but edible.  Although there's A LOT, I didn't find many things appetising.  There was also a lot of fakey foods/shortcuts like cut canned beets, fried scallops weren't actual scallops, and don't even get me started with the desserts.  They looked like something from a Play-Doh playset.  Soft-serve was melty, ice cream tasted slightly chemically, and I NEVER touched anything that was in those fridges.  Fruits weren't ripe enough colour.

I don't eat much the carbs at buffets, so I never tried the Fried Noodles/Rice, but they looks dry.

SERVICE - Fine.  I saw a coupla servers even crack a smile!

Overall, your rating will depend on your expectation.  If you expect this food wonderland, are impressed with the less depressive atmosphere, then you'll love this place.  However, if you can actually focus on the food, you'll be less than impressed.  Thinking back to my visit last year to a smaller Mandarin, the food was better there.  Less variety, but BETTER tasting.

Question:  What's the big deal with Crab Legs, anyway??  Too little 'meat' for soo much effort!"}
{"text":"Went there for my mom's birthday on a Saturday. We made reservations for 5:30; came in at 5:15 and we were immediately taken to our table. It wasn't that busy - yet. 

The food here has improved quite a bit, I first came to Wok of Fame during it's soft opening. I must admit, they have made a lot of changes - for the better. 

Hot food was good, I TRIED to get a little bit of everything, but there was just too much food for one person to even try a piece of each. 

The mashed potatoes were a little strange... The consistency seemed like it was the packaged mashed potato and it had this.... seafood after-taste to it. I even asked my family about what they thought, and they agreed. The sashimi was cut a little too small. I'm used to sashimi being cut in the length of a credit card. However it was HALF the size of that. I guess I shouldn't really be complaining, as it is AYCE.

On the high notes, the chicken wings were deliciously moist and not over-salted. They DO have crab legs, however they aren't pre-cut like the ones at Mandarin are. Oh yes, and my favourite, they have coconut, mango, green tea and red bean ice cream! (They had me at coconut)

As for the decor, it's nice. However I feel like it's just too much. All of the different themes mushed together. I guess they were trying to do themed areas like Mandarin (like the Fish room, Bird room and Garden Room), but it just didn't work for Wok of Fame, because they didn't have walls to divide the themed areas.

All in all, Wok of Fame has redeemed itself from the disaster it was when I first went. For those that are wondering, \"Which is better, Mandarin or Wok of Fame?\" I'd say they're both different in their own ways - I can't really choose :(


FYI:  Always call to make reservations - JUST in case."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the concept of having people to cook in front of you and this place offers that in buffet style. You can basically order whatever, from beef, chicken, fish or even shellfish. But the taste is below mediocre. Selection of food is quite small and for the amount youre paying for, I dont think its worth it. Ive been here several times usually when there's an occassion. And although someone else ended up paying for it, I never really liked the food and then I feel bad because money spent here could have been spent somewhere else. Its a place I would never suggest to someone who's planning to have their baptismal or engagement celebration here. Its just an ok place plus the piano."}
{"text":"When I first walked in, the place looked amazing. It was dimly lit with very fitting decor. Even the food bar itself was in the shape of a boat. In the centre of the place is a piano, but there was no one playing at the time. 

The selection is much smaller than other buffets like Mandarin and Spoonful. 
Taste-wise, I would recommend the live cooking section. You can choose what you want and they'll cook it right in front of you. But... That's the extent of the good food here. All the other sections offer food that's just average at best. The rice on the sushis was hard and didn't taste fresh. The pizza was cold and looked like it had been sitting out on the counter for hours. The meat tasted on par or even worse than something you'd get at a fast-food restaurant. As for dessert, while it's true that there's a large selection, it's mainly different flavours of the same dessert. Served in plastic cups, it looked and tasted cheap. Even their creme brûlée tasted awful and I had no idea that was even possible. 

Overall, the place is nice to look at and it's great that it's free on your birthday but the food itself is really just average at best."}
{"text":"Of all the buffets this my favourite.  I tell everyone because of its beautiful ambiance and live entertainment. The selection is incredible. Compared to Mandarin this is three times more variety for about the same price. Build your own stir fry dishes and watch them cook before your eyes."}
{"text":"Wow this place was a complete waste of money.

Top to bottom from apps to meals to desserts everything legit tasted like trash.

I don't usually say this but, never ever ever again will i come here."}
{"text":"Best buffet I've ever been to.  Drinks are included (non alcoholic of course) and almost everything is made to order aka fresh!!!! They even have a soft serve icecream machine.  Nothing compares!"}
{"text":"Whenever there is a holiday or a day off, I seem to find myself at Wok Of Fame, and for very good reason. I'm aware that there are other buffets that have woks and live cooking (Mongolian Grill comes to mind), but Wok Of Fame is the right blend of buffet food selection as well as live cooking that I've tried. The restaurant is very spacious so bringing large groups for parties or other events can be done easily and the reservations are done quickly.

 If you come here, I'd highly recommend coming during dinner hours. Lunch is decent but you will get a lot more value for your money by going for dinner, especially for the live cooking items as you can get salmon, shrimp, steak and more during dinner. The buffet items are about what you'd expect from other buffets, although the dessert part is lacking in comparison. If you're mainly interested in the wok and live cooking aspect and not necessarily the buffet items, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I would give it a 3 but +1 for a generous birthday policy.  You don't see it that kind of policy out there anymore where bday person is free with any party size.

For a buffet its not bad.  The setting is decent.  Drinks were included. My favorite ice cream didn't run out.  Went here for lunch.

Avoid: steak, tough as nails, sushi, wouldn't call it that really, steak...it was that hard
Whats good: fish...hard to screw up basa fillets, the make your own stir fry, super fresh because of high turnover, green tea/mango ice cream
Hidden Gem: beef brisket, had a good amount of tendon attached to it, made it feel like i was having ox tail"}
{"text":"OMG how I missed writing ... but besides the point, I have to say I absolutely love wok of fame. I've been here multiple time before and I think it's totally worth the price you pay!!! 

There is lots of variety and the flavour and quality of the food is great. 

my favourite would have to be the steak that they cook in front of you, there might be a wait but it's definitely worth it. 

the atmosphere is pretty amazing, it's got some classical banquet hall feel but it's a buffet restaurant. something different from your average Chinese buffet. 

If your in the area and ur hungry stop by the wok of fame, they don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Loved it. Surprisingly one of the biggest buffet i have seen in GTA (have tried almost all A-league buffets. It reminded me of the buffet i had while staying at Bellagio, Las Vegas. Food is quite good. I wish they had more choice in sushi. Its neither a cheap buffet nor i will put it in the list of expensive ones. However, if you are feeling hungry and have a good taste buds, this is definitely a spot to hit on."}
{"text":"The food is good here.  Sushi selections are better than other AYE places.  The fresh selections to choose from to have cooked for you is a treat.  Cindy the server is amazing and I love when I am seated in her section.  
Dinner selections are the best.  Was not impressed with their lunch the 1 time I went."}
{"text":"Wok of Fame has always been the go to place for a family celebration. Really enjoy the onsite cooking with the wok as well as the unlimited drinks. For an AYCE place, wok delivers a variety of food from freshly cooked food in the wok, to live cooking of prawns, musscles, salmon n steak, to a delicious array of desserts. On your birthday you eat for free by showing your passport. Staff is friendly, place is big n clean. Will continue to go to Wok of Fame!"}
{"text":"I never liked Chinese buffets and a visit to Wok of Fame just further confirms it. 

It's your typical buffet with a lot of fried foods, a handful of stir fry dishes that is not very inspiring nor tasty.  There is a sushi bar but it serves up very limited variety of sashimi and maki rolls. They do have a wok station where you can grab your own ingredients and choose your own sauce which I thought it was kind of different however, a taste of my pai thai left my taste bud very disappointed.  

I don't think I will be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time trying this as it was a birthday celebration. Great price with non alcoholic drinks. I wonder if this was another buffet restaurant before? The food was great as there was great selection of food. I didn't try the sushi but I saw they have even sashimi as well. The grilled foods were great as well. The atmosphere was more lively then other buffet restaurant.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND reserving tables in advance. Great for parties and birthdays. Show your ID on your bday and your meal is free"}
{"text":"Quality has gone down..
Besides the live cooking stations.. Everything else is pretty stale.. Even the Chinese food from the fried rice to general tao chicken is stale. It's like been frozen than microwave and put back out.. Thumbs down to this place"}
{"text":"This is one of the better serviced buffets in the GTA.  They have plenty of serving staff that's constantly making sure the tables are clear and that the food is always stocked up during busy times.  The food is average, nothing to complain about and they have a good variety of sushi and Chinese food.  There's a grilling station and something you don't see too often - a \"hotpot\" station where you load up you plate and they boil all the food for you personally.  

It's a great place for a get together where everyone gets to pick what they want and it's very spacious - always seems to have enough room for seating - I hear it used to be a Home Outfitters location before it got converted to Wok of Fame."}
{"text":"The salad bar was plentiful. The live cooking station was cool. You pick your raw meat, ur noodles, and ur veggies, then theyll boil it and fry it up. I didnt see pork at this place though which is nice for people who don't eat it.

Sooo many dessert options from cakes, cookies to ice cream and pastries. Pretty awesome.

$23.99 for dinner. $13.99 for lunch. Free dinner on your birthday."}
{"text":"After driving pass Wok of Fame for years, I figured it was time to give this place a try. 

It is super spacious and their decor is incredibly beautiful! There were plenty of guests who actually dressed up fancy to come eat here... I guess I didn't get the memo! Haha 

They're known for the live cooking option - you get to pick what raw meat and veggies you want and bring it over to the wok section where you can choose your sauce and they'll cook it in front of you! The idea is cool, but there's only one person cooking it so the line up is very long and time consuming ... maybe they have more people cooking it during weekends? Anyway, I can clearly tell the guy did not enjoy his job... A lot of people don't like their jobs either but they still manage to fake a smile :) 

Quality wise the food is average, just like any other Chinese restaurant but I don't think it's that good of a selection ... I'm a picky eater though so maybe that's why none of the food really stood out to me. One thing I really liked though was that they had spicy mayo and seaweed salad in their sushi section!

I really like the drinks were self-serve AND included in the price! They had a few pop fountains and fridges full of water bottles! They even had one fridge turned off for room temperature water which is a really nice touch!

With drinks being self-serve, there really isn't any need for a server unless you wanted to order alcohol, tea or coffee instead and to clear up your table. It did get annoying because our plates would either be cleared too slow or it'd be cleared really fast but they'd take my drink with them so I had to constantly walk back to the buffet area and get a new drink.... 

I probably wouldn't ever initiate going back here myself, but if there was a large party or family and friends wanted to go here then I'll return."}
{"text":"My work came here for a goodbye dinner because our company purchased these wok of fame coupons that were soon expiring. We told them upon sitting down that we had coupons and they said it was fine. At the end of dinner they said they were only taking two and refused the rest. The said it was stated in the coupon but we reminded them that we informed them of the coupons before we sat and they said it was ok. After 40 minutes of going back and fourth and the manager refusing to come to our table they said FINE this time but never again. The funniest part was how upset and rude the waiter was.. I was planning on leaving a tip but I thought a yelp review would be better. Oh and they also forgot my drink order. They are lucky it's all you can eat so the service isn't really taken into consideration but they would get a zero for their customer service skills."}
{"text":"I came here for the weekend for my dad's birthday because he wanted to claim his free meal lol. We went early so there wasn't much of a line up. Live cooking stations are neat. You get to pick your grub and they'll cook it for you. Downfall is you have to wait for your food. And honestly, it can be a real pain. Sure the food is freshly cooked but I had to wait a good ten minutes before I can get some shrimp and mussels. The shrimp wasn't even fresh so that was a waste of time. Also, there was no dim sum selection when we went. 

Sushi for a buffet was meh but they should put a little more care in sashimi slicing. Those cube and odd shaped pieces just looked unappealing. I like the edemame though. Very fresh and not overdone or salted like you get at AYCE sushi places. 

Lots of desserts. Soft serve is a really popular choice. Chocolate fountains were so watered down though that the chocolate left a thin translucent glaze on the strawberries so I was disappointed in that. Should have expected that.

One perk is the refreshments were included. Obviously you have to pay for alcohol but free water bottles, and fountain drinks. Makes the job easier for the servers. It wasn't that busy but I still had to approach a trio of hardly working servers just to ask for the bill. That was a bit annoying.

Live piano playing was nice. For the price, ($29.99 dinner on weekends) I don't think I'll be returning. Too many cons and not enough pros to have me coming back."}
{"text":"We went during a time there was no line and got a table right away.
The waiters there are extremely attentive, every time a plate was finished, there was someone to pick it up already.
The live cooking was an interesting station as you could choose whatever items you wanted in your dish along with the sauce you wanted.
I thought that there was a smaller than expected variety for the sushi station but it did have more to pick from compared to Mandarin.
I did like some of the selections of the buffet, especially the noodles.
Overall, I did like it and would maybe come back, only during special occasions!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday night. First time here. Pretty good as far as buffets go. Mostly Asian food, but some good seafood and one hell of a dessert area. Salads and seafood are fresh and the \"create your own stir fry\" is a cool way to customize your own meal. Unlike Mandarin, fountain drinks and bottle juice is included in the meal price. Sushi is average; nothing extraordinary. The Dessert area is impressive. Great slices of cake, soft serve ice cream, chocolate fountain and even a waffle station. The restaurant, including the washrooms are clean and service is good. I'd definitely make the effort to come here instead of Mandarin. Adults expect to pay $28pp on weekends. Only thing stopping me from giving a 5th star is the sushi. If I could give 4.5 stars, I would."}
{"text":"Good alternative to Mandarin, but not my first choice.  Food quality is okay, but selection isn't the greatest.  They do have the option to make your own stir fry which is great.  Their hot dishes are good, not great. 

One really great perk to be honest - their drink options! Self serve, and its great.

I'd say yes - it's worth the value.  I'd definitely prefer/recommend going to the Mandarin but again - it's a great alternative and a tad cheaper than the Mandarin. 

FYI - don't go right at the start of dinner!!! I had to wait over 10 minutes in a line just to reach get to one of the hot counters - it was madness."}
{"text":"This place is okay. For a large all you can eat buffet its pretty well stocked and run...but the food isn't anything special. It sort of tastes like your favourite shitty Chinese food locations all got together and teamed up in one location. Decent service at best
Overall: Food= 3/5 Atmosphere= 3/5 Service= 3/5
oh and by the way...come hungry! At $30/person this isn't a cheap buffet. Get your moneys worth"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Wok Of Fame and I was surprised at how busy it was on Sunday right after opening. The claim to fame is the restaurant's live cooking and teppanyaki station. You can choose your own vegetables and meat and then a chef will cook it for you. You can also choose from a variety of sauces. The stir fry was okay, but honestly nothing special. I tried to sirloin steak from the teppanyaki area and I found it overcooked, dry and bland. The sushi was okay, but the rest of the food was not very good. The Chinese noodles were made fettuccine pasta and the eggplant in the Chinese eggplant dish were bitter. 

Although the restaurant is pretty big, the selection is not that great and the quality of the food is poor. Also, the food is spread out and the arrangement of the food doesn't make much sense. I definitely won't be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"This Chinese/Japanese Buffet is wonderful, VERY fancy and food (for the most part -- fish balls are as firm as rubber and tilapia was very bland even with sauces) was great. However, the service did take a while (for bill and to bring cake (side note, the bday cake they bring is the size of your palm and is from the buffet)). Drink service is good, all drinks except for alcohol and coffee/tea are free. Overall, I definitely would go again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and each time I go I always end up feeling disappointed. I would definitely recommend going during the weekends rather than the weekdays. During the weekdays there's barely any good food!!"}
{"text":"When I saw this place had live cooking stations I had to give it a try! I took my dad here as an early Father's Day dinner on a Thursday night. The cost was $22 a person, includes drinks, which was well worth it.

I'll start with the reason I didn't give this place five stars. The hot table section did not have very many options. This seemed to be a less popular side of the buffet causing the food to sit and not be as fresh. In comparison to Mandarin, the selection is limited.

HOWEVER.. This place is way better then the Mandarin! Let me tell you why.
- fresh sushi that is surprisingly tasty  
- extensive dessert section (the creme brûlée is delicious!)
- great salad bar 
- stir fry stations 

The stir fry stations are something I have not seen at a buffet before and what makes Wok of Fame worth a visit. They have a raw food bar that has chicken, beef, squid, crab & shrimp along with a great selection of vegetables. Pick one of many sauces and have it cooked in front of you.
On the other side of the station they had two gentlemen grilling up steak, tilapia, salmon and shrimp.

Wok of Fame deserves 4.5 stars as a great self serve buffet."}
{"text":"A decent buffet that was once one of my favourites. I've been here three times for lunch and the last visit was subpar due to sections of the buffet not having food.  Overall, the service is good as the servers are very friendly.  It is a bit pricey for the limited food you get for lunch but hey, it's a pretty restaurant and has nice decor & finishings. I would recommend going once to see how you like it; maybe you'll get a different experience!

This buffet has live cooking stations which include salmon, steak, pad Thai, mussels, shrimp & chicken.  Also, give this place a try on your birthday; it's free which is amazing!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a birthday, since they offer a free meal on the day of your birthday with any party size. The interior was enormous. It's much bigger than most AYCE Chinese/Japanese restaurants in the Markham/Richmond Hill area.

The food was decent. I think the best part of the experience was the teppanyaki-style stations at the center. They perfectly cooked salmon fillets. We also tried the shrimp, but found it a little too difficult to peel off the shell. We also enjoyed the sushi. Kudos to Wok of Fame for storing bottles of low-sodium soy sauce at the table.

We also enjoyed the plethora of dessert choices. I tried a number of the dessert selections, including the red bean ice cream and the apple pie. I wanted to try the soft-serve ice cream but was too stuffed at the end of dinner.

All in all, a decent restaurant. Though I think the AYCE options in the Markham/Richmond Hill area have better selection for the price. I wouldn't mind coming to Wok of Fame for the birthday deal, but would think twice about coming here at full price."}
{"text":"Of the many food options, I gravitated towards the sushi, dim sum, soups, desserts, and of course the custom woks! The onion rings were a surprising star of the show. 

All of the food I had was quite fresh, but 1/3 of our party had upset stomach afterwards so maybe avoid platters that look like they have been out for too long.

All in all, four assorted plates made for a very satisfying lunch :)"}
{"text":"Disappointing. The buffet is mediocre, nothing special. The live cooking was a good draw but everything was very under seasoned. The stirfry cooking was also not good tasting.as for the rest of the food, just meh. 

Service is efficient, good clearing of plates. Unlimited drinks and bottled water. Buy due to the taste more like lack of taste, Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Prices have increased since the last time my family and I visited. On weekends it is now $29.99 per person! Make sure you come hungry to eat because $30/person is quite high.

We arrived around 6 pm on a Saturday and it was quite busy. However, we were seated right away without any reservations. The service was decent throughout our stay. They came by every so often to take away our dishes and to provide us with more napkins. There was also a live pianist playing some nice background music for the restaurant as well. This is something you don't see at any other buffets.

Food items that I liked were: the tilapia, hot crab legs, onion rings, and the custom stir fry. What they were lacking was the salmon sashimi. There were tons of butterfish and maybe four pieces of salmon by the time I wanted some.

The price is quite high but I do think it's better than Mandarin."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I have always enjoyed the buffet. There are lots of options that cater to a variety of tastes e.g. the sushi bar, the stir fry area, salad bar, dessert table, etc. I had some of the sushi and sashimi and it was pretty tasty. Everything I had from the roast beef to the breaded shrimp was delicious and satisfied my ayce craving. Unfortunately the soft serve ice cream machine wasn't working too well when I was there which made me a little sad but the other desserts made up for it."}
