{"text":"Lately my husband and I have been frequenting this wonderful restaurant quite a lot over the past few months so I feel it necessary to write a quick review on them. This is a fantastic place for sushi and Japanese food, the ambience is beautiful, always playing relaxing music and the black decor and sparkly crystals that hang from the roof really give the place a classy modern feel. The restaurant is always clean and well taken care of. The food is very affordable and one of the cheaper places in Calgary for sushi we have found. The staff are always very friendly, attentive and helpful. I would say that we have been to this restaurant for both take out and to eat in, roughly a dozen times or more and every time the food is made to order and very tasty and seafood dishes are always fresh. There is a reason we keep going back again and again, if you are a fan of Japanese cuisine then I would definitely try Shigatsu. I give them 5 stars because they are consistently good and have never let us down with service, ambience or most importantly food quality."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite for us. They have some great fusion dishes and the sushi quality is amazing, especially for the price. I can't say enough good things about this place. 

If you are interested in higher quality sushi and trying new rolls this place is great - and less pricey that comparables like Globe Fish. It's really a great middle ground between cheaper places and really fancy but expensive places."}
{"text":"So...yelp removed my original post from here because they thought I just copied and pasted someone's review, which happen to be my OWN review on that site...

Thanks yelp!  So here it is again!

Food Rating: 4.5/10
Ambience: 6/10
Service: 8/10

Went on a Sunday night, it was quite quiet. The interior of the restaurant changed a lot compared to Gunkan.

They gave us a complimentary appetizer, which tasted similar to a beef tataki. I really liked the sauce, the meat was rather rough. Couldn't really make out with it is.

Decided to try the beef tataki and the agedashi tofu. The beef tataki sauce tasted different from complimentary one, it's a little spicy. I preferred the complimentary one more though. The tofu was a little soggy and soft, it wasn't really crispy nor was it hot.

Most of the nigiri were ok, nothing special. But the red tuna had a hint of sourness to it. The rolls are loosely wrapped and it reminds me of a smaller version of Izumi Sushi Yokozuna.

We tried a trio of banana flavored dessert. Banana Panna Cotta, banana cheesecake, and banana tiramisu. On the side, it came with banana bread and banana rice krispies. I liked it because it was quite distinctive and it wasn't too heavy. The Banana Panna Cotta was my favorite.

Overall, there were nothing memorable and nothing special. There are other restaurants that I would prefer over Shigatsu.
It would have been more satisfying going to Ajisai or even Sushi Boat!"}
{"text":"Good service decent food with pretty good value! We just moved into the neighbourhood and tried this restaurant for lunch and tonight for dinner! I have to say we were pleasantly surprised at how good it was! We asked for an item which wasn't on their menu and they obliged us by making it! Very close to our new house so we will go back and add this restaurant to our list of go to spots!"}
{"text":"So dissappointing Shigatsu. Recommended by our airBNB host, and high ratings on Yelp we decided to curb our sushi cravings here. 

Spicy tuna taco - fried wonton shell - amazing 

Okonomiyaki - cabbage with mozza and fish flakes 

Volcano roll - not sure if thie is the calgary version but we thought we should try it anyway. Pork cutlet, kimchi and slice of mozza on top - dry rice, and pork, weird with the mozza 

Kamikaze roll - so called giant roll was not so giant. Salmon, avocado, spicy mayo tempura. It seemed like they used half a piece of salmon sashimi in the entire roll, a 2 inch sliver of avocado. The rest was rice and tempura batter."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area, but not quite up there with say, Sushi Bar Zipang in Bridgeland. Usually quiet, and so the staff is eager to help!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi and ambience... Extremely reasonable prices. Will go again and again."}
{"text":"Having visited its predecessor, we were curious as to what changes Shigatsu had brought to Mount Pleasant. Like the decor that was full of shiny metallics and crystals, the food and service here was shiny, sparkly... and ever so prompt! Having just entered the premises before a rush of several small groups after us, there was only one other table occupied when we arrived. Unlike some restaurants who may choose to seat everyone in one section first, our server placed us in a booth several tables away... which as great in terms of having one's own space for dinner enjoyment and conversation. Shortly after we were seated, complimentary tuna tataki appetizers whetted our appetites to taste more of what Shigatsu had to offer. We opted to pick one item to share from most of the menu sections, plus some of the sushi off the a la carte list. We were definitely not disappointed! From our appetizer of age-dashi tofu, the salmon sashimi platter, the kaisou salad, the assorted tempura, and the Alaska and Ocean rolls... each dish was beautifully plated and tasted even better than it looked! The surprise of a complimentary dessert sampler made us wish we had the time and room to order a full dessert! So glad to see Shigatsu in Calgary!"}
{"text":"As most reviews have already pointed out, the decor is very nice and this place would appear to be a great place for a group to have a small party or a late night get together. If given the option, I actually would rate it a 3.5.

I went for lunch, having the $12.95 Sushi Combo which came with a green tea ($1), miso soup, 3 piece California Roll, 3 piece cucumber roll, 3 piece spicy salmon roll, 4 pieces of chef's choice nigiri (hamachi, salmon, tuna, ebi), a tuna hand roll, and then a $5.50 6 piece spicy tuna roll. Suffice to say, I was hungry. The fish was very fresh and was delivered to the table within minutes (at the time, we were the only people in the restaurant).

The dishware (at least for lunch) is mostly white plates and bowls which contrasts with the mostly black decor (a picture of the inside of the restaurant showing the beads and other decor has been posted). The seating is reasonably comfortable. The ambiance allows for conversation without disturbing others or having to talk over the music.

The service was excellent. I had conversed with the owner via facebook since previously I had came by and it had been closed (which apparently, was due to an issue with the kitchen).

Other reviewers had noted that the portion size was small and over-priced but I found it to be on par with the likes of Sho Sushi Bar & Kitchen on MacLeod though Sho has what appears to be a full bar and is open later. I found the portions adequate and the price relative but of course, whom doesn't want more when the food is good and want it for a lesser price?"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this weekend. It was fantastic. The price isn't that far out of the sushi price point. The sushi and other items off there menu were so good that me and my two guests kept ordering more. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves authentic Japanese food! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi restaurant! Sleek, always clean modern interior, attentive & quick staff, and delicious, fresh food with affordable prices! Staff is also willing to accommodate for vegan customers, such as myself."}
{"text":"We used to live in Vancouver and have eaten at fantastic traditional sushi restaurants many times. This place is very good, their sushi and sashimi is very well prepared and their rolls are excellent. This is how traditional sushi tastes and feels in the mouth.  We have eaten here many times and the other sushi places in the  area do not measure up. Sometimes sushi places don't cut the fish right and it's got chewy parts difficult to chew. Not here this sushi chef is excellent! 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We were invited to tShigatsu last night by some friends of ours who just moved into the neighbourhood, we were 4 adults and 4 children.  I think I've discovered my new favourite sushi restaurant.  The menu was excellent.  We were given a little bite of fish to get our taste buds rolling before we ordered.  My friend really want to drink wine and since we didn't love the selection they had in the restaurant we were encouraged to go next door and purchase a bottle of our choice at the wine store.  We were charged $5 per person for corkage which was really reasonable.  

The decor is lovely and the staff was really kind and attentive.  We ordered a bunch of food for the kids to get them going.  They had age-dashi tofu ($6), gyoza ($7), calamari ($10), yam fries ($9), cucumber rolls ($3.5), and chicken naban ($10).  The kids gobbled it all up.  

The adults ordered assorted tempura ($11), salmon and tuna sushi ($2/piece), Tuna sashimi (spice sauce on the side) ($13), general roll ($11), dynamite roll ($6), spicy tuna roll ($5.5), and 2 goma-ae ($5).  The highlight for me was the goma-ae, I love this dish and I usually have a hard time finding it in sushi restaurants.  The sesame sauce/spinach salad was so good I'll be craving it daily until I have it again. 

They service was so good they surprised us with a desert plate, it had a deconstructed, very simple tiramisu, panna cotta pudding, and a delicate pastry (I will attach a photo).  Again this extra attention to detail was really well received and appreciated.

Overall the food and service was excellent.  The food was really well plated and presented.  If I knew before hand how much I was going to enjoy this restaurant I would have taken more photos of the food.  I fear they will be getting a lot busier as the food is so delicious."}
{"text":"It is not the tastiest sushi joint in town but at least they handle their raw fish well. The miso soup is fresh made, not out of the package. The rolls are nothing spectacular. Overall it is just OK but definitely not terrible."}
{"text":"Popped in for a snack with my sushi monster son. He said he wanted to test their dynamite roll, so test it we did. He enjoyed it so much that I had to tell him to slow down and save some for me. I'm not sure how the rest of the menu fares, but the dynamite roll got a pass from an expert (my son)."}
{"text":"I think Anne pretty much hit the nail on the head. The decor was nice, I could see potential for this spot to be a posh hang out, get drinks kind of place (if it weren't so expensive) but the food is really really disappointing. I came especially for the okonomiyaki, since it is a really hard to find item.....and we had to send it back to the kitchen. It was that bad. And they still charged us for it. The portions are ridiculously small and overly expensive. 

I think I'll spare myself and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm perplexed that this place has four stars on Yelp. We admittedly chose a slow time to visit (midday Sunday on a holiday long weekend), but we found the place to be mediocre. 

The service was friendly and the okonomiyaki we got was reasonably tasty. The several pieces of sushi that we ordered were all dry, limp, and had the slightly fishy smell and taste of old fish. I don't expect that we'll be back. :-("}
