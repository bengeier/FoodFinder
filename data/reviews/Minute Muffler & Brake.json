{"text":"I've been taking my car here since June 2015 - I found them by accident when I was looking for a quick place to get a pre purchase inspection done.  I have been beyond impressed every time I've gone here - they are friendly and welcoming, they don't talk down to me, and they are very fair with their prices, sometimes not even charging me for small jobs.  I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"I needed an insurance inspection completed on an older vehicle and used This minute muffler and brake.  I found their service to be very efficient.  The lady at the desk (Robin) was very professional.  Their mechanic was excellent at communicating the work that needed to be completed.  Also, the work required for this vehiocle to pass was completed quickly so I wasn't without a vehicle for more than half a day.  The price was also fair and its worth mentioning that the shop area was organized and clean.  I'm impressed with the service I received at this minute muffler and would gladly come back in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Fast and efficient with amazingly fair prices. I will come here from now on for any work needed on my vehicle."}
