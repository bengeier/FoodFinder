{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with the sushi rolls , fresh salmon and dragon roll were great so was the tempura appetizer was a great deal, my daughter had a side of fried noodles with chicken she loved it! I have one complain about the green tea, it was so weak and came from a tea bag, expected more at a Japanese place. The sesame chicken is not your average it's tonkatsu chicken with the sauce on the side, I happened to like it, not so great the tonkatsu sandwich my hubby was dissapointed with it. The ginger salad dressing was way to strong like pure ginger blended but the sesame dressing was delicious!! They really need to get bigger tablecloths or none at all, they were wrinkled and didn't cover the whole table, uncomfortable too. The service was ok , will love to see the host smile at least once :) overall we liked the sushi and will probably do to go next time instead on eating in !"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night. Asked for dry sake got the sweetest one they had after waiter said it was very dry. Purchased 2 rolls and some Nigiri and sash. 1 roll was great the other looked like they stuffed it with pre-chewed fish from previous patrons and tasted as such. On my third piece giving it the college try I found a piece of bone an inch and a half long. At this point I just stopped eating and left. My first visit with my wife was sub par and this followed. I have had sushi in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and all over the US..trust me this is bad. How it receives good reviews is amazing. But perhaps this is why Applebee's gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"It would be nice if these people new how to take a takeout order over the phone, which is a huge part of their business. The girl who helped me sounded bored and confused. South Charlotte needs a descent sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"No need to give this place multiple attempts we have. Let me save you the time. You are welcomed when you walk into the door by an instant smell of bleach, you feel like your in a box, no ambiance decor, music or views. The shades stay closed even at night. The walls are filthy and the tables are sticky at lunch. At least at dinner service they put table clothes to cover. Service is mediocre at best as new servers are trying to do their best, being they are all new as turn over is high. We tried many times to like this place but my husband stated tonight \"never again \". I want to pay for the experience of eating out and the local sandwich place has this place beat hands down. No reason to pay the high price of sushi for this experience. It's a shame too. They have prime location. They could ROCK this place if they tried"}
{"text":"The wait staff is generally pretty good, and so is the food. The price is a little high, but it is reasonable. My issue is with the To Go situation. As we recently had a child and are not currently apt to dine-in, we have been utilizing takeout from the various restaurants within our area. We attempted 18 tonight. As soon as I walked in, I greeted the hostess and payed for my food. It was not ready at the time so I sat down and waited. I watched as a woman repeatedly brought food out from the kitchen and gave it to the hostess. I felt assured that had it been my food, the young girl would have notified me. I peered over every now and again and watched as the she held her iPhone in plain sight--the distinct pink case making it stick out even more--typing, texting, whatever. This would have been of no concern had I not been sitting there for twenty minutes when I had finally had enough and went up there and looked at three bags sitting behind her, and said, \"One of those wouldn't happen to be mine?\" \"Oh, yea, here you go.\" My mistake for tipping before I got my food I suppose. 

My advice for 18: stop hiring hostesses based on how cute they are--and maybe don't let them play on their phones when they are supposed to be helping customers."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the bad reviews. This is one of the best sushi places in town. The food is also affordable and the portions are large. Of you are looking for great Asian food for a great price then you have to try 18 Asian."}
{"text":"Had to take it down a notch, as sushi remains good, but last time, had a really bad server.  Wanting to join in on our conversations, pushing signature rolls (twice!) after we told him we preferred other ways to order our sushi, had to ask for soy sauce, chopsticks, plates, didn't clear between orders, another server had to clear for him when we finished, and actually saw him sit down with customers at another table!  I could go on with negatives about him, but enough, already!

Too bad a server impacts the whole dining experience so badly."}
{"text":"The Sushi Review:
18 Asian and Sushi Bar

The location of this relatively new sushi spot is ideal for those living in or around South Charlotte. Located at 9935 Rea Rd. near the Blakeney area, it is in the perfect place for an early dinner or an after-shopping unwind. The d√©cor is very attractive and the staff is friendly. My divochka and I sat at the bar because it looked very inviting and cozy in a display of contemporary style. It is also typically the best way to get faster service for 1 to 3 people and ask any questions you may think of to get an immediate answer.

We ordered several different varieties of Maki rolls, including the infamous \"Soundboy Roll\" (ask for the Philly roll - tempura) and they were all above average. The tempura was done in the crispy-crumble style as opposed to the overly-rich batter fried style, which is healthier I'm sure. The negative reviews that I read about their sushi prior to my visit were about the rice being \"mushy\". These were from people who were probably used to dried-out rolls or pieces with undercooked rice. However, that is how some people actually enjoy their sushi and I say to each his/her own. Much of the material we (especially as writers) share about our experiences is subjective. Opinions will of course vary from one individual to the next, so it's best to identify with the author as much as possible.

The beer selection was good and the house Sake was great - when it was hot, so don't fool around and let it cool off too much. The big can of Sapporo can split 2 ways and chases the Sake with ease. My recommendations are the \"Green Monster Roll\" if you are an avocado fan, or play it safe with the spider roll and the shrimp tempura. Overall the sushi was good and the atmosphere was very inviting. The ambient music was not bad, but a great soundtrack could really turn this spot into a \"must try\". The prices are slightly above average compared to some other places in the area but that is a reflection of the area itself. Compared to Uptown, Midtown or SouthPark however, the prices are very reasonable. Overall I recommend it."}
{"text":"Dined here about a month ago.  Sushi decent but entire evening ruined by a server who thought he was part of our family, trying to join in our private conversations, pushing signature rolls more than once, forgetting chopsticks AND plates, neglecting to clear.  Even saw him sitting DOWN with another table.
We had a coupon to apply, which server made note of , then returned later with manager to tell us it had been used previously.  We used another lesser one, but checked website next day only to find they were BOTH validated the night before.  TOTAL dishonesty.

So obviously not a repeat here AND after calling next day to talk to manager, complained, with nothing of any value offered.  (Oh, so sorry)

Enough said"}
{"text":"Staff is pretty good, nice decor. Food is either really good or really bad.  Sushi is average, not sure why on the spicy tuna roll, instead of having a solid piece of tuna, they mush it up, doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"Food is so so good. Service is not. The service is actually awful. It's like they hire servers With zero experience and don't train them. Here's an apron, go serve people, good luck."}
{"text":"Food was decent... Service was horrendous! The waiter literally never came by. The manager finally took our order just mins before we were going to walk out. When the food finally came, it was actually pretty good. Had a few different rolls and the miso soup was great. When time to pay the check, I realized I hadn't received it yet. So I sat... And sat... And sat... Until some other waiter came over. I asked him to get my check....  20 mins later the guy finally brought it. It was by far the worst service I've ever had at any restaurant!  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This one is two stars, but barely.
I've tried it a few times, and twice now the Salmon roe (Ikura) was dried out, and mushy, so I didn't even eat it.  

(The Ikura can say a lot about a place.. it should be wet and firm, so they explode in your mouth when you apply pressure with your teeth.  If they are sticky, deflated, over-salted and mushy, they are no good, and the pace probably isn't either.) 

I sat at the bar a couple times, and the bartender walked around staring into space instead of picking up my filled-out sushi sheet, or bringing my check.  He never once asked how the food was, and I had to flag down the sushi chef at the other end of the bar to get any service.

The seaweed wrap around the rolls was also tough/chewy, so eating them was not pleasant.  

Their warm dishes aren't bad, but I won't go for the sushi or ever sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Really great fish. nice selection of roles.  Great service and wonderful atmosphere. I would say that this is the best sushi restaurant in south charlotte."}
{"text":"Very disaointing customer service and food.  Having eating there several times we ordered sushi and an order of sesame chicken with broccoli.  the sushi was ok but some of the pieces were so large they were hard to eat.   the chicken was so overcooked and tough we couldn't eat it.  The waiter showed it to the manager who said there was nothing they could do.  We couldn't eat it and they refused to take it off the bill.  they lost a good customer for $7.95.  I was shocked with their attitude.  the plate was nearly full, my wife and I had both tried to eat one piece of chicken and spit it out but they said because we had tried it we had to pay.   WILL NEVER GO BACK!  plenty of other choices."}
{"text":"Atmosphere- pretty, cozy, small. I like it.

Food- Lemon twist sushi roll was really good! Calamari appetizer was good as well. Yazzy Snazzy sushi (daily special roll) was good but not my favorite. Hawaiian roll- okay.

Service- if you're coming super hungry be ready to be hangry. I'm glad I wasn't super hungry cuz everything took a while! Even getting our water look unusually long. It looked like there was one waitress for a strangely busy Sunday evening. 

Random tip- I liked how they let us slide with a special request. My mom likes sushi that is fried on the outside and still warm. And they said they could do that to one of the regular rolls. Omg that made it so yummy."}
{"text":"Sushi here is average, no better than what you can get from the cooler at harris teeter. Overpriced drinks are even more over priced and service is sub par"}
{"text":"Arguably the best sushi in S CLT. The tempura appetizer is awesome if you're in the mood to splurge. Saki menu is nice. Treasure Pot is a \"not too heavy\" perfect portion. Only thing I wish is they had more rotating sushi specials and specialty drinks to liven up the bar."}
{"text":"Flavors make the 3 star.  Tasty rolls. 
Service and attitudes have always always been crappy.  Weird closing hours too.  Like do your parents make you go to bed man?   Treat us like we keep the doors open: because guess what- we do."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and the sushi was good... The only complaint was that the sushi rolls were to thick and hard to enjoy...."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, friendly staff and relaxing dining experience. I've been coming here for a year now and the quality has been consistently satisfactory. The sushi chef is fun and personable. The Blakney roll is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Its rare that I go to a sushi restaurant and NOT finish at least ONE of the rolls that I ordered.   I was not a fan.  Everything had some strange spice in it that made the taste a bit off-putting.  Including the ginger dressing on the salad - very very odd and not at all what I was expecting/wanting.

The gyoza was probably the best thing we ordered.  Salads were strange with the neon orange dressing.  3 sushi rolls (Sweet 18, Charlie Roll, Spicy Lover) were just mediocre at best with odd sauces, they were falling apart, etc.  Not impressed.  

Not to mention the service (on the restaurant side) was sub-par.  When taking our order, the guy grabbed the sushi paper out of my husbands hand and ran away.  Didn't even look at it - usually they'll look it over to make sure they see everything -   Nope - snatched it out of his hand and took off!  We had to ask for napkins, had to ask for plates, had to ask for  silverware/chopsticks, had to ask for refills of iced tea after our glasses sat empty at the edge of the table for 10 minutes, had to ask for sweetener for said tea and he handed us 2 packets at a time.  

I'd come back for drinks at the bar but otherwise - I'll get my sushi somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hawaiian Sunset is so yummy! Standard miso soup but a large portion! Yakisoba was very tasty and again a generous portion. Prices were fair."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place is still in business. Service is horribly slow and inattentive. Food is really just okay (but I do like the basil beef and their sushi is decent). Get your act together...that's prime restaurant space!"}
{"text":"The sushi and the service is great. The sushi is amazing and tastes very fresh. I've noticed a lot of reviews complaining about the service but I had no problems. I was there on a busy Friday night and I still got my take out very fast and the hostess was very polite and friendly. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at a \"restaurant\" started off with a hostess that had a hard time understanding the number 3... then a cocky server/bartender that was rude obnoxious and flat out does not belong in customer service. After being there for 10 mins ordered drinks and about to order the rest of meal.. the waiter informs us of them closing. He got attitude saying it was not his job to tell us. Then demanded that we pay for the drinks I a very unpleasant way. DO NOT GO TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT. To many places around to waste time or money there."}
{"text":"So I have a gluten allergy, and getting sushi can be tough since places usually hide tempura flakes in sushi. Being aware of this, I called in and ordered 2 orders of spicy tuna rolls. I specifically told her \"no tempura flakes, I have a gluten allergy,\" to which she replied \"no problem! They are gluten free\". Perfect. I also ordered fried rice (gluten free obviously).

When I picked up the order, I checked the ticket and it said \"gluten allergy\" on the ticket. Great. Right? So I take the food home, and start eating. I immediately notice an unfamiliar crunch in the sushi, and lo and behold, tempura flakes. 

I called them and let them know they essentially just poisoned me. They apologized and told me to come back and they would make me a new order. So I go back, they are very nice about it. She asked if I wanted an 'exchange' or a 'credit'. Confused, I said credit. Then the manager came out, and was mad at me because I didn't bring the old order back to \"return it\". Why would I return food?!! I explained to her that I had eaten a piece, noticed they screwed up my order, and immediately called them. She gave me some SERIOUS attitude about that, and YELLED AT ME, telling me that this is my fault, and they always put tempura flakes in the spicy tuna rolls. WHICH IS WHY I SAID TO LEAVE THEM OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE!! 

I don't know who she thinks she is for yelling at the customer, but if I end up in the emergency room, she's sure as hell getting my medical bill.

All in all, DONT TRUST THIS PLACE IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY... Especially the manager. The sushi was good (once they fixed it). But I don't think I can trust this place again."}
{"text":"My husband and I live nearby and were craving sushi, but wanted to try something in the area so we came here before caching a movie at StoneCrest. We grabbed the last two seats at the bar and waited...and waited before one of the many passing waitstaff noticed us. We placed drink and app orders and those arrived within a reasonable time frame. We had to ask for napkins twice and they, and the plates, didn't arrive until we were finished with our edamame. Our waiter didn't check on us again until we were almost finished with our sushi course, at which time I finally asked him to remove the half empty styrofoam cup that had been sitting next to us the entire time. When he came to clear our plates, he made a snide comment about \"making sure nothing was left behind for the next guest.\" Rude! In addition to the poor service, the sushi was simply ok, and platters of sushi sat out at the bar for lengthy periods of time before being served. Next time, we'll make the trek to South Park and go to Cowfish"}
{"text":"This place is really good we got a ton of different sushi rolls and they were all delicious.  We mostly had the traditional spicy tuna, etc. rolls but we ordered oen specialty and it was pretty good - I forget the name of it though.  The ambiance inside is really nice - it reminds me of a sushi place I used to go to in Manhattan.  I like the way the sushi bar is set up in the middle of the restaurant.  The dessert was pretty bad, so I would pass on that next time.  But overall really good!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service for take out! They have one phone line and the hostess has to take orders on the phone,seat patrons and fetch and ring up take out orders. I have gotten voicemail so many times when calling and had the hostess just hang up several times and not take your order. After tonight I'm done with this place it's not worth the aggravation and the owners obviously don't care since this problem has existed for years!"}
{"text":"If you would like leave hungry and have the manager say \" that's the way it goes\" please dine here. The roles are incredibly tiny and management could care less about pleasing the customer"}
{"text":"I honestly probably only go to this place for sushi because it's near my home. The sushi is just okay. However, the service is HORRIBLE. I never eat in anymore because I'm always waiting forever to place my drink order and then waiting again to place my food order. There is one particular waitress that is especially bad. If you're getting 18 Asian, get your food to go."}
{"text":"I think I found my new favorite Sushi Bar in South Charlotte. I randomly went in for lunch one day and the freshness of the sushi was amazing. Every dish I ordered was beautifully & artistically presented. Atmosphere is hip and fun. Service was good. The sushi chefs are extremely friendly and kind. I've been back multiple times since my first visit. A must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The sushi is very fresh. My favorite is the baked roll, tsunami, and the Yazzy snazzy. All so good.."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Blakeney. You'll see many middle aged people sitting at their bar drinking wine. Which is a common Blakeney thing. 

As for the food, I'm almost about to say it's terrible. They couldn't make chicken terriaki. They gave me grilled chicken with the sauce on the side. I asked what is this? They said this is how we do it. Needless to say I'll never be back.

Also to mention the front girl ( Asian ) is rude. She should be fired but I have a feeling she may be a part owner."}
{"text":"On our first visit to 18 Asian and Sushi Bar, we felt a little bit overdressed upon arrival in polo shirts and jeans.  I didn't realize it was a T-shirt-and-shorts kind of place.  I guess because people are out casually shopping in the nearby plazas and just stop by afterwards.  No worries, but it didn't really feel like a \"night out\" because of that.  

We started with a couple of small cheap sushi rolls as appetizers.  They were yummy and good-sized for the price.  The shrimp tempura roll had a lot of flavor.  

I opted for the Spicy Stir-Fried Scallops as my entree.  It was generously portioned and tasted very good.  Spicy, though?  Not so much.  It could have used a lot more kick to actually deem it \"spicy.\"  I appreciated the option of scallops as a meat instead of the usual beef, chicken, pork, or shrimp.  Dinner prices are much higher than their lunch prices and, because it's SO casual inside (the patrons, not the decor/atmosphere), I felt like I overpaid.  

Would I go back?  Sure, for lunch if I'm shopping in the area...and in shorts and a T-shirt, thank you very much."}
{"text":"Went there with a bunch of friends for a bday celebration. The staff and owners were very accommodating to us and friendly as well as inviting. The atmosphere is upscale although the space it occupies feels a little cramped. The food itself was excellant and while a little pricey I didn't feel like it under delivered. The one area it lacked in was service. According to one of my friends who had been there before we must have caught them on a off night but non the less service was terrible. I'd recommend it to anyone who lives in the Ballantyne area but not highly to anyone who has to travel more than 20 minutes to get there. If it weren't for the service I'd go 4 stars but I'll have to stick with my 3 star rating with the quality of food and value being the saving grace of the evening."}
{"text":"I'll just start by saying 18 has very fresh fish.  

THAT SAID....WHY do they cover this gorgeous fish with gloopy mayo and sugary syrupy sauces?  Let the fish stand on it's own!  Next time we eat there I will say hold the sauces.  The tuna is fresh and tasty and the taste doesn't need to be masked with gloopy gloop and fried rice krispie bits.  There are too many fried rolls on the menu!

TRUST in your FISH, 18!  It stands on it's own!

The spicy tuna is GREAT and the wine list is VERY good.  Trefethen chardonnay...and I think there was a bottle of Gary Farrell at one point.  WELL done on your wine choices.  (I think 1/2 prices on Tues? - not sure - check with 18.) 

18 would be a top choice if they would lighten up on the sauces and fried bits...(and I'd love to see real crab instead of crab sticks) but until then, we'll head there more because it's close, but not because it's great.  

PS - husband loved the chicken & broccoli w/ brown rice + crayons for baby are a +!!"}
{"text":"The Best service ever while dining at the bar!   Mark was by far the most attentive to all details.  So very much appreciated and welcomed after a long day.  Awesome food as well. Thank you"}
{"text":"Nigiri Sushi was fresh and delish. Lots of variety on the rolls. Not bad price as cars sushi goes.  Not the most expensive but not the cheapest either. Would have give. Five stars they were very short staffed so service was slow....pleasant but slow."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday to get some sushi to go.  We decided on the deluxe sample platter for $24.95. This included 6 California Rolls and a good selection of Nigiri which included:  3 pieces of tuna (Maguro);  3 pieces of salmon (Sake); 3 pieces of snapper (Tai); and 3 pieces of eel (Unagi).  The employees were cheerful and friendly. The hostess offered us tea and/or water while we waited even though we were just getting take-out.  I liked the decor and overall feel of the place. 

When we got home and dug into the sushi, I was impressed. Sushi rice had good texture, the fish was fresh and tasted good w/just a small smear of wasabi between the rice and the fish.  Of course, the sushi was packaged alongside the standard additional dollop of wasabi and a nice pile of pickled ginger on the side.   

The pricing is in line with other area sushi places. Overall, I was pleased with the sushi and definitley will go back."}
{"text":"The wife and I have our usual sushi place that we frequent often, but we decided to try an new place on a Saturday night after a long day of driving around Charlotte for new adventures.  We got to the restaurant around 8pm and I was a little surprised by the amount of people there. The bar area was pretty much full, but there were only two other tables occupied. Anyway, the hostess greeted us and gave us the option of bar or table, but as I said above there really was not any place at the bar. Needless to say that we opted for the table. Our waiter was quick to fill water glasses and get our order going, but he was a little iffy on menu and special knowledge. He may have been a new hire, but I don't know for sure.  

Appetizer came out pretty quickly, followed by sushi. Out of everything, I really only enjoyed the nigiri, because all of the rolls that we ordered tasted off to me. The fish in the rolls was not bad, but the flavors were just not right and there may have been a level of freshness. I can't say for sure. The waiter omitted an item from our sushi order, but he quickly rectified that and overall the service was fine.

I am hesitant to return to this place, at least as a sushi option, but I may return to try some of their other food options."}
{"text":"18 had been on my sushi radar for quite some time as my wife and I would pass by on Rea Rd. I'm a HUGE sushi fan and am rarely disappointed with the fare just about anywhere. Guess we caught these guys on an off day...

We made it in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. They open at 12:30pm for lunch on Sundays, so a little later than usual for some. We were one of the first couples to make it in and there were only a few warm bodies working the kitchen. The hostess, whom decided that nonverbal communication would suffice, sat us and then stormed away. I'm not too picky with hostesses, but she didn't event greet us? A simple hello and feigned smile would be acceptable. Not the end of the world. 

Once seated, our server was quick and gave us menus, filled drinks and took our order. Started with tempura veggies and shrimp. All came out very swiftly and were tasty. The soy/hoisin sauce was delightful. 

Here's were the meal went downhill....Other couples and families started to file in and took up about 8 tables inside and outside. There was only ONE server and the manager. This is a bit unacceptable if you're opening for a 12:30pm lunch. I would understand if it were an earlier lunch, but you should expect a lunch rush....around lunchtime. Just a bit odd. 

Our drinks remained empty for a good 10 minutes and our sushi took more than 25 minutes to land on our table. I actually watched my sushi plate sit on the counter for a a good 10 minutes before our server picked it up. Once my sushi order was delivered, our server came back and asked if we needed anything...He had completely forgot to enter my wife's sushi order. Not the end of the world, but if the sushi order sheet has two sides, you just have to check both sides. It took an extra 10 minutes for my wife's sushi to arrive. All of the sushi was flavorful and well executed. Just a little put off by the service. 

I would definitely give 18 Asian another chance. These are just a few problems that can be easily fixed. As a huge sushi fan, and these guys delivered on the flavor front, I look forward to a more memorable visit in the future!"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Only reason I come.  Service is below average to horrible at times.  Most of the staff seem to not care.  Poor management of employees but very good food. (Minus the hot and sour soup! Worst recipe ever!).  If service was at least average I'd give 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great drink specials and delicious sushi!! 1/2 price select bottles of wine on Tuesdays, & you can take home what you don't finish!! Never disappointed or hungry leaving here! Must try: Craig Roll, Caterpillar Roll, Rasta Roll, & Blooming K Roll."}
{"text":"Currently I am waiting on the goods to be served.  It's taking too long for only 7 patrons. I've been here before, food average, service sub par. Tonight it's 6:30, and so far meh. No greeter, host. Bartender friendly but knew little about the weak sake selection.  Menu is vast, lots of rolls, mostly \"spicy\" mash not chunky cuts. Help wanted printout on door. Food was good, not great.  Creative rolls help, thin cut $15 Toro was no Bueno, don't skimp on the fatty at MP.  Bartender James was a very nice guy. I felt the rest of the staff just want customers to leave. I'd come again, but only when close, I'm not trekking across town for this 18. Go Yama, go Guru instead."}
{"text":"Overall place is fine but we ordered Toro. Menu said market price. Never thought to ask how much but very surprised to see it was $14 for 2 pieces. No flavor at all and definitely not worth it. Mentioned it to waiter and manager and neither one cared. Place is not as good as when it first opened."}
{"text":"Overpriced, and underwhelming, seriously, I paid $15 for moderately tasteful food and a lunch sized portion (even though it was dinner).  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"As a very local spot in South (far south) Charlotte, 18 Asian is a pretty good spot for sushi/sashimi.  I tend to be a purist when it comes to sushi or sashimi because I think some of the \"inventive\" rolls are just overkill. 

Their menu is leans more to the rolls but some are pretty good.  We tried the Spider Roll and the Spicy Lover Roll and we were both pleased with them.  I'd be willing to try this place again soon."}
{"text":"Garbage. Gave this place a 2nd chance, I should have known better. Don't waste your time or money. I ordered spicy crab salad - crab stick mixed with spicy mayo...easy right? (I explained how I wanted the crab salad - just two ingredients) I got spicy crab that they stuff inside sushi and a whole bunch of cucumber sticks. The amount of spicy crab was about two spoon fulls and she charged me extra for it! Total 6.95 for nothing! What the? Oh and they forgot my steamed rice. Started eating the basil beef (16.95) (which was loaded with veggies) without my rice and there was a grey hair in it!!!! Needless to say I will not be returning!!!! The sushi was less than mediocre 11.95 and 12.95. I can't believe I paid almost $60 for garbage!!!!! I feel like calling them and letting them know how crappy they are and should have their cooks wear hair nets!"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant a few times because it's close to our home and unless I want sushi from Harris Teeter (which isn't actually that bad), we come here. It looks legit with Japanese sushi chefs in the open concept sushi bar, but the sushi just never quite tastes right. It's always a little warm which is concerning with raw fish. Some of their signature rolls are creative and a good mix of flavored once you get over the fact the fish is room temperature or room temp plus. 

They've had a sign on the door for several months that they are hiring wait staff, and I certainly hope they find some help soon because the service is super slow. Don't come here in a hurry."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place, period. In fact, I've been going there for years and I didn't eat sushi before going there. My favorite rolls include sweet 18, Rasta, Hawaiian sunset, Blakeney. That's off the top of my head but I definitely tried and liked more rolls. Very clean and good for any group size."}
{"text":"Great Sushi by far the best I have had in Charlotte....Don't waste your money on all the high priced sushi places in charlotte. Higher prices does not mean better sushi !!! I have tried them all in charlotte and 18 Asian is the best !!!"}
{"text":"We very much enjoyed visiting 18 Asian and Sushi.  We had a few of the sushi rolls, and they were awesome...I can't remember the roll that my husband got, but I got the Rasta roll and it was so good and very different.  I always love to try rolls that are different from anything I've had.  I highly recommend this restaurant for the food and the atmosphere, as well."}
{"text":"I'm from California where the sushi is ALWAYS on point and has turned me into a total sushi snob. Don't even care how bitchy I sound right now. 

This place needs to step their game up. I got a chicken noodle soup, a roll, yellowtail sushi and a spicy tuna hand roll. The yellowtail was great, the roll was also very good. The handroll had problems. They added what I'm guessing they refer to as \"crunchies\" and in every other sushi restaurant I've been to, crunchies are tempura flakes...here, there are similar to individual rice krispies. Not what I'm used to and they had a funny flavor, or so I thought. I tried to ignore the funky crunchies but as I ate more of the tuna roll, I realized it wasn't the crunchies...the tuna was bad. It had a taste I have never tasted before at a sushi restaurant...like the tuna was straight spoiled. It looked normal and smelled fine, but it tasted so rancid. I couldn't finish the handroll and when I got home, I was sick. That's all I'm gonna say.

Everything else was fine and the restaurant had a nice ambiance. Unfortunately, I won't play with rancid fish and probably will not be back here."}
{"text":"I would give the service a five star. Our Waiter was very welcoming and pleasant. We ordered a variety of vegetarian entrees, the food was just okay.  The ambience was decent."}
{"text":"You don't go wrong with this choice. The lemon twist roll is the best I have ever had. Very unique.  The service is great and a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Thank you for being the best sushi place in the Ballantyne area.  I am a avid sushi eater whom recently moved to NC and glad I found this place.  Know that I ordered to go and the sushi was fresh and enjoyable.  Upon pickup I stayed for a drink and the owner was inviting while the bartender offered good conversation.  At first I had my concerns as the place was not packed, but please give this place try."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi in Ballantyne. I DoorDash it weekly because I'm always craving it! Their rolls are hearty and fresh and don't taste like the subpar pre-made grocery store ones. I've tried to give other spots a whirl but this place is my jam."}
{"text":"I liked it.  Right before Xmas my oldest sister and I were doing some late shopping at Home Goods and she suggested this place after hearing good things from her friends.  It was late when we got there but we were sat w/o a problem.  We even checked to make sure it was okay bc some of the tables already had the chairs put up on them, but we were assured it was not a problem at all.

Our server was nice and good since we were his only table.  We each had a glass of wine and started with shumai and calamari at the servers suggestion.  Both were great.  The calamari was served with a sweet chilli sauce, but it was was to spicy for wimpy old me.  We then split 2 rolls, California and shrimp tempura I think.  Both were good and fresh, not the best ever but definitely would order again.  And finally I had been craving yaki soba so we got that with just vegetables and I liked it a lot.  Nice and fresh tatsting, not overpowered with sauce or too salty.  We also each had another glass of wine.

Overall, very good and reasonably priced split between the 2 of us.  If in the area I would return."}
{"text":"WOW! Everything from drinks to appetizer to sushi was AMAZING!!!! I had the Lychee Mojito-my new fave drink thanks to room18:)"}
{"text":"Having a nice sushi dinner... The food and service is excellent.. ... The food is reasonably priced and the sushi is delicious... I'll be back. 

Ask for Mark he is incredible.."}
{"text":"Great Asian Fusion food. Beef fried rice is similar to Korean Kimchee fried rice. Its excellent. Their house specialty roll is amazing as well. Great service too!

I lived in Los Angeles for 20 years so I know good fusion sushi.  The only reason why I can't give it 5 Stars is due to the quality of the sushi.  It's good but not if you're looking for top shelf sushi.  I'm not being overly critical since IMO Cowfish isn't better when it comes to the quality of the sushi either.  I lived in California and Washington State for over 40 years.  I know good quality sushi versus premium quality.  It's good here, just not premium."}
{"text":"Good speciality rolls but high priced. Beautiful atmosphere and decent drink options. If you want a variety of specialty rolls somewhere great if you're traveling solo....this is the place. Nice bar!"}
{"text":"I would never ever recommend this place to anyone.  Food and service was horrible.  Food was cold and could even eat it. The server was rude as anything, she only came once or twice to our table and didn't even fill the water cup.  I was so disappointed, wasted my $80."}
{"text":"I came here at the recommendation of a friend just for the rolls.  Pretty interesting rolls for sure but just not memorable. I guess I also get an attitude any time I see so many fried rolls on a sushi menu.  I mean isn't sushi usually raw?! One roll I tried that had lots of tuna on and inside was even slightly charred.  I guess that was different but still... Sometime I guess I just feel like less is more.  The decor in the restaurant isn't exactly special, my drink was a little watered down and honestly I can even remember which rolls I had but I remember having a hard time finding one that wasn't fried...  It may be awhile before I come back.  I won't say it was bad, it was just.... Fried"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner at 815 and they almost sat us down, we approached the table and the waitress looked at us with true hatred and said \"NO\". The hostess then proceeded to walk away from us without saying a word. I asked why they had their hours online until 9:30 and they didn't know what to say. They were smirking and laughing to make it even more annoying. SUPER disappointing considering I've had this waitress so many times before and they were blatantly rude as fuck and to be completely honest extremely lazy. Don't come here unless you want TERRIBLE service. Never coming here again"}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple.  Ive enjoyed good sushi in many places, to include New York, San Francisco, LA, Hawaii, Dallas, Chicago.  Now I'm trying to find a good sushi place in Charlotte.  I'll have to keep looking.

Simply:
- No real Wasabi available when asked.
- Maguro Tuna was warm, and smelled old.
- Tamago was tasteless since it wasn't made by any sushi chef there.
- Miso soup was mediocre.
- Ambiance was not towards cleanliness (they had construction repairs going on during lunch)
- Didn't have Japanese sushi chefs so the attention to quality wasn't there.
- Waitress didn't know what \"real\" wasabi was and had to ask the sushi chef...who didn't know either.  Fairly good service for dine in with an empty restaurant though.

I'll pass on this one until they up their game."}
{"text":"Had another great find in Charlotte on my most recent trip and found some sushi! I enjoyed the Salmon and Albacore sushi. I should have tried the Tataki roll, decided to go with the Craig roll. I love Shrimp Tempura based rolls and this one was very good. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Oh how I wanted this place to blow my mind, as before I went I started to daydream about how great it would be to have a go-to sushi place less than 5mins from my house, but unfortunately it just wasn't meant to be.   

It's not that it was bad, it's just that is what just...unmemorable at best, and that is not a good thing, considering the prices are a cut above other sushi places in town and the actual food is unfortunately a cut below.   

Don't get me wrong, the place has a nice look inside with a cool atmosphere and the workers were friendly enough, but the experience just felt very underwhelming.   

For being so close, I wanted to really enjoy this place, but at the end of the day, it left me disappointed.  For the higher than average prices charged, it just didn't deliver where it counts.  The service and food were just passable, but I can get just passable for much cheaper at many other places around town, and who wants \"just passable\" anyway?"}
{"text":"This place is owned by the same people who own some of my favorite and loved sushi restaurants around Charlotte; however, this location is always a less enjoyable place to eat. The service is REALLY bad and slow. They are always desperate for hostesses and servers, which tells you a little something about how this place is being run...I really love their sushi and the ceviche appetizer, but sometimes the cravings are not worth the hassle. I wish this restaurant could get their act together like the other locations."}
{"text":"I enjoy the sushi from this restaurant but honestly, the service here is horrible. When we place a to-go order we always wait 30-60 min longer than they say it will be. THey just can't get it together at this restaurant. It's a shame. They are always hiring. I would not recommend this place to eat."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi restaurants in Charlotte.  Very fresh and flavorful.  The sweet 18 roll is a must try!  Great miso soup.  I love the fact that the restaurant is not overcrowded like Cowfish or Enso, my other 2 faves."}
{"text":"Charlotte has many Asian restaurants that serve Sushi. This is one of the few that have both Amazing Sushi and Amazing Service...what more do you need?"}
{"text":"Expensive, basic and they charge extra for brown rice. Seriously? It takes more time, money and resources to bleach the white stuff."}
{"text":"I was afraid this place was going to be just terrible because of the Yelp reviews but it actually wasn't as horrible as I expected.  

I got a house salad with ginger dressing and the Tokyo Triangle roll. The ginger dressing was probably the worst, and strangest, ginger dressing I've ever had. I mean, I ate the whole salad so it wasn't inedible, it was just weird. Like they put ketchup in it or something. 

The sushi roll saved the day. It's definitely a beginner/American kind of roll, as it's flash fried and crunchy on the outside, but it was delicious. If you're a beginner sushi eater, this one's for you. Because they flash fry it, the tuna inside is just sliiiiightly cooked so the texture it just a pinch more doable. If you're a hard core sushi person, I can't tell you how great it is because I'm not great at the raw fish thing. 

My friends got a side of chicken, brown rice, and a Cali roll, and another friend got the fried calamari. They both said it was delicious as well. 

I won't be going back for their weird ginger dressing but for their sushi? Sure!

By the way, not a very cozy place in the daytime. Very modern and sterile, which is maybe neither or good or bad."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place again and that was a mistake. It was a little bit busy and the pimple covered hostess told us it would be 5-10 minutes for a table. Perfectly fine. We got a Bud Light and a Coors Light at the bar that cost $8. Should have went across the street to the gas station and got an 18 pack for $15. We stood there for 20 minutes while there were multiple open tables. People came in after us and were seated and there were still open tables. We asked about it and were told that those tables were reserved. She finally took us back to the far corner table that had open electrical plugs and a huge pipe running down the corner. Needless to say we left. If you're not a privileged party, consider your money worthless."}
{"text":"This is a reliable family spot where I know my kids will be able to find something they like to eat. My son almost always gets the pot stickers - which he loves and the chicken and broccoli stir fry which he also loves. My daughter - who is fairly picky will eat up the edamame and gets a side order of lo mien noodles with chicken. My husband and I generally share a few rolls and there are a few that we really enjoy including the Sweet 18 and the Spicy Lover. 

The service can be spotty at times, but generally speaking we have a good experience as a family."}
{"text":"I love the sushi here. It's the best in South Charlotte. Great food. Great drinks!!  The sushi is always fresh. I love the ambiance. It's the perfect place to go if you'd like to actually have a conversation. We have house guests coming for Christmas. This will definitely be our \"night out\" choice."}
{"text":"I was just there for the first time and I thought the food was good. It was a bit pricey for a sushi lunch. The sushi was good and tasted fresh. Had the standard fare and ordered the 18 roll to taste something unique to the restaurant and plus the waiter said it was the most popular. It had a fried shrimp on top of a spicy crab roll with a honey drizzle/sweet sauce. I'm not usually a fan of sweet sushi but i thought it was good. I would go back again to try other specialities."}
{"text":"Showed up on Saturday afternoon at 3:50 PM to be told to leave immediately, which makes sense as no restaurant should be open at such an inconvenient hour! Truly hope they function as a reasonable restaurant with logical hours in the near future. Be warned they are open a mere 3 hours a day!"}
{"text":"First time and we enjoyed.  My son thought the Cali roll was better because it had smelt roe on the outside.  Crab cucumber salad was very good and the miso with seafood was good too. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place stays in business? Awful service, poorly managed, long wait...the food is good but ...ugh!"}
{"text":"The only redeeming factor was that the sushi was decent. After 10 months of pregnancy and no sushi I was really looking forward to it. My husband and I just had our first outing here post delivery. We walked in and 11:30 when they opened and they asked us to have a seat to the side because they weren't ready to open yet. Th chairs were all still up on the tables. We ordered our sushi which was pretty good. All tasted fresh. We received our check immediately after finishing and they had charged us for the wrong sushi platter (one that was $8 more than the one we ordered). Then the waiter came back and told us their credit card machine was down and asked us to wait 15 minutes until his manager got back. Well if you have ever had a newborn out to eat with you, you know 15 minutes may not be possible. My husband left while I sat there and went to an ATM. The manager came back in the meantime but never came over and said anything to us. I'm not sure what it was we were waiting on. We paid in cash but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered sushi from here and it was ok, certain only not the best sushi I've had in Charlotte. The Togo service was quite slow and the portion size was very small when it came to the fish. To have paid $14 plus tax and tip it's really not worth going back for a second try."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise.  My husband and I enjoyed everything.  The appetizer, calamari, was great.  The waitress recommended a very good sushi, Tsunami.  Our entree was awesome.  Great place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Here is the thing.  This place has wonderful sushi!  Like, really really good sushi.  We keep going back because we love their specialty rolls.  BUT every time we are there, we are frustrated with the horrible service.  Hostess is always on her phone if she is even up front.  Servers sit in the bar area and eat while watching tv on their phones FULL VOLUME.  When our sushi was made and ready to be brought to us, we almost got up and got it ourselves because our server was too busy watching tv on her phone.  The owners are rarely there, but when they are, the behavior continues in front of them.  It really baffles me.  You are lucky to get a refill on your drink, but did I mention the sushi is fantastic?  Maybe just get take out."}
{"text":"We recently relocated from San Francisco and are admittedly more than a little jaded when it comes to food.  That said, we've lived in Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Dallas and grew up in Indianapolis, so we're still realists with reasonable expectations.  DON'T EAT HERE.  A restaurant's sashimi combo is always a great test - of both the quality of fish and a restaurant's willingness to rip off the patron by including crap fish.  For $22, I received TWO - yes TWO pieces of IMITATION CRAB (read that again:  IMITATION CRAB = POLLACK) and a tiny shrimp (neither are sashimi, by the way) as part of my 12-piece \"chef selection\".  If these are the chef's selections, the chef should be working at McDonalds.  The sashimi that WAS part of the combo was wafer thin and of low quality.  Do yourself a favor and pick another option.  If you're looking for something fun and authentic, hit PePeRo - but then, that's another review altogether...."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Asian food I have ever had. Took one bite and sent the food back.  Was offered a replacement meal but it was so bland that I didn't want anything. 

Chicken didn't taste like chicken. Had a very chewy texture. Ming Fu in waxhaw is much better and half the price. Overpriced food. Service sucks."}
{"text":"The sushi here is good but not at all worth putting up with the ridiculous service. Wait time for my order was quoted 15 minutes and took over an hour. Unbelievably rude and dismissive."}
{"text":"Subpar sushi. Waitress was AWFUL. Was not apologetic about incredibly long wait, unfilled waters, wrong sushi order. The waitress took advantage of our large party (guaranteed tip) I am not coming back, ever.
If you're looking for good sushi, there is a restaurant called \"Jade\" within 7 minutes drive that's WAY BETTER."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, I would never go back.
As soon as we decided to sit down at the \"sushi bar!! \"( that is so covered around it's scary to think why they don't want you to see how they are rolling the sushi) we noticed such poor organization  all around the establishment, the hostess seems to be running around aimlessly doing whatever it is but her job, and this was at lunch time, wasn't really that busy.
 We could see people standing there for a while waiting  and some of them when sitting at the bar after waiting long enough,  were sent back to stand until the hostess figures out what next.
The exchange of dirty looks among the waiters, bar attendants and hostess is pretty evident. I can not imagine this place at diner time on a weekend.... Oh my lord! 
I think the only happy people there were the Hispanic sushi makers behind the bar speaking Spanish among themselves and singing their songs. 
As of the food......ough was not good, the chicken I ordered although it looked  good, tasted funny almost like it was border line bad.... the broccoli was so hard to eat,,,almost raw. 
No we won't go back and still in the search of a good sushi place."}
{"text":"Very good sushi but the fried rice dishes are some of the best I have ever tasted. Not much seating capability."}
{"text":"One of our first nights out after moving.  We tried a good bit of the menu, the noodles were good, sushi was pretty fresh and service was ok.  It was a little pricier than I expected, but I would still go back."}
{"text":"After living in Charlotte for about a year, and  trying 3 or 4 sushi restaurants, I've finally found one to that I'd return to. Having eaten here 4 or 5 times now, I've never been disappointed. I have only eaten sushi rolls at the bar and cannot speak to anything else offered on the menu. Everything I have tried has been wonderful. The fish and eel are all prepared perfectly and the sauces compliment the dishes well. Service has been friendly and attentive. One negative is the prices, which are a bit on the high side. This has not however kept me away and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Decent Asian food, nice trendy decor.  Only reason I gave it two stars instead of three was because of the bill.  We've been twice for lunch and both times they tried to charge us for dinner portions. Seemed too much of a coincidence for this to happen on two different occasions.  If you go for lunch be sure to double check your bill."}
{"text":"I rarely get a chance to get out for sushi because my wife doesn't like it. She generously agreed to go with me tonight so I could have sushi and she could order a salad or tempura or similar. My point is,  that it was a special sushi night out for me and 18 ruined it! 
Her salad was $9 bucks, our soda water was $5, and I left so dissatisfied after getting a $46 bill I felt like all I ate was an appetizer. I had to finish her salad just so I wasn't hungry when I left. I've never seen skimpier cuts of fish in my life. The sashimi was so thin I could read the numbers on my credit card right through it. The $13 Alaskan roll I ordered would've starved a baby seal. Absolutely pitiful. It's a shame when a business must put profits so far ahead of customer satisfaction. I will never go there again which probably ain't saying much because they'll be closed within a year unless the owner wises up. Baffled in Ballantyne.
P.S. From what I could tell the quality was there but if you're looking for a reasonable portion, this is not the place for you unless you're a scientist looking for microscope samples. I'm gonna need to bump up my readers to 250. The waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"I see why the reviews are mixed. The sushi is 1 star, but the entrees like chicken teriyaki and udon noodles are excellent. The sushi is over priced, not fresh, the options lack creativity and most rolls are fried and super heavy on the mayo and sauces. You cant get a good fresh high quality tuna or fresh salon roll. Its all the \"spicy\" ones which is low quality mush disguised as fresh fish. The prices are outrageous for what you get too. You can get better sushi from Publix for half the price- and thats not saying much!"}
{"text":"Poor service and mediocre sushi.....don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"The family and I and headed here last night. I was wary once I heard this was an Asian fusion place....and rightly so. The place just didn't deliver, and I think I am done with trying asian fusion places, the lack of authencity just makes it not worth it, and as a lover of Asian cuisine, I can no longer stand to pay for mediocre asian fusion.

I made the mistake of ordering the kimchi rice bowl even after I verified there would be no bulgogi, just beef fried rice. The kimchi was in the bowl and not even served cold on the side. The dish was as far away from legit Korean as the pad thai was from being legitly Thai. The veggie spring rolls and tempura were so tasteless. The salmon sashimi was decent. I didn't feel like what I was eating was proper Asian, and that was disappointing. I also think the look of the place makes it seem more upscale, but then you have regular jo rice bowls and a menu that doesn't match. 

Service was good, but it's a sad thing to say that what I found most appealing was the decor and the chocolate mint sticks we got with the check. The decor is modern and clean, tall black chairs and tables, mellow red wall and green lighting by the bar area, and eye-catching wall decor and lighting. 

I would maybe recommend this place for a drink at the bar, but definitely not for a meal. And that's a shame."}
{"text":"Worst place ever in charlotte. I order the sweet 18 roll, and 4 others... They were all not good. For some reason it was hard to finish the food, maybe it was the overload of msg in their sauces. I don't mind msg in food but when a restaurant puts too much in it gets hard to eat. The couple sitting near us had a really pissed look on their face, had three bites, paid and left. I should have taken a picture as proof but I was too angry with the food to think straight."}
{"text":"TAKE MY ADVICE: Order the tuna sushi, add cream cheese, and get it deep fried. Best. Sushi. Ever."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I have had. The food came out lukewarm to cold. I ordered beef and broccoli and a big lumped together piece of meat was hidden under my rice. When the manager was told about this, he said...\"this was normal, nothing changed on the menu, and he would eat it\". I let him know that, I have never been served beef that looked like this before. Given the caliber of this restaurant, this was unacceptable. He did not even offer a discount or something complimentary to make up for the cold food or odd looking lump of meat. I will not ever be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great very fresh sushi. 2nd favorite sushi place in the area. You will not be disappointed by the sushi, sashimi, rice or noodle dishes. Love the seaweed salad, miso soup, and gyoza appetizer. 

Nice table cloth place without the tablecloth prices. 

Parking  lot, casual dress, full bar, and outside tables too."}
{"text":"Never going back. Everything was wrong from start to finish. 

Considering the choices within 2 miles of here, Sapporo, Johnny's Red Bowl, Kami ... this was an overpriced, rushed, poorly presented eating experience.

First the sushi menu was all \"a la Carte\" and difficult to comprehend coming out of a busy morning at the office where my head was already spinning and I didn't want to have to study a \"spreadsheet\". 

I would have prefered \"Lunch Specials\" than having to pick my soup, Sushi Roll, and my specific choices. THEY MAKE YOU WRITE IT ALL OUT ... not pleasant when all I wanted to do is order and EAT. (The other Asian, Thai dishes are on the regular menu). 

Secondly there is no noodles delivered while you're waiting. It's minor - I know but makes a difference. And yea I know, Noodles are mainly Chinese ... so what. 

The waitress spoke too fast, was rushing trying to explain everything, and did not help the situation. 

My meal (3 sushi orders, 1 roll ) was $18.95 with NO SALAD and NO SOUP! At Johnny's Red Bowl (at the end of Ballantyne Commons Pkwy) you get a large salad, Fresh noodles and duck sauce, and Sushi Lunch Special (which is excellent and the owner is always there)  for only $8.95 !!

Finally they sealed the nail in the coffin on our bad experience by rubbing my wife the wrong way. SHE gave the credit card to pay - and they returned the bill to ME --- the male of the party. This killed it for my wife as it is her big pet peeve. It shows that a) No one read her Credit Card (which stated DEBBIE ... duh....) and b) assumed the male pays ... OUCH they killed it. 
She hates it when she is not recognized as the issuer of the Credit Card and acknowledged accordingly. I don't blame her --- its a sign of poor or non-existent training. 

They also  brought the BILL out while I WAS STILL CHEWING my food in the midst of my meal!! As if to rush us when we were one of only TWO COUPLES in the entire restaurant at 1:15 pm !!!! 

Underwhelming food. Disappointing presentation on the dish (no garnish, decoration, nothing), exhorbitant pricing, lousy service .... shall I go on .... or have you heard enough? 

We're never going back. Just another over-rated Ballantyne establishment that will probably close in a year.  Go to Johnny's Red Bowl another mile down the Ballantyne. It's PACKED with all the customers not going to 18 Asian!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this one shorter. This place is pretty expensive for the quality AND quantity that you're getting. This goes for sushi and other entree dishes. 

I got pad thai and it was simply mediocre. Not worth the $$. On the bright side, the service I've gotten here was good!"}
{"text":"Lukewarm uncreative sushi with no taste, the 'sesame chicken' was dried out chicken strips with a peanut/ sesame dip served over broccoli.

Lax service, waited over 5 minutes before anyone came to the table - and the restaurant was all but empty. The two servers on duty were hanging around the bar discussing their weekend conquests loud enough to be heard on the far end.

Overall a poor experience. Stay away."}
{"text":"Called in order for pickup at 6:15. It's now 7:30, and we are still sitting in lobby waiting for our order. Food is decent here, not great. But service is horrible. Needs new management."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday evening and was seated immediately.  They even chose a table that would have floor space to put our baby's car seat that would be out of the way.   Service was great for he duration of the visit. We ordered promptly,noir drinks remained filled and we didn't have to wait forever to get the check.   

The miso soup was tasty, very comparable to miso soup you would find elsewhere.  The sushi was good and reasonably priced.  I did not find it to be warm as another reviewer mentioned.  My in laws generally do not like Japanese food but we're very happy with their crispy sesame chicken and teriyaki chicken selections.  

We live nearby and will definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"It was Mother's Day and this place wasn't busy. First, the girl tried to seat my lonely ass in the middle of the dining room, then I'm waiting forever to have my order taken. I've been here before so I know the sushi is pretty good. I can grow hair above my lip faster than it takes to get my food to the table. One guy serving and people that came in after me got their food before me. I ordered the spicy tuna crisp. It's like a tiny deep fried rice cake and there's diced up spicy tuna on top with a spicy sauce. I also ordered a classic tempura roll. That's always good. So good. I had a drink, looked cloudy and had a thick kind of consistency, kinda like a nectar. Wasn't a fan. Then I waited forever for my check. I'll probably go back for the spicy tuna tho.......but takeout."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the sushi every single time my boyfriend and I have come here. It's become one of \"our\" spots. I enjoy the fact that the rolls are very thick. Yes, it can be a little awkward trying to eat it, but they taste very good! We usually order drinks as well, and every time they taste wonderful, never watered down or overly strong. 

My only complaints are that the service can be slow... you'll wait a good 15 minutes for a drink, whether they are busy or not, the food takes awhile to get out as well. While the staff is very friendly, they tend to disappear. There have been several times we wondered if our waiter was going to come back. Overall, it's a very nice atmosphere, the price is right, the food is great. We will continue to come back as long as things stay the same!"}
{"text":"Went in for takeout, and was surprised to see a pretty cool bar that had a really good crowd. The staff was friendly and the food was good. I thought the menu had a good mix of traditional rolls and some unique ones as well."}
{"text":"Solid options.  My friend loves the martinis.  They were as I would expect to be made.  As for food we did enjoy our options.  Crispy green beans were good.  Think they overkilled quantity of spicy mayo on side.   
Rolls were good but the sweet 18 was EXCELLENT!    Definitely roll of choice!"}
{"text":"We eat at 18 Asian and Sushi Bar at Blakeney frequently.  Yes the service can be slow but we have always had pretty good food.  We order the Ceviche every time and really like it.  I would highly recommend 18 Asian and Sushi Bar."}
