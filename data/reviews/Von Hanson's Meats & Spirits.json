{"text":"Love this place! Always smells great and the meat after you cook it smells even better. Excellent selection of beer and smoking chips."}
{"text":"I tried V.H. for the first time to process my elk. First their menu for meat processing options is very vague. When combined with a new employee is was a chore to work through the options.  After discovering that they don't vacuum seal I was told they would at least \"double wrap\" the meat.....they didn't. I was promised all 220lbs of my elk would be frozen when I picked it up. IT WASN'T!  Their prices are too expensive for this kinda service!  I will not be taking my business back!"}
{"text":"Quality meat, beer, wine and products. Not sure where the bad service reviews come from, but hope you give them another chance."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their chicken quality if far beyond the taste of grocery store's. Not inflated with water or \"other stuff\". Their ground beef is like BUTTER. Long gone are the days of opening your ground beef and seeing white stuff mixed in with your dinner. They do a great job with explaining why they are different from other grocers---if you don't know. While I have not tried their bread, I love the smell of their bread being baked fresh as I walk in (I'm a breadie so I try to not add addictions on). Coupons are always a help as well. Sure they may cost a bit more than the tube of ground beef from Fry's but I can ensure you it's better all the way around and well worth your money!  Try their bundles of meat-a great way to save money!!!"}
{"text":"Special time of year for me! You can have your x-mas dinner,Easter or any other grilling man's holiday. My gobbler on the smoker is always a hit. VH continues to deliver the best quality I've been able to find in the valley. I work in FB and send everyone who understands serious proteins there!"}
{"text":"Picked up some apple wood bacon, maple summer sausage and some pineapple, jalapeno, and cheese bratwurst (weird sounding, I know) both were incredible delicious and very very well seasoned and prepared.  Ill cut the talk and get down to the nitty gritty, this places meat is f*$%ing delcious and of the best quality. Go try it your self."}
{"text":"We have to agree with Kate M.  Very rude customer service.  Every time we come to VH we are never greeted, no acknowledgement, nothing.  I guess you have to buy over $500 of meat to get any service.  They would rather talk about some new car a customer bought than say, \"Hi\" to anyone else.  We will NOT be going back to VH.  Ever."}
{"text":"An outstanding meat market with the absolute best steaks and bacon, all butchered fresh on site.   They also carry different hard woods for smoking, and pellets for electric grills. That combined with the great local beer and wine, fresh or frozen cheese curds, and a variety of more exotic meats is a fantastic addition and out of your way trip to get quality meat. Skip winco, skip frys, this is the place you want to get your meat.   If they read this, I request more game meats!"}
{"text":"In the East Valley, this is the best spot to get you BBQ meats! They always have the best selection, always great quality. It isn't going to be the best prices in the valley BUT you pay for quality!! The Tailgater package is your best bet- hot dogs, burgers, brats, buns AND a small bag of the BEST pretzels ever!! They mist them in light oil and then roll them in dry seasonings_ WOW goes great with beer! Oh ya- they have a nice selection of beer and wines. TODAY- tried the green chili cheese brats... fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Nice little shop, very friendly, but very disappointed in my experience.  Ordered jerky and uncooked brats.  The man helping me touched both with his bare hands, answered the phone in-between, and did NOT ever stop to wash hands or use gloves.  I paid but the jerky is going straight in the trash.  The brats will get cooked so I'm not as concerned for germs.  I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"I remember my trip to Von Hanson's.  I wandered for 20 mins. trying to pick out something to grill for the family.  This place reminds me of butcher shops that I knew from my youth, and I can't find them now that I'm in deep adulthood.  The biggest reason for the long 20 minute wandering is the sky-high prices--- I simply couldn't find something that would be a good buy.  I was STUNNED SILENT.  Sure, there are spendy cuts, and sure, there were things I can't find at the local supermarket, but what if the prices were so high that I can't justify spending that much?  Most of the items they had were so PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE, that now I understand why they haven't expanded from this one location.  Now for the big 3:  Service:  They are spot-on.  There are many people behind the counter that are willing to help you at a moment's notice.  No problem with service. Price:  The prices are horrendously expensive.  It's a big part of the reason why I only purchased $80 worth of stuff, versus buying the meat that my family needs for $80 worth of meat. Taste:  Excellent.  It's exactly what I would expect from a cut of $80 worth of spendy meat.  I would've been disappointed if I'd paid this much for something that was A-OK.  In the end, I will likely only buy from here for special occasions, since the price is so high as to prevent this from being my butcher.  It's an excellent place if you want the old-time-feely-place like butchers used to be.  Don't go out of your way, unless you have endless money to spend for your dinner.  Bon Appetit."}
{"text":"A really great selection and fun stuff. It is more expensive, probably closer to Whole Foods' prices. Surf the specials for better prices -- they do those quite a bit it looks.   Boyfriend says beer selection was lacking thus the 3 star review."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great quality meats, dry rubs, smoking woods... You pay more for the meat than you would at Fry's, but you get what you pay for.  I highly recommend the AZ Cardinal Brats."}
{"text":"This is the only dedicated full service butcher shop selling USDA prime meats in Tempe. They also offer a decent selection of beer and in-house prepared side dishes, snacks, and summer sausage. They have roots in the Midwest but this is their only satellite locaton, and it is consistent with their Minnesota empire in both service and product."}
{"text":"After reading an article a while back in the New Times on the top 10 valley meat shops I made it a mission to try all ten. Mission complete and can honestly say that Von Hanson's wins the award hands down for the best in the valley. Perhaps the best on the planet. I have since been back three times and live 40 miles away. The seasoned griller steaks are melt in your mouth AMAZING. And at 10.99 a pound they're a smoking deal. They have a decent selection of craft beers too. Now if they would just open up a north valley location life would be perfect."}
{"text":"Hubby got a mule deer this past fall. Usually he goes somewhere else for processing, but decided on Von Hanson's this time since they are so close to us. YES!!! They have done the best job of any so far. The cuts were done so nicely! They did a wonderful job on the summer sausage (jalapeno cheese) and breakfast patties especially (maple....oh yum!!!)  I haven't been inside yet, but customer service over the phone was extremely friendly and professional.   I don't know how their prices compare to the other guy we have taken our meat to, but for the experience we had there, we'll be taking them any future game for processing."}
{"text":"FIRST TIME LAST TIME...           My wife wanted to try something different this Thanksgiving and it was to have someone, (a butcher) debone the turkey, more so that it would fit in the fridge because ours was a bit too small and the shelves don't adjust.         Our Son told us about this place that he has heard about it through other people but had said he never has gone there before.        My wife then made the phone call on 11/08/17 am and talked to Don about the deboning, he informed her that he has done this only 3X's while he's been a butcher but he could do it.       Wrote down all the info. and that was that. We get a phone call back from this place and wanted to CONFIRM with us that this is what we wanted and that Don had WROTE it down the right way, she confirmed that's what she wanted, and to pick the order up on 11/21/17.      Tuesday's here the 21st of Nov. and I (husband) went to pick up the special order, got there and there was a few people in line, (6-8) picking up their fresh turkeys that they ordered. I get to the front counter and the lady asked the name and the weight and I told her, she checked the list and a couple minutes had passed she comes back with a factory wrapped turkey, to me did not look like it was deboned. I asked her if it was and she informed that it was not. She then asked someone if they debone turkeys, and this person said \"no we don't\". She then asked me who I talked to and I said my wife had talked to Don. She said that Don was out sick and he had not wrote anything down. This is all going on while this person waiting on me was rolling her eyes like she did not really want to deal with any of this at all!  She went to the back and came back and said that they could debone a turkey that it would take 15 to 25 minutes. My wife was on the phone at the time and she reluctantly said yes. The lady went to the back and  let the butcher know and said she found out why Don was off, he was having surgery. After about the 3rd time this lady rolled her eyes and the stories are changing more and more, I said forget and left.... We live 40 miles one way from this place and was definitely looking so forward to this new place we found and a brand new way to roast a turkey......But it was not to be!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone to Von Hanson's since moving to AZ 8 or 9 years ago. We love their meat and buns, and have used them a couple of times for their game processing.  My husband took 180 lbs of elk to get processed. He requested to have all but ~20 lbs processed into steaks, roasts, and ground elk. The 20 lbs he wanted to be turned in to their amazing summer sausage. A week after dropping it off, we get the call that it's ready and head to pick it up...  My husband finds out they tripled the summer sausage amount and used ~80 more pounds of meat than requested to make the summer sausage. He verified on the receipt that it was correct and that they in fact processed the meat incorrectly. After going back and forth, they valued the meat at around $175 and gave us the gift card for that amount, so we could buy meat from them.   Thank you Von Hanson's for making this right! We look forward to using you in the future for our other game processing. (Fingers crossed we get something.)"}
{"text":"I was looking for some steaks to grill tonight.  I stopped by Whole Foods and took a look in their meat showcase.  They showed grass fed rib eye steaks for over $20 per pound.    I don't mind spending money on good steaks.  What I didn't understand what the 'grass fed' surcharge.  I know cows eat grass.  But why charge extra because the cow eats grass exclusively?  The butcher at Whole Foods simply said grass fed beef was better.    Now why am I talking about Whole Foods, in a Von Hanson's review?  Glad you thought that.  I figured I needed a alternative opinion.  I searched for 'butcher meat' on Yelp and found several shops.  Von Hanson's was close to my house so off I went.  Entering the store there is a selection of beer and wine to the right and a cold showcase of meats along the back wall.  The front and left walls contained freezers containing a variety of delectable deserts, a dizzying array of cooked sausages, and 'grill packs'.  In the center of the store was another freezer containing treats for pets.  I bought my dog a bone she will be chewing on for days.     I headed for the meat case and asked the nice man behind the counter if his beef was corn or grass fed.  His answer was immediate.  ' Corn fed, corn makes tasty and tender beef. '.  He spoke further of how grass fed beef may be a little leaner, but it is not as tasty.  I'm all for a healthy diet.  No need to get carried away.    There were two knowledgeable polite and informative butchers behind the counter.  They patiently explained the different cuts of meat and grilling methods to a woman who was planning a family dinner.  I agreed with his recommendation of thick cut rib eye steaks, simply seasoned, and grilled.    I am sure I will stop by this place again.  I love grilling and smoking.  Whole Foods is good for fruits and vegetables.  This is the place for meat."}
{"text":"Every time I go there I get a mini class in either how to prepare my steaks or what cuts are the best for what I am trying to make.    Top Notch staff and always a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is THE place to go for fresh meats in the East Valley. (the Pork Shop is good too, but a bit far away).  The brats and sausages are made in house and they have a huge variety of flavors. I really enjoyed the Chicken, Bacon and Swiss.  Besides fresh meats they carry dog treats, alcohol, cheese curds, and many other staples needed for a delicious meal.  They guys behind the counter are so friendly and very helpful.  Check it out!   I'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Once you buy a steak from von hansons, you will never buy steak anywhere else again.  This is the best butcher shop I have ever seen.  Also great sausages, chicken, cuts of lamb. I also get my thanksgiving turkey here."}
{"text":"Today was the first time we found the place, new to area. We come from NY and finally found a top notch place for meat. Reasonable priced for the the quality."}
{"text":"For real!!!! Want great jerky even the best jerky you've ever tasted?!! Come here. It is so amazing. We also enjoy coming here for the bones for my four dogs. They go crazy for them!! They have frozen burgers and they are amazing!! They chicken ones with cheese inside are the best thing I've ever eaten!! I love this place. Staff is super friendly and did I talk about the amazing jerky? The jerky is awesome. We came here weekly for it!!"}
{"text":"This place still rocks!  Love the people that work here and the way they joke around.  You gotta go here."}
{"text":"I love visiting Von Hanson's for several reasons!  I love the smell when I walk in.  It is a thick, rich, smokey aroma that you can almost taste.  The variety of meats is almost overwhelming but welcoming at the same time. I have tried everything from chicken kabobs, to several types of sausages, to the bacon wrapped pork (my absolute fave!!).  I have purchased the large bones for my dog, as well.  The bacon wrapped jalapenos are delicious!  I have never been treated unkindly, the staff are all very knowledgeable and very respectful.  I would say I go there about 2 times per month."}
{"text":"So my sister introduced me to this place more specifically their home-made beef jerky.  It has no preservatives and is pretty low in sodium and I've had it many times now (the girl is whack, she buys it by the pound and snacks on it all week long).  We went together tonight to stock up again and I was impressed by their amazing selection of meats - like Tarrah C. said, it is a \"meat lovers dream\"!    I buy a lot of fresh meat, mostly lamb, goat, bison, and on occasion, reindeer (though that is usually frozen)... this place had, as far as I could tell - all of that.. though it was in the frozen form.  They had a lot of pre-seasoned meat in the meat-counter (non frozen, obviously) that would make dinner easy to execute.  ONE THING, however, is that I asked about natural, grass-fed beef and they do not carry that.. bummer... hopefully with enough demand, they will someday soon carry it.. as now even Super Target carries grass-fed beef!  I made a mental list of all I will get here after my current supply of lamb and reindeer are out: oxtails!  more lamb cuts (bigger ones than the little shoulders I buy).  I saw the oxtails in the frozen section and once I finalize my plan on how I'm going to make them (we had a lot of oxtail soup in Spain and we loved it!), I'm gonna hit this place up.  So far, I am a fan..."}
{"text":"This is the best meat market that I have ever used/attended. I love the environment that these employees bring to the store. Great staff, and manager is simply amazing. Would recommend this place to anyone!!! Thank you for all your hard work, and nice/happy attitude."}
{"text":"Just went here for my first time with no idea what to expect. The guy behind the counter was so friendly and helpful! I had to leave quickly after picking out some frozen elk patties and a stuffed chicken breast because I seriously would have bought everything... Thanks for all the help, I'm so excited to cook my chicken!"}
{"text":"I was there again Christmas Eve and even told the woman behind the counter that my wife hated it when I went there. I find too much stuff and spend a lot. Love this place. Great product. All-natural. And the people behind the counter go out of their way to help the customer. Highly recommend. If you want quality meats, you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is a must! Every time I come in I'm always pleased with the amazing service I receive. Not to mention the food is incredible! The owners are the nicest and most lovable people on the planet and they have put together a wonderful place to eat. They also do cakes for wedding and events and the cakes she makes are amazingly tasty. Do yourself a big favor and stop by for breakfast and get the stacker or the cinnamon roll French Trost. It'll knock your socks off. Good food, good people, good everything!"}
{"text":"one of the best tri tips that i have ever purchased. that piece of meat was freaking delicious was totally reasonable! its been so hard to find decent quality meat since i moved here. safeway, fry's, walmart (bwahhaha no way am i buying cuts of meat from there), and other grocers just dont have high quality cuts of meat. you might luck out at an albertsons or if youre feeling froggy you'll head over to AJ's and shell out a pretty penny.  Von Hanson's is my answer to my lack of meat happiness. all the butchers were super friendly and very helpful when it came down to picking out something for dinner that night. all of their product looks delicious and fresh. i cant wait to try the filets or the ribeyes.   i cant believe this place is in walking distance of my house. eff ever going vegetarian. that would just be wrong."}
{"text":"Made my second purchase today (I had purchased a fresh turkey for Thanksgiving). I took off one star for pricing because they really are quite high (paid $40 for the turkey and $19.99/lb for the prime rib). The fresh turkey was really no better than any other fresh turkey I've purchased. I feel like pricing is high even for a specialty store. Took off another star because although the service is good they come across as a bit short and somewhat rude on the phone. I was also hoping since they tout themselves as a German meat market they'd have some good German beer but all they have are local brews for the most part. Otherwise some great stuff like pigs ears which my dog loves. The sausage is fabulous."}
{"text":"Just bought some great stakes again.    Best stakes in town and burgers.  Reminds me of Minnesota grilling.    We also process all our deer and have great results."}
{"text":"We recently purchased several items here after being recommended by a friend to purchase our Thanksgiving turkey at Von Hansons. The jalapeño poppers and elk jerky sticks were great. Our turkey totally sucked. Using the same method we have used several times before, we seasoned, marinated, and fried our turkey to golden perfection. Except when we served it we were greeted by the very distinct, unmistakeable taste of freezer burn. Thankfully being Thanksgiving we had also picked up a Honeybaked ham, and the holiday was not completely shot. Unfortunately, we had to throw out the turkey, stuffing, and gravy. Major bummer. Will not purchase another turkey here, left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"The Meat selection is AWESOME! they have everything a carnivore could ask for and then some. It has a great \"old school\" feel to it. lot's of craft beer and spirits as well."}
{"text":"We have gone here in the past for specialty meats and dog bones. Both items have always been in abundance at a good price. This time we needed a local butcher to process our wild game.  Von Hansens was able to do that as well. Very easy process to get our 40lbs of antelope finished into delicious brats and ground beef. Can't wait to share with our family friends. Oh they were very thorough about checking our hunting tags and licences as well.   Support local biz and quality products."}
{"text":"You know what costs nothing?  To say to your customers, \"Hey.  How ya doin?  I'll be right with you\" or  \"Good morning\" or \"Thank you\".   Or...get this...flash them the occasional smile.    Mr. M and I have been in here every couple of months for almost 5 years because we love their products and are willing to pay extra for them.  And they have a great beer and wine selection, and a good variety of wood for an afternoon BBQ.  And when I used to have a weekday off I could go in and there were usually a couple of older guys working who are so nice and I'd feel like I was truly in an old school butcher shop.  It was really a pleasure to shop there.  But the last couple of years there has been a huge turnover in employees.  Almost every time I go in there are different people working.  No smiles.  No greeting.    The manager will either be talking on the phone taking care of business, or, like today, behind the counter stuffing peppers, not interacting with customers.  I remember one time I came in and she was working, finished a phone call, looked right at me, walked in the back, came back out and talked to an employee, and nobody said boo.  It's just annoying.  Especially when this store is a niche with high prices.    Today there were a couple of customers ordering items from the counter and my husband and I went in to get some seasoning and some brats out of the coolers.  We got what we needed and went to the register.  When one of the employees finished getting items for a customer from the counter, she walked over in front of us and rang him up.  Fine.  He and his fussy kid can get on down the road.  Then the next employee comes over and puts the stuff for his customer that he was helping, next to ours on the counter, and I'm thinking, \"What in the heck do I need to do to get rung up here?  Go order some jerky?\"  So we did.  I asked the guy behind the counter if customers ordering things from them take precedence from the self-serve people and he said, \"I just put that stuff on the counter.  If you're in line you're in line.\"    OK.  Well thank you, Captain Obvious.  I've been standing in line for awhile now.    All the while the manager is standing there with her back to the store, stuffing peppers.    I probably sound a little petulant, and I'm at peace with that.  My beef is with the lack of friendly customer service.  I don't have to shop here and I'm really in no hurry to go back.  It's very disappointing."}
{"text":"Three cheers to Yelp for helping me find where in the Valley to go for real beef jerky!  The fresh stuff which has more beef than chemicals.  (The convenience store packages just were not doing it for me!) After checking out the website, I emailed good friends in Las Vegas (who used to live in Minnesota), asking if they were familiar with Von Hanson's.  (They have 21 locations in Minnesota - and ONE in Chandler.)  My roommate and I went on July 2. They were running a special for NY strips - buy one, get one free - so that was added to the plan in addition to the jerky.SCORE!  We picked up a half pound each of the peppered jerky and the cajun spicy.  $18/lb.  The NY strips were (if memory serves...) $14.99/lb, and the steaks were averaging a little over 3/4 lb - so super yay for the BOGO sale - it brought the meat down to regular grocery prices. I have to say - the quality of the meat is amazing!  Just looking at the cuts in the display case, I can declare Von Hanson's makes AJ's look like Fry's!  These were GORGEOUS!  Quite possibly the prettiest steaks I've ever seen!I also grabbed a couple pigs ears for my dog, and the roommate picked up a package of her favorite kind of sausage (linguisa).  Admittedly, I am not a sausage expert.  Plus, I live very close to Schreiner's - so while I would have no problem buying sausage from Von Hanson's, I wouldn't make the hike to Chandler just for those.  The selection was quite impressive, though!  Overall - this place has everything for carnivorial happiness!  (Hey - if you understood the context, it's a word, right?)  Great selection of beef, chicken and pork products.  Tons of spices, sauces, rubs and marinades.  Nice selection of unique beer and wines.  Fridge and freezer cases with more meats, sides, and desserts! Yes, it's pricey - but the quality is certainly there to justify it.  Once home, we grilled up the steaks using our favorite rub.  OMG amazing meat!  Probably the best steak I've had in YEARS - and NY strip isn't even my cut of choice!  The peppered beef jerky is full of YUM - and this is so strange to write - but the Cajun is a bit spicy for my taste.  (And I adore spicy!)  It's amazingly good, and addictive - but almost requires a cold beer to go along with it to help cut the heat.  The Vegas via Minnesota friends emailed back Monday - they know Von Hanson's quite well - and are grateful there isn't one in Vegas - it would KILL the weekly grocery budget with how often they'd be in!  They love, love, LOVE the place - and I am now under strict orders to bring them care packages from here whenever I come up to visit!  Oh - and Layla (my pooch) was pretty stoked about the pig ears - so in addition to my five stars, please add two paws up!  (I didn't tell her they have a whole dog food and treat section - I am on a budget, after all!)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best markets that i have purchased meats at over the past 3 years, and their service is outstanding. being a MN person and knowing them from there it is great. their selections of meats and poultry are far above the rest, they are the BEST"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. They have some great beef jerky and snack sticks. The topper is they carry Gates BBQ sauce. Why 4 stars? They don't have prime cuts."}
{"text":"Got some great ribs and rub here. Very friendly staff that is willing to help. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing! I was visiting Phoenix, and drove to Chandler just to check this place out. I'm glad I did!   I went here specially for their jerky. There were three flavors: Turkey, Cajun, and Regular. I asked Ralph which flavor does he recommend, and he gave me huge samples to try! They were all delicious, but I chose the Turkey and the Regular flavors. The turkey jerky was so tender and very lean. The regular jerky was smoky, just the way I like it!   I wanted to try their steaks, but since I live in California, I obviously couldn't buy any to bring back home! Next time Von Hanson's, I will be prepared for you and bring ice packs and a cooler! No, I'm not joking."}
{"text":"So I can't attest to everything in this store, but I can say I wish.I lived closer. We wee just trying to kill some time waiting for our stuff to be done elsewhere sho we stopped in. Carnivore carnivale! We looked through all the sauces, ribs, drinks, etc. Finally we had to decide on what to take with us and that would survive a decent length car ride. Ok sausage sticks are amazing. A pet peeve we both have is when you buy meat and cheese anything..Do you ever taste the cheese? Maybe a hint, but not enough. These guys have real cheese that actually has discernable flavor in their meat. So tasty tasty. We also got a bunch of brats which were fabulous and the meat trail mix, also awesome. Wish we could have bought some of their steaks but maybe next time we will pack a cooler!"}
{"text":"Delicious meats, and more!  The taste is so much bettter than buying from the grocery store.  It's noticiably higher quality.  Price is  higher, but worth it.  I also recommend the little box of Green Chili seasoning.  I've made it several times and LOVE it!  Also, try the dog bones.  Our dog loves it."}
{"text":"Ok so we have started coming here for the last couple of months we buy big amounts of meat because we feed our dog raw food.. They actually have raw dog food which our pup loves.. Plus this place has a large selection to choose from. And the Jerky is amazing!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place!  It truly is a Midwest butcher shop plopped down in the East Valley!  Originally out of MN, they have numerous locations there, and then this 1 location in Chandler.  It's the only place I buy meats from.    Great selection of fresh steaks, chops, marinated chicken breasts, kabobs, ground beef, brats, bacon, ribs, homemade beef jerky, numerous sides AND they even bake their own bread daily!  The staff is extremely helpful in picking out your selections and they even provide tips on how to prepare anything you buy.  If you are a chicken fan, you MUST try this place.  They have the biggest chicken breasts I've ever seen, and they have multiple marinated varieties to chooes from(garlic butter, pamesan, lemon pepper, tomato basil, and  buffalo chicken).  *TIP - get on their email list to get updates on the specials they are running.  It is very common for them to have \"buy 1 get 1 free\" specials on multiple things every week."}
{"text":"Everything you'd expect from your local butcher shop along with a couple unexpected surprises. If you love sausages, you'll fall in love with this place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I received some coupons in the mail so I went to check this place out. One coupon was for buy 1 get 1 free slabs of smoked baby back ribs. So I picked up what amounted to 1 full slab as they had already been cut into half before being put on display for sale. The ribs are $15.99 a pound, and my total for a full slab was about $17, after discount, so it was $35 worth at regular price. They should have been amazing. I asked the woman helping me for guidance on heating them up and she gave me some vague ideas. Heat in the oven at 350 until they seem warm - they are already cooked. So, that's what I did and I was very underwhelmed. The taste was alright, but there was way too much sauce on them. First of all, I don't care to pay $16 a pound for slathered on sauce, and second of all, if ribs are smoked properly they don't really need sauce.  But the ribs were very tough and fatty and way too much work to try to get the meat off of the bone. I have another half slab in the fridge and it will just go in the trash. For $17 I can get a full stab at some decent steakhouses with a salad and side, delivered to my table heated up for me."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade jerky and a good selaction of fresh meat. Good servie. We like to talk to Becky and Ralph."}
{"text":"Coworker recommended this place for fresh sausage for party we are throwing.  Walked in at 4pm yesterday and there was nobody in the store.  Only 1 butcher was behind counter and was on his cell phone talking.  I yelled 3 times \"HELLO\" within a 5 minute time period...with no response!  I even walked over to beer coolers so that he could see me, which he did.  Waited another minute at cash register and said HELLO again...again no response.  He turned his back to me and never got off his cell phone! I was ready and willing to buy 10lbs of sausage from this store but couldn't get anybody to acknowledge a customer was standing there!  I've read other similar reviews from yelpers, so this was not a one off situation. After approximately 6-8 minutes in this store I yelled a few choice words and walked out.  The guy working there never got off his cell phone."}
{"text":"It is not the cheapest for sure but worth every penny.  I also like chatting with the staff who have always been generous with advise on how to prepare a meal or which cut works best with what I am trying to accomplish.  If you are serious about steak this is the place to try."}
{"text":"Great store with awesome customer service. Dan helped us pick out our steak and brats while educating is on the different options. He even gave us some tips for preparing them. Everything we bought turned out delicious, without need for seasonings or anything. We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I would split the stars up if I could because there is no mistake that the product is good, however, I think they are very high priced. The employees are friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"I am writing this review on behalf of my dog Rocky.  On a tip I went here to get some treats for my dog.  They have an entire freezer of items for dogs.  I picked up a big bone and some broken down ones as well.  The bones are smoked and I am guessing delicious .  My dog is in haven when I give him a new bone.   The next time I will also be picking up some treats for me behind the counter."}
{"text":"I went in to get bone marrow, you know the appetizer they sell at high end places. They sold me one and when I got home it was for dogs. Seriously, wtf?"}
{"text":"Very friendly help and amazing summer sausage. Took some to a Cubs party and it was gone before I turned around. Nice selection of meats."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I went in today to purchase some Scot's Santa Maria seasoning and had a terrible experience. When I asked the employee if it was possible that the price was wrong because it was 25% higher than the retail price listed on scot's website, I got zero response. When I asked again, still dead silence. I guess he didn't want to respond, but ignoring a customer is ridiculous. I don't mind paying for good service, but to pay over retail for a product just seems like price gouging. Needless to say, I will not return to their store."}
{"text":"Von Hanson's has been in my neighborhood for a good 5 years that I know of. I don't go there very often because, 1. I am not that big of a meat eater and 2. because it is kind of pricey in there.  Recently I became very aware of GMO's in our food and the whole Monsanto situation. I decided that from now on I will only buy grass fed beef because we don't know if the cows that are corn fed, are being fed with GMO corn. Most likely they are because it would be VERY expensive to feed them organic corn. However, I felt like Von Hanson's would surely have grass fed beef right? So I happily made my way on over to VH's. I selected the cut I wanted, and as the butcher was taking it out of the cooler..I asked him if any of the meat was grass fed. I guess I was assuming he was going to tell me that it was grass fed..Unfortunately, he told me that NO...ALL of their meats are corn fed.   I left with my cut of meat, but I still felt a little disappointed that they didn't have ANY grass fed meat there.   Von Hanson's...if you can respond and let us know if your beef is fed GMO free corn...I will change my rating and update my review. Until then, sadly, ...I willl not be back."}
{"text":"I hate and love this place. I always go for one thing (usually treats for the dogs) but end up buying 4 or 5 other things.  Ground beef with bacon for burgers, jalapeno cheese brats, bacon wraped filets... so many choices... AND I'm trying to go vegetarian.  Not helping me out here are you Von Hanson's??    Oh and their coupons are awesome - buy one get one on a lot of stuff. OH yea and the stuffed chicken breast(with stuffing)... we pick up extra stuffing just for the holidays since it's always a hit. If you need something specially cut they will also cut it anyway you want. We get leg bones for the dogs and have them cut in thick rounds so they have hours of enjoyment."}
{"text":"Always a great selection, with helpful hints on how to cook different cuts! Order fresh turkeys well before Thanksgiving as they can run out!"}
{"text":"Super tasty sausage and good quality meat. You get what you pay for though and expect to part with some coin"}
{"text":"The other reviews say it all, best butcher in AZ!  Always great service and fine cuts of meat. The steak and chicken really set this place apart! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"This butcher shop is absolutely the best.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff that are willing to look over recipes and help you choose a cut of meat, make recommendations for dinner, and specialty cut anything you need.  I had a small difficulty with something I bought today, and they rectified the situation before 9am.  I couldn't be happier with them, and I'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Super cute place, lots of different varieties! Dennis helped us out, even have us a few things to try! Suckered us into getting a few things because it was so good!!! Definitely recommend the teriyaki beef jerky chunks or any flavor!"}
{"text":"Amazing meats! Get the jerky and a few bones for your dog. The grill steaks are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Coming from someone who really only eats poultry/seafood, I still have to give this place 2 thumbs up.  Went here with the hubby to get him a steak & also because our new dog trainer recommended it to get dog bones.  Amazing selection of meats as well as wine/beer and the staff was very friendly.  And how awesome that they have natural bones/treats for dogs??  We will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Staff was very helpful on my recent visit. I picked up some sausage stuffed mushrooms and some jerky, and my husband was very pleased with both. I'll definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Best customer service. Super friendly and easy to work with for Big Game Processing; very fair prices."}
{"text":"Wow amazingly clean.... wonderful meats with a huge selection.. Pellets and wood chips for you smoker at a great price. Great pairing to go with you meats. All you need is here.. Staff are very awesome they take the time to talk to you about different ways to cook things you just bought.ohh yeah huge selection of spices..."}
{"text":"Sirloin steaks go for $10/pound and are corn fed (it would be nice to know if the corn is GMO or non-GMO). I bought a little over a pound of the kabob meat (I was told that this was corn-fed sirloin as well) for $8/pound. I seasoned and broiled it up for dinner. It was reasonably tender and tasted better than grocery store meat. My husband stated that he did not like the taste as well as the Harris all natural beef (no antibiotics, no hormones, etc) at Sunflower Market for $4/pound less than the Von Hanson's meat. In addition to very pricey beef, they have poultry, fish, and other types of meats. They also have jerky, but it is sliced pretty thick so looked a little too chewy for me. They also have wood and other products for BBQs. Located in a strip shopping center it has easy parking close to the door. The staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place has a lot to offer and great quality meats and poultry, but they tend to be pricey."}
{"text":"I LOVE Von Hanson's I never knew about this place until my mother in law brought me there for some lefse bread for her aunt. They have the best beef jerky! I also love that they have roulade beef there too! Shane is very helpful and so are the rest!"}
{"text":"Oh c'mon the quality of the meat and the knowledge of the counter staff is ridiculous. So lucky to have this local to us.  Be jealous all you who don't."}
{"text":"Growing up in Jersey places like this are a way of life! So glad to find a butcher/deli just as good as what I knew growing up! The freshest meat and we will only get our meet from them."}
{"text":"This place has the best brats I have EVER had!  They are on the pricey side but trust me they are SOOO worth it!  The jerky is good too and if you have a furry friend they have a large variety of dog treats and foods too!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH  I regretfully say that I have lived 4 blocks from this place for about 2 years and have only knew of its existence for a couple of months.   The cuts of meat here are amazing. We have tried the filet, NY strip, 4 different seasons chicken breast, and pork chops. Everything has been superb. They also have a nice selection sauces, charcoal, wood chips and beer. There are so many things I have yet to try! They even have seasoned pretzels and amazing seasonings.   I have been in here many times and have always have a great experience."}
{"text":"Picked up some meats for my wife and visiting in-laws. 2 bacon wrapped filets, ribeye, chicken breast and kabob. Best cuts of meat I have ever purchased. When I was done grilling them, it was all I could do to keep them away while I was plating them.   You will pay a little more per lb. then at a \"supermarket\" but in the end, you will savor every bite. The cuts are bigger/thicker and the meat tastes better. Splurge on yourself. - you deserve it!"}
{"text":"Wow...what a place! Very friendly...wonderful selection. It was welcoming enough, but something about it screamed chain to me.  I was a bit overwhelmed at the selection of the meats and their brand of frozen foods -- I think I tuned out for a bit while walking around. It's not a huge store, but it's not small, either. They have a nice selection of frozen breakfast sausages that tempted me to buy a pack. :)  The samples they had waiting when you first walked in were some wonderful smoked sausages and a chicken sausage as well. I skipped those and went in for the free samples of the cheeeeeese cuuuurds!!! CHEESE CURDS! They were so good I even bought a pack. I flinched a little at the price - $6.49, but given that it's been driven across how many states, I found it reasonable enough to pay (either that or I really wanted the cheese curds and I'd use anything to justify that craving, haha).  There was a decent selection of beer and wine, but it's no Bev Mo. I found prices to be very reasonable and they had wonderful snacks/treats for Rex.  They had a wonderful creamed corn dish in their frozen food section and it's well worth the price as well.  Give this place a shot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Von Hanson's in N.Chandler (near the Gilbert boarder) - it's a name to remember for quality meats, tons of cool liquors, spices and rubs, and many other things.    I've been trying to change my bad habit of shopping big box stores and in doing so, have found many excellent local businesses like Von Hanson's Meats & Spirits.  It's been a lesson in life.  The upgrade in meat alone is worth the switch but the personal service you get when shopping Von Hanson's makes the extra drive completely worth it.  It turns out though, you don't even have to drive to get their products anymore.  They now feature the new Phoenix local delivery service called Pikfly.  It's so cool.  If you're having a party and run out of something, or just don't feel like leaving the house, Pikfly will pick up Von Hanson's (and many other local business products) and deliver right to your door.      So there's thousands of products packed into this little market but here's some examples of what you can get at this delicious meat shop... brats of many different meats and interesting ingredient combinations, steaks, smoked sausages, pork spare ribs, lamb shanks, capon, turkey, duck, beef short ribs, cornish game hens, hanger steaks, ground veal, pork chops, hamburger, buffalo patties, ground elk, chicken, brat patties, certified Angus beef, grill-ready meats, rubs, spices, BBQ sauces, speciality woods chips and logs (like cherry or sassafras) to burn in your grill.... little desserts like peanut butter crispy bites, deli salad stuff, cheese curds, specialty sodas, beer, liquor, wine... and even some beans to throw into the pot.  Ok, that's all I've got to say about that.  You can probably figure by now that I'm a fan.  The fact that I can get their stuff delivered by Pikfly now... well, that's just icing on the cake.  See ya there!"}
{"text":"So I have come here a few times now for steak and let me tell you that was much better than the brats I had originally bought on my last review. I like when they have sales on things such as the petite sirloin wrapped in bacon and ribeye in bacon are my ultimate favorites. I absolutely addicted but the price on the ribeye obviously isn't very cheap. I had bought two ribeyes wrapped in bacon and two tiny slivers of grilling steaks(the cheap steak) and a small dog bone for what else my dog... All came out to 32+ dollars. I was like whoa whoa whoa for all that?? Really?? I couldn't believe it because when I bought just two filets wrapped in bacon (the biggest slices) it was 10 dollars! :(  And to me that's an amazing deal for filets!"}
{"text":"I honestly can't say enough good things about Von Hanson's. We have been shopping here for several years now, and it is absolutely top notch!  The staff is very knowledgeable, and helpful. Whether it be tips offered on cuts of meat, or ways to cook it etc. they always will provide a helpful suggestion.   Some of the other reviews mention that Von Hanson's can be pricey, and yes that is true. However the the quality of the product is always outstanding. One way I have found that really adds value is by signing up for their email coupons. The monthly deals they send out are really good. They often run specials for buy one get one free along with many other promotions.   The frozen \"meat packs\" they offer are a really great thing. I personally love the Trim & Lean pack. It has a good  variety(several types beef, chicken, and pork), and is well priced!  Von Hanson's  also has a pretty good selection of wine and beer. Not to mention  a very good amount of bbq/smoking supplies.   There is a reason we keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Easily the best place in the state of Arizona to get your meats. I have made burgers and different cuts of steaks from this place and they were absolutely delicious, they are also priced great. Their recommended spices and seasonings are great. They also provide processing services to hunters. I HIGHLY recommend this place and can guarantee you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Best Meat Market in the valley!  Super clean and room enough to shop!  The counter people are so helpful and full of knowledge.  Never have had a bad piece of meat and everything always comes out so tender.  Best selection of rubs and sauces in the valley!!!!"}
{"text":"The store screams of a home town feel, the people working there are usually very quick to offer help and guide you through the large variety of fresh meat cuts, some unique and others as you would expect from a butcher. Knowledgeable and helpful in selecting what to pick up.  There is also a bunch of variety packs you can pick which is a nice thing to have as it forces you to try to cook a sometimes new and interesting meat.  Biggest bonus for me was that they sold not just charcoal but the same charcoal I was planninG To make a separate stop to pick up from BBQ island inc so it was a one stop shopping experience so to speak.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent butcher looking for better than a grocery store can offer"}
{"text":"So they carry a whole variety of meats and cheeses, sausages and pet food, even liquors like beer. Prices are high, normal thing for a Midwestern style butcher shop found in the middle of the Southwest, I can live with that. What I don't understand is the unprofessional attitude of the staff. I asked for a small bag of ice so I can protect the expensive meat I purchased there (temperature outdoors was 109 degrees) and I was looked at like I just descended from Mars. I mean if customers take the time to drive to this shop during the summers in AZ, at least th hey could do is to offer a little complimentary bag of ice, pretty much like other stores do. I had to stop at Lee Lee's and get one of their complimentary bags of ice. I'm done with this shop."}
{"text":"A HUGE thank you to Becky and the Team for once again making Lithuanian Sausage for our family celebration. Everyone agrees it is as good or better than what we remember from the corner deli in Chicago."}
{"text":"No stars but had to post something ..walked in wanting to buy beef ribs and some wood for smoking and wasn't even acknowledged. At first I thought, there helping others. Then realized that I was the only one waiting while 5 butchers went back to butchering. Then I thought maybe my husband will get help but nope no help for either one of us. Walked out with nothing."}
{"text":"I have to say the more and more I go in here the more goodies I find. The Jalapeno sausage patties are amazing and the Arizona Cardinal Braut with the cheese and salsa can't get any better."}
{"text":"Best beef jerky in the valley and the people are exceptionally nice!  Super glad I finally found a place here!  :)"}
{"text":"Amazing meet quality and selection, our favorite are the summer sausage! My little one Just loves it. The staff is really nice, they sure know their stuff.  A must try !"}
{"text":"As Karen W. has already stated, this place is a carnivore's dream! You walk in and are instantly greeted by beers/wines/sauces on your right, fresh meat/pickles/sauerkraut on your left, and great quality product to go around! They also sell dog treats and wood chips. Their beer selection isn't bad for a meat shop--a good variety of local AZ beer and California beer. Staff is very friendly and answered all of my questions regarding how to prepare bratwursts which was awesome as it was my first time.   Their fresh meat section is second to none with a wide array of pork, beef, chicken, brats and wieners. I overheard the staff telling another patron that they had just cut/prepared the meat on display the night prior. So good to know it's as fresh as it looks! They also sell their own BBQ sauce which I will definitely have to try in the future."}
{"text":"Great selection for meat in the East Valley. Their beef jerky may be the best I've ever had. Courteous and knowledgeable staff is helpful if I have a question or need an idea for dinner. Been a big fan for years."}
{"text":"I went in to buy a center cut filet wrapped with bacon. They sold me what I thought was that, but turned out to be end cuts pressed together. When I called in, the guy I talked to was unapologetic, acting like it wasn't his problem. F you guys, you just lost a customer."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Von Hansons for a while now. Coming from a family who owned a meat shop back home it was nice to find one here that was similar...except that it is not.   I generally like the selection of sausages and pork. Plus, they have a freezer section with all sorts of options if it's not fresh in the case.  I've found the service is better when it's busy. They let you browse and check-up on you every once in a while which is nice.   However, over time I have found myself less and less inclined to purchase my meat from Von Hansons. Why? Because for a meat shop they do not cut-to-order and their portions are gigantic. I am 5'2\" and in no way need a 16 oz. ribeye, and yet, that's all they ever have, or else they're larger. I've asked for a smaller one only to be turned down. I don't have the space or the need to order an entire ribeye cut into 10-12 oz. steaks. Same thing for the marinated chicken breasts. While they are more willing to butterfly them, I have noticed they free-hand the cutting and rarely do a good job. I would be better off to butterfly it myself and I freely admit I'm not great at the practice. The prices are okay, but a little high considering they only offer choice beef rather than stocking both choice and prime.   If you need a good selection of meat, are in the East Valley, and want to avoid the grocery stores then Von Hansons is a great option. However, if you're looking for prime beef, cut-to-order service without calling ahead, and a true butcher experience look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat Meat............MEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAT!!!!!!!    Guess who got a new grill/smoker and has been smoking the living crap out of every piece of meat he comes across..... No not the Dalai Lama... Why would you even think that? Weirdo.  ME! I did. That's who, ME!!    So I stopped by the old Von Hanson's butcher shop to check out the selection.  It is a great little shop.  It reminds me of a butcher shop that would be in Back to the Future. The butchers are wearing all white and  are very patient and knowledgeable about meat.  As far as I can tell they come in pairs like the Sith do, there was the master and an apprentice. The master was an older man who is very kind and well spoken and the apprentice has a mustache like Wesley from the Princess bride.   I ended up getting two racks of ribs for the price of one.  It was a sweet Yelp deal that I was happy to take advantage of.  I also got a sheet of beef jerky about the size and shape of Rocky's head from Mask.  They have probably the best beef jerky that I have ever tasted.  Even if you're just stopping in for a gander, you have to get a piece of jerky. It is worth the drive.  I think I got three movie references into this review.  Not a record by any stretch, but worthy of a mention."}
{"text":"Great meats and fish. I highly recommend the Jerky and their bread is very nice also. I've tried a few different cuts of meat over the years but to be honest a big Sirloin seems to work the best for me. Try a some of this and that until you get your favorite cut."}
{"text":"Good stuff old school. I like it. Enough said. The yelp computer is making me add more so it will be a review and not a tip. I bought a bunch of burgers and some sausages threw them on the grill they were great got one of their seasonings it was great as well."}
{"text":"Today we had the delicious French dip brats. Oh boy they were amazing! Von Hansen's is our go to place for meat, they are magicians."}
{"text":"It's pretty much a carnivore's dream here. They have various cuts of pork, beef, with some marinated chicken breasts. They even have a whole turducken in the freezer section for the ultimate poultry feast! They have a wide range of fresh, frozen, and smoked products, and chances are you will find something you will like to take home (Whether you had planned it or not!).  We came here in search of fresh bacon and some sausages. They have an extensive selection of summer, smoked, and snack sausages in various flavors. They sell 2 different kinds of bacon- applewood and hickory, both double smoked. In addition, there is a varied selection of raw meats, treats, smoked pig parts, and organ meat for your dog.   Non-meat wise, they have a good selection of wine and beer, various hot sauces, bbq rubs, oils (Including avocado oil), and bbq sauces. They also have a fine selection of various smoker wood chunks and chips, including woods such as cherrywood, applewood, hickory, etc.  The cuts are big here, so go here if you are looking for a hearty meal to cook!  We got some applewood smoked bacon ($8.99/lb.), a pound of Andouille smoked sausage ($6.99), and a smoked pig snout for our dogs ($2.99). The applewood bacon has a lot of moisture in it, so cooking times will be extended to make a crispy piece. The taste was OK, but I prefer The Pork Shop's bacon to Von Hanson's. Von Hanson's bacon was more salty, which hid more of the natural flavor and smokiness than bacon at The Pork Shop. Still, Chandler is a lot closer to us than Queen Creek, so we will be frequenting Von Hanson's for freshly cut meats and pork products!"}
{"text":"Best beef jerky in Arizona. Not overpriced clean friendly store worth the drive"}
{"text":"I've stopped in here a few times within the past few weeks in order to pick up some meats. Notably, their filet mignons are probably the best that I've ever had. I've been experimenting with sous-vide cooking lately, and those thick filets really take well to it. A nice sear on each side, and you've got yourself one hell of a date night!   The last time I stopped in I was tantalized by some other items, so I picked up some jalapeño poppers, chicken breasts, and a tri-tip. Everything was supreme- absolutely supreme. My only complaint is that they don't really do orders- I asked about getting some hangar steak and they pretty much said:  \"Yeah, sometimes we have it, sometimes not...\". Their selection is a little on the limited side (as compared to some other places) and they don't really do much custom work, but what they have is solid, and everyone who works there is always extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Really nice staff here. The butcher who helped me out was knowledgable, and really helpful. The quality of the meat here is excellent. Overall I recommend them!"}
{"text":"Great meats and sausages.  Been here twice now and both times got great stuff. Love the French dip brat and the blue cheese. Super good.  The jalenpeno cheddar is really good as well. Definately worth a visit. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Exelente servicio muy limpio muy rapido en atenderte todo muy bien vigilado recomendadisimo"}
{"text":"I wish I lived in AZ so I could do all my meat shopping at Von Hanson's. This review is mainly for the excellent beef jerky.  A friend in MN bought me some of their peppered beef jerky which spoiled me for all beef jerky. I knew I could never eat the crap you buy in the grocery store EVER AGAIN after eating Von Hanson's homemade variety. So when I knew I was going to be in the Phoenix area, I knew I had to stock up.  Their beef jerky actually tastes like real beef and has the chewy texture you would expect real dried meat to have. It does not have anything in common with the softer artificially flavored varieties you find at your grocery store and is actually more affordable! A tiny pack of crappy stuff costs $8 whereas you can get a full 1 lb. for $18 at Von Hanson's.   Since I was traveling I had to limit myself to non perishable items or items that could make it without a refrigerator for a few hours. I bought the peppered jerky and passed on the Cajun flavored one. They have a large selection of sausage sticks too. I purchased the smoked beef and hot jalapeno sticks which are delicious! They are smooth on the inside and don't ooze orange fat as you are eating them."}
{"text":"Great selection of different cuts of beef.  Decent selection of items from the midwest such as Door County pastries. Good dog treats also, pig ears, bones, etc. Surprisingly has a good selection of craft beer also.  Prices are higher than the chain grocery stores but the quality is there to justify it.  Love the beef sticks and sausages.  I'd avoid the typical deli items such as the coleslaw, potato salad, etc and get that at a regular grocery stuff. Great service also.  Use their coupons and save a mint."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed with the horrific service I just received from Donald at Von Hansons. I came in with a Gift certificate from the South Dakota cattle women's assoc to be used to purchase beef. It is issued by Wells Fargo bank and says to the merchant that it's the equivalent of a check and should be handled in the same manner as other checks received in the course of business.   Donald flippantly said they are not from SD and walked out of the store. The gentlemen helping me said he's not taking the certificate. I said really,  I thought he was joking. I called out to him and he said we're not a grocery story and not taking it and walked out.   I paid for my steaks and left asking his name on my way out as he stood outside the store.  I can understand he may not have seen a certificate of this type and may be leary, but to be treated this way without any type of consideration was unacceptable. Had he let me offer to use my cc if it didn't pan out or give it a second look, it would have gone a lot further then to be nasty. Just unbelievable and not the customer service I would have expected from a specialty grocery store (as you note on your website)."}
{"text":"So happy to be a part of this literal sausagefest (as opposed to the figurative kind, which gets old pretty fast). Spent years of my childhood in Europe so I have a special spot in my heart reserved for the love of sausage and wurst. Could be that it's a growing cholesterol clog, but this place makes me want to feed that beast!  Have tried the jalapeno cheese brats which are phenomenal! They do not hold back the spices in these, and they are a sight to behold when grilling as they sizzle and spurt and ooze juices and cheese (see uploaded photos)! I also made a special trip here for the Cajun andouille sausage, which was surprisingly not as spicy as the homemade varieties I've had in the past. I did incorporate the andouille into a traditional Louisiana staple (red beans and rice) which was delicious, but I felt it was best used in place of linguica on top of pizza.  The variety of hand-made sausages and goodies have instantly hooked me as a loyal customer. I know I will be back when my serum bratwurst level dips below a safe threshold and I am compelled to return it to its former artery-clogging glory!"}
{"text":"An amazing meat market in Chandler, AZ. They sell Minnesota grown beef, pork, jerky, the best hot dogs in the U.S. and more! I grew up only blocks from the original market in Apple Valley Minnesota! Every time I walk in it reminds me of home along with the excellent customer service. Just heard that they're opening a Von Hanson's in Scottsdale later this year 2013"}
{"text":"Wow great brats, dogs, and buns.  A tremendous meat selection.  If you need a gift idea, they have some gift bundles that work.  Great staff, helpful.  Not a fun of the pretzels.  You need to try, hidden on on West part of a mid street strip mall."}
{"text":"I cannot review everything. I am sure their fresh meats are very good.   But their jerky is some of the worst I have ever had. Its consistency is similar to shoe leather. Imagine if you bought some terrible Jack Links jerky from the grocery store and left the package open for about a week and a half to complete dry out. That's pretty much what you're getting with Von Hanson's jerky.   The worst part: the meat is absolutely bland. There are no marinades or moisture to be found. The only flavor comes from the dry spices on the meat (which are little more than your basic cupboard spices). But the meat itself has not absorbed anything that could be remotely considered  flavor.   The people behind the counter were perfectly nice, and I would probably eat anything else in the store. But their jerky recipe needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out after seeing an ad in the paper awhile back.  Looking for something quick and simple we got ground beef and made burgers on the grill. They were fabulous and I am not a big fan of burgers so that is really saying something! We also picked up some coleslaw, beans and macaroni salad and ended up with a great family dinner for under $15.00.  Butchers are also very friendly."}
{"text":"What a find in the phoenix area! I was on the hunt for some lamb meat and found my self at Von hansons walking out with a bag full of goodies. Every thing was delicious. The beer brats, fresh beef jerky, the seasoned steak, ground lamb and kielbasi. Yeah I went kind of crazy. They even bake their own rolls which were really good too! The staff was super knowledgeable and friendly as well. They even have pet food products :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They have a huge selection. Prices are reasonable and butcher was super friendly. They even have a selection for fur babies! You can also purchase things frozen for another time which is perfect because we came from tucson.   We ordered 4 New York steaks and bought two packages of brats. The brats come in a lot of different flavors. We chose the ones with pepper jack cheese and polish option.   Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I am so sick and tired of writing sub par reviews, I totally forgot I haven't Yelped Von Hanson's yet.  I've been here three times.  I am proud to say I live so close to it.  The meat here is amazing.  The butchers are friendlier than Disney World employees.    So far I've had the Ribeye's twice and filet's once.  What's great about this place is they don't pre cut a bunch of filets and sell them.  They ask how big you want it and go in the back and cut it.  The sausage selection is out of this world but I haven't had the time to make them.  They come frozen.  I've tried the bacon wrapped jalapenos stuffed with cream cheese and I was impressed.  What was strange about them was out of the 6 I bought, 1 ended up being one of the hottest things I have ever eaten.  In fact, I had to wait about 20 minutes before I could eat my dinner in order to enjoy it.  If you love cooking meat and have some extra money to spend, come out to Von's.  It's amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I brought in a bear to be processed about 2 weeks ago.  When we ordered how we wanted it prepared, EVERYONE told us that spring black bear typically tastes really bad.  Let me tell you, I've eaten my fair share of elk, deer, caribou, antelope, and this bear meat processed into burger, summer sausage and pepperoni stick is AMAZING!  Thank you Von Hanson's for the most tasty seasoned beef (bear) sticks and summer sausage.  The burger meat, if no one knew, would think it was beef.  Thank you again for such quality.  We have definitely found us a new butcher.  Great job!!"}
{"text":"Best butcher we have found in the 7 years we have been here.  Quality cuts of meat are outstanding.  Service behind the counter has always been great.  And it's true what they say the buns are the best out there.  If you like brats the Arizona brats are awesome with the melted cheese and hint of jalapeño.   And if your dog likes bones and what dog doesn't it's a great place for treats.  Do yourself a favor and buy your meat at Von Hanson's."}
{"text":"this is the store of my fantasies.  this is a MEAT store, people! if you know me at all, you know i love meat. love. meat. and spirits.  i don't like candy, cupcakes or sweets at all. so this is like MY own version of a candy store. the selection and quality of their meats are the key selling points at von hansons. jam packed full of carnivores every time i go... but there's something comforting about standing shoulder to shoulder with my fellow meat eaters. like a tribe. salivating over meat. the meat sitting there on display, behind the glass, like shimmery diamonds of gastronomical hedonism. i have no idea what the hell that meant exactly, but you get the picture.   on many a sunday you'll see me behind a grill (ok, i don't actually do the grilling, but i do stand admiringly around the flames grinning like a fiend). so this means almost every saturday i make a stop at von hansons.  here's just *some* of their tasty morsels on display:  beef kabobs bacon wrapped ribeye t-bones sirloin filet mignon (never leave here without one) NY strip porterhouse lemon pepper seasoned chicken garlic chicken whole chicken roasters stuffed chicken breasts pork roast pork chops pork tenderloin smoked salmon cajun jerky BACON summer sausages bratwurst polish sausage turkey jerky cheddar dogs bbq smokes season hamburger patties  they also carry a full line of deli meats, cheeses, potato salads, cole slaw, garlic breads, seafood, desserts...... BEER! let me say it again, BEER.  i could go on and on.  but i won't."}
{"text":"when I'm in Az'' this is my meat market they have everything. We smoke a lot of brisket and these guys don't disappoint with product. They get most of the meat from the mid-west and its the bomb'' the best snappy hot dogs around and I'm from San Francisco! No Joke!!"}
{"text":"This place is our go to for brats and kielbasa! Very attentive staff and love the quality of their proteins!"}
{"text":"My guy loves him some meat and this place is a go-to spot for some nice cuts of meat. They have a lot to choose from here. Specialty items as well in their fresh and frozen section. You can also shop in their seasoning and sauce section and add some new flavors you don't already have in your pantry. We got to slabs on ribs for around $50. He loved them. Im not a huge meat person but i did try a few and they were delish.   I will be back to pick up some of their special chicken they have !  Decent beer selection too- not excellent in regards to other places you can get good craft beer but still decent."}
{"text":"Selection was good. Bit pricey but worth it. Service was just okay. No one came out from behind the counter to offer any help even though it was just us 2 in the store at the time. Didn't suggest or offer buns even though I was buying burgers and chicken salad. My bad, I know...but I'm just sayin'. Also wouldn't give me 2 copies of their sale flier because \"they were expensive to print\". I thought he was joking, but that's less advertising material I can share with my friends and family...so this one is their bad!"}
{"text":"First time in today and I walked away with a bag full of good stuff.   Huge selection of choice meats all sorts of other good stuff. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love to stop in for the jalapeno poppers, jalapeno burgers and great selection of beer!"}
{"text":"After growing up on a cattle ranch in Texas it has be a little tough to find good meat in Phoenix.  Look no further than Von Hansons!  They are knowledgeable and friendly and their product is far superior to anything at a high priced grocery store.  You may pay a little more but the quality is worth it."}
{"text":"Great little meat market. They sell the best cuts of meat as well as homemade sausages. They have dog treats made from smoked and dried beef and pork.  We picked up some bratwurst and natural hotdogs and wieners for the grill. I love the jalapeño cheddar cheese brats. we got a pig ear for our dog. She devowered it. The ones we got from other stores she would just carry around then burry. They have so much good stuff here we are excited to try more. You pay a little more for things here, but the quality is worth it."}
{"text":"This butcher has the BEST fresh meats!   The meats from here are superior to anything you can buy from anywhere else and it is delicious!  Especially after hearing about all of the \"fillers\" most stores put in their meat, you know you're getting the good stuff here.  We even get our Thanksgiving fresh turkey here and marrow bones for our dog too!"}
{"text":"Best place to get all kind of meats. I buy their marinated chicken there the best. once you try the chicken you will never buy from another store. They also do game meats, jerky, dog bones for fluffy, and many kind of beer & wine. I drive out of my way to buy my meats. They have a very friendly staff & the owners are wonderful family run business. I would highly recommend them to all my friends & family. A must visit."}
{"text":"We came here specifically to pick up bones for our dogs to chew on.  They have a little open fridge with beef shanks, pig snout, and others in there.  The beef shank is sold by the pound and to get two of them was a little less than $10.  That's a good bargain for a bone that will take my dog MANY hours to finish.  it's good for her teeth and she loooves it, so win-win.  They also sell other kinds of dry doggie treats in little plastic bins and there was a sign that you could custom order a cake for your pooch!"}
{"text":"\"To me, life without veal stock, pork fat, sausage, organ meat, demi-glace, or even stinky cheese is a life not worth living.\"  ? Anthony Bourdain  This little shop has it all:  wood chips, charcoal, wine, beer, spices, BBQ sauce, all-natural dog treats, and many cuts of meats from all sorts of animals.  Truly living up to their shop name, it is meat and spirits galore [mainly meat though].  So on our recent excursion, I bought some andouille brats and jalapeño & cheese brats to grill up.  I wanted to grab a jar of sauerkraut but Mr. W. voted against it.  What a stick-in-the-mud! Anyways, after boiling the brats and tossing it on the grill, we feasted, and it was delicious --- especially the jalapeño one. This place is a bit pricier than your average vanilla supermarkets but that's the price you pay for freshness and quality. Next time, I'm getting me some steaks.  Walking into this shop makes me feel like a caveman.  All that meat and beer!  But then I realize I'm wearing heeled booties with jeggings and it stops me from chestbumping every guy I come across. Just kidding... I chestbump the ladies. *sassy hair flip*"}
{"text":"If you have never been to this place you have to check it out! I am from Minnesota and used to frequent the Von Hansons in St. Louis Park.  When I saw the sign in Chandler I couldn't believe my eyes. This is the best meat market on earth. You will think you are in Wisconsin or Minnesota or Iowa by the quality of the meat. They also have awesome dog treats! Did I mention that they have a wide selection of microbrews? They do. Check it out."}
{"text":"We really like the variety and service at this place. We weren't impressed with the marinated meat, but aside from that everything that we have purchased has been quality. Also there are a ton of spices, rubs and marinades for you to choose from in their store which is really helpful when you are looking for something unique. The staff is super helpful and they will always answer questions with a smile on their face."}
{"text":"What a fantastic store, they will be getting my business again. I stopped in to get a couple New York Strips and walked out with much more, even some great stuff for my bullmastiffs at home.   The quality of the meat was great, the staff was extremely friendly, the prices were actually a little lower than other local butcher shops I've bought from, and the selection of items extends way past steak.   You just can't go wrong with Von Hanson's, they've made me a regular customer."}
{"text":"If you like to BBQ and eat Meat like I do, this is definitely a good place to go. They sell different types of woods for your BBQ Grill, different types of sauce and all kinds of fresh meat that u can get. I personality don't drink, but they seem to have a good selection of beer for you too choose from. I only saw one person working in the front. Not only he was hardworking in the meat section as well as working as a cashier, he also walked up to the front helping customers who need help with shopping. I was extremely impressed with his work ethnic and helpfulness."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is a meat lovers dream!   The meat is a bit pricey, but, everything looks so clean and fresh! Great color on all their meats.....tons of bratworsts and links, bacon, jerky, beef and elk sticks, shish-ka-bobs, whole turkeys (anytime of year), and a lot of scandinavian foods.   We met the owner Gene, so nice! He explained how he has 28 shops in Minisota, and only one out this way (this one). Not only do they sell their own meats (and prepare them) but they have a whole line of BBQ sauces and rubs created by him. He will let you sample any of the sauces or spice rubs, just ask! He even gave us a free jerky sample, (btw, the turkey jerky is insane!!!) we ended up buying three pounds (buy two, get one free...) I bought one of his spice rubs (Special Rub) and used it on my husbands steak this evening, he said it was super good....  Can't wait to come back to get some wood for grilling (he sells tons! apple wood, peach wood, mesquite, and I can't remember what else, but a bunch of others....) This is just a great shop with great people to make the experience that much better!"}
