{"text":"So I brought the Lunch Special Lady(or \"Princess\", said Jen K.) to have a Lunch Special at Watami. After we sat down in this modern Japanese environment, all she did was STARE behind me. She couldn't take her eyes off of it, whatever it was. Cute guy maybe?   I turned around to find a wall mural of a Japanese woman showing her shoulder/back with a large Asian tattoo on it. So that's her FANCY eh, take notes people.   Lunch SPEICAL anyone? Don't mind the spelling on the Menu because it's a Chinese run restaurant in Market Village. It's definitely got value comparable to the Japanese Food Court spot on the 2nd level of Pacific Mall, however this is a dine-in space and it was full of patrons so at least the turnover of your miscellaneous Sashimi & Sushi should be fresh even if it's not the best prepared and displayed ever.   BTW, Miso soup was Hot Water + Miso. At least it looked like that, so maybe they didn't even bother with the Kombu and Katsuobushi stock. Take it as something to wet your mouth before the actual meal. I give them an extra 0.5 *Stars* because it's almost worth $5.99(Bento from) to seat and enjoy a Japanese meal in this setting."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars.  Dinner experience is a little disappointed.  The AAA steak set dinner ($16.99) is pretty good. Cooked to medium rare, the way I like it without request. But what if I don't like medium rare. The salmon maki should not be serve with the steak on the same plate. The seaweed gets soaked with the gravy and it is not crispy anymore.  The $1 Grilled lobster is great!! I cannot complain about that. It is nice, fresh, juicy and cook to perfection. My boyfriend kept digging for more meat, so it must be really good!  The Sushi/Sashami combo ($39.99) was not that great. The fish are ok fresh. But the sushi selections without any uni, eel, fish roe.. just egg, flake crap meat and some of the normal selections.  The miso soup still a miss... especially when we were there at the end of the day, tasted like they water down a lot.   I might be back or I might not be back... but I for sure not going to order the Sushi/Sashami combo again."}
{"text":"I rather enjoy Watami, the ingredients are quite fresh. I particularly enjoy their rolls, as they have many varieties. I can't remember all of them, but I believe the Watami roll, the summer roll, and green spider roll are all very delicious. The sizes are pretty big as well.  This place also offers $1 special items for every $50 you spend, which isn't hard when you go as a big group.  I went once for lunch and they also have pretty reasonably priced lunch bento boxes.  All in all, I would go back to enjoy different kinds of sushi."}
