{"text":"Super delicious, reasonably priced and great service. Definite must-have in the neighbourhood and for pho lovers"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, usually when I am looking for a meal on the run or something quick to eat.   There are a couple of other Vietnamese and pan-Asian places nearby but the clear advantage of Ben Thanh is that it is much less expensive. That said, the food is pretty simple but above average. The place is clean and the couple who run it are very lovely and welcoming. You can also bring your own wine. If you're looking for a fine dining experience, this may not be your spot, but for decent food at a great price, this hits the spot."}
{"text":"It pains me to give such a low review to what is clearly a family-run restaurant but it's just not good. Especially considering that the excellent Pho Tay Ho is a 10min walk away from here. Beef soup broth had an inescapable sweetness to it. Chicken with vermicelli had near no chicken and it was saut√©ed with onions instead of grilled. Rolls were good. Vietnamese iced coffee was good. But the \"meat and potatoes\" were not. And they gave me one of those awful King's fortune cookies at the end of the meal which is wrong because: 1) they are the worst fortune cookies which have permeated the montreal restaurant scene and 2) this is a Vietnamese restaurant not a Chinese one. Sigh."}
{"text":"Great service, nice smiles, listened to hotel California three times. Food was tasty but portions were really small. But! Open Tuesday! So sorta worth a walk. Acab."}
