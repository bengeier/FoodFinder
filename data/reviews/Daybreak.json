{"text":"Really great place.  Wonderful and friendly service.  Cup was always full.  Prices were very reasonable.  I went with the \"big breakfast\" and I was not disappointed.  Pancakes were like heaven!"}
{"text":"My favoite spot in town for a quick & delicious meal. Friendly staff. Almost always busy but have never waited in line. Cheap & Cheerful!  The breakfast special with 3 eggs poached and bacon, but substitute the homefries for real fries.  The chicken club is awesome and the peameal on a kaiser is as good as the St. Lawrence mkt downtown, (must add mustard)!  Coffee's always fresh an full flavored.  Fresh fruit bowls are a nice side.   Have seen many a youngster enjoy the blueberry waffles with whip cream, or the whip cream topped hot chocolate's.  Don't forget a generous tip if it hits the spot.  On the otherhand if you like waiting in line, slow service, and paying twice as much, try Cora's, its just around the corner."}
{"text":"Happy to have stumbled upon this place on yelp. A little bit of wait and slow for service, but understandable as it's Sunday morning and the place is packed. Food delivered quickly and very tasty home fries. Smiling faces and bubbly loud environment. Come patient and hungry."}
{"text":"My first choice for local breakfast outside of my own kitchen. Friendly staff, 2 tvs to view Breakfast Television, perfect BLTs with homefries, and they keep the coffee coming.   I always seem to get lucky and walk right in and snap up one of the half dozen booths. Comfy seating, quick service and a full tummy. Can't be beat."}
{"text":"Such a great find, next to mary browns this is a gem, we went at 2 pm and the place was still serving breakfast, I had the hungry man, great ! Service was fast and attentive, food was cook perfect, this is our spot from now on"}
{"text":"Great, Great, Great! Went on a Friday morning with a few friends. Service was really quick, waitress was super nice and easy to talk to. Food came really quick, and was super tasty, I got the pancakes with bacon and homefries, everything tasted amazing, just if you like your bacon soft be sure to tell them when ordering your food because they make it really crispy .Washrooms are super nice and were really clean. Definetly my go-to from now on."}
{"text":"Friendly old-fashioned service combined with quickly prepared food in a clean but utilitarian atmosphere makes for a good but no frills breakfast experience.   Our table for two was too small for our plates of eggs, sides of toast and coffee.  But the server  worked carefully around us and soothed our early morning blues with frequent refills of coffee.  Eggs were nicely prepared and home fries were crisp and not overly greasy.  Obviously  a hangout for regulars who banter back and forth with the staff.  Try and sit at one of the popular tables for four."}
{"text":"We decided to check out this fairly new restaurant. You walk in and seat yourself. There was no signage to let us know, but we weren't standing in the doorway long before someone greeted us and told us to sit wherever we'd like.  Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. The dining room was very clean and picked up well.  The only negative was the wait time for our food. We waited a little longer than we'd like to for our breakfast combos, and they did not give us our French toast (we requested to substitute French toast for pancakes). We did, however, come in at a time when the dining room was full and for a fairly new restaurant the wait time was understandable. Our waiter checked in with us regularly, filled our coffees and apologized for the wait and mistake in our order.   The food was delicious!!   Overall, 4 stars for this brunch experience! Love the friendly vibe and feel of this place. Looking forward to coming back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Don't really know what I was expecting when I came. The chicken in the omelette was dry, the omelette was unseasoned and my eggs over medium was basically over easy. But I do really like the sausage links here, I mean all breakfast sausages are good, right???"}
{"text":"Food is not bad, okay prices. One of the waitresses with the black hair is extremely rude if you are a student. For no reason at all and this is the reason I barley go here only on occasion."}
{"text":"I visit their Mulock location every Tuesday for lunch.  The food is good and our server is so nice and friendly! She remembers us and remembers what we order. She's helpful and does her best to get everyone their food on time (which can be challenging with the lunchtime rush!)  I only wish they had a website I could email to ask about soy content. I'm intolerant and I keep having reactions whenever I eat there (I don't know if the potatoes are done in soy oil or something).  Our server did her best to check the ingredients on everything, but I know that some corporate offices don't make this information available (see Mary Brown's), so there's only so much she can do.  Still, I'd recommend this place! It's great good, greater service, and a decent amount of seating."}
{"text":"First visit to Daybreak today for breakfast. First thing I noticed about the place since the new owners took over was the cleanliness and bright atmosphere. Customer service was spot on. All the ladies were super friendly and attentive. Food was absolutely awesome. Hats off to the cook. Hot and delicious food plus a great value for the prices charged. Can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"I usually go to first watch but decided to try this place which is closer to where we live . I think they are very reasonably priced, food is good and staff is friendly-not as fancy as firstwatch but nonetheless pretty good for the price.  The outside is an old Taco Bell but inside the decor is relaxing. I like that his place is in the community that needs a nice place like this to give it a boost. I hope they thrive and grow because I really like when small business provide quality services in the community. I will be coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I have been here more than a few times and always enjoy the experience.  Servers are competent & friendly, the chef is consistent & skilled.  Even on their off day, their product is above par.  Eggs Benny is delicious. Omelettes are great.  All in all, great value, excellent service. I will return."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict is great. Make sure you stipulate how you want you eggs done or they will be over cooked. Service is awesome  from a couple of the more seasoned wait staff, but have had a couple of experiences that were really bad. This is the best breakfast in Newmarket.  We live in Barrie and still look for an excuse to come here."}
{"text":"Now here's a situation where there may be some haters for what I actually always get from here. I started getting eggs Benedict from daybreak almost every time, I love the Hollandaise sauce they use. And this is where people may get the hate... I know FULL well that they do not make this themselves, it comes in like a carton that they pour into coffee mug and heat up in the microwave. Most people this this is a sin of sins , but what if IT TASTES GOOD ANYWAYS, seriously I could care less about how a place looks if the food tastes good, or care less about the methods they choose to prepare something. so TAKE tHAT HATERS!! Lol, I'm in a caps lock mode.   For real though, just get some of this sauce dumped on a order of homefries and tell me it dosnt taste good, I promise that 80% or more people will be super stoked that they listen to me, the other 20% maybe it's just not the type of Hollandaise flavor that you personally prefer. Mmmm just writing about this makes me want to get some right now but being on a stupid diet .... Grrrrr its just temptation... Yummy temptation.... Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Just consistently good breakfasts, but in this location, even better service.  The servers were a bit overwhelmed dealing with a Labor Day crowd, but they caught mistakes and rectified them quickly, while I just watched. Took all the stress out of breakfast at a busy restaurant.  I have been here a few times.  I just can't really find any faults.  If they only made real hollandaise instead of the mix, this would have no reason to not be at 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"We were greeted immediately upon our entrance. The waitress said to please sit wherever we would like and one of them will be right with us. Which sure enough - as soon as we sat down we were asked if we would like coffees. So coffees and menus arrived right away. We were given an appropriate time to select our menu choices and turned over our menu and the waitress came right over. She offered other choices since I was not eating home fries. The Fresh fruit added was just the right touch.   The place was packed and therefore knew it was a good place but the proof was in the pudding. The immediate service, the quality of the food and the politeness of the waitresses was beyond amazing!!!   We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Loved this! Really cute building, seat yourself, and we were served very fast by attentive staff. Food was amazing. I got the omelette and it was great, prices are not bad at all for the quality and amount of food you are getting. Definitely a great breakfast spot to try."}
{"text":"We were quite north of Toronto running some errands and got a little hungry while waiting for one of the places to open. That is when we decided to go for breakfast. We didn't want to spend the kind of money that Coras charges, and we didn't want the standard Golden Griddle either. My companion knew about a smaller breakfast place, so we headed over.  When we first walked in we were greated with the biggest smile I have seen that early in the morning. The server and host and everything but cook, Steve, was very happy and pleasant. He was one of the funniest and helpful staff I have had in a restaurant in a long time. Aside from just taking our orders, he was recommending things based on what we wanted so that we got more for less.  The menu had a cool look to it with the shape it was cut, and it was well organized. It mirrored the large menu that was on the wall. Also on the wall were extra deals and specials, including a daily breakfast at basically half what it would be on the regular menu. The prices were extremely fair and slightly lower than I am used to paying for breakfast.   The food was really good as well. I got the pancakes which were extremely fluffy and really good. The biggest upset was just regular syrup instead of a maple option, but that is just personal preference. The person I was with got the breakfast special which consisted of eggs, bacon, home fries and rye bread, all for $3.99! She ordered her eggs scrambled and well done, and the bacon well done as well. I am always a fan of well done bacon, most places just can't get it right though. The bacon she was served was so crispy that it made me happy just looking at it, perfect. The home fries were also extremely good and well spiced (based on the few that I stole from her plate).  Daybreak is a great place if you are that far north and looking for a good, cheap breakfast and a laugh or two!"}
{"text":"I usually found most daybreak restaurants to be kind of run down, but I was pleasantly surprised with this location. Service is good, food is your average breakfast food, prices are on the cheap side. Overall it is a great place to go if you're looking for a good breakfast, but you won't find those fancy brunches here."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and food was good for my first visit.  Please add turkey products to your awesome menu.  Will update my post accordingly."}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast place.  Can't beat the Eggs Benny.  Clean, fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Before this place was daybreak it was Susie's.  Susie's had good food but they where seriously lacking in customer service, to the point that I'm sure that's the reason it's closed. As for daybreak it seems to have a similar menu, at least for breakfast.  Also when I walked someone took my order and greeted me at the door. I was so happy about that I forgot what I wanted to order.  Also they removed the chairs that where in the front. I think this was a good idea cause that was part of the reason the service was bad before.  All I got was some pancakes, eggs and bacons. Everything was delicious but the pancakes were kinda meh.  But I loved the service so much that I will definitely be getting something different next time. My only issue was that it closes at 3.  This area doesn't seem like a good place for breakfast and lunch spot. So I guess we will see how that goes, i hope the best for this place. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I have to start this review by saying that it's not as presentable as the other two Daybreaks in Newmarket. But, as we've all been taught, don't judge a book by its cover.   The breakfast fare is decent. You can get plenty of breakfast and lunch items including omelettes, sandwiches, burgers, fresh fruit, bagels, pancakes, french toast, eggs/toast/bacon/sausage/ham, etc. All priced relatively well and taste just the same. I don't have much to rave about but do find myself coming back here whether it be a rough morning or a requirement to start my day right. They have early bird specials too.   Bill for two people usually rounds to $20, which includes bottomless coffee."}
{"text":"Always great food and amazing service. The nicest people work here and they always get your food to you as quick as possible. On top of that you will never leave hungry. At great prices there is no reason to have an empty stomach. The free wifi is great too!"}
{"text":"Its THAT breakfast spot in Newmarket... always full, quick and easy breakfast. Get your food, relax and start your day. The staff are friendly, make you feel comfortable and the food is great. Breakfast is great. I go here every week. Would definately reccommend this breakfast joint."}
{"text":"This is what you expect in a breakfast place; clean, lots of seating, CP24 playing on two TVs, fast service, friendly service, waters, coffees filled up WITHOUT asking, good size portions, good price, great food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast we are coming from Toronto and stop for a quick breakfast good service and good food and super sweet server Rachel thank you for serving us"}
{"text":"I went here on my lunch break because I kept hearing all of my customers rave how good it was. As soon as I walked through the door I was greeted and told to sit wherever I liked. I immediately noticed the difference in décor from the previous restaurant that was there. The old one looked kind of run down but no more. The restaurant is bright and cheery and tastefully decorated. Over a brief look at the menu I decided on the chicken sandwich with marinara sauce. My food was brought out very quickly and was very delicious. My server was absolutely delightful as well. She was so sweet and very attentive. I feel like I haven't had service like that in a while and it was a refreshing change. I will be back to try some of the breakfast items on my way to work."}
{"text":"Out of all the breakfast options we have between King/Aurora and Newmarket - this is my favourite place. Daybreak is the best bang for your buck and the food without a doubt always exceeds expectations. Homefries (I guess hashbrowns in this case) are always a piece of perfection - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Nothing like the home fries from a few other unnamed restaurants, which for whatever reason, always end up tasting raw/undercooked. The waffles are fluffy and not overly sweet, which is ideal for someone like me who can't really handle anything overly sweet - bacon is crispy, eggs are always cooked exactly as asked. Service is great, although when it's busy in here it can be a bit of a challenge trying to get a coffee refill. If you want to eat somewhere cheap and leave completely satiated - Daybreak is your place."}
{"text":"Clean, great prices & warm & friendly staff.  Definitely my go to breakfast place in Newmarket when I want something quick."}
