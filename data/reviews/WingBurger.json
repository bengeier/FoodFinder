{"text":"i love this place. their burgers are amazing not the prettiest but taste great. I'm impressed by there wings and many different flavors. sriracha buffalo is one of my favs. 5/5 for me! definitely worth the try"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Their wings are amazing. Big portions and decent prices. The staff are friendly and quick."}
{"text":"This is mainly a carry out but has a few counter seats.  We had the combo which consisted of three wings any style and a burger with a good amount of toppings.  My dry rub cajun and we're very good along with a burger with all the toppings and fries.  You get a free drink with combo.  The burger was good and tasty and not messy even with all the toppings.  The fries seemed like natural cut fries and were very good.  The place is clean and staff extremely friendly.  If we're ever in the Toronto area in the future we'll definitely make another stop here....."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of restaurant options in my neighbourhood, but I have to say that for burgers, fries or fried chicken, this place is reliable. The burgers are consistently good. The single patty one is easier to manage than the double patty since they are pretty thick. The fried chicken is juicy and the coating is tasty. They have regular fries and sweet potato fries which are always good.

There are fish and chips here too. You'll likely want an extra piece of fish if you order that, since the single piece is a bit small.

I eat here way too much.

The restaurant has very few seats, so you might have to take it to go during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"This review is only for the burger as I haven't tried anything else on the menu yet. We ordered take out.
The burger was tasty, lean and fresh! I tried a few fries and they were good too, but I'm not much of a fries person. I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu, or I may just stick with the burger. One of the best I've had in years."}
{"text":"Poutine was so good, simple but not salty (which is a common problem) burger and all the toppings were fresh and delicious! 

Overall very filling, I would compare it to Five Guys just not as expensive!"}
{"text":"I had the burger with a poutine, it was amazing. I also got a vanilla Milkshake - amazing. Had a very full/sore belly after but it was worth it. I'm so excited they deliver! Can't wait to try the wings."}
{"text":"Issue with the just eat website had my burger from this place delivered with absolutely nothing on it. Despite clicking to add bacon and cheese and an egg. While I do understand that third party websites can cause these issues with ordering..there is a right and a wrong way to deal with a paying customer. When I brought up my issue, Instead of an applogy or an offering of a possible solution I was told it's not their problem and was asked \"well, what do you want me me to do about?\" I said I'd pay the difference to have it corrected so we could enjoy but apparently pleasing the guest due to an error that wasn't my fault either, isn't important to them.  I hung up. You just lost a customer due to piss poor service on the phone..and your food could use a little work as it is."}
{"text":"Rating of course, is only based on tonight's meal which was Fish and Chips. 

I know some places freeze their filets to cut down on time, but really though, this place isn't exactly the busiest that they need to do that. At least the times I've gone, it wasn't busy at all with just 2 other customers at most. Regardless, the amount of time you have to wait for your food, you might as well make your fish fresh as in battered and fried upon ordering. 

Now, what happens when you re-fry filets? They get overcooked. And when they're overcooked, they're tough to chew on. Although the filets were nice and meaty and the batter wasn't too thick, the fish was like chewing a pretty medium-well steak. 

To be very honest, the fish didn't taste all that bad. The tartar sauce that came with it was a little on the runnier side and was also quite bland. What I also found surprising was the fact that they didn't have any malt vinegar. Malt vinegar, not white vinegar, is key for fish and chips.  Also, the coleslaw that came with it was rather gross. It had a very fishy taste to it. I immediately threw it out after just one taste. 

The fish itself I'd give 3/5. With their special price on Wednesdays and Fridays, I'd give it another shot. 

For the coleslaw, I'd give it 1/5. 1 for it being included in the combo, but nothing else."}
{"text":"I'm one of those people who appreciates a good combo meal. If I'm making my own food, I like for their to be a variety on the plate, and so in restaurants, the ability to try a little of a few different things, but not have to pay to buy them separately means a lot to me. 
I've been to Wingburger a couple of dozen times now, so it's no longer about trying things out: but the WingBurgerFry combo is still my go to order, as it gets me 3 of my favourite things, plus a drink, all for a damned good price. 
The burger is a tasty, juicy, and well put together affair.  I like that the default toppings include real shredded cheddar cheese (even though I often go without, but I do appreciate that it's there if I want it), and it's consistently been perfectly done for me. 
I also really like the wings. They're always a good size, and there are always a number of sauces to choose from. The choices pretty much stay the same, but you can also mix and match anything on the board to make your own take on the flavours!
The fries are just that. Fries. But pretty good ones in my book; and he's not stingy with them. 
There aren't a lot of places to sit (just some stools and counters), but I've never been without seating if I want it, and it appears as though he does a lot of takeout business here. 
The owner/chef is a friendly, laid back, nice guy. He makes you feel welcome, and always gives everyone some attention, even if he's busy cooking. There are other helpers here and there as well, and all seem friendly and competent. I also like that I can phone my order in, and it'll be ready for me when I get there.  
I'm already looking forward to me next visit!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a whim. Definitely don't regret my choice. We ordered a pound of wings and the works fries (hamburger meat, gravy, onions and peas). First off the wings were a hefty order at 9 pieces for $11.49. And they were pretty big. Got the scorpion hot flavour and it was a good kick. The fries were really good. Super crispy and golden and the toppings were excellent. The owner is super chill and is doing honest work and making honest food. Don't hesitate and get some food here."}
{"text":"Honestly the best burgers and chicken wings in the area! Their hand made burgers are massive and beyond tasty. Their chicken wings are big and yummy. Their prices are good considering they serve you burgers the size of your head. I love that you can go to their website and place an order, then your food will be waiting for you 30 minutes later. The staff here is soooooo nice! I give them a golden star for customer service!!"}
{"text":"Food is really good, but service is the worst.

If you're ordering from the Four Winds location near York you can FORGET ordering for delivery, they just make rules up as they go because suddenly apparently you can't order combo prices for delivery. 

Racked up nearly a 45.00 bill for what should have been 3 combos, which is absolutely ridiculous. Reason being is because default orders over 20.00 get free delivery. Ordered delivery from them before and it was never an issue, but yeah, apparently it is now so I wouldn't recommend anyone ordering from them anymore if that's a new rule."}
{"text":"I'd heard of the place and the name always seemed a little funny to me. 'Wingburger' all in one word sounds like some weird literal burger made of hot wings. Alas, it's more 'wings, burgers and fried chicken on the cheap', but I'm not sure the best way to brand that.

The friendly worker at the front suggested going with a burger when I was debating what to get. It's all made fresh and apparently the meat isn't frozen. I also went with fries, which are fresh cut and made to order. You can also get any of their wing sauces on the burger. Turns out Sriracha BBQ sauce was really good on it! The burger was delicious, on a nice quality bun on toppings I picked. The fries were shoestring and great too. The pop's included when you get burger and fries, so the whole bill was just $9.

Great burger and fries, and surpass many places which charge a few bucks more for the same thing. If there was any doubt in awarding a 5, the value helps push it over the top."}
{"text":"Wherever I go, I look for hidden gems. This is definitely one of them.  The burgers are real and juicy, The buns are fresh, the fries are made from real potatoes. The chicken wings are delicious as well. Oh and the milkshakes are made with actual ice cream. If it's a burger and fries and/or chicken wings you're looming for, forget the chains and eat here."}
{"text":"Great food! I had an order of medium flavored wings with French fries. The portions are huge! Great value. I would definitely order from this restaurant again using uber eats."}
{"text":"Last time I drop by they were recently just opened so I cut them down a bit in rating due to service.

I was here on Sunday (late review, I know)  The service is more friendly, timely and quick. No beefs there anymore and the food is still amazing. This location live  up to it's hype. 

The location is still not in best spot, still think they need work on signs to indicate where they are, Thou maybe they did advertise to the university or people living in area. The cook tells me that they get alot of students and business seem good which is great."}
{"text":"Despite the rain storm we had, I drop by this place, Wings and burgers sounded like a great idea to me. 


My order contained a chocolate Milkshake, a double burger which half a pound, double patty burger. And five jumbo wings.

I Will start with what I didn't like and that was the wings, I went with a poutine style wings and honestly the toppings was the best pair, makes me what to try their poutine. The chicken itself really lacked favour or any taste. It was chicken but it was taste less,   I probably stick to burgers or try to fried chicken but im on the fence about that.

Also, for the claim to be jumbo, they were nothing more then average size. so that another think I got knock them down for.

On to the main course, the double patty, double burger, this was a half pound (8 0z)burger, that's a standard size for me. The patty was juicy and tasty, I could eat another one. The only thing that made less enjoyable was the lettuce but that can be fixed by no lettuce next time.

I hear they're sauce are suppose to be good, maybe I got try one of their sauce favour on my burger.

The last part of my meal was the shake.  Hard to mess up a chocolate shake and they didn't. it had nice, rich cremy taste to it, so good. It wasn't lumpy or anything. Probably going to have another the next time.  Someone esle also order a shake because mine looked so good. If that isnt a sign then I don't know what is

Wings- 2/5- poutine sauce saved it a bit, 

Burger- 4/5- lettuce,  

Chocolate shake-  5/6, this was the real star and hidden gem.


The cooks, and the lady behind the cash were friendy, good service, seem to be known with locals, and have a few regulars based on my observation and based on ,my experience, I don't see why anyone wont want keep going there"}
{"text":"If I'm in the area here @ Don Mills and Eglinton then I'd swing by for their hamburger anytime. The owner here used to run Big Al's Diner over at Keele and Steele's area before it had shut down. If you had visited Big Al's and loved it as much as I did when I was schooling at the York campus then Wingburger will definitely hit close to home."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 out of 5.......

I have been to WingBurger a few times and their food has always been good. Food is consistent in quality and the staff is always friendly!

Today we got their WingBurger Fry Combo ($11.49) and 1/2 lb fried chicken ($5.99)

WingBurger Fry combo - we chose Habanero BBQ as the sauce. Sauce was not spicy, and the price is a bit on the pricier side, but over-all the food was good. Burger was a good size. Most of the customers that came today ordered the WingBurger Fry combo.

1/2 lb Fried Chicken - took about 20 minutes to make, the chicken was not greasy at all, it was crispy, inside was tender and really JUICY. I found it a little bit salty, but my BF didn't so we kinda had mixed feelings on the salty taste, but the chicken was really healthy and you can really see that the owner picked the best quality chicken cuts as the chicken breasts were a good size, and there was almost no bone in the chicken.. 

Their milkshake is soooooo good, this is one of the items I really enjoyed in my visit today..

CONS - long wait on food, and this place could get really busy. Also they are pricier than most fastfood places. Seving size is just okay.

{"text":"I ordered the wing burger fry combo which includes a 1/4 lb burger, generous order of fries, three wings and a soda. 
I wanted the scorpion sauce for the wings but they didn't have any so I got the Siracha Buffalo sauce.  Very tasty and not too hot (spicy). 
The burger was very good. The meat had a nice flavour and texture.   So much better than many of the so-called high end burger places. 
The fries were cooked perfectly with the right amount of crispness. 
The wings were decent sized. 
I would have loved to try the scorpion sauce though.  Maybe next time...
Seating is limited inside though.  
As I was eating I decided to order 5 pieces of fried chicken to go.  The chicken is awesome.  Lightly battered, cooked perfect and very juicy.  
One of the better fried chicken I've had.  
I would definitely go back again !!"}
{"text":"Finally a decent chicken wings place! Made to order so comes out hot with the skin crispy and the meat juicy and tender. You can sample the sauces and combine them as well, garlic Cajun combined with lemon pepper was a winner! Yummy fries. THE BEST sweet potato fries I have ever had, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The cashier/cook (she washed her hands before she made our order) said they coat them with cornstarch before they fry them.

WARNING: this place is NOT for anyone watching their weight or are on a diet restriction. The chicken and fries are deep fried and they don't hold back on the spices which includes salt."}
{"text":"Hot new business! Been seeing these guys unpack for a couple of weeks. They took over the old Middle-Eastern shawarma joint after it closed down. 

I am soooooo happy they are here :) I could smell them literally a mile away. Pure hot fried goodness pouring out of our little sketch mart mall! Awesome!

The staff are really friendly and seem excited to serve the community. They are offering a grand opening special right now - Buy a burger and a drink and you get free fries. Well, I wanted the bison burger but that thing is apparently huge and more expensive so I decided to go for \"The Works\" poutine. The cashier was super kind enough to offer me a free drink with my poutine and gave me an excellent deal. 

The works ($6.49 + tax) is made up of fresh french fries with hamburger, gravy, peas, & fried onion. The next best thing to getting the country style poutine @ Smoke's Poutinerie. I actually don't even see a reason to go downtown anymore...we have everything we need right here in this little town we call #YorkUVillage. 

The fries looked a bit of a mess but my mouth didn't care and my belly is super content with me right now. So content that I will likely go back soon to feed the monster again. 

Welcome to The Village, Wingburger! Keep up the good work please please please and don't go away and leave us!

--------------------------------------------------

Note: 1 star off because I was told their onion rings aren't available until Monday & they currently can't take debit. Some 'Vicinity' loyalty card thing is also in the works (they had a weird \"tap your card-ish device\") but it doesn't seem to be active yet, as well. Not a big deal but maybe some customer feedback will help them sort out a more efficient & smoother Point-of-Sale process."}
{"text":"Burger was moist and very flavourful! The side of fries are a massive portion.  Bun was ok, would have been better if it was more of a buttery soft type bun, but it was still good.  Definitely going back when I'm around the area.  Still need to try the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Burgers are great, fresh and delicious.   Wings are also great. I had the garlic dry rub and they were amazing... I would recommend this place and I will continue to keep going back."}
{"text":"Captian America is referred to as Winghead.
The Detriot Red Wings have the winged wheel.

Both of these are recognized as class acts in their respective areas.

Add Wingburger to that group.

A simplier, cleaner burger joint.  Not a lot of special named burgers, but everything fresh, freshly prepared and excellent.

The place is super clean and neat, almost obsessively so, and that's a very good thing, right?
Staff was great, prices really good.   Location pretty decent, minimal seating but that is about the only drawback to the place.

Went with the Bison burger combo.  Big, juicy, seasoned to perfection and just really fresh.  Topping were fresh and crisp, cheese was real!
Fries were thin cut which I am normally not a fan of.  They never seem to be cooked right, either semi raw or burnt...  Not these, these were fantastic."}
{"text":"I was in the area hungry, and looking for something to eat. I scavenged Yelp and came across this place, and based on the reviews I thought I would give it a shot. 

The place itself is very unassuming of the food they serve so don't let its \"humble appearance\" steer you away. I ordered a hamburger with fries and both were made to order; something I was pleased to see. The hamburger was very flavourful and probably one of the best hamburgers I have had in a long time. The fries were good too, but being honest they weren't that special; or to my tastes. 

Asides from burgers, this place specializes (as the name suggests) in wings too. They have a small selection of flavours but having tasted one (Habanero BBQ) they are pretty decent and unique. My experience was quite pleasurable and would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for a semi-quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered their burger/Poutine/chicken wings and onion rings.

Don't make the same mistake as I did:  the onion rings suck BIG time!  It was a waste of my $4.49!  It was hard and tasteless!  I thought I ordered fried pièces of tires.

The burger was ok.  The beef patty was an ok size.   Not very mémorable though.

The poutine at 5.49 was passable.  Choice Fish & Chips' poutine at $3 is better.

The chicken wings..... were édible.

Not a bad location:  pizza nova is just 2 doors down :)"}
{"text":"Everything here felt homemade; the burger was of great quality and well cooked. I had it with jalapeño mustard which was new to me but I'd have it again if ever I see it. Fries were well cooked an a portion of wings we got were had just the right amount of sauce for my tastes - not a big fan of a really wet wing. I had the scorpion sauce flavour which was hot enough without being scary.

Folks working there were friendly too which isn't always the case in burger joints I find.

Looking forward to trying their bison burger next time."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!? My 3 favorite guilty pleasures done right in one spot: juicy burgers, crispy fried chicken and chicken wings. Fresh, plentiful and affordable and the guy running the joint was cool. 
The burger was awesome fresh juicy N tasty, the wings were big with nice sauce options and the fried chicken was delish, more fresh home style than greasy colonel type, lightly seasoned with plenty of chicken flavour coming through. 
Don't be thrown by the good prices, portions are big and did I say delicious? Yeah I'll be back soon, to try the bison burger. 
Sorry local fast food joints and inferior burger options, from now on I will be eating here or down the way at California sandwiches. These guys just get me, I like awesome food with good value!!
Passed by many times noticing the funny name and so glad I looked them up. Ordered online off their website, it's a pretty nice tight system. Food was just getting bagged as I rolled in, and the cook was great to chat with, spirited even though they were a half hour from closing. Thanks Wingburger, I'll see you soon, and good luck! Bless"}
{"text":"We stopped by Wingburger for a quick lunch. The fried chicken was juicy and delicious. We had the choice of getting it sauced or seasoned, we opted for the latter & really enjoyed it. The fries were made fresh to order, and were good with a splash of malt vinegar. The owner was very friendly & personable. Great place for a quick bite if you're in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars I was craving burger today so I decided to try WingBurger. I've always wanted to try it coz I've always pass by it before but thought they only served chicken. I ordered 1/4lb burger with poutine and onion rings and 3 pieces of chicken. The patty was thick but a bit dry. Luckily I had a fried egg with everything else in it. But the poutine I would go back for. Lotta cheese and lotta gravy. First time in a long time I had poutine totally covered in gravy. My son loved the chicken. Onion rings were pretty regular."}
{"text":"Have you ever craved wings and a burger? Or how about fresh cut fries with a poutine option? If you answered yes to any of those questions then this is the place for you. The wings are nice and juicy and the burgers are done just as good.

Go for: freshly made food with good quality and a combo of wings, burgers, and poutine! 

Don't go for: a dine-in experience"}
{"text":"Oh my....the Fries here are amazing. They are fresh shoe string fries, and the gravy is to die for. Haven't had fries and gravy like this, well ever. And thats even from the great old Fresh French Fry trucks you typically see around cottage country.

The wings here were also good. Gotta try the Sriracha wings!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic local burger joint with FRESHLY made hamburgers and delicious fries. Everytime I go I think I'm going to try the chicken (which looks amazing) but I keep sticking to my faithful burgers. 
Yes, it takes longer than McDonald's, but the food is made to order and not sitting under a heat lamp. 
Owners are super cool!"}
