{"text":"this is not really a good butcher shop the chicken is scrawny and the meat does not always look the best be careful on the meat that you chose it is not the freshest looking meat. The only thing that i buy is chicken breast has a good price and the bacon. They do not always clean the cheese slicer so ask for it to be cleaned."}
{"text":"they make you buy the overdone roast beef that is left over before they will sell you the rare beef and if you complain they say \"dont come back\""}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the meat shop I grew up going to.  True butcher shop. Filet is $21.99 a pound which is pretty much the going rate.  Phenomenal quality filet...as in restaurant quality.  Other stuff sold there?  Spices, seasonings, deli meat, cheese, pasta.  I have been searching for a replacement steak rub, and dare I say I found a GREAT one here (Szged brand).  Yowza it is awesome.  The parking lot (I don't know if you can even call it a lot...it is more of a parking 'strip') is completely messed so I suggest you enter their parking strip with one hand on the wheel and one hand on the horn if you know what I mean..."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and needed to find a good meat market.  This place does not look like much on the outside, but inside it is filled with family owned pride and all kinds of great products, mostly leaning Italian.    The service is over the top great and the prices are incredible.  Their selection runs from sea food, chicken, pork, beef (to include beef ribs) and lamb.  They work with you and answer any and all of your questions.  A ream meat monger.  Very hard to find these days.  I almost felt like I was in an old tv show.  I bet if I go three more times they will know me by name."}
{"text":"This place still has that neighborhood Butcher shop feel. The staff is excellent with the service being over the top good. I had some special requests and the level of attention yet again was superb.   This is my first Yelp post and signed up just let people know. I have been going to this place for years and it seems to have gotten even better now with the newer owners."}
{"text":"Good products at fair prices. Meat is fresh and they are willing to provide what you need even if they have to cut it freshly."}
{"text":"What a difference an honest to goodness butcher makes! I cannot abide what Giant Eagle calls a steak or pork chops or really any of their meats. They haven't a clue how to butcher and I've had enough which made me finally go to Giovanni's. I should have done it a long, long time ago. I just assumed a butcher would be more expensive than a grocery store. Well first off what you're getting at Giovanni's Meats & Deli is such a supreme product compared to what Giant Eagle is passing off as meat in their meat department. Contrary to their commercials they don't care about the customer (big surprise there). Giovanni's on the other hand the moment you walk in you know you're home. Plus the pork chops I bought were actually less expensive than Giant Eagle's and looked like pork chops and didn't have a big bone right smack dab in the center of the chop. The rib eye steaks were flawless and so delicious. In fact they were so good I got up from the table and found myself writing this review. Thank you Giovanni's Meats & Deli for focusing on quality meat and exemplary customer care. I felt like I had gone back in time when being a customer actually meant something. It also didn't hurt that the young woman who helped me was super nice and super cute."}
{"text":"Best bacon burgers!!! I've read they have four different kinds of burgers and I can't wait to try them!"}
{"text":"I would like to edit my review of Giovanni's because I believe good customer service is essential, especially in the Information Age that we live in, where people are out of touch with each other and videos that are brash and insensitive in nature, go viral everyday. My initial review was that of a disgruntled customer but I'm pleased to change that to 5 stars because of the positive interaction that I had with one of the owners of this historic store, today.   Customer service can be a strong factor in maintaining a relationship with a customer or completely destroying that same relationship. I'm happy to report that my faith in humanity and my relationship with Giovanni's has been renewed. The concern and compassionate that I felt while telling my story made me feel like I was talking to an old friend whom I've known for years, which is one of the reasons I will continue to shop at Giovanni's. I appreciate that my first review didn't fall on blind eyes and it showed that the last experience I had in their store was not the norm and that it was unacceptable to them as well; I feel as though I matter as a customer. I don't think this review can express how much this interaction meant to me; it truly made my day.   Thank you for making it right and I look forward to continuing to patronize this business. They're a one-stop-shop and they really have every kind of meat you could ask for, including fish and their prices are extremely reasonable. I look forward to shopping here for many years to come and hope they remain close to home."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this butcher shop. Not only did they have incredible cuts of meat, they also have beans.   We were able to place an order for a large summer meat pack. We'll pick it up on Wednesday. It includes 3 types of cuts of steak, chicken, eggs, sausage and bacon. I'm talking large quantities of each for about $80. With the summer coming, it'll be nice to have a fully stocked freezer for the grille.  I was also able to pick up some lentils, for cheaper than I'd get them any place else.   We were also told with enough notice. They could deliver live crab for us. How cool is that? We're definitely looking forward to our crab cookoff this fall.   The shop was clean and the staff was super helpful!!"}
{"text":"Every town should have a great butcher shop. Lyndhurst has Giovanni's.   Small, family owned business with years of expertise. Friendly and knowledgeable service. Fair prices. Great selection. Fresh meat from a trustworthy source. I've been buying from Giovanni's ever since I moved to Lyndhurst (apx. 3 years ago) and will continue to patronize them for years to come."}
{"text":"It's great to have a real, and local butcher to get your meat from. This place will remind you how much you hate the grocery store. Skip the meat counter at Giant Eagle and hit up Giovanni's."}
{"text":"Ordered lamb shanks from this place; the quality is superb and the price is also very good.  It's easy to place an order by phone for pickup.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  I will definitely order from this shop instead of a grocery store in the future."}
{"text":"Great prices and selection, willing to custom cut what you need.  Have some cuts not seen very often.  Good selection of herbs and spices and dry pasta as well."}
{"text":"I've been going here all of my life and so has my family. Everybody is very friendly and caring and accommodating. It's the best place to go everyday but especially on the holidays."}
{"text":"I picked up my prime rib for Easter and it was delicious! Good price for a 7 lb 3 bone in rib. The guys in the deli were so friendly and were asking me how i was going to cook the prime rib and offered up some of their favorite recipes as well."}
{"text":"Recently moved to town and have been very unimpressed with the salami available at the local grocery store. Walked into this place looking for better salami and I found it! Not only did they have a few verity they also had hot sopressata which is great on sandwiches. They guy behind the counter was super helpful. Everything looked so good that I ended up walking out of there with like 4 types of deli meat."}
