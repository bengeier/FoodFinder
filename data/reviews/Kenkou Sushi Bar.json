{"text":"I really didn't like this place. We came here because of the high Yelp reviews but were quite disappointed. Food lacked color and taste. Everything was extremely oily and bland. Won't be returning here!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I wanted to have some \"catch-up girl\" time.  I suggested coffee, she suggested dinner.  I had seen and heard of Kenkou Sushi before since I live in the area, but I had never tried it out since it changed over from a Chinese restaurant.  Since I am on an odd diet of eliminating land animals from my diet for Lent, sushi seemed like the best way to go about getting a good meal.  The place seemed empty, with the exception of the staff and a few customers, but the hostess paid attention to us once the doors opened and we were treated like VIPs.  The staff were very attentive and were at our beck and call.  It would have been nice if they weren't circling our table every 5 minutes.  Not that it is a bad thing, as some places completely ignore you, but it is nice to have some time to yourself.  Of course, we went for AYCE, where the menu was your standard AYCE menu, with the exception of a few unfamiliar items, such as bacon mussels and sweet potato wrapped shrimp.  The food items came out pretty quickly and all at once, which was slightly overwhelming, but at least they give you the number of pieces that you order instead of leaving out one or two pieces.  The best part?  The salmon sushi.  Second runner up?  Surf clam sushi.  Everything else?  Meh.  Would I go here again?  Perhaps.  For $22.99 for dinner (on Friday - Sunday) with 10% off if you pay via cash, it's not too bad."}
{"text":"Good location and great food  The only problem my group and myself have is that sometimes the service is slow. One time we went for an 11:30 lunch and the orders took so long to come that we got 2 orders in 2 hours. Today was ok service but we had the waiter that my sister and her friend always joke she has a \"mild hatred for people who ask for things\" as apparently she gets crossed when asked for more water pr another menu. The hand rolls are great, the sushi is good, maki is creative but not stupidly complicated. I personally atay away from the rice and noodle dishes because I'm already eating a tonne of rice in my sushi and maki. Good place for lunch if you're near steeles and leslie"}
{"text":"The quality of their AYCE and service have gone drastically down.  While this place never had superb service, even basic courtesy is now non-existent. I found several pieces of hair in the salmon rolls and a small plastic piece in the rice.  When I told the server, she ignored me and just collected the empty plates on the table.  After getting her attention again, she said not to eat the pieces.  Even after putting the rice aside having been quite full, she comes back and said we can't leave any leftover rice. It was even more disgusting that the manager didn't care about any of my concerns.  This place will definitely not get a return visit from me and hopefully many others who read this."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times. Good prices for Japanese food, and pretty fresh for the price. They have AAA beef for the AYCE!   Love the eel rolls here, and the inari is a must try, but not for everyone.   Good location for parking, service can be a bit slow sometimes but is friendly and accommodating.   Better options for sushi, but for the price it's good! Will be back"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim and decided to stay since the lunch specials were decently priced (and there was a 10% off grand opening coupon).  Service-wise the staff still seem pretty new, they forgot to give us tea and I had to gently remind them, and when ringing up the bill they mis-charged us. The restaurant itself is nicely designed and very clean. Food was ok, nothing special.   Also, I took a look at the AYCE menu and there really wasn't anything special about it."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food and service is fast and delicious, I go here all the time. Tim is great by the way!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday and was given choice of ayce or a la carte at entrance. My party went with ayce voting quantity over quality. To my surprise sashimi and sushi were very fresh. Sashimi was generously sliced and good portion.   Price was 20.99 for a weekend dinner which is not too bad. The catch is that the menu was limited. Don't expect anything fancy.   One thing to watch for is that pop isn't included although the ayce menu said so. We were charged $1.50 for pop with refills when the bill came. Otherwise service was attentive. Tea was quickly refilled and plates were taken away when emptied."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! This place looks like a small takeout place from the outside, but their restaurant is actually quite big, very clean and nice.   The sushi was good, they had some interesting rolls and the menu was the average AYCE menu with a couple more great options. The Salmon was very very fresh which was wonderful.   We went on a late Wednesday night and it was very empty so the food came very quickly. The service was hard to understand. Meaning they didn't understand my English (I'm Canadian) and I didn't understand their English. So we tried to stay pretty basic with our ordering because we didn't want to get mistakes.  The price was much better than we had expected and they have a 10%off special. All in all I'd definitely go back and hope for a little bit better service but the food was great and it was a nice to try a new place!"}
{"text":"Seeing the positive reviews here really make me wonder if were going to the same resturant. Granted, Im here on a lunch buffet (yes present tense because Im still here, waiting for the bill to arrive) so I might not have had the best items the menu has to offer. The sushi is just terrible, no other way to put it. The rice was warm and moist?? Theres now a limit on the beef short ribs (3 per person) which was really the only redeeming item on the menu. It seems like the layer the golden shrimps with more and more fried coating every time I come here. (my friend keeps suggesting it) The menu selection vastly pales in comparison to every other sushi ayce Ive been to in toronto. Never coming here again if I could help it, giving it 2 stars because the staff was fairly fast and the price is dirt cheap but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was awesome! The photo attached didn't tell the full story, but it's a good enough representation. The food were prepared fresh, and since it's AYCE, the portion didn't really matter. Speed of service was on par, today it was a tad slow for lunch, but they are very attentive so it's all good."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night with my huge family -- we were 2 rows of tables, for 21 hungry people. Borderline hangry...  Orders are still placed by pencil & paper, and although they may be able to accommodate large groups in terms of seating, they are a little overwhelmed by trying to serve them.  Restaurant size: Spacious, yet the tables near the entrance will be somewhat poorly lit. Perhaps the elegant term is...ambient?  Portion size: What you order is what you get; sushi and sashimi orders are per piece. Maki rolls aren't completely full of rice!  Service: Back to the point about being overwhelmed...  For my immediate table, we decided to be a section of 4 people -- it's impossible to get an entire row of 16 to agree on food items, let alone pass them around! Some other family members did their own sectioning, and the service staff were OK with this. However, sushi and sashimi orders were sent to other tables (as in, other CUSTOMERS), and some order sheets were conveniently misplaced. This resulted in one group sitting without food for around 30 minutes. There is a 2 hour time limit. Hangriness takes over, and an argument between a family member and the staff ensues...  While we were all waiting for our food, the service staff, including the cooks, decide to do stuff with their garbage bins and start doing some cleaning. We're not sick, so I guess nothing to really be worried about -- they totally washed their hands after, right? Right!  They do have children's booster seats available if needed.  Food quality: Quality was quite acceptable. Sashimi wasn't too thick, wasn't too frozen, wasn't too thin. Maki wasn't too full of rice. Some really delicious dishes, like bacon & asparagus and grilled salmon belly.  Final thoughts: You get your money's worth here, but if you're coming with a large group you may have to exercise your patience.   Also, you'll get a bicep workout with their heavy washroom doors ;-)"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch around 11:30 on a Saturday. There were only a few other tables occupied when we came, but it was getting full as we left. We were sitting at one of the side booths with the rounded padded seats. It looked more comfortable than it was, but overall the decor was nice.  We had the AYCE menu, and it was pretty much average for an AYCE place. It seemed like the sushi rolls came with lots of rice, but the maki rolls less so. We enjoyed the \"Alaska Roll\"; it had thin rice paper instead of rice. Cooked items were generally good, including the beef short ribs. The pork cutlet was quite small but it's AYCE so you can always order another.  The waitresses were all very pleasant and we got almost everything we ordered. They forgot to bring the golden shrimp, but we didn't realize until after we'd paid so it was too late to reorder. Everyone on YELP seems to recommend that particular dish so we'll try it again when we return.  Overall we were quite satisfied and would go back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"This has to be my favourite AYCE sushi place in Toronto (and i have tried a lot!!) Dinner menu is great and it comes with sashimi. Sashimi is always so fresh! Great service, great appetizers and great rolls. Everyone has their own take on what the best sushi restaurant is but if you want some all around good fresh sushi, nice environment and great sushi, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Came on Sunday lunch for all you can eat. Very satisfied with the quality of food and service. Their hand rolls are really good. Not like typical ayce sushi stuffed with rice and small portion of fish.  Salmon belly was mouth watering.  Would definitely come back again.  Good value of money."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch buffet. I used to come here often for great food before I had to move, and today I felt like coming back for a great meal. To my disappointment, the deep-fried food in general were greasy and didn't taste as good as before. I think the oil wasn't fresh. Also the hand rolls and sushi pieces had a lot of rice in them. Now, I understand it's AYCE so they do this, but this time I could hardly enjoy the fish meat because of the sheer amount of rice that came with it. I got full so quickly and didn't feel very happy about how I got full. The servers were friendly and attentive, the food came in promptly, and empty dishes cleared as soon as they appeared. However the food wasn't great - I almost felt sick and lost my appetite all day long. With the money I paid, I could've gone anywhere else and got decent, filling meal without the aftertaste of too much oil and rice. The food themselves are 2-star, and I am only bumping up a star because of the clean interior and great service. I am not coming back for AYCE."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant yesterday for lunch.   FOOD - TYPICAL AYCE (ALLYOUCANEAT) FARE   Service - Fantastic service ( I left something at the restaurant and the waitress ran outside to give it back to me)  TIP - BRING CASH = 10% discount  Now people who eat AYCE a lot won't find this place worth travelling from downtown to eat here. But for people in the area it's pretty adequate. Tucked away in a plaza, I almost missed it.   Beautiful looking, the tables were clean and not greasy. Servers were helpful and never missed an order. Food orders were prompt.   Food both kitchen items and sushi were good. But typical, as most AYCE serve the same type of food.  The items which were the most memorable or unique would be the Osaka Shrimp. Which has been mentioned by a fellow yelper. I also liked the Beef teriyaki it was tender and seasoned well (Medium-Medium/rare) The salmon sushi was fresh and not slimey tasting. They also this Sushi made out of rice paper which was pretty good and unique. (Alaska roll ?)  The tentsuyu (tempura dipping sauce) needed my salt in my opinion.  The surf clam sushi was very thin, 2g of surf clam with 15g of rice. (I brought a scale to calorie count)   I would go back again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing price of 18.99 for all you can eat, and you can get an extra 10% discount if you pay in cash!  Food is delicious, both raw and cooked varieties. My friends and I have reordered the short ribs many many times. The one con is that the rice tastes underseasoned.  Service is very polite :)"}
{"text":"I've   been here twice and I just love this place.  Of course we never got our order immediately because the restaurant is always full and people can't serve everyone at the same time but the food is excellent. it's worth to wait. I am happy I found a good sushi place where i can enjoy my favorite food either with friends or family. Highly recommend everyone to go there."}
{"text":"i have been to this place a few times now, and loved the food every time. they have a nice selection of dinner items. the sushi is fresh and delicious. i will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I first thought this place is a small sushi take-out place, but it turns out to be a nice restaurant.  On a Sunday evening when we got struck out from another AYCE place, this place is plan B. the place was pretty quite, with only 25% of tables filled with different types of customer. (Families with young children / baby who would like to have their nice Sunday dinner, to a bunch of teenager who looks like they are just came out of a hunger strike)  The servers seems to be all Chinese, but they all speaks english in a gentle voice. I guess because of the neighborhood are with less Chinese speaking asian, so unless the customer speaks Chinese, they would use English when they approach the customers. (+1 stars)  They offer a la carte or All You Can Eat, as we wanted AYCE, we decided to go with AYCE and will come back if their food is good.(+1 stars)  The food was pretty good, and because they show how many piece in one order, you just order 1 if you just want to try something for the first time. Like the \"cooked tuna sushi\", I guess it's for someone who doesn't like to eat raw fish? ;) (+1 stars to the menu option)  The place is nice restaurant rather than a fast paced AYCE who just want to kick you out, place looks really clean, services was on point (didn't miss anything I ordered), and they accept credit card! (+1 stars)  A nice place for AYCE, will come back on a different day (may be lunch) again."}
{"text":"$18.99 for all you can eat (AYCE) on a weekday is not bad, especially when you get 10% off when you pay in cash.  The food is good, not outstanding, but slightly above the usual AYCE quality.  -- Rolls aren't padded with rice to make you full -- Sashimi is good -- Tempura and other fried food are prepared well too, especially the two types of shrimp they have (shrimp tempura and Osaka golden shrimp) -- Pork cutlets are super thin so they tend to be on the drier side -- Salmon is great, but the belly is my favourite -- Calamari? Not the fried kind. It wasn't great. -- Beef tataki has always been a miss for me, either warm or sliced too thick.   Service is economical and efficient. They're good with refilling tea if they see it, but otherwise, there isn't much interaction to judge.   During our most recent visit, they missed a few orders entirely, which hasn't happened before. But they're pretty good with giving you what you ordered unlike those other AYCE places that decide you'll only get half the quantity of sashimi you ordered."}
{"text":"I usually don't go for all you can eat sushi but after years of eating terrible sushi in Italy I have grown accustomed to buffet style servings.   This place was surprisingly great. The portions were small, which allowed us to try a larger variety of dishes, the fish fresh, and the service quick and friendly. The rice was well cooked and didn't leave me feeling like a bloated rice ball. A great deal for the price, especially at lunch. Lots of space for groups. The ambiance is bright and pretty quiet. Hot dishes are also available on the all you can eat menu as are desserts and non alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"The service was rude. The server kept coming back to question us on whether we were going to finish all the food we ordered. It made our party feel threatened. The food was mediocre and the rice fell apart."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, but the food was good. Sashimi was good, the fried golden shrimp was good but a little oily for my taste. For being an AYCE place,  definitely recommend. Btw, no refills for pop. Accepts credit cards and tips are not included in the bill."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the entrance. This place is quite spacey. Great for groups. $20.99 for AYCE dinner. 10% off if you pay ca$h.  My favorite items here are sashimi (all of them!) And short ribs. Place was not very crowded so service was quick and efficient. Oh ya and they got chocolate ice cream.  Overall nice place for AYCE dinner."}
{"text":"I have been to many AYCE Japanese restaurants, and Kenkou Sushi Bar probably has to be in my top 3 AYCE restaurants. The sushi, maki, and sashimi were up to my standards, just absolutely immaculate to high standards. Their ramen is very hearty and warm, thanks to their rich and tasty broth. They have a lot of good options that I still wanted to try but I was not able to due to the fact that I had too much of their amazing Shrimp tempura (made to order).  Honestly, if you are looking for a reasonable AYCE place to eat at reasonable prices for lunch/dinner, I strongly recommend this place to all my fellow AYCE diners."}
{"text":"Kankou Sushi is my favourite sushi bars in our local neighbourhood in North York. The staff are always friendly and the take out fast.  Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a reliable place to eat."}
{"text":"2 stars overall.  1 start for service and the somewhat sneaky tactics to get you to fill up on tempura batter.  The food was a 3 star for an \"it's okay\".  As a party of 8 people, we ordered variety of dishes.  Salmon sashimi, fried scallops, beef sashimi, shrimp and vegetable tempura, etc...  One thing we noticed was that the salmon sashimi order came last...something we thought was odd since we expected it to come first because no cooking was required.  Another thing we noticed was that we only had 20 pieces of sashimi when we ordered 40 pieces.  The salmon sashimi was good, just that it came much later than all the rest of the dishes.  Another thing we noticed was that they gave us extra of other dishes that can easily fill you up.  They also doubled our tempura dishes.  For the tempura, we ended up stripping the tempura batter and eating just the vegetables and shrimp so that we had a bit of room for some more sashimi.  We ended up with a heaping bowl of batter...  Conclusion: We felt that we were victims of a sneaky tactic of filling us with fried tempura food so that we wouldn't have room for the good stuff (salmon sashimi).  The lesson learned here is to order ONLY the salmon sashimi in the first round of order.  That way they will need to serve the sashimi.  We went on a Saturday night at 7pm.  One would expect the place to be busy but it wasn't.  In fact, we were the largest party to dine there during that time and the place wasn't busy.  We have a pretty good idea why...like for other dissatisfied customers, Kenkou's service left a bad taste in our mouths and we don't plan to go there anymore."}
{"text":"I've been to my fair share of all you can eat Sushi restaurants and this one by far had the worst service. The staff was friendly and accommodating but when business gets busy, the kitchen starts to get busy which is a bit annoying.. we had ordered 2 rounds of food and both times an order of grilled eggplants still have not come even after asking about it 3 separate times.. I was getting extremely frustrated just sitting and waiting especially with empty glasses waiting for refills. The least they could do is give us the tea pot of green tea or a pitcher of coke..meanwhile a smaller party behind us received a pitcher of coke and we didn't.   Besides service, the food was okay..nothing to go crazy about..one thing I thought was strange was that they didn't have green dragon rolls on the ayce menu..but on the regular a la carte menu.. Meanwhile every other ayce Sushi place I've been to had it..   The atmosphere was great...modern decor. And it didn't get extremely busy because there were always open tables..but because they're new, i'm guessing they just have to learn with the larger number of guests in the restaurant.."}
{"text":"I just ate here today. Food was great until the owner came and offered to clear the table. We said yes as we thought it was a sign for us to leave. The owner than said next time you come you should finish this (2/3 eaten fried rice). I was not happy about the service as it felt rushed and inconsiderate. There will be no next time!"}
{"text":"Went back with my wife, and it still is a 3 stars. Just does not quite get to 4 star level. This would be a better place for lunch at a lower price. It does not compete well with Maison Du Japon."}
{"text":"This place is not worth. I went here for lunch with some friends and it was $13.99 a person. Considering the price, we weren't expecting much but even for the price, the food did not meet any standard (not even my really really low standard). First, they were soooo slow. Literally sat there for an hour before the food came. Secondly, they put a limit on the short ribs (3 per person PER MEAL). Usually it's a limit per order to make sure you don't waste food but literally 3 a meal is absurd. Also, we ordered it 3 times and finally when we asked why the ribs weren't coming THEN they told us about the limit so we waited for nothing.   There was a younger female server who was really nice. Other than her, the older servers were rude and tense. We got out \"fill\" on edamame and bean sprouts and skewered shrimps (pretty yummy BUT NOT WORTH FOR ANYTHING ELSE)."}
{"text":"While craving sushi I needed to resort to using my YELP mobile app to find a good AYCE sushi place.  On steeles in between Bayview and Leslie right at Steeles and Lauraleaf is Kenkou.  Though this is an aging plaza, Kenkou looks small from the exterior, however don't be fooled .  Its quite big inside!! The first thing I liked about this place was the fact that it's clean, contemporary, efficient.  The service was top notch, and the menu selection was reasonable as was their weekday price $18.99.   Their variety of  sashimi was fresh: salmon, butter fish, white fish, etc. Hand Rolls were perfectly packed & well proportioned...(50% rice/ingredients).   The vegetable Tempuras were lightly dressed with panko..perfect balance of batter. Presentation skills was perfect!  The overall place is great, and I will definitely be adding this to my list of go-to sushi places in North York (northern part of North York that is) I would highly recommend their Spicy sushi handroll, tempura sushi, and mango sushi...  I will see you soon Kenkou you've got a solid 4.5/5 in my books!!..."}
{"text":"Kenkou is a small AYCE sushi spot near Steeles and Bayview. Though I said small, it actually is rather large when you walk in. The place is clean and reminds me a lot of Sushi Kiku. The lunch menu is $13.99 and I found myself a bit disappointed by the options.  The sushi was decent enough. The salmon and surf clam sushi were pretty good and I found the rolls to be pretty decent as well. The spicy crab roll and the hand rolls were done very well and they definitely have more meat than rice in this place. The hot foods like udon and skewers were subpar. Smaller portions (which is OK for AYCE), but quality wasn't there either.  Most of my AYCE favorites like seaweed salad and shrimp sushi can only be found for dinner, which is disappointing. The place is OK but being that its the same price as almost every AYCE sushi spot, there is nothing to really differentiate this place from others."}
{"text":"Appetizers were really good (especially the spicy fish soup). Sushi and sashimi were horrible. The restaurants ambience is nice. Overall, I probably won't return since there are many other Japanese restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about. Nice, small restaurant with attentive staff. Not hungry enough to spring for AYCE but portions were fairly big. Price point reasonable. Didn't find anything unique on their menu that would have me returning anytime soon (somewhat out of the way for me).  All food is well-prepared and presented in an appealing manner. If you live in the area and feel like sushi this would be a place to check out."}
{"text":"Can't beat the 12.99 Mon - Sun lunch price. Came here for Saturday lunch and was pretty much the first people there. The service was slow initially but picked up. Fish wasn't really super fresh, which is disappointing.  Good food: beef short ribs, deep fried calamari Beware: the noodles and rice have gigantic portions That 10% off cash payment thing was never mentioned to us, since we only got to see the AYCE menu."}
{"text":"My favourite go-to ayce sushi! FRESH, not stingy with the slices of fish, doesn't try to kill you with loads of rice. They have many things here that you have to try: Osaka golden shrimp (tempura shrimp with yam string wrapping around it), deep fried soft shell crab, anything with butterfish in it, etc. The old favourites (e.g. Teriyaki, beef short ribs, unagi sushi) are excellent!"}
{"text":"Kenkou sushi bar...........I was there last thurday to dig on some sushi and sashimi..........  The place was clean and tidy.. also I noticed it was a slow night so perfect location for just me. ^^  I opted to take AYCE and pleasantly suprised to see how well each items were cooked or made.....   1st, I saw other fellow yelpers recommanding golden shrimp so I tried couple of them - they were covered and fried with thinly cut potatoes.  personally I believe they tasted better than regular tempura shrimp. Not too thick yet created wonderfulflavor with right amount of salt. I was satisfied.  Sashimi - I was having some mackarels and  butter fishes. they were really fresh. did not leave any bad after - taste or strange odor which I could smell from rotting fishes. I'd refilled them couple times. Good job guys!     Shrimp Skewers -  WOw, whole shimp on the stick!!!! do I need to say more? Just simple salt and peppers on the top ! ( I was suspecting some trace of msg .. but it's AYCE.)   Beef tataki - did not even know they supposed to come with the soy - vinegar based sauce on the top!  aged very well (Of course not as good as other 4~5 star restaurants but...) and and I did not have to rush to the washroom when I got home!! ^^  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Will I go back to this restaurant again? Of course!!!  Will I be able to recommand this to others? Yes.  Just be carreful with  rolls like others stated, then you wo'nt have any problem."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. huge portions, good selection for all u can eat, some diff n interesting items on their all you can eat menu which is worth trying, great lunch specials that will STUFF you! Only try it if you can eat like me :P  Clean, casual trendy environment, very fresh food, service was fine not that busy during lunch time."}
{"text":"3.5  Kenkou is a nice little spot located in a small plaza on Steeles.  Thanks to Yelp for helping find this place.  Pros: Lots to choose from in AYCE menu Service is quick even when busy  Cons: No Tuna in AYCE Ice cream not divided?  We were felling AYCE sushi one weekend night and didn't want to travel to far.  A quick search on Yelp revealed this place.  I go by this plaza all the time and never knew there was a sushi restaurant here at all.  It's looks very tiny on the outside but is actually very big when you come in.  This place also lets you order a la cart so if you're not feeling AYCE, you have that option as well.  One look at the AYCE menu shows Kenkou offers a lot of options.  They have your sushi, sashimi, some fried foods, teppenyaki options, udon and a bunch more I can't remember off the top of my head.  One notable omission is tuna.  They don't seem to have that on the AYCE menu which kinda sucks.  Other than that, I was quite satisfied with what was available.  The service here is very quick and friendly.  We didn't have to wait long for any items we ordered.  The sushi here is pretty good, not the best but great for what you're paying.  I loved the teppenyaki items.  The garlic shrimp was definitely one of my favorite items. The sashimi was well done as well.  The sushi and anything else with rice comes with a lot of rice (which is standard at any AYCE place if you ask me) so I avoid those when I can.    When it came to the ice cream at the end of the meal, they did something strange.  We ordered 3 orders of chocolate and 2 orders of ginger ice cream.  I was thinking we were getting separate little bowls for each order like all other places.  They out all 3 orders of chocolate in the same bowl and all the ginger in another.  I don't know if they did that because they knew we were family, but it was still awkward to eat.  I can't imagine if I came out with acquaintances that I'm not as close to. Just weird if you ask me.  Overall, a nice little place to go for sushi.  It's a hidden gem if you ask me.  It won't be the best, but will definitely satisfy."}
{"text":"2.5 - Based on the food alone.  Deep fried/tempura items were completely tasteless.  Shrimp were previously frozen which I expect, but they weren't seasoned and neither was the batter.  Service was fine, tea was refilled in a timely matter.  Empty dishes were eventually taken away.  Although English wasn't very polished, they answered our questions about certain items - not correctly, but they were answered.  ;)  (Btw, I'm not super picky about servers not being able to speak English 'cause I almost expect them NOT to in certain ethnic restaurants.  What's important to me is that they *try* to answer questions and don't look bothered by them.)  Nice interior, but the chairs are waaay too low for the height of the tables.  Not super comfortable.  To be honest, food wasn't anything special.  There seemed to be a lot of options, especially for dinner, but as soon as I tasted that most of the non-sushi items were bland, I didn't bother ordering a second round.  Sushi itself was tasteless and unremarkable in terms of presentation.  Hence the no pics.   DISCOUNT:  10% off if you pay with cash, but REMIND them.  And if it's your bday, you hafta have 6 people in your party before the bday boy/girl gets to dine free!"}
{"text":"Friendly sushi restaurant, large selection for all you can eat, fantastic sashimi, great service, the rolls had little amount of fish in them though."}
{"text":"Great quiet atmosphere unlike most AYCE places where it's literally a fish market. This establishment is an AYCE place where you can actually have a conversation with your party so you're not matching decibel levels with the next table.  The food is fresh and fast!  I Def love the mushroom pork roll which is essentially enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon...  Mhmmmm  Ps. Free WiFi!  HELL YEAH"}
{"text":"Price is low, but the quality of the food is also quite low. I would give the overall quality of the food a 3/5 based on the expected standard of AYCE.  The tea smelled like bleach. When I told the waitress \"this tea smells like bleach,\" she responded \"oh, it's probably the cups.\"  That should give you an idea of the restaurant. :("}
{"text":"The quality is not very consistent, sometimes the sashimi is very fresh and melts in your mouth and other times the fish meat is not firm... Probably if they are not busy.  There are so many different varieties of snack eats, my favourite being the Kalbi beef short rib, Osaka fried shrimp, and all the tempura. Other good ones are the salmon belly and skewers. Although when you are eating all you can eat, by the end everything tastes the same. The rolls are no good, not intricate at all (FYI, cucumber and mango and rice does not really go together).   The decor is very nice and the owners are friendly. It's not a bad place if you want AYCE."}
{"text":"Nice decor and ambience.  Fast service and friendly staff!  Good location and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"sushi and sashimi was decent, but soft shell crab is a lieeeeeeeeeeee.... overall not that impressed, there was very few tables yet they somehow still managed to confuse our orders.  I will give em credit for having better than average decor AND seating. But haha, it's a AYCE."}
{"text":"\"Kenkou\"? Sez you!  I'm sad that Joanne Kates has retired from her column at the Globe and Mail. Next to Rose Reisman, she's been a favourite sly target in my reviews.   She probably doesn't know that I exist.   I didn't even go to her summer camp as a kid, but her reviews informed my own approach to silly amateurish food writing.   At her best she was brilliantly descriptive.   At her worst, she relied too heavily on a few standard tropes: the presumptive superiority of French cuisine; the newbie's appreciation for Asian exoticism; the liberal douching of over-the-top sexual metaphors for food.   I have had some great meals. Apparently, they stimilate different pleasure centres of my brain than Ms. Kates'.   I read her farewell column with bemusement, until she commented on he difficulty that comes with finding new ways to describe sushi. \"Aha\", I thought. \"So we are on the same page\". I have reviewed my share of sushi joints, with more to come; but they tend to pile up in my \"complete your review folder\". It's raw fish-hopefully fresh; rice; seaweed; and occasionally fun deep-fried stuff.   Kenkou offers all of these, in varying degrees of execution. It's all fine; designed to be consumed in mass quantities, soyou don't really consider how any one piece tastes.   All-You-Can Eat sushi is eating, not dining; a robotic process that places filling your belly ahead of savoring each dish. I eat. I taste umami-bomb miso and allegedly spicy ramen. Hot, lightly filled gyoza and cool fish on cool rice. I rely on soy-wasabi sludge for a flavour punch. I don't get sick. That's good enough for me.   The sole item worth singling out are the Golden Shrimp; tempura shrimp wrapped in sweet potato strings before deep-frying. They alone are enough.   Ms. Kates now writes for the Post City chain of papers, from the wilds of Thornhill.   I've already added their website to my favourites list."}
{"text":"Overall it was decent. The hand rolls was filled with a lot of rice and it was so hard to eat a few of them."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday AYCE dinner. There's also an option of à-la-carte. Service stayed consistent over the course of the meal even when things got busier. The menu is the standard AYCE fare, nothing special. The price is cheaper than other competitors and the menu items definitely show why that is. The decor is clean and trendy with lots of green. The booth seats were very comfortable. The place looks smaller than it actually is from the outside.  They were not stingy with the slices of sashimi, a big positive in my book. However, the quality was only about average and the beef sashimi wasn't very good. The handrolls were pretty well-made. Maki rolls were all right. I tried the Osaka golden shrimp and it felt like I was eating chips with shrimp underneath. Not bad at all! The tempura was average but had a good variety. For the grilled mackerel, I expected to get the whole fish like other places, but it was only a small piece. The miso soup was not delicious.The tofu seafood soup had very little tofu in it with a very shrimpy taste so take caution before ordering. In general, the hot food is better than the raw food. Try the fried banana for dessert! It's different than the ones I've had at other places because it's not completely fried (batter looks a lot like tempura). Pop/soda is an extra $1.75.  Taking the lower price into consideration and the 10% discount if paid in cash, I give Kenkou Sushi Bar a solid 4. I wasn't super impressed with any of the food but it was more than acceptable for me to come back."}
{"text":"Good food, nice service. Great price can't complain! But I over ordered so most of the sushi at the end tasted like mushy :/ the beginning was nice"}
