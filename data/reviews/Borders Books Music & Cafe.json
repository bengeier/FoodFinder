{"text":"In a surprise move, I think this Borders actually wins when placed in such close proximity to the Barnes and Noble (also in Crocker Park--why?).  I do usually choose B&N, but I think I liked the Borders experience better in this location. Firstly, it's a little bit easier to approach/find parking for than the B&N (when coming from 90, it's a quick right on Detroit, then left into the parking lot, as opposed to weaving in and out of Crocker Park \"streets\"). It's right next to the movie theater and Spoon Me, two of the main reasons I have to visit Crocker Park (the other being Liquid Planet, but I think Spoon Me trumps that one as well).  Also, I like the layout of this Borders. They have a nice kids' section and a much larger parenting/education section than the Barnes and Noble (yes, I suppose since I'm a mom now, I have to take these things into consideration).   Checkout took exactly 30 seconds.  I'm not entirely sold on Seattle's Best Coffee yet, but it's not a dealbreaker. I will definitely give this Borders more traffic in the future."}
{"text":"I have been shopping there lots of times. I like the coupon promotions. It makes you want to shop at Borders more often."}
{"text":"Rip-off the man!  THE UP-SIDE:  Books, CD's (for those without iPods!) and lot's of cards and stuff.  This place is pretty clean, efficient and friendly.  Best of all, they have a coffee shop in house where you can read all the books without paying for them!    THE DOWN-SIDE:  Like a big, dumb, lumbering corporate dinosaur, this place has the nerve to still charge for the wireless internet.  WTF?!  You gotta be kidding me!  (If you're a smarty-smartster like me, you'll just grab the FREE wi-fi signal that wafts through from neighboring Bruegger's Bagels across the way!  Me loves to rip-off the man.)  In addition, this place attempts to push their \"Borders Rewards Cards\" with every purchase.  This isn't such a big deal, as most employees here will accept it when you say you don't want one.  However, there is one absolutely annoying Borders drone that works in the coffee shop area.  He will annoy you to no end, practically force-feeding the benefits down your throat.  I've told him I don't want one, that I visit the store every week, and that he has asked me over 10 times so far.  I told him, \"Please remember me and never ask again.\"  He refused and said he will always ask.  He just doesn't care that he is annoying me and will basically always do so.  Great customer service there.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  Go here for a good selection of books and to rip-off the free wi-fi from a neighboring business.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Good bye my dear friend. Life will be less without your pleasant staff, discounted cook books, magazine selections, and your welcoming in-and-outdoor seating. I dread Books-a-Million filling your shelves with family appropriate stock and all the bibles and inspirational propaganda. You are the true one in a million."}
{"text":"This Borders is a great spot to grab a table and get some work done.  Free wifi, tasty snacks and drinks (including a peach smoothie which was extremely yummy) make it easy for you to spend hours here without even realizing it.  The facility was clean (including the restrooms - I checked the girls' and my hubby checked the guys'), and the staff was friendly!  On top of that with this Borders being in the heart of Crocker Park, there are tons of restaurants, stores, etc. just footsteps away from you.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I remember long ago when The Promenade of Westlake was built, bringing Borders and several other great tenants along with it. Seriously, that feels like ages ago...and despite all of that time, this place still is goin' strong. I was afraid that the arrival of Barnes and Noble 50 feet or so away from here would kill off Borders, but as of now, Borders is still alive and well. Maybe it's because the prices are cheaper? Finding a good deal at Barnes and Noble happens occurs just as often as passenger pigeon sightings...whereas Borders typically has some type of deal running, and if you're a Borders Rewards member, you can nearly ALWAYS find a discount coupon either via the web or their emails...and if you aren't able to find one, wait a few minutes and one will probably appear in your email! =) (I don't see why anyone wouldn't want to be in Borders Rewards, considering that it's FREE to join...but hey, the money that isn't being saved on discounts goes into the economy, which seems like a good thing these days, right?)  Also, their coffee shop offers cheap refills, which is nice for the days when you're relaxing with a big stack of the latest magazines..."}
