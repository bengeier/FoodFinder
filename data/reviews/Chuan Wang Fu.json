{"text":"Probably the best Chinese food in the greater Charlotte area. I haven't been to Lee's yet in Fort Mill, but this place has been the most impressive so far. We were confused because when we sat down we were only given menus for Umai's Sushi. So, we apologized to our waitress to let her know we were in the wrong restaurant, and were leaving. She asked us what restaurant and we showed her this Yelp page. She said we were in the right place and then went to grab a different menu. That was a little weird and presumptuous to not offer us the Chinese menu. I noticed a white guy came in later and wanted to do take out, and they gave him the Umai Sushi menu only, and he said he did not want that menu either.  Anyway, we had the spicy shrimp which was fried and served with lots of dried chili and had a bit of a lemon grassy flavor. It was pretty good, my partner wanted some type of sauce on it but I didn't find it necessary. (I will say, I noticed some of the shrimp was not cleaned of the digestive tract, which is lazy on behalf of the kitchen. Another review commented on this as well) Aside from that, get this dish. Large shrimp and big portion, enough to feed four.  The soup dumplings aka Xiao Long Bao were not bad but seemed a bit smaller than usual, and we were not given proper utensils to eat with it (a miso spoon). Still worth ordering, because Xiao Long Bao is hard to come by in Charlotte, y'all.  My partner insisted we get beef lo mein which I'm tired of. The beef lo mein here is NOT good. I've had better beef lo mein from a mall food court. Sorry if that's rude, just being honey. It was pretty tired and dry.  The white rice here is good and not overly dry.  We ordered the dried fried green beans with preserved vegetable and pork. FUCKING GET THIS! It's so good, and was an awesome vegetable selection. I'm trying to make this for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner.   Kung Pao chicken pieces were smaller than anticipated but it was your typical fair with a bit more of a sweetness than I was expecting, but that's America for y'all.   The portions here are big and the price is reasonable. There were some hits and some misses, but compared to all the other Chinese options around, this place is the best. You will find a mix of authentic and American-Chinese, also American style sushi if ya want."}
{"text":"This is hands-down the BEST Sichuan food I've had in the United States, and is wonderfully authentic.  One of my college roommates was from Sichuan and loved to cook (bless her); I always struggled to find that type of cuisine in a restaurant.  Chuan Wang Fu nailed it.  We just had dinner with friends, and all of us were very impressed.  Although the restaurant was busy, we were seated right away.  Though, as other reviewers have mentioned, Chuan Wang Fu is in a transitional period, so they automatically assumed we were there for Umai Sushi.  Make sure you ask for the Chinese menu!  We ordered several dishes to share, and all were excellent.  The whole table's favorite was the Cumin Lamb, followed by the Dry Fried Green Beans with Pork and Preserved Vegetables.  I could live off just those two dishes for weeks.  The Dry Pot Beef wasn't quite as spicy, but was a very savory medley of beef, mushrooms, and vegetables served in a pot over a small burner.  We also enjoyed the Spicy Beef Tendon, which was pleasantly chewy and very hot.  In short, Charlotte FINALLY has a good authentic Chinese restaurant!  This has been my main gripe with the city ever since I moved here.  Guess I better find something else to complain about because (I really really hope) Chuan Wang Fu is here to stay."}
{"text":"We went for the Sichuan food and were not disappointed. My only regret is that we didn't have a larger party so that we could try more dishes. The dry fried green beans were excellent, with the signature numbing spice. The ma po tofu was also very good, as were the leek dumplings. I can't wait to come back and try more. They seemed a little short staffed at the time we went but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love the food!!!! Finally get to eat some real  Chinese food in America. The fish is amazing, and the ppl are really nice. Don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start this off by saying it took a year and a half to find good Chinese in Charlotte. I was raised in Cleveland Ohio where we have a terrific Asia Town and have been looking for a sichuan restaurant here forever! This place was amazing!!! Just as good as back home! The Beef in Hot Chili Oil was just the right amount of spice, flavor, and the portion was huge! The Cumin Lamb was seasoned perfectly and cooked just right. The garlic string beans were soooooooo tender and deliciously garlicky. I am just excited about my next stop soon! Going to try the dumplings, the Fish in Hot Chili Oil, and some sort of spicy chicken dish!! If you love spicy and want to feed your soul try Chuan Wang Fu! Leaves you feeling amazing due to all the spiciness and full as well!! Cannot recommend this place enough I am just thrilled to find this joint!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the exact same place as Umai Sushi.   I want to go ahead and say that I am sharing this with you fellow yelpers purely out of love. Believe me, I really want to keep this place a secret for just my husband and I. There is a secret Sezshaun Chinese menu that you ask for (you will initially he handed a sushi menu)....just ask the waiter/waitress for the Chinese menu. You won't regret it!  I do not like Chinese American food. Fortunately this is not Chinese American. You will not find beef and broccoli or General Tsaos on this menu (a good thing in my opinion). This place serves legit Chinese food on their secret menu.   We ordered the beef in chili oil, Zhao Lang Bao (soup dumplings), and green beans fried in some animal fat with spices. Enough food for 4. It is family style. Come with alot of people to try more. The soup dumplings were good. However the green beans and beef stole the show. The green beans were insanely flavorful! The beef in chili sauce was so so so good. Very spicy but a spicy that makes you wanna just eat more and more. Plan on getting some beers to help with the spice! Everything was just fantastic and actually verging on real Chinese food (per my husband who has lived in China).  I cannot wait to return just to try more off their Chinese menu!"}
{"text":"Chuan Wang Fu has taken over ownership of the Umai Japanese restaurant. They haven't replaced the signs yet, but if you approach the door you will see a handwritten chalk board with the Chuan Wang Fu name and specials listed!  My husband and I visited this location on a Sunday evening around 4pm with a group of Mandarin speaking friends who claimed this was the talk of the Chinese community for authentic Szechuan cuisine. We did family style, ordering several dishes to share and we feasted on spicy squid, saut√©ed eggplant in soy sauce, chicken with scallions, green beans, spicy beef with peppers, steamed snow pea leaves and a couple other Chinese dishes that no one knew how what to call in English.  The authenticity of the food was verified by the happily fed Chinese people with us and so if authentic Szechuan Chinese food is what you are seeking, look not further! The only other verified restaurant in the area is Lee's cafe in Fort Mill."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Szcheuan dishes.  Be prepared for an explosion of taste, spiciness, and satisfaction.  Very good service."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Chinese food restaurant in Charlotte right now! I love love love spicy Sichuan dishes and their hidden menu provides!  When they seat you, they give you standard menu, but if your feeling adventurous and dig spicy cuisine, ask for the real menu honey!  I've had many items that have all been delish, but these are my favs:  Couples Delight-this is a mixture of beef tendon and tripe covered in hot oil and topped with garlic and cilantro. I must get this each time. Can't go without it. It's served a bit chilled and is a great start to a Sichuan meal. It's not crazy spicy, but it might catch you in the back of your throat if your not careful.  Cumin Lamb-holy flavor. I try my darnedness not to get this EVERY time I go but the flavooorrrrsss! Yummyyyyyyy! I had this dish just a few days ago and discovered that they added a super authentic ingredient that was not there before. They added Sichuan peppercorn oil! Sichuan peppercorns give this numbing/tingly feeling which is amazing.   My friend ordered the Singapore Mei Fun and didn't even offer me a taste, so it must have been slamming! She texted me the next day and said her left overs were even better for lunch....uh ha.  Do yourself a favor and check this spot out."}
{"text":"I was here for sushi lunch a few weeks ago and had a decent meal. I came back and everything I wanted on the sushi was not available. So I made a snap decision for basil beef. I looked around the restaurant and There were lots of exciting looking dishes at other tables. I am from San Francisco and vey adventures when it comes to Asian cuisine. My plate showed up as a bla dish. No spice, when it had a pepper listed next to it. I was super confused how mine tuned out so lack luster. I pulled up yelp to find out there are two menus. I can only assume they decide which menu to give you when you walk in. I will give them another chance and next time I will be returning to ask for the \"other\" menu."}
{"text":"First things first, authentic Chinese food is almost impossible to find in the Charlotte area. Make sure to ask for the Sichuan menu. The flavors are authentic and spot on. Not as great as some places you can find in Atlanta, San Fran, or NYC, but this is great for the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Hmm... overall was ok and worth another shot.  The atmosphere is nice, clean and simple. The service was typical Asian customer service not rude and not overly friendly or attentive.  The soup dumpling had a thick and some what doughy skin and the filling was bland. The black vinegar and ginger sauce was good and complimented nice. The chewy skin is enough for me NOT to order this again.   The Spicy Chicken with Chili (or Spicy Chili Chicken) is one of my favorite Szechuan dishes. This dish here had a nice chili spice but lack the Chinese peppercorns which add the numbing tingling sensation to this dish. Again, this was tasty but also know that most bites have small pieces of chicken bones. So while eating this dish you will be picking and pulling small chicken bone fragments our of your mouth. Just fyi... this fact may add or detract from this dish, it really depends on you.  The salt and pepper tofu was decent that is a crust was crispy and toppings were complimentary. The tofu was not a good quality tofu, It wasn't poor or bad quality just very clumpy and soggy.   The Sizzling Beef on a hot plate was not sizzling, in temperate or taste. This tasted like \"beef in brown sauce\" that you can get from any food court Chinese place.   Now, I will try this place again, I want to try their Fish in Hot Oil and Beef in Hot Oil... but I will keep going to Lee's Cafe though...."}
{"text":"We didn't like it and here's why.  First of all, the gave us a menu that didn't have the items we specifically went there for.  It was a 'for Americans' menu.  I didn't realize this until after we ordered and saw some things pass us by that were not on the menu that we got.  After inquiring about those items that we saw pass us, they informed us that those items were on a different menu.  LOL you must be joking.  At least let us know there's an entirely different menu.  Next, the items that we had did not sit well with us.  Both of us didn't feel well later, or the next day (unforgivable!).  Lastly, the appetizer I asked for was pork steamed buns (the waitress said they had them).  But they brought us 5-6 small pork **dumplings** NOT buns, and note I emphasize the word 'small', they were tiny.  And for these small dumplings we were charged $10. If it wasn't for the pleasant waitress I would have given one star.  Definitely will not be going back, sorry."}
{"text":"The food here is decent but both times I went I was overcharged.  I am unhappy at that they took a mandatory gratuity and then took our cash and somehow thought the overage was an extra tip without evening bringing back change."}
{"text":"This is an awful place to visit. They have more than twenty tables and only two serving staff! We waited for half an hour and not a single dish is ready. Avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"Most authentic Chinese I've eaten in Charlotte. Ordered green beans, eggplant and beef in chili oil for 2 adults. All delicious! Enough leftovers for meals the next day. Make sure to order a side of rice for saucy dishes. Wine list is better than most Chinese restaurants. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying this place confuses me. I came here a while back to Umai's Sushi for their lunch and found it to be just OK. We came back to try the Chinese menu after some intense yelp research courtesy of my wife trying to find more authentic Chinese food. There is still a dance involved apparently as when we were given the initial menus they were for Umai and not this place. There is no question when you have the correct menu as it is covered in Chinese characters.  I had more doubts about this place when we started ordering the food. There seemed to be a general sense of confusion with our waiter and a complete lack of urgency. I looked at my wife several times with skeptical eyes as I was unsure of what we had gotten ourselves into.  Then the food arrived, wiping any doubt I had about the meal. We ordered the beef in chili oil, Zhau Lang Bau (soup dumplings) and dried green beans with preserved vegetables and pork. Holy crap this meal was delicious. The beef had an awesome flavor with an enjoyable level of heat. The clear winner was the green beans. Yes, a veggie. Don't ask why, just get it and thank me now. By far my favorite Chinese food I've had in the city, even despite the odd facade. I'll definaltey plan on coming back and trying more of their expansive menu."}
{"text":"Note to self: take your time working through the Szechuan menu on subsequent visits.  There's a lot going on here, and you may have to dig for it.   As my Yelp pal Elizabeth M. discovered, \"There is a secret . . . Chinese menu that you ask for (you will initially he handed a sushi menu)....just ask the waiter/waitress . . . You won't regret it.\"  Amen, sister.  We, like Asha B., started with the Couples Delight which is a chilled, spicy mixture of beef, tendon and other stuff topped with cilantro. Think like all the interesting things you add to a bowl of beef pho and you'll get it.  Pow.  What a start.  If you don't like spice, avoid.  The dried green bean entree we sampled is a meal all to itself.  So damn good.  So . . . we ordered some of this, and some of that until we cried Uncle and loaded up the rest for home.   I recognize this place is not for the uninformed or unadventerous.  One poor soul Yelped, \"The Chinese food, which you have to ask to order from, is weird. Lots of \"stomachs\", \"intestines\" and duck \"blood\" entrees, and a vegetable called \"rape\" (not kidding).\"  Bless her heart.  No General Tsao here.  For us it was a culinary trip down memory lane from our time in China.  In the mood for different stuff served in a more traditional Szechuan style, language barriers and all?  Way up on my \"Give 'em a whirl\" meter.  Enjoy.  Xiexie."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese food in Charlotte, service not great but food was great. I went there for Mothers Day for dinner, it was one of the best dinners I had for a long time for Chinese. The Garlic eggplant, mapo tofu & chicken fried rice was delicious. Sushi we ordered was not so great. Next time we will bring more people so we can share some different things& see if we can try different things on menu. I hope they stay consistent with there dishes. Hopefully I will try different things soon, also to have better service. Glad you guys open. Also glad they give dishes we can share with people & give us a great big bowl of rice. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Try the Dandan Noodle and it was spicy. Much more spicy than Super G Mary's beef noodle. I would highly recommend going there if you really want your spicy Szechuan fix."}
{"text":"WOO HOO! Ask for the Sichuan menu. Everything is excellent. The eggplant is sweet & spicy & vibrant. The lamb is tender with crisp veggies. Fish in chili oil is not messing around.  Service is super fast. We are so lucky to finally have authentic Szechuan in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. If you are Chinese this place will not disappoint. The fish in hot oil is up there with top notch restaurants I've eaten in in China. The xiao long bao was on point. The waitress was helpful and very friendly. I knew it was the real thing when the menu had multiple misspellings and  Engrish words that made no sense. The location is a little confusing to find as they didn't bother changing the sign of the previous owner and just wrote the name of the restaurant on a white board outside. The only other legit place in Charlotte is Lee's Cafe, but I would have to say that this place is better for the price and taste."}
{"text":"I have been going to this sushi place since it was Umai. The sushi was always great. Today, under new management the sushi was terrible. Rolls were small with little rice and no taste and the nigiri was small and no taste. It also looked like the group behind the counter were young teenagers and clueless how to handle customers. They just lost an original customer from the Umai days. Stay away bad sushi. Very sad as I loved Umai."}
{"text":"If you order the all you can eat sushi they stalk you so you don't waste or share.  Almost seems like they are out to get you. It was very uncomfortable and not appreciated."}
{"text":"This place has a great service staff, but the sushi isn't so great. Ru Sans is much better. Also, I once saw the expo / bartender / cashier clipping his nails behind the sushi counter. YUCK"}
{"text":"Best food, or Chinese food for non-Chinese people, in Charlotte. Order off the Chinese menu, super tasty.  If you aren't super adventurous, try ordering the following items...  Cold dishes: Marinated Beef Shank Mala Beef Tendon Dan Dan Noodles  Hot Dishes: Sizzling Fish Filet Cumin Lamb Beef in Hot Chili Oil Shredded Pork w. Garlic Sauce Beef with Pepper  Blow your mind good."}
{"text":"Every dish looks delicious?but they are not. As a Chinese, it's really not a taste of hometown. My friend recommended this restaurant to me, but I was disappointed. I understand that charlotte doesn't have many Chinese restaurants. This one is not too bad. But I won't come again."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. They offer all-you-can-eat sushi for $16 but I went for the Xaiolong Bao soup dumplings. They were tasty but a bit small and the skins were kind of thick. You must ask for the Sichuan menu to get to the good stuff. I tried the Mapo Tofu and that was very good, albeit not hot enough for me but it did have some tang from the peppercorns. Will go back to try other dishes including Chilli Beef or fish and the Cumin Lamb. There was an awful lot of yelling and bickering between the staff but generally it was a clean, nice place. Saw numerous tables with children so it must be kid friendly. Give them a try."}
{"text":"We ordered dan dan noodle, fish in chili oil, cumin lamb, green bean. I would say all of those dishes are not bad, but not amazing also. The fish is definitely better than lee cafe's since it is spicy as it should be. I won't recommend dan dan noodle.  Overall,I like this restaurant better than lee cafe."}
{"text":"The most authentic Chinese food I've ever had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"So I took the advice of those here and asked for the Sichuan menu. I had a large hot sake at the bar (reasonable $9) during lunch hour and everyone was very nice and attentive. Admittedly I didn't know much about the food and asked for advice. They recommended I try a more traditional dish for Americans, the kung pao chicken as I wanted something on the spicy side. She informed me it would be less sweet than the American interpretation and although I leaned more to the fried rice, she recommended the white rice instead. Sure, I knew I wouldn't be pushing many boundaries today but I was also too hungry to take many risks, so I figured I could be more adventurous the next time.   If I could choose one word to characterize the meal it would be fresh. I could tell everything was executed well. I didn't love it, but I appreciated the care that went into the meal and the wonderful staff. I'm probably just too accustomed to Americanized food at this point as I just couldn't get the dish hot enough to my liking. But I certainly didn't walk away hungry.   If you really like this cuisine, I would definitely recommend trying this place. Execution was great and the staff was very friendly, helpful, and attentive. It seemed like they took great pride in this restaurant.   The only real complaint I have is the music, which sounded like an hour of top hits from boy bands you've never heard of...not sure what that was all about but I was thankful it wasn't too loud. Ha ha But you can't please everyone!"}
{"text":"Sichuan food has finally come to Charlotte! And boy does it make a splash with Chuan Wang Fu. Like \"300 lb teenage boy that had too? much sugar doing a cannonball into the pool\" kind of splash. In short, the Sichuan that they're serving at Chuan Wang Fu is legit and amazing.  Now, a word about the menu: this place is still transitioning from Umai Sushi to Chuan Wang Fu and, when you come in, they might assume you're here for Umai. I won't judge you if you are (okay, maybe I will a little bit, because this is really dumbed-down sushi meant for white people from the suburbs), but, if this happens, just ask for the Sichuan menu. Okay, with that out of the way, the menu is your typical list of hilariously poorly-translated Chinese. This is something the restaurant should really work on improving. Worry not, I will give you a few helpful suggestions?:  1.) We started with the Dandan Noodles (dan dan mien). These appear under \"cold appetizers\" as \"noodles in chilli sauce.\" These were far and away some of the best Dandan I've had outside of China. Really great flavor and texture and not overly spicy. Crispy bits of ground pork added just the right amount of chewiness. You can't go wrong.  2.) They had a special for the day, Xiao Long Bao, AKA Shanghai Soup Dumplings. While I'm not sure if this is traditional Sichuan food, this is something to which you should never say no. These soup dumplings were above average, they tasted like they weren't homemade or had spent perhaps a bit too long in the steamer, but still had excellent taste and are always a welcome treat. I do wish they had served them with soup spoons so you could eat them in the traditional way.  3.) We opted for the eggplant for one entree. It was terrific and served literally fresh off the grill - it was still sizzling when it came out. The small Chinese eggplants were served extra tender and with a generous amount of flavorful Sichuan chili oil. Each bite melted in my mouth. Outstanding quality.  4.) Finally, we got the shredded pork with vegetables. This, too, was amazing and a neat combination of shredded pork with shredded vegetables and mushrooms. As good as this was served fresh, it made for incredible leftovers once the flavors had gotten a chance to really mingle.  Among other Sichuan specialties were dry pot, do-it-yourself wok, radish cakes, whole fried fish with garlic and chilis, and numerous other delectable offerings. They also have some of the more \"exotic\" dishes that include things like intestines - this is actually pretty common in much of Asia, but hasn't really picked up steam here. Worry not, though: there are plenty of dishes where you can stick with the meats you know (chicken, fish, pork, beef, duck, etc.).  We had a ton of leftovers since they give you a lot of food. Since there was plenty of sauce with each entree, we took them home and added a couple cups of rice to each - this ended up making us each two dinners and two lunches!  Anyway, any small criticisms I direct at Chuan Wang Fu should not distract from the central theme that it's FRICKIN SICHUAN FOOD IN CHARLOTTE. And it's pretty damn amazing. If you know this food, go. Right now. If you don't know it, go introduce yourself to it's awesomeness. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am only giving this place one star because there's no option to give it 0 stars. Not only was the food terrible, but the service was awful. Our sushi had brown avocado & tasted like grocery store sushi. The waiters were very short with us & mentioned that the total of our bill doesn't include the tip when I asked for change back. I would not recommend this to anyone, even if you are starving & it's the last place to eat on earth."}
{"text":"1st visit last night and what an awful experience.  There was no one to seat you and no one to serve at the bar.  Putting in your order was terrible and then to receive your food was ridiculous.  We never received our complete order and left.  They are not organized and do nothing to retain their customers (folks walked out) while others sat looking frustrated."}
{"text":"As with (I suspect) a few dozen/hundred/whatever number of folks, we decided to visit Chuan Wang Fu recently after an article popped up in the Observer about them. Luckily it gave directions on finding them, as the sign does not have that name on the front.  The short version: Look for the sushi place in Quail Corners.  Once inside, it's not terribly different in appearance than most (American) Chinese places, except that many of the employees do not speak terribly good English. And there aren't any good pictures on the menu either. So you might have an adventure on your hands.  As with just about everywhere, the whole thing is rather hit and miss. The first part being which menu you get. They have at least three. One is the Chinese menu, which has things that you aren't likely to see elsewhere (yes, duck blood does appear here - I've had duck blood soup, not really sure what you're getting in this version).  You'll also see relatively simple items like beef with hot chili oil. It packs a bit of a kick, but it comes on slowly. Be ready. There are other tame items like the sizzling chicken, which is served on what looks to be a fajita skillet, has no sizzle (literal or figurative), and has a subtle and tasty flavor. You can also ask for appetizers such as crab rangoon and pot stickers, but I'm not sure where they are listed. I may have just missed them.  The other menu is sushi. They have a lunch version that is \"all you can eat\", but when we were there (yes, at lunch), they didn't offer it. Apparently the sushi rice didn't come in. Which is odd, because people were eating sushi - and some were getting refills, which makes me think that they were either ordering a lot or they indeed had the all you can eat special. And if I were the paranoid type, I would think that they were out to get me and thought I would just eat too much. But it really isn't a big deal. We had plenty to eat otherwise, and there are lots of sushi places to eat.  The final menu is also sushi, but it's a paper version, not a big book type. As far as I can tell, it's the same, just more of a to-go style.  When you go in, the menu seems to be completely random. Sometimes they ask, sometimes they just give you one. We went in and were given the Chinese menu, and we asked so were given the sushi menu (even though we couldn't order from it). Others seemed to get the sushi menu and not the Chinese menu. I have no idea how it works.  The service can be unbearably slow - especially if you have to wait on an English-speaking server after one of the non-English speaking servers comes to help. And even once the order is in, the food can take a while (it seems to be fresh, so that is presumably one reason).  The final tip: Those Chinese portions are monstrous, so even though the prices are high, consider ordering a single entree for every two people. If you have four people order two dishes - or more and take some home - but there is plenty. It's not a one person, one dish kind of place unless you are just insanely hungry."}
{"text":"I have been missing authentic Chinese food.  It has been so hard to find a restaurant in Charlotte that didn't just serve American Chinese food.  It took us a minute to find bc it still had the old sign out front.  I will start by saying that it smelled AH-MAZING inside. We were given the old menu which is not what we were there for, so we signaled for the waitress and asked her for the Chinese menu. She said, \"oh, you want the good food!\" Lol.  The service was fantastic, the food was delicious. It was exactly what we have been missing. We brought or kids with us and they loved it as well. If you are looking for traditional Sichuan cuisine, this is the place!"}
{"text":"8/10 compared with the real authentic Szechuan cruisine, but 10/10 for what you can find in Charlotte or the U.S. I ordered more than my husband and I could eat so I could have a better idea how good this restaurant is. ?????????????are all very decent. The small dishes are just ok. Soup dumplings are not very soupy/juicy, and lack for some flavor. Pan fried buns ??? are unlike anything I had in Shanghai. BUT I will go back there for Szechuan food for sure!!!  Update on 6/9/2018: grilled fish from the signature menu is not good...the fish is just ok, but the vegetables are not good...usually the vegetables are the highlight of this dish....I can't tell how they cook the vegetables or they are just not fresh from frozen food...this dish I will give 1 star..."}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for sushi but my mom wanted Szechuan food so she suggested we go to this place where we could both be satisfied. I was initially given the Chinese menu and had to ask for the sushi menu. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this place for sushi. I had the dragon roll and another roll with salmon (forgot the name) and they were both good but not amazing. And both were more than $10, so the value isn't really there. I appreciate that the rolls weren't loaded with rice like they are at AYCE sushi places. My mom and brother got things off the Chinese menu - a spicy lamb dish, a spicy tofu dish, and another rice noodle dish with beef. I ate some of their food as well and wasn't really blown away by it. Maybe because I'm used to eating Chinese food all the time at home? The spice level was extremely tolerable, surprisingly. Nowhere near as spicy as the food I had when visiting the actual Sichuan Province in China. Everything was really flavorful but it was a little too much. I think 2-3 dishes to share amongst 2 people is ideal. Each person gets a bowl of rice on the side.   Service was prompt and food came out quickly. Not too busy on a Friday night at 8pm."}
{"text":"Wow! The food at this place was awesome.  My husband and I tried this place once we heard it was under new management. We had been dissatisfied with Umai and were excited about authentic Chinese food (we love Japanese food too, but much rather have authentic food no matter which country or region we are sampling). We were given the Umai menus at first. Once we asked for the Chinese menu we had a hard time deciding on what to try. So many delicious options.   We ordered long bao, the beef in hot chili oil, and the eggplant. There was a mix up and they brought us tofu and fish in hot chili oil instead of the beef. They quickly fixed the issue and we got to try all of the dishes. We were so glad for the mistake. My husband thought the fish was better than the beef, and he is a \"beef-guy.\" We both really enjoyed the eggplant too.   The only issue I saw was that they seem to be working out some kinks on the service side of things. Just give them some time and this could become the best authentic Chinese place in Charlotte.   We will be back... as soon as we finish all the leftovers we brought home. :)"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a Sichuan restaurant in Charlotte. Learned of this restaurant from a yelp notification about best dumplings in Charlotte. When I went and looked at the restaurant yelp site I realized that it is a Szechuan restaurant. We knew that we had to try this restaurant and we found out that it is excellent. It has totally legitimate Szechuan food.  It is as good as anything I have had in New York City. Surprisingly it is located in the Quail corners shopping center and a wealthy area of Charlotte. Typically the authentic ethnic restaurants in Charlotte are located along Central Avenue and have somewhat drab decor. This restaurant not only has great food but a great atmosphere as well. Do not be confused by the sign on the front of the restaurant which refers to Umai. Also if the hostess does not hand you a Chinese menu be sure to ask for the Chinese menu. I still don't know the right things to order at a szechuan restaurant but we were able to wade through the menu and try many excellent dishes."}
{"text":"This place is a legit Szechuan restaurant; haven't tried their sushi or mainstream dishes. If you like your Chinese food swimming in red hot chili peppers, this is your spot.   My personal favorite is the fish in hot chili oil and mapo tofu ... and the soup dumplings make for wonderful appetizers while you wait."}
{"text":"Lowest rating possible, a -1 if you can. The restaurant had the worst, worst, WORST service we've ever experienced. We waited on our food for over 45 minutes, so long, we forgot why we were there! One entree came 10 minutes after the other, which is not good at all. The Chinese food, which you have to ask to order from, is weird. Lots of \"stomachs\", \"intestines\" and duck \"blood\" entrees, and a vegetable called \"rape\" (not kidding). The shrimp dish had a halfway decent sauce but the fish was over cooked. The noodles were ok but overwhelming w/the curry--my clothes stunk afterward. We had to ask for everything--plates, napkins, water, serving forks--everything needed to eat w/o bare hands. There was no hostess, the staff was arguing loudly with one another behind the bar and counter, it was a disorganized mess. Perhaps they are switching over straight to a Japanese sushi place. In any case, no return!"}
