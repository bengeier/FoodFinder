{"text":"As of the spring of 2012 (I'm writing this in March) Lucky Season Cuisine and it's good fresh Dim Sum is now closed.  It has changed over to one of those tacky All You Can Eat Hot Pot places that seem to dominate the area of Highway 7 and Leslie.  I'll review it in the Lucky Season Hot Pot thread that has just been created."}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost! This hotpot place is horribly understaffed and undeserving of tips. They even force the service charge on the bill. They lost our order sheet and made us redo it."}
{"text":"Service was alright, but they sat us right next to a pile of dirty dishes and it kinda just smelled bad the entire time... The table was not properly set and the tea was old and too strong. Food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Had dim sum here yesterday. Food was passable. I would say about a 2.5, but the durian pancake was a 4, and the servers were surprisingly friendly.  taro shred with ground pork filling, rice noodle roll with deep fried dough stick, steamed pork rib with black bean sauce, deep fried shrimp dumpling with salad dressing, curry cuttlefish, egg tart all between 2.5 and 3 stars.  Durian pancake and Beef tendon were 4 stars, if not 4.5. Durian pancake had lots of durian flesh inside it, and it was sweet without being overly so. It was also a good sized portion. Beef tendon was super tender and so very tasty."}
{"text":"Short haired boyish cut lady gave us awful service. There weren't enough waiters, and for a Chinese New Year dinner that should only be 2 or so hours long, it took us over 3 hours because we had to chase after the waiter for our food three times. Bad service.  The good was okay. Nothing spectacular, but I did like their noodles and their fried rice. They were probably the best made dishes of the night, and this is coming from a preset CNY dinner of $220+."}
{"text":"They are CLOSED!!"}
