{"text":"Hands down best Indian food in Cleveland. If you want to taste real Indian cuisine, this is the right place for you. My favorite is Andra Chicken and the Shrimp Biryani."}
{"text":"Chicken Dum Biryani - Amazing blend of spices. Good taste!
One of the best Biryani I've had. Cutting down half star on the ambience and service delays!"}
{"text":"I had food catered for an occasion. Food was really delicious. Everyone who came felt very happy with the taste. I ordered goat sukkah, chicken Biryani, chicken koorma for non veg and for veg I ordered veg biryani, chili paneer and veg ball manchuria. Rasmalai for desert completed the dinner in a fantastic way. Best Indian Food in town."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The portions are very generous and everything tastes homemade and is VERY well spiced. I had the vegetable dum biryani, which came with an egg, the corn appetizer, and the gobi manchurian. Everything was delicious. I picked it up to take home, so now sure how the service is, but they looked pretty busy and got everything out on time. The food is HEAVY (as most Indian food tends to be), so this isn't some place I would come often, but it's probably my favorite Indian place in Westlake."}
{"text":"So happy to find an authentic and delicious Indian restaurant within 20 minutes of home. Been there 3 times for lunch and am wowed by the food each time. I'm vegetarian and order the Chef's Daily Special Thali (platter) because it gives a lovely sampling of Indian dishes including Briyani (or Biryani) with lots of fresh, seasonal vegetables, two side dishes including a dal, a small appetizer, Naan and dessert. It's available Tuesday through Friday during lunch. Staff is attentive and friendly. Perfect place for lunch and to get my Indian food \"fix\", which fortunately is easy to indulge now that Biryani Hut Express is open for business."}
{"text":"Excellent place . . Excellent food taste . . I tried Lamb chops,
Chicken biryani and murgh masala .. All were fresh n served hot . .
Above all very fine dine in for people looking fir Halal food . .
The place is usually busy even on the weekdays but they maintain good serving. . ."}
{"text":"Great place to get a good Indian biriyani and friendly service from the staff"}
{"text":"The best biryani I have had since a long time. Very authentic taste with large portions of food has been served. A must visit when you are in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Just had an excellent biryani in cleveland. I had a chicken dum biryani and very much up to the mark. 
Delicious."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! Great service, good people and amazing food! I wish it wasn't so far away from home because I'd go here again this weekend!"}
{"text":"Quite disappointed this time around. Ordered the chicken tikka masala for take out and the portion was small and I counted 5 pieces of chicken. The sauce was really oily and it just wasn't what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Very good biryani. Would recommend to give it a try if you are new to Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the town's best authentic Indian food. They cook real spicy food for people who love it that way. I really recommend the kheema biryani which is one of the best I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Superb service ..everything fresh and hard to find good restaurant near cleveland ...keep up good work"}
{"text":"Great place, so happy to find great Indian food in my area. We got the fried corn as an appetizer and it was amazing - salty, crunchy, spicy and sweet. I got the butter chicken and my fiancé had the goat vindaloo and both dishes were excellent as well."}
{"text":"Super delicious food! Authenticate taste. We ordered Vegetarian Dum Biryani, Paneer Chilli, Veg Manchurian. Super delicious food, spice level is as requested. Cleanliness appreciated. Keep serving good food."}
{"text":"Excellent food.. friendly staff naan are always fresh must try paneer Biryani best Indian place in west side"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've ever had. It tasted to me like what I imagine Indian home cooking to taste like. It was so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"We went to BiryaniHut (newly opened in Westlake) for the first time today and were favorably impressed with the food and service. It is a no frills restaurant (not much in terms of ambience) but the food was wholesome and tasty. We ordered the vegetarian and non vegetarian thali's (complete platters) which came with a vegetarian appetizer, a curry dish, dal (lentils) naan and Biryani (house specialty). The non veg platter had the same types of dishes, but made with chicken. The biryanis were extremely tasty and were in ample proportions. You can ask for the spice level to be adjusted based on your spice tolerance. We asked for medium and it still had a nice kick to it. The service was friendly and the restaurant is clean. We would surely go again and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Wat can I say . Just one word Yum!! Great flavors. My one of the favorite dishes is Kheema biryani(It's minced lamb meat with some of the south Indian spices) . It looks and tastes heavenly. I've ordered it for quite a number of times and it has been consistent in its flavor. The quantity is good for 2 people . The place also provides a variety of other authentic Indian curries.I also enjoyed their appetizers chili corn and jalapeños bajji ."}
{"text":"This place rules!  I hit up most Indian joints In the area and this one is one point.  Their biryani is bangin!  Prices are very reasonable for non-Americanized deliciousness.  Friendly staff is a bonus!"}
{"text":"I have upgraded my rating to a 5 star just for the overall consistency and taste of their dum biriyani. Can't go wrong with this. Chicken is soft and nicely absorbs the taste of the biriyani. Appetizers have been hit or miss but the weekend special called chicken majestic is a must try. The medium spice is a good spice level. The chicken at times can be chewy. The naan is soft. The kids liked the paneer butter masala mild. Prices are decent and take out is on time without any mixup."}
{"text":"The best KEEMA Biryani in town, had a great food. They have an authentic hyderabadi taste of biryani  where the quality is not compromised. I will recommend people to visit this place. Awesome food!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times now, and have been meaning to leave a review. This is my current favorite take-out spot.  If you're in the area at all, you need to get to BiryaniHut Express.  Very friendly staff, and very fresh flavorful food.

What I've had:
Chicken Tikka Masala
Boneless Chicken Biryani - Mild heat
Gobi 65 - Medium heat
Onion Pakoda
Samosa

I'm not even sure that I can pick a favorite, its all so delicious. If you've never had Indian food, this is a great place to start. Go give them your business, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Dinner was excellent!! We had chicken tiki masala, aloo gobi masala, samosas and garlic naan!! Service was great, very friendly! DEF will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've tried many Indian restaurants and this one didn't particularly blow me away. We got the chicken tikka masala and murgh masala. They brought one of the orders out about 5 minutes before the other, which was a bit odd considering we were the only customers there. The chicken was also burnt on the outside layer. The staff seemed friendly and the restaurant was clean, but my overall experience can be summed up as average."}
{"text":"I have been here couple of times now and they added some new items to the menu. I really loved there ulvacharu chicken briyani. It's was simply awesome"}
{"text":"Coming from an Indian girl who loves trying out Indian restaurants as much as cooking Indian food at home, this is the most authentic restaurant you will find in Cleveland. I think this is probably one of the best Indian restaurants I have tried in the states!!"}
{"text":"I am so glad this new restaurant brings authentic Indian cuisine to west side of cleveland. Have tried their biryani, chilli chicken, chicken 65, bhindi masala, malai kofta, tandoori chicken and boy oh boy, never have I been disappointed! It surprises me how this place seems to maintain the quality of food on so many occasions I've been there.. it's great. Thanks for providing some delicious dishes!
Very humble ambience but great food!"}
{"text":"The service here is incredible and the food is even better than that. We came to Cleveland Yelped an Indian restaurant - glad we picked this one. We came for lunch in a group of four. We ordered goat biriyani and Thali's. The food was incredibly flavorful and a great value. We are here for two days and will definitely be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Stopped in one Sunday evening and the place was pretty busy, they even had several people come in for to-go orders too. Staff seemed a little frazzled but still friendly. 

*Chicken Tikka Masala $10.99 - Standard amount of tastiness. I enjoyed this dish, but I thought there was too much rice so I only used half of it. 
*Garlic Naan $2.49 - Pretty good, and excellent for scooping up your masala with.
*Chicken Puff $2.99 - Terrible. Super dry with no flavor. I threw it away. 
*Gobi 65 $7.99 - I think this was good, all I can remember is that my mouth was on fire and they did not include any sort of cool yogurt dipping sauce to balance out the heat. 
*Samosa $3.49 - Standard taste, but smaller than I am used to seeing. 
*Rasmalai $3.49 - Unique spongy milky slightly sweet dessert. Not bad, but one experience was good enough for me. 

All in all I would say this place was A-Okay. No major complaints, but I do think I've had better at Namaste and India Garden in Lakewood. If Lakewood is too far for you then I think Biryani Hut is perfectly okay to dine at. I would rate them 3.5 stars and I will probably give them another try.

Side note: They accidentally charged me tax on my to-go order so just double check before you pay."}
{"text":"Authentic, highly recommended. Had the chili chicken, goat biryani, malai kofta and everything tasted like it came out of my moms kitchen."}
{"text":"The chicken tika Masala and garlic naan was excellent! The samosa platter wasn't the best, almost like they didn't cook it long enough, it was super doughy not crispy like from other places I've ordered it from. Overall, great food, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great casual place for tasty indian food. I love the indian Thaili lunch special, (weekdays T-F only I think, they are closed Monday) where you get a generous tray with a variety of either Vegetarian or Meat-based dishes, including Naan, curries, pakora, rice/biriyani and a dessert. One gets to try new things every time and they are always very tasty. A nice alternative to the buffet, as everything on your plate it super fresh.

I also have ordered dinner from them via Uber Eats, the Palak Paneer is a favorite! And if you love the hot spice like I do, I recommend the Cut Mirchi. But don't worry if you don't care for hot food they are accommodating to all levels of spice preference.

The staff is very friendly and I like that they are attentive to make sure your water glass is full and that you are enjoying your meal.

I understand they now serve Indian Breakfast, which I am looking forward to trying.

Also, a bonus that there is an Indian grocery next door. The sweets are very tasty, and I like to grab some basics there, like dried lentils and fresh veggies."}
{"text":"Another great culinary experience at Biryani Hut Express. The host and waiter was extremely kind and soft spoken. He went out of his way to make sure my family and I were all taken care of. The food from the appetizers to the entrees were all delicious. For those wondering, the meat is all halal which is much appreciated. If you haven't come here, I would encourage you to stop by and experience some delicious food."}
{"text":"Our company ordered a catered lunch for about 50 people from BiryaniHut. Everyone commented on how delicious it was, as they got up for a second serving.  The only problem is that you can't stop yourself from eating more.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for authentic Indian food! I loved the flavors at Biryani hut express and the staff is really friendly . You won't be disappointed and I would totally recommend the place to others.I am a vegetarian and my personal favourites  are paneer biryani and vegetarian ball manchuria!!!! This place is spiced just right."}
{"text":"My second review from them. I was first to review them initially when they opened, now after 3 months running i think they are doing a great job. I almost eat here once a week. My Fav:
Gobi Manchurian
keema biryani 
gulab jamun"}
{"text":"Going by the restaurant name, I was expecting that they would have some authentic biriyani. Alas, good try but not close. I hv tried their chicken and goat biriyani, out of which I prefer the goat biriyani over chicken one. Their biriyani are not bad, good to eat but lacks that authentic taste of spices and condiments. Biriyani is incomplete without the richness of ghee, smell of cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, mint leaves etc. topped with fried onions; and all of which seemed missing in their biriyani imo. Nevertheless, I'd still be a returning customer here as I love biriyani and I haven't found any better biriyani in the area yet. Again, their biriyani tastes good, its just not authentic. 
Please note their spice level. They have mild, medium and hot. Hot is really really hot, be careful on that."}
{"text":"Try Mutton Kheema biryani here. It is awesome and also the starters are very tasty and authentic. Excellent customer service"}
{"text":"We hit this restaurant on our way to Washington. The food was too delicious. It was too good that in our entire trip, whenever we would go for other restaurants, we would always bring up comparison with Biryani Hut and end up not liking whatever we were having. And obviously we had to hit the place again on our way back!

Keep up the good job guys..."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Cleveland ! Most authentic Hyderabadi biryani I have ever had, Would totally recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian spot. My wife got the chicken Tikka Masala and it was the table winner. She knows her Indian food and loved it. I ordered the vegetarian Thali because I wanted to try a bunch of differing things. It was great. 
Always get the garlic Naan!

Staff was great. Restaurant was clean. Great place to expand your palate."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch yesterday with a buddy. He got the vegetarian lunch special while I had the Butter Chicken and some garlic naan.  We also split the veggie Samosas.  I must say it was the best I've had in the area. I could taste all the spices and am dying to go back! Then lunch special was HUGE and was well worth it according to my friend. The Samosas were a little overcooked on the outside but the inside was super delicious!!! I am surely recommending this to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Guys, if you are pakka hyderabadi and biryani lover, this place is awesome. Give a try you will really love it."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I feel compelled to make an online review, but this time I had to...

This is a fantastic restaurant. I have a few Indian restaurants I really enjoy, but this one is by far the best food. Conveniently, BiryaniHut is also priced a little cheaper than other Indian food in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I first time to Biryani Hut Express. Food was amazing and our waiter very polite/helpful. We highly recommend all to come eat or take-out at Biryani Hut Express. The murgh masala and fry tilapia was delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food taste fantastic.. like home made.. they have many dishes both Veg and Non Veg.. missing home made food.. stop by and enjoy."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and they forgot an entire meal. The child pakora had a weird texture. Overall i would say the food is very average"}
{"text":"I am so happy there is a delish Indian restaurant on the West side. I work on the East side and Choolaah has my heart out there but live on the west side so I was happy to try BiryaniHut Express. I got the Spicy Chicken Tikka Masala with garlic naan. The Naan was amazing.. the spice was perfect and flavored to the 9's. The chicken had really good flavor as well. The pricing was normal for Indian plates as you get A LOT of food. Will recommend to friends and have this again."}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times and the food is the best I've had in Ohio so far! The malai kofta and ofcourse the veg/paneer biryani are authentically Indian. However, for a change, I want to mention 2 separate instances of great service:

1. One time it so happened that I arrived after their closing lunch hours, but yet they provided me with a biryani to-go.
2. Another time I'd placed a to-go order but was going to arrive post their dinner closing hours. I didn't have any hopes of a dinner that night, however again they amazed me by suggesting that they will place my order outside the restaurant at a hidden location (sshhh) and there it was!

Simply for the above two cases, I would give them another star for a 6 star rating. Restaurants are there everywhere but is only when you treat food and customers exceptionally that you earn a great reputation.

Keep it up! :)"}
{"text":"I got food poisoned the very night I had a meal from here. Save yourself and skip this place."}
{"text":"Probably the top 5 in Cleveland when it comes to good Indian food. The make it 'indian' spicy if you ask them to. Nice place"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, best Indian food I've tried in Cleveland! I stop here anytime I'm even remotely close to Rocky River. While the casual ambiance is nothing to write home about, the food and the service are fantastic. 

I order the chicken chettinad and garlic naan almost every time I go and find myself craving it even after I've cleaned my plate. I haven't seen this South Indian specialty on many Indian menus and the unique, rich flavors are executed very well here.  

The Crispy Masala Pepper Corn and Palak Paneer are also delicious!

I am looking forward to continuing my regular visits here!"}
