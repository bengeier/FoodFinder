{"text":"We don't usually like our pizza fresh so we come here for an out of the box experience! We also loooove warm salad .  Best part, when our waitress stabbed our bread. It's not delivery it's digiornios."}
{"text":"Super busy place with amazing dishes! You have to bring your own booze though, as they have no liquor licence!"}
{"text":"We went in for lunch. We should have walked out. Pizza was honestly the worst I have ever had, and I've had bad pizza. This was not even the quality of frozen!!! Staff was nice enough to not make me pay for it. Ceaser chicken salad was just ok. Chicken had a fish taste. Lettuce was fresh (I'm trying hard to say something nice). This was at lust after lunch so not sure if cooks were tired, but chalk that one up to bad experience. Too bad, really wanted to like the place."}
{"text":"Le rapport qualité prix n'est pas vraiment respecté... J'ai opté pour la table d'hôte, 35$ pour l'option que j'ai choisie. La soupe aux épinards était correcte. Ensuite j'ai pris une escalope de veau accompagnée de légumes grillés et pâtes (scaloppini armani ou quelque chose du genre). Pour le prix, la présentation est médiocre. De plus, les pâtes à la sauce tomate manquent de saveur et les légumes sautés aussi. Le service était bien, mais pas assez pour oublier la médiocrité du plat. Par contre j'ai rajouté un dessert, un tartuffo chocolat, était vraiment super. Pour toutes ces raisons, je ne retournerai plus là."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the bad reviews! I've been dining here for about 5 years now and I only saw the food and service getting better & better. We always eat out on a friday or saturday night! Service is fast & courteous.   I love their lasagna, penne à la gigi, fried calamari & veal chops. Their dessert is also to die for.   Good spot for a byow experience. Portions are generous and prices are fair! About 100$ for 3 people with appetizers, main course and desert! None of us ever got sick from here.   Love their mini baguettes! Always fresh & hot."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good!   The last time we were there was for a Christmas diner with my mother, husband and daughter.  My husband made a reservation and, as expected, there were a few things we had to conform to because its such a busy day for them. Its ok, we expected it.  But, once there, it felt too busy for their capacity; room wise and staff wise. I kid you not, My husband and I ate diner with the rear-end of one of the guest at the table besides us (perpendicular) that kept on going around to see and great everyone (which is good of her) but we lacked so much room, that she was basically on top of us.  The entrees came so fast to the table that we had not finished our appetisers! And the waitress left with the unfinished plates at the \"end\" of the meal. We felt very much rushed to leave and make space for the people that just kept coming in.   Even if my husband sent them an email, he never even received an acknowledgement or apology.  That was the last time and not even tempted to go back there again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, over priced due to it being a byob.  Penne rosé dish for $20? Average food at best. If this is your cup of tea, then give it a try."}
{"text":"Good service and good food. I recommend trying the chicken luqgano's, the portion is pretty big and it is really good, also try the fettuccine calabrisella,  fettuccine E spinacci Sergio or Cappelini con bocconccini e spinacci"}
{"text":"Awful Italian experience! Not only was the service slow, the food was dreadful. Came here in a family dinner, we were about 22people.   Every single one of us got sick when we got back home. We all had different meals and yet we all got really sick!  It was a horrible experience"}
{"text":"In terms of Italian cuisine, there are plenty of choices to turn to in the Montreal and Laval area. And with the surplus of Italian restaurants in both cities, if you're not the best, you're somewhere lost in the middle.  Based on my meal, I'd say Lugano's falls in the middle. I ordered the rotollo pasta (which is, in essence, a roll of pasta with ricotta cheese between layers and then smothered with mozzarella). Firstly, we received our meal within 10 minutes of ordering it. Maybe even less. That kinda turned me off, as I would have preferred to wait longer to keep up with the illusion that our meal was made fresh and not just freshly served. I get that restaurants do a fair amount of prep before service, but the place was really full; even if it was prepared earlier, the pastas texture was off. The pasta was soft, the stuffing was bland, and the sauce had little flavour. To put concisely, it lacked depth. Not even the oozing mozzarella topping saved it. On the plus side, super warm baguette served before your meal is a win no matter how good or bad the food is, so that was appreciated.   We were in an out of there in less than half an hour. Service was incredibly efficient! My meal could've used a little more TLC though."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for almost 10 years and I truly enjoy it. Yes it was better 10 years ago and through out it's years it has lost some of it's mojo but it is still better than average in my opinion. The prices have increased quite a bit  but since you can bring your own wine it is still reasonable. Food is very good, although I have come to the conclusion than the supper meals are better done than the lunch ones. Probably they have different chefs for the evening service. Staff is friendly and accommodating. My two favourite dishes are the chicken parmesan and the vitello genovese. A great place for groups and family. Inviting ambiance and not too noisy. Give it a shot it might become your new favourite place to have Italian food."}
{"text":"Bonne nourriture mais à un certain prix. Comme les quantités sont grande, le prix peut s'excuser.  Par contre, le service est plutôt absent. J'ai vidé mon verre d'eau avant de commander et je n'ai jamais eu de remplissage ou de demande, J'ai du demander un remplissage . Normalement, dans un resto, les verres d'eau ne doivent jamais être vide pour des raisons de sécurité, Et c'est aussi respectueux de ne pas avoir de verre vide.  Sinon, Je n'ai pas vue souvent les serveuses dans mon coin, pourtant le resto n'est même pas à moitié de sa capacité.  Je vais sûrement y retourner, Mais je ne serai pas un grand habitué. Il y à vraiment beaucoup de plat, Tant en entrée, dans le type de choix italien (pâte, pizza, veau, poulet, poisson, viande), plat sans gluten et plusieurs choix de dessert.  Modification: la serveuse vient d'amener le thé, Mais toujours pas le verre d'eau que j'ai demandé. De plus, Elle est revenu avec la facture sans demandé si nous voulions un dessert (que nous voulons) Et le nombre de facture... Pour le thé, s'il y à des choix de sorte, Je ne les connais pas. En plus, l'eau est tiède.  Ma copine à pris le gâteau tiramisu, semblerait qu'il goûte bizarre et aucun goût de café ou expresso. Pour ma par, J'ai pris le loving spoon. Il faut aimer le chocolat, très sucré"}
{"text":"It has been over 5 years I have not been to Lugano's. I Came last night with a friend and took the Veal scaloppine (table hotel version) and it also came with a clam chowder soup. The soup was all right but my main   course was disappointing. My plate had some pasta, the tomato sauce tastes like it came out of a can, I could of made better at home. I must say the sauce that was put on my veal was the best thing on my plate, it tasted better then the meat itself. The scallops on my plate tasted like they were frozen. I find it's WAY too expensive for the quality of food I got, they have really gone down hill since the last time I came here. It's a shame because they use to be amazing and one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been my family's special occasions choice for the last decade: excellent pizza, amazing veal and delicious chicken. Definetly recommend this place for its great service and italian cuisine."}
