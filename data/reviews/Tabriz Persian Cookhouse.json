{"text":"I was horrified to arrive to find that the hostess informed that was no reservation for my party even thought I called twice, the second time to increase my guest #. So, we waited 25 mins for a table to free up for us. We were able to sit at different tables due to the party size to wait.

After we were seated, we weren't seated with the nice cloth napkins our seating. In fact, no napkins at all at our table?! We had to ask for napkins and was given small paper napkins.  When we asked for the cloth napkins, we were given bigger size napkins?!

My guest and I ordered the meatloaf but we both agreed it was too dry. Otherwise, my other guests did enjoy their meal.

It was hard to get the wait staff attention most of the time."}
{"text":"Upscale Persian food (about 20-25$ for a main, ~10$ for an appetizer). 

There weren't any vegetarian mains on the menu, so in the end I got the eggplant appetizer and a side of rice with beans that the waitress recommended. To be honest, I did not like the dish as it was too sweet (a pomergranate molasses sauce). From what I saw of the menu, it looks like molasses is common in Persian mains. Their doogh (a yogurt drink common to the region) was fantastic though. 

I would not recommend this place if you do not like sweet food as your main course, however I don't think it should get a bad review just because the culture's flavouring don't seem to be my kind of thing (I'd have to go to more Persian places to find out for sure). It looks like it is great quality Persian cuisine, which is not common in this city, and the restaurant was classy with very kind waitstaff and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, unbelievably delicious food, and even friendlier staff! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"To be fair, the food was not bad. The experience was underwhelming and superficial to say the least. We had reservations and although we were promptly seated, we were menu-less and unattended to for fifteen minutes.

What is unforgivable was when we received the bill. We asked for appetizer recommendations, and the waiter pointed to three that would be part of the 'Warm Platter' (not listed on the menu). We asked if these were smaller portions, and he said yes. However, to our surprise, we were charged for all three appetizers. This was not a mistake when we asked. 

Instead of misleading your customers, it would be nice if you disclosed that this 'platter' was just three appetizers put on one plate. Thank you."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a perfect atmosphere. It's very welcoming while feeling like a nice restaurant at the same time. 

The food was amazing. Middle eastern food is one of my favourite cuisines - but you always end up getting the same kebab and rice dishes wherever you go. This is the most unique and flavourful middle eastern restaurant I have tried. I ordered multiple appetizers and a couple mains and they were all fantastic and full of flavour - you really can't go wrong. Each dish on the menu is one that I have not tried at any restaurant in Toronto - and tasted great!

I'm excited to come back so I can try everything on the menu. My favourite dishes were the eggplant appetizers."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere, very friendly. The Kofteh Tabrizi is full of flavor with tasty herbs. Different rice with herbs and Zafran is among other tasty food in Tabriz restaurant. Persian desert is a great conclusion for your meal. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere and authentic Persian cuisine! Must try the eggplant appetizer, kofta entree and the puff pastry dessert! Great place for a good night out."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, pleasant ambient. nice place for groups and families. desserts are awesome."}
{"text":"The best Persian food I've ever had. Ghormeh sabzi is to die for. 
Very friendly staff and warm atmosphere.
Highly recommend this place. Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"I love this place. not only are the owners incredibly welcoming and friendly,but the food is delicious, and this is a wonderful place to try it if you haven't yet... \"highly recommended\""}
{"text":"Tabriz is in a location that does not feel like it should succeed. It is located on Bay Street at the base of a condo building. There are no major destinations nearby and most people are probably more likely to go to Yorkville or the Yonge Street strip for mediocre food.

The food and the service here was exceptional. I was craving Persian food and did not want to venture to Yonge and Finch for a meal.  Had planned this visit to coincide with a visit to the Ed Mirvish Theatre for a show last night. This was an excellent pick.

The restaurant is not large but it is warm and welcoming. The server brought a small plate of walnuts, pickles and feta like cheese along with warm Persian flatbread. All delicious.

I had the Anar Bij which is a meatball stew with a walnut-pomegranate sauce. This comes with basmati rice. If I were at home, I would have finished the sauce. Just so good.

If you like lamb shank, order the Baghali Polo which is lamb shank. Also served with rice but this is an herbed rice studded with almonds. This dish was a winner and I definitely will come back to order my own!

I was ecstatic to see people coming in steadily. Some came for date night while others were having a Saturday night dinner with their family.

Definitely returning."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot more. The menu is extremely limited, to the point of missing on staple cuisines like Koobideh. 

The restaurant itself is very clean and well taken care of. The servers are informative and friendly. We were brought a basket of barberry bread and feta cheese, walnuts and pickles to accompany the bread before our meal. Very tasty and fresh. 

I ordered the Gheimeh which is a sort of stew with lentils and beef and comes with rice on the side. My meal was tasty an fresh. 


I think for the price point of their menu, they should expand the options and/or provide larger serving sizes."}
{"text":"Very good and reasonable prices.  Really enjoyed my dinner here.  Too bad I didn't have room for dessert!  Hope to come back next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Small portions and overpriced. Tasty - but not justified for a weekday lunch. Every business in that location goes belly up within a short time, rent must be insane. Advice is to get more regular clients by lowering prices so people can keep coming and bring their colleagues! Ppl should not leave hungry either! Invest! Get a new business model because the food is good."}
{"text":"Nice enviornment and the food was better than expected. The location is quite convenient and its a good place for a weekend date."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere...fairly decent service.  Don't expect some of the traditional dishes found in Persian restaurants like 'koobideh' etc...the menu is very limited yet good."}
{"text":"Saw a post on blogTO raving about the place, read the 5-star reviews on Yelp AND TripAdvisor.. and I was so confused. My date and I came with high expectations, but the restaurant didn't deliver. Don't get me wrong, service was excellent, the ambiance and music of the restaurant set the perfect mood for a date night, and the complimentary appetizers (warm, crispy bread, cheese, pickles, cashews... okay, the cashews were kind of strange since they were bland and soaked) started the meal off strong. 

But when it came to our entrees, we were a little less than disappointed. My date got the Koofteh Tabrizi, and I got the Ghormeh Sabzi. I really want to give our meals the benefit of the doubt, but we both found the food fairly bland, and I was reaching for the salt shaker more than once. Maybe we came on the wrong night, maybe we ordered the wrong things - I don't know. 

The price is not terrible, but definitely wasn't worth the $17-20/person for the meal considering the taste and quantity. Would not go back to try it again. 

Everything, aside from entrees, is 9/10. However, food is pretty important and definitely didn't live up to the hyped-up reviews, so 5/10."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! Tabriz is perfect for a date night or a special occasion, it's nestled underneath a condo just north of Bay and Wellesley, just a five minute walk from Wellesley station. 

My friend and I got here at around 8pm on a Wednesday night and I noticed that there was only one other table seated which alarmed me at first but I attributed it to the 9pm closing time. After being promptly seated, I was given a the food and drink menus. It's small menu, which made arriving at a decision pretty easy. 

For the appetizer we got the Kashkeh Bademjoon ($9). This dish was a favourite that night! Considering that you're ordering something else as well, this could easily be shared amongst three people. It consisted of charred eggplant as the base and was separated into quarters by a whey paste which had a similar taste/texture to hummus. Each quarter had different toppings like sauteed chopped garlic, chopped walnuts, crispy fried onions, and some sort of black sauce that I couldn't really distinguish - though it tasted great. This was our first time having Persian food so I didn't really know how to approach it, I just ended up using it as a spread on the complimentary bread that was provided and it tasted great! I'd give this dish a 5/5.

For the entrees, we ordered the Koofteh Tabrizi ($20) and Baghali Polo ($22). The Koofteh Tabrizi had the option of being accompanied with either a salad or rice. My friend went with the salad but rice would have probably fit the dish better as the bocce ball sized meatball came in a bowl with some flavourful gravy. The meat was so finely minced it was a surprise that it kept it's shape. The sauce/gravy that comes with the dish is essential because I found the meat to be somewhat dry just by itself. Overall it was an okay dish, I'd give it a 3/5.

The second entree was the Baghali Polo, the lamb shank was really tender, all you needed was the fork to eat the entire dish as cutting the meat was unnecessary. It was accompanied by a side of herbal rice that was really flavourful and had some beans embedded in it for extra texture (Pretty big fan of texture differences). The barberries added a nice colourful touch to presentation and a sweet accent to taste. An additional cup of what seemed to be the gravy from the shank was also provided. It had a thin layer of oil on top of it, so for some that are more health conscious having the option to moderate it was a nice touch (I smothered it all over though). Overall I'd give this dish a 4/5.

For dessert, we got the Saffron Ice cream ($9) which caught us by surprise because it was really flavourful! It was topped with slices of pistachio nuts and the ice cream itself was great. I think I tasted some rose syrup flavours in the ice cream as well? That would explain the nostalgic flavour. I strongly recommend getting this if you visit! I'd give the ice cream an easy 5/5 rating.

The service at this restaurant was great, the food arrived without us having to look for it and in the order they should. Our waiter was super nice as well, he came by on multiple occasions to check up on us. Additionally, our meal ended up taking much much longer than their 9pm closing time, but not once were we rushed or reminded that they were closing soon and instead they patiently waited till we finished our entire meal. This was greatly appreciated amongst the unfairness we provided them by staying much longer than we should have. 

We ended up picking more of the expensive items from each course, and they they do have cheaper options if you just browse the menu. I definitely would recommend dropping by this place at least once. Overall I believe the price was reflective of the experience we had there and I will most definitely try and come back to try the Faloodeh!


TL;DR :

Kashkeh Bademjoon (Eggplant dish): 5/5
Koofteh Tabrizi (Meatball dish): 3/5
Bagali Polo (Lamb Shank): 4/5
Saffron ice cream: 5/5

Great service, good ambience, tasty food items. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday lunch with a group of coworkers one of which was Persian. :) 
Upon entering Tabriz ambiance and lovely, with contemporary decor, open concept seating, cute little bar, its almost the perfect date night type of place.
The service was exceptional and courteous. 
As for food we tried a handful of appetizers; 
**Kashkeh Bademjoon - Charred eggplant with walnuts, Persian dipping sauce topped off with crispy garlic was delicious.
**Bademjoon Kebab- stuffed baby eggplants beautifully blended with pomegranate was another hit! 

as for main entree I had their Koofteh Tabriz, beef meatball with herbs and spicys, dipped in a delicious gravy topped off with crunchy onions. 
this was quite a meal! 

Overall presentation was excellent, food, quality and service!!!

I'll be returning sometime this month with coworkers for a second round."}
{"text":"Cozy and warm, tasty food. If you'd like to try most popular Persian dishes, definitely this is the place."}
{"text":"Authentic Persian cuisine, flavorful, good portion sizes. Everything we ordered was excellent. Very impressed. Clean, with well planned and executed decor. And the staff is so friendly. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"- What I have tried:
  + Kashkeh Bademjoon (4/5): They topped charred egg plants with so many ingredients, very flavourful and it also came with breads. My bf is not a fan of eggplants but he loves this dish a lot 
  + Baghali Polo (4/5): really enjoy this, lamb shank was sooooo tender and the rice was tasty as well. 
  + Koofteh Tabrizi (3/5): Basically a huge meat ball with different kind of herbs inside, I thought it was just ok, need rice or bread to eat with. 
- Service was good and attentive 
- Music and atmosphere here are very relaxing 
- Their portion is pretty big, I would be full with just one dish
- Price is about $20-22 a dish (the kashkeh bademjoon was $12). The food overall was good but no wow factor"}
{"text":"Literally one of the best place I've ever been, 
I'm from Los Angeles  Capital of Persian food , BUT , 
The food here was BOMMMMmMMMMmM
I would say I had the best waiter ( PEGAH ) , she was so nice and professional
Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Excellent seating and service. Atmosphere is really great, good for groups or dates. Food was very good, would recommend for anyone looking to try Persian food. I would definitely come back if I was thinking of having this flavour again."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed by my experience and meal here. I am actually very surprised by the positive reviews. 

We arrived around 12:15pm and the place was completely empty (that should have been a red flag). Once seated our waitress asked for our drink order, and we decided to stick to water (it was our lunch break on a weekday). We quickly ordered and the first thing I asked for was for no onions. The waitress said that none of their dishes have onions - which I found really odd. So I inquired further, then she clarified that they were cooked, so I would not taste them - hence, she thinks onions do a disappearing act once cooked. Sigh. We finally agreed to get the sauce on the side. She came back with our dishes and she noted that \"no, they could not put the sauce on the side because there really are lots of onions in it.\" Huh?! Then she explained that ALL Persian food comes with onions and are impossible to remove - not true, but whatever. 

The food itself was bland, and way overpriced for what you got - we piled on the salt, pepper and hot sauce - but there was not much we could do to elevate the flavors. I am so embarrassed that I suggested this place to my friends. 

Stick to Sheherzade, Pomegranate, or even Darvish in the city."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible! Went for a Sunday lunch a couple weeks ago and loved everything! The menu is quite small, which I prefer and the dishes the wine list excellent! Staff are kind and overall it's a delicious and pleasant experience."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experience I had entire my life it was this restaurant ,I have to cancel my order it is  Embarrassing for owner!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Tabriz. The place is tiny, but it never got too crowded. I met a friend from ages ago and we stayed there talking for probably over 4 hours! Even though we spent a long time there, none of the staff tried to kick us out and we felt very welcome there. The food is very delicious. I tried kashke bademjan and Bij (meatballs in sour sauce, which tastes just like fesenjan).   

Their house wine (we tried white) was very good. They have a very small selection of desserts as well, worth a try. Overall, great experience, but I wish there were more options on the menu. 

The owner came and personally welcomed us and told us that they are planning to add more items, including kabab in the near future."}
{"text":"I wandered into this place somewhat blind and was a little surprised that it wasn't less expensive, given it's location tucked away in the ground floor of a nondescript condo. I guess it is Bay Street, after all?

But I'm glad it happened, because the food was so good. Yes, the space is nice. The server was really friendly and just attentive enough without being too attentive. But it's all about the food, right?

This was one of those meals I can't stop thinking about. I got the Baghali Polo and it was fantastic. I tried my friend's food and it was really hard to decide which was better.

It's a little dangerous that this place is so conveniently located, because you'll want to go back."}
{"text":"I love the Koofteh Tabrizi! Yum! It's a Persian restaurant with foods from a very specific ethnic group in north western Iran. Tabriz is a city with a majority of Iranians with Turkish heritage and their food and culture is amazing. Can't wait to go back to this place soon!"}
{"text":"The place is great. It has a very nice atmosphere and the food is really good. Definitely try this place out if you like Persian food."}
{"text":"Floored. My friends and I were completely floored by this place. (Warning: Long post to explain why!)

Everything was wonderful: food, atmosphere and the SERVICE. The first two things were already amazing - but the continuously thoughtful service throughout our meal, made it an unforgettable experience.


ATMOSPHERE: Tucked away under a condo off Bay St. at Wellesley, it's got a patio and decent sized dining room. Nice, dark wooden & glass decor. Giving off an upscale vibe - but staff make you feel very welcome with the most genuine care and professionalism.


SERVICE: As mentioned above - their service is top notch. I haven't been so impressed with service in a long time. And this isn't even an exclusive, and over-priced restaurant where you must pay for excellent service. Here, you really feel that family-owned love. Where staff are truly aiming to make your experience the best it can be.

Four things that happened during our meal which made us leave a big tip:

1. One of my friends is lactose intolerant. Upon asking the manager what type of whey was used in a particular appetiser (it was made of cow's milk) - the manager offered (without us asking; my friend was going to just skip the dish & not make a big deal of it) to bring another portion of the appetiser minus the whey. The alternate dish that came was basically the same size as the original.

2. We came in with our own dessert (custom birthday cake) - and without prior notice to the restaurant (I know, not cool on our part...). Most restaurants would baulk at this - and charge a service fee. Not at Tabriz! They welcomed my friend who brought the giant cake platter in - and immediately offered to place it in the fridge - without fuss or extra fees.

3. Two our of our three entrees arrived at the same time. Well, sort of... a third dish came out with them that we obviously did not order. Upon inquiring with our waiter - he said it was a complimentary (FULL) entree because our actual third dish was taking longer than the other two. We were fully expecting the third dish to take longer (it was the lamb shank) - and did not experience the generous offer. AND the lamb dish came out no more than 10 minutes later.

4. We had a lot of food left over (and it was all so delicious) - so we asked to have it packed up to go. The manager TOPPED up the stew for us, and personally packaged all carefully.


PRICE: Really affordable for the deliciousness & quality of food - and the exceptional service. Without ordering drinks, my 3 friends & I split the bill evenly. For 2 appetisers & 3 entrees - it came to $20 (after tax) per person!


FOOD: Everything was super tasty. Highly recommend all the things we tried...

Kasjkeh Bademjoon - a yummy dip charred eggplant, Persian whey paste, garlic & walnut dip, topped with crispy fried onions. Comes with flat bread for dipping. Great for sharing.

Salad Shirazi - a refreshing salad of diced tomatoes, onions & cucumbers, topped with herbs in olive oil lime vinaigrette

Anar Bij - slow cooked pomegranate molasses & ground walnut stew with herbed meatballs & basmati rice. Great tasting stew and goes well over the rice.

Koofteh Tabrizi - meatloaf. A lovely savoury sauce that goes great on rice. A very generous portion.

Baghali Polo - broad beans & herbed rice, served with braised lamb shank. SO GOOD. Hands down my favourite entree. (But then, I've always been partial to lamb and game meats :P) The meat was fall-off-the-bone, super tender and not too gamey.

Gheimeh - Beef & split pea stew topped with crunchy fries, served with basmati rice. Very flavourful. The crunch of the fries provide a nice mix of textures.


I can't recommend this enough. I look forward to returning and try other items from the menu!"}
