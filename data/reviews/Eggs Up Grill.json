{"text":"My wife and I had been here previously and were quite pleased with it.  So we decided to go back and treat ourselves to a nice breakfast one Saturday.  Got in and to a table very quickly and ordered.  And then it all went downhill....  we waited and we waited and we waited....  After 15 minutes another server came by to ask if we had ordered.  No asking about refilled our coffee (my cup actually had a chip out of it).  And another 30 minutes or more and no food.  Other tables came in later and were served before us.  We had seen our server spend time at the cash.  She eventually came by to say that they were really busy and apologized for the slow service.  Problem is that both my wife and I saw her take our orders out of her pocket, look at them and them put them in at the kitchen.  So she forgot to put the orders in and then LIED about it.  She had nothing to say in response to us saying we saw what she had done.   The \"manager\" tried to make nice, by some flimsy apology and then he gave us the \"employee discount\" which basically covered the price of our coffee.  Should have walked out and left them to figure out what to do with our food when they finally got it made.  Which by the way, the home fries were burnt and some parts of our meal never came. This is not a place to go when looking for a nice treat for a weekend breakfast !!"}
{"text":"This a good breakfast place. Not very busy when I was there few months ago, the staff is nice."}
{"text":"Good food, fair prices. And the good news is they will soon be open in the evenings."}
{"text":"I won't be back, how hard is it to make toast? I think the home fries have been on the grill for awile, coffee not very hot. Place is kind of beat up. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Greasy spoon. Had brunch here today for the first and last time. Toast was warm bread with melted butter...was maybe waved over a toaster but it certainly wasn't toast. Eggs were overcooked  and home fries were a mush of potatoes with some type of coating...disgusting. Server removed plates and could have cared less that the plates were still full of food. In a good restaurant, if food was not eaten, they would at least have asked if there was a problem. Then again in a good restaurant, they would never have served this. Will drive into Whitby or Oshawa in future."}
