{"text":"I read some of the reviews and was almost hesitant to go...glad we did.

Yes, they are open for lunch.  No, they don't take credit/debit cards.  The service was wonderful.  Everyone was attentive and cordial and helpful...not just our server who was great.  

We ordered the Baked Ziti.  Two people shared it and we barely made a dent in it. We ordered a small pizza and it was great...deserving of all the accolades.

There's a reason this place has been around for so many years.  And as we pulled out it was nice to see the old sign from the space next door to remind us of that.  Visit Guido's...you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Last visit was the first disappointing visit EVER. Our order included the Chef Salad, pepperoni was listed  as an ingredient. I guess we should have not been too disappointed as the menu did not mention more than 1 piece of pepperoni; seriously we were hard pressed to find much on the salad other than lettuce and cheese, probably not worth the $ 11.00 menu price. Went there for lunch, most of the staff was more interested in getting drinks and talking to each other than serving the guests; this seems to have become the norm for the younger staff all over as well as here at Guido's . We will probably restrict our visits to the evenings when service is usually better. We find the best service to be from Marna, so if you can ask for her. The chicken parm and homemade angel hair was as good as always. We ordered an extra side of pasta, not sure why they came out at two different times. When the check arrived the price on the menu per item did not match the price on the check. We paid more than the menu price for the salad and less than the menu price for chicken parm. I think we saved a dollar, but how as a server do you not know the menu prices or where to get them from. I hope this last visit is not a sign of things to come. We truly enjoy Guido's and hope they do not change things such as the salad ingredients. We do not care what the price at Guido's is or how much it is increased. We often brag that it is the consistency that brings us back again and again. That was not the case on this visit."}
{"text":"We have always loved Guidos. Great family owned establishment. If you ever need to make plans for dinner. Do yourself a favor and get to Guidos. You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Guido's catered my sons graduation party (150 people) on July 11, 2015.  Guests were thrilled to see they would be dining on Guido's pizza, Chicken Parm, cavatellis, sausage, peppers and onions as well as a delicious salad with homemade dressings and rolls to die for!  The quality of the food was EXCELLENT and the homemade FLAVORS made for an exceptional meal!  Not one person left hungry and we had plenty of leftovers to share with family and friends. THANK YOU SO MUCH Carmen, Rose, Kathy, Marissa, Domenic and the staff from Guido's for helping to make this such a special party for my son!"}
{"text":"Seriously people - the best pizza around.   It's fantastic.  and I didn't even try the pizza the first 5 or 6 times we went here!!  I LOVE their red sauce, it's my favorite since my Nani's......  try it with their homemade spaghetti.
There isn't much room inside, and if you are trying to eat in, you have to time it right (go early or late!) or you'll be standing around for a while.....   but absolutely WORTH IT!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great family.. They have been doing things the old fashioned way and it works! Not only is the pizza great but the meatballs are a meal in itself! Prices are a little high, but from what I've seen everything is fresh and handmade- no cans all over the place like some local pizza spots in Chesterland."}
{"text":"Guidos is far and away my FAVORITE pizza place. In the whole world. I live in Chicago, but every time I'm home visiting family, I have to get their pizza. It's double the cost of most places in the area, but considering it's ten times better, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food new location is awesome I see a lot of wining about credit and debit cards in these reviews but they have an atm and take checks.  I just wish I lived closer best pizza in this state I've found. The sauces don't come from a jar like most restaurants I've been to lately I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing experience! This small pizzeria was recommended to us by some friends since we're new to the area. We had a \"test pizza\" which was excellent. Thick, chewy crust with great sauce and just the right amount of cheese. 

The veal parm was huge and of very high quality. Really impressive. 

The pasta dishes were also great and regular portions are enormous. We have leftovers for a week!

The best part was the service. Very nice, friendly atmosphere and very family oriented. They messed up our pizza order but gave us a fresh cheese on the house AND followed up with our original. When the found out we were new to the area they chased is down to give us a free coupon. This is how a local pizza joint should be. Warm, inviting, friendly with great food!"}
{"text":"Can NOT give any stars because we walked up to the door and saw the sign that said NO credit/debit CARDS ....... Really in 2013 ...... You just lost us"}
{"text":"The pizza is great as are the pasta dishes.  Tried just about everything on the menu and always feel satisfied with the quality and portions.  The one downside is cash only but the food outweighs the need to carry cash.  If your looking for good Italian food then I would recommend going there.  If your looking for high end dinning with smaller portions go somewhere else."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza's in Northeast Ohio. The sausage is my favorite. It's cash only and closed on Sundays. We have been eating their pizza's a couple times a month since 1965 or so.  They have recently moved into a brand new building near the old pizza parlour. Very nice and classy.

My wife has used them to prepare the food for bridal and baby showers. Always a crowd pleaser! The Albino family have run it since they opened in the 60's. Now it's the son and grandson's that do the work. The food still maintains the highest of quality because its not a chain.

Just a caution it gets busy on Friday and Saturday nights so you may be waiting for a table if you come at the busy times."}
{"text":"The generous portions of delicious food that Guidos serves should be criminal.  For $20, you can get Chicken Parmesan... three giant cutlets, a mound of homemade pasta and a nicely sized salad.  

I couldn't eat even half of it.  But I do have lunch (and even dinner!) for tomorrow.

Not a lot of seats in the restaurant, although they are moving to a new location right next door to the original very soon.

One minor downside is they don't take credit or debit cards, so stop at the ATM beforehand."}
{"text":"They opened an hour early for our party of 10 on a Saturday afternoon. How fantastic! The owner was extremely welcoming and friendly, as was everyone I came in contact with there, truly a great cozy, family atmosphere. The restroom situation is interesting, you have to go through the kitchen and dodge the entire extended family, dodging a pregnant woman, a handsome young Italian boy ;), and of course grandma Guido herself haha. Although an obstacle, the family makes you feel completely comfortable as you awkwardly make your way to and from. Good news, kitchen is very clean ;) 

The pizza was delicious and Ã¼ber cheesy! Loved the sauce especially. Crust gets my praise, crispy bottom with a nice soft bite. Like heaven on earth for a moment. Prices are kind of high, but you can tell they use fresh Ingredients, so I was ok with the cost. 

This place gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling, I adore it and the cute family that runs it. Wish I lived closer to it!"}
{"text":"I have been eating sausage and pepperoni pies from Guido's for the better part of four decades. When I was 5, I stole the tip off of the table and my old man marched me back in and sat me right on the counter and made me tell Guido what I had done. I would like to believe that Guido's quit stealing the tip talk led me away from a life of crime. Great family run business that consistently turns out great food. While it would be hard to pick a favorite pizza (Mama Santa's on the Hill, Giordano's, Geraci's, NOCE...), this place is truly one of the best. It ain't cheap, and it sure ain't Papa John's."}
{"text":"This place has the best eggplant parm I have ever had! The portions are huge and you can never leave hungry. Note they only take cash. If you love Italian food this is a must place to visit, the pizza is awesome too"}
{"text":"There aren't many of these true family owned pizza / Italian restaurants left. This is the real deal it's located in a tiny strip mall at the main intersection in Chesterland from the outside it doesn't look like much but once you enter you can  smell the authentic aromas coming from the kitchen and if you are lucky enough to find a seat you are in for a real treat I have eaten in and ordered take out many times and have never been disappointed, being a regular at one point when I lived in the area  I was always called by name and usually got a little special treatment it's the family way. 

If you order paste you must order the home made paste for a small up charge this will ensure you get the true authentic experience you crave the pizzas are still put together and baked in the old old square pizza pans that I'm sure have been used from the beginning of time this makes a differences believe me. The staff is always friendly and attentive and it's so nice to hear the family's interaction while working in the kitchen they work very hard to do things right and the same way everyday they never have an off day when the food is less than any other time it's called pride and you can trust everything they serve is consistent. I highly recommend you treat yourself and give them a try."}
{"text":"I've been eating Guidos pizza since they opened in Euclid....i live in California now and whenever I come back to CLE I always get a pizza....eating a cold slice now at the airport....IT is the best.  Great quality at a good price.  Just wish I didn't have to travel so far to enjoy one.  I'm just happy they are still here doing great!"}
{"text":"Cash Only!! No credit or debit cards here but there is a cash machine in the lobby.  

No alcohol either you can BYO wine.  

Traditional Italian menu with pizza, pasta, veal and chicken.   I had the veal Milanese with fettuccine Alfredo. Fettuccine was excellent. The veal was probably just a three out of five stars.   Average.  

The meat and cheese  ravioli was excellent.  Pizza was good."}
{"text":"I have acquired a taste for Tommy V's Pizza & Pastaria which is a competitor of Guido's, opened by a former employee. But this is a review of Guido's.  Since opening the new place, they are now open for lunch which is a game-changer.  Lunch has always been an \"Asian food\" institution here as that was the best option available here in Chester. There are two Chinese and one Thai restaurant, as well as a crowd of other pizza places open for lunch (not counting fast-food chains).  Guido's is the very best pizza and their sausage sub sandwich w/cheese is to die for.  The rest of the menu is OK, but a little pricey for a neighborhood pizza place.  Almost all of the other pizza stores are open for lunch, so I guess it is about time that Guido's joined the party.   I've lived here for 42 years and Guido's was here when I came..."}
{"text":"Good salads, spaghetti and meatball subs.  Pizza can tend to be too much crust and not enough toppings due to thickness.  Big disappointment was the chicken parmesan which wasn't very good. Actually, it was some of the worst chicken parm I have ever had.  I tried it twice thinking maybe the first time was just a bad day for the cook.  Nope!  Chicken parmesan was \"casserole style\" and was too thin, dry, overcooked and lacking melted cheese.  Casserole style in small oval dish wherein half the chicken was hanging half way over the edge of the dish isn't very appealing and just makes it harder to eat.  Service was very good.  They don't take credit cards which is inconvenient but they do have an ATM."}
{"text":"Don't try and go before 4pm...they aren't open.  And don't try and pay with a credit or debit card...they don't take them.  But do order a salad with the house italian.  Yum diggity.  And of course the pizza is great.  Always get extra sauce.  Their red sauce is money.  They do a huge takeout business so the restaurant gets cramped with people waiting for their food.  There are only 10-12 tables max in this place.  The servers hustle their buns off so service is very good.  BYOB.  And bring your wad 'o cash, jabroni.  In January 2015 they are moving to a bigger space next door."}
{"text":"Used to love Guido's, but since the move, it's definitely not the Old place i've loved for over 40 years. The lasagna was so salty that i couldnt eat it, rolls brought to the table were burnt black, and when pointed out we were told they'd be replaced (still waiting) the service was horrendous. I'm afraid that was the last time, i'll just remember the old place and smile, pretending that they just went out of business, and didn't rebuild, a much sweeter memory"}
{"text":"Being that I am not from the area, friend suggested it was good. First their mini pink menu never emotion cash only. Arriving there I noticed a counter sign no credit/ debit cards. That already unconvinced me big time. Never mention on the phone. So I borrowed cash took the pizza and did not like the taste at all. Toppings undercooked, sauce to sweet. End crust was good except the rest. No way is this pizza is the best. I would never go back."}
{"text":"Guidos is a family run pizzeria with homemade sauce, pizza and pasta! The employees are fantastic and are always warm and friendly. My favorites are the eggplant parm and the melt in your mouth cavatells.  Highly recommend them for parties or family gatherings as well."}
{"text":"The food is crappy here and it's overpriced. This place is very small inside and they try to cram in a lot of people in a building that has a dining area about as big the dining area in McDonald's. I got lemon chicken and it costs $16 and it was just only 3 flat pieces of chicken with some lemon wedges on it and I paid $3 more for pasta that was undercooked and had sauce that tasted like it was from a jar. The salad was $2 and there was no pepperoncini with the salad and the bread was burnt. This place is almost like Hell's Kitchen because half of the table gets their food first and the other half gets their's 20 minutes later. This place doesn't accept credit or debit cards, just cash or check only. Don't they realize it's 2015 and nobody writes checks anymore. Even amish owned businesses in the area that I am from take credit and debit cards. If you want good Italian food, go to Mangia Mangia in Newbury, Mario Fazio's in Willoughby Hills or Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Beautiful new location. The longer hours work well for my wife and I. We love the pizza and house salad, our usual order. Friendly and attentive staff. This family run restaurant always thanks us for our patronage . Can't wait to go again. Thank you guido's."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong ordering takeout from here. They have great pizza and other Italian dishes. Best pizza for miles. Best way is to call in the order and then go and pick it up or order by phone on the way home from work. There can be quite a wait if you go to the store and order there. Hey, they're busy because they're good."}
{"text":"They recently expanded and are experiencing growing pains. Service and product used to be second to none, but obviously the monstrous building they are in now is way too much for them. Called hours before closing time on a Friday night AND THEY WERE OUT OF PIZZA. Yes folks, the place nicknamed a \"Pizza Haven\" was out of pizza."}
{"text":"Very good homemade spaghetti and meatballs.  Ask for extra sauce. I wasn't a fan of the parm eggplant sandwich, but maybe that's just me.  Overall, I would highly recommend Guidos."}
{"text":"Their eggplant parmesian is to die for. I had it a week ago and had to return again tonight. The best I've ever had anywhere, hands down. Plus the homemade pasta with meat sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place because it's been opened and family operated since I was a kid. Not much has changed over the years other than the new building.  The food is the same (very good), and it still has that family feel. But one flaw is that some of the waiters and waitresses can get a little lazy with things such as making my sure the people are taken care of. Their deep dish pizza is very good even for people like me who prefer thin crust. And when you go there make sure you have cash because they only take cash."}
{"text":"Every Chesterland-er knows that Guido's is the best pizza/pasta joint around town. I've never ever been disappointed at Guido's. Their pizzas are cooked to perfection, subs are outta this world, and the pasta? My mouth is watering just thinking of their delicious angel hair pasta topped with creamy marinara. 

Don't forget to order a side salad with their homemade dressing. It's just so freaking good people!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Italian place around. Service is great, food is better! Best chicken parmesan hands down. 10 stars."}
{"text":"Great food.   They are moving next door to a brand new building, place is a little small currently.  Loved it so much on my first visit, I ordered some pasta for an office party."}
{"text":"Sure enough my daughter came in from out-of-state and wanted guidos for dinner to my regret I said okay. Sure enough we ordered a large pepperoni sausage pizza and once again the crust was a little bit crispy but the interior was so soggy and every thing fell right off

 Never again."}
{"text":"Soe of the best pizza in Cleveland.  the square cut, the crust is the perfect texture, seet sauce and very very melty mozzarella.  Simply delicious.  Toppings are great, the red pepers are excellent, the sausage homemade.  Guido's ew dining room is great.  Well worth the trip to Chersterland!"}
{"text":"Guido's has a ATM machine right in the restaurant.
So no reason to pass up this excellent Italian restaraunt!!"}
{"text":"My mother has been talking about their pizza for 30 years.
I finally had some, and it was really good.
And I'm not a huge pizza person.

I need to try the rest of what they have, and then probably give them their 5th star.
It isn't fancy, just your local Italian American food. 
Done right."}
{"text":"When I was a kid growing up in Chesterland Ohio my parents would take us to Guido's Pizza Haven for dinner. The place was a classic Pizza Joint that was family-run. I remember these two have a cocktail asteroids machine in there at one point it was covered in Pizza Grease and we pumped quarters into it like crazy. Guido's Pizza is something that I can't explain and you would never understand if you haven't had it. Those who have had it will always love and cherish it because it's freaking awesome. It's got a thicker crust that is a little crispy on the edge maybe because of the oil that they use to oil the pans. I think the sauce level is perfect although some people say it's a little too Saucy because the cheese slides off it but that's what I like about it. My favorite is the pepperoni and sausage. The sausage isn't like something you can buy at the store it's crumbly sausage that looks like you can only get it one place. Guido's. What I like best about this place is not only is it awesome when you take the pizza home it's just as good heated up the next day. They will also cellu pizza that is partially cooked you could take it home and cook it the rest of the way which is great when you have family members who are jonesing for Guido's Pizza out of town. Freeze it and take it. I will always give this place five stars and I would give it more than 5 Stars if I possibly could."}
{"text":"Best pizza around! They are always busy but never disappoint!  Order a double pepperoni pizza well done, you won't be sorry! Cash only!"}
{"text":"Food is always incredible - That is not an exaggeration! The wait can sometimes be long, even with the larger restaurant now it is in high demand.

Definitely try the Italian wedding soup - But otherwise every dish or pizza I have had has been the best Italian in the area.

They also do not serve alcohol but you can BYOB.  Run nextdoor to the convenient store!  Don't forget to hit the ATM too."}
{"text":"Ok, I have waited a long time to review Guidos because it is my favorite food of all time and I really wanted to commit to this review.  Here we go.  Guidos food is by far and away my last meal-but what to order would be so hard!  Everything on the menu is amazing!  They are known for their incredible pizza (which it is) but there is so much more to the menu.  I think what really sets guidos apart from everyone else is their quality ingredients.  They use only the best on everything from beginning to end.
I always start with the salad and rolls.  Their house dressing is out of this world- I love to dip my rolls in it.  The rolls are straight from the heavens.  Crunchy, crispy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside. They used incredible cheese on their salads that really makes it super delicious.  Like I said their pizza is magnificent.  Guidos pizza is a thicker crust and shaped in a square.  I love the sausage, mushroom pepperoni.  Their sausage is the star of the dish.  I never get sausage on my pizza elsewhere because I hate those ball of sausage- that is not the case at Guidos.  It is chunks of homemade sausage and I can never get enough.  Guidos sauce is wonderful.  No chunkies, no sugar- just straight sauce.  Possibly the best thing about Guidos is their meatballs. Made from what I think is a meat mixture that includes veal, pork and beef.  They are huge and are the best meatballs ever hands down.  They can be enjoyed on the Meatball sub which come on a toasted hoogie style bun covered in that high quality cheese or enjoyed atop a heaping pile of pasta.  I would suggest both ways :)  Another favorite of mine is their baked macaroni.  It is a combination of penne pasta and chunks of meatballs covered in cheese and then baked- yeah- it is as good as it sounds.  Their veal parm, chicken parm are tremendous as well- either the sub sandwich or entrees.  Lasanga, meat ravoli- everything on the menu is terrific.  
Nothing fancy about the decor- just a charming little family operated local gem.  I am so incredibly lucky to live within two miles of Guidos.  I bought my house in proximity to Guidos- no joke! Over three generations of family work at Guidos and they could not be nicer.  I always love picking up my food and be greeted by name with smiles.  Take out or eat in we do both all the time.  The dining room is pretty small so you may have to wait a few minutes to be seated. I think it is a romantic date to eat there- plus the pizza is better right out of the oven.  
The only downsides- they only take cash- they are not open for lunch- they are not open on Sundays.  Small price to pay for the many, many upsides.  Do yourself a favor- drop everything and go to Guidos!"}
{"text":"The best pizza any where.  We've taken it to Iowa on dry ice for family that miss having it."}
{"text":"We went to the \"new\" Guidos late on a Saturday afternoon.  It was quiet so no wait.  We ordered the Minestrone soup, a pizza and the eggplant parmegani.  The service was okay.  But the food was really disappointing. The minestrone was more pasta than vegetable, the pizza base was far too bready i.e. stodgy and the eggplant Parmesan had no real flavor  and the coffee was cold.  Was also surprised to find no gluten free options. We really won't go back there."}
{"text":"24 years of dining here and we have never had a bad meal or bad service. Pizza is alway perfect, cavatelli are amazing and the house salad and dressing are a must. Have also had catering for large events and again everything was perfect. A true family run business where the guests are treated like family."}
{"text":"We used to live in Chesterland many years ago, and now when we return to northeast Ohio we always go there for the sausage sandwich. It is the best. Homemade bread, sauce and sausage. One is enough for two adults, and man is it good. See you next summer."}
{"text":"Excellent food individually prepared, large portions and fair prices.  Besides that the owners and staff treat us and all other customers as members of their family.  This is truly a feel good experience."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for over fifty years and have enjoyed every meal made for me. The roll are delicious. They come hot the table with pads of butter underneath. You have several choice dishes to choose from. My personal favorites have been, of course, their pizza. My other favorites consist of the chicken Parmesan. A whole breaded chicken pounded flat, dipped ok breading and deep fried. Payed in a dish where Guidos famous sauce is spooned out on top. Along with the meal you a side salad and small child's side of pasta. Other favorite include bake rigatoni. Pasta is cooked and put into a baking dish with cheese and meat along with their sauce. Then it's thrown in to their oven with more cheese on and baked. Now of course their is their world famous pizza. All different variations you can think off. When I die, I want a large pepperoni on put in my casket. Anyways, say to Mike and look to see if the old man is there. Tell him how nice the place looks since they've move."}
{"text":"Been going well over 30 years. Used to love it. But honestly, the new place is awful. Had a table full of people on my birthday. The pizza and the homemade spaghetti were great but the Chicken Parm, the veal parm, the eggplant parm and the chicken milinase were not edible. Would not fee it to my dog! Now if it was only one person complaining I would over look it. But my whole table was in agreement as we tasted each others food. The waitress was very nice and stated that she believed our food was overcooked and graciously brought us all new food. But, the new food was awful too. I do not feel it was overcooked. It tasted like soapy, dirty dishwasher water. It was as iff the dishwasher was broken. The waitress took it all away and we asked for our check. Then some short, old, mean lady came from the kitchen and told us: \"I was in the back when you returned your food and I tasted it all and it's all fine\". That is gross! She tasted our food??? Then to argue with long standing customers. It was not taken off our bill and I assure you we will NEVER go back. Birthday ruined. YUCK!"}
{"text":"We went there on. Saturday night with a table for 9.  It was very busy.  We were seated as expected; with a booth plus a table connected to it.  My first time there.  Food was plentiful and very tasty.  I had the small chx parm; still had enough for another meal.  The only negative; and it is minimal.... They need more vegetables."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites. Absolutely delicious food.  Pricing is not great but reasonable. Definitely worth it. The sausage pizza is better than anywhere else."}
{"text":"Having worked in Chester since I was a kid, very familiar with guido's, new restaurant very nice food just ok, sauce very average, I have worked in one of the best Italian rest. Ever and this place doesn't do Italian food justice"}
{"text":"This is one of the best traditional, family owned, pizza restaurants around.  Everything is home made, even the sausage."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Best house dressing in the world. I've been going here for 20 years, and the quality has never changed. But, I must say, if you enjoy Ragu brand pasta sauce, this place probably isn't for you. This is classic Italian the way it should be."}
{"text":"I absolutely HATE that they do not take credit or debit. Makes me wonder what they are doing with all that cash... Regardless! The pizza is delicious and the only food item I have had from this establishment. But on the bright side, I don't feel like I need to eat anything else because the pizza is so bomb. For real, let me reiterate that: PIZZA IS BOMB. They even have fresh delicious garlic as a topping choice. Yummm."}
{"text":"Great local place.  Pizza is good, crispy and worth the price.  Love the fact that you can bring in your own beer and wine.  Staff is efficient if not always polished and professional.  Ambiance is a little sterile.  Looking forward to the new digs next store."}
{"text":"I am writing this review while fighting back tears; my husband and I came to Guido's for lunch after attending a funeral for a very dear friend.  The service ended around lunchtime, Guido's was one of her favorite restaurants (we got a gift card for her and her husband just a few months ago for their 50th wedding anniversary), so it seemed appropriate.

This is a seat-yourself, pay with cash place, and we were greeted right away.  Our server brought water and beverages, and took our order, and we reminisced about the last time we were here -- actually, it was in their old, itty-bitty diner place; their new building is beautiful.

The rolls are so good;  I would have been happy with those and my salad with Guido's house dressing, which is lovely.  Then our pizza arrived; The Works, all hot and steamy and cheesy.  I took a corner piece, cut a bite (this is fork and knife pizza), and put it into my mouth.  Oh, my, it is SO good!  I finished that piece, took a second and savored it, and, to my husband's surprise, enjoyed a third.  I am looking forward to enjoying one of the leftover pieces.

Comfort comes in many forms;  remembering with friends, being reminded of God's faithfulness, and sometimes also with good food.  Thank you, Guido's, for the service and sustenance;  you ministered to us without even knowing it."}
{"text":"This place is high volume/calories and not great taste in exchange for too much dinero. That's it. Every positive review on Yelp emphasizes the volume the yelper got (well almost every review) That is S. A. D. It has some ok food. But I don't judge my food quality by pound."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to Guido's since before I was born. Every time we have the whole gang together there has to be Guido's pizza involved. Obviously with the expansion my family is not alone in our love for Guido's. My favorites are just the classic sausage, pepperoni and mushroom pizzas. Can't go wrong with that. My family also loves the eggplant parmesan. Will never stop coming here!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed.... we were looking forward to eating at Guidos with our kids (it was their Papa's favorite and they've never experienced it!) on Saturday night after skiing. We arrived at 9:17 and despite the posted hours of 10a-10p on Fridays and Saturdays, we were turned away, told they were no longer seating. We were given the option of ordering to go but that's not what we came for! Beautiful new building (I didn't even know they had built and initially went to the plaza where they were previously located). Long and short, if the dining room closes 45 minutes before actually closing, that should also be posted."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Guido's since I was a baby. It was my dad's favorite restaurant. They use to have a really small diner location, but they upgraded to a larger location that suites them well. Still a very homey and friendly place. They give you so much food! Eating leftovers for days and they taste as good as the first day. The sauce is amazing! You can't go wrong eating here and everything on the menu is excellent! They even let you bring in your own wine! Love supporting the family that owns this place, they really have such great service and food!"}
{"text":"Was there on 12-6-15 for the first time and I must say it was really good.  The service was great and quality of the food was good and the serving sizes were very satisfying.  I would have given it 5 stars but hey do not except credit cards."}
{"text":"I grew up in Chesterland  and the last time I was here it was 15+ years ago.  It was okay back then...

NOW..  new building and fresh decor.  Very nice.  Still a bit small.  

The pizza was good, nice thick crust generous with the toppings good sauce.  I enjoyed it.

Manacotti... I was expecting homemade noodles.  Made me a little sad.   The ricotta filling was okay, good sauce and meatballs were okay too.  

The prices are a tad high for the quality of food.  I'm hoping they increase the quality and get a liquor license.  Or at least beer/wine.  (Had to stop at convienent next door to get some beer..  beer and pizza go hand in hand)"}
{"text":"Been there many times, prices are higher but food is very good.. Its like a special thing when wanted great pizza  and great spaghetti but bring CASH cause they don' t take credit cards.. Uncle same getting his? LOL, hmm  well I will be returning to this place many times..."}
{"text":"It was busy when we got there, but still were sat within only 5 minutes! We were greeted by our server Rachael, I believe, who brought us water and fresh rolls right away. Our rolls were the perfect crunch on the outside and soft warm inside. They know their bread!

They are a BYOB/ CASH ONLY establishment BUT there is wide selection of alcohol right next door and an ATM  right in the building.

The pizza was fresh, hot, and cheesy. Pleasingly different from other pizza places I have been to.
The crust was very tasty. The sauce was addicting. The cheese was perfect.

It was a great experience from start to finish.

Though it was cash only and I was charged $2.50 from the ATM and another $2.50 from Chase bank to take out $20.00, I liked that this establishment donated their ATM fee profits to charity.

I tipped the server 20% and we left with a box of pizza to go.

Tip: Bring Cash and Beer/wine with you."}
{"text":"Been eating here all my life. When i come home for a visit this is my first stop after leaving the airport. Salad w/Cheese House Dressing, Chicken Cutlet Sandwich w/Cheese and their rolls. Cant go wrong with anything on their menu..... Only problem They don't ship to Los Angeles..."}
{"text":"I just don't know why everyone is making such a big deal about this place. I've had way better Italian food. I think their pizza's crust is too thick, but not thick enough (or tasty enough) to be considered deep dish. So you basically eat a ton of dough with some toppings.
I was underwhelmed by other dishes we tried. The eggplant was super greasy, and the pasta was no better than the 5 minutes pasta with sauce I make at home.
I also think they're totally overpriced; but their servings are big, they're meant for sharing, so I suppose that justifies some of the high pricing. Still, our bill was huge and we didn't enjoy the food all that much."}
{"text":"The best pasta sauce I have ever enjoyed!  Try the eggplant parm, thinly sliced with the amazing sauce.  Don't miss this place, it will become a favorite!"}
{"text":"We visited this location after receiving a gift card from a friend, and were looking for a casual night out. This place is incredible - the ONLY reason for 4 stars is because I wish they accepted credit/debit cards. 

We shared a large cheese pizza and it encompassed everything you want in a pie: the perfect ratio of cheese/crust/sauce, no grease (amen!) and the stringy pull of the cheese was something from a commercial. The best part? We took the second half home for bonus pizza the next day. 

Staff is attentive, quick and most importantly - want to make sure that you're loving every moment of your experience. It's the kind of restaurant where you could sit around the table for hours. Can't wait to go back!"}
