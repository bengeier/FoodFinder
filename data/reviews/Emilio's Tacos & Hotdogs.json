{"text":"I got the asada & grilled chicken street tacos, they were delicious! My dad got the chicken burrito & loved it. The sopapilas were to die for. Good food. Family owned & the family is super sweet! Great job guys  will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The best.  I am happy that their menu is short and to the point. I was scared that it'll be another -berto style place but it is actually legit."}
{"text":"Great place and extremely friendly staff. I loved my Sonoran hotdog and pastor taco, they were both delicious. My Cabeza taco was tasty also but a little more gristle than I'm use to. I will defiantly come back and try everything else they have to offer. I would recommend everyone try this place."}
{"text":"Food was good for the price . I highly recommended a visit . Authentic Mexican food. Got me chicken tacos and the quesadillas were excellent and juicy!!"}
{"text":"SO good. My husband and I decided to try this place on a whim today and we are so glad we did. We ordered tacos, nachos and a Sonoran hotdog, our total was under $20 and the food was delicious. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food, very good customer service. Definitely going back.

The Carne asada was awesome!"}
{"text":"I have recently seen this taco and hot dog shop open and any kind of Sonoran hot dogs come in the form of food trucks rather than a stand alone location like this place ! They do also have a drive- thru for more as a convenience. Since this is my first visit I felt that going with the stapled Sonoran hot dog wrapped in bacon with condiments of guacamole sauce, beans, onions, and tomatoes was new to me.
The three rolled tacos with guacamole was the other meal I ordered. The flavors were definitely authentic and the meal did take some time to being prepared, but all worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I give this Place a 5 stars. As many times this location has changed names/ownership, I hope this one stays.This is my favorite out of them all!  There chicken tacos and rice and beans are so good!! I would like to try everything on the menu to give out more recommendation. I definitely recommend this place to family and friends!!"}
{"text":"Gem! Love this place- you pay when your done ordering, and with food this good you might have a few trips."}
{"text":"Super great place! Clean, friendly, unique, amazing and food! What more do you need?! We ordered pastor, chicken, and asada tacos. ALL were very yummy and had a ton of flavor. We also got two Sonoran dogs, I would say that it is a MUST to try. Trust me, you'll understand why when that dog touches your lips. We will definitely be back and will be taking friends and family to this new gem!"}
{"text":"Great hard tacos and the street tacos are also very good. Hot dogs are amazing the bun they use is incredible. Already been back several times in the last week."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!!!

The rolled tacos and Sonoran style hotdogs were great!

Make sure to try the green sauce!

The owner is super nice and will take good care of you!"}
{"text":"First time here. Carne asada fries are the bomb. Both the boys had the hotdogs and said they were awesome. We will be back! Price point is great! A new neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"First time here and I gotta say, this good is amazing. It's a mixture of fastfood, but restaurant style... Definitely worth coming by to eat something."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to write a review because I want this place all to myself!! One word: RIQU√çSIMO. If you go, DEFINITELY get the Sonoran dog. BACON WRAPPED dog with beans, cheese, sour cream, tomato... ugh I ate it so quickly that I'm hungry again just typing this. Our first time in, we were impressed with the quality of service and cleanliness for such a small place. Very cute on the inside. Second time we went through the drive thru and it did not disappoint. Just as delicious as we remember. If the food takes over 5 min to make.. THATS A GOOD SIGN!!! They care about their food and the service. So lucky to live walking distance from this spot!"}
{"text":"My buddy at work told me about this new taco shop he saw.  He said he was going to check it out, and if it was good, he would bring me some tacos.  So I'm sitting there at work on Friday, and here comes Joel with a bag of tacos.  Score!

He got me 3 carne asada street tacos.  I opened the styrofoam container and they smelled delicious!  Small, street taco style, double corn tortillas.  The carne asada was legit!  Cubed up, not greasy, tender, and tasted delicious!  They were topped with onion, cillantro and some guacamole.  These were some legit street tacos, and some of the best I have encountered in the Phoenix area!  3 was a good lunch, but I could have definitely ate about 3 more.  They were good! 

If the tacos were this good, I will definitely be back there soon in order to try out their other food.  It's close to work, and I was very impressed at first taste.  Good stuff!"}
