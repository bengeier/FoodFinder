{"text":"We had a great dinner with friends. The service was top notch, very attentive. Food was excellent, the cod was my favourite but the short ribs vanished pretty quickly too! Sometimes with sharing style restaurants I am left feeling like I have to fight for my share but the portions were generous and more importantly easy to share. No awkward chopstick disections or boorish stabbings to divy the food up. On a recommendation we tried a reisling which I quite liked but our friend did not. The wine was happily taken back and something different was brought out. It did seem as if they were running low on things, dessert was unavailable and they were out of a few of the white wines on the menu.
We got there for 8:00 and the place was half full. By the time we were making our way out into the torrential rain the place was getting packed."}
{"text":"The better half and I tried out KOKO for dinner on Friday night, and unfortunately I can only give the experience 3 stars.  I have to admit, this was a one time experience, so perhaps they were simply having a bad night, but to echo a previous yelp-er, it was overall pretty underwhelming.

Maybe because it was Friday of the Hallowe'en weekend, and they couldn't find enough people to staff the restaurant?  Maybe it was just our bad luck?  But at 7:30 or so with only two other tables, we waited 45+ for our appy.  And we were pretty disappointed when it arrived - the soft shelled crab was rather overly breaded/crusted before deep-frying, and it was barely warm.  Not sure if it sat out for a long time, but the waitresses (yes, two of them, for one table of two eating, one table of two waiting (us!), and one table of two just arrived), were not swamped!  Waitresses were friendly and eager, so not sure where the ball dropped....

Main dishes were better, hot and tasty.  We had the black cod and short ribs.  Flavours and textures were wonderful, the restaurant's saving grace!  Small point: I was a little irked by the asparagus that came with the cod:  4 stringy, ice-cold pieces.  Not sure it was a garnish (but they looked very sad: limp, charred, soggy)... but it was my first time leaving asparagus behind!

The menu appeared to consist of pretty run of the mill Japanese OR Korean foods, not a modern fusion twist which I had expected.  Drinks list showed inventive cocktails and martinis...  Oh, and share bar, means family style, sharing the plates.  Sizes are significantly bigger than tapas!  Decor and ambiance were lovely, hip, modern, cool.

The meal came to $70 for quickie dinner of one appy, one beer, two mains, taxes.  Keep in mind we brought small appetites to the restuarant (one of us came from happy hour).  I know it's Yorkville location adds a premium, but given our experience, not sure if we will be returning.  Might come back to try cocktails....  might be a fun place for someone to bring a date...."}
{"text":"Not sure why some people are giving a review of a tapas place for 
serving tapas style (come on, it's called \"share\" bar). 

If you go to a tapas place and expect you can order one dish and serve 4 people with it then you can't fault the restaurant. They didn't make you stupid. You walked in that way. Why don't you just ask your server what they recommend portion wise instead of just ordering like an idiot and then faulting the restaurant?

I thought the portions would be smaller but each main was ample. Had the black cod and the short ribs (split between the two of us after apps, we were stuffed). Both were amazing from the 
presentation to the last bite. Didn't try their maki, sashimi, but would love to next time - the sushi pizza was great. I'd love to see more inventive appetizers round out their menu. 

Server was polite, very knowledgeable and took cues to know when to interrupt the table and when not to. 

Liked the decor but it's a little spartan and, while they make great use of their space, it's still unfortunate that the resto is below street level. Would love to see Koko grow into a bigger location.

Left my first visit here very happy and knowing that I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the \"share bar\" label; they seem to have dropped the concept? I also think they might have lessened the whole 'tapas' angle in favour of a more traditional dining experience, which is probably a step in the right direction, according to previous reviews; they've kept the food and service, but lost the pretension. 

  I and a friend stopped in here randomly for a bite before the theater, and while the service lagged a little bit, everyone was very friendly and eager to help. The space is small, well furnished and cozy- when I was there they were having some kind of an issue with the Ladies' washroom, so I had to make do with the Gents' (not that there's much of a difference in single-serve bathrooms anyways).

We started off with a lovely pot of tea (green with scented rice and popcorn, I think) and a glass of pinot grigio. I had a seaweed salad ($8) which was very beautifully made and extremely delicious- very small, but just right for one person as an appetizer. I also had the PEI Mussels with gochujang butter ($19), which were fantastic and of a standard mussel serving size. All the flavours were well balanced and the staging was just beautiful; they've taken a lot of care to make sure that the dinnerware is attractive. My friend had the bulgogi bibimbap, which she enjoyed a lot. It was a little pricey, but not unexpected; it's Yorkville, after all. 

All in all, it was a really nice, cozy experience; the food was excellent and the staff were very sweet."}
{"text":"the bulgogi bibimbap is very delicious,but
 white rice is too little?"}
{"text":"It was my first time, and will be my ABSOLUTE LAST time ordering food from here.  

I was craving for some sort of Asian food and figured maybe because of the price being on the more expensive side and the images looked good that it might at least tasted decent.  But, that was far from the truth.    I refrain from ordering sushi because I know there are only a handful of places in the city that does amazing sushi. Therefore, I order a Tofu Bibimbop takeout for lunch thinking you can't mess up on bibimbop.  But, I was wrong--you can, and the quality was no way worth the valued I paid.  I was extremely disappointed.  I had order bibimbop takeout from other places and this was nowhere near comparable to the many bibmbop I had.   Based on this experience, I have very little faith that any other dish would taste amazing.   Sending a warning that you might be disappointed for you you get and pay for."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was excellent! I had some sashimi (very fresh), the kimchi trio (heaven for a kimchi lover), and the vegetable, dumpling & egg soup (hit the spot).
I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Lived in Korea, Japan; have traveled extensively, and love food, especially appreciate it when \"thought and care\" go into making dishes, and yes, I cook.

Having said that...we arrived in Toronto for the weekend and missed the lunch rush, began wandering around Yorkville to have lunch.  We passed by KoKo and decided to go in because my son always wants Asian food.  Now, as a Korean when I see Korean / Japanese restaurants the thoughts that come to mind are 1) it has to be a Korean owner, no self respecting Japanese sushi chef would dream of doing Japanese/Korean  or Japanese/ any other country specific food, 2) the Japanese food must be the type that Americans think are amazing,not any Asian food connoisseur who knows their rolls/ sushi/ sashimi, and 3) the Korean food is either too salty or too sweet.

Very pleasantly surprised...
Service:  was great, but we did eat lunch at 2:30 and we were the only ones in the restaurant.  The chef came and said hello.

Korean, lemon, honey, ginger tea:  amazing! My mother used to make this for me as a child, I have never seen it served in a N. American restaurant.  Ginger was extremely fresh and served in a great cast iron tea kettle ( which is what I use to steep my very expensive teas at home).  Small critique:  the tea should have been served hotter.

Salad:  ok, I'm going to go on and on about the salad. My husband who does not eat anything that is not brown or is not considered flesh finished his salad.  Fresh, not wilted spring mix, and the dressing was amaze!   I hate Asian restaurants that serve iceberg lettuce with a slice of cuke and carrot and drenched in that over sweet orangey color ginger dressing. This dressing was white, extremely light and refreshing and  the simple ingredients were in perfect balance with each other.  They wouldn't tell me the ingredients, but I think it was rice wine vinegar, fresh grated ginger, mayo and sugar.

California roll and spicy tuna roll: very good, the tuna was fresh, but the reason that l liked it was because the rice was very well seasoned (vinegar) and the consistency of the rice was perfect, more importantly, there was a perfect thin consistent layer of rice around the seaweed.  This is a skill.  There should not be two inches of rice on a roll, the rice is not the star of a roll, most restaurants do not have the skill to roll the rice so thin, and use it as a filler, with a ton of rice and little filling.  So, nice to get a quality roll.

Lunch entree: spicy pork, LA Kalbi, and chirashi.   spicy pork was very flavorful ( and I don't mean MSG flavorful), it was cooked perfectly.  Kalbi was extremely tender, I don't know how they cooked it so tender they must tenderize the meat somehow.  LA Kalbi is not an easy cut to cook because it is not a tender cut and if it is undercooked it can be chewy and if over cooked it will be dry.  The chirashi was fresh,I didn't taste it but the cuts of maguro and other sashimi looked fresh.  Small critique:  seasoning was almost perfect...my personal palate desires less salt. My husband thought the salt content was fine.

Price: was $80 we did have a large kirin lager. The portions didn't personally bother me, because it's not a \"gorge\" yourself restaurant.  The items we ordered all used fresh and good quality ingredients and I don't mind paying more  for same.  The only critique with regards to portion was the rice, they could have given a full bowl of rice, but if your watching ur carbs, then it's a plus.  You are in Yorkville, so I am sure that the prices are going to be more expensive. If you want cheap, huge portioned, MSG laden Korean Japanese food, go to Yonge St."}
{"text":"I expected higher prices because of location, but with that I also hope for something a bit better. The food was just okay. Our table ordered Chirashi, an assortment of rolls and the Bossam dish. Portions were rather small and in particular, I'd advise against ordering the Hotate roll - considering the price and it being listed under the \"Signature Modern Roll\" section, I thought it'd look less like a maki. 

On the bright side of things, the servers were very, very nice especially considering we had a large group of 10+. And its a comfortable place to eat unlike some of the other restaurants in the area that are a bit stuffy. Perhaps, the other korean dishes are better than the sushi/sashimi options."}
{"text":"We were huge fans of the Japanese restaurant that was formerly in this location, so decided to continue the tradition of stopping midday for an asian lunch between boutique hopping (Sprezzy is a dedicated Holt's shopper, after all) and try KOKO .We love sushi and I have a fondness for Korean, so we had hope that this might become a favorite. 

Our last lunch left us most unimpressed. We ordered a roll with tuna in it and had to send it back because the tuna was -- ewww -- brown. After said roll was returned to be remade we were informed that the chef sears the tuna first always. Heh? Who the hell makes a tuna roll with cooked fish?! Also, the boyf hated an orange colored  sauce (mayo? french dressing?)  they liberally applied. By that time my mediocre beef bulgogi had been sitting out to cool, and had become cold, tough bulgogi. Not good. 

It's a shame because the interior is quite nice -- I love the gorgeous varnished wood tables, the authentic chopsticks in wooden boxes and the small, Tokyo-like interior.
Who knows, maybe one day  it'll revert back to a cute, little Japanese mom & pop place that makes their own soy sauce like the former residents."}
{"text":"Sorry. I've been exposed to amazing Korean foods since I was young but this is a joke. Appetizers are basically banchans you get free at Korean restaurants but I wouldn't mind paying if they are amazing, which wasn't the case. We shared galbi, lobster bibimbop and seafood hot pot. They were not terrible but I didn't enjoy them either. I felt so bad for my friend whom I dragged since I wanted to check out the restaurant. And how did we spend $150 here??? We didn't eat much but we ended up paying too much."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere - at least at lunch.  Service is friendly, and the food very tasty and a good value (especially for Yorkville)"}
{"text":"Great little hidden place in yorkville!  I went here for a meeting with some co-workers.  For appetizers we had these delicious little gyoza dumplings.  Yes these gyoza dumplings are at every japanese place but these ones are extra tiny and cripsy which I like!  For the main course I had the beef bulgogi.  It comes in a steaming hot bowl neatly arranged with all the ingredients...beef, rice, schredded vegetables and bean sprouts.  Your supppose to mix everything together while its hot!  It was Delish!   My friend got the korean short ribs.  The portion was huge!  I now understand why it's called share bar!  It's really too much for one person! The restaurant is a cross between japanese and korean. The owners are really nice.  They gave us the big table at the front of the restaurant even though it was dinner time and there was only 3 of us.  Good experience overall!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch place in Yorkville. My co-workers and I frequently come here for bibimbap (veg, kimchi, avocado, bulgogi, chicken) because the bowls are delicious, the right size (for lunch), come quickly, and are not super expensive. The best part: they always manage to get the crispy rice just perfect! 

It's also rare to have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"First time I tried bibimbap was here, and I fell in love. Lived on west coast so used to good fresh food. Sushi is good here too! This is one of my favorite restaurants in Tdot!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok to me. Been twice now and no need to go back. If you want great Korean food, try Tofu Village on Bloor."}
{"text":"Located in the center of Yorkville, KOKO! Share Bar is a welcoming, warm and  clean place for dinner.   The menu is fairly simple with a nice selection of appetizers, sushi and a few main courses.   For a team of two we had two appetizers (octopus and soft shell crab), the glazed black cod and the scallop modern sushi roll.  I have to admit, the best dish was the glazed black cod which is always a great treat to have but I found the other dishes falling short of its mark.   The octopus just seemed to hard and it was deep fried which I felt lost the flavors of the dish.   I did enjoy the soft shell crab which I would definitely order again.   The last was the scallop sushi roll, it didn't wow me and it's not what I would order again but I think all in all the meal was just enough to fill your appetite.   I would definitely recommend coming here for something simple and light but not if you're hoping for a filling meal.     It's definitely a nice cozy place for a drink and snack."}
{"text":"Overall:
Recently went here for a family dinner. I wasn't expecting much and sadly, I should have expected even less. Save yourself and go a little farther north where the real Korean food is for 1/4 of the price.

A breakdown--

Food: 
Gyoza - fried to a crisp with barely anything as the filling.

Rolls - Both the lobster and soft shell crab in the rolls we had were stale. Either they left them out too long or they lazily cooked them before rolling them up. Pretty disappointing. At least it was a good amount.

Bibimbap - this is the first bibimbap where I thought my rice was going to light on fire given how fast it charred. It was also tasteless. Enough said.

Service: 
We were pretty hungry and it was busy so we wanted to order everything at once. The staff had other ideas, insisting we order drinks and appetizers separately first. Only then could we proceed to order mains. Only after pleading a few times did we finally get to order our food. Not sure the logic of having your customers go through hoops to be able to order.

Price:
At these prices, you expect something more. I understand it's Yorkville so there's a premium but even then, this was over the top for a few rolls and some bibimbap."}
{"text":"The physical space is quite small. But the ambience was light, cheerful and pleasant. The quality of food was absolutely superb. You can tell that everything in the dish was meticulously seasoned, and put together. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came to KOKO for lunch service on a late Friday afternoon. 

Ordered two lunch dishes (miso soup and salad with ginger dressing included):

15 PIECE SASHIMI AND RICE (5/10) - Sashimi platter was an assortment of salmon, white tuna and red tuna. Pieces were unevenly cut and didn't taste fresh. The fish tasted like it has been sitting in the fridge for a while. 

SPICY CHICKEN AND VEGETABLES WITH RICE (5/10) - Chicken slivers stir fried in sweet and spicy sauce. The sauce reminded me of the Korean hot sauce you put into a bimbimbap. The dish should really be called Spicy chicken and rice since two pieces of carrot and onion strips wouldn't be classified as \"and vegetable\" in my books. 

Rating Summary: 

Food: 5/10 - Food was mediocre and sashimi wasn't the most fresh

Atmosphere: 7/10 -Nestled in the heart of Yorkville, clean, modern décor, moderate amount of seating, no background music

Service: 5/10 - Water service needs improvement, slow service for a lunch hour, and hot food arrived cold. 

I wouldn't recommend coming here for lunch if you expect to be serviced quickly. Took 45 minutes from time of ordering to when our first dish came out. Several tables around us noted orders were not correct and food came out cold. 

There seemed to have been only two people working, one server and one cook. The cozy restaurant was fairly busy and knowing that this restaurant has been in existence for few years I'd think management would be able to staff accordingly for the anticipated lunch traffic.

Likely will go to elsewhere for Korean/ Japanese food in the future."}
{"text":"Nothing special, despite the fact this restaurant is nestled in the heart of yorkville, the menu choice is not exciting and expensive compare to other Korean/Japanese style restaurant. I ordered the spicy seafood hot pot for $22, all the seafood in the broth (shrimp, scallop, mussel) are over-cooked and tastes like rubber. The service was good, but that was the only good thing they got going for them. I got a coupon on livingsocial, but I don't think I will revisit with or without a coupon."}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet. 

I was here on a date a little while back and ordered the japchae and the bibimbap. We were both pretty pleased with our food which was great because we were a little restricted in terms of what we could order because of some food allergies. The food was good, nothing to rave about though especially considering the price.

The waitress was very nice and gave us recommendations for sake and chatted with us. We actually stayed until the place was closing since they didn't have anyone waiting which the staff were very gracious about.

Pros: 
- cool vibe
- great staff

Cons:
- price

Would come back to try the share plates."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review.

The 2 standouts for KOKO! Share Bar - the amazingly friendly and engaging service, and the warm, cozy decor (the wood on the ceiling and some of the walls is refurbished from a barn in Peterborough, so I hear...).  We were pretty much the first people at the restaurant that evening, and we were given the same spiel that all diners were when they entered about this being a share bar, so sit anywhere and share!  By the time we left, the restaurant wasn't yet full and of all the groups we saw,  no one group had chosen to sit with another.  I would say that while the idea of a share bar experience is an interesting one, it's probably still going to take some time to get use to in this area of town.

Besides drinks, on our menu were the L.A. style ribs, Beef Tenderloin 'Tosa-Style' signature modern rolls with seaweed and rice on the side.  I have a bias for kalbi as I simply love them, and more often then not, I have intense cravings for them especially at bbqs in the summer.  As such, while the L.A, style ribs were delicious, I felt that that it was over priced for what it was and nothing really special that I couldn't get at any other Korean bbq place.  The rolls were pretty and innovative.  The seaweed was a disappointment - too sweet, too warm, not crunchy enough.  I've had better at sushi buffets.  

In sum with a miscellaneous thought: 
I've got to say it again, the service is very good at this restaurant.  I think there's room for improvement for the menu quality.  The washrooms seem like they were leftover from whichever establishment occupied the space before and doesn't match the rest of the place, which is trendy, modern, and hopefully, not over-hyped."}
{"text":"Very expensive for the type and quality of food served here. Our group of 3 had drinks and apps before dinner and it came up to $60++ (we each had 1 drink and only had a couple of appetizers to share between us).

I love tapas and i love korean food...you're better off in Koreatown or a real tapas bar. I can't justify paying entree prices and getting tapa sizes"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my cousin today and I ordered the lobster bibimbap and she had the beef bulgogi. 

The food was very bland and incredibly over priced. Atmosphere was good and service good. Food sucked. Definitely not like a traditional Korean restaurant, where the food is much better and tastier and the prices are way less expensive. 

My cousin's order wasn't so great either. \"This doesn't taste so great, but at least I'm eating healthy\" was her comment to the very low low sodium levels in both our dishes. 

Overall, my experience was ok. I wouldn't go back. 

Cheers."}
{"text":"Never even got to try the food here as the customer service was horrible. Went there for a birthday dinner that was prepaid for by the birthday girls sister and was charged the full amount prior to the dinner. The rest of the party was late and the staff had no problem with that as the payment was already processed. Once the remainder of the party arrived the staff then decided not to serve us because \"they can't process any transactions without the cardholder there\" although they spoke to the cardholder when making the reservation and again a few minutes prior to the guests arriving to verify everything AND already charged the full amount. They told us we could pay individually for what we order and they would later refund the hundreds already paid earlier that day. Was super frustrating and sad for the birthday girl. They shouldn't of charged us firstly and wasted to much of our time. Went to another resturant down the road was so much better than this place could ever of been.
The food there wouldn't even be worth it. Literally got on yelp to write my first review cause it was that bad."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner and was not disappointed!! I was a bit apprehensive because the reviews were not great but i was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant. I loved the sashimi, the plum wine and the bibimbap and also the service was great. Would come back here."}
{"text":"Quick bite on a Friday just before we head to the Varsity to catch a flick.

Ordered Chirashi and sashimi lunches.  Cozy tiny spot with neighbours very close to you on either side. That's how we heard the very awkward performance review feedback convo next to us .  The guy was terrible at giving feedback as he did all the talking and the poor woman was silent. He would benefit from a leader training course or two.

Food was good and service was fine if a bit slow for lunch."}
{"text":"I was scared to ask for more rice.

I'm surprised by how positive the reviews are for KOKO! Share Bar. I wasn't overwhelmed by either the service or food. What I did enjoy was the live band, which happens every Wednesday night. 

Food: 
At first glance, you think, wow what a great price for such innovative, delicious sounding dishes. Then you order a bunch of dishes off the menu expecting it to be plenty for your group. The food arrives, much smaller than anticipated and you're thinking, oh shit, how do I ration this amongst my group of hungry friends. 

I get the whole share bar/tapas restaurant. It's not best with big groups, or if you're incredibly hungry. We knew this, but didn't expect such little portions. We were a group of six and we ordered about 8 dishes between all of us including the Bossam: A Platter of Spicy Chicken (or pork) with a side of rice (and I mean 'side' in its most literal term),  a few shreds of lettuce leaves (and by few I mean 2.5) and some sauces (enough for one dip) $50
I know it serves only two but for $50 I'd expect enough rice and lettuce to actually experience the dish as it's supposed to be eaten. We asked for some more lettuce and rice a couple times and the waitress had to check with the manager who scowled at us. Why are they stinging on their cheapest ingredients. (Oh and they charged us for the extra lettuce and rice)

However, I was impressed by the Roasted Miso Black Cod $22. Again this was a bit smaller than a normal entree size, but enough for everyone to have a small bite. Also, I love the design of the place, great space for hanging out with friends for a drink and a few bites.

Overall, I don't think the Asian tapas menu is for me. I rather enjoy being satisfied by my meal and not worrying if I'll have enough to eat for the night.

KOKO, is for someone who likes to eat in Yorkville and is looking for some interesting small tapas eats.

I apologize for sounding harsh. At least my group of friends and I have a great story out of our night there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came mid afternoon for a snack. The restaurant has a nice decor and vibe to it. The service was great and the food portion was good as well. We ordered the bibimbap and sometimes the bibimbap is all rice and little toppings. KOKO has more toppings than rice, which was a nice bonus. We enjoyed our meal. However, $20 is a little more on the expensive side.

We will only come to this place for more nicer occasions."}
{"text":"This was a nice find down the street from my hotel.  It is very casual and was pretty empty when we got there.  I thought it was Korean but it was also fairly Japanese.  I had a great glass of unfiltered saki so all was good.

The sushi was fresh and good but I've had much better.  Some of the sauces on the sashimi were way too heavy.  I guess they can learn from Sugarfish in LA, which is my favorite!   The kimchi was good and the service was attentive.

I will come back to try the Korean BBQ menu."}
{"text":"This place serves both Japanese and Korean food which isn't properly advertising. My friend and I kept it light after a heavy breakfast and lunch with Japanese: spinach gomae, avocado salad, miso soups and spicy tuna roll. All the food was amazing and fresh, particularly the fish. And the \"citrus soju infusions\" is such a tasty, fresh cocktail recommended by our lovely server Jasmine:)"}
{"text":"Koko is one of my favourite Japanese/Korean restaurants in the city. The food is consistently delicious with generous portions, and the service is always friendly.  They make a beautiful avocado salad with the most wonderful ginger dressing. The sashimi is always great. Also love the spicy wok toss and bibimbap."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for Valentine's day. I'm not sure if I'm giving it 5 stars because it was legitimately a good dining experience, or if it was the reason behind the dinner. Anyway, I ordered sushi and salmon assortment ($22) . My boyfriend ordered the lobster bibimbap ($22) . As a strong believer of quality over quantity, I don't think this restaurant is overpriced. The food was definitely fresh (the sashimi was mindblowingly delicious) and had a pleasant presentation, and the servers always had a smile on their face."}
{"text":"Came here for my friends bday dinner on Friday night. If you are desperately craving mediocre Korean/japanese food in Yorkville then try this. Otherwise, go elsewhere and expect better food at a fraction of the price. 

Pros 
- cute space
- lots of variety on the menu so perfect if dining with indecisive friends 

Cons
- most food lacked flavour / poor execution 
- pricey since we are in Yorkville 
- ordered some sushi rolls, seaweed salad and kimchi as apps. Sushi rolls were soft and soggy. Seaweed salad was good but small portions. Kimchi was not house made 
- I ordered the lobster bibimbop as the main and paid $2 extra to sub for brown rice. There was so little brown rice in my bowl and lobster was a bit overdone and doused in some sort of sweet sauce. Bibimbops at regular mom and pops are much much better."}
{"text":"Oh this is a funny little spot.
I went here for lunch a couple times for work. It was good for me to spread my wings and try the offerings of this asian fusion house.

It's a lovely space which I would expect in Yorkville. Love the choice of art and boxed chopsticks found at each table.

The food was good but not spectacular. I would say as a lunch experience in the area it is one of the better places to go. Fast, fresh and not as generic as what is around you.

Having tried the sushi, bibimbap, bulgogi bowls, gyoza and edamame I would say like many - a 3 to 3.5.  The food compared to what you'd find in even small mom and pop places in little korea is not as good.  The depth of flavour just not there but it's satisfying on a quick lunch.

Make no mistake, eating in yorkville will mean you will pay much more than any other area of the city. Take advantage of the lunch special where you get salad, miso soup and your entree for under 20.  

It's a lovely respite from all the other spaces in the area. It's a little hard to find so keep google maps hand and remember to look down as this place is at ground level."}
{"text":"Always one of my favourites when in Yorkville.  Friendly family staff/owners. Food is fresh and well prepared. The sushi is excellent but the real star is the bip im bap. Kim hi is my favourite but the bulgogi is a close second.  I learned this trip that they will combine toppings.  Look forward to trying a bulgogi kimchi combo next time. Try this place, you will glad you did."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here after equinox and it was SO delish. What a pleasant surprise. Will definitely come black and refer people here. Had the agedashi tofu, seafood pancake, dynamite roll and  beef salad. The salad was the best but everything else was really really good too."}
{"text":"I give this 5 stars because of the honesty of the  food and humble, but impeccable service in this tiny little gem in the middle of an expensive metropolis. Koko is just what you want. Great sushi, and Korean hot pot classic Bibimbap. Fucking amazing! Atmosphere is very comfy and prices are reasonable. Enjoy"}
{"text":"KOKO! Share Bar is the newest effort by restaurateur and hospitality consultant Sang Kim (Blowfish, etc), and master chef, Shin Aoyama.  The two worked together on Ki Modern Japanese, where Shin was the executive chef. 

I was lucky enough to be invited to the grand-opening where I could sample several of the dishes.  I cannot explain how lucky we are as Torontonians to have access to a talent like Aoyama.  And even though the space is small, it's designed beautifully to be warm, inviting, and intimate, which is the key to making the \"Share Bar\" concept work.  Apparently, sharing food is a major part of Korean cuisine culture, and at KOKO! you're encouraged to dip right into the plates of your dinner companions.  Being able to share the experience of every single morsel that arrives at your table is one of the most extraordinary things I have had the chance to be a part of.   The bar could perhaps use a bit more variety, even keeping within the theme, but as it's only the first week, I'm sure this will come with time.  

The service is really what makes this place special.  In a city where so many of us have had some of the worst service imaginable, Sang Kim has spent an immense amount of time hand-picking only those individuals who are the most committed to GREAT service.  In an article by Daniel Alexandre Portoraro, of martiniboys.com, he explains \"Kim put out an open call to applicants; 192 answered, and each were sent the question of 'how to make the world a better place'. 57 answered, and each of them went on a 15-minute walking interview with Kim, talking about similar questions.\" 

This will no doubt be one of Toronto's top restaurants in a very short time. I highly recommend the tuna and the butterfish.   I also highly recommend making a reservation before there's a waiting list.  ;)"}

{"text":"This restaurant is really quite a gem hidden in the Yorkville area.

Things I liked:
a) Service.  I think this has been mentioned numerous times already, but the service was truly exceptional, especially for Canada, which I found to be lacking in most restaurants.  Our waitress was attentive and helpful throughout our meal.
b) Seafood Hot Pot.  The soup was very rich and packed with signature Korean flavours.  There were plenty of seafood and the scallops were cooked perfectly... shrimps were definitely overcooked, but we can overlook that ;)
c) Decor.  The restaurant is small and cozy, combined with the decor, it created a very welcoming atmosphere; not too dark, not too bright.

Things I did not like:
a) Appetizers.  The appetizers were somewhat lacking in my opinion, and we ended up not ordering anything from it.
b) Coffee.  The coffee was disappointingly bland.  I would not order this again.

Overall, a very pleasant experience, and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to my beloved Toronto, I happened upon this little basement gem and then returned 3 or 4 times because I liked the vibe of the restaurant and the style of food so much.   

The service team are all nice. The various bowls are all great. I enjoyed their spicy seafood bouillabaisse. Even the sushi is terrific, but Koko's obvious crown jewel is their Koko Korean Bibimbap which is rice, vegetables and meat served in a sizzling stone dish which can be any of a variety of meats.  The rice gets crusted against the stone serving dish which enhances the texture of the dish. It's great tasting, but good showmanship also. It's fun to watch the whole restaurant's patrons visually following the server as they bring this dish out.   

If Toronto weather is cold, I've got bad news and good news. The bad news is that Koko has a definite draft coming in from the front door so choose wisely for seating although to be frank, it's a small restaurant with few choices. They try to make up for it with strategically located space heaters. The good news is that their various bowls and soup style dishes here will all warm you to your bones.  

This place is great. I'll definitely return on future trips for sure, and I even got my business partner liking it even though he prefers big fancy expensive restaurants."}
{"text":"Small but nice setting, and some original, tasty and well presented meals. Nice staff and service in addition. You may still be hungry at the end of your dinner, for sure, but it may worth it to try and go there once in a while and to change from the regular sushi's places. I agree it is a little over priced however."}
{"text":"Koko! Share Bar is aesthetically pleasing, clean and service is spot on :) My friend and I ordered the seafood hot pot, spider roll and pork belly ssam- all super fresh and delicious. Would definitely come back! :)"}
{"text":"Cozy and someone romantic ambience, friendly staff and amazing food. I've been going there for a few years and never been dissapointed. Love their homemade soju cocktail, ginger citrus is must try as well as Black god and Bibimbab dishes. Oh and seafood hotpot too. Price is reasonable for the quality of food they deliver. Never tried japanese dishes since I really enjoy korean dishes there but i'm sure they are all great as well."}
{"text":"The service was great. We managed to snag the last table available on a Friday night. Reservations are probably a good idea as the place gets busy. We had the dinner for 2 with pork belly, chicken, and bulgogi. The meats were fantastic. It came with lettuce and rice as well. We didn't have enough lettuce and asked for more, which ended up being $3 extra when we saw the bill. The bibimbaps others had looked good too, would like to try some next time."}
