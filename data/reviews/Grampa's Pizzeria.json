{"text":"I'm typically more of a passerby on sites like this, gleaning information and moving swiftly onward... But here I'm finally pausing to write my first (short and sweet) review because I just love this place so...  Grampa's makes an amazing pizza, but what I'm always blown away by is the specials.  Salads, pastas, special pizzas, soups, all of it.  Any time there's a special I order it, and I've never been disappointed.  There is so much thought put in to each dish and each pizza.  The staff is wonderful and friendly.  The restaurant is clean and cozy (and gorgeous to boot).  Thanks for doing what you do, Gramps, and welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great prices for the quality of food.  The pork confit is a great app.  We ordered the barbini pizza which  is a nice combo of sweet and a spicy kick.  And the most delicious, is the spicy ginger cake.  Service pretty darn good as well.  I am pleased with my friend reco!"}
{"text":"It was probably our fourth time for dinner here last night. Our meals were consistently good. Unfortunately, the male server was a downer and came off snooty. There are lots of options for great dinner experiences in Madison and we will give Grampa's a rest. Get over yourself Gampa's, you're not the Four Seasons."}
{"text":"Great little place, creative pizzas for adults, nice wine and beers. Flavors mesh wonderfully and service is good. We ate at the bar (instead of the cramped table the hostess suggested) and enjoyed our 'za's. Nice dim lighting, too--warm and cozy.  Love this place."}
{"text":"There's nothing old about Grampa's! The food is fresh and always delicious. The staff is on top of their game and the restaurant is beautifully decorated. It makes for the perfect dining experience.  They have a great selection of wine and beer and feature beer from One Barrel (Strong Ale! Strong Ale!)   I would eat here simply to enjoy the sweet little macaroons that they give you at the end of your meal.   Heads up: they are extremely busy on weekends so be prepared. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"So grandpas I wanted to love even before arriving, but the experience was nothing to write home about.  First off let me say the decor and interior are what make this a potential for a better restaurant.  I enjoyed the fact that they went with not being a family oriented restaurant because sometimes you don't want to hear a crying baby while enjoying your meal, this place has a unique concept.  But the food!  How can you make the edges of a pizza crispy and the center absolutely soggy?  And the actual crust was bland at best, it's like the plainest most boring crust in town.  Also it seemed to take a little too long for something so subpar and there were only five other tables, two of which had already been served, actual wait time from ordering to 2 pizzas at table 27:40.  The service also was lacking a bit, it seemed our server wasn't interested in whether we had enough water, or extra napkins.  I actually got my water refilled by the hostess after another table had asked her because they like me were parched.  I won't try again but better luck to those of you who do."}
{"text":"Quant Wonderful! Delicious risotto small plate and amazing thin crust mozeralla bacon Brussel sprout za! Wine list is worth a cheers and a toast!! Matt our server gave fantastic recommendations and the BEST in customer service!! We WILL be back to ENJOY AGAIN SOON!! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Grandpas pizza worst service ever and they refused to serve us at 11:15 pm. You're supposed to be open until midnight.  You suck and we will never be back. We will also be sure that no one else we know will cever come to your establishment.  You suck."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great, original pizzas, absolutely lovely atmosphere. Only downside is that it's small, popular, and doesn't take reservations! I recommend going on a weeknight to avoid crazy waits."}
{"text":"We were really excited when a pizzeria opened in the neighborhood, and Grampa's has yet to disappoint. Excellent food every time and the service is always top notch. We try to order something new each time we go and have only been pleasantly surprised by their flavor infusions. The Barberini & Pinocchio are our favorites. They combine different chili peppers with other flavors for a really unique experience.  Always a lovely experience. The only reason I didn't give five-stars is because the space is very restrictive. Don't expect to spread out much. Still, worth it."}
{"text":"Grampas crushes the P....izza.  The cuisine is superb. The staff is nice looking, knowledgeable, and genuine. Date Night (Tuesday) - Appetizers, Pizza, Bottle of Wine and Dessert = 40.00  The decor is classy, cute and refined.  Hide yo' kids, bring yo wife.  Wanna crush the P?  Take that B to the G."}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner at Grampa's last night. The food was great, but the 3-star review is due to a couple significant missteps on service.   Food:  If you're looking for an appetizer, the Pork Confit is a must-have. They serve it with a great bread and whole grain mustard that goes really well with the pork. All of the pizzas that my group ordered were really good, and the ability to add-on options like giardiniera is awesome.    Service:  We were having a drink at the Crystal Corner (great bar on the same block) and checked in early with the hostess to get our name on the list. She told us to be there at 7:45, but we weren't seated until 8:20. Not the biggest of deals to wait a little bit, but to wait over a half hour was tough. This was compounded by the fact that there's not a great place to wait - you have to essentially stand right by the hostess (which is also where the kitchen is), so you're constantly avoiding people/employees. Especially tough with a big group. One easy solution would've been for the hostess to take our cell phone number, then called us closer to 7:45 when she could tell the table wasn't going to be ready for a bit longer. We'd have been happy to wait a bit more (and have another round at the Crystal Corner).   Also: the service we got after sitting down was not good. There were multiple instances where items were brought out extremely late (one member of my party got her drink after both the appetizers and entrees arrived). The waitress was also not generally helpful or welcoming. It seemed like she was annoyed that we had been seated towards the front and that she had to cover extra ground to cover tables on both sides of the restaurant. I was there to celebrate my bday (we were all happy!), but she was a downer each time she came to the table. Even when she brought my cake, she kind of just dropped it on the table quickly and left (which made the candle go out)."}
{"text":"Grampas is definitely worth a visit. I regularly get their brassacre pizza with brussel sprouts and bacon, which at $15 dinner-for-two is a great value. Sticky ginger cake is tasty as well."}
{"text":"Grampa's was nice. There was a bit of a wait, but the decor - as others have said - was very hip. The service was excellent. The pizza was delicious, but given that they're in the same neighborhood, it's hard not to compare the pizza with Sal's. Now, to be fair to both places, they are very different types of places. Sal's is more casual, has a thicker crust, but also has interesting flavor combinations like Grampa's. In the end, I definitely prefer Sal's, but if you want to go somewhere a little nicer Grampa's is where you should go."}
{"text":"absolutely the best pizza i've had in my face. ever.  i do, however, want to take this opportunity to share with readers that this restaurant is not an extension of your living room; nor is it red robin or tgi friday's. this is a cozy little eatery with little room for double-wide strollers or your ego.  it is a place to enjoy the best pizza you'll ever eat, pure and simple. there are no airs put about, nor are you owed anything; stop being pretentious.  show up hungry and leave more satisfied than you've ever been  and give 'em a break, imagine the trials of running an independent restaurant and show some compassion."}
{"text":"I adore this place. The location is great, the staff are great, the space is great, and the food is wonderful. I love the Brassacre most of all"}
{"text":"Another amazing meal at Grampas. The pork confit is a must order. All the pizzas are astounding. The salads are delightful and vary wonderfully with the seasons! This is my favorite restaurant in Madison hands down."}
{"text":"We just got home from having dinner at Gampa's Pizza and I am not quite sure what to make of that place. I had a garden salad and the Jabroni (tomato/pesto/mozarella/fresh basil) pizza and the rest of our party had the simple pie with the addition of sausage and a Finnochio pizza.  The good things first: The interior of the restaurant is very nice and the place is quiet enough to have a normal conversation without having to yell (you hear that, Graze?). The garden salad was super fresh and had a nice variety of herbs and vegetables and a delicious vinaigrette. The pizza pies had a good size and very nice fresh ingredients. I love thin crust and Grampa's delivered. Now the stuff that makes me give the restaurant only three stars: The pizzas were very salty and the flavor combinations lacked balance for my personal taste. Having grown up across the pond I always wonder why Americans put sausage with fennel (!) on their pizzas. I yet have to see that on a menu in Italy. For me that is just weird but I realize that this is pretty normal here in the US. Likewise, the Jabroni only tasted like basil. While I love fresh basil, a pesto should also have a nutty flavor (pine nuts) and a cheesy flavor from the cheese that you put into pesto. Unfortunately, the pizza had none of the other flavors.  I also question the wisdom of putting brussel sprouts and honey on pizza (I saw that on the menu). I know that these \"innovative,\" locally sourced items are all the rage but for me that made the menu terribly pretentious."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here, but Grampa's doesn't have high chairs or booster seats for children so my family ate elsewhere.  Not a big deal, but disappointed and a bit annoying.  I've heard this restaurant doesn't like families, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. If anyone knows the reason for Grampa's not offering high chairs/booster seats, I'd love to hear it.  (One star only because I have to in order to post.)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.   I wasn't sure what to expect, but I loved the video on their website.   Grampa's is even better in person.   Former gun shop turned pizza place.  The transformation is miraculous.  Charming and cozy space with garden in back.  A true garden to table restaurant with amazing salads and pizza.  Our pizza was topped with fresh watercress.  So fresh and yummy.  If possible, the sticky ginger cake was even better,   And the presentation was fantastic.  Loved it!  Server Brett is goofy, sweet and charming.  Beardy Jake is slyly sweet and has great brows!  Owner/chef Gil knows what he's doing in the kitchen and in the front of the house.   I would visit Madison simply to dine here again."}
{"text":"Date night wonderful. Brussels sprout and bacon pizza exceptional. Pork confit amazing. Desserts awesome. Would eat there everyday if I could.  Only complaint....very noisy."}
{"text":"the pizza is very underwhelming, and is way more a \"flat bread\" than pizza.  the toppings are delicious + hearty, but the thin-ness of the crust makes it very unbalanced. the atmosphere and aura are very good, and the staff was great.  i just don't think i'd ever have the cravings to come back here. glad to get it checked off my list, though."}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience last night!  Went to Grampa's (for the first time!) for the date night special - an appetizer, pizza, dessert, and bottle of wine for $40 per couple.  AMAZING. We had great service - very attentive and nice waitress.  We split a salad for the app and it was fresh and delicious with shaved vegetables and a nice vinaigrette.  The pizza was phenomenal and just the right amount of food.  The wine went down smooth and complimented the food wonderfully.  The dessert was great, and we received complimentary ginger macaroons when we finished!  The ambiance was great and perfect for a date night! We will be back."}
{"text":"Worth the hype. Great cozy atmosphere. Small but well curated wine and beer list. Pizza was very good. We had the Finnochio and Brassacre. Crust light and crisp. I'd rather they cut the pizza normally in slices versus kid squares. The only miss was the risotto starter. Terribly undercooked.  Our gracious server however immediately took it off the bill. Come early or prepare to wait. We got the last open table when we arrived at 5:40 on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Pizza:  The crust is very thin and the sauce has a delicious tang to it.  We ordered two pizzas - one cheese and one Barberini.  The cheese was fine - I mean it is a cheese pizza.  The Barberini blew my mind.  It is a whole mess of nontraditional ingredients that work together perfectly.  Dessert:  There are two: a flight of ice cream sandwiches and a ginger cake.  The ice cream sandwiches won't blow your mind, but they are delicious and fun.  I mean, they are a FLIGHT of ice cream sandwiches.  How could that not be awesome.  The ginger cake is one warm mountain of buttery goodness.  Consider sharing it because it is big and rich.  Atmosphere: Wonderful.  It is a little loud, so it may not be a good place for an anniversary.  It would also be hard for a group because the tables are small.  Service:  Friendly and professional.  Reservations: No and it is a bit of a problem.  The wait can easily be an hour and a half on the weekend.  Tip: call ahead and get on the wait list when you get in the car.  Parking:  Tough.  There is only street parking and Willy Street can be a mess.    Credit Cards: Yes"}
{"text":"My husband and I went and it being our first time we read the reviews on the place like we do with any new place we go, and we really enjoyed the whole experience. The space was well used, our server was very helpful, I will agree with the previous customers that the pork confit was amazing, and we had the most amazing desert (the ginger cake) was outstanding, not overly sweet and did not skimp on the whip cream for the top, you got a taste with each bite. So the person who said not to order it had no concept of what they are talking about, definitely try it. We also got homemade macaroons with a blueberry preserve as we left that were absolutely phenomenal.   Our complements to the chef and his staff for such a comfortable and unforgettable experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was at Grampa's last nite for the 4 Pinots and a Chard wine dinner. The wines and the food pairings were fantastic. I particularly liked the squash & burrata pizza. The crust was SO good and the squash along with squash blossoms and nasturtiums from the Grampa's garden sent this course over the top. The waygu beef with oyster mushrooms & cherry tapenade was also outstanding. They have a great space here with food to match. We'll be back to try the regular menu in the very near future!"}
{"text":"Reeeeally good gluten free pizza. Knowledgeable staff. The wait times are unfortunate but worth it--  The pork confit is outstanding and I dream about the Goomba pizza."}
{"text":"My hubby and I ate here for the first time last night - celebrating our wedding anniversary - and we were thoroughly impressed. I had been told by other friends to expect a long wait, or that the service was lacking, so I wasn't necessarily expecting to be wowed, but everything far exceeded our expectations. This was a memorable meal at a great new business, and we will definitely be coming back soon.   The ambiance of the place is really lovely - candles and natural wood and nice light from the windows. It reminded me of the interior of the former Underground Kitchen, which I loved. They've done a great job restoring and transforming the old gun shop/attached house, and the restaurant has an intimate and classy feel that I think is equally suitable for a casual romantic evening or a lively dinner out with friends.  We were promptly greeted by a cheerful host, who invited us to sit at the bar while we waited (not long) for a table. Contrary to other reviews, I found the staff to be highly attentive and friendly throughout, from the bartender to our main server. As a former waiter at a high-end restaurant, I have pretty high standards for service, and I was very pleased with how well we were tended to during our leisurely meal. (More water? Fresh napkins? Clean plates? All was taken care of before we had to request it.)  Most importantly, the food at Grampa's was excellent. We ordered several things to share: the homemade mozzarella; the seasonal vegetable (in this case, blistered peppers sprinkled with bonito and dashi); panzanella salad; pepperoni pizza; and sticky ginger cake for dessert. Everything was wonderfully fresh and flavorful, with original touches that make the offerings unlike any other pizzeria (or restaurant) in town. I appreciated the chef's surprising touches, from the creamsicle-evoking creaminess of vanilla fleur du sel sprinkled on the fresh mozzarella, to a slight echo of honey mingling with the richness of pepperoni and leeks on our pizza. The ginger cake we shared for dessert was an incredible warm delight-- a cross between moist gingerbread and a perfectly-crispy cake donut, topped with not-too-sweet whipped cream and a handful of crushed pistachios. For all this goodness, plus two drinks apiece, we paid just $66 with tax and tip. A similar meal in Chicago, San Francisco, or New York would have easily cost twice that much. ($4 for a beautifully-prepared \"seasonal vegetable\" appetizer? $13 for a pizza big enough to share? This is seriously good value.)  We are greatful to have this special spot in our neighborhood and look forward to its success. Well done, Grampa's!"}
{"text":"The owners have done a truly amazing job of transforming the place into a beautiful, comfortable space, with reclaimed wood, dark colors, vintage metal accents and a great view of the big tree out back. The crowd was a great mix of neighborhood folks, couples, families with kids, babies, grandparents. Our party of four tried 3 vegetarian pizzas, the Jabroni, the Barberini, and the basic with mushrooms. The pesto on the Jabroni was fresh and bright. The Baberini was unlike any pizza I've ever had, firey and sweet, though the garlic was a little overwhelming - might be better if it roasted? The Basic was a favorite - perfect cheese-to-sauce ratio! Service was excellent. I am looking forward to sitting at the bar and trying some small plates and more of the wine list!"}
{"text":"I went to Grampas last night for the first time and I will definitely be back! We ordered the beet salad, and the goat cheese that comes on it should be a dish of its own. I seriously wanted to just eat a bowl of that with a spoon! The pizza was super inventive and tasty. Apparently they have a large garden in the back where they harvest many of their ingredients, but since it was winter we didn't get to see it. I do love a thin crust pizza, and this place makes them very thin, which suited me perfectly! Our server was very attentive without being intrusive, and at the end of the meal she brought us each a macaroon!  I can't wait to come back with my husband. They have date nights on Tuesdays where you can get a salad/small plate, specialty pizza, dessert, and a bottle of wine for only $40!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in Madison.  Yes you will wait if you go on date night or Friday at 7, but it is (sometimes) worth it.  If they tell you it's going to be an hour and a half, it might be longer.  But the pizza, the pork confit, and everything else I've had on the menu (beet salad especially) is so good and made with care.  I love the crust and the quality of all the ingredients used here.  I disagree with the Elite reviewer that this place has an air of pretentiousness - I never felt that here.  Servers have always been wonderful too.  Very cozy and romantic atmosphere - and I think prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Grampa's is a must visit for me when I have my pizza obsessed friend in from CA.  We went on a Friday night around 9:30 and were seated immediately. We started with a bottle of Malbec and shared 2 of their salads between the three of use.  We chose the Carrot salad and the Panzanella.  We LOVED both, but the Carrot salad was the hands down winner. it was perfectly dressed with amazing flavor and just a hint of spice from the cashews. We always order the Jabroni (which we did) and of course it  was amazing as usual. We also ordered the Pinnichio for the first time.  I am very picky when it comes to sausage on pizza.  This sausage was amazing!  The spice from the Anaheim chilies was perfect.   This may have taken over as my favorite pizza there.  As always the Sticky Ginger cake finished off our meal, one regular and one without pistachios as I am allergic to them. Always amazing. My boyfriend (who is normally only about chocolate desserts) could not get enough of this on a separate visit. I am introducing my Mom to this favorite restaurant of mine later this month and am certain she will love it as much as my friends and I do. As far as the service goes, they have ALWAYS been kind, courteous, efficient and knowledgeable. This is, hand down, my favorite place to eat in Madison.  The atmosphere is relaxing and quaint."}
{"text":"I have never felt happier thinking about pizza than when I'm thinking of Grampa's Pizza. It's the most delicious, crispy, thin crust pizza with the most delicious and inventive toppings. Each pizza I have enjoyed here has been a true work of art, from the way it's presented to the way it so beautifully tastes. The ambience is second to none. I've never experienced a \"fine dining\" pizzeria and this place is really a class act. Perfectly romantic yet perfectly casual at the same time, it's really just perfect for any occasion.  As for the gluten-free crust, I have shared many of them with a gluten-intolerant friend of mine and honestly couldn't tell the difference between that and a regular crust. Phenomenal. Their small plates are also not to be forgotten - some of the most amazing appetizers I've ever had. They are light and creative and deep in flavor, and always very pretty to look at before devouring. They have a wonderful wine selection too that pairs so perfectly with any of their pizzas. Grampa's quickly become one of my top 5 places to have dinner in Madison. Grampa's, please never ever go away. :)"}
{"text":"Have not managed to find a place that has such good pizza compared to South Africa. I love the toppings that they use. Very creative pizzas. Nice thin crust too. Delicious. And they have great ginger beer on tap!"}
{"text":"This is a must! If you have nowearied it yet, definitely take the time. The space is charming and warm and has a urban touch. The menu is well rounded and would have something for everyone. This is not a typical pizzeria it is for people who have the appreciation for fine food and ingredients that make dinning a tasty experience. The staff is very attentive and make you feel at home. The Beet salad is out of this world!! But everything we had was so good. We look forward to going back and bringing friends to share this golden nugget on Willy street!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Willy street restaurant. Tough to find a table between 5 and 8, but the pizzas are well worth it (and the wait staff is fantastic). Try the beet salad and trust in their specials - I haven't gone wrong with a single one of them. If you're looking for spectacular thin-crust pizza that isn't just a pile of cheese, this is your spot."}
{"text":"I absolutely Love Grandpas Pizza!!! It's a great local pizzeria here in the Madison area! Let's start of with a great atmosphere!The place is small but cozy!! The service is really good they are very attentive to the food and you! The food is so good i like thin crust pizza and for me the pizza is crispy but no Burt with great FRESH toppings this is just how a thin crust pizza should be!! I love how everything is so fresh and they have a garden in the back of the restaurant were they grow all vegetables and fruits!!! I really recommend for you to go to Grandpas pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Grampa's for a while, and I'm glad I chose a Sunday night for it. We had no wait for 2, but be prepared if you come on a Friday or Saturday night as the place is cozy. The atmosphere is spectacular - small, quiet, great for conversation because you can actually hear your table mates.   We ordered 2 pizzas to share - the Finocchio and Cerv's Up. Unfortunately they were out of anchovies but added bacon on the Cerv's Up. Cerv's Up was our favorite - you can't beat San Marzano tomatoes, and the bacon was a nice add as you get large chunks of smoky, meaty goodness.   The thin crust on the pizzas is so good - light and crunchy, and really showcases the fresh ingredients. Next time I want to try the Brassacre.  For dessert we split the sticky ginger cake, which had the perfect amount of ginger spice, a great crust, and like 2 inches of freshly whipped cream on top. So delicious and warm.   Scott was our server and he was awesome!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  I wasn't in love with the 1.5hr wait, but luckily Mickey's (a few blocks away) has a fantastic beer selection and Grampa's will call when your table is ready.    The pork confit and beet salad were a delightful start to our meal.  We had a tough time choosing pies, since they all sounded wonderful.  Ended up with the Brassacre (brussels, bacon, etc.) and the Goomba (garlic cream, mushrooms, etc.).  Obviously too much food for two people, but it made for tasty leftovers that my husband and I fought over.  Reasonably priced, lovely atmosphere, eclectic tap list, yes yes yes!  Can't wait to return with whoever visits us next."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service.  Pork confit and Finnocchio pizza were scrumptious, but the ginger cake threw it over the top. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and very tasty thin crust pizza, served with quality toppings...they also have some nice sides/starters (fresh mozzarella, oh yeah...) and the ginger cake rocks. Because the food is so delish, the small space is often packed, but it's well worth the wait if you are craving non-chain pizza...."}
{"text":"Have only been here once, but I really enjoyed it. The pizza combinations were inventive and eating at the bar is my favorite way to eat pizza. Beer and wine only, which was a bummer for us vodka lovers. Service was friendly and quick, the place was really hopping so you should expect to have to wait a while for a table."}
{"text":"We liked it so much we ordered carry out twice over our two day stay.  The pizza was very fresh and good."}
{"text":"The pros: The ambiance. The wine list. The appetizers. The vegetarian pizza offerings. The cool private room in front for larger groups. And did I mention the ambiance???  The so-so's: The pizza sauce. It's a preference thing, but their standard red sauce is a little off-putting in its spiciness.  The cons: It's a small place. That's not bad, but they don't accept reservations or have a bar where you can get a drink while you wait for a table. And the last two times we've been there, the hostess was pretty rude.   All in all, it's a place I'd be happy to go to at someone else's suggestion, but I probably won't be seeking it out that often on my own."}
{"text":"Never got to the pizza. Most bizarre of business practices... Call to order a pizza for carryout. I never had a chance to ask the size of the pizza. Never had an opportunity to place my order. I asked to place a take out order. After a brief hold, I'm told no take out til 9 PM, but they could seat me right away? Without thinking, I said we'd try another time & the call ends. Then I had a mental double-take: I can come in, get seated, & have a pizza placed in front of me, but they can't put that pizza in a box for take out?! I called back, questioning if I understood correctly, & apparently I had. So I'm offered you know, \"confusion,\" \"our first week,\" \"we can actually do it...\" because, I'm told, \"we're empty right now.\" What? Have I lost my friggin mind?! I'm told the first few nights were slammed (understandably), & the kitchen's still trying to figure out what they can handle, so on, so forth. Excuses, for sure. I mean, I understand the call taker was trying to make things right, but refusing business when you're empty? That's not even a \"first week\" error, it's just absolutely contrary to the point of business. Isn't part of a pizzeria's business take out? Admit the error, apologize, & spare me the excuses. Excuses killed my appetite to be honest, because excuses leave a bad taste. Having worked in the service industry for over 10 years, the businesses' problems, like overwhelming your kitchen's capacity/over-seating the room, are of no concern to the customer. A customer wants good food, but more importantly good service. I had neither.   You know, few years ago, I purchased an AK-47 from Grampa, in the same spot, Grampa's Pizzeria now occupies. I couldn't help but chuckle, when it occurred to me, it was easier to buy an assault rifle from Grampa's Gun Shop than it is to get a pizza for carryout from Grampa's Pizzeria. So, so weird. Anyhow, I'll probably give another chance at some point, but I couldn't let this one slide."}
{"text":"Wife and I just had their \"date night\" - awesome mozzarella appetizer, then the Pork confit pizza and finally the ginger cake. All three sublime - and the vibe and lighting of the place is awesome. Be aware that place is very small, so be prepared for a wait on weekends. But worth it!!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the cutesy name. A dinner at Grandpa's Pizzeria is a classy affair. Atmospheric lighting, trendy interior design, and of course amazing pizzas is what makes this restaurant one of Madison's most popular date night locations. The only issue you'll have with this pizza joint is actually snagging a table."}
{"text":"Holy. Smokes.   This place has some REALLY great food. We had a smoked salmon pizza, the mozzarella/tomato/basil appetizer and some olives. And of course, wine. Everything was amazin'.  Atmosphere was great. Our service was awesome!  I'd definitely go back. Repeatedly."}
{"text":"The ambiance is calm and relaxing. The wait can be a bit long and the bar only has a few spots to belly up to but the addition of Gib's Bar just Nextdoor makes the wait go quickly.  The cheeseboard is ever changing and the wine selection is simple but gives enough great options.  Pizza is a crispy thin crust and not a single pizza is disappointing.   Go on a Tuesday night with someone you want to impress because their date night special is perfect.  The garden is pretty to look at but some outdoor seating is severely lacking. Add that and it's a 5 every time."}
{"text":"Some of the best service I've ever received in Madison.  Attentive yet not intrusive waiter with great suggestions for pairings, who didn't mind checking on our questions about the menu with the kitchen a couple of times.   I was shocked at how beautiful the place was.  Having only seen Grampa's as a gun shop, from a tiny streetside window, to walk into a warmly ambient cozy yet bright place was surprising, and we were delighted to sit next to the back window, with a view of their garden and vast green backyard.   And the food. Might be the most perfect salad I've ever had in Madison- the market salad- chockful of literally every vegetable in season. Perfect tomatoes, snap peas, yellow squash, broccoli, green beans, radishes, and beautifully ribboned baby carrots.  All brought together with slivers of blood oranges and plums, and plump green olives.  SO good.  We also had the fresh mozzarella (made inhouse daily) which was lovely, and the pork confit/gorgonzola pizza (from which I mostly abstained- tablemate loved it).    Prices were totally reasonable (our total bill for a glass of wine, two salads and a pizza was $38), and I love that they're open past bartime! Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were great. Very rude service unfortunately and was not treated very nice. Did not feel welcome"}
{"text":"5/5+ Paired with next door neighbor and sister Gib's, this is probably the \"coolest\" spot in Madison for drinks and dinner.   The decor/design is perfectly \"rustic contemporary chic\" and the lighting is sublime.  The pizza and appetizers are a knock out (you will need fewer of the pizzas to share than the waiter might suggest though) and the house-suggested wines are perfect. If you have a big enough group, sit in the front room- it's so god-damn adorable for a #fam meal (or a family meal)."}
{"text":"To start, when we arrived they told us it would be about a 45 minute to an hour wait but we could leave our name and phone number and they would calls when our table was ready. But after waiting for an hour and fifteen minutes we had not received a call and decided to check on our reservation, only to find that our name had been crossed off. The hostess offered no apology but did give us the next table that opened up.  As for the food, it is very overpriced and the portions are tiny. We started off splitting a beet salad between the two of us and for $8.50 it wasn't a big enough salad for one person. Then we split a basic pie with basil, roasted red pepper and artichokes, the pizza wasn't bad but also nothing special. Our main complaint was that we expected more than a 10\" personal pizza for $15. Needless to say we were both still hungry after. I'd only recommend grampa's pizza if you like spending way too much for ver"}
{"text":"I went here recently on a date night, and we could not have picked a better place. Madison was definitely in need of a great pizza restaurant, and I think this place is it! It looked like they grew some of their own vegetables in a garden out back which is awesome! We added sausage to one of our pizzas, and it was probably the best sausage I've ever had. The wait staff was very friendly, and I loved the flavored water (with grapefruit and raspberries). Great place for a date or dinner with friends/family."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is amazing!! We were able to get a table right away and water right away. And this isn't ANY kind of water! It had a citrusy flavour to it and was very refreshing. We ordered 3 pizzas for a family of 6 and it was more than enough for us! The beet salad was AMAZING! They have 2 unisex bathrooms that were pretty clean and well taken care of. The restaurant was pretty small and narrow but it's on Willy Street, I don't expect huge buildings on this street. The pizzas were cooked to perfection and the ginger ale was amazing. We had a lot of fun there and will definitely come back (maybe just for the beet salad!) I wish they serve food all day but they start serving food at 1700. Which is why this place would be really great for dinner! I would call in advance if you have a huge group. This place is definitely a gem!!! Delicious food and great company makes for the perfect ending to a great day!"}
{"text":"Hats off to Grampa and his outstanding pizzeria. One of my favorite restaurants to go that is located on Willy street. I've visited here about five times in the past year and half and always leave satisfied.  My most recent visit was on Valentine's day. There was a prix fixe that patrons had the option of choosing. This menu featured some unique dishes that allowed Chef Gil Altschul to flex his culinary muscles and show customers what else his talents include.  The Valentine's menu consisted of a bottle of wine, charcuterie board, butter poached lobster served on vanilla bean rissoto, a specialty pizza (the ones that are usually on the menu), and either ginger cake or chocolate mousse for desert. My girlfriend's tree nut allergy leaves us to always request no nuts on any dishes. Of course Grampa's pizza obliged to our request, but, they did something that really no other restaurant has done for us: they replaced some of the tree nut containing items with subsititues to ensure we still enjoyed full servings of food. This really was an unexpected, considerate, and generous gesture.  The charcuterie board was well planned with a great mix of crunchy and soft textures, acidic and flat tastes, and rich and lean flavors. The rissoto was perfectly paired: the lobster offered a richness to a rissoto that was unqiuely flavored. I'd say that this is some of the best lobster I've ever had in Madison. Obviously the pizza is great, with a thin, crispy crust, many fresh flavors and bold meats. The dessert while not my personal favorite was really good as well.  The service has always been top notch.   Give Gramps a shot and prepare your socks to be blown off, figuratively, of course :).  PS - They are environmentally considerate as well being a clean energy partner. If you peek in the backyard, you will see a garden where the fruits of talented green thumbs are apparent (maybe not much during the winter)."}
{"text":"You guys. Grampa's. Is. Amazing.   My parents and I stopped in after a wedding this past weekend, and we were blown away. The ambiance is incredible (cozy without being stuffy) and every piece of decor is impeccable. Our server was excellent-- very attentive, personable, and accommodating. We were originally seated next to the LOUDEST table of adults I had ever heard (they were literally yelling on top of each other) and after we made several futile attempts to get them to take it down a notch (at one point my mom looked at them, threw her hands in the air, and yelled \"REALLY?\" They didn't even notice.), our lovely server reseated us at a beautiful table at the front of the house.   The food was absolutely perfect. We started with the olive plate ($4 for a VERY generous plate of assorted olives), and it was the perfect little appetizer. Then the chef brought out an heirloom tomato salad with fresh pesto drizzle and some sort of microgreens on top, and it was divine. We ordered two pizzas, one was the special of the day with chanterelle mushrooms and garlic sauce (which we ordered on a gluten-free crust), and one had pesto and tomato sauce with smoked mozzarella. They were both delicious, but I have to go on a little gluten-free tangent here:   I have not had pizza like this since I stopped eating wheat. The crust is made in-house (not the soggy sawdust kind that is bought in at restaurants all over Milwaukee), and MAN, what a difference. It was crispy all the way through and stayed that way, even when I was eating my cold leftovers for breakfast the next morning. Even my wheat-eating parents enjoyed the gluten-free crust, and they consider themselves true pizza aficionados. I left Grampa's deliriously happy because for the first time in years I was able to eat amazing pizza without any ...ahem... repercussions. Hallelujah!   Overall we had an outstanding experience, and I will be making the drive from Milwaukee again soon."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. I would call it an upscale pizzeria. We had the mozzarella to start, followed with a salad and ended with their bacon and Brussels Sprouts pizza. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Willy street restaurant. Tough to find a table between 5 and 8, but the pizzas are well worth it (and the wait staff is fantastic). Try the beet salad and trust in their specials - I haven't gone wrong with a single one of them. If you're looking for spectacular thin-crust pizza that isn't just a pile of cheese, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Thin for the win. I love Grampa's thin crust za's more than any other pie place in town. This place is quant, and gets pretty crowded on a weekend; I would recommend popping over to Gibs next door for a drink while you wait.   And trust me, the wait is worth it. My friends and I all opted for veg-friendly options, but for the meat-eaters out there, there are plenty of pork topping options to go around. We started with the olives and eggplant tapenade (two separate apps); the server happily brought out more crostini to finish off our eggplant spread. YUM to the apps. Light, not overbearing. Just what you need to complement the main.   We shared two pizzas between four of us, which seemed to be the perfect portion. The Jabroni - Pedro/tomato sauce, fresh basil, mozzarella, and chiles...it had a kick! The Goomba was our second za with garlic cream sauce and mushrooms atop. Ask for extra cream sauce, it's oh so worth it. I can't even choose a favorite, because I spent too much time being impressed with the thin crust.   I will say that the small menu does favor the meat eaters of this world, but I'm still nonetheless fond of and attached to their crispy, crusty, creative pies."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here and I can't rave enough. They have an amazing Tuesday date night deal that I highly recommend. Even without the deal though, their prices are quite reasonable.   My date and I had the pork belly risotto for a small plate, and it was delightful! The pork belly was incredibly tender and the risotto was very flavorful. We had the goomba pizza which was also delicious. It was nice thin crust with ample toppings.   The service and ambiance of the restaurant was also very impressive. They had an amazing playlist the night I was there, my date and I were serenading each other between bites! Our server was very attentive to our needs and was very helpful in explaining some of the menu items. This is definitely one of my favorite sit-down restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"Unique food - worth a visit.  We were swinging through town and decided to have some pizza. Fellow yelpers identified grandpas as a good place, so we went there!  When we arrived at grandpas there was a 45 minute wait on a Saturday evening, so the hostess gave us another option: go next-door to Gibbs to have a drink and order grandpa pizza from there.   It was a good decision! The furniture and atmosphere was very laid back, the cocktail selection was great.  The pizza arrived promptly and both the pepperoni and \"brassercre\" were excellent (very crispy thin crust).  Each piece of the brassacre had a small amount of brussel sprout on it, with generous pieces of bacon and a delicious cheese.   The menu items were unique and tasty."}
{"text":"I am a huge pizza fan. Easily one of my favorite foods (to the detriment of my waistline). But I'm usually just your standard cheese pizza type of girl, so imagine my surprise when I found that I absolutely love all the different, crafty combos at Grampa's. The Goomba is absolutely amazing; the cheese, garlic cream sauce and fresh herbs are heaven in my mouth (it comes with mushrooms too, if you're into that, but I always leave them off). The Brassacre is also great; these two would definitely be the ones to try on your first visit.   The ambiance is also fantastic; a very urban feel to it, perfect for date nights or dinner with friends.   Try it out; you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Second time here and this place is awesome!! Arrived at 5:00 on a Saturday, had no problem getting a table we had two small plates Olive's and mozzarella. For pizza we ate two , the Goomba and a pepperoni with a thin and crispy crust, the leeks on the pepperoni put it over the top.Dessert was Chocolate mousse with grapefruit and almonds,what a party in your mouth, and then the always excellent Sticky ginger cake!! Staff was relaxed and pleasant Place gets 7 Stars from me, 10 if they could still clean my guns."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the aesthetic of this place: surprisingly large windows overlooking a tree-filled back yard, hardwood floors, white-tiled wall behind the bar, menus that look as though they were typed on a typewriter. I dig.   The service was also excellent: friendly, prompt, polite. The servers are a cool and attractive bunch as well.   The pizza? OK, unfortunately, here's where I was a bit disappointed. Now, it's not bad. The ingredients ensure that the pizza will not be terrible (smoked mozzarella, pesto, pork confit...), but something about the crust was just not quite right. When having thin-crust pizza, texture is way important...and the crust was a little more cracker-like than I was expecting. So wah.   But give it a try. It's a cool date spot regardless."}
{"text":"I was really eager to try Grampa's Pizza as I've heard many great things about it. Grampa's is a cozy little spot with fantastic pizza. I loved the atmosphere. Unfortunately the wait was too long that we decided to sit at the bar. The bar was beautiful, a copper finish with a few cute quirky mirrors. The bartender was really nice and knowledgeable about the drinks and the food. My boyfriend and I split the Finocchio Pizza, which was so delicious. We both like that the pizza is thin crust. I don't discriminated against thicker or stuffed crust, but thin crust has that crispy crunch and provides the perfect vessel for the fixings. Finocchio pizza had a cheese blend, fennel, sausage and Anaheim chile which provided that perfect kick if you're into spicy. It was a perfect amount of hot that enhanced the flavor without taking away from the fennel or sausage. I would definitely eat here again as I had my eye on a few other Za's too."}
{"text":"When coming here it's just like going to your actual Grampa's - meaning, timing is everything!  It doesn't matter if it's a Sunday or a Wednesday, this place is hopping.  For our first visit, we went on a Saturday at 6pm and had to wait about half an hour for a table. Fortunately there was space at the bar so we were able to snag some drinks while we waited.  On my second visit, it was 5pm (opening time) on a Sunday. We were able to get seated immediately (yippee!) but the place was definitely filling up by the time we left at 6:30pm.  The ambiance is nice; warm and cozy, with a small front room with two tables and the rest of the seating in the back of the house/restaurant. We sat in the main part of the restaurant (overlooking the backyard) both times I was here and at risk of sounding like my Mom... it was loud!  I think the low ceilings combined with the hardwood floors just really made sound bounce around. The Mister and I were both struggling to hear eachother, even at our small table.    During both visits, the food was great. They also have a nice beer list but it makes me nuts that only the beer names are listed and not the type (i.e., IPA, stout, etc.). I know what type of beer I like but don't always recognize craft names so this presented a challenge. Fortunately, one I could overcome.    The Mister and I ordered a pizza each, which was plenty as we both had leftovers. We probably could have gotten away with one pizza if we'd ordered a salad and appetizer.  I had the basic pie ($9 + toppings cost $1-$3/ea) with mushrooms and was pleased with the thin crust and generous portion of toppings. On a subsequent visit I went with three other friends and we  ordered two of the specialty pizzas and an appetizer - this was the perfect amount of food for the four of us. We had the two vegetarian pizzas: The Barberini ($14 - ricotta, garlic, calabrian chilies, tomato sauce, watercress, honey) and The Goomba ($13- garlic cream sauce, house blend cheese, mushrooms, fresh herbs).  I never would have ordered either of them on my own (\"watercress and honey on a pizza?!\" and \"ugh, garlic cream sauce sounds too rich\") BUT I was proved wrong b/c both were excellent.  Who knew!    Well. I guess Grampa did."}
{"text":"LOVE GRAMPA'S!  Came here last Sunday night for dinner, after getting whiffs of their delicious pizza from Gibs next door. What a great meal we had!   Drinks - Their menu is impressive. Wine and beer alike! I enjoyed a great stout :).   Apps - If you love olives, get them here! Also, the dumplings were amazing. Highly recommend those!   Pizza - We shared the Jabroni. We wanted something nice and light. It was great, the crust was perfect.  We wished we would have added the sausage after the waiter recommended doing this. Still was fabulous!! Next time, i will be more adventurous.   All this together, cost under $60. I thought this was a steal. We will be back soon, period."}
{"text":"Tuesday night, 6 pm, no wait at Grandpa's for the three of us.  We sat in the cozy back room and ordered a Sweetie Pie (hold the chorizo) and the pepperoni, along with a market salad.    The salad came first and was delicious, dressed perfectly with a light tangy vinagrette.  It had beet shavings, carrot shavings, a few green and yellow beans, and several kinds of greens, including, perhaps, some watercress.  It was a bit dark back there, so hard to tell.  I  only wish it had been more generous.  Quality is more important than quantity, but another handful of greens -- and a larger plate -- would have made this a 5.  The pizza was crispy-crusted and the thinnest I've seen anywhere.  Kudos -- it wasn't over-sauced and didn't get soggy.  I  liked the way it was cut into small pieces.  Both pizzas had excellent blending of flavors, with enough pepperoni to have some in each square.  And because we held the chorizo, our server comped us for it on the bill.  Nice.  Our only drink was one cider.  It was still on the expensive side for the amount of food , about $50 with tip and tax-- we all had room for chocolate shoppe ice cream afterwards -- so I would say a good 4.5 stars.  A worthwhile pizza splurge!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed!  It took me a while to get to this restaurant since I came to Madison because the wait was too long and I wasn't in a situation to wait for a while. On a Tuesday, I came at 6pm for 2 people. We were seated right away and people started filling up the restaurant in ~30 minutes. The place is so cute and their dishes are fantastic!! We ordered the radish salad, pork confit small plate, and the pizza du jour. The radish salad was beautiful and delicious. Radishes were slightly warm, slightly soft, and slightly crunchy. It was decorated with some edible flowers and is served on a wooden board. So gorgeous. The pork confit was also excellent and beautifully presented. Pork was very soft; the dish came with a delicious ground mustard and pickled veggies/peppers. Sourdough it all came with was great too! I would probably have liked it a bit less toasted, but it was still good and that's probably just personal preference. The pizza was great! I honestly dont remember all of the toppings on it, except that it had shishito peppers on it (so we decided not to order that small plate). I was never the biggest fan of pizza, in that I would enjoy it if I had it but wasnt my first choice of food. I lived in New Haven, CT for a couple years where I fell in love with their thin crust pizza at a place called BAR and would crave this all the time. The pizza at Grampa's reminded me of that famous New Haven pizza, but the other plates, ambiance, and everything else is so much more elegant at Grampa's. Then, to finish, we ordered the sticky lemon ginger cake, which was again just beautiful and delicious. The cake wasn't as \"sticky\" as expected from the name, but it was just delicious. The texture inside was the perfect balance of moist, dense, and fluffly and the crispy outside is my favorite! Flavors of the cake were really well-balanced as well. The ginger and lemon flavors are really there. The whipped cream on top was so light and refreshing (home-whipped?) and the crushed pistachios on top just felt so appropriate."}
{"text":"Grampa's? More like Grumpy's. I won't be returning after the owner Gilbert Altschul sent me this email: \"I'm sure there are plenty of empty pizzerias that you and your friends can camp out in and talk about nonsense.\"  I had sent him an email expressing my disappointment in how rudely we were treated at the end of our meal. We enjoyed an app, two pizzas, a dessert and a bottle of wine but apparently spreading out that meal over 2 hours was unacceptable and we were rudely told to leave by a manager when she said, \"We have a long wait and I need you to leave now.\" We had signed the check only 10 minutes prior. Also, we are three very nice ladies in our 30s, not like a group of rowdy, rude, annoying people.  I know the place is small but a simple, \"Due to our small space, we'd appreciate if our patrons restricted their meal to 90 minutes or less,\" on the menu would have been helpful or a \"I'm so sorry to ask this but we're on a long wait. Do you mind wrapping up your conversation?\" would have been perfectly acceptable.   After hearing about their breastfeeding debacle and all the boycotters within their first couple weeks of business it's surprising that an owner who treats his customers so poorly can remain in business. Madison is a wonderful food city, there's no need to support a man who treats his paying customers in this way. Ever heard of \"the customer is always right?\" I was even up front with the fact that I'm a food and travel writer (trying to let him redeem himself) but he still sent that ridiculous response to me."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza! I have had all of them thus far and not a single one wasn't superb! I can't wait to work through the small plates and salad menu. Also the ice cream sandwich was to die for. Beautiful restaurant, wonderful service, very very happy to welcome it to my neighborhood! Oh and for everyone having issues with bringing their children, I sat next to a table with 2 kids under the age of 4 and they seemed to be having a great time, without high chairs."}
{"text":"I moved to the US 5 years ago from Italy. I was before in NY and moved to Chicago almost 2 years ago. My girlfriend booked a place in Madison, Wisconsin for the weekend. Behind suggestion of a acquaintance we came here for dinner. This was the best dinner I've ever had since i moved to the US. Finally a place where you pay (below average) for great food (way above expectations)!  On top of that, like it happens in Italy, the restaurant does not \"exploit\" the customer but they make you feel appreciated and they give you a treat (in our case we were given cookies for breakfast). I wish most of the restaurants in the US would be like this one.  I can't thank you enough for the great experience, from the small plates, to the appetizers,the pizza and the dessert.  I'll come back again from Chicago to eat at this gem!  Thank you"}
{"text":"I like to wait a month or two after a place opens to try it out.  I wasn't disappointed on a recent Saturday night. The place was busy later in the evening but we were seated after only a few minutes with no reservations made. The ambience is great: cozy, romantic, and warm.  This is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  The Pinoccio pizza was fantastic. I'm not a great fan of thin crust pizza, but this is as good as it gets.  The sauce was a bit sweet, but that seems to be what people want.  My wife and I split the house salad and man, that was amazing. I can't remember all the ingredients, but there were about a dozen goodies in there.  The waitstaff were prompt and courteous too.  I'm giving you 5 stars, Grandpa."}
{"text":"Good decent pizza, walking distance for Willy street folks. Only drawback - so popular you have an hour wait even on weekdays. They don't take reservations, however, you could call and leave your name on the wait list and they'll call you back when a table is ready. Also, another tip for couples or singles, sit at the bar! Friendly experience and usually less wait than the tables.  Tuesdays happen to be date night - $40 for appetizer, pizza, dessert and a bottle of wine! Such a great deal. Also, my favorite server, Steph, is at the bar on Tuesdays and Thursdays!  One thing to note, there are no cocktails. There is a full wine and beer list though. I was really happy they have the spanish Cava (sparkling wine like champagne).   What's great to try: Risotto - flavors change, nice and creamy Puerco - Pork confit Pizza, I love pork confit! Brassacre - thick bacon, brussel sprouts Barberini - honey, water cress, spicy chiles; very unique. sweet and spicy pizza Calamari - nduja sausage stuffed calamari, tomato sauce, vanilla and delicious fingerling potatoes; very very unique dish! good to try if you like spicy!  I'll definitely be back, but I'll call ahead to leave my name on the waiting list, instead of heading straight to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Grampa's yet, it's time to put it on your list. They don't take reservations, but that's actually a good thing: You can go next door to Gibs, a house converted into an awesomely decorated bar, and Grampa's will call you when your table is ready. If you're looking for a great drink at Gibs try the terrific Yirgacheffe cocktail, though I never had anything there that wasn't both creative and tasty. Back to Grampa's: This is a pizza place with appetizers, and don't skip them either! The pork confit is out of this world; tender, juicy, and delicious! If there's a risotto on the list order that too (the appetizer line up changes often). The salads are super fresh, and I've seen the owner at the Farmer's Market--so I know where many of the ingredients come from. You can't go wrong with any of the pizzas, but the Puerco, the Finnochio, and the Brassacre are some of my favorites. The crust is thin and crispy, and the pizzas are incredible. The service is at least as good as the food; attentive and friendly. I live across town from Grampa's but it's well worth the drive ten times over!"}
{"text":"So, so so cute!!!    My sister and I randomly picked this spot for dinner when I was visiting Madison.  We initially tried the bar next door for a cocktail and as this was close, we stopped in and lucked out with immediate seating.  We were seated next to the windows in the back - so cute to look outside (though, blinds would be excellent for when the sun sets).    Our server was really nice - he gave recommendations and didn't rush us though it was getting busy (and he seemed to be running around).    We shared appetizers (cheese of course!) and pizzas.  Everything was fresh and delicious (and who doesn't love fresh mozzarella?!).  I could have eaten 10 more pizzas.  Thin crust, really fresh ingredients (tomato, cheese, etc).    This was the cutest spot - the food was delicious, excellent wine selection and also a friendly server in a really cozy spot.    I can't wait to return.  Food - 5 Atmosphere - 5 Service - 5 Value - 5"}
{"text":"Tuesday night is Date Night at Granpa's. I went with 3 wonderful women and had a great time. So we paired up to accommodate the special... $40 for an app or salad, a pizza, dessert and a bottle of wine. Plenty of food for two and everything was spectacular. Started with calamari, Brassacre pizza (Brussels sprouts and Nueske's bacon) and chocolate mousse. A lovely medium bodied red wine rounded it out. The other couple had the always beautiful and tasty market salad, the Finnochio pizza, and the mousse. Their meal also won rave reviews. Service was excellent.  Grandpa's is reliable. The quality of the ingredients shines through and the preparations respect the ingredients but stretch your imagination.  5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Two stars for this establishment. The food was ok, the service needs work. I avoided this place in the very beginning after a story emerged in the community about one of the staff members asking a nursing mother who fed her child in the restaurant to \"go somewhere else to feed her child\". So, having that scene in the back of my mind, I already had a poor taste in my mouth for this place. Way to open your doors to the community! Though the manager had issued an apology, I was still appalled that something like this happened on Willy Street in Madison WI. Can you find a more liberal location in the world to raise children? Come on - Willy Street, you guys. Moreover, the pizza was actually not bad. The place is definitely conservative and not at all in the location it should to be. I went with some of my friends that are a part of the LGBT community, as am I, because again - Madison WI - Willy Street = love all around, and the wait staff seemed incredibly judgmental and crass - they totally hustle you out.  I will go back, because I will try anything multiple times, but I will make sure to act like a straight woman without babies to feed. Maybe then I will enjoy my time a bit more!"}
{"text":"One of the top pizzerias in town. This is not your typical American pizza. The crust is Napolitano style - thin crust, crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside - backed in a regular oven, not wood fired. Toppings are inventive, fresh and local. My favorite is the Brassacre - roasted Brussel sprouts, bacon and garlic. The sticky ginger cake is worth saving room for dessert.   With  small plates and pizza, the menu is short, and the wine list is equally focused. No mixed drinks, but Gibs, the next door bar of the same owners, is exceptional for drinks before or after dinner.   Interior is cozy, a little industrial with farm-like weathered wood, bare-bulb lighting and a copper bar. Service was spot on (fast and friendly) for a pizzeria. The place is small, so arrive early or make a reservation (I believe reservations can be made on selected nights only)."}
{"text":"Two of my favorite places in Madison are Pizza Brutta and Brasserie V. Grampa's Pizzeria is what would happen if my two favorite's had baby, who grew up to be a 20-something hipster who would obviously live on Willy Street and turn the farm-to-table up to 11.   So far so good. But as with many 20-somethings, a little age and wisdom will do wonders to take Grampa's from 4 stars to 5. There's really only one thing I would change - the crust is a little flat and boring and could use some complexity. A minor quibble, maybe, but you know - it is a pizza place...it's pretty important to nail crust. But perhaps that's a skill that you develop in your 30's."}
{"text":"The wait was LOOONG, but definitely worth it. We put our name on the list, then went down a few streets to State Line distillery, then wandered back to Gibs before finally being called back to Gampa's. But the food was delicious and I love the cozy ambiance of the restaurant. We tried a couple of the vegetarian pizzas and were not disappointed! The beet salad was also delicious. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow. I had Grampa's for my first time and it is my new favorite pizza place... possibly anywhere. Super fun combinations of toppings and the crust is almost like a crispy cracker. We had pizza with Brussels sprouts and thick cut bacon, could not get better than that! We will be returning frequently!"}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant. The pizza choices are very unique and delicious.  They have more than just pepperoni and sausage here.   Their unique pizzas are worth a try.  We started off the meal with some mozzarella cheese as an appetizer and it was fantastic!  Their wine list is extensive as well.  You definitely must try Grampa's Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Let me get to the quick of it: the only two saving graces of our meal were the dessert and the water, and we only got a decent dessert because we asked the table next to us what to get, and they recommended we NOT get the sticky ginger cake, which they said was bland.  We had two appetizers and two pizzas, one on a gluten free crust.  I found none of these four dishes to be pleasant, and that's crazy, because one was a carnitas-topped pizza.  If you knew how much I adore pulled pork...  I much prefer Roman Candle, just a couple blocks further down WIlly St.  The staff is less haughty, too.  Seriously, the coolest thing about this place is that they flavor their water with lemon, lime, and cucumber.  Stay away."}
{"text":"The BEST pizza in all of Madison and the world. Really. Be prepared to wait a while for a table. Go next door to Crystal Corner for a cheap brew. Well worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Finally!! After weeks of trying to eat here, I was able to grab a table for three on a Tuesday night, after only about a half hour wait. The previous two attempts had an estimated wait of 2 hours. The space is small, the place is popular, and they don't take reservations.   I came with two lovely ladies for Tuesday's date night, which started off grumpy because of rush hour traffic, a rain storm catching me sans umbrella, and difficulty/stress finding parking. But the experience at Grampa's made it all worth it.   The inside was cozy, with attention to details that add to its romance, like the yellowed books and fresh flowers at the window sills. As a party of three, we added a second pizza to the date night special, which includes a bottle of red or white, 1 app, 1 pizza, and 1 dessert to share for $40. Strangely the special didn't seem to be listed on their website or anywhere else; we heard through word of mouth, showed up, and it turned out to be true.   These are not your average pizzas. The bacon was meaty and smoky. The flavors contrasting, with bitter, floral, sweet, tart, savory, and the different textures of creamy and crispy. We chose the white that night, which turned out to be a new Sauvignon Blanc I hadn't tried, and paired perfectly with our meal. We didn't have room for the ginger cake at the end, but we devoured it anyway, along with the surprise macarons at the end.   Despite all it took to get here, this place was definitely worth the attempts. The servers are knowledgeable and you don't feel rushed (which is probably why the wait tends to be long). Cheers to you if you can can grab a table, and bad luck if it takes you multiple tries like me, but in the end it was a pursuit worth making."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a few weeks back while visiting family and my cousin said how amazing the pizzas are and that I had to try it!  And I fell in love with the place, love that all the pizzas have some kind of unique ingredient on it.  Now, I don't remember the name of the pizza I got...but...it was fantastic. It had spicy peppers, kale, and honey drizzle on the top and goat cheese I believe it was.  And had a great Oberon on draft.   When we stopped in, it was pretty busy and the wait was about 45 minutes long...but it was worth the wait. Met a few people while we waited and heard about the history of the building and what it use to be. We got sat at the very back of the place along the windows looking out to the herb garden. The hosts and waitress we had were great!"}
{"text":"Grandpa's is outstanding. There is a wait because it is that good. Fresh local ingredients, great staff, amazing warm atmosphere and more than anything, the food. This place is so much more than pizza. From the pork confit, to the beet salad, and of course the pizza... Fantastic. Best in Madison."}
{"text":"I love grandpa's so much!!!! And their owners are fantastic.  Tip: It's all about the sticky ginger cake."}
{"text":"Finally I had the chance to come and try the famous Grampa's pizza at the end of willy St. Just like the neighbour, Grampa's is also set up in a residential house turned into a business. It's very romantic, cozy and hip.  I was slightly surprised about the lack of a cocktail menu but they do have a good selections of wine.  Other than just pizza, they already have a number of small plates that are available and I went with the classic: olives (not on pizza though!). They came in a good portion and are pretty tasty!  The two of us decided to share a pizza as entrée. They serve what I call European style pizza, thin and crispy, my favorite. They have a few vegetarian options and a few with classic meat toppings.   We went with one that was really unique, which has ricotta, tomato sauce, peppers, watercress and honey. It was very very well done. The crust was very thin and crispy while the ingredients are fresh and make a very good flavor profile. I would love to come back and try their other selections, but sadly it might be my last memorable pizza I had in  Madison!"}
{"text":"I had been living in San Francisco, and my boyfriend in NYC, so we have trouble finding a place to eat in Madison that suits our coastal needs until we found Grampa's.  It is warm, cozy and nicely decorated, but that's not all, most importantly, the food is amazing.  Don't just get pizza.  The appetizers are superb and service is awesome! A must try for anyone in Madison! They know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"Great date night special on Tuesday! Small plate, pizza, dessert and a bottle of wine for $40! Delicious risotto with pea shoots--no doubt fresh from the garden out back. Brassacre pizza was delicious with a crisp, cracker-like crust. The dessert finale was a sticky ginger cake, slightly warmed, with a lemon and candied pistachio was blissful. Experience was made even better by Brett--waiter extraordinaire."}
{"text":"One if the best places I have been to in Madison so far. Everything made for a great experience--the service, the atmosphere, the food. My boyfriend and I decided on dinner at Grampa's after being turned away from a sold-out YumYum Fest. I had my heart set on going to the festival for a while and was skeptical that anything else could top the experience we would have had there, but I was wrong.   The interior of Grampa's is rustic and comfortable, and creates a friendly, relaxed atmosphere. The staff was friendly and attentive. We had an app and two salads to start--the caprese salad, lamb carpaccio, and melon salad with tomato water. The dishes were all new experiences to me. I most enjoyed the melon salad for its creativity and beautiful subtle flavors. Of course, after all that we had to get a pizza. The most delicious pepperoni pizza I have ever had! Its thin crust and addition of some green ingredient made it pretty outstanding... Not just your basic pepperoni.  And since we were doing it up to make up for missing YumYum Fest, we got the ginger cake for dessert. Yum! The cake was moist and the flavors were deliciously complex. The exterior of the cake had developed caramelized flavors, paired with a little zing from the ginger and creaminess from the whipped cream topping. And at the end, a nice crunch and nuttiness from the crushed pistachios. Yeah, you should order it.   After all that, both of us were comfortably full and happy from our dining experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"**All my reviews rate my experience AS A VEGAN eating at local Madison venues.**  I've eaten at Grampa's two times with a friend of mine. Both times have been for a the Tuesday night date menu. The Tuesday night date menu consists of a bottle of wine, a soup or salad, a pizza, and a dessert for a reasonable price. My date is an omnivore and I'm a vegan, and we love eating out together. With this menu, we split the wine, I get the salad, we make a half vegan/half non-vegan pizza request, and he gets the dessert since there are no vegan dessert options anyway.   The first time we ate at Grampa's I loved the atmosphere right off the bat. It's dim, cozy, and intimate in there, but not so tight that you feel like your neighbors are over hearing your conversation. On our first visit the waiter was easy-going enough about our odd request to split the pizza. The wine was delicious. The market salad was easy to make vegan (just hold the yogurt balls) and was absolutely stunning in both flavor, textures, and presentation. The pizza was yummy and filling. I just got the Finnochio, hold the cheese, and add some extra veggies that I saw elsewhere on the menu. Like I said, my date got all of the desert...the ginger cake, and he loved it! i do wish that there was a vegan option for us to share.   The next time we tried to go the wait was 90 minutes to two hours. Yikes! We were too hungry for that kind of wait so we had a delicious dinner across the street. A similar wait time awaited us on our next visit, but we were prepared and happy to sit at the bar and eat there. This time, our server seemed kind of irritated at our request to split and veganize the pizza. I get it...it's ordering off the menu which is never a favorite. But, I hate to feel like an annoyance when I go to eat, and I want to give my service to local places with a great atmosphere and delicious food, AND staff that are prepared to handle odd requests with a good attitude. We finally worked it out and the food was again DELICIOUS. We both feel satisfied, full, and wine-happy when we leave.   Overall, we love this place. The idea of Tuesday date night is fun and gives us something to look forward to midweek. The wait time keeps us from going every Tuesday. There are easier places to get vegan pizza and there are not vegan dessert options. In the end though, you're going to be happy with the quality of the food. So if you're vegan take that all into consideration and remember that the staff might or might not know what to do with your vegan requests."}
{"text":"What can I say?  AWESOME!  Best pizza in Madison!  You have to make this a must!  We are here every other week!"}
{"text":"We have visited a number of times and have had excellent service and amazing food every time. The pizza crust is thin (rivals the Greenbush for the best in town) and the toppings are exceptional. We love the Brassacre and the Barberini best. The pork confit appetizer is excellent too, and we've loved the salads and desserts as well. I love the atmosphere- very intimate and hip without trying too hard. Best of all, the service is consistently great- our servers have been warm and knowledgeable. I can't recommend this place highly enough!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner out with friends who were catching up after a year of not seeing one another. The establishment is quite small, and while I admit we got caught up talking, we were quite rudely asked to leave as other people needed our table. While we shouldn't have lingered, there were certainly kinder ways to approach the situation. My friend later emailed the owner simply to bring to his attention how the evening ended, and responded with:  \"I'm sure there are plenty of empty pizzerias that you and your friends can camp out in and talk about nonsense.\" Again, I understand they need to turn tables over, but given that we were seated around 5:45 (sat at the bar first) and I was in my car by 8pm, I didn't feel that reaction was necessary. In telling another friend the next day about what happened, she said that she a group of girlfriends had the same thing done to them. Obviously the restaurant needs to turn over tables quickly in order to stay profitable and keep customers happy, but there's got to be a more diplomatic way of handling the matter. For example, why not print a reminder on your menus, or train your staff to direct the guests to the bar. Instead, the owner has been rudely sending defensive emails to my friend that seem unacceptable communication between a business owner and his patrons. While the pizza was good, I won't be headed back."}
{"text":"This is a really good thin crust pizza. Crust is thin, nicely cooked with a crisp but still holds up the rest of pizza well.  We ordered the Barberini and really enjoyed the mix of peppers and honey. The ricotta and fresh watercress were a nice mixture of flavors as well. I could have done with fewer peppers as sometimes the spice masked over some of the other excellent flavors. One pizza was fairly satisfying for two people, but I'd probably recommend ordering an appetizer as well.   The staff were very friendly and welcoming. They also topped off the meal with a really nice little shortbread cookie."}
{"text":"The folks at Grampa's do an outstanding job of creating amazing flavors for pizza and other menu items. I have visited a few times, all for special events, and the food was incredible each time.   During my most recent visits, they hosted a tap takeover by Broadway Brewery in Columbia, Missouri the Thursday before Great Taste of the Midwest for a dinner event and again the Sunday after Great Taste for a special brunch. The Brewery staff also brought a lot of produce from their Missouri farm, which was incorporated into the menus.  Full disclosure, we are good friends with the Broadway Brewery Brewmaster and know the team there and their tastes and concepts, which we love, and we were so excited when we learned of their collaboration with Grampa's for these two events. They could not have had better partners.  The pizza at Grampa's is great. Let yourself sit back and enjoy their many offerings, including a pizza where brussel sprouts are a key ingredient. I've had the pleasure of tasting nearly all their typical pizza offerings, and you really cannot go wrong. The crust is thin, not quite a cracker crust, but thin enough to be an appropriate vehicle for the excellent ingredients on top and not drown out their flavor. Some pizza joints have such poor ingredients, you need the crust to make up for what lacks in topping flavor. Grampa's is far above this.  While the pizza is outstanding, I encourage patrons to try other menu options. their salads and risottos are also rich and flavorful, and unlike any other I have found in Madison.  While you wait, walk next door to Gib's bar (same owners) and enjoy a cocktail whilst lounging in one of their cozy spaces. The hostess at Grampa's will call you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place for my birthday dinner, and I really enjoyed it!  All 4 pizzas we tried were delicious. My favorites were the Pinnochio and the Goomba.  The prices were also not as high as I expected. The entire space is gorgeous, and our service was excellent.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We ran across this place after leaving our original place due to a long wait time and I'm so glad that we did! The restaurant is set up in an old house, with seating area in the living room part. The whole set up is pretty cute. And there's a nice little garden outside with a few plots and string lights. The overall seating area is pretty small but doesn't feel too cramped.   All of their pizzas are thin-crust. I got the Goomba (garlic cream sauce, mushrooms, herbs) and absolutely loved it. My friend got the Jabroni (tomato sauce, basil) and liked it, but she said that she would probably order mine instead if she came here again. I think the mushrooms made it heartier. Plus I enjoyed mind more because I had a sore throat and the Jabroni had just a tiny bit of a kick - enough to somewhat bother a sore throat. In the end, they gave us some complimentary meringues (I think that's what they were) so that was a nice little surprise!"}
{"text":"I am in love. This place smells freaking amazing from the second you walk in, the food is delicious, the service is great, what more do you demanding, picky people need?!?  It is also just so charming, so east side Madison. We went for the first time tonight and didn't have to wait at all at 6:30 on a Thursday. The dumplings were fragrant and lovely, the Pinnochio pizza was super tasty (if you don't eat sausage what the heck is wrong with you? This sausage was insanely flavorful), and the DESSERT. Omg the dessert. We shared the sticky ginger cake which was topped with an enormous lovely mound of lemon cream, cinnamon & candied pistachios. We would've licked the plate if we coulda.    The service was also stellar (though slightly disturbing that all of the waitresses look like thin, long-haired brunette clones of each other).   It's small and cozy, so I bet there's frequently a wait. Well worth it. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night. Liked the dim lights and candles.  No wait. It was 9 on a Friday night and we were seated immediately.  The pizza was good but I like a thicker  hand tossed crust. If you like thin cracker crust this is for you.  I want to go back and try the salads and desert."}
{"text":"Grampa's Pizzeria - aptly named.  No one makes pizza quite like Grampa. It's delicious! He uses quality ingredients and bomb flavor combinations. Seriously, I love Grampa and I love his pizza.  However, my last visit to Grampa's made me wonder if he's maybe going senile. Walking in, we got a friendly, though confused look from the host that said, \"who are you and why are you here?\" That should probably have tipped me off that something was amiss. When we got an appetizer, it came out cold - I asked, \"Did you maybe forget to cook this pork?\" They poked it, shrugged, and put it back in the oven. Then finally, something happened with the pizza. I don't actually know what happened, our server just came out saying that it was going to be a while before we got to eat. But hey, Grampa is nothing if not generous! We got a free beer for all the confusion.  It's probably for the best that there were only 3 other couples in the restaurant. A busy Monday would have just gotten Grampa all flustered."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fresh ingredients were cut and arranged on the crust for bite after delicious bite. The crust was crisp and tasty, held the ingredients well. My pizza had sausage, fennel, and olives. House-made sausage was flavorful and well-seasoned. It tasted great with the pizza sauce and my toppings. My son ordered the Goomba because he loves mushrooms, and the hat tip to Mario is fun. He really liked the garlicky sauce and all the mushrooms. The decor is casual, nicely done. Nice wine list. I'd love to go back for girls' night out."}
{"text":"Finally came here with some friends last night. We ordered the Puerco (tomato sauce, pork confit, and gorgonzola) and the Brassacre (brussels, bacon, fresh mozzarella, olive oil, garlic, and grana). The prices were reasonable at around $15 a pie. The 2 pizzas were enough to feed the four of us, came out hot, and were delicious, although I will say I was a bigger fan of the Puerco. I thought the service was extremely attentive. My only real complaint is it was hard to talk as the place was a little loud, but that's true in a lot of places (so no big deal). The dessert was a little pricey ($9), but delicious (ordered a chocolate mousse). The street parking was completely manageable. In sum, I would definitely return to order more pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good and unique. I loved the super thin crust.  The service was good as well. The reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the dining room is really small.  My friend and I were finishing a conversation and decided to take it elsewhere because people were swarming around with that look in their eye that said \"we want your table!\".  It looks like they have a patio so summer dining would probably allow for more space."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, each time I've had to wait 30 minutes before getting a table.  On my most recent trip we were sitting in the cramped corner and we blew out the candle on the table. The waiter asked us why we blew it out and I let him know because it was bothering me. Due to the cramped space the waiter managed to bump into me and my chair about 5 times over the course of 20 minutes while we were waiting for our pizza. After the pizza is finally complete he drops it off and tells us \"he needs to light the candle\" and proceeds to light the candle knowing that it is bothersome to us. At that point we decided just to get a box and leave because we were so annoyed with his antics.  The crust is thin and basically flavorless, their sauce isn't anything special and their cheese is basic. Most of the items on the menu are about $2 overpriced, the space is cramped and the customer service is also unimpressive.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and DELICIOUS pork confit app!! This is a great reasonably-priced neighborhood option: check was around $100 for five with three apps, three pizzas and a beer for each. I'd say go for beer over wine. Good spot; I shall return."}
{"text":"Best beet salad this side of the Mississippi. Fun environment, friendly staff. Be ready for a wait, but you can find a spot at the bar or head down the street and they'll give you a call. Great spot!  Wouldn't suggest the take out."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza in Madison.  It kinda ruins eating at other places. You can order any of the great options off the menu, and they are happy to customize if you know what you want.   Esy on street parking. There is often a wait, and you can go next door to Gibs and get a drink."}
{"text":"This place has the most lovely atmosphere. Service was great. Loved the egg gremolata botarga."}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere and most importantly great food! Always great for a night out with friends or taking coworkers out for dinner."}
{"text":"Grampa's is my favorite pizza place in Madison. Such a great atmosphere perfect for date night! Amazzzzing food and great drinks! Staff is always very welcoming and knowledgeable too."}
{"text":"Grampa's has been one of my go-to's for the last 9 months. There is almost always a 20-30 minute wait, but you can go to Gib's next door while you wait and grab a drink from the bar. It's a small 15 seat, dimly light venue with a nice garden out back (unfortunately, no outdoor seating).   The cheese board is a consistent crowd pleaser, with regularly rotating local cheeses, honeys and jams.   Our favorite pizzas have been the Finochio and the Barberini. The Finochio is a spicy, red sauce pizza with Italian sausage, and green peppers. It can be a bit greasy at times, but it hasn't detoured us from getting it time and time again. The Barberini is a red sauce pizza, with chunks of ricotta, red chile peppers, watercress, arugula, and a honey drizzle. It can be a bit spicy as well but has been loved by everyone I've gone to Grampa's with.  Grampa's is a true staple of Willy Street."}
{"text":"Grampa's Pizza is pretty much the best pizza I have had in Madison, and I am a pretty big pizza fanatic! We stumbled upon Grampa's Pizza while using Yelp to try out some of the top Pizza places and were not disappointed. The ingredients are really fresh, the atmosphere is quite inviting and cozy, and the macaroons at end of the meal are perfect! There is a bit of a wait at key times and they do not take reservations, so it is best to go early, put your name on the list and then check out the rest of what Willy Street has to offer while you wait! Grampa's is a most if you are a pizza lover."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Madison. The pizza is great & I loved the cheese board! I recommend going on their \"date night\" for a deal & the opportunity to try more of the food! The space has a great vibe, but is fairly small so anticipate having to wait. In my opinion, the wait is well worth it."}
{"text":"Grampa's is a hip place from the inside out: an old brick building with beautiful refinished flooring, accompanied with windows throughout their guest seating that overlook Grampa's own herb garden out back. Now, a lot of places have the 'it' factor on the outside - mainly pouring all of their creative energy in an appearance that just doesn't justify their uninspired product. I can gladly say that Grampa's delivers on all fronts. There is heart in their food, there is a server, as genuine as they come, giving you excellent five star service, and there is a certain ambience that enables you to relax and share a pie or two with your friends.   I'd highly suggest their Goomba pizza. And check out their drink list! It's delicious."}
{"text":"Great place for a romantic date!   You know your food is fancy when it comes garnished with flower petals lol.  Dumplings - Not what I expected but they looked and tasted good. The broth/sauce that came with it paired nicely.   Pork confit - Lots of flavors here for a well crafted pork appetizer.   Goomba pizza - Loved this. It wasn't too meat heavy which was a nice match after the meaty appetizer.   The atmosphere, somewhat quiet with soft lighting, encourages intimacy and conversation.   Service was good - this was expected.   They gave us 2 cookies to take home.   Overall solid restaurant for any dinner date."}
{"text":"Grandpa's is one of those places where you get the sense that anything you order will be delicious. My husband and I went on a Monday night for our anniversary. Every table was full, and the atmosphere was very homey and romantic. We ordered the pork confit, which was unexpected and flavorful. We also got the market salad. The salad was so fresh and wonderful. Finally, we got the daily special pizza, which had chorizo and corn and shishito peppers. It was also quite tasty. We only wish the crust in the center section of the pizza were crispier. Overall, it was an amazing dinner, and we had a great time. Can't wait to go again soon!"}
{"text":"Although we all miss walking past Grampa's gun shop on willy st while surveying the crop of handguns that were in for cleaning, I think we can agree that the new Grampa's has filled the holster of years past with amazing food.  The pork confit continues to amaze me - if I can ever make something like this at home, I will be a culinary god. Risotto was also a nice touch to start off with. The cheese plate was a bit small and underwhelming & the mozzarella app was boring.   Their thin-crust pizzas are really the star of the show and is what is keeping people coming back. Really creative menu and almost all of their pizzas taste amazing, but you can build your own (with an exhaustive list of meats and toppings). After several iterations, I've mastered the ratio of humans to pizza: 0.8 pizzas per person +/-hunger factor +/- apps.   My only two issues with grampa is that I can never wait until the pizzas cool down (currently recovering from a burnt mouth) and they need a more accessible wine list (it is $39 for cheapest bottle of red wine), or they should introduce a house red."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here last night for our 2 year anniversary. We had been meaning to try it out for awhile, and I was so excited to learn that this was where we were going! He had called earlier in the day and attempted to make a reservation, and was told that he had been put on a list. However, upon arrival we were told that they don't make reservations, and his name was nowhere to be found. Thankfully the wait time was only about 15 minutes. This didn't bother me any, but because he was doing something romantic for our anniversary I can understand his frustration.  We were pleasantly surprised when the waiter informed us that Tuesdays are Date Night! (He had also asked on his phone call earlier in the day if they had anything special going on that night and was told they didn't.) With a choice of a small plate or salad, pizza, dessert and a wine all to split for $40.00, you can't go wrong!  We got the cheese board, the Jabroni Pizza, The Sticky Ginger cake, and a bottle of Zin. We both thoroughly enjoyed everything, and almost forgot to make room for dessert. The Ginger cake is the best thing. The BEST. Our waiter was also very informative and friendly. I have a peanut allergy, so he did his best to make sure that any and all nuts were okay.  The one complaint that I did have is that it gets very noisy. It's very small and cozy and the environment is really nice, but it's very difficult to have a conversation without talking over everyone. Aside from that, it might be our new date night spot!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is gorgeous. A little hole in the wall with candles on the tables and dim, romantic lighting. We shared a pizza between 3 people and 2 mini plates. It was perfect. We ordered the mozzarella plate and the pesto pizza. Everything was really good."}
{"text":"Kids new favorite pizza place!  Thin crust pepperoni pizza...yummo!  Cute place...expect a wait."}
{"text":"great pizza flavor combos, fun date night special pricing, nice beer list."}
{"text":"We did the pork confit, the calamari and we shared a pizza (I'd say the finocchio - which should be spelled with only one n not two).  The pork confit was fine, the calamari were outstanding and the pizza was delicious. Elaborating further, the pork confit was good all melty and fatty and with a nice little sauce to go with it, but did not impress me as something special. The calamari were perfect: tender and with a spicy filling that perfectly complements the delicate flavor of the calamari without overpowering them. The pizza was one of the ones I like: thin, crispy and topped with flavorful ingredients. If I have to criticize something I would say that the pizza was maybe a tad too topped for my taste, but I tend to gravitate towards simpler flavors.   Anyway, I think I will go back as I would be very curious to try the Barberini and even more the Goomba."}
{"text":"Grampa's is one of my go-to spots here in Madison when friends and family are visiting.  The interior is perfect for conjuring a warm, relaxed vibe.  Service is excellent.  I am a big fan of the Barberini - highly recommend to those looking for a pizza with a kick."}
{"text":"Yummy thin crust pizza in cozy atmosphere. The Market salad was excellent! A great inexpensive, relaxing date night place. They have a nice garden in the \"backyard\" were it looks like they grow their own herbs. It was dark, so hard to tell if there were veggies. We split a salad and pizza (as another reviewer mentioned, it's almost on the flatbread end, but still good) and had a glass of wine and left happy. Since we got there pretty late - around 10pm - there was no wait and it was not crowded."}
{"text":"The pizza is alright, there was nothing so fantastic about it that I would go back specifically for it. The edges were a bit too \"brown\" (read: burnt) for my taste. Madison is a town filled with specialty and unique pizza shops and I'll take a slice of Ian's any day over a burnt crispy grampas slice."}
{"text":"I'd go back for the lovely decor and the friendly service, but not for the food.   A friend and I ordered a specialty pizza off of their menu. It was a riskier choice, I'll admit, with gorgonzola and honey (I no longer see it on the current menu, by the way), but it sounded interesting. We both decided after a few bites that it just wasn't for us, and asked our waitress if we could please send this one back and order a new pizza. We stressed that we would pay for both pizzas, since it just wasn't really to our liking, but the waitress (and then the manager) insisted that the replacement pizza would be in the house. It was a really nice gesture on their part. We appreciated it.   We went with a nice, plain pizza for our replacement. Unfortunately, that's when we realized that the crust, while better than say a Pizza Hut crust, was a little disappointing compared to Naples15 or Salvatore's. And the sauce tasted unpleasantly sweet to us.   It's a beautiful restaurant, though, and I'd be willing to give it a second chance sometime. I'd just order something other than pizza."}
{"text":"Fantastic salads, vegetable dishes, cocktails and of course pizza.  Very creative, a total foodie-joint.  Was full at 5:30pm on a Thursday."}
{"text":"We came here on an impromptu date night last night.  The last time we were here, it was very busy, so we had to go somewhere else.  Luckily we got in right away!  The table we were seated at was a small table between two other tables, next to the window.  There was a nice view of the garden that I'm sure they make use of in the summer.  We ordered the pork confit as the starter.  The confit was so delicious!  We really enjoyed it with the mustard, chimichurri, giadiniera and bread.  I'm pretty sure we would have sopped up the juices in the pan if we would have had any bread left.  We ordered the Brassacre pizza as well.  This pizza had Brussels sprouts, bacon and mozzarella.  It was amazing!  This is probably my favorite pizza topping ever.  The server was very attentive, and was very pleasant.  He twisted our arm (which was not difficult), and we ordered the ginger cake to share.  This was so good, and I think we may have fought over the last crumbs.  I'm so glad we were finally able to eat here, and am looking forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"Setting = A Pork Confit = A+ Cheese Board = A Pizza = A+ Wine = A Service = A-  Get there early or wait a long time."}
{"text":"Most definitely one of the top 3 restaurants in Madison. The chef-owner, Gil, is truly gifted and you should try his small plates. His dishes are conceived with taste and freshness and beauty in mind.  The seasonal \"Charred ramps\" was FANTASTIC. (Ramps are wild spring onions.) Ramps with slight char, served on a board with fried anchovies, a fried egg and a few cherry tomatoes. It was sort of like a deconstructed Caesar salad, but made with sweet charred onions. Amazing.  The beet salad - well-described in other reviews was stunning and Delish.  The dumplings, stuffed with chicken, were topped with a round of fois gras! Served with a light broth and a sprinkle of watercress. Oh yum.  The pork confit was served in a smokin' hot cast-iron skillet, so that the roasted pork got slightly crispy on the bottom. This came with stone-ground mustard, crusty bread and a jalapeno pickle salad. Heaven.  The chocolate mousse, with coffee and cardamom was the lightest I have had in many years.  Served with caramel tuilles - a gorgeous presentation.  They have a great wine list- too - with CMS as their house wine.  You could go here for beer and pizza - but why?  The service was perfect. Serious, well-timed and impeccable.  Grampa's is very small. Therefore, you have to go early to get a table or be prepared to wait next door at Gib's (the house bar next door)."}
{"text":"Finally, finally got to this place with my husband after hearing a lot of people talk about how fantastic it is.  We were pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere and the vibe; it was much better than we were expecting.  Lights were dimmed perfect and it had a nice cozy feel.  The tables seemed really close together, but I suppose that comes with being a tiny place.  Shockingly it never got too loud which we both really appreciated.  We shared a delicious tomato salad as an appetizer which was a nice non-classic salad (no lettuce or spinach or anything) and the Pinocchio pizza.  I can't say we were absolutely blown away by the pizza, but it was very, very good.  And different!  That was the best part.  You won't find pizzas like theirs anywhere else.  We're definitely fans and would come back - it would be a nice spot to bring out of town guests too I think!"}
{"text":"Great service, fair prices, amazing and freshly grown ingredients in their own garden, and Underground meats. Enough said!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've had in Madison hands down. The ambiance, food, and drink were just delightful!   There was no wait on a Monday night and we were seated in the main room which was pleasantly busy, though still quiet enough to chat. So it was perfect for a date night or catch up.   The food was bomb dot com. The pork confit lived up to the hype, cooked to tender perfection and served in the cutest mini cast iron skillet. The pizza was amazing--perfect blend of pesto and tomato sauce with super delicious cheese and meats.  I'm pretty picky about pizza, but the thin crust here was awesome.   The food is reasonably priced given quality and spectacular mouth-exploding taste. The wine menu is definitely a bit pricey, but worth it. Even the lower priced bottles still pair really well with their food.   All in all a great meal that I would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great. It used to be grandpa's gun shop. Which we always found to be a humorous name. Now it's a sweet pizza place with a similar name.  I'm not sure how they cook their pizzas but they seem to be cooked on stone or with wood. Good beer selection."}
{"text":"Great wine list! Amazing pizza! Got the brussel sprout and bacon pizza, sounds strange, but was to die for!"}
{"text":"I've been here a ton but was hesitant to review because of some unevenness across different criteria. Overall, I think Grandpa's is great for the following reasons. First, and most importantly, the ginger cake is the best dessert in Madison (and maybe the Midwest writ large). If you disagree with me on this point, you are objectively wrong. I can go into specifics and sing its praises in 1000 ways, but let's just say that the cake is gustatory poetry. It is ethereal. It is divine. It is unmatched by any flourless chocolate cake or other such pathetic competitors. Second, the environment is perfect and fills a gap in cool, intimate restaurant spaces in town. The very professional wait staff only helps. Third, the date night special can't be beat. Merchant and Tex Tubbs Taco Palace also have date nights but both pale in comparison. (Merchant's menu involves little to no choice and comes with a heaping dose of attitude.) The cons: the pizza is really not that great. Compared to Sal's, the crust is nothing to write home about. Many of the toppings are well chosen and executed (brussels sprouts and bacon!), but some fall flat (the pesto - meh). On pizza alone, Sal's is a cut above.  All that said, Grandpa's comes out lookin' pretty good because the appetizers are good, the desserts are divine (the mousse is fabulous although it's hard to wrench me away from the ginger cake), the service is slick, etc. I hope this place keeps chuggin'!"}
{"text":"I'm not from Madison so Grampa's was suggested to me by a local. Since I'm in town on business, it was dinner for one when I showed up on a Tuesday evening. I ALMOST missed out on the wonders of this place because the outside lights were off when I showed up; I thought it was closed. Thankfully, I walked up to find that not only was the restaurant open, but it offered a quaint, warm and inviting ambience. I sat at the bar and decided to do a \"tasting menu\" where I ordered a salad and a couple of appetizers. Beet salad over a pistachio pureé topped with greens, cured olives and a truly unique risotto with fennel and celery root. All that with a glass of red wine and a welcome conversation with the very friendly bartender/server made for an excellent meal. As a topper, the server handed me a little brown bag with my check. She said they were a couple of cookies to go. So, I'm not normally a fan of merengue type cookies but I was in the mood for something sweet. Decided to give one a try and quickly declared these cookies crack...instantly addictive! Holy hell, I would return to Grampa's just for the cookies and exceptional service, but I've got more of the menu to get through before I leave Madison."}
{"text":"We had been anticipating going to grampas for a few months and got there right when it opened last Thursday to avoid any rush.  We came with extended family fresh from the airport and our 3 year old daughter.  First off, they have no high chairs.  So not only is it not child friendly, they blatantly discourage them.  And it's a pizza place.  Pizza.  Our server was one of the only nice people we encountered while there- she may have missed the pretension training and the anti-smile campaign.  The food was pretty good- I actually liked the risotto better than any of the 4 pizzas we had.  I found them to be on the greasy and salty side.  For my $, Pizza  Brutta is still the best in Madison.  I don't think I'd go back to grampas, even if we got a babysitter."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best pizza places in Madison in terms of the quality of food, price, ambiance and service. The only potential con is the wait. But there's a bar right next door you can drink at until your table is ready!  It's a place you can go with friends to split a (few) pizzas or somewhere to go on a date night. Alcohol selection (in terms of beer and wine) is good.   There's not much left to say about Granpa's except it's a great all-around restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Excellent appetizers are always rotating - this last time we tried the chicken dumplings and they were presented so nicely and tasted even better. The pizza here is always amazing and fresh! Don't go if you don't appreciate a good thin crust pizza. Our lovely server was extremely attentive and also convinced us to try that night's special dessert, a lemon tarte with fresh blueberries, mint, and sea salt - this was so good I have no words. I'm sad it's not a regular dessert option!   Aside from the food, Grampa's has an adorable ambiance that combines old school with modern decor. My favorite date night spot in Madison. My only complaint is how long the wait time always is - BUT the owners graciously opened Gibs next door, so you can go to yet another great gen and grab a drink while you wait. This place is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've never had a worse experience. They told us it was a two hour wait when we put our names on the list. Two and a half hours later we went to check in and see what was going on and she said it was still going to be another half hour. Everyone on the list before us was crossed off including four names after us. At that point we just ordered to go but that was after wasting two and a half hours of our night.   It was extremely disappointing to come all the way from out of town to experience such poor customer service. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We had a great experience tonight during our first trip to Grandpa's.  Not only was each course prepared to perfection and flavor-packed, but the atmosphere was exactly the \"upscale pizzeria\" vibe that we were hoping for.  They had interesting beer on tap and very personable staff; we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"As other reviews state, GET HERE EARLY (they open daily at 5PM!). My party of five had to wait for about 45 min next door at Gib's (how'd I miss seeing Gib's on my many drives up and down Willy St??), which was also VERY crowded and not easy to find a place for five to sit (Gib's serves craft cocktails, wines, and craft beers). Once finally inside of Grampa's, it was quite cozy with very limited seating, hence the lengthy wait. We all ordered our own pizzas, which really serve one well with a little to take home. I had the Barberini, which had the most amazing crust I've ever had! Thin and crisp with perfect texture! The toppings were so fresh and unique (watercress & honey! Wow!!!). My companions ordered the Finocchio, Jabroni, Goomba, and Peperoni. I'm not much of a meat topping fan, but the Peperoni was devine! My compadres were equally happy with the pizzas they ordered and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came on a tuesday at 6pm. There was a 20 minute wait for a table, but the bar was empty so i sat there.  This is my 4th time at Grampas. Theyre the best pizza I've had in Madison so far.  I always start off my meal with the beet salad. I think their beet salad is heavenly. They follow the common base formula of cooled roasted beets, chevre (soft goat cheese), and pistachio, but I think they do it the best. The pistachios are pureed, the beets are diced on top of the puree, the goat cheese has truffle added before being dispersed in small lumps throughout the plate, and it's topped with pea shoots. Seriously, this thing is a masterpiece. The pistachio puree is creamy, smoky, and salty. The beets are cool, sweet, soft, and slightly chocolatey in my opinion. The chevre is tangy with an earthy, oily flavor (probably the truffle?). The pea shoots are like watercress that taste like pea pods with a certain crunchy sweetness. Get all of this in one bite for a flavor experience!  This time around, i ordered the Brassacre and the Jabroni.  The Brassacre is my favorite. Thick cube-like chunks of smoky bacon and hard italian cheese go over individual brussel sprout leaves with a drizzle of olive oil. The olive oil seems to carry the sweet flavor of the brussel sprout leaves throughout the pizza. Since the brussel sprouts are separated into individual leaves, you get some crispy burnt ones (my favorite) and some thin cabbage-like ones. These different textures really go well with the thick chunks of chewy bacon. I really cant describe why all these flavors work well together, but they do. Give it a try! I think the end pieces are the best for this one since the olive oil tastes better on the crunchy part of the crust.  The Jabroni is also great. Freshly sliced basil is the first thing you taste. Its bright, volatile flavor quickly descends into a dark, mysterious flavor coming from the sauce's mixture of pesto and tomato sauce with a peppery kick at the end. For this one, i like the middle pieces the best since the soft crust seamlessly matches the texture of the sauce.  I'm from Chicago, so I will always love Lou Malnati's the best, but this is excellent pizza too. Their flavors are so thought-provoking!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit here.  We came after a very casual day while visiting a festival at the area park.  We felt under dressed.  We ordered one salad ($8.50) which we felt was very over priced for the amount you received.  We also ordered two pizzas.  The pizzas are very thin crust and are 12' in size.  The ingredients were unique and the average cost is $13.00 a pizza.  You would need to order several if you expect to get full from eating this pizza.  We finished with their cake and I would say this is their best item.  It was delicious.  The cost per piece is $6.00 but this item is the only item we found to be a large serving.    We had a nice experience but found it to be expensive for what you receive and would recommend other local establishments before suggesting coming here."}
{"text":"Call at least a day ahead for a reservation; they don't do same-day reservations and there is always a wait. If you get there early enough to get a seat at the bar, the wait is enjoyable.  I LOVE the whole experience of Grampa's. The lighting, the decor and the view of the garden give a very intimate and comfortable atmosphere. I also love that they finish the meal with complementary macarons. I'm never going to save enough room to order dessert when I go to Grampa's, but if it comes with the check I will gladly take it.  The brassacre pizza was very memorable. Brussels and thick-cut bacon are always a winning combination, and the pizza held up even though it was a thinner crust."}
{"text":"GET HERE EARLY if you want to actually eat here for the night. Luckily, they send people over to Gib's while you wait, which is a fancy house dressed up as a bar. So it's not too bad while you're waiting... check out my review from Gibs if you want to read more!  Gourmet appetizers and pizzas here! The hostess was on top of things even though there were so many people trying to get a table. They serve thin crust pizzas here. All and Every decision is the right decision. You just honestly can't go wrong here! Happy Munching!"}
{"text":"Grampa's is an exceptional experience. We have been here twice and both visits have been lovely. It provides a dark and intimate setting. Tuesday is date night; the price includes an appetizer, pizza, dessert and a bottle of wine. Perfect!  We have tried both the brassecre pizza and the barberini pizza. Both are wonderful, but the Barberini had many complex flavors that made it quite special. It is very saucy, but the honey and creamy cheese add layers of smoothness to the spice of the sauce. The cheese board is a great starter with a bottle of wine. The sticky ginger cake is literally the BEST dessert I have ever had. In addition, the music is perfectly suited to the atmosphere, featuring Billie Holiday and French songstresses. Yes, you have to wait for a table but it is more than worth it. It may even be part of what makes the experience special."}
{"text":"What is pizza? If it doesn't have cheese, is it be pizza? What about no tomato sauce? Are flatbreads pizzas? These are the sort of philosophical questions that you stop asking yourself after you bite into a slice of Grampa's. I lived for a stint in New Haven, where pizza is a religion and which denomination/restaurant you prefer speaks about the state of your soul. Grampa's pizzas really stretch the definition of what is pizza. I mean it's Willy Street, what would you expect? I had the \"Brassacre\" (BRASS-acre? BRASS-a-ker? Bra-SACR?), which involved brussels sprouts, bacon, olive oil, and garlic. Incredibly flavorful, and the bacon+garlic+olive oil was phenomenally fragrant. The wait was really long, but guess what? Leave your number, then pop over next door to Gib's, my favorite bar in all of Madison, and enjoy a libation until they call you! And while I didn't get to take a close look, it seems that they have an extensive wine menu that a lot of patrons enjoyed. Cocktails, wine, pizza - I can't imagine a holier trinity."}
{"text":"We came here for Mothers Day and were quite pleased with our meal! The food all came out promptly and the chef was able to meet the accommodations our group requested (olives on the side, chiles on half). We had 3 pizzas for a group of 5, which was just enough. We also ordered the mozzarella appetizer which I liked, but was not as big of a hit for others in our group. Good drink selection, and the coke bottles were adorable (perfect for Mother's Day!) service was efficient, knowledgeable, and kind!  The only thing keeping Grampas from 5 stars was it was a little tough to go to with a large group. While my husband and I are pretty adventurous, the group we were with really likes their SMO pizza and garlic bread. While the unique ingredients on the pizza is something I love about the place, it was hard to sell it to the rest of our party. All the food ended up being delicious, but it was a bit awkward choosing what to order when your party is used to traditional pizza joints. We will be back!"}
{"text":"What a treat! First, the ambience is just lovely. Cozy, intimate, and simple! We had our dinner by candlelight. The 30 minute wait (typical for a Saturday night) was worth it!   First, we had the Calamari appetizer (calamari stuffed with chorizo, tomato purée) was interesting! It was different and flavorful - I don't know if we'd order it again but it was a nice introduction to our wonderful meal. We, then, had the market salad with seasonal veggies from their garden (out in the back). It was so refreshing!   Finally, we had the Barberini Pizza (check out their website for ingredient deets)! At first I wasn't sure about the pizza because of  the drizzled honey but it was GREAT! Just the perfect mix of a variety of flavors (sweetness and spiciness)!   As we paid the check, they handed us complimentary homemade Macaroons! The service was also WARM AND FRIENDLY! I highly recommend this for a romantic, date night or a fun night out with close friends or family!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizzeria in Madison, probably the country. The ambiance is so nice and they do a great job at making you feel comfortable and not too close to the other tables. The pizza is amazing, I can't even say my favorite because it changes every time I go, which is at least every other week.   Not only are the pizzas great, but so are the apps. Burrata, octopus, scallops, are just a few examples that change all the time. And you cannot go wrong with any of them.  If you have the time (since there's usually a wait), you definitely should check this out! Even if you have to wait, you can head over to gibs next door for a drink and they'll call you over when a table is available."}
{"text":"I went into Grampa's Pizzeria really, really wanting to LOVE it and came out with feelings of it being just ok. I love the interior, the ambiance and the thoughtful lighting & decoration. The bar is unique & fun with an industrial-looking tile back splash & vintage gold mirrors hanging off it. The Edison light bulbs in fixtures along the wall with no shades were great & continued the vintage theme. We arrived at 5:45 so it was fairly quiet. As it got busier the noise levels were pretty significant. The tables are in close quarters so I was glad to be leaving as things were getting really busy and much louder.  I started with a small plate of the brussel sprouts & bacon - great flavor & texture with just the right amount of oil served in a tiny cast iron pan. There was no salt or pepper on the table and I didn't ask for it, but in hindsight, I would have enjoyed a bit of both.  I chose the basic pie with sausage. I really enjoyed the cracker thin crust with just the right amount of crunch. I didn't enjoy the sauce - it was too spicy for me & more acidic than most. I also wished there was just a bit more cheese. The sausage had great texture and flavor. My mom had a pizza with pesto instead of tomato sauce and I liked that so much I'll probably go with that the next time I'm there.  I had a couple bites of my friend's sticky ginger cake. It was very tasty! The cake was light and flavorful. It was topped with a big pillow of homemade whipped cream that was just perfect. I would highly recommend trying that.  We had asked our server at the start to please separate our checks. He said he would, but he just brought the one, made some excuse we couldn't hear over the din and walked away. We were a bit frustrated so when he came back later, we asked him again to please separate them out. He said of course and came back with separate checks with apologies that he'd gotten so busy and forgot to do what we'd initially asked him to do.  So all was well. Overall, we had a really nice time & enjoyed the food. I will likely go back again sometime, but I can't ignore that it did fall a bit short of my expectations."}
{"text":"Fresh local flavors and a welcoming space!    I was surprised at the tasteful interior given that the restaurant was formerly a residential home: despite being a smaller restaurant, the interior was roomy and windows into the homey backyard provided a nice view.  Our server was great--he ensured our table had everything we needed without being intrusive.  As for the pizza, the Brassacre has an excellent ratio of cheese/brussel sprout/thick cut bacon.  Every slice is consistently good and the flavors are extremely balanced. Both the bacon and the brussel sprouts provide crispiness without being burnt. Normally I would not order a brussel sprout pizza, but I first tried this at the Yelp Pizza Bracket 2014 (BTW, Brassacre got city-wide 2nd place!).   Next was the pizza of the day: sweet corn pizza with epazote, Marisa cheese, shishitos, chorizo and chili oil.  This pizza was good ,but a little inconsistent. Some slices were much better than others (I think some were lacking corn), but overall, it was very tasty.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"After our meal last night, my girlfriend and I probably asked the same question to each other, \"Why don't we come here more often?\" to which we have no good reason.  What I do know is that we will be back (and back again and back again) in the future.  On Tuesdays, they offer date night-Shared appetizer, dessert, pizza and a bottle of wine for $45.  Not only is that a great deal by itself but the food was amazing.  We opted for the beet salad for our appetizer and it was great.  Beets, truffle goat cheese, pea shoots.  Perfectly balanced and delightful.  Pizza was we excellent as well.  We went with the finnochio and didn't leave a piece behind.  For dessert, we selected the spiced ginger cake.  Although we were already full, the lightness of the cake and the flavor was something we couldn't put down.  Wash it down with a bottle of wine and call us very satisfied customers.   A great restaurant in a great neighborhood in a great city.  You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I brought back some California goodies for my friend and in return he took me out to Grampa's Pizzeria. Definitely a fair trade.   When I first walked into Grampa's I was surprised at how cozy and romantic the place is. It feels like you're eating dinner in a house that was converted into a restaurant.   Enough about the ambiance, let's talk pizza. OH. MY. GOD. So thin, so good, so perfect. I can't remember the name of the pizza we got, but it had sausages which packed some heat. Gramps really knows how to do thin crust well. The crust is thin and crispy even with all the toppings on it.   Pizza is life. Grampa's you make my life complete."}
{"text":"I usually always go for wood fired pizza (or coal fired is even better), but Grampa's pizza is good enough to make an exception.  Never had a pizza here I didn't love.  Decent beer selection too.  Check out the converted Victorian next door for a drink while you wait for a table."}
{"text":"Wow! This is all I can say. I hope to come here much more often, from holiday specials to try out the unique menus to regular nights.   Came here for the Valentine's special and was blown away. Our reservation was pushed back a bit because the tables weren't ready yet, and we were sent over to Gib's to wait. It wasn't a good sign, but within 10 minutes or so we were called and seated. We had the special charcuterie board, lobster risotto, brassacre, ginger cake (by Yelp recommendations although the SO usually doesn't like ginger) and a bottle of chianti.  The charcuterie board was well done. I cannot comment on it much, as I realize I am not a connoisseur of many of the finer things in life: the cheeses consisted of an aged bleu cheese and a goat cheese brie, which overpowered my personal senses. I am not a fan of treated grapes, leeks, or anything pickled so I couldn't comment on that regard either. The two types of pate were very rich and flavorful though and I enjoyed them (personally, my charcuterie board experiences have led me to appreciate a good ol' slice of prosciutto and some aged parmesan). Overall, I could tell this was a very well put together board and I know that those with a finer palette would appreciate it.   The lobster risotto was absolutely delicious! I have been craving seafood since coming to Madison and was not disappointed. For the first time, I sent my dish back, asking for my lobster portion to be cooked just a little while longer, as I preferred that texture that way. They graciously redid the entire dish and cooked the lobster to perfection for me the second time. I was blown away by that part of the service and was blown away by the dish. Though I could see the pool of butter on the risotto and know that this is a large reason it was so decadent and delicious, this was truly one of the best risottos I have had. The vanilla bean made it very unique and aromatic and the risotto itself was very creamy and decadent.  We ordered the brassacre, by the description of the pizza and recommendation of Yelp (and by the sound of the combination. Bacon, olive oil, garlic, and Brussel sprouts are some of the best ingredients in the world). We were not disappointed. The thin crust is my SO's favorite and I am a fan of white pizzas. Everything was crispy and heavenly flavorful. The slight bitterness of the Brussel sprouts complimented the thick chunks of bacon well. We were stuffed and couldn't even finish the entire pizza.  Finally, we had the ginger cake. A huge portion came out for us to share and it smelled great. The cake was slightly warm and topped with mounds of fresh whipped cream. The whipped cream was a perfect complement to the cake and we were glad that the dessert was not overly sweet. It was a sweet and satisfying way to end the evening and we left feeling extremely content.  TLDR: It was a delicious evening. Get the brassacre pizza. I will be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous! What a gorgeous space! I held my breath for the \"first week\"-ness, but everything was fantastic. I could tell there was some calibrating going on, but so far the food is delicious and the staff is warm and professional.   It's definitely not just a \"pizza joint\"--- NOT like Roman Candle or Glass Nickle. More of a sit-down and enjoy dinner spot. The bar is small. The space is classy, with some throwbacks to the gun shop. It's a great alternative to Pig in a Fur Coat -- and it's open super late!   Welcome to the neighborhood, you guys!"}
{"text":"Last minute decision to visit this place late on a Saturday evening.  Arrived after 830, and still had a 30+ minute wait, so we opted to sit at the bar.    Started with the pork confit... Amazing!      Then ordered a pizza... we opted for the first pizza on the menu... tomato sauce, house made sausage, fennel, Anaheim peppers... it was fantastic.   Can't wait to go back and try another pizza."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town.  Salvatore's runs second on my list.  The thin, yet crispy crust is enough to make this pizza the best!  Topping are fresh and push to the edges of the pizza.  Mozzarella is made fresh daily.  I've never had anything disappointing here.  It's pricy, but worth every penny.  There is always a wait, but it's the perfect reason to get a drink next door at Gib's.  Try their play on a Manhattan...the coffee soaked vermouth is amazing and makes the drink!  This is a bar/restaurant combo to bring friends/family to for a night to remember.  Yum!"}
{"text":"We finally made it to Grampa's Pizzeria. Previous attempts have been thwarted with long waits as this is a popular place with excellent food and service! We went early expecting a wait but fortunately were able to be seated right away in a small room with only two tables. We choose the \"Spread the Love\" pizza and it did not disappoint. The kids had basic pies (ones with pepperoni) and they appreciated the thin crust. Excellent beer and wine selection. Loved the infused water and the kids even enjoyed it (surprisingly). The waiter was attentive but not overbearing. Wish I would have saved room for the ginger cake. Will have to visit again soon for that!"}
{"text":"Update: My husband and I were in there the other night and asked the server why it was so slow. He said things have been \"rough.\" After a little research, I saw the news about how management has been treating their employees..... It's a shame. The pizza was amazing, but I can't support a business that doesn't support their employees."}
{"text":"Great place.  Great meal.  Great staff.  Good beer options.  It's a super thin-crust pizza, but made in a \"modern\" oven (vs. wood-fired or \"brick\" style).  I actually like the similar pizzas at Brutta or Porta Alba more, but make no mistake this is great pizza.  And the atmosphere is really cozy too - better than the aforementioned options.  Not quite 5 star, but if I could do 4.5 I would.  There's an adorable bar next-door we'll hit for a cocktail next time we go to Grampa's."}
{"text":"This place is great.  It's like a fancier version of tavern style thin crust from Chicago.  In my experience, that's the pizza that most real Chicagoans eat.  Anyway, what makes it fancier is the really high quality ingredients/toppings.  Really awesome macaroons to boot.  Eat here."}
{"text":"yes yes the wait is long.  i waited about an hour for my table mainly because it's such a small restaurant.  but the pizza is fantastic.  very flavorful, not too heavy and the portions are sized well.  the price can be a little high but for the quality of the pizza, its worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, cozy atmosphere and good prices. I recommend to to the gibs next door while you wait for your table to be ready!"}
{"text":"This place is dope! I came here on Valentine's day and was blown away by the food as well as the service. The night started out a little slow as our table wasn't ready yet so we had to wait about 20 minutes (I can understand since it was one of the busiest days of the year).   After we were seated, we chose the valentines date night menu which started out with a charcuterie board. (A bottle of wine is also included in every meal for date night). This is definitely an acquired taste. I could tell that all the cheese/meats were high quality but they were definitely intense in flavor. If you haven't had cheese/meats like this, I would probably hesitate to recommend this.  Then came the lobster which was amazing. It's a little on the raw side (artistic touch), but was perfectly seasoned and super fresh. The vanilla bean risotto that came with is was also amazing! Even better, my SO didn't quite like the slightly raw lobster so they were kind enough to bring us a new lobster that was well-cooked. Amazing service! I can't rave enough about this fact.  For pizza we had the brassacre which was a decadent hodgepodge of different ingredients. Who'd have known bacon and brussel sprouts would go together well on a pizza? The thin crust was perfectly crispy and amazing! One of the best pizzas I've had in a long time and definitely the best one in Madison by far.  The ginger cake to end was also not too sweet and just perfect. All in all, this was a perfect meal from the service, to the food, to the ambience. We will definitely be coming back for their regular date nights."}
{"text":"This is the pizza place you'd expect to find on Willy Street. Low-lit, hip, California-style small pizzas. It's the kind of place that has a fully local tap beer list that includes their crazy names and origins but no description of the taste.  The house favorites are the Brassacre (bacon chunks and brussel sprouts) and Pinnochio (sausage and fennel) pizzas. They're maybe 13\" in diameter, cut grid-style. If meat pizza is your jam, you'll prefer the Brassacre. It has a variety of flavor that makes the Pinnochio bland in comparison. This said, I preferred the latter, though we're definitely going meatless next time. Reasonably friendly, helpful, attentive staff. Pricing is \"fair\" for Willy Street. Complimentary macarons to end the meal.  The wait wasn't a big deal, but it is apparently a thing. I called ahead to get the wait time and put my name on the list. The waiting area can fit maybe six people comfortably and I imagine it spills into the subzero arctic after that. The door opens to the kitchen straight ahead, and the bar and main dining area to the right. Street parking sucks, especially depending on the time and the plow situation.  Me, I'm not so into the California style. I don't fault Grampa for that, but I'm also not a convert. This said, I like their ethos and my friends were into the pizza, so I recommend it for what it is. Best pizza in town remains Sal's."}
{"text":"This spot is stellar... some of the best pizza in Madison. I'd like to give it four and a half stars, really. There can be a wait on the weekends but it is well worth it. Excited to try the specialty pizzas that we have yet to order."}
{"text":"Excellent.  We had the Brassacre (Which I'm told rhymes with 'massacre' -- I thought it should be Brass Acre because you get an acre of brassica -- but I digress) that was superb, right up there with the best pizzas I have had in town (that would the Pizza Lombardino and the Margherita at Bruta).  The crust isn't great -- I was wondering as we devoured how it would taste cold the next morning, but leftovers didn't happen.  We also had the Pinocchio, with sausage, fennel and chiles, and that was really good too (and also completely eaten)  Quiet enough to eavesdrop on the people surrounding us, which is always interesting when first dates are occurring.  We were there on a Monday night 6ish, not too crowded -- seated right away. Didn't have desert.  The Ginger Cake looked interesting, but alas I had a tub of Lemon Curd at home waiting for me, so I skipped it."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza - we particularly love the Goomba. High quality ingredients all the time. The appetizers are perfect - how to choose between the mozzarella, beet salad, and the fried chicken skins?! This is an affordable restaurant that is both trendy and authentic. Would highly recommend for a romantic dinner date or a meal with your family. Can't go wrong. Plus, you get complementary macaroons as you leave and the water tastes like flowers - it's perfect."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! May be my favorite pizza place in town. Living with celiac disease in Madison is surprisingly easy as so many places offer gluten free options, particularly pizza but no gluten free pizza I have tried so far is as amazing as the g-free pizza at Grampa's.The crust is different than the typical frozen/pre-packaged g free crust that I think most places in Madison use.  We had the Jabroni which has fresh mozz and pesto. We also the Brassacre which had bacon and brussel sprouts, the combo was really unique and super good. The ambiance is really nice and as a smaller restaurant it has an intimate feel. Might not be ideal for larger groups though as there isn't a ton of space. We ordered 2 pizzas with the intention of having leftovers, however we couldn't stop ourselves!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of grampa's. Along with Salvatore's, it's definitely my favorite pizza in Madison, although the two are completely different in pizza style and atmosphere. The toppings are all fantastic-- I appreciate the option of adding Calabrian chiles, Anaheim peppers, and the underground butcher's delectable pepperoni.   Three issues keep this from being five stars: - it's a little on the pricy side  - the pizza is perfect at the edges, but tends to get a little soggy in the middle - there's something vaguely pretentious and unwelcoming about the place. I can't quite put my finger on it-- no one has ever been rude to us, but they never seem particularly happy that we're there."}
{"text":"We couldn't wait to try Grampa's because of all of the good reviews but honestly, we won't go back.  There are so many other great pizza places (Novanta!) in Madison where you don't have to wait forever.  We expected a wait, even on a Tuesday night at 8p...but the wait just isn't worth it.    We were told it would be a 45m wait and we should go next door to Gib's for drinks.  That's all fine and dandy until you get over there and get a call that your table is ready, and oh - you can't bring your drinks back over.  So you slam your $8 craft cocktail that isn't meant to be slammed and rush over before your table disappears.  The space is really great; a little on the dark side, cozy and lots of fresh air blowing through.  The string lights and garden in the back adds to the ambiance.  But you quickly realize why they always have an extensive wait - there aren't a lot of tables and people were hanging out drinking long after their meal was gone.    The service was fantastic, everyone was very friendly and attentive. The pizza was just really not that great.  Ours was very over cooked - left a burnt taste in your mouth.  The toppings were plentiful and tasty but it couldn't mask the burnt crust.  We just didn't think the pizza was worth the trip, the wait and the price.  Disappointing when that's what you're known for.   Again, great service and nice space but the pizza didn't hit the mark."}
{"text":"My husband, 8-year old son and I live in Milwaukee and were headed to Madison for the WIAA basketball tournament. We searched yelp looking for a pre-game pizza stop. We love thin-crust pizza, so when I saw the reviews mention thin-crust, Grandpa's was our choice.  We were seated immediately (5:30 on a Saturday night), and my son sat down, looked around and decided it was nicer than a typical pizza place! This is true, this is a good low-key place to bring kids for the great pizza, but the extensive wine and craft beer menu and decidedly \"grown-up\" appetizer menu would make it a great date place, too. (*Note: There was a childless couple seated in pretty close proximity between my family and another family - mom, dad, and daughter - also 7 or 8 years old. The children were both well-behaved, but if you're on a date to ESCAPE kids altogether, maybe opt for a restaurant that doesn't bill itself as a Pizzeria?)  The three of us decided to split 2 pizzas (all are 12\") which was a perfect amount of food. We ordered a basic pie (cheese) with sausage and a Goomba with pepperoni added. Both pizzas were delicious. The sausage had a little spicy kick, but was still mild enough to please the picky 8-yr-old - who ate a LOT of pizza. The Goomba was delicious. I am deducting a star because the very center pieces of the pizza were a little soggy. The outsides were perfectly thin and crispy.  Service was friendly and attentive. The water was flavored with lemon, orange and cucumber. Delicious to me, but my son preferred tap water. Our waitress happily brought him is very own little carafe of ice water, which he thought was neat.  The end-of-dinner surprise mini-macaroon cookies were a nice touch. We like going new places so I hate to say this is our new \"must-stop\" place when we're in Madison but... it might be our new \"must-stop\" place when we're in Madison."}
{"text":"Back again! Just can't get enough of this place!  The staff and owners are almost as awesome as the food!  The pork confit never disappoints.  Everyone should get down here now!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great pizza!!! Beer - awesome. I had one 12 oz glass (don't remember the name of beer) but that was great. (cost me $9.00 beer only)"}
{"text":"Trendy, warm little pizza place on a cold-ass night?  Yes please. They specialize in authentic style pizzas with an innovative flare, to elevate pizza up a step from your average pizza joint. And they served it elevated too, on a little metal stand so that we could double-tier our pizzas all over the table. My dinner companions were visible above the landscape of lifted pizzas that overtook our table, and we tucked in with vigor.   Their space is a cozy little spot in a re-purposed gun shop. They've kept the gun motif in their decorations as a nod to the previous establishment, in a very tasteful way. (Gun rack wine racks, for example.)  We had a group of 7, and had 6 different pizzas. 5 of them were unmodified specialty pizzas directly off the menu, and 1 modified build-a-pizza of sorts. All were delicious, hot, crispy and well thought out.  My favorite was the 'Goomba,' a mushroom and garlic based mix. But I thoroughly enjoyed the pork confit \"Puerco\" pizza, and the watercress and honey-touched 'Barberini' was a big hit as well.    We also enjoyed an appetizer of the pork confit, which was offered to us as a gift of the house while we waited for our pizzas, since it would take a while to have all 7 pizzas ready. An unexpected and unnecessary windfall, we gobbled it all up gratefully. and ungracefully.   At the end we also ordered a couple of their sticky ginger cakes, which I believe must have had a lemon cream topping, and these were also destroyed in short order. Warm, sticky, moist and creamy, they had a slight crisp to the edges in the very best sort of way. (We ordered these partly because of their open-view kitchen window, which can be viewed from the entryway and from a few of their tables. As we were all restaurant industry people, we were watching the kitchen with undisguised interest. We saw the chef plating the ginger cake, piling the whipped cream on the top artfully, after which he stuck the spoon into his mouth, cleaned it with obvious relish, and threw the spoon into the dish pit. You know when you see that, that the cream must be delicious if it's worth licking off the spoon every time.  For some reason it was difficult for the waitress to do 4 separate checks, but we did our own math with a pen she provided, and lucky for her we were able to figure it out without stiffing her. A less mathematically inclined group might have accidentally stiffed her.  They also offered us some mini orange macaroons at the end, which were the strangest, gooiest little macaroons I have ever had. That's not really a complaint, just an observation that they were unexpected in terms of the texture inside. Besides, who cares! Free candy!  We will be back, Grandpa."}
{"text":"Me and my family showed up for the first time for my fathers birthday and arrived at 4:57pm. We walked inside expecting nice friendly service excited for our meal from all the great reviews. To our surprise we were greeted with a (Were not open yet sorry) keep in mind it is 4:57pm and they open at 5pm. So we asked if it was okay if we stood in the entrance out of everyone's way and wait until they were \"officially open\" to stay out of the cold. The host stumbling over her words rudely said I guess so. Not two seconds after the cook sticks his head out of the kitchen and RUDELY says could you please wait outside until we open or go to the bar next door thanks. Mind you it's 30 degrees outside and it was 4:58pm at this point. This was all because of 2 minutes! They lost a 6 customer tab and we will NOT be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! In town for a training and was recommended this place. It's small and quaint, not great for large groups, but definitely worth trying. Their small plates/salads are great. I highly recommend the beet salad (especially if you like beets and goat cheese), the sous-vide pork and the caprese salad. The pizzas were wonderful! I can't remember the names of the ones we got, but they were both good!   Not only was the food good, but the price was ridiculously affordable! I come from San Francisco where you can't get a decent meal less than $20 so when we came here, I was shocked when I saw how good the quality of food was and how affordable it was!   I would greatly recommend this place to anyone that lives in the area!"}
{"text":"Grampa's had been strongly recommended to me and it lived up to its reputation.  I am not normally a fan of beet salads but was sure impressed with the one we had.  We got a Jabroni pizza that was tasty, though probably not the best pie they sell.  I was very fond of the thin crust and the touch of tang in the pizza sauce, however.  We also got a Sticky Ginger Cake that we shared and it was incredible.  I strongly recommend the beet salad and that cake that is just to die for.  When we were there the Yelp app on my phone showed that a Taco Bell was nearby.  Please, do NOT go to Taco Bell if you're anywhere near Grampa's!  Frankly, I'd never recommend Taco Bell to anyone and was shocked that Yelp would suggest such a place when someone is near other places with phenomenal food."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since it opened.  I went last night with my daughter and grandson (1 year old) and asked for a child seat.  I was told \"we do not have children seats\".  I asked if their policy was to not allow children into the restaurant?  The hostess said it was \"the parent's discretion\".  How do you have a pizza joint named Grandpa's and make it kid unfriendly?  These are the folks who two years ago asked a woman to strop breast feeding her baby. I think it is time to change the name to \"No Grandchildren\" pizza joint.  This is the first time I have ever been in a restaurant that didn't have accommodations for child seating.  NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept but uneven execution.   Bartender was very knowledgeable but wait staff was fairly clueless.  Creative menu but both the sausage and veggie pizzas were far too spicy to be flavorful - in fact they were barely edible.   Terrific deserts but no espresso drinks or quality after dinner liquors to compliment them.   With such a great space and seemingly good intentions, Grandpa's could be so much more."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful experience! Starting with their wonderful water infused with lime, oranges, and cucumber.  So refreshing.  We started out with their Pork Confit (amazing) and Pâté (eh, have had better).  Second course we ordered the beet salad, I must say I'm still dreaming about their perfectly cooked beets and the truffled cherve (goat cheese).  It was the best beet salad I've ever had.  The pizzas we ordered were the Brassacre (the Brussel sprouts and bacon were great), the Goomba (my fav of the 3, superb job on this pizza amazingness), and the Barberini (would have been my favorite, but the chilis didn't fit with the ricotta and honey, I will order it without next time).  My waitress was, eh, ok I guess.  She seemed eager to send us on our way, and was a bit messy.  The over all ambience was super quaint and romantic, love the candlelight!  Great place for a date night.  I loved it!  The missing star was for the waitress and the unnecessary too hot chilis.  Keep up the good work other wise grampas!"}
{"text":"I've noticed that pizza in Madison is honestly not that good in my opinion...but Grampa's is definitely one of the best, if not the best!    It's a little bit of a nicer place, which I did not expect! Definitely more of a sit down place, but I saw a few people grab pizza for takeout. Good place for a small group, but given that it's a very small place, I wouldn't go with more than a group of 5.   My friends and I had been trying to go to this place for a while - since it's so small, the wait gets incredibly long around peak dinner times. Try going at 5-5:30 if you want to go on weekends - shouldn't have to wait then!  So onto the pizza - it's thin crust and a little pricier than other pizza places. My friends and I got two appetizers and 3 pizzas for a group of 4, and it was a perfect amount. The Duck Confit appetizer was fairly impressive, and a standout pizza was the Brassacre.  I personally think Grampa's was better than Salvatore's Tomato Pies, which is often regarded as the best pizza place in Madison. If you want a fancier pizza, I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Whether dining in or doing takeout, there's never been a misstep by Grampa's Pizzeria. The light, crisp, airy crust has pretty much spoiled me for most other pizzas. The toppings are fresh and the balance of flavors is perfection. My favorite is the Brassacre, with the Finocchio coming in a close second. Love the cozy, candlelit vintage interior; the antique gilt-framed mirrors behind the bar really open up the space. The service is relaxed, knowledgeable and friendly. We only waited about fifteen minutes for a table during their busiest time. Extensive wine and craft beer list, too, including Mobcraft on tap. The finishing touch is the little amuse bouche of macarons at the end of the meal, delicious and just right for people like me who just need a little something sweet."}
{"text":"Ok, wow. First, I am confused that I have never written a review for Grampa's - I can't begin to figure out how many times I've eaten here! It's definitely in my top 5 of Madison restaurants. The pizza is incredible, the cocktails are delightful, and they have really tasty gluten free pizza crust.   BUT - now they've gone and upped the ante by offering BRUNCH. Madison, I love you, but your brunch game is \"off point\". (Is that a thing? It should be). Just about every weekend that I'm in town, we have an endless discussion called \"where can we get breakfast?\". We first went to brunch at Grampa's for Mother's Day - and not only was there NO WAIT, the food was amazingly amazing. I had the butcher's breakfast, which had perfectly cooked beef tenderloin, among many other lovely things. I had a cocktail that was wine and coffee together, that I didn't love but my mom really liked, so I'll still say it was great, just not to my taste. It was a pretty good brunch.  We came back this past Sunday, and WOW. As good as it was six weeks ago, they are hitting their stride now. My mom had the eggs benedict with pork confit, and could not stop talking about how it was made of \"all the best parts of the pork roast\". I had a bunch of sides as a meal. The bacon, Nueske's, was thick cut and incredible, melt in your mouth fantastic. The best bacon I have ever eaten, ever - and it's an incredibly generous portion, enough to share. I also had the pommes Anna, which is about 30,000 paper thin potato layers, slathered in butter and topped with parmesan cheese. Incredible. Somehow they take everything that is excellent about potatoes, butter, and cheese and amplify it.  I love this place, and it never fails to please, hence the 5 stars. However, in the spirit of constructive feedback, here are a few missteps from this weekend -   1) Our waitress was a little bit difficult to track down - we had to ask the hostess for water, and to go find the server when we needed a new drink order.  2) The Bloody Mary was too spicy to drink, and we heard another table say the same thing - my mom said it tasted like straight sriracha (and we love spicy).  3) Though there were corn tortillas on the menu, I was told that the chilaquiles, which come with flour tortillas, could not be subbed for corn because they were \"all premade already\". Grampa's doesn't strike me as a \"premade\" sort of spot, so this confused me, hence the meal of sides. It was no big deal, but sort of surprising as they are always super accommodating of all the things.  We love you! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza I have ever enjoyed. Absolutely great service and a cozy, lovely interior (feels like home). Really, really recommend."}
{"text":"Lovely little pizzeria. While weekends are busy, what was supposed to be an hour wait turned into an easy twenty, just enough time for a drink down the street. It's incredibly convenient to have them call you when the tables are ready, as well. The beer and wine lists are stellar, and the food is both fresh and exquisite. Our wait staff was wonderful, and the ambiance perfect for a semi-casual but still lovely date night. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Grampa's Pizza is probably my favorite restaurant in Madison. Not only are their pizzas delicious and cooked to perfection, but so are their salads and small plates!   You may have to wait a bit for a table but it is definitely worth it. If you want to have the most appetizing salad of your life, order the panzanella salad as it is the best salad I have honestly ever had. It is beautifully seasoned and the flavors are all there. I also really love the Jabroni plus Calabrian chiles. The mix between the pesto and tomato sauce is just perfect and adding the chiles adds a little kick. If you have not been to Grampa's Pizza yet, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Grampa, you've won me over.  While we had a tough go of it on my first visit, on my three subsequent interactions, you have knocked it out of the park.  I experienced the Brassacre pizza twice during the 2014 March Madness #PizzaBracket extravaganza and this pizza met, nay, exceeded my lofty expectations.  Grampa's definitely has addressed the issues with the crust that vexed me during my initial visit.  The pizza crust on the Brassacre was truly special, with the proper proportions of bite and chew and SERIOUS flavor.   The toppings were equally impressive; the caramelized exterior on the brussels sprouts gave the pizza a hint of sweetness to balance the smoky, slightly salted righteousness that came with the perfectly rendered Nueske's bacon.  One bite and I knew I was in the presence of pizza perfection.  The Goomba and Jabroni pizzas are also culinary wonders.  Despite the service hiccups experienced during my first visit, the quality of the pizzas certainly warrants a five star rating."}
{"text":"Had the brassacre (Brussels sprouts, bacon, cheese, Olive oil), kale salad, and the spicy ginger cake. Awesome."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  It was 5 of us for dinner last night and all of us were simply wowed!  All 3 pizzas we tried were absolutely delicious!  Being a native Chicagoan I love my deep dish pizza but the pizzas at Grampas, though thin crust, were absolutely mind-boggling good.  The pizzas are not overstated and neither is the restaurant; the menu is not cluttered.  Emphasis is definitely placed on good, simplistic, rustic feel pizza.  They offer toppings you aren't going to find everywhere, like honey and calabrian chiles.    For that couple looking for a romantic spot to dine, I would not say Grampas fills that order, but I do think it has its own charm.  A great place to have dinner with friends and adult family members (this place is not what I would call kid-friendly, and as a child-free adult, I like that!).  And after your meal, request a french press or a glass of wine.  They do have several beers on tap as well.  Hats off to whoever thought of the idea of putting cucumbers in water.  Keep it up!  I will be back!  :D"}
{"text":"Atmosphere in Grandpa's is awesome, most people have to wait, so go next door to their old Victorian \"house\" converted into a bar and have a delicious cocktail.  Once you finally sit down to dinner at Grandpa's, it's a warm, rustic, hippy atmosphere.  The pizza is amazing, every kind.  The pork confit - like the other reviews say, is delicious, the giardiniera really compliments the flavors.  We ordered the calamari which is pretty bland and tasteless, the only part of calamari you are really getting is the texture.  Besides that, definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Okay, I decided not to take off stars for coming here three other times on a Friday night (varying times of the evening) and having AT LEAST an hour wait. We weren't into waiting that long, especially when so many other great restaurants are in the area.  This time, it was only 30 minutes (so we were told), and we weren't starving. So we put in our names and headed next door to Gib's for a few cocktails. After 40 minutes, we checked back at the Grampa's hostess station, and nothing was yet available. The small bar inside was also full, so the hostess suggested we stand by the wall and get a beer. After another 20 minutes, our table was ready. The hostess comped our beers, which is the only reason this is keeping a 5 star rating. Classy move.   The rest of the service was great, as was the Finnochio pizza. We substituted calabrians for the anaheim's and it was a good move. Pizza was perfectly thin and cooked well. No burned edges that are common with pizza that thin, and the squares in the very center were still reasonably crisp. A perfect size for two hungry people.   Looking forward to eating there again when I'm up for a wait. :-)  We are lucky to have so many great pizza joints in Madison."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for dinner, and we loved the space immediately. They've done a great job aesthetically. We were seated in the back, by a nice row of windows, where I fear that aesthetics may have trumped function, given that the noise from the few tables around us sounded like people were speaking loudly right into our ears. That wasn't a big deal, but something to note if you are more sensitive to noise.  We were excited by the menu options, ordering a market salad, a homemade mozzarella plate (sprinkled with vanilla fleur de sel), and a pizza with ricotta, watercress, honey, and chilies. Everything sounded interesting, and our expectations were high for quality.  The market salad was *amazing*. It was just the right balance of delicate leafy greens and crisp fresh vegetables, with beautiful shavings of unexpected root vegetables. The dressing fit the salad perfectly in terms of weight and flavor.   The mozzarella, sadly, was a bit disappointing. It wasn't bad, but the description of *homemade* fresh mozzarella with fleur de sel, along with the visual cues of an upscale, foodie-focused restaurant set our expectations quite high. The flavor was good, but the texture was far too firm, which was surprising for freshly made mozzarella. Again, it was pretty good, it just fell short of our expectations.  The pizza was good, and I like that it is a very different style than most pizza places in Madison. However, it fell into the same trap as the mozzarella plate: it sounded so interesting and delicious that our expectations were set too high. The crust was a bit too chewy (perhaps over-kneaded?) and a bit bland in flavor. The toppings just didn't quite mesh, like they hadn't refined the flavor profile yet. The sauce didn't match the rest of the items, and the chilies overwhelmed the other flavors (and I love spicy food).  The prices seemed fair to me. We shared the three plates I've described, plus two drinks, and the bill came to $32. It felt like a nice nights out, and we were plenty full.  I know this review is coming off as a bit negative. We truly thought it was pretty good, but that's the thing: it was pretty good -- not as amazing as the ambiance and menu descriptions made them sound. I will definitely give them another chance, because I think there's potential there if they can get some of these kinks worked out."}
{"text":"There's good pizza and then there's great pizza. Grampa's crushes great and goes to straight phenomenal! Not only is the place super chill, super comfortable but the food and service are second to none.  Came here on a friend's suggestion and was floored. He said this was the second best pizza in Madison. This is a debatable fact because number one is oh so good too but two totally different styles of the good stuff. Either way I was in pizza heaven!   We ordered two apps and three pies. The first app blew my mind. We had the dumplings which were in this rich broth with a nice smear of foie gras. The dumplings were a perfect way to start the meal. Four perfectly cooked dumplings that were tender juicy and full of flavor. I started to realize then and there Grampa's was not afraid to build flavor profiles wish the right spices and ingredients.   Next up pizza 1, 2 and 3. The first was this week/months special. The sweet corn pizza. This was hands down my favorite despite its lack of protein. I was amazed and when I read it on the menu I knew we had to try it just because. No wrongs here only right!   Pizza two and three were the staples of the house which would be the Pinocchio which was nice and spicy, literally some heat! The fennel sausage and chilies made it nom-nom good! Also had a milder but still packed with flavor and big chunks of bacon, Brassacare. This was another solid edition to our stellar line up of pies.   Grampa's is a truly killer thin crust. It is crisp and holds up well for the selection of house favorites we had. I would come back again in a heartbeat and Madison overall always gets some love for the amazing food scene they supply. Grampa's thanks for a great evening and a great meal! We left stuffed!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open, hoping that Madison will get a great pizza place just a few blocks from my house. Finally, the grand opening on July 10th, I popped in after Concerts on the Square to try it out.  Grampa's did not disappoint! The place was packed, a great sign. We waited about 15 minutes for a table, grabbed a drink from the bar in the meantime. The entry area and bar area are pretty small...not much waiting room. They offer about 6-8 beers on tap, bottled beers, and a bunch of wines, reasonably priced. The kitchen is right near the front door and you can see the chefs prepping food while you wait. We saw some things come out of the window that looked delicious!  Once seated, we ordered the pork confit, market salad, and the Finocchio pizza. The pork confit was AMAZING, served with grilled bread, mustard, and giardiniera (pepper mix). We expected the pork to be fatty, but it was super lean, tender and moist, delicious with a crispy crust. The combo with the mustard and peppers was awesome! My favorite dish of the night. The salad was a great mix of greens, olives, an edible flower, sprouted lentil, and some other delicious goodness, perfectly dressed with a light vinaigrette. Then the pizza came. The Finocchi is topped with house-made sausage, fennel, and anaheim chilis. The pizza was a little burnt around the edges, but the crust was thin with a nice crunch/firmness. The sausage had a good flavor. The pizza was the perfect size for two.   Overall, Grampa's had a great grand opening and I can't wait to return to try some of their other dishes! The service was good and the place has a cool vibe."}
{"text":"Quaint, charming little spot on Willie St. Very friendly waitstaff. The pizza is good if you're interested in non-traditional kinds of pizzas. I love that they use locally sourced products. The ground cherries in my salad won me over."}
{"text":"First time visiting Grampa's Pizzeria and definitely not my last. Overall scenery gives a relaxing but cool vibe, the brick wall behind the bar with the multitude of mirrors is a great touch. We started with the Mozzarella appetizer, the portion was the perfect amount before a meal and we could not get enough of the vanilla salt on top of the cheese. Not too long after our Barberini pizza came out. The honey gave the pizza a sweet taste instead of purely spicy from the peppers. It was the perfect amount of food for two people. Afterwards our server Matt brought complimentary macaroons in a bag. I highly suggest visiting this place, great pizza, atmosphere and employees."}
{"text":"I came here with my expectations through the roof because of these raving yelp reviews and hearing it from people I know that live in the area.. I was a bit underwhelmed. The reason why it took me so long to try Grampa's is because the wait is always over an hour and we're always way too hungry to wait that long. Surprisingly, we went around 7PM last Friday and got seated immediately for two at the bar. The bartender was extremely attentive and quick to help us. We ordered the cheese board to start (along with some drinks). They had a variety of different cheeses along with candied pistachios (yum), honey, and bread. It was pretty satisfying and nice to have with a glass of wine while waiting for our pizza.   We ordered the \"Jabroni\" pizza which is vegetarian. Maybe it's because I grew up in the Chicagoland area or visit NYC a lot... but the pizza was just average to me. The edges are always super crispy and kind of burnt, which I was not a fan of. I felt like every time I had an edge piece, I had that burnt taste in my mouth. One pizza was enough for the two of us, we ended up taking a decent amount of it home (most likely because we had the appetizer with it). It's a great atmosphere with a really nice staff--but because the pizza is the main attraction, I have to give it the average rating of 3 stars."}
{"text":"First time to Grandpa's and it was a stellar experience!  The service was attentive, the atmosphere relaxed and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is impressive.  I split a pizza (Finnocchio) with my friend so I could try the soup (Soupe au Pistau).  Everything  was so good.  It is worth a trip out to explore this place.    The building is interesting.  I don't know if I would come here if it was really busy.  Lucky the night I went is was quiet."}
{"text":"Seriously great pizza. Excellent service. Amazing appetizers (The pork could be a top notch meal on it's own). Great atmosphere.   Eat here often.    End Transmission."}
{"text":"Perfect Monday night spot to grab a drink, order some apps, and delicious thin artisanal pizza."}
{"text":"I have been here a bunch of times. This is my default place of pizza. You know times when your group gets tired of guessing where to go, I don't have that now. I like the flavors and pizza options that they offer. It is also good for cheese (I love mozzarella here). Some wines and beer choices are also good."}
{"text":"Your problem: You want awesome, inexpensive pizza, some good booze, and a nice, quiet, pleasant ambience.  Solution: Grampa's Pizzeria."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Food was great and service as just as good.  Place is little small, so seating is troublesome.  Pizzas are creative, favorable, and fresh tasting.  Being small, table are very close and making the atmosphere a little loud.  It is a little pricy, but it is down town madison."}
{"text":"Delicious thin crust pizza with very good small plate appetizers. Be prepared for a long wait during dinner hours, but it's so worth it to dine in at this very cozy place. The staff are so nice! They will give you a brief introduction of each small plate, and also recommend you a few of their favorites. We tried the calamari, which was very special. It had meat within, and roasted with tomato sauce. I also like the pork confit, which came with bread, pickled jalapeños and a special mustard."}
{"text":"Eww, not for me, I would have to say that if you like thin crust pizza that the Greenbush Bar is the way to go.  Also the best bourbon selection in town"}
{"text":"Long wait times the first time, so had to return another day.  Good staff and service, decent presentation on the pizza trays. For the price, I still prefer Pizza Brutta over this place. It feels more like \"very very very good flatbread\" instead of pizza.  Great decor and staff though. If I wasn't so food-obsessed I'd rate it higher."}
{"text":"Ate here after l'fete de Marquette. Had pizza and crab appetizer.  Everything was fantastic.  Great wine list.  Do not miss this restaurant when in Madison."}
{"text":"Got a recommendation for Grampa's from a local while on the plane to Madison. Decided to stop in for dinner and was not let down. The intimate dining room is cozy, but not too small. There are old pictures of the chef's family mixed into combination of wood and subway tile.   Our waiter was friendly and answered any questions we had. I started with beer called Little Sister from Door County Brewing in Baileys Harbor, WI. It was a Belgian Style Witbier with spices and orange peel. I am always a fan of trying something local!   Then for two of us, we decided to order a small plate and then share pizza. I must say, I was so impressed by all of the fresh ingredients. Many of which tasted like they were pulled from the garden on the same day. We started out with the mozzarella, which is made fresh daily. Topped with balsamic and tomatoes...need I say more? For the pizza we decided to go with the Goomba. I personally don't like mushrooms so we ordered half and half. The crispy crust and garlic cream made the pizza for me.   As we were preparing to settle the bill, they brought the check along with a brown paper bag which, to our surprise, had cookies in it. I loved the unique touch rather than a typical mint. If you are looking for a cozy, pizza place head to Grampa's!"}
{"text":"When I first heard the name of this place, I imagined a squeaking fan, old linoleum floors, sticky vinyl chairs, with maybe a dusty bear head in the corner. But Grampa pulled one on me! He was hip, fresh, and slightly a romancer! If you're craving pizza, but you're so over plain pepperoni, or if you don't want to feel greasy after a slice with the energy of a tube sock, then this is the the pizza place for you! It's pretty popular, so either get there early or plan to wait. The parking isn't fantastic, but there is always street parking available in that area. Also, if you're super in to fancy bathrooms...go to a hotel - this one is decent, but not Wowzers!"}
{"text":"A great italian pizzeria. The waitpersons are very nice, aned the pizza are thin with great taste! I'll be back as soon as I'll come back in Madison."}
{"text":"best pizza i've had so far in madison. they also have delicious appetizers that change-we had a cheese plate-sometimes w/ fancy ingredients that scare me a little. a great offering of tasty, well-made pizza for even the simplest of palates, like mine, or the froo froo epicurians of the east side."}
{"text":"We went here without looking at any reviews or info and I was pleasantly surprised. It was much more upscale than I expected, so dinner was a little pricier than we anticipated. The place is gorgeous inside and the pizzas were delicious. There were 5 of us, and our competent waiter did tell us pizzas usually serve 2, but 3 of us ordered our own and the other 2 shared, so we sampled 4 pies. They were all delicious. The one I ordered had Brussel sprouts and bacon, really thick chunks of bacon that melted in your mouth. I ate too many slices, that's for sure! Our waiter checked on us frequently without being intrusive, and kept our drinks replenished and water filled. Also, at the end of the meal he brought us a bag of macaroons that they make in-house. We will definitely go back to try other items."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant due to the good reviews and the appeal of their homegrown ingredients. I made a special stop here during my short trip to Madison and wish I went somewhere else instead of wasting one of my 2 dinner opportunities. Not only was the wait for my pizza very excessive (I didn't keep track but it certainly felt like 45+ minutes), but when it finally came, I was very disappointed. I ordered the cheese with sausage and it was incredibly bland. Maybe I am spoiled by the pizza in New York, but I would have preferred my favorite papa johns pizza over waiting an hour for this low quality product."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've ever had - including pizza in NYC and Chicago. I got the Barberini pizza, and it was amazing! All of the ingredients were extremely fresh. I also strongly recommend the ginger cake. This place is wonderful - if you're in Madison, go here!"}
{"text":"We had the Finnochio, and the Brassacre.  Both of them were just OK. Nothing special.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Great place. First time we were here for a private event and got to taste a bunch of stuff, loved it and made a point to try and get back. We tried and tried and tried but couldn't get in ... until the other night!  What impressed the S.U. and I the first time was meeting Gill and Marissa, who run a fantastic operation, and the unique small plates. Try them! The pizzas are really good but, IMHO the small plates are where Gill shines so, this time we went all small plates and salads.   We ordered a handful and a glass of Cava to start. Our server handled the delivery sequence to match our wine choices so we sat back and let it come. They had a fresh grilled ramps dish with fried anchovies, lemony vinaigrette topped with a fried egg. Great start!  Next, meat-filled dumplings (4) topped with foie gras in a tasty broth followed by the beet salad. Not a bad bite yet.  Take a breath, shift to the house red, (Hedges CMS, a hometown favorite) and bring on the Pork Confit and Stuffed Calamari. This is the \"one bite, one sip\" stage of the dinner. Slow down, savor, enjoy. Grampa's version of Pork Confit is served with ground mustard and giardiniera ...dee-lish. The spicy sausage ('nduja) stuffed calamari was a forceful match to the Confit.   Talent and skill in the kitchen, great service on the floor. A wonderful dinner out!"}
