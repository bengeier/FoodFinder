{"text":"Consistently good pizza and chicken.  Wheat crust is really good, and ordering a thin wheat bianca will give you almost a cracker crust that isn't soggy at all.  Their Italian dressing is the best we've ever had, and we always stock it to have in the house.  It kind of weirds me out that a pizza place doesn't deliver, but since we (and everyone else) keep going back means they know more than I do.  If you or someone you know is gluten-free, this is a good place to keep on the list though if you're very sensitive, there is a possibility of inadvertent cross contamination as they have a lot of wheat flour there."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I LOVE the food. The pizza is outstanding, I personally love the Thai Pie, the chicken is phenomenal and the subs are just as good. I even like everyone there, the staff is incredibly nice and Dennis always greets everyone he sees if he's working.  That being said, the reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is the service. The staff is nice and polite but the last 4 or 5 times I've gone there I've has to wait twice as long for my food as given over the phone. I seem to notice this if I order jojo's, pizza is almost always ready on time. But by the time my jojo's are ready, everything else has sat there, done for many minutes. I also usually order on a busy day, so there's that."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices! This was the first place I ate moving to Stow. I had the mixed fried chicken then, but since I've had the Alfredo, Margarita, and Meat pizzas and they were all delicious. Even sampled the Thai one and though it's strange, it's delicious."}
{"text":"I go here at least twice a week! My BF is a Celiac and is in love with their gluten-free pizza. Even though I can eat gluten, I prefer their gluten-free! They have gluten-free chicken and jojos two days a week and the jojos are out of this world fantastic. Also try the salads! They home-make several dressings and I love their Greek Salad. You can buy the dressings in pint containers that are priced low. I love to marinate chicken in their Italian dressing!"}
{"text":"Good Gluten Free menu compared to just about anywhere else! Pizza is great, & Gluten free pasta is the best Ive had."}
{"text":"This place is pretty pricey. It gets three stars b/c after we paid, an employee advised us to order the toppings separately vs as the \"special\" because it would be cheaper. Wait, what? -_- Not cool, bro.   But the pizza was bonkers! So good! Maybe they'll make it right and I'll update my review. Til then, check your prices - its WORTH it!"}
{"text":"Used to be our favorite pizza shop, hands down. Recently service has gone down hill and it's a pain that they don't deliver. Beware if you are ordering late night, the free piece of cheese that they gave out, made me sick (not sure how long it had been sitting out). Unfortunately what used to be our favorite now makes my stomach churn even thinking about it."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place a little bit more than me. Pizza is not greasy at all. You will pay extra for extra cheese but they make it worth it. I got my half with just onion one time, holy crap. There was way tooooo much and it's diced. I also hated their cole slaw. That being said, the service is awesome. I've had nice casual conversation on not so busy days. They always have that sampler slice, which is unique. Chicken and pasta is good. We are hooked."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and antipasto salad and it was the best I've had in the Akron area!!!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza - Great Price !  I enjoy the monthly specialty pizzas.  The pizzas here are always piping hot, made with fresh ingredients.  Love the taster slice you get when you pick up your order.  Staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Glutenfree pizza and subs. Yessssssss We thought it was sit down but no.  Only takeout.   That's okay.  Will eat in the car.  Subs were small but very yummy.  Pizza was 8 out of 10.    We will definitely be back to Altieri's pizza in Stow Ohio"}
{"text":"Altieris' offers a slew of gluten free options. The gluten free pizza is awesome. They have gluten free pizza and pasta daily with other options specific days of the week. I have heard their gluten pizza is excellent."}
{"text":"I had such high high hopes after reading other reviews..what a let down. Had the Greek pizza, very bland and undercooked. Also tried the award winning wings...very undercooked, probably shouldn't have eaten them, but tried them anyways. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"They are not out business Good quality pizza  No delivery  And take out no where to dine Worth the money  Would go here again"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I don't want to review because I don't want a million more people to find out about it.  Kent/Stow locals flock to this place.  It is always packed and you can't even eat in the restaurant!  It's just a huge line of people waiting for their pizza so they can take it home and devour it.  With a lack of good pizza in Kent, I was so excited to find this place, I could hardly wait the 25 minutes to go pick up more order.  Altieri's is family-owned, which I love.  I'd rather support a local business than a chain any day.  Everyone who works here is super friendly and dedicated to the quality of their food. When I called to place my order, I was chit-chatting with the man on the other end of the line for a good five minutes.  Once he found out I was a new customer, he wanted to know all about how I heard of them, what made me decide to give them a try, etc.  And he promised that as a new customer, I'd get some free goodies.  Score!  They have many, many offerings on their menu.  They have 14 specialty pizzas plus a pizza of the month.  And of course, you can make your own pizza.  They also have fried chicken, pasta, and subs.  As an added bonus, they offer both gluten free pizzas and pastas.  Now that's a rarity.  Their small pizzas are enough for one person, so the boyfriend and I each ordered our own.  I chose the bianca (Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Garlic, Thyme, Fontinella and Provolone Cheese) and the BF chose the Meatsa (Tomato Sauce, Pepperoni, Sausage, Bacon, Beef Steak, Meatball, and Provolone Cheese).  We were quoted a 25-minute wait time, and I impatiently watched the minutes tick by before I could leave my apartment.  When I arrived at Altieri's, it wasn't what I expected.  I didn't realize it was carry-out only, so obviously the place was very, very tiny.  It was also, very, very packed.  There must have been 8 other groups waiting for their orders while I was.  My order was ready to go when I got there (yay for accurate time-estimates!) and the staff took the care to open each pizza box to show me that the right pizza awaited me inside.  They also took extra time to chat with me as a new customers and explain some of the specials and perks that they offer.  As for those freebies?  I got a pen and a magnet.  Woo-hoo!    My favorite part of Altieri's might be the snacks tehy give out.  They are very well-aware of how delicious their pizza smells.  They know how torturous it is to drive home with your car smelling like delicious food...your stomach rumbling....impatiently waiting to devour the carby goodness inside the box.  To make the whole experience easier for you, they give you (and everyone with you) a free piece of pizza for the road.  We're not talking a tiny bite of pizza.  Oh no.  We're talking a real piece of pizza.  Usually the sampel pizza is their \"pizza of the month\" but they change it up sometimes.  There's a calendar on the website to let you know what freebie you'll have that day.  The sample on the day I went was their Buffalo Chicken Pizza  (Pizza Sauce topped with Seasoned Chicken tossed with Buffalo Hot Sauce, Celery, Provolone Cheese and topped with Ranch Dressing).  Holy delicious, batman.  I'm not normally a big fan of buffalo chicken pizza, but wow.  This pizza should be a staple on their regular menu, not just an offering in the month of October!  When I finally got our pizzas home, I was too hungry to both grabbing a plate.  Like heathens, the BF and I ate our pizzas directly from the boxes.  My bianca pizza was wonderfully seasoned and the Provolone cheese is absolutely perfect on a pizza.  The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the crust.  However, this could be because the pizza cooled significantly en route home, and cold pizza has a much different texture than hot pizza.  The BF ooh-ed and aah-ed over he pile of meat pizza so much that I had to try a bite even though I don't generally like meat pizzas.  It was really freaking good.  It was obvious that the meat was all fresh and not processed garbage.  And again the Provolone cheese was perfect.  Altieri's will definitely be my go-to pizza place in the area from now on!"}
{"text":"Place was busy when we arrived.  Staff was friendly.  As others have mentioned, they have a pizza of the month.  We were offered each a free slice.  Pizza seemed a little \"bready\" for my taste but the toppings were good."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a whim since it's close to home.  The usual chains were wearing us thin.  Huge variety on the pizza menu, haven't tried anything else.  Quick at dinner time.  Friendly when you arrive to pickup.  They have a different take, using provolone cheese instead of mozzarella. I will be a regular, glad to be rid of the chains!"}
{"text":"We order from Altieri's fairly frequently. I called to order their Saturday special, two 12\" one topping pizzas and a two liter of pop (which I would not have taken). I ordered one cheese pizza and one with pepperoni. The employee on the phone would not give me pricing on the special but instead wanted to charge me full price for the pizza's because I was not ordering two toppings. What should have cost me $17.75, they wanted to charge me $21.50, only because I didn't want the extra topping. I ended up ordering from a different local pizza shop. This is no way to treat customers. Although the pizza is good, it's is definitely not good enough to warrant trying to overcharge customers who, in my mind, are saving them money by not putting an extra topping on a two topping pizza. Altieri's has lost a rather loyal customer today. There are so many pizza shops popping up around the area. I will venture out and try something new."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, it doesn't make our stomachs upset like Pizza Hut does, not as greasy, and still delicious."}
{"text":"Kids had back to back sports events on a cold rainy Saturday morning. Fortunately, the second game was in Munroe Falls allowing for an order from Altieri's Pizza! This gets five stars for two reasons: 1. The gluten free option for pizza, chicken, and jo jos.   2. For their creativity. I like the Thai Pie and my wife loves the Ranch Pizza. The Thai Pie has chicken, sliced meatballs, red onions, provolone, and spicy peanut sauce. This pizza is a little spicy, but does not cause you to break out in a sweat. The Ranch pizza has ranch dressing, bacon, red onion, mushrooms, tomatoes, and provolone cheese. I also always purchase a container of the house Italian dressing.  This place is take out only."}
{"text":"***GLUTEN FREE EATERS DELIGHT*** Sweet mother of monkey milk. This place is absolutely part of the bomb dot com group. I got an email from Yelp suggesting this little beauty and on a whim, I decided I would swing by and see what was cookin'.....and I am sure glad I did.  This tiny little hole in the wall pizza shop is in a well taken care of strip mall in Stow. Take out only and a single bench to sit and wait....now that is what I am talkin' about. No frills, no apologies. This usually means the place is worth it's weight in gold.....and in this case, it is worth its weight in cheese. This mom and pop pizza parlor is where it is at lemme tell ya. And the people are awesome too!  Here is a breakdown of what I tried....and what I thought.  1) Gluten Free BBQ Chicken Pizza: The gluten free crust is OFF THE CHAIN. I have NEVER had a gluten free crust so realistic, that if I closed my eyes, I would think I was eating the real thing. No joke people....this stuff is the real deal. A perfect blend of crisp, chew and fluff. Not too thick and not too thin. The flavor was on point and had me begging for more. The BBQ sauce had a nice tangy and sweet flavor, there was plenty of ooey, gooey cheese and the chicken was tender and flavorful. This pizza was truly the highlight of my year. It made me feel like I was eating gluten filled goodness. Extraordinary!  2) Gluten Free Brownie: This thick, chewy and chocolatey brownie was HUGE. About 4 inches squared and 1 inch high, it looked like something out of a bake shop. Nice huge chunks of chocolate nestled inside gave you a big burst of flavor. Gimme some milk and gimme a nap. I want a whole pan of these babies!  3) Gluten Free Peanut Butter Cookie: BY FAR MY FAVORITE DESSERT! To be fair, I am a peanut butter whore of sorts. I LOVE me some peanut butter. This cookie took me back to my nonna's kitchen at Christmas time. Soft in the center and crispy on the outside. God yes....I want more.   4) Gluten Free Double Chocolate Cookie: Very similar to the brownie in flavor and the peanut butter cookie in texture. A formidable dessert....but not different enough for me to give it rave reviews. If the brownie is too much for you, then this would be a great second bet!  5) Gluten Free M&M Cookie: This one was on the top of my list to want to try......BUT it was crispy and hard. Not my kinda cookie. If you like a nice crisp cookie....then you will love it. Great flavor!  6) Gluten Free Cannoli: Ok.....so I am disappointed with this one. I have had LOTS of real deal cannoli's in my day. Let me be clear, the shell on this thing was amazing. Crispy and perfect. BUT the filling is WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY too sweet. Like sickeningly sweet. Every cannoli I have had an loved (including the ones my nonna made) were just sweet enough to make it yummy. I would LOVE this if they would tone down on the sweetness.  I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone who is GF. I cannot attest to the normal gluten filled loveliness they sell....but it if it is ANYTHING like the GF stuff, it is a home run."}
{"text":"A++++ Will do business with again!!  Good pizza. It's different. I give it 5 stars because I ordered 20 minutes before closing and the pizza unexpectedly turned out great.   A little too much cheese for me though. Real cheese is different than vegan cheese.   I really like the oregano or basil undertone. It really gives depth to the overall flavor.   I wish the employees were a little more friendly. It's always weird when everyone stares at you but doesn't say hi or what's up?   I have high standards for food and a lot of dietary restrictions. This average pizza place for stow deserves 5 stars though. They do well at being average and I pride them for that."}
{"text":"This is a thicker crust pizza. The crust is rather dry and white breadish. Sausage and onions we ordered were rather unremarkable, as is the sauce, which is slightly sweet. Cheese is typical of Akron area pizza shops.   I am not a big fan of the locally owned shops in the Akron area and this is pretty far down the list of favorite locals."}
{"text":"My wife and I avoid eating grain and dislike soy. As a result we have gone without pizza for some time. Not so anymore!  Their No crust pizza is the bomb! All the best parts of the pizza, without the crust - and so much cheese!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried their pizza, but their fried chicken with jojo is always amazing. The fried chicken is  made after ordering, so remember to order 20 to 30 mins earlier."}
{"text":"Great pizza. High quality ingredients and friendly customer service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went here with high expectations going of yelp reviews, but I was highly disappointed. My guess would be most folks who've raved about this pizza have not tasted pizza outside the Akron area.  The deluxe was okay but the chicken Alfredo was inedible. Pizza is my favorite food and it's hard to ruin it for me but I met my match this time."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!  They have the best deep dish pizza's!  The meatsa pie, is amazing!  They only come in an 8 slice pizza,  but believe me, that's all ya need.  It's expensive for a deep dish!  But so worth it!  They don't deliver!  But there pizza is so great I have no problem ordering an picking up!  The owner is very friendly, and always has free pizza tastes for you, when you as a paying customer, come in to pick up your pizza!  I feel they are doing great for business, but not delivering I would be surprised if they fall off here shortly!  But that's why I Yelp! Get over there when you can, it won't disappoint!  I swear!  Huge pizza selection too, they have a Mediterranean pizza, my wife loves, I have to order it every time!  Has Mediterranean olives, feta, lamb meat, it's awesome!  So many khool pizzas."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about Altieri's is their specialty pizzas. The pizza in general is fine, but they do a great job of thinking outside the box. Every time you pickup a meal, they offer you a free slice of one of their special pizzas, which is a nice touch. They are also known for their gluten-free pies.   The February \"Pizza of the Month\" is the Potato Pizza, and it is superb. It has potatoes, sour cream, onion and bacon. It's delicious, and unlike any pizza I've ever had. It has the \"It factor\". If March comes around and you didn't get a potato pizza from Altieri's, well, you officially failed February.   The chicken Alfredo specialty pizza is also one of my favorites.   I love their Thursday deal. Buy a sub, and get free jo-jos, drink and cole slaw.   It can get super busy, especially on Friday nights. The line can be out the door, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Months ago I was diagnosed as gluten intolerance. As the months have gone on my relationship with eating out has become something of a love-hate relationship. And just when I finally discover the local places that cater to gluten free foods in Columbus, I move back to the Akron-Canton area. The food I missed the most? PIZZA.   Imagine my complete surprise when I discovered Altieri's Pizza. Not only can I have 12 of their 14 delicious pizzas as gluten free but the customer service was outstanding as well. I would make a call for pizza after my boyfriend's soccer game and twenty minutes later we were picking up pizza on the way home that we were sure to devour in complete satisfaction. Also, they were more than helpful when we asked for any pizza minus the meat, as vegetarians. The pizza makers at Altieri's not only remembered our phone number when we called but also remembered this tidbit of information, always confirming that we wanted our pizzas without the meat. Turned off by carry out only? Don't be, because when you go in to pick up your delicious pizza (or pasta), they have a sample of the pizza of the day (one for each customer!).    Why not 5 stars you might ask? The only thing standing between Aliteri and a five star review is while the gluten free pizza is delicious it only comes in a 10' (4 large slice) size. Despite this I will continue going to Altieri's for my pizza loving cravings."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and gelato!! Staff is super friendly. Called for carry out on a Friday night and it was done in the time frame stated. Pizza was delicious even warmed up in the oven the next day."}
{"text":"I absolutely love altieri's pizza. Due to my celiac disease, it can be very difficult to find gluten free pizza that you can trust and that doesn't taste like cardboard. Their gluten free pizza is amazing and you can get almost any of their speciality pizzas on gluten free crust. My favorite is margherita pizza. They also have gluten free chicken jo jos and wings on Tuesday and Wednesdays which taste better than the real thing! I will definitely be ordering from here frequently and cannot wait to try the gluten free pasta."}
{"text":"Not actually \"good for groups\" as you can't actually dine-in here.  That aside, the pizza is fantastic.  Their specialty pies are very creative.  Not cheap, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Next up on my quest to find the best wings was Altieri's Pizza. And these are going to be hard to beat! They were perfectly cooked and glazed with an absolutely delicious homemade buffalo sauce.   In addition to the wings I also tried one of their crustless pizzas. I wasn't completely sure what to expect but it was as perfect as I could imagine one to be. Often times, pizza places that have been around for half a century seem to be boring and use the same, old, flavorless recipe that people must've liked back in the 60's. But Altieri's was fantastic. They used fresh, generously portioned ingredients and were not afraid to add a little flavor!"}
{"text":"So, I was feeling lazy one night and itching for some pizza but didn't want to drive far.  I tried Aliteri's a second time and have to say the pizza was pretty awesome...better than before.  My conclusion is that I didn't know what I was getting into the first time with gluten-free crust...I guess it's not my thing, but it's awesome that it is an option for those who follow those diets.  I bumped this from 3 to 4 stars because their pizza is actually very good pizza.  And they give free pizza-of-the-month sample slices:)"}
{"text":"Gluten Free Pizza from Altieri's is 5 STARS! All of the pizza selections at Altieri's are fantastic!  I recommend to anyone on  GF diet, or not! Thank you Altieri's!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of amazing.  I can't begin to explain how awesome the staff made me feel being a customer of there's by handing out free samples of pizza and pie. Showing me my order before I left and making sure I was completely satisfied before I stepped out the door.  The food was awesome the chicken perfectly crispy and juicy. The pizza was amazing a nice light crust with an ever so slight crunch to it. I'm not sure the complaints of service my order was ready when I walked in and I ordered on a Saturday night.  They made my experience personal and cared about the product they were selling me. I will recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"4 Months ago about 9 oclock at night and I was hungry. That's how all great pizza stories start right? I called Altieri's and placed an order for my favorite pizza (pep,shrooms and extra cheese) and 20 mins later I showed up at their shop. Pizza was piping hot and ready to go and for the road they gave me a slice of their steak pizza. The steak pizza was AMAZING on my short ride home I devoured the single slice of steak Pizza. I got home and ate a few slices of my custom order also very good. Needless to say I have been back several times and haven't bothered to call another shop. Their steak and white pizzas have become my favorite. I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone there."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza around & the cannolis are to die for. The meatball sub is huge, cheesy & delicious."}
{"text":"Food is always good and orders are always correct!!! They have helped me out with very large, short notice orders on several occasions. Become a VIP customer and you get BOGO and other offers.  Take out only."}
{"text":"Great gluten-free pizza!  I was worried I would have to live without pizza once I was diagnosed with Celiac."}
{"text":"Best pizza and fried chicken in this area! With all the chain pizza shops out there it is difficult and boring finding one worth eating. Drove into the next city to try something different and quickly became loyal customers. We love the fact that they have monthly pizzas to try. While some aren't for our family some we can't get enough of and order several times during the monthly run. We recently moved right down the road and can't wait to order and try more. While delivery would be nice it is refreshing going into a local shop and seeing friendly faces.  Pizza- Amazing Fried Chicken-Out of this World Wings- Not my favorite Salads- Can you really ever go wrong with a salad? Not really, but their homemade Italian dressing is delicious.  Subs- Good, and even better whenever they have the daily deal on them.  Gluten Free menu- Haha I like my carbs way too much to try them, but have heard great things about them.  Try it and you will see why they have great reviews and loyal customers!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Salad and garlic knots are awesome and I love the different ki d's of pizza they have. Great fried chicken and jojos as well if you are not in the mood for traditional Italian. This is one of our go-to places."}
{"text":"Wheat Spinach Souffle Pizza is incredible! I've had the lasagna rolls from here as well and they are terrific. Also, they are actually very polite."}
{"text":"They must know I am starving everytime I come- always sending me away with \"a snack!\" Jk- they are always making a speciality pizza and send you home with a slice. This joint is outstanding every visit! Pizza is great (sausage and onion combo)! Excellent salad dressing. You really can't go wrong stopping in. Oh and they have gluten free pizzas too!!!"}
