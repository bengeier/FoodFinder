{"text":"I've been visiting Yung Sing since I was a little child when Sunday lunches comprised of a bun and maybe a spring roll or an egg tart from here. I can say the place really hasn't changed in 25+ years. Sure, the staff speak English better now but this place is a Baldwin Street institution in my mind.   The staff are super friendly and it appears as though it's run by the kids of the original owners. They used to close for a month or two between August and September (much to the chagrin of my stomach), but I'm not sure if they still do.   I crave the bbq pork buns which are stuffed with sweet bbq pork with a glazed sweet top. You really can't go wrong with anything here and at such great prices you'll be full in no time."}
{"text":"While I whole heartedly agree with the positive reviews here, this Chinese pastry shop on Baldwin has been \"closed for renovations\" for at least since early 2010... I think it shut down in Nov 2009. The windows are boarded up with a sign thanking their customers for their patronage and that they plan to re-open in 2010.  It was still closed as of late June 2010.....  They had Tofu Buns which were delicious."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Yung Sing Bakery for well over 10 years. It's one of the few places you can fill your tummy with yummy food for under $5. I started off with one of their famous buns stuffed with curry beef and have since progressed through their entire menu. Current favorites is the Woo Kok and the Shrimp Rolls. I also really like the sesame balls, they make for a scrumptious dessert.   For all the years I've gone to the Yung Sing Bakery the staff have always been super friendly. It's a family business and you can feel the difference in how they approach their customers. Whether you are a regular or it's your first time, be sure you'll get a smile and prompt service.  It should be noted that some of their items are deep fried and so if you are diet conscious you may take that into consideration. Also I find it's better to go not too late in the day as the pastries tend to be fresher. Finally I'll mention that Yung Sing Bakery will be closing for renovations come end November 2009 and will not reopen till spring of 2010. So head down now while you have the chance!"}
{"text":"A good place to go on nice, sunny days to escape the office towers surrounding University Ave. The tofu bun and the fried rice buns are similar.  Buttered or put in a pan to heat up, the buns are then filled with fried scrambled eggs-like tofu with decent seasoning or aforementioned fried rice.  Well, healthy it is not.  It took me a few trips to realize that just because they are only a buck a piece that I shouldn't order 3 of them!  Too much food. I might be able to finish 2, if I am feeling greedy.  Or get one bun and one sweet. Well- come to think of it, all the other food here is fried, too. Well, it nice to sit on the patio and get out of the office."}
{"text":"This is the original Chinese Bun place in Toronto...I've been going here since when in Med School @ U of T we ate lunch here almost every day! The most amazing thing about the place is the old man who runs it (now with his kids) looks identical to how he looked thirty years ago! Must  be some sort of fountain of youth in the buns! Still incredibly cheap prices."}
{"text":"Yung Sing Pastry Shop - filling the U of T student belly for pennies since 1968.  The famous buns (BBQ pork, curry beef, tofu, veggie...) aren't the world's greatest. The fillings are good but the buns themselves alternate between stale and soggy. There are probably better and cheaper bun bakeries to be found along Spadina or Dundas, but for ambiance, none can compete with this vintage shop front on charming Baldwin Street.  Personally, I'm partial to the non-bun menu. I like to buy little packages of steamed seafood rice wraps, dumplings, hot and sour soup and other similar daily items. I like the sesame balls and egg tarts, too.  Tourists to Toronto may note that Yung Sing is very near the Art Gallery of Ontario: this would be a good spot to fuel up on a snack before you head inside. There's a solitary picnic bench in front of Yung Sing or you can carry your grease-soaked paper bag to the steps of the AGO."}
{"text":"Great tasting and very cheap Chinese snacks. My favourites are the shrimp rolls and the stuffed buns. I have yet to try a lot of the options offered here though.  If you are ever around Baldwin Village but not in the mood for a meal, this should be your first stop!"}
{"text":"was Great place for affordable red bean pastry but unfort. closed.."}
{"text":"I like the look of this place more than anything.  It's real cute and they sell cute looking food (buns are cute) that's so greasy it makes me wanna blot out the inside of my mouth after.  I forgot about this place and will need to visit it shortly."}
