{"text":"Bar area is relatively small very dark, very smoky. They have a restaurant side if you don't like smoking or dark bars.  Food was good, above average for this type of restaurant, hence 4 stars. I had the basil pest chicken sandwich. Bartender was attentive."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm finally getting further into the realm of unique local Vegas spots off the strip, which is great not just for the blog but also my bank account. The $19 burgers in the casinos are starting to take a toll on me, literally, so coming across the $4.99(!) burger at Henry's American Grill in Henderson was exciting and promised big things based on all the Yelp comments. And although I had a couple complaints as I always do, this turned out to be a good visit.  Henry's is located deep in Henderson in a typical strip of retail, and seems like every other bar from the outside. And honestly it's not very fancy or different on the inside either, but this is what to expect of a local pub, you're not really going for the ambiance. I went at lunchtime but the restaurant side was completely empty and didn't even look open so I ventured to the stinky bar side. I sat down at one of the high tops away from the bar, but I wish someone could have told me the restaurant side was indeed open because I was the only person out of a handful not smoking. There were a few regulars drinking at the bar around noon, and it seemed like a friendly local spot.  The menu has typical pub faire; pizza, burgers, salad, supposedly a decent breakfast...but I was there for the burgers that many locals have claimed to be the best in town. They offer a handful of 'specialty burgers' including a Bourbon BBQ, Mushroom Bleu Cheese, Southwestern, Nacho and a couple others, but the stars of the menu are the $3.99 Hamburger and $4.99 Cheeseburger, both with' the works.' They even tout this on their menu as an \"awesome burger at an awesome price.\" For sides you have some interesting choices: freedom fries, coleslaw, pasta salad, jasmine rice or fresh fruit. I've heard some great things about the bleu cheese cream sauce, but I had to see if the $4.99 awesome burger really was as claimed.  The verdict? For $4.99 it's pretty damn good. The meat has really great char flavor, and just good meat flavor overall. My medium-rare burger came out as ordered, and my cheese was melted. The bun was good, it got a tiny bit soggy from the juiciness of the burger but held together. The special sauce really wasn't too noticeable until one of my bites near the end, almost a red relish kind of sauce that tasted pretty good and made me wish it was a little more present sooner. This wasn't an overly fancy burger that you'd find at Burger Bar or Bachi, but it was really good.  And of course I'm never completely happy, as the fries were really not good. I'm getting really tired of the fries being the one aspect that brings down my meal; they're such an important yet neglected part of a burger meal. They looked like they could be good, but just didn't have any great flavor to them and were a bit soggy for my taste. I have no doubt that I would give this overall meal a much higher score if I were happier about the fries. At $4.99 this is a really great deal, combined with some amazing fries and it could become a really special gem off the strip for burger lovers. It's still definitely worth the price as maybe the fries are sometimes inconsistent? Either way, check it out based on the price alone."}
{"text":"I recently went to Henry's after reading wonderful reviews on Yelp. I had the pot roast meal that was absolutely amazing! The service was great and price was even better. I will be coming back as often as I can!"}
{"text":"Had family show up unexpectedly on a Sunday and with it being VD weekend, nearly every place was booked for hours.  Henry's had PLENTY of room, and now I understand why. As soon as we got there, our eyes began burning from the smoke drifting in from the bar next door. My wife whispered to me when I noticed it, but we were trying to be nice since someone else was picking up the tab.  There were 3 tables occupied when we got there. It took almost 15 minutes before someone came for our drink order, and we barely interacted with our server for the remainder of the meal. The soda was flat, but she was nice enough to bring us each our own mini-pitcher. I ordered the ribeye (med-rare) and a Caesar salad. The salad was absolutely drowning in dressing and soggy.  Well over an hour after we sat down we finally had our entrees. The steak was good. Not exceptional, but more than I had expected. Some parts of it were over-charred/dry and it really detracted from the natural flavor of the meat. It was a very fatty/sinewy cut, and I felt mislead by the quality promised on the menu. They served it with peas that didn't seem to be seasoned at all and could have come right out of your grocer's freezer.  The fries and barbecue sauce were a bright spot. Both had great flavor and were absolutely addicting. Unfortunately that didn't save a very disappointing dining experience."}
{"text":"Ate here last night, 7 in our group. Place was perfect and very homey. The food came out quick and everything was delicious. Kristin was our server and she did an awesome job! Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"We continue to return to Henry's hoping it becomes more consistent. When they get it all right - it is fantastic and the food is wonderful. But, when they get it wrong, it is really bad.   Our family favorite is Thursday night, prime rib night. Most of the time the food is right on. But, I have eaten there where the rolls have been over cooked, prime rib is over cooked, vegetables look like they have been around since the beginning of time and then on top of it, the food is served cold. There breakfast is good and burgers are a great deal. Service isn't good if the motorcycle club is there. Too many people to be served at once. We have suffered through this enough, that we no longer go when we see the club there. When club isn't there, service is fantastic.  I wish that the food could be good all the time or at least most of the time."}
{"text":"We (9 people) had an incredible breakfast this morning. Everyone loved their entrees! Best pancakes and hot chocolate!"}
{"text":"Open late love that great service and food felt right at home shrimp and fries and Mac and cheese to die for yummo!"}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks sketchy...BUT I have to say when we entered we were greeted by a very nice gal and the service was great.  The chef seemed awesome and was interactive with us. I had a pulled pork sandwich and it was really tasty and good sized. Came with sweet potato fries that were solid as well. Not a bad little hole in the wall!"}
{"text":"Love this little place.  The food was delicious, and our server was the cute lil country girl.  I don't remember her name, but she was a sweetheart.  And she gave the best service I've had in a place in a long time."}
{"text":"Good quality food,  they appear to have an actual chef on staff. The service can be a bit slow at times, but the food is really good. If you're hungry try \"the Hank\"."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with a lot of choices, had the breakfast with the best hash browns i've ever had, service was great and prices were reasonable. Check it out, there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"I chose this place strictly for the yelp rating. Yelp is typically pretty accurate. Brought my wife and kids. The place is half restaurant  half bar. Separated by a glass door.   The food  We'll start here, 'cause that's what's important. we ordered the fried clams (pretty good), \"the world's best\" macaroni......not so much. I'm pretty sure it had turned bad already. Everything else was barely mediocre.   Service  Our waitress was a very nice lady, but unfortunately the worst waitress.....ever. she took forever to do anything. She was around, just didn't react to things you'd expect. Missing silverware and napkins. You basically were better off getting things from the kitchen yourself.   Location  Outside looks good. Inside, the smoke smell was like the old Klondike casino. I am a hardcore smoker, and don't mind indoor smoke smell when I'm drinking or with buddies, but I want my kids to choose whether they want to smoke or not. It definitely should not be advertised as a family establishment."}
{"text":"My family and I went to eat there last month. The eating/dining area was about 1/3 full so not extremely busy or packed. We seated ourselves and waited over 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us by getting us our beverages and taking the order. The one waitress ran past us and said she would be right back but still ignored us. There were two men working as well but offered no help or service. We walked out due to this poor service and we have always enjoyed eating at this establishment. We won't be back ...."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved to Henderson and this was the first place we got to experience. After a day of apartment hunting we were starving and this place came up. AMAZING service. Nothing fancy. It was pretty empty but that actually enhanced the experience for us. Our waitress was AWESOME and pretty much had the entire place to herself which allowed her to spend a little more time with each table. There are times when you go to a restaurant and you feel rushed because they're so busy. Not here. She gave us time and was available to answer any questions we had.   I had the Savannah burger and OH MY GOD was it delicious. Cooked to perfection. My wife had a burger as well and enjoyed as well as my mother in law who had a salad and was highly impressed. We split the brownie sundae for dessert and left excited and FULL.   This place is great if you just want some delicious food and SPACE to enjoy it. There is a bar section on the other side, but it's kinda dark and smokey so we decided against it. I'm sure the service is just as good in there."}
{"text":"We tripped into this place totally on an emergent basis.  We had planned to go to Bistro Pizza and were on the way to a show on the strip but missed the detail that Bistro is closed on Tuesday's.  My son, planner and navigator who missed the Tuesday detail quickly came up with Henry's as it was pretty close and well rated on Yelp.  Very lucky for us... and him.  The food was tasty, generous and served hot and fast.  And did I mention well priced.  I had a drink and it was a healthy pour.  We ate in the restaurant side, the bar looked a bit sketchy.  My son had a burger that was huge and I am a club sandwich fan so went that route.  I am a big guy but could not get my mouth over a quartered hunk of that sandwich.  The only reason they aren't a 5 star is the decor and that the sandwiches were out of scale.  Server was very nice, great food, well priced and pretty easy to find.  Give it a try if you are looking for good pub grub or comfort food and don't need the restaurant chain overlay."}
{"text":"We like the food here at Henry's American grill but this time I order a avocado burger and the chef Jeremy gave me a raw avocado, yes you heard me right raw, I had to send it back and I couldn't understand when the chef was cutting it he should have know it was raw that's why I'm giving a one star."}
{"text":"My son has wanted a good burger.  He ordered the Nacho Burger.  He said it was very good.  I ordered then Philly Cheesesteak.  The waitress suggested not to have the cheese sauce and only have the mozzarella.  I should have listened.  It was still very good.    My son has sweet potato tots.  Never heard of sweet potatoes like this, but they were good.  I got regular fries.  Nothing regular about them.   Probably one of the best fries in the valley.  They were extra crispy on the outside, while still soft and tasting like a potato on the inside.  We will definitely go back yo try other menu items."}
{"text":"Very good food, especially for a bar. Bar is very well insulated from dining area. No bar noise or smoke smell. Wait staff friendly and attentive.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"If you want to have a nice long lunch with friends, good food, and not feel rushed to leave, Henry's is the place. I've been going to Henry's for lunch for a few years and have never been disappointed. Everything I've tried has been really good (I'm addicted to the buffalo chicken fingers) and getting your own pitcher of iced-tea, water, whatever, is a really nice feature. The service is very friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"I love this place, its a relaxing atmosphere and friendly machines. The bartenders are inviting and experienced. I highly  recommend this bar and restaurant. Brian, Andrew, Danii and a Heather are the best bartenders in town."}
{"text":"Found out about Henry's via Yelp. First walked into the bar side, but being a nonsmoker, had to retreat to the restaurant side. Service was quick and friendly. Asked the waitress for her recommendation and she suggested the Hank or a Burger. Went for the Hank, and a Nut brown beer. Food and drink came quick.  Large prime rib with lots of crunchy fries. Beer was good and nice and cold, not flat or warm.  Generous amount of peppers and onions on the sandwich.  Was hot fresh and tasty. Prime rib was cut nice with little fat but still juicy and tender.  Only criticism would be that the bread got a little soggy.  Ended up eating second half with fork and left bread.  I would recommend Henry's to anyone that is looking for good food at a good price. Was not blown away, but was happy overall. I would come back."}
{"text":"I have been going there for about 4 years.  The owner fired Mary the graveyard bartender for no reason.  I spend 300 to 500$ a week gambling in there and have friends that only went on her shift.  The belief is that he did not want to promote within. I wish him the best luck because that is a horrible way to run your business.  She did a great job and has a good following and if u go on another graveyard shift there is no one there except for tumble weeds.  I encounter and speak to many people and will encourage to go somewhere else. Village pub is where I will be.  Better promotions for gamers.  I only went there because of her as did her following.  I would never want to go where they serve food to underage patrons on graveyard.  Which they did on the male bartenders shift.  So if u read this hopefully I will c u at village pub."}
{"text":"The kitchen is incredible for such a \"bar feel\" atmosphere. (I went late, sat in the bar area, the \"café\" looking area was closed. This review does not comment on that.) Portion sizes are big, which is one of my favorite things about the $9.50 blue cheese burger, next to the sauce. Fries were pretty good and for it being essentially a sports bar (they had the Olympics on) I would normally have given this a much higher rating. The service was good, great almost. Problem was my bartender seemed a little bit off, which is something I am used to in Las Vegas. He did take longer to bring me the check then the food- next time I will ask ahead of time I think.... Lastly, and this is a big one.... I didn't get asked a temperature on my burger.  Don't know if they just don't take temperatures or not, but I would've liked it pulled off the girl probably 5-8 minutes before it was...."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.  The waitress was amazing, funny and very accommodating.  The hamburger fantastic, but the chicken sandwich and Caesar salad were dry.  Overall good dining experience for the dollar."}
{"text":"This place is THE FIND!  Just off the 215 on Stephanie St this jewel is hidden behind an Auto Zone.   Check it out! Open 24 hours. Full bar. Really good food, generous portions and incredible service."}
{"text":"They have a large and varied menu, and the food is usually very good.  But, we have stopped going because the service was very hit/miss.  With one server the service was excellent.  With another it was terrible.  That is always a risk with any restaurant.  The service is very dependent on the specific server.  But, we seemed to get the poor server much more often than the good server.  But, we did enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting fancy because it's not. But it has a large selection on the menu, reasonable prices, great service and good food. I've been searching for a decent burger in the area for a while. I'll post the bad experiences soon. But this burger was perfectly cooked. Meat was good. Bun was fresh. Toppings were good. My friend got the Thursday prime rib special. Queen size for 14.99. He couldn't finish it., had to take half home.  The fries were very tasty.  Worth a return trip!"}
{"text":"Henry's is a great neighborhood Restaurant / Bar.  I'm not much of a drinker or gambler, so the bar side I'll leave to other people to review.   Food is excellent. , staff is always friendly and very attentive.  Price is excellent for the quality and quantity of food you get.  I consider myself someone with a good appetite and most times I cannot finish my plate.  Great place, check it out, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service, best bartenders in the word. I've been going to Henreys for 16 or so yrs., I've never had anything but a great time. Even the. Us timers are friendly and happy. Just a nice place to go."}
{"text":"The waitress was nice and should have ordered what she recommended but I ordered nachos lol why do I order nachos. I wish restaurants could make right but I guess its not economical. All you do is open a bag of chips. Stop trying to fry your own. You then put guacamole cheese not nacho unless its really good cheese sour cream and use a scoop. Add chicken which I didn't but it wouldn't of mattered. A good salsa olives etc. If people can't make right don't put it on your menu or make really good in smaller portions."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Henry's when I moved to the area a few years back.  I kept driving past and thought I've got to go in there one day.  Well, one day I did and I've never stopped.  Though I haven't sampled much of their menu, the burgers are the best I've had in town.  Maybe I'm boring because I always order the same thing, but when something is that good you stick with it.  I don't want to forget to mention St. Patrick's Day, where their corned beef and cabbage is out of this world.  Yum.  Yum.  The beers are priced right, especially during football season.  Oh - a big shout out to Shelley who is the best waitress in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Went on a whim and tried a place I've never heard of or even been to. Tried my YELP app and found this place and was really impressed the food was delicious. I had the Salisbury steak w/ mash potatoes & gravy, green beans and a roll. Pretty good portion. I would recommend this place. I definitely will come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what I expected when we walked in but we got immediately greeted, and seated. Genuine service, quality music, and classic decorations gave this place a feel of a bar & grill from the early 90's. The food came, it looked incredible and it smelled even better. Put simply; best milkshake I've ever had, one of the best burgers I've ever had. Recommendation to people of all ages."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic!!!!! Great atmosphere but definitely wish the hostess was a bit nicer..."}
{"text":"Love the restaurant side. The wife and kids go here every Sunday for breakfast. It's kind of a tradition now and our food and service is great every time. The wife orders the veggie omelet every time and I get the chicken fried steak. Excellent every time. Nothing fancy but very clean and the waitresses are always very courteous and prompt."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem had Lunch and BLT platter was yummy & fries as well loved the little pitcher of soda given with meal ( too cool) my wife had fish hoagie & clam chowder soup both great & service as well, Today we had breakfast Dec 26th we had breakfast Denver omelet & Hash browns for myself & two egg breakfast wish we both enjoyed & once again service was GREAT and music as well ! A place to go for great food & music and service! Waiting for our dinner review then they will get 5TARS ( i'm sure)"}
{"text":"I come here just for those late-night munchies after a long day of working and/or studying. The service is slower because there's only 1 waiter past midnight, but the prices can't be beat.  The pulled pork sandwich and waffle fries are a classic combo, and you can order many things on the menu past midnight and the bill will rarely go past $10 because of their late-night deals. Their pulled-pork sandwich is made just right with tender pork and soft bread. The waffle fries are your everyday fries and you can mix them in with your sandwich for a one-way ticket to no-regrets guilty eating.  The staff is friendly as you cant find past midnight, but the place itself has a cigarette aroma because of the bar next door.  The service is slow, but I bring study materials to work on while I wait for my food.  I would recommend anyone looking for late night food to come here for a good pit stop between study sessions."}
{"text":"DRIVE TIME / WAIT: After reading many rave reviews over this place I decided to give it a shot. We live in the GVR/Anthem area and it was a short drive from our house. Less than 15 mins. For the first visit, I wanted to get take-out. I actually TIMED them with a stop watch app on my phone. They had my order ready within 8 minutes! :)  SETTING/THEME: First off, I've seen many people complain about the \"darkness\" of the place. Well, as it turns out I think it looks GREAT and I love low lighted settings (think Outback SteakHouse or Red Lobster). Bright, sunlit places actually annoy me because I'm squinting my eyes the whole time. They have the restaurant and gaming/bar sections separated by solid walls and a dark tinted black door, which I felt was a nice touch and clever. The restaurant section was one really big room with good distance between tables so no one would EVER feel crowded. All the furnishings were made of soft, light colored, polished wood with plenty of padded booths and tables for 4 available.  CROWD: Personally, I wish more young people would explore their food options. There are so many wonderful places to eat in Las Vegas and it seems the only people who know about these wonderful places are senior citizens and \"foodies\" like me. This place has a staff of waitresses in their 40s+. There were 3 senior citizen couples there as customers eating in. They all must've been at least 50+.  WHAT I ORDERED: 2 double cheeseburgers with bleu cheese and \"the works\" + 1 order of fries.  COST: $17.60 total. They were a tad bit expensive. If they would drop all their prices just $1, they would OWN this valley!   FOOD: The burgers were clearly hand crafted and well seasoned 100% real beef. The patties were huge. I would compare them to Five Guys Burgers and Fries, both the burgers and the fries. However, Henry's American Grill's patties are slightly bigger than Five Guys'. the burgers were delicious.   The fries were home cooked style regular sized seasoned fries. I prefer light crispy shoestring fries myself so the fries here seemed sub-par to me.  The one thing I found disappointing was that I ordered blue cheese and they only gave me a small dab of bleu cheese. I would've expected 3-4 dabs for that price. If I had ordered American, Swiss, or any other cheese, you would have given me a full slice. So, why is it when I order Bleu Cheese, you give me 1/4 of the amount of cheese I would normally get?  CHANCE OF RETURN: Definitely! They have some great stuff on their menu I'd like to try. Like the whiskey glazed bread pudding,. and pulled pork sandwiches.  I'm @MakellBird on twitter. Follow me!"}
{"text":"No thanks.... I'm sure the food is good, but as far as the gaming area is eh..... Ventilation for smoking is bad and some of the people that go there very rude. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"If you're not looking for this place, you just might miss it. It's tucked away in a strip mall and worth the hunt. I went with Elite Emily as we explored Henderson more, and we were practically the only people in the spot. The orders were HUGE. It takes a lot for me to wave the white flag, but I had to ask for a box. All the food is fresh and pretty dern tasty. There's really nothing you can go wrong with here, so I'm looking forward to my next trip to try something else!"}
{"text":"The place was dark. I don't care for these restaurants that are dark inside. No one was there to greet me and the service was not any better after that. The worst thing was that my pancakes were not fully cooked. It was raw in the middle."}
{"text":"Very diner like. Extensive menu and definitely something for everyone. Great service.  Good restaurant choice for the area for sure! Any place that roasts their own turkey and serves fresh mashed potatoes and gravy rates in my book."}
{"text":"the gf and i take a trip to Henderson to visit furniture stores and flooring stores in preparation for our upcoming move - as you might imagine, i'm in a shit mood since this isn't how i like to spend a saturday afternoon.  we hit the gym first for a quick work out then \"brunch\" before the games begin.  Haven't been to Henry's in years, liked it the first time i went there so why not ?  I was a lil miffed waiting a few minutes after being seated before our drink orders taken ( place not that busy ) even more miffed that after we ordered our food, two other couples come into the place, seated,  orders taken AND they get their food before we do !  The food ?  GF ordered a veggie omelet ( after the list of veggies ordered along with egg white - cost $11.50) - it was a sorry looking omelet - small, browned to imperfection and the veggies were greasy ( she asked for no oil )   I went with the pot roast hash ( i believe it cost $10.95 ) - although a little on the greasy side, the hash was pretty tasty.  But a major ding that my eggs ( requested over easy ) came out with firm yolks.  bummer.  GF liked that with my diet coke order, they brought over a \"mini-pitcher\"  of DC so no need to ask for refills.  The slow service and piss poor omelet means no future visits.    crappy pics attached"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE TO DEATH!!!! MY favorite place to come to on a Friday night after a long week of working. SO nice to come here and relax , drink and eat. The staff is so nice and considerate here."}
{"text":"Henry's is really a great little secret that I really want the world to know. Henry's is a place that just simply gets it when it comes down to making a perfect hamburger or for any sandwich for that matter. They are spot on all their menu items.  To start, their menu is an eclectic display of the American menu - burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizzas and breakfasts.  I haven't had a meal I didn't like there.  My two favorites are their burgers and their Prime Rib sandwich called 'The Hank'.  This is a must sandwich everyone needs to try one time - request it medium rare.  Believe me, it's the perfect blend of flavors mixed in with the cheese, green bell peppers and onions.  On top of that adding another layer of flavors when you dip it in the au jus, totally tantalizing the tastebuds.  Although, most folks may think it's bar food.  The restaurant side is family friendly - it's simple and service is timely."}
{"text":"Came here with my roommate for late night drinks and food.  I got the prime rib sandwich. It was kind of salty and the cheese made it too greasy for my taste.  The fries were really good.  Cheap drinks.  Would probably come here again but try something else"}
{"text":"First time going , very yummy . Definitely will be back its open 24 hours so its great for anytime and occasion."}
{"text":"Can only order burgers WELL DONE...no exceptions. While it is not dry, it is not provided the way that the customer wants. On top of that, charging for a side of ranch? Really? Good thing I didn't ask for extra napkins!"}
{"text":"It's says on here they're open 24/7, and the hostess said they were open (at 10:30 on a Tuesday night) but our waiter refused us service and kicked us out. Needless to say we'll never go there again."}
{"text":"I must say this place is amazing. I seen it for a few years but never tried. Finally I decided to give it a shot. Being in a strip mall makes anyone have doubts. Went in and asked the most important question. Do you use trans fat free oil?? Yes!! Perfect, I'm in. The cool part is the inside. Modern look and cozy atmosphere. They have one side restaurant and the other side is bar, some bar machines and tables. The menu is straight up COMFORT food. They specialize in American Fusion. From their Famous Mac n Cheese, Pot Roast Sandwich with Buttery Mash Potatoes and bourbon glazed carrots, Citrus Marinated Chicken Fingers from Scratch with up to 12 sauces to try. Incredible selection of hand made burgers and fresh made pizza. Interesting to say the least. They have a Cheeseburger Pizza with mustard, ketchup, onions, pickles, burger, lettuce and tomato. Im sure thats whats in it, can't remember since I don't have the menu in front of me lol. Someone had ordered it across from us and it looked freaking good. The Nacho Burger was amazing. Big hand made beef patty, grilled to perfection, topped with black olives, jalapeños, tortilla chips, nacho cheese sauce on a toasted bun with Freedom Fries. Gooey goodness on a perfectly cooked beef patty. The Blackened Chicken Sandwich was spectacular. Marinated and blackened seasoned Chicken breast on a toasted wheat bun, topped with pineapple salsa, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions and served with Freedom Fries. The Fries are so crispy and perfectly seasoned with their own special seasoning salt. They definitely make you addicted. I felt like a pig after devouring everything and wanting more fries. But I resisted lol. The chicken fingers were AMAZING!!! Fresh chicken fillets that are marinated in Citrus. Then freshly hand battered and fried perfectly crisp. The sauces to choose from range from mild to Nuclear hot. They even have a caption no refunds if its to hot lol. I prefer Buffalo Hot cuz I iove the flavor or an authentic buffalo wing. I can go on and on. The menu is definitely something try and enjoy. Can't wait to try some of their pastas and comfort food selections. Until next time, LET'S EAT!!!!"}
{"text":"Judging by the name and font on the storefront, I would never have known this was a mom n' pop kind of place. Once you seat yourself inside and look around, you'll continue to wonder \"where am I\". The décor is not exactly consistent...it is a dinner, in a strip mall, with Tuscany-wine themed décor, and bathrooms that have industrial metal doors...hmmm...good thing I wasn't eating \"décor\" or we would have had a problem.  I instead noshed on the decadent sweet potato puffs (deep fried perfectly) and the gilled prime rib sandwich with my guest - who, btw, loved the sandwich. I was not a fan because I couldn't get past the undertones of ancho seasoning - which haunted me until I dissected my sandwich to thoroughly figure out what I tasted. Beyond the misfit of seasoning, the sandwich was fine and paired well with the (properly seasoned) pasta salad. Onion rings were on par...but, again, I need to stress how delicious the sweet potato puffs are and cutely served in a lil' metal basket!!  The menu is several pages of comfort food, the booths are big and could fit 6 people, they offer 24/hr. service, and beverages in big glasses...our server even placed a carafe of iced tea at our table which was a nice touch. Service was prompt and enthusiastic. Very clean place with an open kitchen area that was spotless!  I will return soon; can't wait to stroll in here with the hubs on a lazy Saturday when he is craving gravy fries or a hot turkey sandwich! Henry's will be the perfect fit!"}
{"text":"So I came a second time, my ooh my... This place is awesome. It was rather empty when I came in again but I do like dining quiet. The service was amazing. The food was great, all of it was fresh and it was served fast. I got the German burger, it has 2 quarter pound patties, sour kraut, corned beef and all the traditional toppings with a beautiful melted thick slice of Swiss cheese. My gf get the basil pesto sandwich which she adored. And the chips and salsa are a great appetizer ( the salsa is the best in vegas). Please dine here and support a small great Henderson business."}
{"text":"Poorly ran business.   People walk in and seat themselves then look around for a waiter. Food seems like frozen or warmed up leftovers.  The salad was nicely done but the ranch was watery. No one is ever in here but a couple of tables.  Usually 1 waiter.  Sad..  they need Jon Taffer or Gordon Ramsey to help them out."}
{"text":"I swear we've passed by this place many times but never really noticed it.. Thanks to Yelp, today was the day!  We came at a great time, there were two bigger groups in the restaurant and then the four of us.   Our server was great! She was detailed and knowledgeable with the menu items, very friendly and attentive!   The menu is HUGE! Breakfast, lunch, dinner, munchies? They have it!  We decided to try different things and share it-- we got Gravy Fries, World's Best Mac N Cheese, Curry Pasta, Ham Steak, and Cinnamon Texas French Toast!  Just like their menu, their portions are HUGE!!!! Seriously recommend if there's a choice for big or small-- choose the small!  Their prices are very reasonable! Kind of reminds me of Hash House portions but this shits on Hash House!  Definitely a recommend!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a local place that had a good review on Yelp & also had lots of choices. We arrived & there were only 2 other customers, local policeman, which is a good sign. The waitress was very personable & greeted us right away. As we sat looking at the menu, there were numerous to go orders leaving. Our party of 3 chose the Cobb salad, which was huge, the salisbury steak dinner, which also was very large, & the blackened prime rib sandwich. All the choices were great, the food was prepared very well & to order, & the wait was not long at all. We all agreed that it was a great choice & will go back again while we are here in town."}
{"text":"I've driven by this grill so many times and never noticed it!  Thank you fellow yelpers for checking in here.    We stopped in for a Saturday lunch.  It wasn't very busy so we were seated immediately.   Our drinks were brought out in a flash.  The neat idea they have is bringing a mini pitcher for your refills.  You mean I don't have to wait for my refill or flag down the waitress? Love it.  The menu is very extensive.  There is such a variety of meals to choose from including breakfast items.   From pizza to pot roast to a burger... they've got you covered.    A nachos appetizer?  That has Bethany written all over it!  With toppings of cheese, tomatoes, jalapeños and chili, it was surely a winner.  It seemed like no time passed before our nachos were sitting in front of us.  They had a great flavor with salsa and sour cream served on the side.  I'd definitely get these again.  For our entree we split the Pesto Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  It was great!  The warm rosemary focaccia bread enclosed the juicy grilled chicken breast. The melted cheese and roasted red peppers gave it an extraordinary flavor. My husband did like the rosemary flavor... but not loved it like I did.  We all have different tastes.  Crispy french fries were served on the side ~ a great compliment to the sandwich.   I saw they offered sweet potato puffs on the side...  Sure!  Why not?! They were good but not great.  A little too soggy in the middle.  I would suggest sticking with the fries.   Phenomenal service from Lori! She was an absolute delight!  It just makes the dining experience that much more enjoyable.     They are a 24/7 bar and grill so I foresee us stopping in again for sure.  Can't wait to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"If you come here with a large party know that you can count on the staff here to not miss a beat. Brought my group of friends here recently and was impressed that Kim single-handedly managed our table with ease.  Never had to ask for drinks to be refilled, she happily took the special request orders, everything came out on time, and we all were satisfied with our meals.   Reason I updated...well our same group visited another restaurant today where I encountered a server with the worst attitude....ever!  After that poor experience we had at that faux French cafe.down the street on Stephanie, it  made me realize how I appreciate the staff here even more. So bumped up to five stars."}
{"text":"Simply,  Wow!!! Thanks to yelp I found this place .. First time there and I'm super impressed! !! Can't wait to try out more items off the menu. .. I had the prime rib sandwich and it was super delicious! !! Mouth watering good, the meat was perfectly prepared and the au jus was on point! !! I will most definitely be back for more, it's down the street and 24/7, freaken perfect. .."}
{"text":"Glad I was told about this place. I've been twice and both time had the prime rib sandwich!! I  it. Amber Lynn was my waitress and she is very friendly."}
{"text":"came here due to the reviews about the food.... but are a few down falls to this place.  First off, we went on a sat. night, around 730... walked in and there were plenty of empty tables, but most were filled with empty plates and cups from the previous guests.  we stood around for about 5 min not sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait.  so we waited and wactched the 2 waitresses scurry around avoiding us til one said just sit there.  we finally ordered 10 min later and in the time at least 3 more groups of people had walked in, stood around and then left due to being avoided.  the food came out fast, and it was tastey, except for my undercooked chicken that i finally let the waitress know about once she came back 15 min later, she quickly apologized and offered to fully comp my chicken dish and offer me something new, but it was ok.  food was great: chicken wings, fries and chicken fried steak... southwest chicken salad... eh  service was VERY slow...   but all in all, it was ok... just have to be patient"}
{"text":"Fabulousness!!!  Kristin rocks!!  Food was so good, and they play the best music of any restaurant I have ever been in. I heard Doors, Zepplin, super tramp and ELP all in one sitting. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are ok. The ribeye and mashed potatoes were flavorless. Stay in the restaurant area, your clothes will smell like smoke in the bar. The waitstaff and bartenders are cool. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Ok. So I was really torn. I wanted to give this place a  better review, but in good conscience I can't recommend this place. I'll get to that, but a few good things to point out first.  The pulled pork sandwich was good, but they didn't toast the bun. So the sauce and the juice from the pork just turned it into inedible mush. But! Some pork on the fries with some cheese and jalapeños would have been awesome. Or just toast the bun.   My wife liked her turkey sandwich dinner thing. Hot turkey sandwich or something. Normally served open face, but here they don't do that.   Here's where the 1 star comes from: Ordered chicken wings. They were ICE cold in the middle. Hot on the outside, FREEZING on the inside. She offered to have them remade which I was fine with, but the second batch came out rubbery. So this tells me they aren't properly cooking and/or thawing the chicken. It's gonna get someone sick and even though I liked the pulled pork and the fries and my wife liked her turkey I can't suggest to you to go here if they can't cook wings safely.   Our waitress was wonderful, the bar area was nice ( a little Smokey but not too bad. Didn't bother my wife with asthma). They had TV's but smaller ones so it was ok for watching a game but not ideal.   Had the wings not been getting people sick would have gone 3 maybe 4 stars. But I doubt those bad food handling habits are isolated to just their wings."}
{"text":"Overall, I like this place and will eat here again.  My family of 4 tried this place on a Sunday early afternoon.  The place was not crowded, but walking in we weren't sure whether to seat ourselves or wait.  So after a minute of waiting, we just decided to sit down.  It took awhile to get menus or a drink order although the waitress did acknowledge us after we got seated.  She was very friendly and once we were finally waited on, the service was great.  The food was good - portions were enormous!  My daughter had the mac and cheese which she loved (it had roasted red peppers in it which was yummy).  I had a nacho burger. I liked it, but it was so sloppy it shouldn't have come with a bun.  In fact, I ended up eating it with a fork and leaving the bun on the plate.  I think any of the other burgers would have been better - the burger itself was good but the flavors of the \"nacho\" toppings did nothing for me.  I like that they bring out little pitchers of soda so you don't have to wait for refills.  I don't know why, but that was kind of cool. The restaurant itself is clean and comfortable. The décor was not memorable but for a family meal in a diner like this, we didn't come here for the décor.    The prices were average but the portions were worth it.  We'll try Henry's again one day for sure."}
{"text":"We were really pressed for time on our way to Lake Mead from Vegas and picked this place solely because it was nearby and had a really high rating. I can see locals having a favorite item on the menu and rating this place a five, I can, but it's probably not ideal for people who aren't familiar with the menu and don't have a high tolerance for cigarette and cigar smoke.  The food was okay. The portions were enormous. The service was excellent. The restaurant was clean.  The overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke had a negative effect on our appetites and we couldn't do the portions justice. I ordered a burger, which included zero sides, and an order of their gravy fries. The burger was meh, the fries were fantastic (SERIOUSLY. If my entire experience was based solely on the gravy fries, it would be five stars.), and together they cost three times what a burger and fries ought to, even with the ridiculous serving sizes."}
{"text":"Ive only been here once, but so far I am definetly a fan of this place.  1st of all there are 2 entrances, once side goes to a bar, the other goes to the more family friendly area.  We were here during late lunch hours, like 2-3pm.  The menu looked like there was a lot of options that sounded good, but since it was still lunch for us I went with a simple chicken strip meal with fries.  I was going to order 4  chicken strips for my kid, but the nice waitress strongly suggested I go smaller because according to her the chicken strips were huge.  OK, she was NOT lying!!!  We got 6 total for me and my son to share.  These could not be classified as strips, they were like 6 huge chicken breasts and they were cripspy on the outside and very tasty.  My wife ordered a mushroom blueu cheese burger.  Her burger looked amazing (although I do not like mushrooms or blueu cheese).  There was so much bleue cheese sauce and mushrooms all over the place.  In my opinion, better to have too much on it than not enough.  She was thoroughly satisfied with her meal.  I could spend 10 minutes ranting and raving about the fries alone.  They were thick, but yet very crispy on the ouside.  I am not sure what they use, if it's some kind of batter on the fries or what, but I love the crispy texture while maintaining the excellent mushy potato insides.  They also have waffle fries which I will want to try on a future visit.  The waitress was very kind, and patient with us.  We took our time looking over the menu and asking her questions.  They have about 10 sauce flavors to choose from for the wings/fingers.  I tried one my wife thought I might like, but of course I ended up not liking that one..lol.  In the end I settled with the hottest flavor they offer which was pretty darn hot, and I mixed it with a standard hot buffalo sauce for the perfect blend for me.  I did not go into the bar because I was with family and I don't do the bar scene anyways.  Ive also heard it is very smokey in there, but the dinning area was clean and nice.  They have TV's to watch sports or whatever.  Some may think the price is a bit spendy, but considering the size and quality of the food, I was happy with the cost.  I think for the 3 family members, we spent around $30 which isn't bad at all.  That includes our sodas.  I will be coming back to try some of the dinner options, burgers, and nachos at least.  I definetly recommend this place to anyone who might be in the area.  Also, just wanted to mention, it wasn't that busy when I was there.  Only 1-2 other groups of customers at any point while I was there."}
{"text":"My dining experience was good for the most part. Our waiter always checked on us to make sure if we needed anything. The ambiance is on the dark side, low lighting.  Decent prices on the menu."}
{"text":"The food was great here. I came around 3am and the food was pretty good quality. I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 because I wish the waitress was more attentive . She often disappeared to the back a lot"}
{"text":"Good Food!  Great Service~ did not know this place was a Cleveland Brown Bar on Football Sunday~ none the less~ the crowd was warm and fun as we entered the restaurant wearing our Steeler Shirts."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. But it always smells like crap in their. They need a new filter system cause the bar part stinks up the restaurant part. My wife Nd I never want to eat there because it smells like hell."}
{"text":"When I moved to Nevada I would stop here at least once a week for an order of liver and onions (which was amazing).  I would always get gravy on the liver until recently.  The restaurant started to charge $2.00 for gravy.  Who orders liver and onions without gravy??  I refused to be nickel and dim-ed! That being said tonight will be the last time I visit this restaurant..."}
{"text":"My go to spot on Sunday nights after work. Why Sunday's do you ask?  Because I did it once and wanted that feel good feeling every week that's why lol. But honestly a great spot to stop bye. The bartender is awesome, food is awesome and made in house from scratch, and everyone in there is a blast. Do yourself a favor and stop in and check it out."}
{"text":"This place is trying to bring in the breakfast crowd when I walked in it had the stench of old cigarette smell bar by night one half while the other half of the restaurant eatery by day. Not a good combination I could not stomach the idea of sitting through the whole breakfast meal. The whole group I was in of 7 decided we would look for another eating establishment."}
{"text":"Bartenders are super great... Video poker let's you play and the food is off the hook!!! Try the prime rib - as good as a fine dining restaurant - even the daily specials are better than most restaurants.  Can't go wrong.  Bartenders Brian and Andrew will take good care of you."}
{"text":"This place was amazing when I came here a year ago but it has changed. I would definitely still go here and it's a great place for a late night drink with friends.  The mac and cheese is excellent! It comes in a huge portion that's good for 2-3 people to share or plenty for you to take home. You can get it with jalapeno too! I would give it 4 stars but the -1 is because the prices have increased. The mac and cheese was taken off the very cheap late night menu!  The bartender is my absolute favorite. He is such a great, friendly guy and can make anybody feel like a regular here. He makes great mixed drinks and has good recommendations. He really knows his stuff and makes this bar a special place!"}
{"text":"No complaint here in this little hole in the wall joint! Even got good service here!"}
{"text":"4 stars for food, 4 stars for service, 2 stars for ambience/decor  Feeling lazy, we walked over to Henry's for some comfort food. Before we walked in there was a chalkboard listed with the daily specials: split pea soup and chicken stroganoff. Instantly, I felt like I was going to have dinner at some American's household. We walked in around 2pm and the restaurant section was completely empty. The bar section had a few of customers inside video gaming and drinking. (The bar and restaurant is sectioned off by a door. As soon as you enter, you are in the restaurant and you just need to open the door on the right to get to the bar.)  Pros:  We ordered fish & chips and club sandwich. The fish & chips came with cole slaw and for the club sandwich we got a side of pasta salad. The portions were huge; I'd say 4 people could have shared this meal. We liked the quality of the fish & chips because they used actual filets (and not mystery fish meat) and we liked the coat of crispy batter. The fries were decent, nothing remarkable. The club sandwich was a hit! They packed it in with real turkey meat (not turkey ham) and layers and layers of ham. All in all, it was a solid American lunch.   Kimberly was our waitress and she was really friendly and was great at her job. We ordered a diet coke and she brought a pitcher of it so we don't have to keep asking for refills. How convenient!  Open 24hrs!  Cons:  The decor is not welcoming or comforting at all. No real sunlight gets into the restaurant (windows are tinted), the booths are designed with tacky patterns, there are wine bottles held on these wirey frames (uhm...is it a wine tree?) and there are reminiscent 1920's-1930's bar pictures. And due to the adjacent bar, some of the cigarette smoke leaks into the restaurant. In my opinion, it'd be better to visit Henry's at night after a couple drinks.   BTW: It cost $0.40 extra to get a side of ranch! I don't mind the cost, but seriously?   Current promotions: Monday Pro-football Specials (3-10PM): $1 hot dogs, $1 coors light drafts Saturday & Sunday (9AM-6PM): $5 off any large pizza, $5 coors light pitchers (in house special only)  Photos:  I posted photos of the menu."}
{"text":"Food was great.. had the Bbq pizza and my mother had the regular 1/2 pound cheese burger.. we loved the food..   but we absolutely hated the service.. Nicole our waitress was dull and in a hurry.. we were 2 of 5 people in the building... She had no personality and zero helpfulness... great food.. just be careful to get Nicole.."}
{"text":"One of the best bar and grill in town! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu but I recommend my favorites...bleu cheese burger with extra sauce on the side, the hank, their wraps and of course their seasoned fries and malts!"}
{"text":"Yep!!! A 5 Star restaurant in a shopping mall.... Do not be deceived, the interior is industrial, super clean and a friendly waiter, he was the only one we saw!! We ate early on our way into Vegas for a show!! Glad we found them on Yelp. I ordered the Bleu cheese, mushroom burger and sweet potato puffs, this alone made me curious, the presentation was excellent and those puffs, phenomenal!!!! My hubby had the shrimp dinner, no complaints there either!! Our \" NEW\" favorite place to eat in Henderson, just so we can try everything on that extensive menu! Thanks for a great dining experience..... 5star for that attentive waiter.... As we left patrons were filling it up!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place zero stars but not an option. Family member has food allergy and when waiter (male who's tall, slender w/a handle bar mustache, brown thinning hair and brown eyes) was told of allergy to double check if oil cooked in was nut or canola, 2 cooks (one older white make medium build w/white hair cut short to scalp and balding in some spots and a rather over-weight large Asian male w/stupid laugh and a lot of predominant laugh lines) joked about using PN oil and when our waiter went back a 2nd time the cooks changed their mind that they misunderstood what the waiter previously said and said no we use canola oil. Ugh! Left us feeling u easy and why would you stay!? I went up to pay for drinks ordered and waiter said they're on the house for the misunderstanding. The balding white male chef said it wasn't me it was another chef who just left - what, to not get in trouble? Jerk! And as we were walking out our waiter said I never said he had a food allergy; defending co-workers...lame! #WillNotReturn"}
{"text":"Took a chance on this place and I'm glad we did! Excellent spot for a burger. Meat is juicy and fresh. Loved all the different toppings options. I ended up adding pineapple, guac and onions. Bun was light and toasted. All around great quality."}
{"text":"Came in because I live right next door and work grave shift... Anyways...   I was up on a Saturday night/Sunday morning (one of my days off) and decided to give this place a shot. I am quite happy about my decision. Henry's has exceptional specials, the food is excellent, and the staff is wonderful. I will be a wallflower at this establishment in the future.   BTW. Tommy the late night bartender is a solid dude.  Enjoy my friends"}
{"text":"Good food for a good price during the midnight special they're chicken Caesar salad was so good! Also keep in mind they're proportion is large especially the nachos!"}
{"text":"Lived in this area of Henderson for about 3 years now and have driven past Henry's many many times! I've always wanted to try them out but never made the attempt. My friend and I were at Costco the other night, and after a long shopping trip, were starving...plus all the sample carts were closing shop for the day :( .    He mentioned Henry's, I agreed, I had never been there, let's do it. We got there, and upon walking in it looks like a hole in the wall place...but honestly, hole in the wall places have the greatest portions of comfort food, which is very prevalent where I come from so it was fine by me!   The restaurant is on the left side, and there is a door to the bar on the right. Smoking is allowed in the bar, and there is gaming there as well.  It's on the small side but nice and quiet.  We asked for the menus, and my god....there is so much to choose from and it all looked super tasty!  Appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, prime rib sandwich! Dessert..omg! Bourbon bread pudding with a scoop of Thrifty ice cream!  YAY!  I ordered the BLT, and my friend had the club sandwich. We both had seasoned waffle fries.  The sandwich was perfect! His was huge!  He ate half and took the rest home for lunch! Not to mention the bar special is $1.50 bottles of Bud light Platinum for the rest of August! Killer deal! The food bill for both of us was $16.00, alcohol bill $13 for both of us. We're already planning a trip back there this weekend!"}
{"text":"For bar food this place is darn good!  Even tho I'm typically in here 3am-7am the food is always good!  I hate when places that are 24 hours have a bad graveyard cook!  Well not a problem here!  I've ordered the BBQ chicken pizza quite a few times and it's good!!  The mozzarella sticks are good but I wasn't loving the marinara sauce..  I ordered the chicken quesadilla last night and it was packed full of chicken beans cheese and veggies!!  I love the grave bartender!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different for our Friday night out, and this was proximity and had some decent reviews. So who can say no to a place that has waffle cut fries on the menu? In we went. On a side note my gps told me it was on the wrong side of the road, so if you are starting and not seeing it anywhere..It's on the west side of the street.  Anyway. We were promptly greeted by a server who was very friendly. The menu is huge, which I love and hate. I was the kid that was so torn between choosing between candy choices as a kid that my mom would actually have to do a countdown for me and it ALWAYS was a last minute selection.... and I still.have that problem. Anyway. I got the... crap.. It's the brisket sandwich on focaccia with roasted peppers, sports, gouda, horseradish.. Ugh my memory. My husband got the German burger and even though.we did not need it, we got  order of the habenero hamburger Mac and cheese.. when in Rome.   Food was prompt. I live that we got mini pitchers of our drinks. So much easier. Those were refilled And I never faced an empty glass while needing to cool down my fiery habenero mouth.  My sandwich was delicious. A great flavor combo and I was thankful for having unique menu options too choose from. I hate having to choose between a cheeseburger, chicken fingers, and a club. Boring. The only complaint I had was by the time I.Got to the end it was a little soft and started to fall apart on hand.  The Mac was delightful. Definitely NOT shy on the habeneros. Definite heat. We.live on spicy food (like I go.through more cayenne than any spice in my.cabinet..salt included)   Hubbys burger was oddly good too. I really.worried because it arrived in all of its messy topping glory, which I.knew my husband would have no patience for one it started to.squish out the sides and fall apart. Shockingly, it didn't. Amazing! I'm not  kraut fan at all but.I.sampled a bite.and the flavors all worked together.   The prices are decent. You.get plenty of food and it is very good. I'm.glad we tried something new and am happy to add it to the rotation.  So, for some good tasty food with excellent friendly service give it a whirl."}
{"text":"The owner has serious issues, he doesn't want people sitting at machines even when there are only one or two gamblers in the whole place. The 2 swing bartenders are great but without them I'm pretty sure the place would close. You can order food but the owner decides how it is cooked!?! That's just crazy.... there are too many other places to go to put up with this."}
{"text":"We are regulars here. Everything we walk in the place is virtually empty at peak hours and I don't don't why. Kristen's the best server ever. She's chatty but in a good way... She reminds me of a throw-back classic gal who's helpful and enthusiastic about your dining experience. I order the patty melt a lot and it's perfect! Best I've ever had. We've tried the Mac and cheese which DOES NOT disappoint! Have to try it with bacon and chicken next time.   Food is always consistently good, served hot and very fresh. All meats are ground/smoked/cured on the premises.   My husband, a former long-haul truck driver has had ham and eggs all over the U.S., declared their hamsteak and eggs the best he's ever had. The ham is as big as the plate, grilled and juicy!   Henry's is definitely our go-to neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and tasty food. Decided on the midnight special, cheese burger and sweet potato fries. Really good bargain too. Cooked to perfection The signature dessert, Whiskey bread pudding was the icing on cake or ice cream Giving this place 10/10. Must try if your in Henderson."}
{"text":"Maybe I picked the wrong night? I live close by and thought I would try this spot for some wings. Service was kind of slow, which was odd cause it was nor very crowded. However the waitress was really nice and the place was clean. I decided I go with the garlic Parmesan wings, because those are usually amazing. I got my wings and was dissatisfied, there was no sauce or seasoning. The wings were breaded and cooked just right but had no flavor. Might need to stop by again to give them another chance."}
{"text":"I have always seen Henry's while driving along Stephanie but haven't ever tried it.  The other day I ordered some food for my staff on Uber eats and picked Henry's because it was the closest and fastest... we were starving.  Their menu has some items that are a little out of the box... like the cheeseburger pizza.  We ordered that and it was BOMB!  We also ordered the crispy chicken salad with apples and raisins.  It was phenomenal.  Yesterday I ordered some burgers and they were outstanding... really really really good.  All their food has been A+.! I can't believe we haven't tried this place out before.  I assumed it was going to be typical bar food but their food is far from typical.  The prices are reasonable and more than fair.  Excellent quality!"}
{"text":"It was ok. Not clear why everyone is so obsessed with this place? Maybe it's one of those places that really depends on what you order. I kept it basic with an avocado grilled cheese and waffle fries and my dinner date got some fancy burger. Both were aight just not amazing. We were the only people there at 6pm which is prime dinner time. I would give this place another try and pick a better dish to give it a shot since everyone seems to drool over this place in reviews. It has a small town cottage vibe like you stopped into a diner on Route 66. A-OK."}
{"text":"Henry's  closes their dining room at 11pm. Bar side is open all night. Food is comfort stuff. So that's not so bad. the cook was not attentive and over cooked our steaks by a degree. with only four levels of cooking this is pretty bad.  Tasty shoe leather went down  better than you'd assume due to proper seasoning. Over all not pleased. Wait staff was courteous and attentive to our party of four + 1/2 so at least our visit late friday night was pleasant.   Be careful on meat orders and do not ask for medium. the cook does not know what that means. He prefers rare, med rare, med well or burn-it for cooking desire."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the burgers and milkshakes are the best. I would like to try out the bar in the restaurant someday too. I'd definitely recommend this place to someone who hasn't tried this restaurant out before and if definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Went on a Sunday night, extremely empty but the waitress was kind enough to show us how big the portions were. I ordered the full portion of Mac and cheese and they accidentally gave me the half but the cook did not hesitate to make the second half and own up to his mistake. Definitely will come back again! Lots of options to choose from"}
{"text":"I always enjoy my meal at Henry's. Not a lot of people even know that it's there, so it is almost like a hidden gem. My girlfriend usually hates eating at bars but Henry's has their own separate dining area away from the bar and she loves their food. It's a great place to watch sports too."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy the idea of being transported to the early 1990's to enjoy mediocre food in the ambiance comparable to a tacky motel? This is the place for you! Sorry,  Henry's. I wanted to love you. But I can't lie. I'm mourning the loss of my evening and my $77 dollars."}
{"text":"Every meal I've had and Henry's has been amazing the wait staff is very friendly. If you are in the area, you won't go wrong having a meal"}
{"text":"I can't give a place five stars that doesn't serve anything unique and off the chart, but this place is as close as it gets for a grill.    All the sandwiches are good traditional American diner style.    They bring you a mini pitcher of your drink so you don't have to wait on refills.  If you are in the area around the Galleria Mall or DMV, this is a nice meal stop. The club and \"Hank\" sandwiches are solid, and you will need a to-go box.  They have $8 shakes, which had me thinking of Pulp Fiction.  My daughter loved her's.    I thought the sweet potato tots were the best I have ever had.  Often, these can be soggy.  Not here."}
{"text":"Great food and fast/friendly service.  Had the mushroom bleu cheese burger.  Will definitely be back for that again!"}
{"text":"I took family there for dinner because of their overall solid 4 star review.  IMO the $21 steaks were inconsistent and not worth the money.  They may be great at other things but this was a complete whiff as far as Yelp ratings go."}
{"text":"When I think of Las Vegas, visions of the 1970s mafia Vegas come to mind. Over on the Strip, those days are long gone but you'll be swept back in time when you walk in the door at Henry's. Degenerates pumping a paycheck into video poker at the bar and smokers hazing up the room set the atmosphere of days long gone.  Decently prepared food and cheap drinks make it worth the visit bring some more practical reasons to visit. If you're in Henderson and it is late night, your dining options are not just limited to Del Taco. Come to Henry's, take in the locals putting on a show (even if they don't realize that they are the show) and have a better meal."}
{"text":"It's your average bar food / nothing special but if you need a quick bite and want bottomless soda this is your joint."}
{"text":"Great place to eat breakfast and/or dinner.   Staff is friendly and attentive.  Menu has many delicious choices. Loved the steak sandwich (the Hank). Fries are good, buffalo wings are tasty and the corned beef hash breakfast plate is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Monday night with no ideas for dinner so we decided to eat out. We want d something quick but different. Came across this gem through yelp! As soon as we walked in we were greeted and told to sit where ever we'd like. The place is a bar and a restaurant. What I really liked about it this place is that the dining area and bar area are completely separate.   Walking into the bar area you do get a big whif of cigarettes. You can also dine in the bar area but we decided to be away from the cigarette smell and dined in the dining area.   I ordered the southwestern burger and my husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  A M A Z I N G !!!   Make sure you come with an appetite because the portion size is pretty big .  Both meals had lots of yummy flavors and some spice to it.  My burger was filled with pepper, jalapeños, cheese onions and everything yummy! My husband loved his meal too. I loved that they filled is sand which with lots of pulled pork. They weren't greedy with that at all.  Will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Not the fanciest of places, but has everything you need in all the right places... Service & food!! Our waitress Christin was very nice & attentive. The food can out hot, fast and very flavorful. Menu had plenty to choose from, I look forward to going back & trying different things."}
{"text":"Came in here after a four hour hike because I was craving a nice big salad. I ordered a house salad and a Chicken Cesar Warp. It was my first time ordering a wrap from a restaurant, it was pretty delicious I must say. The portions were nice sized and the service as decent. My one complaint is the deep fryer was down therefore I did not get to try their onion rings oh and the ranch could have been better. Other than that their prices were reasonable. I would definitely go back especially on a game night. They have really good foond and specials on game nights."}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem in Henderson.   Been going there for years and have never been disappointed with the food.  Even though they are attached to a bar the food they serve is far, far away from bar food.  Great selection and quality."}
{"text":"Beers are overpriced and the grave bartender rather serve food than take care of gamblers and beer drinkers. Tom is a rookie. He sucks at managing a bar and does not want to serve alcohol. I believe he enjoys Serving food to regulars more than make shots or pour liquor. It turns out we were paying 4.75 for a pint of beer even while gambling. Somehow I get a feeling he likes to hook up only his regulars. Won't be headed back anytime soon. This is kind of sad too because it's so close to home. If you are a beer drinker and like to get good service from a bartender skip this place because it's just not going to happen. This review is based on at least 4 visits to this bar and it only reflects the service we had from Tom the grave yard waiter."}
{"text":"Every time we go to Henry's I fall in love with it all over again.   Best Bleu Cheese Burger in Vegas. It's not just a little bit of bleu cheese throw onto a burger. There's bleu cheese mixed with happiness to create an amazing cream sauce concoction that makes my heart ache with every bite. If only I could make a bleu cheese sauce that delicious. They also have a Farm Burger and Nacho Burger that put my boyfriend down for the happy food coma coma. Good quality ingredients in a solid bun that somehow keeps up with all the messiness.  Their Garlic and Rosemary Chicken is fantastic. Tender, never overcooked, savory and filling in every way possible. The mashed potatoes on the side are mediocre, but who needs potatoes when there's a scrumptious chicken to devour?  Henry's is a 24 hour restaurant, and they have a GREAT late night menu. Everything is $5 and the best bang for your buck. The late night cheeseburger is equally delicious after 12AM. They have the standards, 2 eggs, hash browns and toast, but the star of this menu is the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. The smells of this sandwich followed me to the restaurant when it was in front of my boyfriend in the bar section. Great sauce, tender pork, great seasoning. It comes with plenty of fries that are crispy, well seasoned and not disappointing in any way.  To top it all off, they have mini-desserts, including a hot fudge sundae that proves sometimes you need a little sweetness at the end of every meal.  Definitely stop by here for a quick bite. Even though not everything on the menu is as good as the next, overall this restaurant has great quality for a perfect price. Top it off with consistently fantastic service and you've got a deal."}
{"text":"Had no clue about this gem. Customer service is great! They want you happy. You don't just get your food and a bill. I hate that! 2 choices, Bar side and restaurant side. Both good! Yummy food"}
{"text":"Kacy T. & Terry M. are certainly smoking some serious crack (Especially if your ordering your child under 2 a freakin' hamburger). Anyway... we found this place a few weeks back and it's definitely a hidden gem. The Farmer burger is great with the Sweet Potato Tots, the Patty Melt, Nacho burger, Club Sandwich and Ruben are awesome too! The price is completely fair, it's very clean and it's a great place to bring the family."}
{"text":"It was Yelp, Shirley B., and Vegas J. who got me here and they won't even realize it unless they read this. The reviews, tips, and pics had me sold before we were even there. My only main question is this- how the hell did I not know about a 24/7 spot, that's close to my house, that me and my bf can eat salads and appetizers and entrees for $34?!!??! All together we ordered: 2 sodas, a nachos app, a gravy fries app, a 1/2 size house salad, 1/2 size POTW (pasta of the week), and a nacho burger.  Originally we ordered the gravy fries along side the burger, but she brought out a whole order. We weren't complaining, especially when it wasn't any extra on our tab! The house salad was good. Fresh with yummy dressing. The nachos were bomb. I love good nachos and these had chili and cheese with sour cream and green onions then a side of jalapeños and salsa that went great with it. The POTW was chicken curry with mushrooms and onions. This was the only thing I wouldn't order again. Not that it was bad, the chicken was cooked right and the veggies were good. It was just bland. It lacked the flavor you expect from anything with curry in the title. My bf devoured his nacho burger, it had cheese oozing out the side that went on his fries. (Who doesn't like cheesy fries) so yes he has cheesy fries and gravy fries, don't judge.  My only negative observation was they seemed understaffed. I watched all of my food sit in the window for 1-3 minutes before being served to me. All the while there was a second waitress who looked like she wanted nothing to do with the other one, nor her tables as she wouldn't even make eye contact with us. Our waitress, (Kimberly was the name on the ticket) was still great and even apologized for being so rushed.  Overall I had a good experience and can't wait to return to try the mushroom blue cheese burger. And probably many other things as well.  Thanks Shirley B. and Vegas J.  Shirley and I are already known for running into each other randomly so maybe I will see you guys there one day!"}
{"text":"Go here, for their delicious cheese burger. Came here last night and the food was fresh and delicious. We ordered burger and fries and everything came out perfect. This burger is one of the best I've ever had. It was cooked properly, fresh with everything I wanted. I highly recommend this place to everyone.   Just a warning, the place is not fancy looking. Just a good hole in a wall type of restaurant. If you want something simple and fast, and you want burger and fries.... then I recommend that you come here. It's worth it. The best part, the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, our server was very pleasant and attentive. But best of all the food was amazing. I had the Hank with waffle fries, and my wife had the turkey wrap with sweet potato puffs. I am so happy we tried this place. We would never have found it just driving around."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and I still love it! The late night menu is so affordable and the service is great! Thomas is amazing!"}
{"text":"The service here is excellent!  And so are the burgers and fries.  Safe to say the best burger in town.  Their plain burgers and cheeseburgers are awesome, but the blue cheese burger tops them all.   Fries are hot, crisp  and plenty of them.   Give this one a try for a casual, inexpensive and satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Love their Graveyard Specials & Tom the server was the coolest dude!. Food was delicious. Love their Fries!"}
{"text":"I frequent Henry's when I know I'm hungry enough to eat a GINORMOUS portion.  Touted as an American grill, they certainly have a lot to choose from. Pizzas, burgers and sandwiches are among the many, many menu choices. I had the Honey Fried Chicken salad with sliced apples and toasted almonds on my last visit. I know this isn't a NEW concept for a dinner salad, but I did enjoy that the breading on the chicken had a sweet honey flavor. It really went well with the honey mustard dressing.  All fountain drinks that you order always end up coming with a small pitcher on the side that will probably fill your drink two more times. Some would call this a lazy practice so the wait staff doesn't have to refill drinks, I think of it as a thoughtful touch.  They also have an extensive breakfast menu. I've only had the corned beef hash, which was delicious and plentiful.   They have a sports bar feel going on, as there are a few TV's situated around with sports playing. I wouldn't say it isn't kid friendly at all.  Bottom line, reasonable prices, HUGE portions, great variety and good staff. I'd recommend Henry's for a causal meal with friends."}
{"text":"The bar is next door-- never been there. The restaurant is never full, has great service, and fantastic food.  Steaks and burgers are wonderful as is the honey chicken salad."}
{"text":"What I like most about Henry's is that it is never too crowded. The times that we have been have been at dinner, close to peak dinner times, it has never been crowded. I like a place that you know you can go to and just have a quiet meal and a conversation. Henry's is that place. There is a good variety of tasty food and the staff is at your table just enough to take care of your needs, without being overbearing.  The bar is next to the restaurant, but it is separated by glass and doors. On the way out I did catch a whiff of cigar smoke from the bar, but it wasn't near the booths where we were eating.   Enjoy! When you are looking for a quiet meal with grown-ups."}
{"text":"We came in late one night to try them out. I was not disappointed at all. The staff was very friendly and the cook even came to check on us. The meals, oh my, they were so so good! Because we came in late we were able to order for the graveyard menu. The prices were really cheap; $2-$7 in range I think. Don't let the price fool you though. They gave us a huge serving! It was really tasty, too! I'd definitely come back to try some more."}
{"text":"Wow. I work nearby and haven't been back to Henry's for at least a year because of a temporary job assignment that took me out of the area for a time. What a difference a year makes! Always enjoyed lunch here because the service was quick, the food excellent and the staff friendly. While our waiter was very nice and efficient - how can a place go downhill so fast? I was warned by my fellow employees (we have over 100) that it wasn't the same. An understatement. The 1/2 lb. burger was always large with 2 patties and a great bun. The one I received for lunch last week was much smaller and looked smushed. And the cheese!?!?!? I guess it was cheese. Ordered cheddar but what was on my burger looked liked some kind of secret sauce. (And I don't want to know what the 'secret' is). It was like an orange wet spread. My wife told me that they were using 'cheap' cheese and that's why it 'melted' like it did (more like 'liquified'). SO DISAPPOINTED! How can a place like this stay open? Is it under new ownership? Management? The food was always like homemade. Their special St Patrick's Day offering was always incredible but I can't bring myself to return again. So sad. You would think with the fabulous METRO DINER as a next door neighbor, Henry's would actually stay on their toes. Amazing."}
{"text":"Good food in LARGE portions. Friendly staff and good service. I really like their Mac n cheese and they're open 24/7. restaurant and bar is separated. Family friendly. I'm looking forward on trying more of the food."}
{"text":"The gaming and bar are separate from the dining room. The menu is large and varied. We had a burger and clam strips and both were good. The Henry sauce is just the right touch of tang and spice and the clam strips were flavorful. The waitress was very friendly and sweet."}
{"text":"Dont order \"jasmine rice\" as a side, its a cheap rice and the cook donst even know how to wash the rice...horable lunch dammit!"}
{"text":"Yesterday about 3 in the afternoon the wife and I went in for a late lunch since I had to go to work in a hour or so. I open the door and it's heavy like it's spring loaded, we step in and sure enough the door slams behind us with a loud bang! Ooops I thought and I see the waitress cleaning the booths on the far wall, even with that loud booming door slam she didn't even acknowledge us, back turned to us and not even any eye contact or \"hello, I'll be with you in a moment\"  We take a table and still no welcome what so ever. We are both looking at her and she goes on wiping tables and not a glance our way. She is actually cleaning the rest of the booths and continues to ignore us. My wife says, \"lets get out of here\" and I thought so too, but I needed to eat before I went to work and so we stayed. I had to yell out, \"could we get a couple menus?\" and the waitress was really unwelcoming and cold. I am like, what in the world is she doing serving tables? Maybe she is working two jobs and is really burned out or someone pissed her off recently? but we are the only ones in the place.  As we looked over the menu some other people came in and she again acted like she didn't want to serve anybody. I've had better service at Carls Jr. and if they weren't a few miles away we would have went there instead. The burgers were good and a 1/2 pound double was too much for our appetites. Fries were excellent and the cook with the black cap back there is doing a great job on the food. The waitress circled our table a few times, but never spoke to us to ask how everything was luckily my wife somehow got a refill on her drink. When she circled around us, I asked for our check and she was grovelling to herself and replied back like, \"I\"LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU AS SOON AS I COME BACK\"  We left a few dollars tip and with that cold treatment from the waitress we over tipped in our opinion. People like that should not be serving food, we liked the food, but will never be back considering the unfriendly waitress."}
{"text":"The beans in the salad were mushy and as soon as I opened the salad it smelled like something was rotting. I then smelled around and realized it was the beans. I called the place to find out when the beans expire and he said they were made on Wednesday(it's Sunday today) and they usually don't toss them yet. I told him the taste of the beans were bad and the smell was pretty powerful. He said \"well we can't do much about that maybe talk to uber\". And proceeded to hang up. Everything els was pretty good. But now hesitated. Not knowing how long the food really sits there. Gross. I didn't even try to eat the salad since the smell was horrible. Waste of food and money and the action they took was horrible."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Savannah burger, the bunker hill sandwich and meatball sub all very good and exceeded expectations. I will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 2 times before. The food is decent, but the portions are good sized so you feel you get value for your money. But yesterday was a different story. My rueben sandwich was 1/4 the size of anywhere else. Mostly though? The service was the main problem. Our waitress, Alicia, was great. The cooks on the other hand were terrible . My guest is a type 1 diabetic and had just taken her injection right before we entered. She has to eat soon after her shot. I was recovering from a fractured pelvic bone, so sitting in one spot is painful. My 3rd guest was my friends husband. We had to wait over 30 minutes for a hamburger, a reuben and an omelette. Our waitress asked the cooks 2 times for our order. I watched her get berated for her efforts. Later. I complained to Dina, the bartender, an  asst. Manager? And she pretended to listen. I won't go back again. If you have any health issues and need to eat in a timely fashion? Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"It's not often I say this but if I could give a 6 star rating to Henry's I would. Everything here was superb. From the fries, to the Mac and cheese, the shakes, the chicken fingers, the selection, the service, and the overall atmosphere, this became an instant new found favorite. Previously I thought Chicken Shack had by far the best Chicken Fingers here in Henderson but Henry's beat that by far. The fingers were large and plenty fresh and juicy. I highly recommend getting the Garlic Parmesan on them. The Chocolate shake there was also fantastic! Plus our server Kristen made the experience great. We came during prime lunch hours and the place was virtually empty. Service was quick and the variety on the menu was fantastic. I will be returning here time and time again."}
{"text":"Our server Daniel was absolutely amazing!! He was very attentive to our needs and we will definitely be back and requesting him! Usually at restaurants the fries are able to be eaten immediately as they're warm and clearly sitting in the window for a minute or two.. I had to wait a few minutes to eat mine, he brought everything out the second it was done. Thanks Daniel!!!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a great Burger or sandwich this is the place to go.   Bread pudding was delicious."}
{"text":"Yummy ribeye steak sandwich. Cooked perfectly and super tender. Service was on point as well"}
{"text":"ALERT  They changed their burgers in June 2012!  Reviews prior to that date are not the burger you will be served!"}
{"text":"Had a late night and found this place still open for some late night grub. The 2AM burger was just what we needed and Man it was delicious,  the fries were awesome too.  Friendly bar tender. Played a little poker at the bar and got our drinks on the house too. Best priced burgers in town!"}
{"text":"Bangin chicken pesto sandwich, with sweet potato tots. The reuben sand was perfect, nothing beats corned beef from scratch...Great service from Kat... thx!"}
{"text":"Ordered two cheese steaks but instead I got prime rib sandwiches that were inedible.  Asked for sourdough bread, expecting a roll, and instead I got toasted sliced bread.  The meat was hard and disgusting, do they really expect people to eat this.    So they got my order 100% wrong, and the food I got was bad, can't do much worse than that."}
{"text":"My first time there, took food to go and  the food was awesome!  I have to come back and try their famous prime rib and the bar it's next door... Yeah!!  Amazing can't wait to go back with my husband  Just pls!! Pls!! Treat your chef good so he doesn't quit before I get used to your restaurant flavor. Thank you!"}
{"text":"While it's true that there are soooo many restaurants in Henderson my gf and I agree.....Henry's is goooood! Great service by Miles, our waiter.  No complaints about the food either.  I  had the pulled pork and my gf had pancakes loaded with lucious bananas even though she was REALLY lusting for their mac and cheese. So naturally we will be coming back. Miles was more than accommodating!  Definitely a good \"go to\" local eatery that's comfy, non pretentious with good simple dishes!"}
{"text":"Oh yum! Diner food at its best! Delicious burgers, crispy waffle fries, light and fluffy sweet potato puffs. We will be back to try the malt which our server assures us is the real deal. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The place looks a bit iffy from outside and the fact that there was only one other person in the dining room when I first walked in made me question the positive reviews on Yelp.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed my German burger (Two patties, corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and 1000 Island dressing on a burger? Genius!), sweet potato puffs (also known as ambrosia!), and warm whiskey bread pudding. The only downside? WNBA playoffs on the TV.  I travel to the Las Vegas area for one week every three months and will definitely swing bye once or twice during each trip!"}
{"text":"Pretty good menu selection and food for a neighborhood bar. I had a great steak here for under $20 bucks. I think it was better then ones I get on the strip for $60."}
{"text":"Worst ever.  The kitchen was a disaster.  By the end of our meal, 4 of us, all served at different times and then half the food wasn't even right,  the server just said, \"Screw it, it's on me. I'm walking out anyway.\""}
{"text":"The service here is almost always friendly & enjoyable.  Quick! The food is LITERALLY my favorite EVER.  BEST grilled cheese.  This place deserves more business absolutely.  Check it out.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night about 6:30. Sat right down and got our menus.  6 of us.  Waiter forgot a few things and then when one of my buddies told him the meatball was disgusting he just said sorry.  He even asked if he could get some fries to make up for it and was told he would get charged for a side.   Their fries are awesome. The blt was okay.  Service was sub par and won't be back.   The meatballs were pretty hard.  I posted a pic of them.  You can see where they are pretty dry. I wouldn't waste your time"}
{"text":"Came back for my first dine in visit, Miles is an outstanding server. He knows the menu really well, and is professional and personable. The fried pickles were great but could have been drained more , I understand fried can be greasy but the plate was super greasy.. prime rib sandwich was great and my mom said her cobb salad was good.. we will definitely be back and hopefully Miles will be our server again"}
{"text":"Good service. We had the pork chops, ziti, and the prime rib sandwich. The only reason one less star is because you can only get an actual prime rib dinner on Thursdays :("}
{"text":"This is a 24-hour spot with a ridiculous happy hour starting after midnight. The quality of their food is incredible given it's a poker bar that is smoky as all hell.   I recently snagged a Turkey Club at 2am on a Monday. It came with sweet potato tater tots. I couldn't believe how fresh the turkey was; it was carved (seemingly fresh) and NOT processed. The sweet potato tots tasted fresh, too -- not from a larger food service distributor.   The bar is smoky and the service can be a little slow. It's definitely a place for regulars. That said, you can call in a take-out order 24 hours a day and get a truly quality meal.   As far as I'm concerned: Henry's is a gem.   (Note: If you're a video poker player, their pay tables are not ideal. However, I imagine that's where the great happy hour, and reasonable prices come into play)"}
{"text":"Ok...chicken fried steak and eggs and biscuits and gravy are awesome...even at 1 a.m.  ...just got outta the Emergency room... And hadn't eaten all day...this is awesome...great flavor"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for lunch after seeing reviews. They advertised a 4.99 burger. I got mine with blue cheese and bacon, medium well. Fries were extra. When the burger arrived it was substantial. I've never been unable to finish a single burer but  this was huge and the fries were plentiful also. The burger itself was perfectly cooked and the bacon and bleu cheese were very nice. Much better that the new chain burgers places. The place is very small and quiet. I have been back by myself and with co-workers. All the portions have been huge. Cobb salad is excellent also."}
{"text":"Gets burst size of head with fresh avocado which was amazing. We all loved our meal and only one of us finished (it was salad). They had great food and a nice atmosphere in the cosmo. Would recommend keep it up team."}
{"text":"The Savannah Burger is Delicious! The waitress, Nicole, was very Attentive and Friendly. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Such a nice little neighborhood restaurant. We've passed by hundreds of times and never really noticed it but we wanted something different and it came up with great reviews on yelp. We got the Mac n cheese for our daughters to share and it was  super cheesy and delicious. Since it was raining I wanted something warm so I ordered the pot roast and my hubby got chicken fried steak. Mine was a huge portion of tender pot roast with a delicious gravy and potatoes and carrots. The chicken fried steak was really good too! The prices can't be beat and our waitress (Kimberley I think?) was just so incredibly sweet. She brought out pitchers of iced tea so we never ran out of drinks, brought a to go cup of lemonade for my daughter and just had an awesome personality. Great service can make or break a restaurant and she really made it that much better. Perfect little spot for a nice, inexpensive and tasty dinner. They need to advertise more because I'm sure a lot of people have no idea what they're missing!"}
{"text":"Good  bar food for cheap and they have late night specials after midnight. That about Somes up Henrys."}
{"text":"Always love going here with my girlfriend and the staff is great. Kim and Kali are a great waitstaff. They have a great selection of lunch and dinner options. Great bar selection and fantastic prices. Perfect neighborhood grill and bar."}
{"text":"First time here and I can already say I love it here. Great service from the waitress. ( I'll get her name before I leave.) Clam chowder from scratch is so bomb! The place smells so clean and fresh and doesn't smell like food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's a total dive bar, but it gives it character. I used to come here a few years ago for the graveyard menu. The prices are so low but the food has always been so good. The bartender back then was really nice.   I just came back for the first time in two years and fell in love all over again. This time we got to try the Savannah burger, worlds best (hamburger habanero) mac and cheese, chips and salsa, and waffle fries. The food blew us away, especially the mac and cheese. For it being such a small little dive bar than goes unnoticed- the food is superb. We highly recommend the mac and cheese. Probably the best we've had (hence the name \"worlds best\".   The service was also amazing. Our server Amberlyn (I'm pretty sure that's it) was so genuinely nice, timely, and made great recommendations.   This will probably be one of our new favorite local spots since we live in the area."}
{"text":"We love Henry's! Everything I've had is delicious. I especially love the sweet potato tots. My husband always gets their chicken fingers, he loves them!"}
{"text":"The story will take a while, so bear with me. Or just scroll to the bottom.  After a nice long afternoon and evening slumber and a few TV episodes, I was pretty famished. It was well past midnight, and I had just the place in mind: Henry's.  Upon entering the anteroom, I saw the sign to hit the doorbell if the inner door was locked, so I did that and smiled for the camera (look up and to the right). The door clicked and I walked in. I saw the restaurant to the left and a bar to the right, where seemingly everybody was. Since I didn't feel like eating my food through the stench of cigarette smoke, I sat on the restaurant side.  The late night menu was exciting to see. Available from midnight until 7am, it offers a decent array of options including a couple breakfast options, some nachos, salads, and soup. I was destined to get the burger, however, and opted for the $1.99 hamburger. Couldn't justify adding $1 for a $2.99 cheeseburger, even if it would have been that much yummier. Also got the crunchy fries for $1 and added an \"appetizer\" of two garlic parm chicken fingers, learning later that it's actually $1.00 for each finger even though the menu says to order by twos.  I was still a little hazy with the passage of time and such, but it probably took 10-15 minutes. For all I cared, it could've taken half an hour and I wouldn't have been too concerned, given a prior experience at a late night place. It just so happened that one moment I was looking at my phone, and the next I saw three red plastic trays on the counter at the kitchen. The cook soon asked me if those were my items, given that the only other guy was still in the bar. I indicated as such and he brought the trays out to me.  FOOD! Oh yes, I had waited for this, and I was ready to enjoy it. I grabbed a chicken finger first, and I noticed it was still hot, and oh so greasy. A little too greasy. I later saw a huge pool of oil at the bottom of the paper and got just a little freaked out. I think the fingers were a little overdone, but they were still pretty good. The complementary ranch definitely helped out. Grease aside, there's so much meat here for $1 that you'd be doing yourself a disservice going anywhere else during these hours.  The burger was a treat. There's lettuce, grilled onions, tomato, slightly too many pickle slices, and a special sauce that I couldn't tell you much about except that it was delicious. The burger was well done, but you can't win every single time I guess. I just have no idea how you're going to beat this value for $1.99.  The fries were also ridiculously good. They're cut pretty thick, floured a bit, and reportedly brined before frying, and they were just super fluffy and maintained that outer crunch throughout the night. And they sure lasted that long since the order is so dang huge! You can easily share this between 2 or even 3 people, but I braved the pile as a loner. They actually held up flavor-wise too until the last handful, where I finally asked the cook for the ketchup. Probably should've asked for the ketchup even earlier, but I was too stubborn.  I've only eaten out a few times after midnight, but it still shouldn't have taken years for me to visit this place. Henry's was one of those places that I'd heard about for a little while but hadn't bothered to visit. Now, it's one of those places that I'd love to visit again and again if I'm ever awake at the proper time."}
{"text":"Best chicken fried steak I've ever had! A little bit greasy but so flavorful! The bf had corned beef hash and was also delicious! Staff were very friendly even at 4 in the morning. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It's a little dark as expected for a restaurant connected to a Bar. Service is super nice and the menu has something for a crowd. We chose the recommended Chicken Fried Steak and the Fish n Chips with waffle fries for extra charge. The Chicken Fried Steak, hands down. The Fish n Chips were perfectly cooked as well. Looking forward to Thursdays Prime Rib night and to try many more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Little local place. The interior needs a serious update but other than that it's pretty good. Good service, friendly staff. I ordered the 1/4 lb hamburger it's like eating a homemade burger, very simple and that's why I enjoyed it. I ordered it with a side of waffle fries, oil tasted clean it was almost like it was double fried, I couldn't eat em all but they were good. He bf ordered the fried shrimp, again oil tasted clean came with fries and cocktail sauce, he liked it."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love this place. The staff are on top of things and very pleasant. We go here often. The place is always clean. We went again tonight for one of the the New years specials, Filet with  potato choice, asparagus garlic bread and salad. We also had Creme brulee to finish our evening. All I can say is to die for! We would easily pay hundreds of dollars elsewhere at a high end restaurant and not have the comfort and affordability that this place offers.  Thank you to Frank the head chef and the other cooks for fantastic food and to our waitress Kim she always has a smile on her face as do the other servers there. Happy New Years. and cheers to seeing you in 2015!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but nothing outstanding. My husband had chicken fingers which were marinated in a really tasty citrus sauce but my son got a children's burger that was cooked med rare at most - this wouldn't be a problem if it was for me but my son is not quite 2 years old yet and we generally feed him his meat prepared well done. Would only go back if its late and everything else was closed. Service was what was expected for a bar with attached restaurant. Definitely not a good spot to go with your family - unfortunately i learned the the hard way."}
{"text":"I love this place..fries, fish n chips, veggie wrap, pizza, my husband loves their comfort food dishes, we are going back every Thanksgiving. .. very good!"}
{"text":"Called in an order, picked it up at the bar. Easy in, easy out. Got a delicious burger for the wife, fish and chips for myself, and Mac and cheese for the kid who absolutely loved it. What more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"We heard a lot of positive comments about Henry's, so we had to try it for ourselves... Really glad we did, too. We had 5 in our group, and our dinners ran from a burger to the liver & onion dinner. Everyone in our group, had a great meal, and the food seemed to disappear off the plates. I had the Liver & Onion dinner, with mashed and veggies. It was cooked perfectly, nice and tender, too. A real tasty comfort food. My wife had the pasta special, blackened chicken Alfredo, which she really enjoyed. We also had the bread pudding for desert... Which is a must try.  Our server was fast, professional & friendly.  Dinner was great, so we'll have to stop by for breakfast now!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! I guess that's a good way to start this review.   So, I'm out in Hendo doing some shopping and  was getting a bit hungry.   I had heard some good words about Henry's from a guy at work so I figured I'd track it down.   I'm my opinion it's a bit hard to spot because it's located in a shopping plaza and the only signage is on the doors (at least what I could see). You have to know what you're looking for to spot it.  One side is a bar (with machines) which is closed off from the restaurant side.   I did my eating in the restaurant.   Very spacious and clean with four tvs to keep you busy.   The staff (Kimmy) was very pleasant and very helpful with the menu.  Additionally,  I ordered iced tea and not only did she bring me a full glass, she brought a mini pitcher full as well  The pizza,  bbq, and burgers get good reviews so I decided to go burger today.   The Farm Burger to be exact.   Sweet 6lb Baby Jesus, how big should a burger be?!  Two beef patties, fried egg, bacon, plus the normal veggies with  a side of slaw.   Very  very tasty!!  And not crazy expensive.   I think I rounded out at around $12.  I decided to write my review while I'm in the restaurant, cuz I can't move at the moment  Try it,  you'll love it."}
{"text":"From the outside Henry's doesn't seem to belong where it is. It's not a standalone establishment, which threw me off a little bit because the outside doesn't match the inside in a way.  In fact I pass by this place every day, and honestly haven't even given it a second glance until I ate there for breakfast with some friends. I was very surprised by the openness of the place, the portion of my meal and the quality of the food.   For me, I like mom and pop places, non-corporate and non chain food places.  I like to eat at places that are different so that when people come to town, we aren't always going to Denny's, I-hop, Olive Garden etc.  That so happened to be the case when my family visited and wanted to eat somewhere new.  I took them to Henry's and my brother commented that this was just the place he was looking for.  Good comfort food, great quality and great value.  I had a HAHA moment when we ordered french fries, and our server said they don't serve french fries. because being an \"American Grill\" there is no such thing.  Instead, they offer freedom fries...see HAHA.  8-)  Quick tip/tidbit of info - it's open 24 hours a day, and they offer free mints at the front.  These aren't your typical peppermints - they are chocolate mints.  Like Andes chocolate from olive garden, but you can get more than just 1, and it's hard so it lasts longer.  Aside from the overall greatness, it's the little things that make me a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  My friend and I have been there quite often.  Over the years, we try to go out to lunch once a month or every other month and used to try different places.  No more!  We always go to Henry's.  Between the two of us (and she goes there with her husband and when family and friends come to town -- that's where they ask to go for lunch or dinner) there isn't much of the food on the menu that we have not tried.  On a previous trip, I tried Frank's (one of the chefs) Cream of Reuben soup and it was so totally awesome.  We visited Henry's on 8/1; asked Frank when he'd be making it again; he asked when we'd be back; told him 8/13; and lo and behold, he made us Cream of Reuben soup (we both actually got some in \"go boxes\").  The staff at Henry's has always been very friendly; the service is top notch; the place is quiet which is nice so you can actually have a conversation while dining; and it's clean as a whistle.  I have no qualms about visiting Henry's as often as I can.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I love to try new neighborhood bars.  We enjoy sitting at the bar and playing Keno/Poker.  We also enjoy good beer, food and service.    This hidden gem did not disappoint.  Food is excellent. Service was great as the bartender was awesome.  I believe her name was Heather!     My only complaint and reason for the 4 stars rather than 5.....between the 2 of us we gambled over $700.  We walked out w $200.  Why was our dinner not comp'd?   It was our first time there....you would have thought management would have wanted to make a positive impression so that we want to come back.    So, great place....great food and service...but lost $500 and ended up having to pay for our $30 meal?.....hmmm?"}
{"text":"Went here with a bunch of friends. We were the only ones in the place. The service was excellent.  They brought me a whole pitcher of tea..like back when restaurants used to do that.. i had the blue cheese mushroom burger and it was great...everyone I was with said the food was really good. The sweet potato tots were fantastic.  The only downfall was the dessert..i got the fried peanut butter and jelly sandwich. ..it was ok. Not great. And my friend got the bread pudding and said the same..it was good but not great. But if you don't want dessert your golden...there were 6 of us and all of us gave it at least a 8 out of 10...it say go."}
{"text":"I dont usually go to bars. My friends and I tried their food. Yes. To answer your question, the mac and cheese is pretty good. They add tomatos which adds a distinct flavor and I've never had a mac and cheese with such flavor. I do recommend adding a small amount of salt. It will give it a nice one-up of flavor.   I ordered the rib eye steak. Medium well. Im a weenie when it comes to medium rare. MAYBE in the future I'll try it. The rib eye was ok. The taste was mediocre and I also needed to add salt and extra pepper since it was a bit bland.   The service was spot on. Nicole was our server and she was so nice and knowledgeable. The food came pretty quick. I liked that but then again, the food may not be as great tasting."}
{"text":"Used to be a favorite, Frank was awesome as the head chef however last time I went in I was told he was gone.  It's been a while since I had been back and I am sad to say its not the same.  The wings were over cooked, they were supposed to be garlic Parmesan, what used to be a lot of garlic and Parmesan, now is barely garlic and Parmesan.  They just were not the same, they used to be covered in garlic and Parmesan.  The BLT was good but again something from the taste was missing.  It seemed like the bacon was not only over cooked but it almost seemed like they are using a different kind then they used to.  This was a great place for comfort food now it is just an ok place.  They do not have wifi still so that makes it inconvenient as a place to hang or meet with people if you need Internet access.  All in all, this visit was less then spectacular.  I may give it another try some day but there really is no rush after the last two experiences."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at reasonable prices. Friendly service and good prices. Have eaten there about six times. Each time was unusually good. Everything on the menu seems to have an original spin in one way or another. The Henry sandwich is great."}
{"text":"Great little dive bar/grill!!! Nicole the server is badass!!! Food is fantastic... I would highly recommend this place, prices are great and never too crowded!!!"}
{"text":"Today we stopped in to cool down between baseball games. 1 waitress took over 10 minutes to greet us which was actually the bartender the other waitress didnt even try. With 5 tables total it should not take over an hour for a few burgers and a chicken quesadilla. We explained the boys were in between games and we were limited time and were told our food was coming right up. My husband ended up taking the boys to grab fast food which we were trying to avoid due to the boys needed to return to the field. There were a few of us parents who are in the industry and tried to be patient but to be told our food was being plated and coming right up more than once after an hour + and still nothing we walked out. I left more than enough cash on the table for our drinks because Im not a F×÷*ing Shitbag.  Short staff or not I would never treat guests like that."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for dinner since Summer.  Was delighted both times.  Had the Prime Rib the first time (was \"gambling\" ordering that in a restaurant that's a bar-casino) and was pleasantly surprised how good it was (especially considering the low price), waitress was very polite and efficient.  Ordered a pasta-chicken \"special\" recently and couldn't have been more pleased.  Again the service was perfect and even with desert, the check total was a \"bargain\".  My only complaint is they don't have COCA-COLA !"}
{"text":"I would like to give this place a good review but seeing as they have cancelled my Uber order twice without an explanation within 10 min of scheduled delivery time I can't."}
{"text":"Nothing great, food was so-so, smells horrible when you walk-In. Seems that they have a really hard time keeping waitresses, and that just means bad management or ownership. The atmosphere is blah-blah not very welcoming, drab. This has been my fourth time in, it has never been busy maybe if there was more tv s on restaurant side, and updated, to the owner not ever customer is a gamer, the average customer would like a deal also, two stars for its not the employees fault that this place is not run up to par."}
{"text":"Two words: Graveyard Specials OMG these are terrific - a great bargain for great quantity and quality food.  I first came here way back in July when I had just moved out here. My friends were coming to visit, and they had been stuck in traffic for a long time...resulting in them arriving hours past when they were supposed to. Yelp for late night food brought me to this gem. The first time I went, my friends and I, looked at the prices of their graveyard specials and assumed it would be small portions. We couldn't have been more wrong. The portions were very generous! Especially considering the price. I think we accidentally ordered enough to feed an elephant...if an elephant ate cheeseburgers, nachos, pizza, and the like.  I've gone back a couple times since...and every time the food is consistently delicious and a steal. My favorites are the pulled pork sandwich and garlic parmesan chicken tenders. Their pizza is pretty good too. The pulled pork sandwich has just enough kick to it make it something special. The flavor in the garlic parmesan chicken fingers is delicious - I like that they use from what I can tell, shredded parmesan and fresh garlic - not just like powdered parmesan. The teriyaki ones are pretty good as well. Quality and quantity of pizza and toppings is also really good as well as the size of the pizza itself.  The pulled pork sandwich is this big monster...there is a fork in the napkin roll...use it...it will be your friend. The tenders are only $1 each (though they're sold in pairs). These tenders aren't your McDonalds mighty kids fingers...no sir...each one is like the size of my hand. There are 11 preparations you can choose from too to suit your fancy.  In terms of service...it's as fast as it can be given the circumstances. When I go late at night, there's only one person there running the place both bringing orders and working the bar...I think his name is Tom. My guess is there's very few people in the kitchen, maybe even only one. When it's busy, service can be a bit slow (i.e. friday, saturday night). - so I guess this is kind of a quasi complaint. But since there's only one person there running himself ragged, I'm not taking off points. He's also really friendly no matter how busy it is, which I really appreciate.  My one complaint is that the bar area is pretty smoky. Ventilation isn't great. But it's tolerable.   One of these days, I do need to come back to try food on the regular menu, but when I come here late at night, it seems like too much of a shame to not take full advantage of the graveyard specials.  Thank goodness for this place to satisfy my late night munchies. i do stay up late much more than I should...and I'm really glad i found this gem. The value for food from the graveyard menu really can't be beat."}
{"text":"Love it! I come to Henry's for breakfast and dinner all the time and its always great. The wait staff is fantastic and the food is always made perfect."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere   Kids friendly a nice get away and the price is reasonable. But where are their coupons?  I use to get some and feel a little irritated that they are not offering some discounts, it would be nice to get a reward sometimes. Just saying"}
{"text":"After several  trips to this location  I feel like warning everyone,  this place is slow as slow gets. Several  of us come here for our lunch ( we do work night shift) and the bar is so slow, I feel like the staff is sleep walking. We have an hour lunch and seems it is impossible to get a hamburger in this amount of time. Thought maybe it was the bartender  , nope direct person just as slow.  Food isn't worth the headache of the service. Several time soda is flat takes what seems like a decade to get a refill. I did think the Phillie stake sandwich was delicious, one of the best in town ( maybe order it to go).  I have never been into the restaurant side of this location  only the bar side , maybe the staff on that side is quicker one could only hope.   Oh snap , think the bartender might have heard me complaining and brought over a pitcher of soda!"}
{"text":"Great food, everything is made from scratch. The service was also great. They went out of their way to make it a great meal. We will definitely be back to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Nice dive bar! The double cheeseburger was awesome! I would only suggest two things. A burger this good deserves iceberg lettuce not limp soggy green leaf.   And please ditch the SYSCO house ketchup for HEINZ ketchup."}
{"text":"Good food, and service at a great price.  I had the cheeseburger and potato puffs off if the graveyard menu.  The total was only about $5 not including the tip.  The staff was very friendly and helpful and I look forward to coming back again...."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service! If you're looking for a Mom and Pop place in this town this is the place to go!!  We had a burger, drinks and the whiskey bread pudding. We don't regret a single bite!"}
{"text":"Henry's has some really nice options on the menu as well as a daily special.  The food and service are great, but it can be a bit noisy at times.  All things considered, a fine place to dine."}
{"text":"Been going to Henry's for years and have enjoyed it everytime. This morning's visit definitely earned the 5 stars. I can usually judge a place by 2 or 3 items, it's chicken fried steak, sausage gravy and corned beef hash.  My usual order at Henry's is the chicken fried steak but I mixed it up this morning with the hash. Glad that I did, it was amazing. Not your typical diner style hash that resembles something out of a can. This hash had substantial fresh corned beef with onions and peppers cooked perfectly on the flat top grill. Already trying to figure out when I'm going back."}
{"text":"Great bar & grill service with wonderful attitude. Food with that home made flavor you don't get all that often these days."}
{"text":"I've wanted to get a burger from Henry's since I read the burger edition of the Weekly Yelp.  I liked this place the moment I walked in.  The low light, decor, and bar area reminded me of a bar in Washington where I went to college.  Our waitress, Shelly, was very good and she had a good sense of humor (I love banter with a waitress).  My wife's 7-up came with a half pitcher refill that was set on the table.  The half pound cheeseburger was a steal at $4.99!  It was big, delicious, and very filling.  They have specialty burgers for $8.99 that all looked pretty great and come with a side.  The cheaper burger doesn't come with a side but fries are only $2.50.  The onion rings and fries were great.  My wife had the Reuben and, while it was very tasty, the meat could have been sliced a bit thinner.  Beers were cheap at $3.75 for domestic but I think this place really needs to have a happy hour.  If they did, I would come here a couple Fridays a month (being a teacher is stressful).  I would chalk this one up to about 3 and 1/2 stars but I liked it so much I'm goin to round up!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't stop at Henry's earlier.  It's in the same strip mall as the place we mail packages, so I've driven by it several times.  Today, we finally had lunch here.  The dining room is bigger than you would expect given its location, with room between most of the tables.  They had some pushed together, but it was not close to being crowded, so it didn't matter.  We were waited on immediately (service was excellent throughout the meal), and as a few yelpers note, they leave a pitcher of your selected beverage (for us, Dr. Pepper and water) at your table.  Also, I request a lot of ice in my fountain drinks.  The server brought me a whole glass of ice in addition to the pitchers.  The glasses at Henry's are large, so the pitcher was about a refill, maybe a little more.  But, I feel like this touch demonstrates a little care for the customer.  Also, we all know how frustrating it can be to eat, finish your drink, and you can't get the server's attention for a refill while you are still eating.  I wish more restaurants would adopt Henry's practice.  They probably lose a little bit of soda or tea when pitchers aren't finished, but that's maybe 2 cents worth of liquid, well worth it to provide better service in my estimation.  We had chips and salsa to start.  The salsa was good consistency, not runny like some chains, but also not totally chunky like pico de gallo.  The chips needed some salt and weren't warm, but that's not a huge issue.  To eat, the wife had the shrimp dinner.  This is a fantastic deal, 7 large fried shrimp, a huge order of fries and a portion of cole slaw for $10.  The shrimp was not overly done, which can happen when it's fried.  Excellent consistency.  The fries are of a thickness between thin fries (think McDonald's) and steak fries.  The breading was crunchy.  Very very good fries.  I will say the ranch appeared to be from a bottle.  I couldn't say for sure, but it was probably the least impressive part of the meal.  I had the bourbon BBQ burger with waffle fries.  This was a very juicy burger.  It's a large burger consisting of 2 patties on an onion bun.  I could have used more fried onions.  They are smaller, not the longer shoestring type onions.  So, they often fell out.  It was tough to get a complete bite of all the ingredients together.  The bacon was very VERY crispy.  I'm okay with it this done, but a lot of people aren't.  I had to finish the burger with my fork it was so messy.  But, it was fantastic.  And, it was only $9.  I didn't even finish the waffle fries, there were that many on the plate.  These were large and very well seasoned.    Although we didn't go into the bar, it looked comfortable.  A large bar with a couch area that had a couple of chairs.  Looked to be very cozy, and had a few people in around 1 pm on Sunday.  We will definitely return, and like I said, I'm kicking myself for not coming here sooner."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and attentive.  Fantastic atmosphere, and hearty portions.  They brew an amazing cup of coffee that I enjoyed with my 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns and wheat toast.  Will be making future stops especially for their graveyard specials that run until 7am."}
{"text":"I like Henry's.  It's not fancy but who cares?  It has inexpensive and good food which is served in large portions.  We tried their pork chop meal, southwest burger, and side salad which were all delicious.  On top of that, our server was friendly and helpful. So when we are in town, we will definitely be stopping by this restaurant; it's our type of place!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times now. At first it was because Dyanna L told me they had $3 bloody mary's on Sunday's during football. But the food is excellent as well! Plus, super reasonably priced considering how much food you get.  So right off I ordered a Bloody Mary. Be prepared to wait. The waitress rocks, it's just there is only one of her, but it's worth the wait to me. My drink was super strong and tangy! Just how I like it. It also came with a lemon and olive for garnish. As for their other drinks like soda, tea or water they serve it to you in a little pitcher so you can refill it yourself. I love that!  Some of my favorite items to order include the Gravy Fries. They have a brown or white gravy. I really love the brown. Coupled with the super crisp fries the gravy is a perfect salty/savory kick. I have gotten their Club Sandwich which is huge!! I always get it with rye bread. (They don't list it as a side option, but if you ask you can order a side salad instead of their other choices.) The Pesto Chicken sandwich on focaccia is full of flavor and the chicken was moist and not over cooked. Also, I really enjoy their regular house salad. Joel loves their Baked Ziti. If you love pasta this place has a weekly pasta special. They also serve breakfast ALL day on Sundays.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and laid back. You can choose to sit in the restaurant part or the bar area. You can get the specials no matter where you sit.   This place is a winner for me. Great food and tasty drinks. They need maybe one more waitress on busy days. The one they have is super friendly and helpful. I can't wait to go back to try something else off their tasty menu!"}
{"text":"I had the Bourbon burger with sweet potato tots and it was amazing!!!  I wish I lived locally so I could eat here all the time."}
{"text":"We were running a relay race that had us in this part of town while waiting for one of our runners. Found this place on a Yelp, it's awesome! We enjoyed it so much we went back the next day. Both times Tom was our waiter, he's very friendly and enjoyable. The hash browns are the best I've had. If you are going to spend calories on eating hash browns, theses are the ones to eat! Golden and perfectly crispy. Tasty pancakes too that are perfect texture."}
{"text":"Came here with my sweetie.   We just moved into the neighborhood.   First, the chicken wings were outstanding!   I had the shrimp and grits and we both thought it was good and would order again.  Her fish and chips were ok - not great, not bad.  But we both thought the housemade coleslaw that came with it was a winner.  We will come again."}
{"text":"Was here at 12 noon on Sun/22 Mar: - Right-half is a dimly lit bar. - Left-half of the establishment is a well-lit family friendly restaurant. - Service was good and for the iced tea and ice water we ordered, the waitress left at our table a pitcher of iced tea and a pitcher of ice water. - Unfortunately food was not good except for the side order of french fries.  My friends said the soup of the day was too salty and they couldn't even finish half of it.  My $11 steak & eggs order: meat was really subpar (and I already had low expectations from a $11 steak & eggs meal) and the hash browns were burnt.  The 2 eggs were good. - I would only come back for the bar to booze, or to eat while boozed."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  We had the prime rib sandwich, and an order of chicken wings.  The sandwich was very good, and the wings were nice and spicy.  Unfortunately we did not enjoy our late lunch as we felt the service was poor.  At no point did we feel welcomed, and for the most part felt like we were an annoyance to the bartender who served us.    Unfortunately there are many places in this area with great food, and in my experience better service.  I would not recommend to a friend due to our experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get the awesome Habanero Mac & Cheese and got great service as usual.  But on top of this, I was on my way to the ATM to make a $600 cash deposit, but left my wallet on top of the bar.  An awesome bartender name Danii found it and held on to it until I arrived back at the restaurant 30 minutes later.  Left her another $$$ tip and wanted to make sure that I acknowledge her and the entire establishment for good food and great service."}
{"text":"I've never had anything subpar here.  It's good grub for a good price.  My recommendation is to TRY THE CHEESEBURGER PIZZA.  Oh my... makes me feel like a kid again.    This place is kind of a dive.  It's pretty dark and the decor is very dated.  That just makes me like it even more - if the ambiance sucks, the food sometimes makes up for it.  This is one of those cases."}
{"text":"I had the Hank sandwich. It was great! Our waitress Angela was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. Menu has many items"}
{"text":"First off the outside of this place and the decor could scare anybody away. There is just something about the colors and decor or maybe even the word fonts themselves that make me almost shriek. I've driven by the place a million times over the past 8 years and never went in. Thought I'd give it a try after reading reviews here.  First time we went we got pot roast and a bleu cheese burger. Consider yourself warned, this burger is HUGE, and I think it's real meat not cheaper filler. This was made with two heavy patties and a bleu cheese sauce and waffle fries were good too. The pot roast comes with potatoes, carrots and a fresh roll. It was so tender you could cut it with a fork. Went a few more times and tried soups and pastas. The pasta was exotic and different.  The clam chowder was excellent. The turkey soup was good but slightly cold, all I had to do was send it back and I didn't bother asking.  The waitresses are nice and attentive.  If you ask for coffee you get a carafe, if you ask for water you get a pitcher.   We enjoyed lunch items, haven't tried pizza yet. We didn't dig the onion rings too much they too thick and the breading fell off making them kinda pointless.  We tried the breakfast and it was OK. I think we ordered wrong for what we wanted, we got omelette's and the toast was cold and hard ( in their defense we are having a cold spell here and it was cold in there in general so hot toast wasn't gonna happen despite any efforts), The eggs were OK, nothing special, same with the hash browns. Then after we ate the waitress showed us the eggs and pancakes order someone else got and we were covetous... OK.. next time!! That plate looked to be more up our alley and a better deal. There are a few affordable breakfast items but some are over priced. If they served a cheap breakfast 24 hours I'd bet their clientele would beef up.  We haven't done much dinner here or pasta, never tried that. Overall its very good American food, most items are a decent or big portion. The prices are kinda all over the place but you get options too like with the pasta special you can order a 1/2 portion for 1/2 price or you can get a single burger for less.   I think like anywhere else you just have to know what to order. If I could go up to 3 1/2 stars in the rating I would."}
{"text":"Not even. 1 star.   The owner Todd is a  douchebag to women Rude. Breathes down their necks. Picks at them for everything  So annoying.  Let employees work and keep your inexperienced micro managing self out of there  No one even wants to work for you Change your ways  or sell and do something you can work on your own"}
{"text":"Came here based off other yelpers reviews and they were not lying. Yummy!! Great prices, delicious flavors, and huge menu. We had 2 kinds of chicken strips- bbq & hot sweet chili - sweet potato puffs and the 2 egg breakfast. Excited to finish off our left-overs after we recover from our food coma."}
{"text":"At midnight the fries are a dollar each and burgers are 3-4 USD. They are really delicious and totally worth the money if you have a late night craving. Although I don't recommend the sweet potato puffs - get the regular fries instead. Oh, and the nachos are just delish!"}
{"text":"The husband and I shared Christmas Dinner at Henry's because, first, it was the only place open and NOT a casino. What a pleasant surprise! The food was amazing. My husband ordered the Bunker Hill and was pleased enough to declare it at 10 out of 10. I asked for a chicken fettuchini, while not on the menu, the chef gladly made it for me and it was outstanding.  Our waitress, Kimberly, was friendly and accomodating.  We enjoyed the quiet space. An unobutrusive atmosphere with not a lot of fellow diners (which I attribute to Christmas Day more than anything)."}
{"text":"What a great local find! We were in an area of town we aren't familiar with so we gave this place a shot. Fast service, good food, and reasonable prices. The quesadilla and sweet potato puffs were great. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan! For serious, though, this place is cool. It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food. $3 bottle domestic beers, which is about as cheap as you're gonna get in this town! It's smokey in there, but that doesn't really bother me. I got this beef brisket sandwich, it was THICK! That's what she said. Very good, though! And waffles fries, yum! A great place to go that feels more like home; I'm from Georgia and there are places like this everywhere. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I shared a bourbon bbq burger + waffle fries with my GF on a saturday afternoon for 11.   - Good portion! I asked to split and they ended up cooking 2 patties! nice size for a half a burger each. burger was juicy, not too red, tasty! loved it! - Service was fast and friendly. Maybe bc we were the only ones there? lol. Everyone said hi, even the chef.  - waffle fries portion was not very much.  - gives you a extra pitcher for water :)  :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Our new favorite. Great food selection. Love that the bar and casino are separate from the restaurant.  The portions are huge. Hamburgers made fresh daily. Nachos were really good. Covered in cheese sauce and some kind of bean sauce. Absolutely to die for. Double yummy."}
{"text":"Ordered blackened pork chop, and that's what I got, a severely overdone chop. So bad I didn't take more then two bites. I mean I could barely get the fork in.  On the other hand I was totally jealous of my wife's original philly steak, she did get a little mad that I was eating it. The worst part was the 25 min wait just to pay my check, but it was sort of understandable since there were only two servers. Overall I will go again and just stick to the sandwich menu."}
{"text":"This is a great local grill/bar for good grub, drinks and gaming.  They have a separate bar area from the restaurant so we ate first in the dining room and then headed to the bar for drinks and video poker.  The decor isn't consistent or memorable but it's a quirky and comfortable place.  The menu was large and there are great breakfast/lunch/dinner options.  Oddly, breakfast is not offered 24/7 here unlike other similar places in the area.  The service was good and food was out quickly.  It is your basic diner/grill food but cooked to perfection and very delicious!    We received excellent service at the bar and drinks were free while we gambled.    I will definitely switch off between Timbers and Henry's when I'm in the mood for an evening close to home."}
{"text":"The corn beef hash is really good !  This has the making to be one of the best American dinner restaurant in all of Henderson, Nevada.      Major issue is the management is very  petty about charging additional fees for substituting  very minor items is going to hold the restaurant from getting the fifth star .  If a customer wants a Turkey dip and wants to substitute turkey for roast beef there shouldn't charge a fee to switch the two meats.   Granting a small change for a customer at no charge, will get you return business!  We really enjoyed the food, however we like turkey dips too and at most other restaurants that serve both turkey and Roast beef they will all substitute turkey for beef.  What ever makes the customer happy right!"}
{"text":"I so rarely give a 5-star review, but Henry's completely deserves these accolades!  The service was spot on (Thank you, Kat! You were on-the-ball, super friendly and totally awesome!) and the food was absolutely out of this world! (Kim The Cook, you're he bomb! )  Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs: We lucked out and arrived late on a Sunday, so breakfast was still being served... and we totally scored! The Chicken Fried Steak is made IN HOUSE! No pre-made garbage here! So perfectly cooked it didn't even need a knife. And the sausage gravy was flavorful and totally complimented the Chicken Fried Steak. The eggs were cooked to perfection.  The hash-browns were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  Coming from Texas, we KNOW what a superb Chicken Fried Steak is supposed to taste like... And this one would give even the best in Texas a run for its money. Absolutely the best Chicken Fried Steak meal we've ever had in Vegas, hands down.    BLT Club: can you say bacon-bacon-bacon?! They do NOT skimp on the bacon! It was so big, I could barely wrap my mouth around it! The sourdough was toasted wonderfully... Just overall an awesome sandwich served w super yummy waffle fries.  Pancake: ranks right up there w some of the best tasting and perfectly cooked pancakes ever.  Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and soaked up the butter and syrup like a delicious sponge. Omg, I could not stop myself from having more-more-more of this delectable treat!  This place is epic, and we cannot say enough good things about Henry's.  We'll definitely be coming back... And can't wait to try the Mac & Cheese!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Good service! Reasonable prices! That chicken Cajun pasta was awesome! And look at the size of that ribeye! Wow"}
{"text":"We ordered three philly cheese steak sandwiches and waffle fries. The food was nothing special. The place was dead when we arrived 4pm. The food took about 25min. It smells little like cigarette smoke. Service was okay."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Henry's. It was after a vigorous hike and I was starved. The food is simple but you can tell they use good quality ingredients. We were a party of three, including my 6 year old nephew. We started with nachos..crisp and very tasty. The beans tasted homemade and it was a generous portion. We shared a prime rib sandwich that was also very yummy and also shared a Ruben that was a bit too salty in my opinion. We ordered the waffle fries with both sandwiches. Overall good food. The waitress was very kind and attentive. It's not my normal everyday cuisine so I probably won't be going there often but if you happen to be in that area and want decent food, give this place a try."}
{"text":"This actually makes me sad, as we sit here now, the food is still good, it comes down to the service, there are 2 waitresses and a chef, we are the only customers, are drinks have now been sitting empty for the past 20 minutes, of course they could have been filled, but that would take one I f the waitresses actually leaving the kitchen area to check on us.....So I guess we will only be coming in during dinner.....Time to pay the bill, guess it will be cash as they have now disappeared into the cold storage."}
{"text":"Always great food; burgers, salads, wings and sandwiches. Sit down and enjoy in the restaurant or take it to go. Staff is super friendly, enjoy your next meal there."}
{"text":"Holly Shit!! This place rocks!! We had to try the Mac and Cheese, The Henry Sandwich with mushrooms! Cobb Salad! Fresh ingredients best steak sandwich my honey has ever had!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in town, if I could give it 100 stars I would! I went there for my first date over a year ago and had prompt service from a very nice server. The food was taking a tad longer as it was first thing in the morning but we were constantly kept up to date on our food. When that food arrived it was so good, succulent, juicy, savory. Perfect amount of toppings. All fresh. All worth the price. I can't wait to come back because Henry's has my business so long as I'm here and it's there."}
{"text":"Large, varied menu, breakfast all day on Sundays.  We started with gravy fries, something every diner in NJ had growing up.  I have to say, these are some of the best gravy fries in Las Vegas.  Crisp, startchy fries covered in a gooey gravy that reminds me of... well, hometown diners.  For our main course, my daughter had buttered pasta which was shells.  It could have used a little more flavor but she enjoyed it.  The two large pieces of garlic bread was too much for a kids meal and one half piece would have been sufficient. (This is not a negative, but more of a suggestion that would both save money and keep the kids from eating too many carbs.)  I went with the fried clams.  The clams themselves were real clams, chewy and stretchy.  They would have been great but the coating was overcooked and to heavily coated so it was difficult to get the clam flavor without peeling off the coating. Next time I will try one of their specials like country fried steak.   For desert we split a fudge sundae.  The staff was happy to take the peanuts off for us even though the menu stated they were on there and we just didn't pay attention.    Service was excellent. Our server was very attentive, very honest about the menu options and made sure we had everything we needed several times.  I enjoyed that they bring a whole pitcher of tea or lemonade to your table so you don't have to find them for a refill.  Henry's is a great addition to the Henderson cuisine.  I am hopeful my next trip will raise the rating a star."}
{"text":"9:00 PM Wednesday night - looking for late chow. One waitress and 1 other table. Asian chicken salad? Cabbage swimming in dressing, topped by a scarcely cooked chicken breast. Took one bite and inspected the sliced breast - not thoroughly cooked. Waitress is nowhere; after about 10 minutes I took it to the cook myself. He argued that it was indeed cooked; further cooking would burn it. I asked him to return it to the grill anyway. He used his HANDS to pluck slices off the top, then grilled them. After a few moments of sizzling (which seemed promising) he used a spatula to return the slices to my salad while I stood at the service counter. I brought the plate back and bit into a piece of chicken that still had that unmistakable raw texture. Waitress still nowhere. I couldn't even nibble the sad heap of cabbage. Finished my wine, which was supposed to be Pinot Grigio; not sure what sort of wine it actually was; color and flavor more like Chardonnay. Left hungry. If this place is your idea of good dining, please don't write reviews!"}
{"text":"Real shame. Went Saturday morning for breakfast. Party of 4. Service was horrible. The waitress had a total of 3 tables and was over her head. We waited 45 minutes for our food. We watched it set in the window for 15 minutes and she was busy deliverying drinks to another table. We finally just left. No excuse for service this horrible. Waitress needs to be fired immediately."}
{"text":"Not sure where to get dinner on Sunday evening, my wife and I ended up giving Henry's a try.  We walked in and seated ourselves (hoping that was proper etiquette) in some rather spacious, long booths. The one front of house staff person delivered some tables' food, then brought us menus.  Perusing their offerings, I decided to give their \"World's Best Mac & Cheese\" a try. Since I wanted more than just cheesy pasta, I added the chicken option.  With our glasses of water, the server also brought out a small pitcher of water for us, which was nice to have handy!  Let's put it this way, one pound of mac and cheese, with a chicken breast makes for a HUGE plate of food to see appear before one's self. My wife and I both took exploratory bites of the pound of cheesy mac. It was....  ...  Barely mediocre.   The cheese was not very flavorful, there was an abundance of melted, yellow cheese throughout.   The chicken was... well, it started out as chicken. It was grilled on an open flame, so the outside was charred pretty good and the inside was half dry and tough, half almost moist. There was no flavor beyond charcoal.  $16 for a pound of mediocre mac and cheese, with a burnt chicken breast? I think this place will not be getting my business again for a while.  My wife will review her food, as it was equally (or more) underwhelming than this dish."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Henry's for quite awhile now, but always forget about it when it comes time to decide where to eat.  Recently my Mom and I were on our way to another nearby restaurant, but I realized that we were so close to Henry's that we should just stop, so we did.  And I am glad we did!  Located in a strip mall off Stephanie St., it's kind of hidden away.  Kind of a random spot for a 24 hour bar/restaurant.  First of all, only the bar side is actually open 24 hours.  The restaurant side closes at 10pm on weeknights (not sure about weekends).  After the restaurant closes, you have to be 21 to dine, since it's in the bar.  No big deal.  We entered the restaurant and were approached by the server, who told us to sit wherever we like.  We chose a booth and she gave us menus.  They have quite a selection!  From appetizers to salads, to burgers, pasta, steak, etc!  My Mom and I just about always share everything.  We decided to split the 1/2 size cobb salad, the 1/2 size mac 'n cheese and the ribeye steak.  The first thing you should know is that the portions here are pretty big.  Come hungry!  Our salad was good and came with all of the typical fixin's - hard boiled egg, bleu cheese, olives, avocado, bacon, chicken, etc.  It was larger than we expected, and pretty good.  The mac n cheese came in a large bowl, and I couldn't believe it was only the 1/2 portion.  It's supposedly made with 5 cheeses and roasted red pepper, which added a different touch.  I don't think it was a my favorite ever, but it was OK.  I would like to go back and try the habanero hamburger mac n cheese.  Sounds right up my alley!  Our ribeye was huge and cooked perfectly (medium rare).  It came with a side of snap peas and we chose jasmine rice for something different.  Everything was really tasty.  Unfortunately, the server mentioned that they are changing the menu and the ribeye will only be available for about 2 more weeks.  Then it will be replaced by a t-bone.  We were pretty stuffed, but couldn't pass up trying the brownie dessert.  Holy crap, this is a chocolate lover's heaven!  It was a LARGE brownie, topped with hot fudge, vanilla ice cream, ANOTHER LARGE BROWNIE (!!), more hot fudge and then whipped cream and cherries.  It was humongous and way more than we could eat.  Very rich as well.  I would definitely recommend this for all of you with sweet tooths!  The service was fast and friendly, although there wasn't really anyone else in the place while we were there.  The server also mentioned to us that just about everything is home made.  They don't buy anything frozen, they roast all of the meats in house, etc.  That's good to know!  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner.  I would definitely go back, and I have to return to try this graveyard special burger everyone raves about!"}
{"text":"Sometimes its all about the little things.   Dropped in here to grab a late breakfast, but they stopped serving at 11am. So I went with a lunch plate, chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, peas, and a roll ($11), along with an iced tea ($1.99).  Located in a shopping mall area off Stephanie, you walk in and get the choice of dining in a clean, bright dining area, or heading into the bar area which is a bit darker and smokier. Its a nice menu of comfort foods. Plenty of selection.  Now to the little things that make it a nice meal. Pleasant service and frequent check backs. Ice tea in a glass, and in a 32 oz pitcher for refills. Butter that isn't frozen but soft and easily spreadable. A steak knife that wasn't necessary because the chicken fried steak was cooked perfectly and you could cut with a fork. Portion sizes that are plenty.   Very solid choice if you want a good meal, pleasant service, fair prices. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Gravy fries were delicious. Had the prime rib sandwich..also good.  I had to eat it with a knife and fork but that was no problem. Service was great. The place was clean. I would suggest this place to friends.   I live in the northwest but if I'm in the area I would go there again. Those gravy fries were the bomb!!"}
{"text":"3 stars because the mac and cheese is the best I've ever had but only 3 stars because the blackened chicken that I added on for a pricey $5 tasted absolutely foul. It was inedible and tasted like it had not been defrosted properly. I suggest ordering it plain or trying it with bacon instead... hopefully the bacon tastes better because the chicken was a huge letdown."}
{"text":"This has consistently been a top purveyor of comfort food.  And, my last visit for dinner was no exception.  Pretty much everything I have ordered here I have liked.  On this outing it was a spicy starter of Henry's Ground Beef Nachos prepared with fresh tortilla chips, scallions, tomatoes, Black Olives, Jalapeno Peppers, housemade salsa, Nacho Cheese Sauce, sour cream, and homemade chili; a bowl of excellent clearly homemade Vegetable Soup, with celery, carrots, zucchini, tomatoes, mushrooms, and a very tasty broth; and a large Salisbury Steak covered with great Burgundy Mushroom Gravy accompanied by creamy Mashed Potatoes.  Fellow diners at my table enjoyed Fish & Chips, a Blackened Chicken Sandwich, and a Pulled Pork Sandwich.    Our waitress was friendly and efficient, and the casual surroundings were pleasant.  But it is the fine cooking here that really stands out."}
{"text":"Great food friendly staff.  We go on the graveyard shift and the midnight specials are a great value."}
{"text":"Wanted to try somewhere new for dinner but everywhere we went had a long wait. Decided on Henry's since we were close by and there was no wait. It's an interesting set up with an enclosed bar on one side and the \"restaurant\" on the other. There are booths and the sides and sort of communal tables in the middle.   We were seated quickly and had our drink orders taken right away. I ordered \"The Hank\" which is a prime rib sandwich with grilled peppers and onions. Once the food arrived the service ended. The sandwich was very salty and the prime rib had a good amount of fat in it (even for prime rib). I kept biting in to large pieces of fat.   The sweet potato tots (or puffs as they call them) were okay, nothing great. The waitress never returned. We had to flag her down for a to go box, again for the check, and again to take the check. I would categorize Henry's as bar food and not much more. Its great that its open 24 hours so if your looking for a late night snack this might do the trick. For dinner though I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times, with different ratings.  The first time I got the hamburger.  Wow, was that good!  Second time was the Rueben.  It was good, but nothing outstanding.  Overall I liked it.  Tonight I got the \"Bunker Hill\" which was supposed to be roast beef, smoked gouda and sprouts.  Unfortunately the roast beef was really more like sliced pot roast.  I guess it I was a big pot roast fan I would have liked it more."}
{"text":"So if you are stuck in Vegas and starving with a car full of other starving people that are whining and complaining that are under 21 then sure stop here. Other than that continue driving. Your toilet will appreciate it. However some people at the table said that the pork sandwich had a great tang to it. That is why we gave 2 stars."}
{"text":"Very good service from Miles. My wife had the special, shrimp alfredo, and really liked it.  She got the 1/2 order and it was more than enough.   I got the Henry with sweet potato puffs, and I'll give the sandwich a 3.5, was a little tough for prime rib, would have been as expected for a steak sand.  The puff were ok but needed something to dip in or something. But all in all a good casual place to eat."}
{"text":"We have been here twice so far.  There's really nothing to complain about!  The food was good and our waiter Miles was totally attentive and full of personality!  He even remembered us from our first time which was really nice!  It's a local place and just the right combination of feeling welcome,  good food and great service.  Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Located in an obscure mini mall in Henderson, I came here with my friend on a drizzly day in July.   When we arrived the restaurant was pretty empty. Just one other table was occupied, so the waitress told us to sit wherever we liked. Henry's has a home-y vibe. Lots of large booths and tables available to accommodate large and small parities alike.  Our server approached us quickly for our drink order and returned swiftly with our drinks and carafes for each of us. As someone who requires lots of refills, I was a fan of this.   Everything on the menu looked great so it took a while to figure out what we wanted. Our server helped us out by letting us know what her favorites on the menu were. She also explained that everything is made from scratch, so I was already excited about our meal.  My friend ordered the Savannah burger with waffle fries and I ordered the fried shrimp with crispy fries and cole slaw. The food came out and it was delicious. My friend's burger was enormous and despite his hearty appetite was only able to finish half before throwing in the towel. My shrimp was tasty and fresh.   I really wanted to try their desserts, but we were just too full. We will definitely be back next time for that.   Service was friendly and incredibly attentive, as well."}
{"text":"If you don't come see Brian here for drinks, you're missing out! Good place, good people!"}
