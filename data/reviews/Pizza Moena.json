{"text":"I love to try new pizza places, especially pizza shops that are not \"chains\" or where the pizzas are made on conveyor belt ovens. This pizza is not made on a conveyor belt oven and it is evident the ingredients are fresh and made to order carefully. I ordered an extra large pizza with extra cheese, mushrooms, and pepperoni for delivery. The Italian man that answered the phone was very nice and made me feel like my business was important to him. It took about 45 minutes for delivery, which is not long since the pizza is \"oven cooked.\" The pizza arrived hot and fresh and the delivery driver was professional and courteous. The pizza, however, was just ok. It looked like it was going to be amazing, but unfortunately it was very average. There really wasn't any flavor. It was very bland. The cheese, sauce, and even with pepperoni and sausage, the pizza didn't taste like anything. With a little seasoning of my own, the pizza was much better. I wish I could give it a better recommendation, but when you open up a pizza shop, due to so much competition, you should know your pizza is better than most of the other shops around you. This pizza simply is not. It is slightly above average but I would not order this again over some of the many other pizza options around the area... I wish I could give it a better review but this is my honest opinion."}
{"text":"Great food and service from a small local pizza shop.  We have yet to not be completely satisfied with pizza, subs, calzones, etc. from Pizza Moena.  Definitely a good alternative to the big chains."}
{"text":"Not a fan. The pizza was pretty expensive. I got two pizzas and a small hoagie and the bill was 50 or more...I then adjusted my order because the toppings cost soooooooo much! Anyways, I judge a good pizza by sauce, cheese and dough... the dough wasn't fully cooked and was gummy, there was hardly any sauce, and the cheese formed a gelatinous layer the was thick and hard to bite! I def judge a pizza by quality of cheese and this cheese was def cheap:( disappointed as hoping for another go to place but pizzas at home it is....I will say the stars I gave are for incredibly kind and nice service.....still searching for a delicious white pizza!"}
{"text":"Just ordered tonight and want to say that this is a much needed addition to pizza joints around Burrell/new ken. Food came hot, was delicious and probably the best new pizza place that actually gives you a lot of food for a great price.  Order from here with no hesitation, it's well worth it. The pizza is very cheesy, nice size and thickness.. And the hoagie was huge and very meaty, all around awesome place and will be  our go to."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza it's delicious probably the best pizza place in the new ken Burrell area. The crust is amazing chewy and crisp all at the same time"}
