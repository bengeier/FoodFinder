{"text":"Quaint, family-owned, classy restaurant lit only by clear christmas tree lights and their reflection in the many mirrors that accompany the walls of the main dining room. There is also an adjoining room that is perfect for private parties, baby showers, rehearsal dinners, etc. The menu is absolutely delicious. Large portion sizes of each dish, and the steak and seafood prices are quite reasonable. There's that one place you look forward to visiting each year on your birthday... this place is mine."}
{"text":"Some lady friends and I lunch at Mahle's nearly every week. The food is consistently okay to very good, depending on what you order. The eggplant parmesan , for instance, is lightly breaded and quickly fried so that it is crispy and not heavy or oily. The burgers are thick,  juicy and cooked to your liking. Green salads are not their strong suit but are good if ordered with chicken or steak or salmin strips. Pork chops, fried chicken and chicken or tuna salad are all very satisfying. The wait staff, especially Sarah and Mary, really care about getting it right."}
{"text":"I don't know if there are enough words to describe how mad I am right now!!! We decided to go to Mahle's again tonight because my husband and I wanted a good dinner and I wanted prime rib.  We got there and waited, and waited, and waited.  Finally, one of the waitresses said someone would be with us in a minute.  A few minutes later, another waitress said someone would help us.  After at least 15 minutes, may have been longer, the hostess appeared and really wasn't nice.  Mind you, we had been staring at an empty table this whole time.  Instead of seating us there, we had to wait for a different table to be bussed and reset.  So finally the guy that bussed and set the table said we could sit there as he was passing us.  

So, we sit and look at the menu.  After a few minutes we know what we want.  We waited and waited and waited.  The waitresses were all busy around us, none ever stopped at our table.  We waited for at least 15 more minutes and finally decided to leave.  

Such a shame!  We used to like going there.  I'll never go back, and I'll tell everyone I know not to either."}
{"text":"Caters to older crowd but very complete menu from burgers to steaks, prime rib, pasta and seafood.  Every course was excellent.  Prime rib perfectly cooked.  This may become my new favorite place.  Reservations are suggested on the weekend.  It has a Cheers atmosphere where everyone seems to know everyone.  Norm!!!!"}
{"text":"Another wonderful dish I decided to try the blackened mahi mahi with a Cajun crab sauce. One word, delicious. The west suburbs of Cleveland have no shortage of great places to eat and this is one of the best don't miss out on this locally owned gems."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my out of town family and had a wonderful experience. Everything was delicious and I was surprised with how satisfied everyone was. It is really hard to make each person in a group of 7 happy, but there was nothing negative to say. The lady Donna that took care of us was the most attentive and sincere waitress I've ever had. This place definitely gets an A+ from me!"}
{"text":"Good food, great prices! Mahle's has a good menu offering options of seafood, steaks, and a few Italian dishes. The preparations are basic, but done well. I had the walleye - nice to get a freshwater fish other than trout. Total bill for a cocktail, two glasses of wine, and two dinners was $66."}
{"text":"In what world is this a four or five star restaurant?  I took my mother in law and wife here today based on the previously high reviews in Yelp. This is a mediocre restaurant at best--limited menu (spaghetti and fill in the blank, meat with cheese, frozen fish special), poorly prepared food, dingy dining room.  I've had better meals off the back roads in Eastern Europe.  Really, folks. Five stars? Where else do you eat?"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding! Great food, great location, great prices, love it! First time here too. I can't believe it but this is definitely the new place! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went for a work function and even with a group of 50 people, the service was great. The room we had looked great. The food was superb. I would recommend to anyone. 

Dislike: If you are going to serve shrimp on a pasta, take the tails off."}
{"text":"I had lunch here the week of 10-10-16.  Mahle's serves simple, good quality food on a very consistent basis.  I've been having lunch fairly regularly at Mahle's
for more than 10 years.  They serve an older crowd of mostly local, loyal, repeat customers.  They have daily specials that are always really very good and taste like they are made on premises. All meals are served w/good, warm Italian bread & butter.  They also make a darn good burger & fries for $7.50.  I had today's special, prime rib w/mashed potatoes & gravy for $10.99 and it was delicious.  The meat was grilled perfectly and was a generous portion, I'm guessing about 8-10 oz., plenty for me.  Each day they have at least 4-8 specials plus an extensive menu.  Cold foods always served cold, hot foods always served piping hot.  This is not a trendy place.  It's a great place to have a very good meal.  I don't eat dinner here as prices jump considerably for dinner, just as at most places.  I'd give this place a fifth star if they did some refurbishing which seems to be a bit overdue in my opinion.  Service is always good."}
{"text":"Other reviewers weren't kidding about the \"older\" crowd. I'm 37 and was easily one of the youngest there. I had the chicken Parmesan. It was alright. I was the only one sitting at the bar. I waited an incredibly long time for the server to take my order and an especially long time for the server to take my credit card to pay my bill. Only one local seasonal beer on tap, so I got a domestic bottle which was very well priced."}
{"text":"Randomly went here because we drove by and my grandma wanted to try it. The place looks old, and most of the customers and servers are also old. The mussels we ordered smelled rotten. My chicken parmesan was actually good. Unfortunately the steak we got had a leftover receipt ticket underneath drenched in sauce. Pretty gross. Overall just a weird and bad experience."}
{"text":"Food was really good and not expensive. We Decided to stop here after reading the reviews and we enjoyed ourself. More of an older crowd."}
{"text":"Mahles restaurant is the \"Cheers\" of Westlake. The food is excellent, consistent and affordable.  It is an independent,  family run operation that treats each customer like family.  It's nice to have lunch or dinner where you are treated well, the food is excellent and the staff is great.
It's not a sports bar. You can catch a score but the restaurant is geared towards cocktails,  conversations and a great meal."}
{"text":"Upon walking in there's a few things you'll notice. This place is old and outdated. The decor needs a fresh update. The cliental is aged 60+. But it's worth checking out as a lunch spot, or maybe even a quiet, cheap, dinner. 

It took me a while to warm up to it. My first time here the bartenders seemed cranky that a 20 something year old, non-regular bar guest would even sit at the bar. They seemed rude and uninviting. I felt out of place. But the food is cheap, and good. It's Flavorful, with large, filling portions. Extensive menu choices and multiple daily specials always kept me from deciding what I want  and kept me coming back. 

Finally, after maybe the 3rd visit, the bartenders warmed up to me. Im a regular now. They know my drink. They invited me to join their lunch club. They are friendly and attentive. 

The value alone of this restaurant is worth checking out, even if you're in the younger age bracket. The food has a classic mom and pop, down to earth, home cooked meal taste and the price is so cheap, it makes it so worth it. I encourage you to give it a try. Don't let the outdated, old person vibe discourage you!"}
{"text":"Having our work christmas party here.  So far it's decent, I seen better but can't really complain.  Looks nice and the food taste great."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times, and we're impressed for the price. Food and service are both really good. We'll be back! :-)"}
{"text":"Fabulous family and fabulous experience every time. The house salad dressing and bread are so tasty."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the past 7 years and haven't been let down. 
The atmosphere inside is very classy and relatively quiet. The service is exceptional. There aren't many places anymore where the staff attempts to get to know you and greets you by name. They are so friendly here! 

The food is outstanding. I love the Lake Erie Perch, although I haven't been disappointed by a dish here ever. 

It's a slightly older crowd here. I was taken by my parents, and it remains a favorite go-to place of theirs since their first time. I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"So very disappointed in our visit this evening.   We were a group of 40 who had a choice of 5 menu items and alerted the restaurant of the choices before our reservation tonight, so everything should have been ready for us.  There were 5 tables and our table happened to be in the middle so we were told that we would have 2 servers so they could split the room.  That didn't happen, so our table was treated like the red headed step-child.   Our group started arriving at 5:30 and the last people showed at 6:00.   At 6:20, we still didn't have a server to take our drink order.   Finally, when drinks arrived, 2 people got Long Island iced teas and they were vastly different.   One was loaded with Coca-Cola and the other wasn't.   We were brought a plate of bread and butter at 6:30.  Once everyone took a piece, there were 2 left.   We asked for more bread, waited awhile and nothing happened.   Our salads finally came in an awkward way, with one server delivering salads and the other handing out small containers of salad dressing.  The salad was just bagged salad with one cherry tomato and one slice of cucumber.  We again asked for bread, so our server (Mary) walked over to another table and asked if they were going to eat their bread and since they said no, she brought it to us.   Do I need to say HEALTH CODE VIOLATION?  We couldn't believe it.

Food finally started coming out, and of course all other tables were half done eating before ours came out.  5 people at our table had steak and the server didn't know how the steaks were cooked and just started handing them out.   One guest had prepared her baked potato with butter and sour cream, and then cut her steak and ate a piece and said that it was well done and she wanted medium.   The server took her plate to the other end of the table and told that guest that they needed to switch plates.  When told about the potato, she took a fork and picked up the steak and told the guest to switch it with the other one.   OMG! I can't believe this happened in a restaurant.  My salmon was bland, the vegetables were stone cold and the baked potato was only warmish.  My husband had ordered the pork chop and his meal wasn't delivered until we were 80% done with our meals.   We twice asked the server where his meal was and instead of being apologetic, she announced that it wasn't her fault,  but the kitchens fault.  Again, OMG, this isn't really happening.  

We asked if there were any dessert choices because we weren't offered any as they just brought our check.   Our server yelled over to the other server to tell us the desserts.   They clearly didn't want us to order dessert, coffee, or drinks.   Who does that???????

My husband had enough and went and spoke to the manager, who apologized, recognized there were health code violations and said he would talk to the server.   To top it all off, there was a mandatory gratuity.  This server deserved nothing with her awful attitude and service.  The manager would do nothing for us and has totally lost any future business from us, our family and friends, as we will be sure to spread the word.

Run away as fast as you can."}
{"text":"Have visited this fine restaurant many times in the past 6 months. Great food and great service. Place is a little old looking, but it's part of it's charm. Everything that I have ordered was great. Appetizers are great. Entrees and sides are great. No problems at all. Place is kind of quaint with white linen table cloths. Not really a family place for kids. Mostly for adults looking for a quiet dinner out without the kids or retired couple enjoying each other's company. Great place with great food and great time."}
{"text":"Disgusted! Waitress (using this dated term due to the clientele) greeted us by spilling water and ice on table, then threw the ice on the floor! Inquired on the number of scallops that accompany the dish with angel hair. The response: \"there's enough!\"  Really??  I walked out and will never return!"}
{"text":"We came in after reading all the great reviews and we're not disappointed! We ordered Prime rib, Rib eye and a Shrimp and pasta dish. All we're great and the portions large. The server was friendly and very accommodating.

Only advice I could offer the owners would be to reconsider some of the interior decorations, but it's still very nice! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Why the low rating? I don't know where to begin. My wife and I joined a group in our community who once a month organize a dinner at a different restaurant. We know, from both personal and professional experience, that large group dining is a challenge for restaurants and those dining. We recognize that the service may be a little slower than normal and there can be confusion. To mitigate this, as it often the case for large group dining, our group of nearly 30 pre-ordered our entrées from a selection of four items.

Seated at a table of 8, as luck would have, it we were the last to place drink orders and to confirm our entrée orders. When (almost) all of the entrées at our table were served, the kitchen failed to mark the temperatures on each of the steak entrées. When one person cut their steak and took a bite she told our server that steak was cooked to a medium well temp and she ordered medium. Another person at our table cut her steak and said that it was cooked medium and not medium well. 

RATHER THAN TAKE BOTH PATRONS PLATES BACK TO THE KITCHEN AND WITHOUT DISCUSSION, THE SERVER PULLED THE PLATE OUT FROM UNDER THE FORMER PERSON, TOOK IT TO THE LATTER PERSON AND USED THE PATRON'S FORK TO SWITCH STEAKS!!! 

AFTER HAVING REQUESTED MORE BREAD TWICE, WITH NONE DELIVERED, WE REMINDED OUR SERVER, AT WHICH POINT SHE WENT TO ANOTHER TABLE AND ASKED IF THEY NEEDED THEIR UNEATEN BREAD AND SET DOWN AT OUR TABLE!! 

THAT IS TWO STATE HEALTH CODE VIOLATIONS!! 

Oh, and my entrée was only delivered after everyone in our entire group had eaten half of their meal. My vegetables were cold and the baked potato was half cooked. When I expressed my dissatisfaction to my server she uttered not a word of apology, but rather said \"this is not my fault, it is the kitchen's fault.\" 

To add insult to injury, there was an automatic gratuity of 15% added to the bill!,

When I brought all this to the attention to the manager his reply was that he was very upset by the actions of the server and that he would deal with it. However, he did not so much as to even offer to waive the gratuity charge!"}
{"text":"Mahle's is a restaurant in Westlake on Detroit Rd. that has been around since maybe as early as the 70's.  It caters to an older crowd and probably not so much the Milennials.  It appears that the customers are long time regulars that the employees are familiar with.

Went here on Easter with my mother who wanted prime rib.  Called in advance and they did have prime rib. As we entered the restaurant, it appeared relatively dated, and looked like it had not been remodeled since it opened decades ago.  After a few moments we were seated in the dining room and given menus.

The menu was an abbreviated menu for Easter that had American and some Italian entrees, all of them pretty standard dishes.  The one exception was the Italian sausage stuffed pepper as an appetizer.  Entrees included chicken parmesan, veal parmesan, filet, NY strip, and lamb chops.

My mother and I both ordered the same dish.  Prime rib, side salad, and baked potato.  Presentation of everything was excellent and there was only a short wait for food.  My big disappointment was that the prime rib needed more salt.  I also noticed we were the only ones in the dining room eating the prime rib, so maybe that was not one of they're specialities.

Based on the rest of the customers, it seems like most are highly satisfied with the food and are regulars.  Wait staff was seasoned and efficient. Unfortunately because of the prime rib, I only give it 3.5 stars, possibly we ordered something that they are not seasoned in preparing.  Based on other entrees that I saw coming out of the dining room and other Yelp reviews, I plan to return and check out some other menu items."}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff and quiet environment. Big portions too! Perfect for a date night or family dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my parents here for an anniversary celebration Saturday night.  They accommodated us without reservations. All of us were extremely happy with the experience!  

Dishers ordered that evening were Veal Parmesan, Chicken Marsala and Chicken Florentine (minus the tomatoes).  There was fresh bread with soft butter and salads for everybody.  We did utilize the bar and we had dessert.  I must say, the cheesecake was one of the best, if not the best, cheesecake I have had out and about.  

Our waitress was a gem; helpful and attentive.  The place was decorated for Christmas and was lovely. The bill for four of us was very reasonable even with drinks and desserts.  We will not hesitate to return... And soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & service.  We were definitely the youngest customers in the place but that was ok with me. I wasn't there to socialize.  Everyone was extremely friendly & even talked with us like we were family.  I will definitely return & highly recommend."}
{"text":"Quality 4/5
Service 5/5
ambiance 5/5
Value 4.5/5

I've come here twice and will be coming again if I get sent out from California again. 
The quality here is pretty good. The blackened walleye is cooked well. The texture isn't too dry or too raw - just right. The flavour is rich on the side of salty. If salty ain't your thang just brush off some of the blackened part and you're good. 
The second time I've been here I had the porterhouse veal. It was delicious w the red wine sauce. My only complaint was there wasn't more, but I probably couldn't have finished it if there was anyways. 
The garlic butter noodles were amazing. It's not overly garlic or overly buttery until you get to the last few bites. Think of it like ice cream, the last few bites are blanketed in sauce. 
The house salad was a typical salad mix but their sweet and sour dressing was good. It wasn't rich or creamy like thousand island, but rather consistency of vinaigrette. It was light and sweet flavour like watered down honey mustard so was a great way to whet my appetite for the actual meal. 
Oh. The bread. It comes w a light whipped butter. 
I love ice cream. Their ice cream pie dessert is great as well. The picture is of the chocolate, but I had both chocolate and coconut. I'd say the coconut is better (less of a fan of chocolate and cool whip and more of a coconut crumble). I don't know how exactly to describe it other than delicious. Think light ice cream pie w a crumbling crust. 

The waitresses (Maureen) and owner (Beverly) were the epitome of midwestern hospitality. I came from out of state and stood out like a sore thumb. They were welcoming and you can have a decent genuine conversation. My second time back they remembered me and everything (a week and a half in between). Extremely friendly staff. 

The place feels like home almost. Actually more like grandmas house for a thanksgiving dinner. It's warm and inviting with some homey touches around (old photos and chimney for one). 

Meals were not the cheapest but you pay for the quality. Fresh catch fish + a glass of wine + dessert will run you around $35. Not too bad in the grand scheme of it all and you'll leave full. I left feeling like I ate 25 McNuggets after everything."}
