{"text":"Really taste and worth the price. I loved ceviche and beef heart skewer. Waitresss was very kind too. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I promise you, come to this restaurant and try their ceviche and the calamari. It is the best ceviche I have had since being in Peru. When you sit down people come into the restaurant saying hello in Spanish, you can hear Spanish music coming from the kitchen with every flavourfull bite you take. Not a fancy restaurant, but it is authentic and please try the ceviche. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food! Love their ceviche and their cau cau tastes just like my grandmother used to make!! Every visit does not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  The decor is very basic here but the food and friendliness of the staff surely made up for it.  The pescado a lo macho was divine.  The Sudado de Pescado was also very good if you want a lighter, healthier meal.  The calamari appetizer was light and fresh.  Getting the food once ordered way a bit slow thus the four stars.  Waaaaay better restaurant than El Fogon."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! Looking forward to coming back! Highly recommend hitting up this new Peruvian restaurant! :)"}
{"text":"Not good at all! Peruvian food is my favorite kind and this one was definitely not good I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The staff was really nice though"}
{"text":"I loved this place. It's a small, authentic restaurant. Went with my peruvian friend and she said the atmosphere was just like a restaurant in Peru."}
{"text":"Great Peruvian restaurant! Very good tamales and the empanadas are just like if they were made in Peru! I have been here for breakfast and another time for lunch. Wasn't disappointed in any of them"}
{"text":"Great peruvian authentic food at a fair price. Neighborhood is not the best but there is a supermarket nearby where you can park. Just walk a couple of blocks and you are there. Good service. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Everything was so good! I did an office catering to downtown and Luisa helped me organize everything including drinks, delivery. We ordered: ceviche  aji de gallana  lomo saltado  seco de carne  causita de pollo  chicharron  tamales  papa a la huancaina  jalea crema volteada   Everyone really liked the cream volteada (very creamy!). Aji de gallina, and ceviche as well. The seco de carne was cleared in no time.    They were very nicely packaged so it was very smooth after receiving the food in downtown.   I would love to come to the restaurant soon and try the food fresh from the kitchen.   Thank you for the kind suggestions, delivery, and great food!"}
{"text":"Peruvian here. We love this place. I come here once a week, sometimes more lol The food is just how we eat back at home, including the presentation. It's delicious home made food. I don't go there for the decor, just the delicious food. It's a family run restaurant."}
{"text":"Good ceviche. Great service and reasonable prices. They can do a better job with their fries and some of the other dishes. Ask for the special Peruvian drinks they make in house."}
