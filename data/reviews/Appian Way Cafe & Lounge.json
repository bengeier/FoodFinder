{"text":"Sam makes one of the best pizzas around. Highly recommend the Cajun bacon pizza. Wings are great too"}
{"text":"Best wings in the area no doubt about it!!!  The bartenders are totally awesome.  I walked into the place once and from then on they knew my drink.  Wing night is Wednesday. $.35 wings.  Try the dry rub or garlic wings.  Absolutely the very best for 20 miles radius."}
{"text":"Ordered...tenders, wings, steak hoagie. Took 1 hour to bring to us. Had to leave at that point. Credit card slips came out messed up and couldn't see the total correctly. Wasn't compensated in any way...had to pay for everything.  Wings had wrong flavor. Tenders were plain and ordered mild.   Horrible experience. This is a BAR...not a cafe. Misleading!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this is a dive bar in the quintessential definition of dive bars so if you look at this review and rating going in with the knowledge that this is explicitly a dive bar....then you'll  understand where the rating is coming from.   They have cheap drinks, cheap food, pronounced yinzer accents and great atmosphere if you can see through the cigarette smoke. The cheese logs are homemade, the burgers are done appropriately, the drinks are strong, the pizza is tasty. Is it Altius??? No. And it's not supposed to be. It's perfectly UN perfect... just the way you want it."}
{"text":"Max makes the best parmesan garlic wings, EVER!  They are crispy and tasty and bring me back here time and time again."}
