{"text":"Update: the owner retired and sold his business to new owners sometime in 2014...I went back and was dismayed to find the prices higher and the quality lower. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten fish since I was about 12 years old and my mom used to make us eat those frozen fish sticks.  A few weeks ago I went here because my coworker and I were hungry and stressed out and we wanted something fried = comfort food.  As many of you may see from other places I have reviewed, I work in the Marlee and Lawrence area, which is not known for its culinary options.  Or any options, really.  So you take what you can get...  This location has had many different bars/grills/dives in it, so when it became a fish and chips place, I didn't really notice.  It is a bit of a dive, but their menu is quite large and they have a liquor license!  For the Fish and Chips options you can have: Haddock, Cod, Salmon, Halibut, Shrimp, Scallops and Calamari.  They also have fish fingers and chips, fish burgers, sides, chips/fritters (which include sweet potato fritters and zucchini fritters), and more fishy things!  For my first time eating fish in over twenty years, I went with the Haddock fish and chips.  I have to say, it was incredibly greasy, but tasty!  My colleague agreed.  And the portions were huge and reasonably priced priced.    I would only eat here because of its proximity to my office and because I don't love the food court at Lawrence Square.  I will never be found here on a weekend, a date, or even most weekday lunch times.  But for my first fish eating experience since the early '90's, it was so good!"}
{"text":"For a fish and chip joint, this one ok.  Service is fast, food is good with no complaint, just a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Sue: First time here. The owners are friendly and really lovely but the food is average. Undercooked more than anything. The fish batter is rather floury and rubbery. I love the fact that the fries are home made but they were undercooked as well. It was edible but the onion rings were also undercooked and greasy so we couldn't finish them.  Steve: Sue picked up, so didn't experience the owners, but the food was definitely sub-par. Fish and onion rings had the same pale, undercooked, grease saturated batter. Distinct lack of flavour, even the fish (Cod). At 7.99 for the onion rings (seriously?), we expected much more. Possibly the friers are set too low. The fries were soft and undercooked as well. Double fried like many fish shops would have been great. Tartar sauce was disappointingly the cheap mass produced packets and the coleslaw was flaccid and lacked flavour. Given the other positive reviews, it's possible it was an off night, so we may try again."}
{"text":"Finding good F&C seems to be a very hard thing lately.  I used to be a big fan of Bentley's at Yonge & lawrence, but they have now been gone for years.  On a whim my friend aand I decided to pop in and it was definitely worth the stop.  The fish was nice and crisp (all fish is wild catch canadian) and the fries were yummie.  The slaw was over mayo'd but that may have been the batch. The place was nice, clean and the staff very friendly.  Will be popping in here again for sure"}
{"text":"Earns 4/5 stars as it is great for what it tries to be...a simple, clean, really fresh fish & chips place. It would get 5 stars but it is actually pricey for the top quality Halibut fish. Located in a dumpy strip mall, the restaurant has a nice patio and is very clean inside with a modern fish restaurant design. The menu is quite large given everything they offer is deep fried. Plus they make great real ice cream milkshakes."}
