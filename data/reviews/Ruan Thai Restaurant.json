{"text":"We've never made it down to dine in at Ruan Thai but we've ordered it for delivery many, many times and we have never been disappointed.  Our standard order is coconut rice (we always order an extra container since it's so good), red curry chicken, green curry vegetables and beef with basil.  I can't speak to it's authenticity but the food is incredibly flavourful, with lots of meat and veggies. I hate when restaurants skimp on the meat and fill you up with veggies and this has never been a problem when we order from Ruan Thai. We order our food mild, but I have no doubt they know how to turn up the heat for those who like things spicier. The first time we ordered medium and it was too much for my whimpy taste buds. Even the beef with basil has been spicier than I'm used to, but SO good.  We have also ordered the drunkard noodles with chicken once, and they were great - but at almost $17/order - a little too pricey.  A bonus for me is that they know how to prepare things gluten-free and I am completely comfortable ordering from them.  Sure, it's probably more expensive than the average Thai place, which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars - but it's good, doesn't take long to arrive and gluten-free."}
{"text":"We ordered Ruan Thai through dial a waiter; overall it was very good.  We had the drunkard noodles with tofu, vegetarian panang curry with tofu, and fresh salad rolls.  We requested that the fish sauce be  left out of the 2 dishes and for the shrimp to be left out of the rolls.  I was very happy to see that our request was accommodated; but the drunken noodles arrived and had egg in them (which was not noted on their menu). Just a note for other vegans out there :). Overall, very yum!  We will definitely get takeout from Ruan Thai again."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey but very tasty (~$20 per dish).  We were there 6:30pm on a Saturday night and were surprised that we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Two people came in for pickup but other than that my wife and I had the restaurant to ourselves.  Service was polite and quick.  Food was delicious. Atmosphere = so-so"}
{"text":"Ruan Thai has the absolute best Thai food I have tasted in Calgary.  The service comes with a bit of attitude, but as long as they bring me the beef with lime leaves, I'll let it slide!"}
{"text":"The good: The food was excellent. The bad: Very over-priced, staff not knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I've gotten take-out and delivery from Waiters En Route - overall, I've been pretty happy with the food.  The pad thai is yummy - I find it hard to get a good pad thai in Calgary.  Their yellow curry is also delicious!"}
{"text":"After driving by Ruan Thai many times finally decided to give it a shot tonight. And it was a waste of ammo.  We were seated for at least 10 minutes before we even had menus and  water.  After I perused the menu I noticed that the prices were much higher than most other Thai restaurants ($15-$25 per dish) I frequent.  Our food arrived fairly quickly and to Ruan Thai's credit, it was good. However, we ran out of water during the meal and it was never replenished.  Then, we had to walk to the front counter and wait another 10 minutes for our bill. The waitress apologized, explaining that there were only the 2 servers and that once the restaurant and take-out orders piled up they had to help out in the kitchen. Understood, but this seemed like an unfortunately common occurrence.  Combine that with the fact that two salad rolls ($5 each!), a curry and coconut rice for two came to $30 and unless I have lots of time and someone else is paying, I'll go elsewhere for Thai."}
{"text":"I've \"been\" to Ruan Thai twice. Well, not really.   See, I've walked in their door once and ordered takeout another time. But let's not get stuck up on semantics, shall we? Just know that I can't comment on service as others have.  The first time I went, we went to take out their lunch buffet. They were woefully prepared for 4 hungry men to violently burst in their door demanding spring rolls and noodles. So, we had to wait a few minutes before the food came out. A bummer - but fear not, lunch wasn't \"Ruan\"ed. (Come for the review, stay for the comedy. I'm here all day, folks).   Still, it became clear that Ruan had low expectations for themselves and didn't believe they were worthy of a lunch rush. Come on guys, buck up!  On the whole I was underwhelmed this first visit. Spring rolls were fresh, the spicy beef was flavorful if not a bit tough and the lemongrass chicken was just okay. Whatever noodles I had were greasy. I didn't think I'd be back, but then Ruan got the chance to redeem themselves when my boss ordered in for our Friday lunch meeting.  The take out was much, MUCH better than the in-restaurant buffet experience. We had Pad Thai, that same beef dish, spring rolls, rice, chicken in a pineapple type sauce, a curry dish and one or two more. The Pad Thai was great and much less greasy than whatever noodles I had the time before.  THIS was much better, probably because they had a chance to prepare.   Is it high on my take out list? Well, no. (See my review of Peking Garden in the NW for a REALLY great place). But as far as Thai goes, is it a passable lunch alternative?  SURE! If that doesn't sound like a standing ovation, it's not. But I won't recommend against trying it and finding out for yourself."}
{"text":"Passed by Ruan Thai and decided to pop in for a quick dinner.  We have not eaten at Ruan Thai for such a long time.   Parking is a problem at this restaurant.  There are maybe 4 spots right in front of the restaurant and on-the-street parking when it's possible.    We ordered the Stuffed Chicken Wings, comes with a sweet dipping sauce.  Yummy!  We also ordered the Vege Pad Thai and the Vege Drunken Rice Noodles (why vege 'cos it was cheaper than the other noodle dishes), and the Pineapple Fried Rice.  Really, the dishes at Ruan Thai are seriously overpriced.    I gave it a 3 star eventhough it was overpriced 'cos the food quality is good.  Ask for their hot sauce.  Adds some firepower to your food.    Would I come back again?  Sure, but not very soon...unless they reduce their prices.  Might come back and try their buffet....way later..."}
