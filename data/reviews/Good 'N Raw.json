{"text":"Went here to get some food for lunch. They have two specific times a day you can order food and two ~30min windows to pick up. But then they do have dry foods and some stuff in a fridge too. Got the burger, tuna salad sandwich, pizza kale chips, brain tonique drink and Superfood shake. It The burger was so crumbly. All those ingredients in it are ground up and you may as well get out a fork/spoon and eat it that way. The tuna salad was alright. Kale chips were very very bad tasting to me and the bf. But probably good to someone who likes that kinda stuff. The Brain Tonique drink was good but I didn't feel smarter. The Superfood Shake was really really good. Definitely can taste the banana. Tastes like a chocolate covered banana but with even more flavors lurking that I can't put my finger. Doubt I will go back though.was just ok. And all that was $31."}
{"text":"Love it! I am so happy there are more options for places to eat in cleveland. Cant wait to visit the wellness center"}
{"text":"I still love Good 'N Raw!  I went there today for lunch and to stock up on some raw food supplies!  Their little store has more and more raw products each time I make a trip there!  You'll find products you can't find anywhere else around town!"}
{"text":"When Juan S. said it is \"Raw Food Heaven\" he was right!!!

A friend introduced me to this place and I couldn't believe how much l actually liked it!
I tend to eat pretty healthy but I know I can do better- this place gave my diet some major gluten free raw brownie points lol
I tried a smoothie with 

When I say this place is healthy- I mean this place is healthy and not for the fast food lovers. Anyone can love a yummy fruit smoothie- way better than Jamba Juice- aka wayyy less sugar- but not anyone can love or appreiate Raw Food- wht that in mind I would ween those who are not used to this type of good eats with something simple- then baby steps to more healthy foods. 

For those who are already vegan or vegitarian, hek even a meat lover like me but try to eat healthy- check this place out!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a raw food heaven. There's a great selection of products at the store to purchase. The kale chips are amazing with different flavors. The menu is simple and is take out only. They make some amazing raw veggie burger along with the yummy smoothies. The juice combination is great too.

They also have a setup on Shaker Square Farmers' Market every Sat morning. They sell the Kale chips, granola and energy bars.

Good advise is call ahead and place your order. Someone recomended to us. You don't have to wait for the food."}
{"text":"This place no longer has a cafe or juice bar. I stopped in on my way to Cleveland, and was disappointed. Their small store is nice, but nothing extraordinairy if you have a Whole Foods or Co-op in your town. I did buy some of their Kale Chips- which were excellent!"}
