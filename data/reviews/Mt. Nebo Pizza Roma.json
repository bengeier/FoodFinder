{"text":"Pretty good pizza and a great selection of subs.  The wings are fantastic... always friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"After numerous times ordering from these guys on MtNebo I had to write a review. It's a true experience for dinner with them. I PREFER to pick up, just to get the full \"cheers\" experience. All of the guys are so friendly and the food is consistently good. You need to anticipate ordering or plan to wait if you're going to do delivery, but even their delivery guys are a delight! Thanks guys, I highly recommend some great, old fashioned, tasty pizza. In the words of my 7YO, \"this is way bette than Dominos\"."}
{"text":"Inconsistent quality, delivery is super-undependable.  One time it's 15 minutes early, others (like today), it's over 45 minutes late.  Doesn't seem like a manager is ever on duty."}
{"text":"OK, to all of you pizza snobs who are apparently SO self-righteous about a freaking pizza... I have ALSO lived in Boston, New York City & (enjoyed a brief eight-month stay) in Chicago.   Would I order dominoes? Rather eat garbage. Papa John's? Gross, plastic pizza . Eh, rather than get in to the ins & outs of all this, I think the people who didn't like this pizza need to get a life! Pizza Roma (I'm only speaking of Mt Nebo, now... Not a fan of the one on perry hwy) is so much better than any chain (which is ALL we have in pittsburgh, pizza snobs!).   Every time I serve this pizza to people who have only had Vocelli's, they go crazy for how good it is. Is it as good as what you can get in new York? No. This is Pittsburgh & I only know if ONE good Thai place (Red Orchid on Babcock), ONE good Chinese place (China palace on mcknight Rd - I know that sounds & it does look like a gross buffet on the outside, but it's all homemade from REAL ingredients!), ONE good Indian place (Taj Mahal on mcknight Rd- & I went to Carnegie Mellon! So I know good Indian!) & finally ONE good pizza place.   The people who left these bad reviews must be out-of-towners. You're not in new York, you're in pittsburgh... & not even! You're 10 miles north of the city! I lived downtown after CMU & this is STILL the best pizza in pittsburgh. Sorry if you prefer plastic, chemical cheese pizza or fresh new York city pizza. Either way, you can only get ONE of those options in pittsburgh (it's the chemical option...),except for Mt Nebo Pizza Roma. And it's the closest to the other that you'll get in pittsburgh!

{"text":"I've had generally good experiences with the food here. But the ordering process recently has been a hot dumpster fire. The person taking the order can't remember to ask for the phone number or the name or both! So when we go to pick it up, they haven't made the food. So then we have to awkwardly stand there and waste 15-20 minutes of our lives, waiting for what should have already been done. Is it too hard to comp your customers for your mistakes? The employees seem to be having the time of their lives talking about Jay and Silent Bob, but ignoring the satisfaction of their customers. These were on orders between $40 and $50 and not on extremely busy nights. I'm done with Pizza Roma. I'll buy my pies somewhere else from now on. Once the boys behind the counter pay more attention to detail, I might be back...."}
{"text":"Their pizza is ok.....but they cannot get any of their hoagies right, most especially the buffalo chicken hoagie. And tonight, after their third screwup, I called to let them know....the response from the manager was \"what would you like me to do about it?\"  Thats not quite the right response in my book.  Lived here 20 years....Im now a \"lost customer\"."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this pizza for many years. The pizza from today was the most bland pizza I've ever had. No seasoning and the cheese must be a lower grade quality cheese. Not cool. I understand controlling food costs but not at the expense of your quality. Now I'm looking for another pizzeria. I won't be back. Sorry. The pizza was terrible. With customers, one screwup will ruin your product and destroy your customer base."}
{"text":"Whoever is giving this place a good review must be friends with the owners. I live very close to this location and want to like it but it is just not possible. Abundantly clear that this food was made without pride or anything resembling quality ingredients.   People can say pizza snob if they want but if people don't speak up when poor food like this is sold then things never improve and places like this will continue to serve the lowest quality food at the highest possible cost with their only concern making the highest possible profit.   I'd like to hear an owner or manager respond to this. One of the worst pizzas I've ever had and that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"We just moved to Diamond Run and ordered this for the movers/unpackers and the family. The pizza was good. It would have been better with more pepperoni. I would disagree with some of the negative reviews.  Now, it's not as good as Cafe Milano's or Giovanni's downtown but it's good."}
{"text":"The food was really bad. We ordered a sandwich and the bread was soggy. It tasted weird too. The cheese triangles we ok bit tue sauce was really watery. When you eat the pizza, when you are kinda close to the crust, the cheese falls off! I do not recommend them. It was not good."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, the breadsticks were really greasy, the wings were just so so and we got overcharged for our order.  Overall not a good experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am a former Pittsburgher and this used to be my place to go for a quick sandwich or pizza. Pizza Roma Mt. Nebo is the place I always have to go to get my steak and cheese sub. Fantastic food!!!!! Food it always made to order with fresh products. Great friendly staff. Can not say enough good things about this place. I always look forward to getting a steak and cheese sub. I have had subs, hoagies, and bombers depending on which part of the country I am in...but nothing compares to Pizza Roma in Ohio Township."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome! The sauce has a good flavor and a little kick to it and goes perfect with the homemade ranch. The sandwiches are really good too and I always appreciate homemade food especially when it comes to pizza. The service is always on point whether you get delivery or pick up. The guys are super friendly and will make you feel welcome!!"}
{"text":"New to the area, I saw this place on the road and decided to give it a try.   For some reason, I am finding good NY Style pizza a hard find in PA.  I walked into the restauarant and saw a police officer who was quietly waiting on his order.   Police officers usually know the good establishments since they are really the \"local\" road warriors - so it immediately passed the first test.  There is no dine in area - ths place is really for pick-up / or derlivery.  You have about 10'feet (within that 10feet - you encounter a cash machine, the soda fridge, a TV and some flyers before you reach a counter.  Behind the counter in a very tight space you see 8 guys feverishly making pizze, subs, calzones, etc...  The atmosphere was hilarious - the guys were teasing each other while they were pushing out pies and subs.  My order was made in less than 15 minutes - which was nice because there was no sitting area.      I ordered a Pep and Mushroom Pizza and their Italian Sub.  Food - Very good - the best pizza I have had in PA.    Ingredients seemed fresh.  The crust was thin - which is what I prefer.   They do a variety of styles including Chicago.  I also ordered an italian sub.     This was very good - there was a lot of meat on this kid .   The bun - can't really describe it but actually was my favorite part.  Overall:  Service - (Pick-up) It was great.   They guys helped make my wait enjoyable (just listening to them teasing each other).   Price:   PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A CASH / CHECK PLACE ONLY   My pizza and sub was $21 Atmoshphere - No waiting area / Not a restaurant - it was what it is (my Yogi Berra- like saying of the day)   I found my local pizza shop.  Life is right once again!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent quality. Sometimes it's decent sometimes it's absolute garbage. After my last experience I won't be returning.  Food safety is a foreign concept to these guys."}
{"text":"Save you money the food is not good. There is a reason they only have 2 1/2 stars. At one time their food was good but not anymore. There is way better pizza in the area that delivers."}
