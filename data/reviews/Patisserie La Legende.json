{"text":"Not the best, not the worst of its kind. La Legende hosts a variety of buns, bubble tea, and pastries. 

Middle of the road: I tried the chicken bun (the fact that they had a chicken bun was actually  a huge bonus in my book). It was ok, it was fried and obviously so- it was too greasy for my taste and could've used more chicken. It was a Sunday AM and they were running out of quite a few items, some which I wanted to try. 

We also tried the bubble tea- my friends had the almond and the milk tea, which were pretty run of the mill. Overall, not bad to stop by if you're in a pinch (like we were as many other spots were closed before 11 AM!). 

The pluses: they were open early and they accepted credit cards (huge if you're pretending to conduct business in the 21st century)."}
{"text":"Great pastries at reasonable prices. The interior is very lovely, a nicer bakery. I love their vanilla sponge cakes, so huge and very cheap. Great noodle dishes as well. Reminds me of the bakeries in Flushing and Chinaown, NY. Really great bakery, extremely cheap."}
{"text":"Found this place while walking around Chinatown there was a lot people at the business so I thought this had to be place. The pastries were good also the sausage in a roll. The food was very fresh but please stick to the pastries. I ordered some food from the restaurant part. I ordered General Tso chicken, spicy chicken fried rice. O.k. here we go the food was bad in so many ways. The rice was overcooked and under seasoned way under seasoned.  Our idea of spicy is definitely different. The General Tso chicken was soggy the veggies were boiled so long until it was mush would I go back Oh No!!!!!!! They received  1 star only because I had to do this review will post."}
{"text":"Visited the bakery last evening.Ordered 35 bucks worth food for takeout and were asked to be seated while we waited for our order (there was plenty of vacant seating).Suddenly,we have this extremely rude waitress come up to us and tell us to \"get up,I need the table\"..when we politely tried to explain,she cut us off saying \"I don't care,I need the table\"..we tried asking the other staff for her name, and the manager/owners phone number,but were denied both..We've seen this waitress do this to another customer in the past, and it's shocking that the owners let her get away with it (possibly because the staff seems to be so protective of her that the complaints never reach the owner)..As much as we like the bakery, we don't see ourselves visiting again.."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here for a late night snack.  I ordered the BBQ noodle soup.  The noodles were kind of like instant noodles out of a package of noodles that you can buy at any supermarket, and the BBQ pork did not taste good.  

My fiance ordered pastry only. She ordered an elongated pastry with whipped cream running down tge length of it and two don tots (egg custard pastry).  The elongated pastry tasted great.  The don tot tasted so so.

I only had one dish, and it was not good, but their pastries tasted okay.  Their waitresses were average at best.  They did their jobs, but they were not very friendly.

If I went back here again, I would only go back to try their different pastries."}
{"text":"We were super hungry after a session of badminton and happened to walk by Chinatown. We went for La Legende because I remembered they offer large portion for good price. 
I went for some satay chicken and rice. My friend took noodles and pork meat. It came with TEA :D (thumbs up)
I was so hungry. The food tasted good and filled me up. BIG PORTION omg. Nice plates.
The couches are nice and comfy. Nice atmosphere. I didn't feel rush.
You can also buy pastry if you're hungry or take it to go.
Definitely coming back if I feel hungry for quality/price food."}
{"text":"A-OK? Maybe more like OK.  My review is based on the Hokkaido bun and custard tartlet though some of the other desserts were okay.  The Hokkaido bun was somewhat doughy and tasted like yeasty undercooked dough.  I could not get beyond the first bite.  The custard tarlet that someone else in our traveling group said it was dry and overcooked.  I have to say that if we didn't get these two things, my rating would have been A-OK.  One of cakes that we also bought had a good spongy texture, though I think the colors of each of its three layers suggested flavors that were not really there) and the sesame ball was not greasy and had a good chewy consistency.  Just be ready to have some ups and downs."}
{"text":"The ladies here don't have any time for your lip!  However, they do make a bangin' bubble tea here for a decent price.  My favorite is the Lemon Green Tea, and I ask for less sugar.  I recommend asking for less sugar and you will find that you cab taste the beverage flavor.

Once they had cookies that were made with XO sauce, so I just had to buy them.  They tasted exactly like super sweet XO sauce.  In case you don't know what that would taste like,  it is sweet dried seafood with a strong dark soy taste.  It was pretty bad, but I just had to give it a whirl. 

They also have full entrees of Hong Kong style diner foods here, like stew on rice and curry chicken on rice.  I will definitely hit up the HK diner menu next time we are in town."}
{"text":"We went in for the bubble tea but decided to dine instead. We ordered a type of chicken flat noodles which was initially only available with beef but they were nice enough to do chicken instead. Great customer service. We got green tea and mango bubble tea and they were both good, maybe not the best however. The food however was great. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed numerous Chinese cafes in Hong Kong and Toronto.  I was skeptical about this one at first as Montreal is not known for their Chinese food.  This place pleasantly surprised me.

I have ordered the crispy pork chop with rice here, as well as black pepper beef with fried spaghetti.  Both are dericious!

Lots of foot traffic comes in to buy the bakery, even at 9-10pm on weeknights.
Cannot beat the cafes in Hong Kong or Toronto, but very acceptable if you are looking for Chinese food in Montreal. Likely the best in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Great food, would definitely come back however I think they need more staff. All staffs seemed too busy when I ask for napkins, water etc. They seem super stressed. The bread in this bakery is good. I had a few while waiting for my entrees. I came here two three times. I had congee (which I definitely recommend-also a breakfast combo) and I also had their baked pasta and rice. I wouldn't recommend those because I had better baked rice/pasta in NY but overall, I had a good experience here."}
{"text":"I've been here at least twice, and both times consistently 'meh'. The buns were fine, but the bubble tea was way too sweet. I asked if it was possible to get black tea in my mango flavored bubble tea (which, as one would expect, often contains actual TEA), and the person working there snidely replied \"Umm no, we don't put tea in juice\" as if I was making an unreasonable request. So basically they don't serve bubble tea, they serve juice, according to their staff.

Also, questions regarding sanitation. I asked someone working there where I could find some tongs, and she pointed to a pile of dirty one grouped together on a counter. Those were the only tongs available.

My suggestion: go to Harmonie or L2 for real (and good) bubble tea, and Harmonie has great pastries without the attitude. Not sure what the point of being rude is when you have so much competition 2 doorstops away! It just pisses people off and makes their dining experience unpleasant. Why would you want your restaurant to be associated with that? Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great selection of pastries, I tried the sesame ball, the cream bun, and the three type bun (red bean, green bean, and coconut). The servings are very generous for the price, I've been to several Chinatowns on the East Coast and this one seems to have the cheapest bakeries so far. I also had an almond bubble tea, the tapioca was a little hard and the tea wasn't the greatest, so I recommend going elsewhere if you need a beverage."}
{"text":"Excellent variety of delicious pastries at very good prices. In NYC the items we purchased would have been at least 4 times as expensive and half as good. Everything we got was tasty and I was amazed by the prices as well. We will definitely go back here earlier in the day next time as they were out of some things we wanted to try by the end of the evening."}
{"text":"Strolling along with some of my female friends of mine in Montreal's unique flavor Chinatown came across this Asian bakery, thought we would go ahead and try a light snack before we head out to the poutinefest; lol i know we are like piggies. Anyhow i bought this custard bun with a dry flakey surgary top on the bun, it was just terrible, old and dry tasting with maybe a teasespoon worth of custard inside the bun, i had buns before from across the street by the buffet they were much better. I guess we'll continue to walk pass this joint in the future."}
{"text":"We went here for a quick bubble tea before setting out for a stroll around Montreal.  Good selection of tea and an even better selection of baked goods.  We didn't get to try any sweets, unfortunately, but they all looked delicious.  There was a steady stream of people coming in and buying them - perhaps this is an indicator of good quality but I'm not sure.  Montreal's Chinatown is small and this looked like the only bakery on the block, so maybe people will just take what they can get."}
{"text":"Been to this place a lot of time to eat a snack in Chinatown and always loved it. I recommend the Vanilla Sponge Cake and the Chocolate Torsade. Also the best pastry shop in the Chinatown. They have bubble tea.

Beware of something. I paid my pastries and the cashier was going to give me te receipt, but a homeless women (I think she's homeless) tried to steal our bag. When the cashier and I saw this, we stealed the bag off the hand of the woman and the cashier gave me the bag. This is why i give 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise, the food is good."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to buy some mooncakes for the Autumn Festival. They had three varieties available: 
- $5 for a large mooncake, round, with red bean past filling and egg yolk
- $2.50 for two small mooncakes, square, with red bean paste filling
- $2.50 for two small mooncakes, round, with lotus filling

The mooncakes tasted good and the prices are not unreasonable.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Nice variety of pastries and the coffee is served hot in a nice mug. The dining area is beautiful and very clean. They also serve bubble tea and some rice and noodle dishes. So if you are with friends that are split between having a bite or a dessert, that's the place.

This can be an extra for some: They have a TV on asian channel. I kind of like to see the news from elsewhere in a different dialect and try to figure out what is happening. :3"}
{"text":"First time went on a lunch date there and it was busy but still very good defs try it out"}
{"text":"This place has a nice fancy french name. It had a lot of different Chinese pastries and buns. We bought a lot of different things to have and try and to have as a snack and breakfast. It was good and decent. You can compare it to like Fay Da in NYC."}
{"text":"Good Chinese bakery in Chinatown. I liked their pork buns so much I had to return before leaving Montreal. They have a nice assortment of both sweet and savory pastries. Though they also have  a sit down restaurant, seating space is available for those only purchasing from the bakery side."}
{"text":"Their buns and pastries are good, but the food in their restaurant section is below average and the employees are extremely rude! When we ate dinner there the service was terrible so we decided to tip them below the expected 15% and the employees yelled at us that tip wasn't included in the price. We reluctantly gave them more but we've never been back. Since then we just get buns from Harmonie or Callia which are on the same street."}
{"text":"The little egg cakes were super powdery even though they looked so cute wrapped up! The pineapple bun was ok...cha siew bun was hot but it wasn't spread out inside so just a huge clump in the middle. Coffee was good though (from a NY perspective)."}
{"text":"I have tried bubble tea from dozens of shops. However, the one I got from this shop had to be the worst. The bubbles were hard and the milk tea was SUPER bitter and watery. I can't speak to the quality of the pastries because I didn't try any."}
{"text":"This place has a French name, but a Csoul. It has a good selection of Chinese buns and pastries. For 1$, the chicken bun I had was warm and tasted as well as I expected.

They offer a large selection of teas and bubble teas that are as good as most places around.

The service is a bit below average and sometimes the place does not seem as clean as it could be."}
{"text":"Nice Chinese bakery. I only sampled their buns -- red bean, green bean, taro filling. Prices were decent (around $1 per bun, give or take some cents), and they were as good as the baked Chinese goods I get in San Francisco. I like their orange paper pastry cups--makes for cleaner removal compared to what I usually get. The thin paper I see in SF sometimes leaves residue on its bread once peeled off."}
{"text":"I like this place because you can sit down, in addition to selling buns they also have full meal options and bubble tea. I have only tried the baked goods which were all good with the exception of the mini egg tart that had almost no custard. 
They offer some choices that you cannot find at Harmony and their fried curry buns are absolutely lovely. They open very early but since they don't have a great turnover it's best to go early for higher quality. Their moon cakes are especially good and not over expensive and the service is the best that I have experienced on this street. 
Something else that I really like is that they sometimes put some of the sweet buns on the warm section at the back which makes them extra yummy so keep an eye out for that."}
{"text":"I went in with low expectations and I must say, it was not bad! We had items from their breakfast menu: 

- 2 fried eggs, sausage and buttered toast - comes with milk tea (or coffee) - the eggs were not as runny as I'd like, even though they were \"sunny side\" 
- congee with fried dough - doesn't come with tea/coffee

It was cheap and plenty of seats, OK bathrooms! 

We got egg tarts to go from the bakery across the street (Patisserie Harmonie) just to try things out."}
{"text":"No frills bakery/bubbletea/food spot in montreal's cute little chinatown. They have a huge assortment of baked goods and a big menu of food to
Choose from. Prices are very affordable and big portions. 

We tried their eggplant with ground pork and the salt and pepper porkchop and it was more than enough for 2 people. It totally hit the spot after walking around sightseeing. I opted for a hot taro bubble tea and enjoyed it very much. 

We didn't get any pastries from this location, but it all looked so delicious."}
{"text":"We just wanted a snack, an authentic Chinatown food experience, couldn't decide on a meal or dessert. This place offers both.  Nothing to look at. Like a cafeteria inside, but it's clean. They have many pastry offerings and a full menu as well. We went late so we could sit where we wanted and server took our order. Both the owner and our server very nice and helpful. Bubble tea was a new experience, which we all loved. Like a creamy fruit drink with a variety of flavors. We had 3: coconut, banana & strawberry. All delicious. Food we snacked on was pineapple fried rice, fried dumplings and dumpling soup. The portions were tremendous. The food was good. We are from New York, where we are not lacking for good Chinese food. This food was good. Not great, not bad. And you can also do takeout if you don't want to sit. Good place to grab a quick snack or meal. If you are looking for a nice place to dine in Chinatown, this is NOT it."}
{"text":"Although I have never tried their food and many poor reviews thx to their food. I am only rating the sweets and Bubble tea. My kids love this place for the bubble tea and my wife for the desserts."}
{"text":"No service, No receipts, No water, lack of waitresses. They give a different price depending on what race you are (if you speak chinese, its cheaper). They skimp out on taxes and their food is so fake chinese that it disgusts me.

Their bubbles.... I saw the owner put his hand it to stir around the tapioca a couple of times. Their bubble tea is a NO-GO. With so many other restaurants and bakerys, GO TO A BETTER !!!"}
{"text":"On trouve plusieurs sucreries, des tables avec banquettes, agreable senteur de sucré, café , thé , etc"}
{"text":"This bakery is located in Montreal's little Chinatown.  Arrived here late at night, and it was not our first choice.  The other bakery we went to was sold out of just about everything.  Patisserie La Legende still had plenty of good looking choices.

This is what we bought:

2/$1 mini egg tarts.  Great value and tasted pretty good.  (3 stars)

$1 regular size egg tarts.  Good value and tasted okay also.  (3 stars)

$1.30 Brioche custard filled buns.  Fair price for a decent bun.  (3 stars)

$1.30 Chinese beignets (donuts) on a skewer.  Not too bad.  ( 3 stars)

Taro drink is used with powder.  Boba did not taste fresh.  (2 stars)

The girl put our purchases in an oily stained box even after I told her not to the first time.  Well, at least it was the least stained box after looking at all the other plain white boxes they had.

I probably would not return here again in the future.  Although, they are cheaper than our favorite Chinese bakery in Montreal.....the quality and taste of their baked goods are just not as good.  Maybe their restaurant located in the back is better, though."}
