{"text":"Yeah, they do take out.  It's what you would expect.  We've ordered again.  There isn't a lot to say here.  Think \"stereotypical\" Chinese take out place.  Got it pictured in your mind yet?  Wait for it... ~poof~ welcome to Dragon.  The food is good, we've yet to have anything BAD... no, they are not going to win any Michelin stars but when you want Chinese take out, they deliver (well, not literally, a minor setback).  To be fair, the menu prices do seem to be one click higher than comparable take out, likely due to the monopoly on Munhall Dragon seems to enjoy.  Not so much that we won't and don't go back mind you, but it's noticeable.  I like the orange chicken.. its the one stand out item I've come across.  Not sickening sweet, right amount of heat, and definitely distinguishable from mall food court fare.  Give 'em a chance."}
{"text":"Not bad for neighborhood corner Chinese food. The Szechwan is not good. Too much...ketchup?? The wonton soup is good.  Very good curry chicken with onion and happy family.  Egg rolls are hit or miss. Sometimes they can be a little underdone.  Is this the best place? No...but it does the trick especially for a hangover cure."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it is about this place that I love so much. I have been eating here for probably 10 years now, and it NEVER disappoints. Its not fancy, its not unique, its not some fantastic restaurant, its a chinese takeout place. But it is delicious! Everything I have ever ordered is good. The general tsos, the chicken with broccoli, the beef with broccoli, the sweet n sour, the teriyaki, etc. etc. But the real treats are the egg rolls and the wonton soup. Their lunch specials are all six or seven bucks and are more than enough food for a big guy like myself. It is also always ready in 10-15 minutes.  Affordable, fast, and delicious."}
{"text":"So I moved to Pittsburgh from Los Angeles. I know I know I know! Anyway so theres absolutely no places in Homestead that delivered Chinese so I decided to walk down to the closest Chinese food/restaurant to my house.   The family that runs the restaurant is very friendly. I read a review about them on Google that said the  mom looks like she might want to cook you alive. Don't believe it!  On this visit I ordered the Steamed Dumplings(recommended by some reviewer on google...THAT LIAR) and the Vegetable Chow Fun. I generally enjoy steamed dumplings but these dumplings(too much dumpling little meat) werent so good. Theyll probably be sitting in my mini fridge tomorrow and I'll force myself to eat them when I have the munchies/starving to death. The Vegetable Chow Fun on the other hand verrrrrrrrrrrrrry yummy. Definately most have next time anyone decides to stop by.   But all in all the verdict is you typical Chinese Take Out Place.  *puts the menu on the fridge*"}
{"text":"Fried rice super bland. Chicken was slimy. Service was indifferent.  No repeat visit for me."}
{"text":"The worse \"Chinese food\", even the white rice which came with the ogle sweet and sour chicken is really bad.  Please don't eat this food."}
{"text":"This is place makes delicious food!! We got the sweet and sour chicken, veggie fried rice, and fried dumplings. Everything was high quality (white meat, lots of veggies, etc..), fresh and delicious! We were really surprised! Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Came in for take out around 330 today. Food was ready in 5 min. Service was good. Rice is a little plain but i just add some soy sauce. General tso had NO flavor. Not crispy at all assuming thats why it was so fast. Sweet snd sour chicken was to moist. Only reason i would go back is speed. Not worth it flr the price. Had better food at buffet"}
