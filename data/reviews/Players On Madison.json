{"text":"We ate here about two weeks ago and every aspect of the meal was perfect. Service was outstanding. Beemster salad was great. Dressing on the med salad was out of this world.  Bartender who also was our server made a beautiful dirty gin martini. Patio peach pizza will have you rethinking the pizza pie. And my old man was in his glory because they had banana cream pie for dessert. I told everyone I know about it. Now I'm telling everyone I don't know...eat there. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 5-6 times.  Consistently very good and I mean that all around: food, service, etc."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Players! We come here several times a year and during the warmer months, more. We live very close and love to walk up there. Our most recent visit was with another couple for valentines day and I had the duck, my friend had make your own pasta and the husbands both had pizza. We also ordered salads and apps and everything was great! Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good service. However,  the best part of the meal were the appetizers.  The entrees had too much of everything.  Hearty meals not sophisticated meals.  The same flavor overwhelms the meal."}
{"text":"I'm from the area where Players is located and actually used to frequent the pizza joint which preceded it, when I was a child.  I've been there a couple of times as an adult visiting family in the area.  It's a nice place for a slightly fancy dinner or evening out without having to drive too far.  On my most recent visit, we wanted to check out the patio for the first time and have some food that was light and decent and a cut above the usual sandwiches and bar food around Lakewood.  We got there early enough to snag a table on the patio, which was very nice as it was a nice day out and most of the rest of the restaurant is very dark and away from windows, so almost all the diners were eating on the patio.  

The menu is pretty extensive and our server was helpful in describing all the food and the daily specials.  I think they may have been short staffed because it was early in the evening, as there was a bit of a wait for service, but the server was pleasant and enthusiastic when she did come around.  At some point another restaurant employee who I think was the seating hostess was helping patrol the tables probably to take up the slack and was a little overzealous in that she wanted  to take my plate while I was still eating - I didn't let her because the food was good.

The biggest minus to our meal was that someone at the next patio table, fairly close to ours, who also seemed to be a regular diner as he seemed familiar to the staff and was kind of showing off his knowledge of the food to his dining companions, decided to light up a CIGAR on the patio in the middle of his, and our, meals.  I understand that a lot of people are perturbed by the smoking bans but this is a nice restaurant and I don't expect people to be smoking with their food.  Maybe after dinner, but like I said, he and his table were about midway through their meal.  A large amount of cigar smoke proceeded to waft in our direction getting right in my mom's face.  The restaurant needs to make clear that the patio is for smokers, if indeed that is the point of having it, since I didn't see anybody else smoking and like I said I wouldn't have expected that around fine food. 

The portions of some of the food, especially the Make-your-own Pasta, are VERY generous, way more than I could eat at one meal especially since we had appetizers (also very good) first.  I asked for a take-home container and I actually got three meals out of the pasta, which was very fresh and good.   By contrast, when we ordered two desserts to go (as I had another appointment I had to get to), I was a little surprised at how tiny they were.  I'm not a fan of the ginormous slices of pie you get at chain restaurants, but given that my bowl of pasta was huge I was expecting my creme brulee to be bigger than a couple inches across, and maybe be accompanies by a little fruit rather than just sort of thrown in a clear takeout box upside down. 

Overall, I'd go back to Players but I'm definitely going to ask them to clarify their smoking policy before we sit on the patio again."}
{"text":"Great food(with some unique options), large portions, great service, many wine options and a nice atmosphere good for a date or a small group dinner. I would not bring young children here. One of the classiest places in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Always have great service, great drinks (flavorful and strong!), and great food.  Friday night was no exception.  The duck was cooked perfectly - duck can be oily/greasy - this was not greasy and the skin was crispy but thin.  The lobster special was very good as well.  The mashed potatoes with the lobster were bland and rather unspectacular compared to the lobster.  

We keep going back so it's a solid recommendation to our friends."}
{"text":"Good date spot.  Get the mac n cheese.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, would give zero stars if that was an option.
    I ordered the tenderloin which was great while my boyfriend ordered baked penne pasta, the sauce was watered down and tasteless, it reminded us of canned pasta. It was not worth the $24 paid for it. 
   Our waitress was very inattentive and it was mostly the busboy and another waiter serving us. I had told her of the coupon shown above for the mussels while ordering, before the check was even printed, and she exclaimed she had never seen it before and promptly ran off with my phone out of sight without permission. I had no idea where it was and she had taken it for a prolonged amount of time without notice. It was very unprofessional and our waitress was demanding an 18% tip although I had some of the worst service of my life. 
   Infuriated, we paid our bill and did not leave a tip, and as we begun to cross the street, the waitress stormed out of the establishment and chased us harassing us for why we didn't tip her! For the service we had received and the discrimination I had witnessed against us, her \"gratuity\" was worth a penny to me."}
{"text":"We went on a recommendation from a friend - it was outstanding!
Service was a bit on the slow side, but we were there to enjoy a nice night out and weren't in a rush. We ordered the scallops, ravioli and brie app.  Everything was perfect.  Our expectation were high - place isn't cheap....we left completely satisfied and looking forward to returning.  Portions were surprisingly large and everything was very \"special\".  I'd go as far as saying it was up there with one of the top meals I have ever had. Parking is free and right next to building.   Attire was from dressy denim to sport coats."}
{"text":"As an out of town Yelper, I turned to my Yelp friends for dining advice while on business in the Cleveland area.  Thanks for your help, it was pretty good food.  The ala carte salad pushed this into the spendy range, and that's what's keeping me from giving the 5-star salute to Players.  Tonight, the mango-lime scampi was tasty - what nailed it for me was the roasted jalapeno whipped potatoes, black bean sauce and lime-cilantro emulsion cast in for texture.  I love hot - the potatoes got better as the meal progressed, like that really good \"creeper reefer\" everyone always used to talk about.  Ambiance? Yes.  Nice place for a meal - subdued and relatively spacious.  Dig it."}
{"text":"Dined there last night with 3 other people. Ordered the duck, came out cold.
Also, I was there for a birthday (mentioned in the reservation), but they seemed to have forgotten about it.
Very disappointing overall."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our meal at players last night! While we have had positive experiences there in the past, we were shocked at how bad our meals were last night. The braised short ribs were fatty and filled with muscle, my wife's tuna was way over-spiced and she couldn't even finish the meal! This is someone who puts cayenne on everything! She mentioned the experience to the waiter and while he apologized he offered no resolution. 

It seemed as if the crowd dropped off dramatically at a restaurant that used to be constantly filled will energy and people.  I can understand why. I hope they make the appropriate changes to bring it back to what it used to be."}
{"text":"We were excited to try out Players on Madison. We arrived and liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. Didn't love our table right by the kitchen but that was not the worst part of the meal. 

First off they did not have any of the seasonal beers (which were on the menu) that I wanted. Secondly we ordered the lobster nachos as a starter. When they arrived they looked good however my wife and I both had difficulty actually finding nah lobster on the nachos. There was a few very small pieces on the nachos and the actual chips were burnt. Definitely not worth $15. 

Then we ordered our entrees. I ordered a calzone as I understood they were known for their pizza and calzones. I ordered mine with green peppers, meatballs and onion and mozz cheese. It came out and again looked good but tasted far from it. It had absolutely no taste. The meatballs were not seasoned, the green peppers were raw and not cooked first and there was hardly any cheese. Definitely a disappointment being that this was supposed to be their specialty. My wife ordered the grilled chicken MAC n cheese. It was ok, nothing special. 

Out bill came to $68. Normally I don't mind spending a little more for good food at a nice restaurant but $68 for a bad tasting calzone, burnt nachos with hardly any lobster and a mediocre MAC n cheese was quite disappointing. 

Overall I feel that Players on Madison has potential but is lacking an identity as to what type of restaurant they actually are. They had everything on the menu from Italian to entrees to daily specials. Even the waitress couldn't really identify what they were. 


Needless to say we were quite disappointed with our first experience at Players and will be in no hurry to return."}
{"text":"This easily one of the best restaurants in Cleveland - better than Fire and Edwin's and more reasonable too! You cannot go wrong with the food here. Order anything, and it'll be a carefully made, inspired dish. And since I'm a vegetarian I don't have worry about picking from 2 or 3 boring options from a large menu. There's incredibly delicious veg food on the menu (and I hear that the meat is just as delicious). Try the mushroom ragout or the four cheese pizza or the salads. Actually, try anything- it'll be effing delicious! The servers and the ambience are also top class. It's great to have a world class restaurant right here in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went to Players last night for the first time and was quite pleased overall.  Began with last night's special salad, roasted Ohio grown yellow and red beets with goat cheese, pistachios, and a balsamic reduction.   Two of us ordered it and agreed it was fantastic!  The beets were perfectly done, still firm, not mushy as is so often the case. I could be very happy having a slightly larger portion as a main dish--it was that tasty.  We ordered four different entrees, and everyone was very happy with their choice. Two were from the menu...roast pork tenderloin and angel hair pasta..and the others were nightly specials.  My friend ordered the Ohio City Pasta ravioli stuffed with ricotta and asparagus, which she absolutely loved, and I opted for the pan seared scallops over wild mushroom risotto finished with lemon beurre blanc.  They were sweet, tender and perfectly done.  The risotto was tasty and the sauce a perfect compliment. My only complaint was the scallops were crusted with way too much peppercorn.  The crust totally overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the scallops. Once I scraped the crusts off, the scallops were delicious!  My only other, admittedly minor, complaint was my Lemon Drop martini was so tart (sour actually) that it wasn't really enjoyable. Switched to a vodka and tonic. Loved the physical space although our table for four was VERY small, requiring us to frequently rearrange dishes, glasses and baskets to accommodate new items. The patio is charming and had it not been for incoming rain, we would have eaten al fresco...something we'll definitely do when we return. Which we definitely do as we all agreed we really like Players!"}
{"text":"Today was my first experience dining at Player's On Madison.  I've had drinks at the bar previously which was an enjoyable experience as well, but this time, I dined at the bar to take advantage of the fine happy hour specials.  My friend and I, shared the Prosciutto Wrapped Smoked Mozzarella, Chorizo and Monchego Stuffed Banana Peppers, and the Goat Cheese Stuffed Pepadew Peppers.  Let me tell you, the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella was fantastic, an excellent deal for $5 at happy hour, the other apps were tasty as well. We also had 2 soups that were the specials of the day, a Red Gazpacho and a Tomato and Roasted Red Pepper Bisque, which were delish.  We were on quite the run food-wise and decided to split an entree.  We shared the Pan Roasted Chicken Breast, which was good, and why my review is only 4 stars.  The chicken is set up for success being stuffed with bacon and Fontina cheese, served with heavenly yellow pepper whipped potatoes, and beautifully topped with the fried zucchini.  However, what made it not so good was how tough the underside of the chicken was, and how mismatched the sauce was to the rest of the dish.  To me, this would be a perfect dish it hadn't been overcooked on the underside, and served with a more appropriate sauce, but knowing these two things I would still order it again.  I think it was a fluke as to the chicken being overcooked.  The service was good, the servers were very friendly/ knowledgeable.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Jim B. My husband and I ate at Players last night. I also remember Players from the time it opened. The food was so good and innovative. And the place was always packed with diners. It was the first place to do goumet pizza in Cleveland. Alas it is no longer the delicious place I remember. It has been a good 20 years since I last visited, and I seriously doubt I will go again in another 20 years. The restaurant was pretty, but empty. That should have been the first clue it was not the Players I remembered. The menu offered an unremarkable selection of appetizers and entrees. It is no longer the trend setter it had once been. While the design your own pizza and pasta is still on the menu, my husband opted for their Giuseppi pizza which was simply terrible. The crust was dry, brittle and tasteless. The toppings were worse. I realize Thai chili sause is sweet but the pizza tasted as though there was marmalade on top. The chorizo added no spiciness at all. Prior to the pizza we ordered a special appetizer, lobster nachos. Again the nachos lacked any flavor. They had been put in the oven and many of the chips were burnt. Other than what appeared to be locally grown corn and some fresh jalapeno slices nothing had any flavor. The lobster was practially non-existant. I had opted for the beet salad and again - it really lacked flavor. So in the end we paid a lot of money for a meal which was completely disappointing. I must say I cannot understand how this place remains in bisiness given that there are so many restaurants in the county which serve much higher quality food."}
{"text":"Awesome decor. Menu is outstanding could have ordered all if it. My steak was to die for. Can't wait to order Italian. Happy hour drinks were very generous. This is on our regular list for Lakewood."}
{"text":"Great food, very nice atmosphere, wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"players may be a great place to take that special someone for a holiday or your insignificant other for a special day.  great food, classy decor, and great staff.
but it's also a great place friday after work for happy hour with your girlfriends.
the grapetini is like eating grape ape from hanna barbara.
except grape ape talks like a neanderthal.  and the grapetinis, given enough time, will make you do the same."}
{"text":"Not too impressed, but not completely disappointed either.

What Players has going for it are the following things: ambiance, location, service, and carbs.

I really liked the waitress, and I loved how it was a little bit upscale without being too fancy or pretentious. But other than the bread (which was served with a delicious olive oil infused with red pepper flakes), everything else fell flat.

The salads were way too overdressed, and my Caesar, for example, was extremely garlicky to the point of being spicy. For the first time in my life, I didn't finish a Caesar salad.

I had pasta, which, to be fair, I created myself with a \"make your own\" mix and match thing that you can also do for the pizzas. A cool concept, but the ingredients were really not too awesome. Angel hair with tomatoes, basil, fresh mozzarella and prosciutto with garlic and oil SHOULD have been delicious. Instead, it was pretty flavorless, except for the overly salty and smoky prosciutto, and swimming in oil. I was totally turned off. The basil was shredded instead of whole-leaf which really also annoys me in general, and the fresh mozzarella didn't have that tender, delectable texture and flavor like it should. Overall... Fail.

The special of the day, the butternut squash ravioli, should have also been a standout, and the waitress boasted that it was, but both of my dining companions who had it said there was hardly any seasoning and that its accompaniments (caramelized onions, apples, and bacon) just tasted odd with the dish.

Everyone who had pizza said it was awesome. Just from looking at it I could tell that I wouldn't have agreed...but that's neither here nor there. :)

Finally, someone else had the fettuccine arrabiatta and loved it so much that he was making everyone at the table taste it. Um, gross. It tasted like something from the Olive Garden. Maybe he was just lying to us and trying to get rid of it.

In general, I was satisfied with the dining experience, but the food did not measure up. As the pasta itself tasted good, I'd probably just go with a basic sauce next time and not try to put so many subpar ingredients on my dish. But there probably won't be a next time."}
{"text":"While they had several vegetarian options, the vegan options were hard to find. However, once I settled on something, I was not disappointed. Service was also great and I appreciated the excellent anniversary special during the month of April. Reservations are suggested if you want to go on a weekend."}
{"text":"Everything about our experience was so great. We came in on a Friday right at 5 and we were celebrating a special occasion with about 16 people. We planned on just doing the happy hour (which is fabulous) so didn't really make a reservation. They extended the happy hour menu to their patio so they set up a nice corner spot for us with no wait/problem at all. Our waiter was so wonderful and attentive to everyone coming in at different times and keeping track of separate checks and everything. Their happy hour menu is so legit and delicious! We got pretty much every small plate you could get which was about 10ish items and they had drink specials as well. Everything I tried was so good and for $6 the portions were larger as well. Their patio is so cute too. The inside is very nice as well and I definitely will be back for more! I was having such a great time I forgot to snap pics but believe me check it out."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. It was a fun evening as a whole, but one dish was not right. Let me explain. 

We started our evening at the bar- great drink and beer selection. The bartender found out I liked St. Germaine and made a special drink. It was awesome. Then we moved to our table which was ready on time. So far so good. 

Our server was lovely. She spaced everything out and made great recommendations. We started with a bottle of wine and the lobster pizzette. Delicious!  And it had plenty of lobster. 

Then I ordered the sea bass special with jasmine rice and citrus sauce.  The fish was perfect, fresh and tasty. My husband ordered the duck which was explained as a half duck cooked medium rare. Well, it came out as two legs (no breast) which were dry and overcooked. He was quite disappointed. In hindsight he should have sent it back as it wasn't what was explained. 

We passed on dessert although the selections looked yummy. We'll go back since we typically have a great experience here."}
{"text":"An upscale dining spot with lots of options.

A large menu of make-your-own pizzas sits right next to a wonderful selection of seafood and steaks.  Dishes are meticulously prepared and presented, each with unique flavors.

A favorite way for my wife and I to dine here is by sitting at the bar for happy hour.  Their drink specials and small plates / bites at the bar are hard to pass up, and can easily satisfy and entire meal's worth of food options."}
{"text":"Player's was the place all the boys took me in highschool when we wanted to go on \"fancy dates.\" Ok, so it was just one boy, and he worked there so he got a huge discount, but still. 

This place is pricey, but the incredible creativity of the chefs is worth the check. One of my favorite meals there was several years ago, when the Chef listed \"A Study in Mushrooms\" on the menu. What followed was an incredibly gourmet assortment of risotto, ravioli, and other small plates, all featuring perfectly prepared varieties of mushroom.

For the cost-conscious, the make your own pasta and pizza menu option can be pretty inexpensive, though once you see the list of toppings, it's also easy to drop a ton of cash for fresh goat cheese, sundried tomatoes, and other ingredients to spice up your pie.

Another great way to enjoy this restaurant is to go for dessert and a drink. Their bartenders are incredible, their wine list impeccable, and the daily creme brulees and cheesecakes tempting. However, I always order the same dessert any time I am there: Coffee and Doughnuts. Fresh homemade doughnuts, hot and crispy and straight from the deep fryer, are sprinkled with powdered sugar and a drizzle of dark chocolate syrup, then topped with homemade coffee gelato. WOW. Perfection."}
{"text":"i prefer to go to players in patio season.  menu of choice: tasty cocktail, seasonal salad, and a spiffy gourmet pizza... and maybe another cocktail.  linger a bit, take in the night air.  another niceity: courteous, attentive staff"}
{"text":"Excellent entres, and lower priced options (including pizza). 

Their patio is beautiful."}
{"text":"Living in Lakewood I have been told that this a must visit and I was not steered wrong. My boyfriend and I went for his birthday and were surprised to find that they had all evening happy hour on Sunday's. We took advantage of the $5 glasses of wine and $6 appetizers and started off our evening with the Margarita pizzette and steamed mussels.  Even more surprising was the  intimate patio hidden behind the neon Players sign. We enjoyed the enclosed patio and had a hard time deciding what to order because it all sounded absolutely delectable. 

We both settled one items from their specials menu. I ordered the Espresso black pepper strip steak with balsamic glaze and could not have been happier with my decision.  My guy ordered the swordfish which was also top notch.

With their generous happy hour and delicious selection I will defiantly be back. Don't let the name and visage fool you this is a must visit."}
{"text":"Players, why did your Ravioli and Tuna specials set us back $28 bucks each a pop and both dishes weren't even that tasty? I was expecting better from you. Both dishes seemed under seasoned and definitely not the quality we were expecting for the price.

I liked you for your ambiance, your restaurant definitely seems to scream \"date night\" - but I felt as if I was under dressed compared to many of the other diners (I was wearing dark blue jeans and a black top).

Another one of our dining mates created his own pasta - which is cool to have the option, but the serving was small and the noodles lukewarm. Not a fan.

The icing on our bad experience? We had reservations for 7pm, arrived early. We were seated, ordered drinks, salads, and dinner. And then we watched every table around us (all seated after us) be served before us - one table even finishing dinner AND dessert before we were served. How this is possible? I have no clue. It took the waitress QUITE some time to even address the fact that we had been waiting forever and said our food would be out shortly - but offered no other explanation. We're not usually ones to cause a scene or be negative Nancy complainers so we let it slide, thinking maybe we'd be offered a free drink or some dessert? Nope. Just horribly slow dinner service. The waitress seemed genuinely embarrassed but didn't offer much in the way of an apology.

I'd try it out again, but my hopes were really higher for this place."}
{"text":"Very unique Pizza cuisine!  My fav is the white pizza and mussels.  Made to perfection.  A little pricey but the food is great!  Best to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I have been to Players on two occasions: a celebratory dinner and drinks/appetizers after work.  The dinner was some time ago (est September 2007) but everything at that time was phenomenal - service, food, environment.
The after-work visit was at the bar and was pretty good; the drinks were mixed well and the bartender was knowledgeable and friendly.  We ordered a mista salad, which was quite good.  We did make the mistake of consuming some fritters they had.  They were thick and too creamy and sat in my stomach like a brick - not recommended.  
I'll go again, it a great place, but likely stick to lighter fare."}
{"text":"What a great spot for a dinner with friends. My wife and I joined can other couple here and we were pleasantly surprised by this Lakewood institution. The menu ha so many great choices it was hard to decide. The drinks were really good as well. I had the Salmon and it was cooked to perfection. Great service and reasonable prices will make this a staple for us in the future."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar on a quiet Wednesday.  Ordered two starters- portobello pierogies and stuffed banana  peppers, both tasty but served luke warm.  Seeking a great thin crust pizza we tried the Danilo-  good flavors but the crust was underdone, would have been better a bit crispier."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Food is Devine! Everything here is good. Service is great too."}
{"text":"My wife and I first came here for dinner on our anniversary last year and it was great.  While we were sitting at the table, we noticed a wine tasting promotion they had at the table and we were intrigued.  

I am not a big wine connoisseur (far from it)... what caught my eye was the description of the different courses (which included sea bass, duck, and ostrich).  The price tag was $75 per person and that included tax and tip and it was well worth it (to justify the expense, we refrained from eating out for the month before).  There were six courses in all and each came with a glass of wine that was paired with the food.  The first course was an appetizer and the final course was a dessert (with a dessert wine) and the other four were small meals unto themselves.  Each course was amazing and we were so stuffed by the time the dessert arrived.  I recommend going to one of these if you notice they are having one (I haven't seen any lately... maybe they only do it in the winter time?).

This place has excellent service and great food.  It's a little pricier than our average \"night out\" so we mostly reserve it for special occasions."}
{"text":"We had a work dinner at Player's on Tuesday night and the service was atrocious.   Our waitress was virtually non-existent and it took us well over two hours for a simple meal.  The manager was even less help.   To top it off the waitress \"inadvertantly\" ran an extra hundred dollars on our bill after we gave her our card.  Be very careful at this place.  On the plus side our food was still good.    Previous visits had gone well but this place is definitely headed in the wrong direction and we won't be back."}
{"text":"It was a place I'd been wanting to try since moving to Lakewood a year and a half ago. Last night, my waiting ended as I and a friend dined at Players. I happened to have a $10 off coupon from \"The Deck\" for Cleveland Independents restaurants, and I used it at Players. All in all, I think it was a smart choice. The salad I had included Gorgonzola, which I enjoy normally. I asked the waiter whether he recommended the salad featuring that cheese--a more traditional take on fancy salad, or the one with pears and a vinaigrette. He simply asked if I liked Gorgonzola. I responded \"yes,\" and that was that--it was the salad that included that that I ordered. The salad was pleasant enough--nothing to write home about, but good. I ordered a pizza because I'd heard Players had good ones. I probably should not have for the price. I noticed they tack on an additional buck plus some change to each additional item added to the pizza--'nothing usual about that'  you might say. But when considering the size and quality of the dish, it turned out to be, like the salad, nothing to write home about. My friend made a wiser choice, though a more expensive one, in going with the crab cakes. He let me try a little and I discovered the flavor was more \"worth the price\" than my pizza. It was around $24 for his crab cakes. They were delicious, and I was particularly impressed with the asparagus that came on the same plate: it was cooked just right--not overdone and soggy, not underdone and too hard. Just right. I noted that his dish also included risotto under the crab cakes, which looked good. An overpriced adventure, minus the $10 off coupon we used. I do not plan on returning soon. But I give it a simple \"good\" rating."}
{"text":"I went yesterday for a quick bite after a long set of cases.  Had the Penne alla Vodka with a Viogner by the glass.  

Ambiance was nice; urbane with a splash of modern hip-bar.  Service was timely.  Prices slightly higher than I would have expected, but reasonable.

The shrimp within the pasta were flavourful, but a tad overcooked and salty for my tastes, as was the sauce itself.  It's hard to know whether the remainder of their dishes have the same degree of sodium, but it was still tasty."}
{"text":"Players is a local hidden gem that we fell in love with on our first visit! The mushroom penne pasta dish was a great large sized portion that we will be returning to get again! We also had the brown butter ravioli & it was made perfectly as well. 2 wonderful meals topped with a great wine list, great atmosphere and delicious pistachio creme brûlée."}
{"text":"THE UP-SIDE:  Really great food.  Period.

THE DOWN-SIDE: Restrooms are small and always have a wait.

THE SUM-IT-UP: Great place for a date, with great food and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"So I'm back and revising to one star ... No substitutions ... Really this is Cleveland not LA ... The customer pays the money and makes the choice .. I love this restaurant but it will have to be exceptional for me to come back ... How frigging pompous"}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple. I rarely write a negative review, but after 2 recent \"blah\" experiences here, I felt compelled to contribute.

Years ago, I loved this place. Great food; great service. Nowadays, not so much.

Experience 1 - sat on the patio in the summer for a family dinner on a Saturday night.

Pros:
- Great patio atmosphere
- Nicely crowded, so you felt like you were somewhere fun

Cons:
- Slow, bad service
- High prices for the type of foods
- Food quality low (lobster nachos - where was the lobster?)

Experience 2 - sat inside with girlfriends for dinner and drinks on a Friday night.

Pros:
- Nice atmosphere inside for an upscale dine with friends
- The mussels arrived hot and tasty!

Cons:
- Hardly anyone in the restaurant on a Friday at 8pm
- Drink order took 30 minutes to arrive, and they were out of certain ingredients
- Service was awkward, slow and unapologetic
- Pizzas were average; tasted like a frozen pizza
- The music would play randomly then stop for 15 minutes at a time, which felt too quiet

Overall, I can't say I'd recommend this restaurant when there are many others that are better (want pizza & pasta - go to Little Italy!). But the atmosphere is nice; perhaps it is better suited for drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"I struggled with the 4 or 5 rating, but I'll tell you why I moved it up to 5 ... the FOOD!!! Delicious. A business associate who lives in the area asked around at the office for a good place to take two of us for dinner who were flying in from opposite sides of the country, so we ended up here. It was a great recommendation to her. Dog-tired as I was after an early flight out of LA, this restaurant perked me right up and was definitely worth the visit. 

Let's get the bad stuff out of the way: the restroom is a shared male/female single unit ... sorry, but just not one of my favorite things. 

Now the good stuff ... the FOOD!!! We had a brilliant waiter who really knew the menu well, could make recommendations and answer lots of questions. I caution any dessert lovers to keep away from their bread. Actually, the bread is good, but the seasoned butter one slathers on it is fabulous. The three of us ordered a second basket of bread, said how yummy it was, but I know we were all secretly in love most with the butter. Alas, we pigged out at the front end and had no room for dessert. Entree ... I had the penne pasta in vodka sauce and loved it. The other two had equally delicious meals. The special featured salad that night was very enjoyable, and the gazpacho soup was really well prepared. 

It's a cute little restaurant, sort of eclectic deco mixed with something else (I don't know what), but we all decided we liked the clean look and decor of the place. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little bear, always as a treat with my newly divorced father, and younger brother. When I was little, the warm spinach salad was my go-to, and the other two would tuck into pizzas and pastas. The melty, sweet leaves tasted like buttery caramel, and forever changed how I viewed \"salads,\" Although that one has sadly since been replaced thankfully the perfectly crisped, rich yet light croutons have found new a new home on other salads.

See, most food memories can never be lived up to again; they exist only as sensory flashes, like pain, that you can reflect on but never truly achieve again. 

Players is the one restaurant that not only met my expectations but exceeded them. When I've been there in person, the somewhat awkwardly bright dining area was full of attentive, earnest, competent servers and a diligently sweet manager. The warm bread and flexible wine list opened up the meal, to a contemporary American influenced Italian menu that I was genuinely excited for. Not too wordy (the sign of a chef that needs to prove they're \"elegant\" but come across like a pretentious home-cook-foodie), but descriptive enough that I could anticipate and imagine what I was getting. 

Here's what to get...
the Mista salad: while the big, daunting raw rings of onion could use a little work, their roasted strawberries are just sweet enough, and not too gummy. A seriously well-balanced vinaigrette; tangy and satisfying.

The gorgonzola Pizzette (ask for extra grapes!): rich, earthy gorgonzola on expertly roasted thin crust with wonderfully juicy, bursting half-grapes, drizzled with honey. I hope they never take this one off the menu; it is expertly put together every single time I've gotten it, delivery or in the restaurant. 

And wow, congratulations Players, because you've delivered Cleveland's first actually good burger.
After living in New York City and Brooklyn for 5 years, I was desperate to find a solid burger. While Dumont Burger in Brooklyn will forever hold my heart, Players satisfied a year long search that had resigned itself to the (f-ing) B-Spot. Burgers are the one thing I will send back if poorly cooked; medium rare is a sacred thing to me. Players has some gifted grill cooks; excellently seared outside, lightly pink until a gorgeously juicy near fuchsia center absolutely bursting with flavor. Topped with arugula and home-made aioli, served on a fluffy bun with crispy fries and house-made ketchup flavorful enough to be a pasta sauce at the side? 

Dayam."}
{"text":"Hurry in! Players on Madison will be closing its doors forever on Oct 4, 2015. On the upside, word is that something new and exciting will be happening in the same spot, perhaps with many of the same key, um, players.

{"text":"I really wanted to like Players.
Everyone told us it was a Lakewood staple, but we were so disappointed.
We started with the almond-crusted brie and stuffed peppers.
Brie was pretty good, stuffed peppers were sooo spicy they were almost inedible.
Next, I had a pretty good salad with goat cheese.
For an entree, I figured I couldn't go wrong with the salmon...it was disgusting.
It was flavorless and dry, I only ate about 1/3 of it.
There are SO many great places to eat in Lakewood, Players was priced in my opinion.
Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about this place.  I just recently was introduced to this amazing restaurant.  From the outside you wouldnt think much, may not even look twice BUT the minute you walk in you are in for an amazing treat.  We had these shrimp skewers that were in a some kind of chili sauce.........I could have ate all 20 of them!  I ordered the mac and cheese.....this is'nt your typical kraft mac and cheese, this is AMAZINGNESS topped with thinly sliced chicken and yummy bacon. Next time you are in the neighborhood stop in and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Players is very good, but it doesn't wow me.  Still, I've had good meals each time I've been here, and the atmosphere is quite nice.  It's a fine restaurant....what's keeping me from giving it 5 stars?  I'm not sure..."}
{"text":"Fair and not as good as it used to be. I have been a customer for years but the past few times have been fair"}
{"text":"i saw a lot of really great reviews about this place and wanted to check out the venue with my girlfriend.  i made a reservation and arrived a bit late, and i was aware of the time but hopeful that the restaurant would at least accommodate us in some way.  

we walked in and the greeter was less than enthused to see us.  he said that the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes, which i really expected.  however what i did not like, was that there was no offer to sit at the bar, no offer to accommodate us at all.  furthermore they promptly canceled my reservation no sooner than 10 seconds from us walking out the door.  

ultimately i do overstand the time constraint but i felt the attitude and service, or lack thereof, was poor."}
{"text":"Not god awful, but I was very thoroughly unimpressed with Players. In fairness, I only gave them one chance and had a calzone rather than pizza. Still, it did not reveal even a hint of promise and thus I never returned."}
{"text":"Date and pear salad had a tasty vinaigrette and was delicious. Cavatelli with enormous meatballs was not so good. There was not enough sauce and the size of the meatballs was a little off-putting. Service was minimal."}
{"text":"With a name like \"Players\" I was expecting everything BUT a lovely, romantic and fabulous restaurant. 

Like what, you ask? 

Welp, more like a chotchy sports bar filled with extremely scary townies and convicted felons. 

What I actually walked into was a beautiful dinning spot with a huge patio covered with ivy and little, white, twinkling lights. I discovered my secret pick for the most perfect, romantic date night. I've been recommending it to everyone since!  Considering most people venture downtown or to Tremont for fine dinning, I love having this little Lakewood sneaker in my pocket.

Their menu is fantastic. Fancy, but not too pretentious. Fresh salads, seasonal picks and decadent entrees. I love that you can build your own pasta dish just the way you like it. Pizzas are also made to order here and ready for take out too. Players is just such a versatile restaurant. The perfect mesh of laid back, comfortable vibes--but fancy and uniquely upscale enough to impress! 

I could go on, but I won't. I'll end it here with this last thought:

Listen here, gentlemen... and listen good. You want to do something nice for the lady in your life? A romantic night out perhaps, but sick of the same old places? Don't want to spend an arm and a leg on a great, upscale meal and a cocktaill? Take a moment to re-read this review and let it sink in."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about Players, and was scared that it wouldn't live up to all the talk - but it does! 

They are currently doing a 25th Anniversary special menu where you get three courses for $25.  I highly recommend this place for a gathering of any kind (especially dates gentlemen...great spot to take someone special).

Note:  Make sure to order something you'll enjoy the day after.  They are not shy about portions here, and I always go home with a doggy bag!"}
{"text":"If you eat meat....their barbequed pork with a corn and bacon ragout is easily one of the best meals I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"I took my fiancee there for her 30th birthday with a relatively large group of friends. I selected Players because of the reputation. I would have to say we as a group were disappointed. Our server was not on the ball for such a large group. At one point I asked for a beer menu and she never brought it. I did not feel compelled to ask for it again. We had to ask her to clear appetizer plates, and  when our main entrees came. She never cleared the plates in front of my fiancee and we just ate around them. I ordered a burger medium well and a lobster pizza. The burger was overdone and lacking of all juice the fries it was served with were luke warm. The pizza had a firm crunchy crust that seemed to be overdone. It was what I would expect if I went to Applebee's not somewhere that charges 22 dollars for a lobster pizza and 16 bucks for a burger. Honestly, I do not mind spending the money, but I expect more from these places. I would not recommend players to anyone who asked me and I don't see myself returning. There is way too much competition in this segment to have bad service and bad food. I would have complained but I did not want to ruin the evening."}
{"text":"Went here three times, for pizza specifically.
First time, on an empty Tuesday night, the short rib pizza was loaded with meat and toppings - awesome!
Second time, sitting at the bar on Friday, the same short rib pizza was completely different, hardly any meat at all (we questioned if it was even on the pizza).
Third time, got a pizza with prosciutto, artichoke, roasted tomatoes, and feta.  Each slice only had one of the three toppings, with no sign of roasted tomatoes. It was also loaded overwhelmingly with tasteless mozzarella cheese, to the point that the cheese layer was separating from the pizza.  The described toppings were extremely sparse.  Crust was chewy.  It was some of the worst pizza we've had....
Service was very professional, and players is a great place, but definitely not for pizza."}
{"text":"Terrific neighborhood restaurant, with unique menu and professional, helpful service.  We were a party of 3 last night and had been there several times before.   The menu didn't contain items that particularly interested us, but the waiter recited the night's specials, including lobster nachos, which we shared-super!  Each of us had the beet salad, but changed the cheese component.  We all agreed that it was the best beet salad we had ever eaten.
We were so satisfied that we shared a chocolate creme brûlée, instead of ordering entrees."}
{"text":"I don't know much about Players besides the fact that they sent me a coupon (pretty sizable one at that too) for being new to the neighborhood. I glanced at the reviews at yelp once and thought \"nice, I'll get there eventually\" but the coupon's expiration date hasten the process.
The ambience was very inviting for a date night with courtship or brownie points scoring in mind. (as Cara L. mentioned in her reviews). I don't do much of that now with 2 kids and a hectic work schedule. 
For appetizers, I had the squid. Ok, Ok. ok, it's the calamari. Mind you squid is English and the word calamari is the plural of the word squid in italian. Squid is squid not matter what language you call it. I know it in a few languages, then again if I say it out loud, you may think I'm cussing at you. Anyways, off my soap box, the squid is awesome. it's served on to of a bedding of vinegar coleslaw which I though, should have been on the side. Also comes with miracle whip, Sriracha sauce and a sweet and tangy thai-ques sauce. All good. The squid was cooked to perfection.
Next, item i had was the Warm spinach salad. Now, this was probably the best spinach salad (or any salad for that matter) I've ever had. Goat cheese (again, the name escapes me), with walnuts, a vinaigrette dressing and sweet slices of pears. Each bit was a an exciting taste explosion of a perfect balance of sweet, tart, cheese and savory. Very memorable.
I had their one of their special items which was just pasta in red sauce with meatballs. Of course the name escapes me. To me it's just tomato sauce with freshly made pasta served with a little bit of pancetta (I had to google that word) and awesomely made meatballs. My companion said the sauce was a little on the sour side, I agree but that's the chief's personal take on the all italian sauce.
My significant other had the Penne alla vodka, which is creamy and with seafood (check out description on their website). Can't go wrong there. I'm a hot head so when I had the left-overs with crushed red the next morning, I thought it was marvelous.
Since this is one of my longest reviews yet, I'm going to say go when you have the chance. It's a real treat."}
{"text":"Completely expectional, hands down the finest \"upscale\" restaurant in Lakewood.

They've been doing it for years too, and it doesn't change. The service is always fantastic, with enthusiastic staff that are helpful and courteous. A large wine list and drink menu.

The food is incredible! rustic and simple Italian and European dishes that are executed by chefs obviously at the top of their game.

Only regret is the price, we dropped around $40 per person for a split appetizer, 2 drinks and 2 entrees, not too bad for this level but $3-5 cheaper on the entrees would go a very long way."}
{"text":"We went here for our first time last night and can't wait to return!! 
The wine list is perfectly okay (nothing to write home about)
The menu is pretty large and has something for everyone! The food came out quickly and was delicious!!! 
We definitely recommend the brie! It was amazing!! I had chicken and my fiancé had salmon and we both loved our meals!! 
Our waitress was attentive and knowledgable! She was present when we needed her without being overbearing! 
We adored the decor in there! It's like an upscale trendy vibe. 
We will definitely be back as there was a ton we wanted to try!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. Service is always great and their new patio makes it a great spot for alfresco dining in the summer. They have a ton of specials so you can try something new everyday. Pair the Mista salad with a pizza of your own design and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I am single so I do take out pizza in lieu of dining in. Can't comment on their food beyond the pizza which is killer and priced very fairly. Def worth checking out."}
{"text":"I am a very forgiving person when it comes to service, especially for wait staff, but Players needs to step up their game. 

Our waiter was lacking for most of the evening. Between placing our drink orders (one wine and one beer) and receiving the drinks, nearly 20 minutes went by. We were told a rambling list of specials immediately before our order was taken (not a very good move if you actually want people to order them). Then another rather long wait. When asked if we'd like another drink, we begged off for the moment. The waiter took that as we were done drinking, and didn't check in again until the bill. He seemed a bit cold or put-off with us for most of the interactions, but perhaps that was simply his personality. 

As for the food, it didn't seem worth the price. The portion sizes seem large, but the quality of the meal didn't compare with the $22+ per plate."}
{"text":"after 15 years since my last visit, players, on the inside, has changed. gone are the tables that were so tightly packed together, that all you got was a face full of butt from the servers.......thankfully!
sat for almost 10 minutes before server acknowledged us, was getting ready to leave, but he finally appeared. 
enjoyed a couple of rounds of cocktails, the drinks were good.
tried the lobster nachos appetizer, on special, for a starter........the BIG flavors of jalapeno, corn & bean salsa, tortilla chips and cheese were all TOO overwhelming for the delicate flavor of lobster, so you couldn't taste the lobster. i would pass from ever ordering this again. 
next up was the beet salad, also on special. wonderful golden and red beets, sliced and dusted with some kind of nut and micro-green....unfortunately all the goat cheese was buried, in a centered blob, on the bottom, which i didn't find until the end. had it been on top, i would have enjoyed this salad much better as i would have been able to taste the acidic cheese against the earthy beets....entree was up next.......it was an ancho sauced pork tenderloin with a corn & bean salsa with grilled aparagus and frites.......the pork was perfectly cooked, tender and buttery in texture that melted in your mouth. the ancho sauce tasted more like a jazzed up ketchup.....the frites were just a ball of shoestring cut potato balanced on top. hard to eat because they were SO thin and crunchy, they just shattered as i tried to pick them up to eat......worst on the plate was the asparagus...i love asparagus, but this was horrible!! they apparently had so much oil on them, that when they were grilled, the heat burnt the oil, producing a black mess on my plate that was SO freakin' bitter and hard on the tongue, i just pushed them aside..........we both passed on dessert..............
decor has an almost, we watched a lot of do-it-yourself tv style to it, but much better than what it used to be.
service is average at best and a bit unpolished. server station seems to be the holding tank for the staff, where they sit on chairs and polish off soft drinks. they should have built a full wall to block view, and noise, from dining area.

overall, ok, but just ok. it wouldn't be on my radar as an  \"i can't wait to come back to\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Players is an interesting place. Not much to look at from the outside, the restaurant is very nice, both in the dining room and on the outside patio. We ate on the patio and, generally, had a good meal. The waitstaff is well-trained and friendly. I started with a special of the day, an appetizer of well-made tortilla chips, topped with lobster and various sauteed vegetables, topped with creme fraishe. Very good. Others at the table also enjoyed their starters. For the main course, I had the scallops special, which consisted of 4 large scallops on top of a fairly plain risotto and some vegetables around it all. It was a nice presentation and, again, generally, the food was tasty. However, the scallops all were gritty, with a bite of sand in each taste. I probably should have complained, but I generally just eat what I am given, assuming that it isn't terrible. This wasn't terrible, but, you would expect a place like this to make sure their scallops aren't gritty. Not too much to ask. At any rate, I would still give Players a 3-star rating, which could have been higher except for this one important, issue."}
{"text":"Great food! The service was pretty bad, would not suggested taking a date here... Don't risk it! This place made me look bad one or twice. Sad really, the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for 15 years, and on a recent trip home, everything seemed off. The restaurant was louder, there was no more Mediterranean salad on the menu, and the pizza crust seemed a little flat.  My warm baby spinach salad would have been a lot better had it not been drowning in dressing.  The crab cakes were a huge, soggy mess.  The penne a la vodka remained near perfection though, as did the coffee and donuts dessert.  Maybe it was just an off night during the busy holiday season."}
{"text":"It's really unfortunate that the lady from MI had such an unpleasant experience. It's so out of character of what I know Players to be that I wonder if there isn't a bit more to the story. Perhaps not. I would suggest that if any diner is being ignored by a server a well-placed comment to the right person would take care of that in a nanosecond. Maybe faster. 

Regardless, my wife and I have been dining at Players since it was 1/2 the size it is now and mostly a glorified pizza place. That was, what, 30 years ago? More? 

Look, I don't claim to be a food critic (although I did for a time write a food column for a well-known mag), but I would wager that following my recommendations won't steer you terribly wrong. That being said, if I were asked to list my Top 10 All-Time Cleveland Restaurants, Players would be on it. Possibly even in the Top 5. And the reasons are many, not the least of which is they have for over three decades been putting out creative and amazingly tasty dishes, several of which have (and I'm not joking in the least) reached iconic status with Players regulars. 

They've had just GREAT chefs including Mark Shary (who, I believe founded it) to Michael Symon (yes, THAT Michael Symon), to John Sweeney to their current house genius, Tony Romano.  And their servers are legendary, too.  OK, maybe not the one Ms. Michigan had, but most of them. 

I KNOW Yelp is going to be tempted to \"filter\" this in the belief it's  from someone with ties to the restaurant. I AM RESPECTFULLY ASKING THEY NOT DO THAT. I am simply a longtime fan who's had maybe everything on the menu (5x!) and know that NO CLEVELAND restaurant has been able to match its consistency and high standards for so long. It truly is a remarkable story and I'm happy to say I enjoy their food as much today as I did 30 years ago. 

Bottom line: Don't let one bad review sway you away from trying one of the truly great restaurants in Cleveland history. And that is NOT hyperbole in the slightest."}
{"text":"Great food for appetizers, dinner, and desert.  It is a little pricey, but not overly so.  It is fine if you know what you're getting into.

One of the most interesting things on the menu is \"A Study In _____\" where the chef gets to play around with whatever ingredient is on hand during that season or month.

Also, if you're getting desert, try the \"Coffee and Doughnuts\".  It is not the flashiest item on the menu, but it is delicious and well worth it."}
{"text":"I've only been to this corner bar and restaurant on a very snowy night for happy hour but it was amazing. They have drinks and appetizers for $5. Delicious food and my fave pinot grigio was flowing! The bartender was delightful and I didn't want to leave! But alas, happy hour was over and the snow was piling up. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Second visit. Second 5 star review. Why was this place empty? I don't understand. The name may be a little curious. The website may look a little dated, but try the food people!! Try it! 

I loved everything about my second experience here. It was as perfect as my first visit. My friend loved it too; he raved about the duck entrée and his salad. His entree came with both a braised leg and a seared breast which were each prepared differently but both good. 

I absolutely loved my pork tenderloin. It was cooked perfectly and was very lean. The sauces on it were so unique and just brilliant! The sweet potato \"cookie\" under it was so unique and just wonderful to eat. The portion sizes are large. The flavours are large. 

The staff from the host to the waitress are just amazing. They are so happy and so knowledgeable and passionate about the food/restaurant. Our waitress did a great job and really added to the experience. When we said our food was so good she let us know that the exec chef was out and that it was \"only\" the sous chef cooking! He may be young and \"only\" a sous chef but he did a fantastic job! The exec chef rightly has no concern leaving the restaurant in his hands. 

There is currently a $5 mussel coupon on Yelp when you check-in. The mussels were great. Broth makes mussels and the broth here was amazing - just the right amount of zing to it and there was Italian sausage slices in it! Unbeknownst to us there was also an unadvertised special where you get a $20 gift card for next time if you buy a $40+ bottle of wine. Great no brainer deal there!! I also snagged a 1,000 point Open Table reservation so be on the lookout for that as well! 

The pictures of the patio look amazing - I will be back to try that."}
{"text":"There comes a time when the prices you charge should include not only the quality of food but the quality of the service. 

The food was good but the service was bad. 

We just wanted pizza so we all ordered pizzas. Well they took a long time to arrive. One was cold and one was missing toppings. The two that weren't cold tasted good, and the manager took two of the pizzas off the bill because I complained. I hate to complain but with those prices I can't be expected to pay full price for sub par food. 

They also charged me for a beer that I didn't order, but after I complained about that they took it off too.

The place wasn't very busy except for one big party, so I guess they had all their attention focused the party. At times it felt like they forgot we were even there, or that we were just an inconvenience.  I know it was probably just an off night so I'll probably give them another chance, but until I have a better experience they get 2 stars."}
{"text":"We went during Restaurant week for a date night! I must say I was extremely impressed!!! The food was wonderful, the server was on top of her game and the atmosphere was soft and romantic! 

Their Almond Crusted Brie is one for the books. I've never had a flavor combination quite like that and it was just wonderful!

The server had suggested a bottle of wine which, if purchased, came with a gift card for the restaurant to use on another visit. GREAT suggestive selling and an amazing way to get people to come back for another round of a tastefully delicious experience!

Going back this evening!"}
{"text":"I had a gift certificate for Players and in light of the closing news, I knew I had to go ASAP.  I have been there for their fabulous happy hour before, but this time we went for dinner.  The place was absolutely packed.  The server said it has been like that ever since the closing announcement was made.  We were told we got the last table and they were not seating anymore customers.  They kept seating folks anyway even though they appeared not to be enough staff.  Anyway, it did take a very looong time to get food or drinks, but the server was working hard.  We split an arugula and strawberry salad.  Hubby opted for pasta and I splurged on lamb chops.  Very wonderful dishes.  Am sad to see Players go, but looking forward to the new Sarita, opening in November.
From their webpage:

Everyone's Favorite Little Restaurant...The End of an Era
With bitter sweet feelings and whole lot of emotion Matty and I have announced our retirement from the restaurant business and the closing of PLAYERS on Madison as of October 4th, 2015.
The past decades of service have been a privilege for us as we have taken on the goal of providing quality food, wine and genuine hospitality, very seriously. What enters your body is a sacred responsibility for those who call themselves restaurateurs, and a restaurant is more than merely a business - it is the equivalent of opening up your home. Countless stories and memories of some of life's great moments have occurred here; first dates, celebrations of special occasions, and the joy of sharing a memorable meal with friends and loved ones. The outpouring of memories and wishes for a happy retirement ring out as we retire the name PLAYERS.
We are encouraged by the continuation of the fine tradition that is at the corner of Madison at Belle with Chef Anthony Romano and his dedicated staff in their new endeavor Sarita - a restaurant, which will debut sometime in early November, 2015.
The memory of your support and love for the experience that was PLAYERS will sustain us for the rest of our lives.
With sincere gratitude,
Matty and Gary Lucarelli
Proprietors
PLAYERS on Madison"}
{"text":"Good food and service. What more could you ask for?  Build your own pizza is always a winner. The salads have never been wrong or better at any other restaurant. Love all their food, but really a treat for their daily specials! And their drink menu is delicious."}
