{"text":"Amazing wine and food! The patatas bravas, albóndigas, charcuterie board, croquetas and pintxos were all so delicious and authentic. Sangria was yummy and service was fast and attentive. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"We had amazing food and cocktails.   There is nothing in Charlotte with this unique Spanish inspired menu.   The space has been transformed.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I want to like Bulla, I really do. Maybe it's growing pains, I don't know, but dinner there tonight was disappointing.
Service: our waitress was nice, but also tough to find or flag down, I'd see her walking around chatting it up with other staff, but we saw our water/busboy more than her.
Food: 
1) patatas--hot and tasty, but left under a lamp, so served to us with congealed solid sauces on top, and just tasting of nothing but fried oil.
2)tuna tartar---sesame oil and mush? No bite or texture whatsoever.
3) tortilla--tasted basically like a potato gratin, no egg really, garlic aioli was good
4) croquetas--again, mush and fried oil, didn't get any ham taste period, fig jam was a good complement
5) huevos bulla--SALT AND TRUFFLE, the chips were soggy before our waitress even mixed them up, but they were salted; the ham was salted, it was just so much salt and then mashed with truffle oil.

Our drinks were decent, I had their mule, my wife their bougie Palmer, and then we shared a bottle of Albariño.


All in all, nothing to write home about, I think we will come back and try the larger plates, but the tapas and service left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Great place and great food. This place is definitely a must try in charlotte! It has great tapas and the paella is amazing!! Sangria is also a must try!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte and they've been open only for 2 weeks.  Seriously, after trying this place my wife and I want to go visit Spain.  We came for lunch last Monday and came right back tonight, less than a week.  Try the grill octopus salad.  The Gambas shrimp was perfectly seasoned.  The service was also amazing.   Everything was perfect.  I love this place!!!! Go try it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Bulla but it was just ok. I had seen that it was opening so my husband and I stopped in on a Thursday night. We sat at a table in the bar area and were served quickly. I have to start by saying that it was pretty stuffy and humid in the restaurant. It's been hot so maybe they're working on getting the temperature right but it was a little uncomfortable.

We shared a pitcher of the red sangria. It was good, but not my favorite. It was a little too sweet and had a strange sugar aftertaste. For food we had the patatas bravas, gambas al ajillo, tortilla espanola, croquetas de jamon, the montaditos, and the paleta iberica. The potatoes were good, but nothing too special. They had a nice sauce and weren't too spicy. The gambas were disappointing. They didn't have much flavor except for some chili flakes and it felt like something I could make at home. The croquetas were also plain, and didn't have much ham. We did really enjoy the tortilla espanola, it was flavorful and was a generous portion. The paleta iberica was delicious, it melts in your mouth. However I'm not sure it's worth $15 for the small portion. The highlight of the meal was the montaditos, a short rib on bread dish. The meat was tender and flavorful and the tomato marmalade was delicious on top. 

We didn't have a bad meal here, I was just underwhelmed by most of the dishes and drinks. I will say the service was fantastic from the host to our waitress. They made an effort to be over the top friendly, know our names, and be there when we needed but not hover too much."}
{"text":"Everything we had here was amazing! We tried the tortilla Espanola, Bulla Burger and the cannelloni. The sangria Blanca was delish and our waitress was awesome. She explained all of the dishes on the menu and was very friendly. We will return soon!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome time at Bulla! The cocktails were delicious-- the Spanish margarita was amazing as was the lemon gin cocktail. All of our food was great, but the tuna tartare was definitely the stand out dish! The service was great-- Sebastian was excellent! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in at their around 3-week mark. Waitstaff was super nice and attentive. Receiving glasses of wine was very slow. I think this had more to do with wherever? it was coming from than the waiter because he kept looking to see if the glasses were ready. Anyway, waitstaff seems a little green - like this may be their first job waiting tables for real. But they all tried and had great senses of humor? and quick smiles. Decor was cool and hip - it is a fun place. Live music in the bar would give a better edge.

The food was just ok. I would do lunch here, but I wouldn't commit to a dinner - Charlotte has developed into quite? the foodie city, so they're going to have to step up their game. Charlotte is also transient, so people have been around and know Spanish tapas and how good it can be.

Things we had:

1 cheese and 1 meat:  the cheese needs better presentation - it was as if I slapped some cheese on a plate for my kids. The crackers were nice, but not nearly enough of the jam to finish the plate. The meat we selected was really good - still boring presentation. I'm sure the preset platter was decked out better, but they shouldn't sacrifice? presentation even? if the order is smaller.

seafood paella: I thought? it was too salty, my husband?  didn't. the presentation was beautiful? - the pan was missing that amazing crust around the edges that Spanish families love so much - my friends from Spain literally argue over who gets it and told me it's like the wishbone. At Bulla, nobody gets? it bc it's not there. They did an amazing job not overcooking? the shrimp and the shrimp didn't have that odd preservative aftertaste? that cheap shrimp has, so that was a huge plus - the squid fell flat though. A little tasteless and rubbery.

ALBÓNDIGAS - the meatballs - they were cold and a little dry. But the flavor was really good. the sauce was really good. I told my husband it seemed like they were cooked earlier, chilled, and they had relied on the sauce to heat them back up. But it didn't work. I do this for my kids at home all the time, so I know the drill?. 

Ceviche -  I  can't complain. it was great. I'm not a big fan of shrimp ceviches and prefer other white fish, but it was really good with flavor.

Overall it was pretty good- but not at the level it can be. I do think the managers need to take field trips to some of the other Spanish tapas places to see what the people in Charlotte love. And maybe the amazing Curate in Asheville. I know I shouldn't compare Bulla to that place and my multiple friends from Spain when they cook at home - but Spanish food is pretty simple and to have it fall flat isn't necessary at all.

I would go back for drinks at the bar and a couple of tapas - but not a full dinner.

That said, they're just catching their stride and are pretty new on the Charlotte scene, so maybe I'd give them another shot."}
{"text":"While visiting friends, they took me to dinner at Bulla. First, I love the set up of the place. It's large and airy with big tables, and lots of space to enjoy good friends and good food and drinks. We were seated at a cozy booth in the bar. The bar is decorated beautifully, and is very modern. We started with drinks. I had the Sangria Blanca which made me feel that I was back in Spain. It wasn't too sweet, but fruity and delicious. For tapas, we shared the gambas, brisket, pork skewers, ham croquettes, manchego, and coppa. Everything was very good. Our server was very sweet, but it seems they still have some kinks in their service. The server seemed to have too many tables, and things took a little longer than necessary. I know the place is new, and will perfect things as they go. I look forward to returning on my next visit to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first trip to Bulla.  Beautiful open  interior - quite a transformation from Chuys!  The service was friendly and prompt.  The food comes out as it is ready, so we felt everything was well seasoned and the temperature was just right.  I, personally, did not venture into some of their specialties, but ordered Shishito Peppers, Roasted Oysters, and the Manchego Cheese.  The individual cheese selection was a nice portion size and came with some delicious glazed pecans, mini breadsticks, and toasted baguettes with fig jelly.
Others in my party tried the salmon and the roasted octopus salad, and were pleased!

Bulla is a nice addition to South Park, and offers something unique to the area.  I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"I liked this place!  The ambiance is nice and I like the way the whole place is open. We tried several of the small plates and they truly were SMALL plates.  I would advise sharing with two people as opposed to 4 because it was hard for  the four of us ladies to get full without having to spend hundreds of dollars.  

The ceviche was the crowd favorite.  It was seasoned to perfection and so flavorful. Delicious 
The croquettes were also amazing and the veal and pork meatballs were SO good.  
We tried the brisket which was our 2nd favorite.  

We then went ahead and ordered the burger because it came with the potatoes and it was one of the best burgers I've had.  The meat was so juicy and the arugala added a nice touch. It was just so good.  
Honestly there was not one thing we didn't enjoy.

Knocked off one star for service.  Had to constantly ask for water, took forever for our wine to come to the table, waiter wasnt super present when we needed him, they were out of one of the wines we wanted which was disappointing...but overall, good experience. 

I will be back and I recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a true Spanish Tapas restaurant. I loved the openness throughout. The ambiance is very inviting yet still private to your party at the same time. 
The servers are very knowledgeable and can assist you with recommendations and questions which made ordering easy. 
While you may get excited with you see six different types of queso, it's truly just the Spanish word for cheese. Not the dip that we all know and love lol. 
The steak was my favorite dish. The sheshito peppers on top are not hot at all. They are actually somewhat sweet. 
If you are a seafood lover you will has SEVERAL options here."}
