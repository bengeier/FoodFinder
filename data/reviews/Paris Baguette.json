{"text":"Employees were very welcoming 30mins before closing, pastries were just like we had in New York"}
{"text":"Paris Baguette has always been one of my favorite Cafe n Bakery shop ever since their inception in the SF Bay Area. I m so glad they r finally open their business in LV. And of all the location, they chose to set up shop inside the Venetian! Major crudos! Because of the popular location, their prices r a bit higher than most Paris Baguette outlets I've been to. But if U were to buy a cup of coffee n a piece of their awesome pastry n get a corner view table upstairs. It will be worth every penny. The ambience looking out the forum shop of the Venetian is much cheaper than buying a roundtrip ticket to Venice!"}
{"text":"Typically expensive Vegas prices, but a cool place to have a European style coffee experience."}
{"text":"Probably a better experience to visit earlier in the day when everything including the ambience may be better. The location from top to bottom needed some TLC as far as cleaned tables, floors and seating areas (such a shame to travel to a unique prime location and it's a little unkempt looks good afar and walk in to see it's reality).  There were less or unavailable options both times we visited, namely the royal pudding 2 days in a row after 5 pm.  Staff is okay, not very engaged and always behind the counter not paying attention.  The blueberry scoop cake was $7.00 but really was more cream than any cake at all.  The $2.50 green tea and raspberry pastry was consistent and tasted great and creme brulee donut was tasty."}
{"text":"Stopped by last week, they no longer have poke bowls. They now sell sandwiches in that section. I like the upstairs seating with a view of St. Mark's square."}
{"text":"Excelente!!!!Es un lugar tranquilo y acogedor,los pastry y los sándwich lo mejor de las Vegas,y su personal muy atento y amable,simplemente lo mejor de las Vegas."}
{"text":"An excellent selection, but where are the baguettes? On my first visit I had the fresh squeezed grapefuit juice and a croissant. 

The croissant was the most buttery and flaky croissant I have ever had. You hear phrases like \"mouth watering.\" Each bite of this croissant does such a phrase justice.

The grapefuit juice comes in a glass bottle with a cork in it. A classy touch and a great keepsake.

It is one of my favorites, in one of my favorite settings. The staff seems like they are eager to please you the moment you walk in the entry. 

Update: theere are the baguettes. Baked fresh and going fast"}
{"text":"Was on vacation decide to stop by. Delicious quiche!! Had to wait about 15 minutes to warm up. A brunch for 2 came out to about $40. A little on the pricy side but overall great food and coffee"}
{"text":"This place was hard to find. When I arrive most of the breads I wanted are already sold. I would definitely come again next time. Overall, I like the upstairs seating with a view and recommend the pastrami panini along with their house iced coffee."}
{"text":"Literally saw an employee pull a hair off a pastry!
This was after we stood there for approximately 10 minutes trying to figure out the menu/ordering process with no assistance from the staff which would been fine if there was a high volume of customers but we were the only customers in the store."}
{"text":"Cute bakery, but nothing more than that.

I was extremely excited to try Paris Baguette. I unfortunately left disappointed. The staff was really nice and the design of the bakery is really cute, but when it came down to the food, they need to learn a thing or two.

Their bakery items are displayed in glass shelves and are self-serve. These items were all dry and hard! It may have to do with them leaving the baked goods in the shelves, but baked goods shouldn't dry out so quickly. The sweet desserts in the fridge all looked super good, but I decided to pass on trying them because they are all too expensive.

They have a variety of coffee, but their machines were not working so I'll have to go back to try their coffee.

Great location in the Chinatown Plaza with plenty of parking!"}
{"text":"When I arrive I asked for a sandwich form the web site and was told they do not make it any longer. And was directed to something else already made. This sandwich was ok but not what I wanted. Little pricey."}
{"text":"Love this place. There are many selections in French pastries and other goodies. Grab a tray as soon as you walk in and pick out your own pastries. The shop is located on the corner side of the open air restaurant area at the Venetian. There are seating on the second floor, a small row area in the cafe and more seating outside. 
Plus check out their deals during happy hour."}
{"text":"This little fast casual eatery was at the perfect intersection of quality and price. I could get a delicious and filling meal for under $10 for breakfast and under $15 for lunch, an almost unheard-of phenomenon. It's conveniently located just outside of the Convention Center on the Canal Shops level. Additional seating is up the stairs overlooking St. Mark's Square.

I was very happy with everything I ordered here - the almond pastry, the ham and cheese croissant, the pastrami and havarti baguette, the turkey mozzarella sandwich, the avocado and pesto pasta salads, the guava pastry. Why eat horrible expensive convention-center food when this little cafe is only steps away?

Would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area and don't feel like spending a lot of money."}
{"text":"Every time I eat at Paris Baguette I fall more and more in love with what they have to offer.  Their cheesecake is my favorite of any that I've ever eaten and every sandwich I've tried has not disappointed.  Thanks Paris Baguette, I'm glad you've joined us at the Venetian/Palazzo!!"}
{"text":"Everything here was amazing! I had the maple BLT to start and it was fantastic, and had a tiny kick of spicy. I bought almost one of every pastry and brought them home to share with my family, and none of the treats disappointed. The only down side is there are only about 3 or tables inside to eat, but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Snacks Snacks and more Snacks...since I stay at the Venetian I always stop in for my afternoon snack if I want something different then Bouchon Bakery...it's a serve yourself type of place so it's fast and the pastry's are pretty good"}
{"text":"After my first visit at Paris B, I was excited to return for those Croissant donuts. They were busy for the holiday on Monday..... shelves rather empty...fifteen minutes wait on line to the register. I asked and waited for my precious reward, and then I saw the unthinkable.The guy at the register boxed my little beauties without wearing any gloves! Do you know what lurks and lives on our paper currency? No Thank You. Even good stuff can make you ill if someone is mindless. I will never return."}
{"text":"Great place to come for pastries and cakes. A little pricey but this is my go-to place when I want pastries/cakes."}
{"text":"I was here for an educational conference and I found this place on the second day. Great options include sandwiches, salads, poke, pastries and coffee. Did not try the poke, but everything else was great!"}
{"text":"We ordered poke bowl. It is delicious. It is healthy choice for a quick lunch. It is conveniently located next to the market square."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Had it for breakfast and lunch. Unbelievably good. My new favorite in Vegas."}
{"text":"On the pricy side. Great location though. Ordered the organic mango drink, I do not recommend it. It's not fresh juice, came out of a plastic bottle."}
{"text":"I loved this little pastry shop and everything we got here was great. I had the chocolate croissant and it was awesome. I am still having dreams about it and wish I could have one sent to me. The staff was super nice and seemed to love their jobs. We also had éclairs and regular croissants and both were amazingly delicious. The croissants were all flaky and soft and the éclair was just knock your socks off good. we also got an apple strudel type croissant and that was also a thing I can't stop dreaming about. Next time I am in Vegas I will visit this place everyday for a snack."}
{"text":"I wish I can say I was impressed but I really wasn't. I walked inside the small, modern bakery and you're faced with endless amount of pastries sitting inside glass casings. 

I walked around but nothing really jumped out and me screaming \"must try\"!

I found the pastries to be on the steep side. However since I was already there I got one mini croissant and one mini choco croissant. The choco croissant was 3x the cost of the regular one. Flavor and consistency was nothing impressive.

Like other Yelpers, the service was definitely lacking here. No one one as friendly whatsoever. 

I may return once they've figured out their footing. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done."}
{"text":"This was quite an experience! First there was a Venetian show in front. I was eating  the most amazing poka bowl watching the show and finish everything with a beautiful muffin! Service is excellent!! I never had poka bowl before and lady explained everything and provided advice. 

Overall make sure to check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here two times, once for breakfast and once for lunch. The overall food quality is good, I think some stuff is made the day before. But the real reason to eat here is the variety, you are pretty much guaranteed to find something you will like. we tried a big sample of pastries and ready made sandwiches. Next time we are going to try some hot sandwiches for lunch. The coffee was pretty good."}
{"text":"I should really give this place 2 stars instead because of their improper advertising. 

Most of the items on this/their yelp page is no longer available. IT's better for you to straight up ignore the pictures of the said products they offer, all are no longer being offered (apple tart, poke bowls, everything else pictured).

Baguette sandwiches were much better than we had anticipated. I got the one with pastrami and it was very good. It was a large sandwich and I realized afterwards it would've been better for my sister and I to share, as we also purchased desserts. She got a sandwich with pesto and other stuff and she quite liked hers as well. The fruit tart was very good and stacked high. The royal pudding, I could've done without but it came in such a cute glass jar. 

However, we came a few hours before closing and found out they don't even bother to make more of items they were out of by that time. We thought they would've given how much time was left that the store would've been opened but it seems like they make what they make every day, and if they are out, you are out of luck.

We ate upstairs and it was so nice to look out the windows to the happenings downstairs. The window was right up against the windows and we were the only ones there."}
{"text":"PG has great bakery items, as one would expect, but the nice surprise is the great non-alcoholic coffee and other drinks, most thankfully cold, in an environment overflowing with beer and cocktails.

I enjoyed the Iced Coffee.  The Green Tea Latte was good, as well.

The Berry Rich Latte and the Berry Matcha Latte look really good; looking forward to trying them. There are hot and iced espresso drinks, as well as other fruit-based drinks, over ice, and blended.

Service is very good!"}
{"text":"The workers were friendly and always willing to help. Bryan, the cashier, specifically offered great help as he described and explained there new choices of beverages. He also helped me choose some of the pastries, giving me examples of his personal favorites. The choices of food were of a great variety and offered many different avenues of tastes and food styles. The food itself did not disappoint! It tastes wonderful and delectable. The asian influence in the pastries worked better than I expected. Paris baguette offers a unique and tasty pastry experience!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 7:30AM and bummed to find that it did not open until 8:00AM so I sat at one of the adorable benches right outside and just took in the beautiful scenery. This hotel is SO GORGEOUS! 

I was the first customer and was greeted by the friendliest barista who made great coffee recommendations and patiently answered my questions. I ordered the Caramel Latte with Soy Milk and this is the best latte I have EVER had! Perfectly heated and frothy, not too sweet and perked me right up for my work day. They even let me try a sample of their house iced coffee since I was worried it might be too sweet for me. 

I have been alternating between their Latte and their House Iced Coffee and both are delicious. The iced coffee is pre-made and has a lot of flavor to it. I recommend diluting it with some black iced coffee because it is pretty sweet or just letting the ice melt a little.

Their baguette and panini sandwiches looked delicious so I will definitely stop by for lunch one day this week while working out of the hotel. Might also have to bring the husband by for a fruit tart or mini alfajor (our fave!!) when he gets out of his conference. I was sad that they didn't have any cronuts this week like another Yelper had mentioned.

So happy I found a reasonably priced coffee/breakfast/lunch spot :)

Tip
* Soy milk is 65 cents extra
* Dilute the iced coffee with black iced coffee if you don't want it too sweet"}
{"text":"Being from LA, this was a slight disappointment. They don't carry all the same items that the regular would. The quality is still good but you can definitely see that it is catered towards the strip and tourists. But the pastries are absolutely phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Paris Baguette has locations all over the world. I'm happy that another bakery has opened in Las Vegas.

While the food is pretty similar to other locations, everything in the case is cold or not as fresh as I am used to elsewhere. The pastries are decent for a quick to go snack. The cakes are amazing and definitely worth indulging sometimes. Drinks are decent as well although need some tweaking. 

The staff is not very friendly and doesn't seem to know how everything runs just yet. Maybe as they get situated things will get more streamlined."}
{"text":"Over priced , a 1.85 $ item sells like 4.75 $ in here. I am from la I know the price! 
The cake was never good, doesn't have a taste"}
{"text":"Patisserie with a twist! They have poke bowls- which are awesome, by the way! A pleasant surprise cuz that's something you wouldn't expect from a place called Paris Baguette. It's very Parisian with all their pastries and coffee but then they have a spread of poke bar on the side.. very good, I must say! And it's right at st marks square so you get that Venetian view at a Parisian patisserie eating a Japanese poke bowl. Lol"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this Starbucks-alternative. Yes they have free internet if you make a purchase. Yes they offer complimentary fresh-fruit flavored water. Yes they have an extremely wide variety of French & Chinese style pastries, sausage en croute, veggie curry en croute, fresh fruit topped light cheesecake. 

Everything is labeled with the calories and all of the ingredients. Overall it's much less sweet than traditional American style pastries. There are some pre-made salads options. Their specialty appears to be elaborate fruit topped cakes for a party. 

I've found service to be excellent, although sometimes they get too busy to greet everyone. Not a problem as they're so helpful when I get to the counter. Also there's always plenty of comfy seating, and quiet French or American music playing."}
{"text":"Love the location! We sat up top and ate our food. The garlic croissant was delicious but want a huge fan of the slightly soggy, curry croquet. Great selection to from but I didn't want to overfill. 

My husband liked his sandwich and the girl at counter was very friendly. 

The poke is what I really wanted but that side wasn't quite open yet... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to rest your feet, grab some fresh baked treats, and sip some coffee or iced tea. Go upstairs for a great view of the plaza below. We visited during happy hour (11 am to 4 pm) and received half off the house iced coffee and peach iced tea."}
{"text":"Glad they put one off the strip. Easier to get to in Chinatown.  Still not a lot of selection.  Really hope that 85 degrees open one up.  Prices is a little bit more."}
{"text":"DON'T SELL EXPIRED CAKES PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!! I'm experiencing food poisoning. I'm sure it was the chocolate cake I had in store because that's the only thing I ate but my friend didn't. NEVER go back and will tell my friends not to."}
{"text":"Was super excited to find that there would be a Paris Baguette  in LV! Now I don't have to look forward to the next Cali road trips (god knows when I'll have the time and money for that with school, work and bills! ) for some pastries and sweet goodness!

For pastries/bread, I definitely recommend the Raspberry hibiscus bombolone, blueberry  cream cheese pastry and the Hash brown one which also has ham in it! And Feulletes  Au Chocolat. Pronounced \"Fay-day\" I believe.  I've yet to try more~

They freshly squeeze their orange juices and grapefruit juices and they come on this tall slim glass bottle with a classic corkscrew that you get to keep! Lovely souvenir along with my 4 royal pudding bottles, which btw ; Their pudding is sooo  yummy and worth trying! Also comes in cute tiny bottles. Good packaging always sells!

For the cakes, I have not yet been disappointed. I've tried the green tea chiffon , blueberry chiffon , tiramisu  creampuff and chocolate cake. And let  me tell you, it was a piece of heaven in every bite. Worth. Their berry parfait is very refreshing and the berries are nice and  fragrant, fresh and sweet. 
I cannot wait to try the  berry tart and lavender macaron next ^ _ ^"}
{"text":"I really like the strawberry cornet pie. I keep coming back for more. The marinated beef bowel was great also come with a free ice tea or coffee . I highly recommend this place. You can sit outside and enjoy the show too."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Lattes were literally a dollar cheaper than  Starbucks back home - amazing in Vegas. They also have delicious pastries and some savory breakfast items (panini, mini pizzas etc.) for less than $4. If your are just looking for a lite, fast, breakfast, or just a good cup of coffee this is the way to go. In the canal street shops at St. Marks square. Its tucked away from the main casino so no long lines either!"}
{"text":"Not a whole lot of savory breakfast items for non-meat eaters. Not bad, but I'll go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Easily the best bakery in Chinatown. This bakery combines various ethnic foods into French baking. Their savory selection is just as prominent, and delicious, as it's sweet. We enjoyed the ham and cheese hasbrown sandwhich, the curry doughnut, and the polish sausage. The croinuts (sp?) were a yummy sweet treat! I will always \"want to go to there.\""}
{"text":"With so many fancy pastry shops between the Venetian and Palazzo, I was curious to see what Paris Baguette had to offer. They stay open until 11pm on week nights so I enjoyed a stroll through the Palazzo and visited PB a little after 10 pm on a night I got out of work early, rather than making a special trip to the Strip. It was not hard to find as I'm very familiar with St. Mark's Square, but the shop was smaller than expected. For some reason the photos had me anticipating a palace of pastries. My friend Jean posted some great photos. I was just looking for Fluffy Bear's photos but her account is gone. :(

The shop was filled with more employees than patrons as I took a few minutes to make my selections from the bakery cases. Everything looked pretty good, but nothing really caught my eye. The savory dishes looked weak. I placed a guava turnover and chocolate cream cheese bread on my tray and ordered a strawberry pudding and house iced coffee from the cashier. The total was around $15, which is average. The quality is higher than what you will find in Chinatown and the bread loaf was much larger than a single serving.

Initially feeling skeptical, I was very happy with my selections upon tasting! The house iced coffee was strong but sweet, and would have been better with a splash of black coffee to reduce the sugar. The turnover had crisp puff pastry and a nice guava filling. The chocolate bread was a cocoa-flavored yeast dough mixed with chocolate chips and pockets of cream cheese. I'd prefer more cream cheese, but after I toasted a slice and spread cookie butter on top, it was irresistible. The strawberry pudding is really cute and also really tasty. The burnt sugar sauce at the bottom of the jar makes me think of flan. Most importantly, baked items are prepared throughout the day, so everything I picked was fresh just before closing. There are date/time stamps and nutritional information beside the labels on the displays.

Overall, I was impressed with the unique pastry options at PB. It seems like a good location to meet an out-of-town visitor for a quick breakfast or lunch on the Strip."}
{"text":"I'm so sad that they stopped serving Poke Bowls. They were soooo delicious.....  also the cake section isn't as great. I went in to purchase a cake and all they had was 2 six inch cakes. This new management has made this place go downhill. I use to recommend to all my friends & family to come here for cakes & poke bowls but I won't anymore. I hate how places get new management & they go in & change everything."}
{"text":"3 stars for the service. 

If rates solely on food then 5 stars. 

Wanted breakfast so came here. Couldn't find it at first and had to call, it's inside the shopping center in the Venetian at st mark's square in the corner. 

One side is more savory and she was getting it set up. The other half of the store is dedicated to their pastries. Expensive but very good! 

Paid for some pastries, two coffee, and an available bowl. The lady that I took the order from me apparently didn't want to be there and looked like she hated life. After my order she tells one of the other two worker (without addressing their name) to make my acai bowl. Either the other chick heard it or pretended she didn't hear it but no one made my bowl AND forgot my hazelnut coffee. 15 mins go by.... I asked for my food and she was dumbfounded by my question then asked the chick if she made my bowl. She looked like a deer in the headlights. Ugh, annoyed at this point, asked for a refund but it might've been a too complicated task so I just asked for two fruit bowls. 

Meh."}
{"text":"Super excited to come here and sadly realized my expectations were too high. Service was great...it was just the pastries that were a bit tough. Maybe because we went in the evening and they'd been out all day?"}
{"text":"I would give this place a hundred stars if I could. I work for a convention in the Venetian twice a year and I am SO HAPPY this place is here now because it's AMAZING. The avocado toast, strawberry tiramisu, chocolate mousse cake, basically everything is amazing !!!!"}
{"text":"Came a year ago and everything was fantastic. This time around, the food was horrible. Had this location gone downhill?"}
{"text":"Came in here at 8:30 pm to get a poke bowl and they did not even have crab meat or nori. If they stop serving poke at 10 pm and you expect to have the crab meat they advertise that comes with your bowl then it's definitely a disappointment. 

My fiancé ordered a large bowl and while we were picking the protein he asked the server if he could pick three different kinds of protein, she said no you get two but you get three with a large. Then she was like oh you wanted a large? We definitely ordered a large before that but I guess her mind was elsewhere. Then we asked about the crab meat and she said that they ran out of crab meat which they advertise comes with your bowl. Proceeding to when we picked toppings and we asked for nori. She then opens cabinets looking for the nori and says I don't think we had nori today. Ok you don't have nori the whole day when it's clearly on the menu for toppings? At that point I didn't even order one for myself.

I know it's not their specialty being that it's a French place but if you're going to try to advertise and sell something, at least do it right."}
{"text":"Great selection and competitive prices. We had a mozarella onion bread, a ham and cheese croissant, a garlic croissants  (the best I have ever had) and a guava pastry.  Everything was fresh, tasty and good! The guava pastry was the best I have had...and I always try guava pastries everywhere I go!"}
{"text":"Poke Bowl
You can't tell from the outside but there is a POKE bowl place inside this Baguette shop! The poke bowl was pretty decent considering it isn't Hawaii.  It is set up like Chipotle or MOD Pizza.  It is a few sizes with prices and lots of toppings to choose from.  You get to choose all your ingredients for a poke bowl, whether that is gluten free or not.  They have a choice of salad or rice as a base and they have a variety of toppings available for you to add to your customized bowl of delight.  The sauces are alright and the fish quality and quantity is okay.  It is a great price for Vegas since everything is expensive.

{"text":"We were strolling the Paris Hotel and decided to stop by here. I was not impressed at all with this place. Their pastries look delicious but unpar with its taste. 

I had: 
- Caramel Latte $7: dissapointed on their coffee drinks. I had to wait 15 minutes for my drinks and I was not sure what kind of coffee beans they used, but I could only taste the sweetness and not the coffee. I also did not smell the coffee aroma at all. 
- Chocolate Croissant $4: two thumbs down, it did not taste like a fresh made one. Tasted like a cheap chocolate and the pastry was soggy. Not even close with some of my favorites local bakeries in town. 
- Portugese sausage bun with corn $4: it was okay. The sausage was small and the cream corn taste like it was from a can. 
- Macaroons $5: I found their plastic-taste macaroons was detestable! I felt like I ate a playdough. It was hideous. 

They had couple tables on the second floor available with the view of the square. That was the only highlight of the day. 

This place will not be getting a second visit from me."}
{"text":"Perfect for a quick lunch and sweet treat at the Venetian. Great turkey avocado sandwich. Sit upstairs and you get a nice view of the canal shoppes."}
{"text":"Paris Baguette at the Venetian shops/ St Marks square is a comfortable and quiet spot to unwind and visit with friends. They have sandwiches, pasta salads, and heavenly pastries here."}
{"text":"Been coming here a few times. a little over price compare to the one inside ranch 99, but the quality of the pastries and bread are great. service is also good"}
{"text":"Love the view from upstairs overlooking St. Mark's square at this Paris Baguette inside Venetian. I'm used to smaller Paris Baguettes in Los Angeles so was pleasantly surprised to see the offerings here. They replaced the poke bar with kbbq rice/salad bowls and have an impressive selection of savory options including panini/sandwiches. I  recommend the pastrami panini along with their house iced coffee. It's a tad sweet but half black + half house iced coffee did the trick. The cakes looked great and are also available by the slice. My go to flavor in ktown is blueberry chiffon!"}
{"text":"Paris Baguette specializes in sweet treats that'll send you straight to Cloud 9 after your first bite :)

I always recommend first-timers to try a slice of their fresh strawberry cream cake. It tastes like dollops of vanilla cream sandwiched between pillows of fluffy sponge cake, layered with juicy strawberries to brighten the taste.

Their matcha, chocolate, and blueberry chiffon cakes are also elegant and delicious.

PB's desserts are much better than the dry & overly sweet monstrosities served at Carlo's Bakery across the Grand Canal Shoppes. Truly the most underrated cakery on The Strip!!"}
{"text":"Not even two months later, I feel like they are starting to slack. Customer service has been sub-par lately. It seems like a month after their grand opening, I see most, if not all new workers. And not for the better either. I work here on property so I come here pretty often for their lunch sandwiches and/or coffee drinks. 

A few occasions, I see at least 4 workers behind the counter and us customers have a line forming. They were all talking to each other...laughing and chatting. And yet.....they somehow forgot they have customers to attend to. Were we invisible or something?

A few times, my coffee drink wasn't completely filled up to the brim. I'm sorry but when you charge me $6+ dollars for a small 12 oz coffee, I expect 12 ounces of coffee in there. (see pic attached.) Not too pleased with that. 

They got their work cut out for them especially since we have some big conventions coming to town with CES and SHOT Show. If they're slacking now....oh yeah...they're in for a rude awakening. Please improve on your customer service!"}
{"text":"Taste is ok, size is normal, but pricey.
I bought sweet rice donuts and small ball that's inside potato cheese, they put one bag together, all where sugar around potato cheese one.
That's I didn't like."}
{"text":"A variety of tasty eats and treats.  It does remind me of a Paris style baguette place. A cool feature is you can create your own Poke bowl. Yums!!! 

I ordered the maple glazed bacon melt sandwich with a freshly squeezed orange juice which comes in a funky take home glass bottle on cork. My husband ordered his latte.

If your looking for a quick honest eat for anytime of the day, this place is a great go-to snake for sit-in or take-out."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this chain bakery shop. We came in around 6pm and there wasn't much to choose in the bakery section. But luckily they did still have the cakes & baumkuchen. 

Unfortunately they didn't accept the stamps reward card yet. The inside is smaller than the other PB from their cities."}
{"text":"Passed by this place and was super excited to try. Finally stopped this morning and was a bit disappointed. Customer service is a huge factor in me returning and this place failed me. Stood in front of the registers for a few minutes and no one so much as glanced my way. I walked around a bit then came back to the counter, again nothing. I finally asked if they were open and it wasn't until then that anyone spoke. By then I was a bit annoyed and just grabbed a cup of coffee. Their hazelnut fresh brew was great, but I am sad to say I wont be going back even if their pastries look delicious."}
{"text":"We went there to get some desserts after dinner. Everything is good. I recommend the strawberry fresh cake and the cheese cake. 
But for those who are allergic to regular eggs because they have antibiotic, these cakes are not for you. My mom is one of them and she got sick after ate there. We called and asked the bakery whether the use organic eggs; but no. We found out the hard way. Good luck."}
{"text":"Nice selection of eye catching pastries in a lovey setting. The pastries are expensive, of course, you are at the Venetian. The quality is middle of the road and the service is absolutely substandard."}
{"text":"When this place first opened my husband and i were there for 2 weeks straight. Its a really good bakery. Its not as cheap as others but its one of those fancy bakeries. Customer service is sometimes slow but nothing too bad that ever ticked me off. They have a great variety of bread to choose from and bread you can't find anywhere else. My favorite is the curry ball, ham and cheese panini and sausage inside the bread. Would i never liked os that the bread is cold. You would think they have some special lamps to keep it warm but its so cold sometimes. Never been offered to warm them up. The ice coffee is delicious and well balanced between sweet and bitter from the coffee. Another thing to point out is i wish they were on top of cleaning the tables after customer leave. Sometimes there's like 5 tables empty but they're all dirty. Overall something about them makes me keep my review at 4 stars, its not a bad place and i love the bread."}
{"text":"The customer service is HORRIBLE, I don't think I will come back. I rather go to a  diff  coffee shop with great customer service and pastry! I paid cash and the lady who helped me asked for another bill coz there's a tear, I told her to tape it but she ignore me, that is so rude! The counter top where they make coffee is dirty and messy as well as the table we sat on."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a go-to bakery for a while, and I finally found one. The price is fairly priced and the baked goods are AMAZING.  They have a great house coffee that o recommend too."}
{"text":"I stopped by around 9pm on a Saturday night and I honestly liked the place itself. The bakery definitely introduces a new concept when it comes to choosing your pastries because you have to grab a tray and tong and select your own pasties. (((If you have seen the bakeries in any Korean dramas, it's exactly the same))). When I came at this time, they didn't have much in stock and they close at 11 so I was a little surprised. The food are definitely instagrammable but I haven't had the chance to taste most of the pastries/drinks/desserts. 

I give this place 3 stars because I found most of their items slightly overpriced in comparison to other bakeries I have been to in Chinatown. They also don't have a wide selection for drinks - just the basics.

I would definitely go back to this place but probably when they're not so new anymore."}
{"text":"I went, and I'm underwhelmed.

It was my first PB experience. I might have been anticipating for this too much. I love Asian bakeries in general. And not having to go all the way to the strip (in Venetian) and stay within my comfort zone (Chinatown) was a plus.
The appearance of the store sure has promising Asian Bakery feel. Glass case full of familiar pastries, like red bean bun, croissants, and of course, baguettes in a basket, self-service trays and tongs.

They have plenty of room behind the cashier to work and walk around, yet they are scrambling in there; one trying to serve drink, the other trying to reach plates placed above espresso machine or one of the machines there, all while sandwich staff chatting and looking into the store through their cold case of sandwich ingredients. 

On to the food; I've tried Mocha cake, red bean bun, mini croissant, mini mochi donut.
They are nice, good tasting, but none of them exceeds anything you can get from other local bakeries in the area.

Eat-in area is not big, and unattended. So you might find a table, but most likely you'd have to brush off crumbs left by people before you, if you want to eat there.

I might go back again, later, just to see if there's anything I missed in my first visit. But, I'm good for a while."}
{"text":"I love Paris baguette. I've found this place in la. Fell in love and never went back to la. The depression sank in and I craved their crime brûlée bonebones, they delicious croissants and their amazing sausage pastries. I travel to San deigo a ton and when they opened one there I was ecstatic. Months went by and I was content but really missed their amazing products, but by accident walking through the grand canal shops I see their logo out of the corner of my eye. Heaven has made its way to Las Vegas and with more options! The prices are extremely reasonable. Especially for the strip a pastry is between 3-5 dollars. I got a sandwich (9.95) a bit steep. It was the pastrami havarti I wish their was more it was so delicious it disappeared before I realized I consumed it all. The wait was not half bad and considering it was ces weekend and they are two months old they were true champs during the rush and getting sold out of product unable to keep up with the demand, I now have a reason to come to the strip more frequently to fill my Paris baguette cravings!"}
{"text":"It was as if an angel released it's essence into my mouth. It was like having the gods bake divine energy into your soul. It was like breaking bread with the ghost of Steve Jobs. What I'm trying to say is that I really liked it."}
{"text":"Tastes like LA but costs like a premium hotel. 
Americano was weak and watery but the staff was generous and added a double shot (which normally costs $4 more). 
Infringement pastries, ie creme brûlée. 
There were a lot of samples of pastries and drinks. 
One Redeeming factor is the second floor dining area which overlooks the court and has a great view of the musical acts albeit from behind. The store music distracts during the show but is a welcome in the times in between.  
Overall a nice break from the hustle of the casino scene."}
{"text":"Wish it was better... coffee beans in my latte tasted burnt and the almond pastry tasted more greasy than almond-like."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas this past weekend. Unfortunately they stopped serving that raspberry chocolate pastry which was so delicious; instead, from the pastries this time I chose Opera chocolate cake, which I split into two pieces, but still couldn't finish my half.. as it was very poorly made and cream tasted like rich piece of cut BUTTER, which made me feel nauseous. Their cappuccino machine was broken so they were only offering regular coffee. :/
Sandwiches we had prior the cake tasted pretty good; however, I am so disappointed with the quality of that piece of cake that I'm going to lower my initial 5 star rating to 3*"}
{"text":"Modern & clean bakery close to the strip. They have the basic pastries like chocolate croissants, raisin bread, ham and cheese bread, and a variety of cake and cake slices. Great for a quick snack or breakfast stop with 6-7 small tables for seating. 


Note: Upon entering, look for a tray with tray liners and tongs to place your selection on."}
{"text":"Came here after having a great dinner with my husband. We wanted to take home pastries for our awesome siblings who watched our 1 year old so that we could have a date night. It's a new establishment so it was clean and neat. There are a few tables where you can hang out and/or study. It was around 9 pm when we got there so there was a lot of empty trays/shelves. Although there was still a variety of pastries left, many of them was on the savory side. I was there for the sweeter pastries. It's a cafeteria style bakery where you pick up a tray and a tong, and pick out your desired pastries. As we were going around, I noticed the signs didn't coordinate with the pastries so I was a bit confused. I asked a worker who was moving things around where this and that are. I guess that's what happens when you go late. It was ok though. Next to the cashier are a bunch of cake selection. As we were paying, the workers had their side conversations that was very difficult to ignore. Had they focused more on customer service, I would've went home with a green tea chiffon cake....which I am planning on going back for. :) the pastries that was bought was gone the very next morning. My family enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Very much run like an assembly line.  From what I could see of the staff, they were not very happy or enthusiastic.  In spite of the delicious array of pastry and drinks, it would be nice to get a bit of a smile when you get your first cup of coffee in the morning."}
{"text":"Ich gehe gerne zu Paris Baguette als Alternative zu Starbucks. Mittendrin im Las Vegas Venedig eine gute Gelegenheit für Essen, Kuchen und Cappuccino.
Preise wie in ganz Las Vegas eher am oberen Limit.
I like going to Paris Baguette as an alternative to Starbucks. Right at the center of Las Vegas Venice a good opportunity for food, cakes and cappuccino coffee.
Prices as in all of Las Vegas rather at the upper limit."}
{"text":"Poke bowl was delicious. Went back the next morning for coffee and pastries. Problem was, I wanted one of everything. So happy to find this little piece of heaven. One of my favorite places to eat while in Korea."}

{"text":"Great tea, coffee and pastries. However, terrible customer service owner was very rude to her employees and customers. It's average not on my top of the list although cute little set up but messes it up with the service."}
{"text":"The good and the bad. 

Located on the corner of Spring Mountain and Wynn. Plenty of parking and indoor seating. 

Decent prices and good fresh pastries and coffee just need better service. I usually just get a latte or get the mini croissants or popsicles. All the items I've got have been good. Fresh and flakey just right croissants, smooth tasty lattes, creamy popsicles. 

Service is just not that good though. I haven't been greeted when walking in but others coming in right after me were greeted in a different language. Lol. 
Never thanked or even get a while when I leave a tip. 
The first time I went they said the latte machine was down. I think they just cleaned it and were starting to shut down 30 minutes early. The manager was counting money at the cashier and didn't acknowledge me. He was just counting the minutes tell close. 

Little understaffed and not good teamwork. Stuff should be cleaned and refilled more. No trash can by the door which they had room for.

I'll likely be back often since it's blocks from my home and do enjoy the products."}
{"text":"Tried the earl grey fog latte and the custard pastry. Wish they had eclairs but what I had was amazing. 

Fruit on top was fresh and service was fast."}
{"text":"Paris Baguette is located in the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes in the indoor St Marks Square area where the living statue is stationed. Since they are newly opened, everything is still very clean, neat, and shiny. One long stool seating and a few tables in the square is available (great to watch the occasional show).

Our Order on 11/22/2015:
Pastrami & Hvarti
BLT
Cheese Dog
Guava Turnover
Split Polish Dog

We have quite a few PB in the bay area now and I noticed the pastries are different than the selection that was available here. I feel that the pastries are definitely more catered to European clientele as there aren't as many Asian flavors. I highly suggest getting the puddings in the tiny glass jars in the refrigerated section if they have them available. My favorite flavor is the Royal Pudding out of all the available flavors (cappuccino & strawberry are other options). Their cakes are as yummy as they look. 

Running short on time before our spa appointment and having not yet eaten lunch, my sister and I grabbed a few pastries and sandwiches to dull our hunger a little till our reservation for high tea. Enjoyed watching the silent jesters performing in the square as we ate. Sandwiches were just ok. I'd stick to the pastries.

{"text":"Wow!  Who would have thought that a great French bakery would be located in the heart of Chinatown?  The savory cheese pastry is orgasmic.  My first time here I bought two croissants, one for me and one for my wife.  When I got home and she wasn't at home I devoured hers as well.  The selection of pastries is mind boggling.  The staff is very friendly and informative but the baguettes are to die for.  You can easily picture yourself on a parisan sidewalk sipping coffee and dreamily silflaying  on wonderful bread.  If you like pastries and French bread this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Ever since this place opened up, I haven't stopped coming here. I love how they're open early enough so I can make a stop here before work, as well as being open late, compared to the traditional hours of a bake shoppe.

It sits in the main Chinatown plaza, which is really close to The Strip. It's easy to find and parking is never a problem. The establishment's interior space is pretty small. So during their busy times, the place can get squishy and there are not that many tables and chairs to begin with.

Once you enter, you will see a set of reusable trays and tongs for customers to use. This makes it hygienic and easier to hold several pastries at a time as you're picking and choosing from the open display cases. My family's faves are the cream puffs, croissants, and strawberry cakes. Their house coffee is pretty good too.

Customer service hasn't really been a problem, but there are times when some employees could offer better service and be more appreciative when it comes to tips. I've seen it so many times where a customer will hand a tip directly to a worker and nothing will be said by the employee that is receiving it. No thank you, eye contact, or even a smile. Not really good mannerisms. :[

I love the convenience of the location, the hours, and selection of menu items, but customer service can be a lil bit better. The interior space could use some planning as well. But if you're in the area, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Finally a PB outside of Cali on the West Coast! 
I've seen this place under construction for months while visiting Vegas in the past but never got to see it open until today. Came by last night during a family triphowever they said it won't be open til the 18th. I came back this morning and the interior is simply beautiful! Being a loyal customer, I noticed that they used a different theme for this store than the usual cool blue and grey colors at SoCal stores. This store actually has two-stories, where customers can sit and watch the mini opera going on downstairs in St. Mark's Square! So Clever. The store itself is actually located in the middle of St. Mark's, next to Pandora. 
My mom and I split a grilled four cheese sandwich and a grilled chicken, bacon, and brie. The grilled cheese comes on a regular whole wheat toast, while the latter on a baguette. They were both tasty and rich, and I noticed that their baguette tastes much better toasted than not from the sandwich. We also shared a lemon spritzer and cafe mocha. The baristas were friendly and they even drew a heart on my latte, which was a nice gesture. I'm definitely coming back here on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is a smaller version of Paris Baguette.  They have 1/2 the baked goods of larger stores.  The good thing is they are going to be adding off strip locations which should be larger and have all the normal baked goodies.
    One other thing is the prices are on the high end due to the location.  I don't remember them being expensive for the normal items I get.  The daughter loves the hot dog breads which she said were pretty awesome.  They don't carry the curry bread due to their small size.  I think another factor is the clientele.  
   A great spot to pick up a unique snack while you are at the Sands Expo.   Looking forward to the off strip locations opening."}
{"text":"It's not same as Korea and even LA ones are better then this place. It's not worth your money when you have better places around Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Located in Chinatown plaza (Ranch 99 market) all kinds of delicious pastries, sandwiches, cake, and a coffee menu!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a Poke bowl here.  I love Poke bowls, but as far as they go, the ones we got from Paris Baguette were decent, but certainly not great and probably not even good.  At best, average.

If that were the end, I would give it three stars.  But there are several things that drop it down 1/2 star each, all the way down to one star.

First, we waited in line approximately 1/2 hour on a Monday after 1:00 p.m.  This was not a holiday or anything.  Just really slow service and not enough people.  (I was craving a Poke bowl, though, so we waited.)

Second, the prices were too high.  A good Poke bowl almost anywhere is around $'10.  Here, they charge $13 for the large (which is a normal bowl anywhere else), and they are super stingy with the fish.  I asked for tuna as one of my proteins, and I got exactly 3 tiny pieces of tuna.  It wasn't just me -- they were super stingy on everyone's bowl.  And then I got a plastic bottle of Coke.  $3.  You've got to be kidding.

Third, when I got to the register and started to pay, my wife noticed that they had tacked on an extra charge (I think $1.25) for avocado.  Neither of us got avocado.   When my wife called the cashier out on it, I was expecting a look of \"whoops, it looked like there was avocado, sorry for the mistake.\"  Instead, the look on the cashier's face was, \"whoops, I just got caught taking a cookie from the cookie jar I knew I wasn't supposed to touch.\"  The look on her face screamed out that she knew exactly what she had done.  If you go here, pay very careful attention to what they are charging you for.  Judging by the guilty look on the cashier's face, I suspect I'm not the only one she's tried this on.

Fourth, we asked for soy sauce, and the cashier said they don't have soy sauce.  That's just weird.  Especially because we found soy sauce in the condiments rack upstairs.

Fifth, we ate upstairs.  Don't make the same mistake.  The upstairs seating area is a total dump.  Sit outside the store in the canal area instead.

If you are Jonesing for a Poke bowl and can tolerate all these problems, the Poke bowl isn't horrible, and there aren't many Poke bowl places nearby.  Just make sure you set aside plenty of time to stand in line, check your receipt carefully to ensure you aren't overcharged, sit outside the store, ignore the cashier's claim that they don't have the condiments you want, and be prepared to pay too much for a Poke bowl.  Other than that, it's OK."}
{"text":"Love how it's in the middle of palazzo and Venetian. Great place for dessert and entertainment!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan.  I'm in search for awesome fruit tarts.  Here, I didn't get a \"fruit tart\" per se, but I did get a fruit \"pastry\".  Same concept as a tart but this one is settled in a flaky delicious pastry.  I loved every bite of it.  My brother ordered, I think the coffee bun and he said that was awesome.

If you're a fruit, tarty kind of person, try this fruit pastry.  I hope you like it.

The employees here are super friendly.  I love how they have free samples.  That a plus ;D

I'll definitely be back here to try all their other goodies.  With that being said, happy eatings! @~~}~~~~"}
{"text":"Flies inside the bakery case.  They need to better take care and be mindful of neat organization and keeping things sanitary at this location!   I was really excited to grab couple breads and desserts here for late night snacking.  PB happens to be one of my favorite bakeries and have been to all of California's location. I came in here with the same level of expectations only to be really disappointed with the stores overall cleanliness and being turned off by fruit flies sitting on top of baked goods!  My husband and my in laws were instantly turned off by this scene and quickly ran out of the store.  My in laws have never been to PB and after hearing highly praised things from me wanted to try it. What a disaster!"}
{"text":"While working in South Korea, this place was goto place for breakfast pastry and Southern California location were also good but this Paris Baguette in Venetian Resort in LV was just okay and the staffs were not friendly as other places.  I'll give one more try before I leave here."}
{"text":"I have never been soooo excited over pastries! 

I went simple with a Large Latte and a Chocolate croissant! I didn't realize I was going to heaven with these choices. The coffee could of been hotter but the croissant was just ridiculous out of this world!!!! 

First bite was this buttery, nutty, soft heavenly taste of what a croissant should taste like accompanied my perfectly sweetened chocolate and sweet melt in your mouth crunch light too glaze that just melted at a more simple enjoyable pace than cotton candy and no where near sweet as that. 

I cannot get over the simplicity in that chocolate croissant and how mind blowing it was. I will forever come here! 

The only thing I wish is that they were open earlier like 5 am or 6! That would be amazing. 

Can't wait to taste the rest! 

A fan!"}
{"text":"I had a croissant for breakfast. I wanted to eat more than one. They taste so good. The texture is soft and flaky. They melt in your mouth. I will try not to eat too much."}
{"text":"This bistro casually located in St. Mark's Square is a secret to be explored and exposed! 

Fun, busy pastry type of a store. Their cappuccinos were outstanding, Immediately I was transformed to our experience in Italy- the whole ambiance was very much like the original St. Mark's experience! 
Then we ordered sandwiches. Whoa! Absolutely delish!!!!!! 

Fresh bread, the sandwiches were toasted to perfection without compromising the integrity of the bread or ingredients, the cheese was melted perfectly and creamy and did I say deliciousness was exuding with each bite???

Our experience was further improved, not only by the wonderful staff and pleasantries in general, but also as we watched actors walking by with their Carnival outfits and face masks! Venice was brought to life with sounds, views, and tastes!!!! 

Excellent pastries, great food, coffees, and prime location! Do visit it!"}
{"text":"This place was a disappointing ....small assortment of pastries compared to all the Paris Baguettes I went to."}
{"text":"For those that do not know, Paris Baguette is a hugely successful bakery in South Korea with thousands of locations. They try to emulate a french bakery with some Korean influence particularly with Red Bean and Mochi. For those from California, Paris Baguette is not a big deal as there are many locations particularly in Koreatowns in LA and SJ. However, I was excited to learn Vegas was getting one but then finding out it was in the Venetian.

Luckily, the bakery has opened a location in the Chinatown Mall Plaza near Ranch 99. They have fresh baked bread daily, a large selection of coffee and tea drinks, as well as cakes, macaroons, and ice cream selections.

Since Paris Baguette carries the same breads from store to store for the most part, I knew what to expect when going here. Every pastry I've had has met or exceeded my expectation of quality. It's notable that getting bread here early is better than late. The later in the day, the drier the bread may be.

I've had the raisin bread sliced loaf, blueberry cream pastry, several croissants, mochi donut and pastry, as well as a hashbrown pastry with ham and cheese in it. Everything was really delicious. Perhaps more importantly, their 'sweet' choices aren't overwhelmingly so.

I've also gotten to eat a couple of their cake slices, all of which were very moist and tasty. I'll definitely be a regular here particularly for the pastries.

They had their grand opening on the weekend of the 19-21st, so I managed to snag one of their insulated lunch bags too."}
{"text":"different from the typical PB.  if you come in the AM look for the items made fresh that day.  most are not. ham and cheese croissant too soft and sweet"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant at the canal shops area at the Venetian hotel.
We went there for breakfast a couple of times and the food was amazing. 
Their croissant , cakes everything in the bakery was mouth watering.

Lovely ."}
{"text":"I've been a long time costumer of Paris Baguette in the locations at NYC. I'm not sure if I came here on a wrong day, but the poke bowl was god awful. The ponzu sauce was so salty and spicy that I had to throw out half the poke bowl even after trying to wash it down with their lackluster coffee. The portion size was SOO small, I had the option to choose two proteins and I asked for two portions of salmon instead and got two tiny scoops. Small selection of toppings and everything was just so unpleasing. Especially paying $12 for it. The salmon was fresh, that's about it. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Always a good place for that sweet cravings...good to see we have it now in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This is not a fresh bakery. It is a chain and the bake goods taste like it. I had their chocolate cake that reminded me of a Pananeria. It's not my cup of tea. I like 20 + layered croissants. This is nothing like that. The only thing French is that they have croissants."}
{"text":"I love Paris baguette!! I dont like the one in Venetian hotel in terms of location & variety of the breads.
This 2nd location is perfect for me. Try their castera, chestnut roll, toast bread and so on."}
{"text":"Found this spot via John Curtis.  Love, Love, Love the lemon macaroons here!  Better than the pricier, French macaroons at the mall. 
Also the mini rice donuts are soft and chewing and simply delicious.  
When you walk in, grab a tray, piece of wax paper, and tongs and start shopping.  The whole experience was different than the typical vegas bakery.  
Well done Paris Bakery, well done. And another home run for John Curtis."}
{"text":"They are located in the center of St. Mark's Square, part of the Grand Canal Shoppes (2nd level retail) in the Venetian.  it's the perfect place to grab and go.

Experience delicious French pastries, desserts, specialty drinks, coffee, salads and sandwiches. I was surprises about their \"make-it-your-way poke bowls.\" 

Paris Baguette is a trend setting café that offers a unique experience providing stunning views of St. Mark's Square in their two story franchise and is available for catering and private parties."}
{"text":"3/5 stars: not bad, but nothing special; it's just A-OK. 

While vacationing in Vegas, I was excited to see the familiar Paris Baguette that I always visit when I'm in New York. This branch is definitely smaller and more limited in what they sell, but the food never disappoints. I got a croissant around 4 pm, which was still semi-fresh, and the price was reasonable (expensive, yes, but it's Vegas, after all!). I also purchased their freshly-squeezed orange juice, probably because the packaging was irresistible, and for ~$6, I got to drink something that felt healthier than a lot of other food options in Vegas. The atmosphere was brightly lit and inviting, and from afar you'd think it is really clean, but it was a bit too dirty for my liking, with straw wrappers, napkins, sugar, and coffee stains on the table. I wasn't sure why it wasn't cleaned up, since it pretty empty, but it's no big deal. I enjoyed finding a cute little place to rest and snack at after walking all day! It's refreshing to know that amidst all the crazy, fried, heavy food in Vegas, you can come to a quieter, healthier place. Plus, you can sit outside the bakery and enjoy frequent quartets and plays!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever, the cafe opened at 8 am , I just wanted a Cappuccino and they said , Cappuccino is served from 12 pm ... worst place ever for customer service ... not like"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Everything I tried was fresh and delicious!  You must try.. and sit upstairs to see the view over the canal shops."}
{"text":"Carmel latte was great. I wanted fat free milk but they ran out. I was there around 9 am and was surprised they didn't have any fat free milk."}
{"text":"Very fluffy croissant and good coffee. Not a long line at 9am on Sunday. Good for morning bites if you are staying at Venetian"}
{"text":"In general, this is a solid pastry place with coffee offerings and other baked goods (cakes mostly) plus sandwiches. But during a convention hosted in the Venetian, this place is the best. Also killer view of the grand canale restaurants when you sit upstairs. 

If you're staying in the venetian, it's a great place to enjoy coffee and pastries or grabbing something quick. I personally love the croissants and house iced coffee which has a hint of hazelnut? And I really love the upstairs seating where you can people watch and enjoy the fake almost real looking sky. 

But why I really decided to review this place is because of a recent convention I had here. I attended AWS annual conference which had what seemed like thousands of people all crowded up in the Venetian Convention Center. 

Conventions usually start in the morning and everyone needs their coffee/quick breakfast. Right below this place is Starbucks and it's the closest Starbucks to the Venetian convention center. So that means, the Starbucks had a line like you would not believe... And not just morning but all day. So what do you do? Wait for eternity or suck it up OR go to Paris Baguette. Located right above the Starbucks via an easy elevator or escalator. The prices are comparable and Paris Baguette has way more options for food!

So secret pro tip for conventioners, skip the Starbucks like and head upstairs for Paris Baguette."}
{"text":"We fell in love with this place. It's located inside Venetian hotel canal shoppes. You really feel like you are in Europe. The restaurants have that exact lighting that they use in Europe.
The pastries look shiny, colorful & glazed & most importantly they are DELICIOUS. 
We ordered the berry tart, berry waffle, almond pastry. Also the latte & cappuccino were perfect.  The berry waffle was swirled with chocolate & had a very yummy homemade wipe cream on it. It tasted really perfect.
Then we ordered the mozzarella sandwich, it was Devine!!! I think I died went to heaven & came back with every bite. 
I highly recommend this Restuarant. I wish they would open one near us in Palis Verdes. We don't have a great French bakery/Restuarant near us."}
{"text":"1st time and I already love it !! Price is low !! 
This time I just take and to go buy next time I will sit down inside they do have few tables 
One think , I just don't like the location . It kind hard to get in because the store is the end ... but I still go :)"}
{"text":"Very amazing pastries and smoothies  and coffee.  The worst thing for you but how can you resist the Amazing pastry aromas just fumigating the air with delicious baking aromas. Very low key but a nice treat. It's hard to just have one pastry. We bought several to try. No disappointments they were yummy.."}
{"text":"Yum!!! The pastries are so good! The croissants are very fluffy and light, but very filling. I really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Cute bakery located inside the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes. 

Bright, clean, organized display case. Daily assortments of baked goods. Lunch items looked great but I didn't order any. Several tables/chairs outside bakery to enjoy your purchases. Again, great ambiance whilst shopping in Grand Canal.  

I ordered 4 pastries and 24 oz iced coffee - great flavor/texture on pastries. Coffee was smooth, not overly bitter or roasted."}
{"text":"It has been over 18 years since last time I set foot in Las Vegas, early this year, when we did have a short stay for 1 night on the way to Grand Canyon, we didn't venture out to Vegas Strip though...so I had no idea what to expect this time when we returned for a 5-day stay. 

Definitely the food prices are not what they used to be, and yes, it was a shock to me to pay almost $6.00 for a cup of \"just coffee\" at Starbucks right on the Strip. Then I discovered Paris Baguette inside The Venetian at St. Mark's Square where a lot of tourists dine along the Canal Shops. Paris Baguette is tucked away in the corner and they have many different choices of breakfast, lunch, dinner and pastries, a very Bistro type of place. Upscale, nope, but it fits the bill for me.... I found it interesting because it is in \"The Venetian\", but it is called \"Paris Baguette\"...Anyhu, they were offering their \"just coffee\" for $1 in the month of Sep, so every morning after hubby went to his classes, I would walk across the street to P.B. to have my coffee and morning pastries to start my day, all under $4.00 instead of $15 for a plate of scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and a piece of toast + $4.50 for a cup of coffee in my hotel (TI). Yes, there are still good deals to be had, you will just have to look a bit harder for it. I am glad I did.  The only thing I haven't yet tried is their Cheesecake ! Until next time, P.B. !"}
{"text":"I would recommend their eclairs, as they are delicious, but still not the same as the real Parisian ones. Other deserts are average."}
{"text":"The pastry looks delicious, but everything was overpriced.  The tart was fresh and tasty, though."}
{"text":"I called because I needed a birthday cake quickly. Hector was so nice and set the cake aside so it was ready by the time I got there.  Their cakes are so moist and delicious. The cakes are not overly sweet and are just so beautiful. I got the berry cake with cream."}
{"text":"Love love love Paris Baguette! Went for the first time on a visit in San Jose and fell in love, when I heard they were putting in a space in Chinatown I was super stoked! Me and my boyfriend have been twice already since they've opened their doors and will be repeat customers for sure. When they have it in, the curry croquettes are the best thing you'll ever put in your mouth! 10/10 reco to stop in for a sweet or savory treat!"}
{"text":"We passed few bakeries and coffee shops this morning and stopped by here in hopes of quality cappucino and croissants. We weren't too impressed with either.  Croissants were not bad, but not something equivalent to those in Paris... 
The cappuccino however had too much milk and was too dilute,  i could barely taste the espresso.
If you are passing by maybe ok for something quick,  but nothing special."}
{"text":"I love this chain. I became a fan of it when I was visiting at LA Korea town. I'm glad they opened one here. Get there super early if you can to get fresh of the oven stuff. They are pretty darn amazing!"}
{"text":"Poke bowl was plentiful, delicious and reasonably priced for vegas. Exceeded my expectations. Also Paris baguette always has the best pastries."}
{"text":"Had the pastrami baguette and Hawaiian sausage sandwiches were delicious. And a price performer for a quick relatively inexpensive lunch compare to other options at the Venetian and Palazzo hotels and Grand Canal Mall."}
{"text":"Paris Baguette is a French style chain bakery in CA, NY and even on the strip at the Venetian. Call it French style all you want, but it reminds me of a Japanese bread store more than anything (doesn't help that it's in Chinatown too!) Grab a tray and some tongs and try all of the breads... but not the cream ones. 
Tried 10 different breads and the mont blanc pastry was the best BY FAR. They do a decent job of the pastries, croissants, etc but they fail when it comes to custard cream. Skip anything with a cream filling. 
MONT BLANC PASTRY. MONT BLANC PASTRY. so, so good. 
At 2-3$ per pastry, it is a little pricier than what I'm used to paying at Japanese bread stores, but with zero competition in the city, I'm down to pay it. 
They have a decent selection of individual cake slices and full cakes."}
{"text":"After all the positive reviews I've been reading and seeing all the pictures, all I can say is eh. It's not horrible, but it's not amazing like some other people make it out to be. 

First off all, their selection is tiny and I expected way more. We walked in and the first thing I said was, \"this is it?\" Everything they had on display just wasn't appealing to me. There were quite a few croissant options, some savory breads and a few others that were quite forgettable. I settled on a croissant and the strawberry pudding that was in the refrigerated display. The croissant was pretty standard. If it wasn't for that super delicious strawberry pudding, this review would have been 2 stars. 

The layout is pretty awful too. If there would be a line (thank goodness there wasn't when we visited), no matter what direction it went in, it would be blocking something. There's just no space. The cashier did not look like she wanted to be there. And the male employee that was boxing up my pastries was taking his sweet time. I was getting so frustrated watching him SLOWLY put everything in a box that I just wanted to say screw it and leave. 

I was pretty over this place before I even walked out. Like I said, if it wasn't for that yummy strawberry pudding, there's no reason for me coming back."}
{"text":"I visited this location for the first time last week while attending a tradeshow at the Sands.  Very appealing ambiance as you walk in...  Loved the fresh offerings.  I ordered the Mediterranean Bowl and a Fresh Grapefruit Juice.  They had all of the items except for the Cilantro for the bowl.  I told them that was fine.  The bowl was good overall...  too much sauce so I would have them put less next time.  Lunch was over $20+ for just that so it is a bit pricey - FYI.  No soft drinks served which is why I opted for the Grapefruit Juice.  Very good choice...  I was able to take most of it with me and enjoy later."}
{"text":"Cute little dessert place I would have to say. I wanted to try the egg tart here but there was only 3 left and it didn't look good. So I got the chocolate strawberry cake. This dessert looked pretty. I wish the cake was a bit more sweeter. The whip cream on it was good but if I could, I would want it sweeter. The chocolate was kind of bland to my tasting. It needed more flavor. I enjoyed the fruits in it. The inside of the dessert place was organized and cleaned. Their cakes looked very appealing here. I would say more sweet please! :-)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this Paris Baguette location ever since I moved to Las Vegas. I lived in South Korea for a while, and Paris Baguettes are plentiful over in Seoul. I'm not sure if it's because this location is in the Venetian, but the selection isn't as great as other Paris Baguette locations. There is an adequate selection of cakes, pastries (both sweet and savory), and sandwiches. I believe they just added a poke bowl option which I haven't tried yet, but seeing as Paris Baguette is geared more towards pastries/coffee, I'm hesitant to try it. It's like ordering the seafood at a steakhouse--it'll probably be decent but come on, it's not really why you're there.

I came specifically for milk bread and the cheesecake. They didn't have the milk bread which is disappointing, but I did get the cheesecake. They have the Korean/Japanese style of cheesecake where it is a lot fluffier/less dense than typical American cheesecakes. I personally prefer the Korean/Japanese style cheesecakes because they're more flavorful and the texture is so light. I also got several other things like the polish sausage with corn pastry, chocolate chip bread bowl, and the raspberry cream cheese danish. They're all pretty decent.


Reason for the 3 stars- I had the coffee offer from Yelp, and I showed mine and my friend's yelp app to the cashier, but he still charged me for the coffee. I don't think he heard me or realized that I had 2 yelp coffee offers, but I just paid it anyway since it's only $3 (which is only like 3 arizona iced teas--I just equate things in arizona iced teas to make me feel better about how much I had to pay). I took the $3 hit to my credit card because the cashier was already working hard and probably just forgot.

Overall, there's a decent coffee offer on Yelp, the upstairs seating has a good view, and the selection is sub par compared to other Paris Baguettes."}
{"text":"Was looking for a coffee shop to chill and stay away from the sun and came across this. I have seen this chain before but this is the first time I stopped by. Here is the breakdown:

FOOD/ DRINKS 

The drinks are good, standard coffee shop and the flavors are up to expectation-- no wow factor. The desserts have a great taste and selection. Great cakes and also the breads are pretty good there.

SERVICE

Ok employees, not rude, not super friendly, a bit shy. But the speed of service for my coffee was extremely high. There were two people ahead of us and we waited a long time to get our drinks. 

DECOR/ AMBIANCE

It is a nice bakery to be seating and enjoying your small dessert and your drink. Very clean space, and it is decorated according to its proposal. 

OVERALL

Nice coffee shop to stop by and enjoy a dessert."}
{"text":"A French bakery in Chinatown?! I was skeptical at first, but I was wrong! Their pastries are pretty good; and most surprisingly -in a good way- very light. We tried the Chocolate Strawberry cake and the strawberry mousse, if I were to compare it to a genuine French pastry I would say it's \"industrial pastry\" quality, not artisan, but for being in Las Vegas, not in France, I give them a lot of credit. My only reservation is the price; at $4.75 a small piece, I find it a little pricey. Didn't try the savory items, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Gorgeous Paris Baguette in the Venetian Canal shops! You can go upstairs and see a great view of the shops from up high!

The cream cheese donut we got was small and didn't have any cream cheese in the middle. We frequent Paris Baguette at home and was disappointed in how the cream cheese donut was made. Also, the guy who heated it up overheated it and it was super dry and not like our usual cream cheese donut.

We got an iced tea too and it was pretty good.


Do a Yelp Check-In for a free cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"Like what i said, my day is not complete if there's no sweet/carbs! Their cakes & cream fillings is not overwhelmingly sweet. Highly recommended is their Macarons, ham&cheese, cream puff, cakes , donut, & ice-cream & latte! I seldom review Bakery shops, but this Korean-French Pastry shop adds to my go to morning routine in the area of Spring Mountain! Price is reasonable, service is ok, but the staff needs to train well in using debit card payment. Personal tray were clean, could'nt be more pleased. I recommend go in the morning! & grab a fresh bake goodies!!!"}
{"text":"place is small compare to the one in sj"}
{"text":"Meh. Disappointing. Looks better on display than it really is. The cakes meh, sandwich ugh, croissant was good though."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries. Amazing breakfast and hang out place. I had been to one in Korea town in Los Angeles. I am so glad they have opened this one ! Never planning on having my breakfast anywhere else while in Vegas"}
{"text":"located in the heart of the Venetian shops right by the gondolas. 

for the whole month of September, a cup of coffee is only $1! And its GOOD!
the desserts were so delicious and we had some of the breakfast baked goods. 
You grab a tray and a pair of tongs and pick what you want. They will even heat up your items for you. 
Sit upstairs by the open windows where you will get an awesome view and you will get to see some of the shows they have downstairs in the courtyard.
this place was so good, we even came back another morning and we did not even stay at the Venetian. 
this place has friendly service, great coffee and a wide selection of desserts. Do come early, they run out of the good ones! My favorite was the blueberry/cream cheese pastry. Ham and egg was good too!
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Looking for the freshest food and delicious sandwiches?? You need to come check this place out! Yummy desserts and the atmosphere is on point! All my friends need to stop by here when you are in the Grand Canal Shops!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty pastries! Nice interior and you can watch the Venetian shows from the dining area on the second floor. This place is definitely going to start a new world for pastries and dessert!"}
{"text":"Beautiful pastries that make it hard to choose, which one to pick. Delicious sandwiches to go with your $1 cup of coffee. Upstair seating that lets you watch the terrific performances below you. Really hard to go wrong with this place. And the staff is friendly and helpful. Truly a great treat after a long walk around the strip."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????? Vegas ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"We came early in the morning to pick up pastries and lunch before heading to Valley of Fire.

Really interesting fusion bakery. There was a good selection of savory and sweet. The pastries were buttery and flaky and the proportion of filling to shell was on point.

We picked up - chocolate spiral, raspberry and cheese Danish, crab meat croquette (a little oily but yummy filling), sausage croissant, apple tart, deli meat sandwich.

We would happily go back for pastries but would skip the sandwich next time - it was ok, but there are better sandwiches for less nearby."}
{"text":"I come here very frequently on Sunday mornings and every time I come, this really cute cashier named Nilufer takes my order and makes me the best lattes!

The breads and pastries are always fresh and taste amazing. 

The mini sweet rice donuts are a must have. They're reallllllyyy good when hot. 

They're Americanos are really great too. The beans have a lot of flavor and don't taste burnt like Starbucks' coffee. 

If you want your food hot, don't hesitate to ask the cashier."}
{"text":"The people at Paris Baguette are very nice, welcoming, and helpful to every person who walks in. It's a little pricey but if you go upstairs the little sitting area is a hidden gem. It's very secluded and you can even see the bakers bake the pastries right in front of you. The upstairs lounging area overlooks the grand canal shoppes. You can even see a little bit of the gondolas. At about 9:30-9:45am, you can see the gondoliers sing in a line to their gondolas."}
{"text":"I was happy to find Paris Baguette opened in Vegas and located inside the Venetian/Palazzo Grand Canal Shoppes.

This is a smaller space than their traditional shops which limits the variety of baked goods and pastries that you would typically expect.

This being Vegas, they price much higher as well.

Interestingly enough, they also serve Poke here.  I suspect that this was added to increase revenue while commanding a small footprint.

They have a 2nd floor seating area that overlooks the court.

It's generally what you expect from this franchise."}
{"text":"So I woke up wanting to escape and knew going to the Paris Baguette would do it.
There are so many fresh pastries and baked goods to tickle your fancy.
The bacon & cheese melt wasnt bad and as I type this I nibble on their crab cakes.
The crab cakes are tasty at room temperature and I have a green onion to boot.. curbs the sweetness.
It's a small nook in the front of Chinatown plaza on Spring Mountain. It's always very clean and the food always looks so good you want everything.
I recommend this place for French goodies... Or what you would hope would be there. Polish sausage croissants to chocolate swirl, onion to berry, fruit tart s and cakes galore . Plenty of coffee options, and even a frozen section for looks to be amazing creamy goods...
Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"This Paris Baguette stands out from the hundreds of locations throughout the globe. It stands out on account of the fact that it overlooks St. Mark's Square and is a mile up a boulevard from the Eiffel Tower and practically across the street from Rome. Because of its unparalleled location, spending time in the Grand Canal Shops Paris Baguette is unique quality time. Throughout the year I have crossed Venice to appreciate unique quality time in this Parisan themed eatery. Although I visit throughout the year, my most treasured time spent here has been during the Christmas season when the Las Vegas Strip is transformed into a Christmas Winter Wonderland. It is the prime location adjacent to St. Mark's Square that has led me here from the grueling hot days of July to the jolly days of Christmas.

  Located a few feet from the statue performer and festivities in St. Mark's Square, this is a relatively large eatery that occupies two floors. The first floor is the Bakery. The second floor is the second floor lounge that overlooks St. Mark's Square and the kitchen. The stairs leading upstairs read off the ingredients one step at a time. Rising above the stairs the Paris Baguette mission statement reads, 

\" More than a bakery, more than a cafe. A wondrous place where making delectable treats has been a specialty for generations, and for decades has brought the magic of Paris to homes all over the world.\"

It is a magic that appears in the display cases throughout the first floor. These display cases feature magical breads and pastries, cakes, desserts, sandwiches, and specialty drinks including coffee. During the Christmas season, Holiday treats including gingerbread cookies join the line up. Following my written words my words through pictures describe the magical treats that Paris Baguette sells. Now I will describe the treats that I have devoured.

The word \"baguette\" means a long thin loaf of French bread. The bread that I devoured were more on the round side and sweet. During my visits, I had enjoyed their croissant, blueberry and cream cheese danish, and a Ganache choro bombo, amungst other treats. They are tasty treats that I am led to believe that their pastry chefs make in the kitchen on the second floor. With the food, I had perked up with a cup of coffee. During the past couple of years, the coffee has been a jolly good deal. That is because the Yelp Check-in offer made it free with a purchase. It is my understanding that their good coffee is Cafe Adagio. By the way, there have been times where I only brought their coffee that costs $3 to sip and savour a few feet away on a bench in Saint Mark's Square. One more time, I strive to enthasize that this  is a prime location in the Grand Canal Shops serving good products. 

It is in the second floor lounge where I had stepped out of the fast pace of the Las Vegas Strip to relax in a glorified balcony overlooking St. Mark's Square. I am amazed that a few people are aware of this spot. In the Christmas season, a Christmas tree at the corner created an extra touch of coziness. Cognizant of this cozy Parisan spot overlooking Venice, there had been instances where I escaped into the written words of a good book while seated on a comfortable chair. This is a cozy spot that also overlooks the hustle and bustle of the pastry chefs creating their magical treats. However, after the sun has set during the Christmas season, they have long left the building.

Knowing in the back of my mind that 2017 will soon be transitioning into 2018, my intention was to write what is possibly my ultimate review of the year on a unique business. In conclusion, the Grand Canal Shops Paris Baguette serves good food that is the admission to a seat in an exceptional location.

Happy New Year! May 2018 be fantastic.

............. 
Below are my words through pictures on this Paris Baguette."}
{"text":"Excellent casual lunch spot. It has a 2nd fl area with some tables overlooking one of The Venetian plazas.  Good sandwiches and poke bowls. Pastries look good, but we didn't try them. Food definitely has a slight Asian influence."}
{"text":"Woohoo! No more bread hogging everytime I go to LA! The interior is definitely different from the SoCal stores. It is much more modern and organized. Even the uniforms are cuter! They don't have a wide selection of pastries nor do they sell loaf bread but I am pleased to have at least something in town. They need to bring in the blueberry yogurt cake and the milk loaf breads!!  My friend who came during grand opening said everything was kind of salty(?) but I enjoyed all my pastries!

Service was honestly frustrating. They charged us for a random drink and when we confronted them about it, the girl was upselling it to us by dragging on how she has to \"void the entire ticket and then re-do our purchase so..do you want to take the drink?\" I understand that it's a pain to go through that process but that choice is up to us if you guys made a mistake. We just ended up taking it and throwing it out because she seemed like she had better things to do but we wasted $8.."}
{"text":"Had the grilled chicken caprese sandwich, bread is soft  really yummy and I want to try some of their pastries and desserts, they have a LOT of variety. Customer service could use a boost but food is yummy and affordable."}
{"text":"I have to say I have mixed feelings about this small French style coffee shop. First off, the coffee was excellent. It was fresh brewed with quality coffee beans. I also had the grilled cheese sandwich. I must say, it started out well. It had a variety of artisan cheeses and was very large. But unfortunately, the entire middle was cold. It was not heated or toasted long enough. With that said, I'd say my experience was 50-50. Maybe if I tried this place next time, they would cook the food to the appropriate temperature. But the coffee, definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have very delicious Asian style breads! Especially in Vegas, this is a great place to have a quick breakfast or a light brunch! Their service is also good!"}
{"text":"Amazing pastry and coffee. I had the croissant donut and an iced coffee. Both were very delicious. One downside was that they charge $4 for water... If you're feeling hungry for dessert or some sweets, stop in!"}
{"text":"My family got this cake for my birthday and everyone loved it. It was not over sweet, and the cake was amazing! We will definitely come back for some more."}
{"text":"A large variety of sandwiches, coffee drinks and beautiful pastries. The coffee latte is incredible, the crunch choux was delicious. This is one of my favorite morning cafe visits  in Vegas. The service is great and helpful."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a late breakfast or lunch in the Grand Canal Shops. They offer great looking sandwiches and a terrific selection of pastries! I tried the Hawaiian Sausage Bread which is so delicious and the Pain Au Chocolat which is also good. I also tried a Lavender Macaron that was ok. The fresh orange juice was great and comes in an adorable glass bottle. The service was nice and quick and I really enjoyed the upstairs place to eat with a view of the Grand Canal Shops & street performers below. Thanks for the tip Samantha D. I read her review of this place before visiting and it was very insightful. Love this spot and will come again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was HARD to find. I saw those little billboards for the place, but didn't say where to go. I was going all over the place except were it was. I finally found it, but they were getting ready to close. NO!

I wanted an iced coffee and he said it was pre-made and I was fine with that. I ended up also getting a Cappuccino Royal Pudding.

I actually liked the coffee a lot. It was like nutty with a hint of mocha. Very good! The Royal Pudding was good, but a bit hard to eat.

Will definitely go back if I was in the area. Wished I came here before the other places for coffee!"}
{"text":"Staying at the Palazzo for an overcrowded event, went to Paris Baguette as it was a place with smaller lines and food to go. The poke bowls are ok, but absolutely not true poke. But they're cheap and will fill you up. Also tried a sandwich another day, which was just Ok. Service is a disaster."}
{"text":"Had my first breakfast at Vegas here. I was told by my buddy that it's got quality bakery and sweets. Being a fan of both mentioned things I told myself I must try this. I was not disappointed at all! They got a self-serve style for their bakeries similar to Chinese bakery restaurants where you grab a platter and serve yourself with clamps. I tried their chocolate croissant as well as their ham & cheese croissant. I loved both of them. The ham and & cheese blended very well and with the croissant I felt like I was eating a delicious buttery grilled cheese with ham. 

I have also had their vanilla pudding. It came in a cute little bottle. It was sweet and creamy but in my opinion it was a little too soft. The texture was closer to yogurt then it was to pudding. The taste was great nonetheless.

Lastly, I have tried their iced house coffee. Great coffee taste but super sweet. I like it, but I would not recommend it to people that dislikes sweet iced coffee like the ones from McDonalds."}
{"text":"Love Paris Baguette in every other city I've had it, service is always the best but this location is probably the least maintained and the day shift crew had a lot of attitude and didn't want to help compared to the night shift crew(I usually go at night) Went today at around 2:30pm and they weren't busy but still walked away as I was clearly asking a question, the entire staff seemed like they didn't want to be working."}
{"text":"The first breakfast place we went to in Las Vegas which is located in the Venetian.  It was probably one of the cheaper places for sure, which is a big bonus since most places in the resorts are above $10 for breakfast while this place you can probably spend less than that and still have a decent meal.

I found my breakfast sandwich decent, it came with scrambled eggs, ham, brie and cheddar cheese. Nothing special or outstanding. It was nice how they gave you a tray and you can then select which items you want by grabbing them you want as the line moves along the counter. They'll also toast sandwiches or other food that you'd want toasted."}
{"text":"New addition to the main Chinatown plaza. They have their original Vegas location on the Strip and opened one in this location. Decent selection of bread, cakes, macarons, and other pastries. There is complimentary water available, and the pastries are self-served. There are also a few tables for seating inside. 

The location is in the northeast corner of the plaza, and there's plenty of parking available in front."}
{"text":"There presentation is wonderful. I got lured in with a free sample of a almond pastry and it was very delicious. Very light in taste and not a overpowering almond flavor which caused me to go and buy me 2. They offer coffee and other pastries but honestly the coffee didn't look good but I'm not a coffee drinker so I guess my opinion probably doesn't matter much. Overall I love it."}
{"text":"Awwwww man, this place was awesome.  We tried a number of savory and sweet pastries and they were all great.  The almond croissant had a nice crunch and buttery flakiness that was off the chains.  For a great view, make sure you grab a seat upstairs overlooking the market square.  

Great selection of pastries and decent prices for Vegas.  Will definitely stop back here the next time I'm staying at the Palazzo or Venetian."}
{"text":"Paris Baguettes are common in NYC, but for some odd reasons (or maybe it's just my personal bias), I did not expect to see one in Las Vegas. I was surprised to find it at the Venetian casino (why is it not in the Paris casino?). I even doubted that it was the same Paris Baguette chain so much that I just had to go to confirm for myself. I entered the store in disbelief, but it all changed when I spotted the red bean bread. Okay, that totally screamed Paris Baguette.

The bread selection was much smaller than the stores in NY, but they had some pizza-esque ciabatta that I had never seen in a NY store before. They also had a salad station as well.

I had a hard time deciding what to have, I ended up getting a crab croquette, which was only 2.75, a price you do not commonly see on the Strip. I was very content with how economical my lunch would be until I ordered a coffee to pair with the croquette. A small cup of hot coffee was $3, more than the croquette!

While I understand it's a store inside the Venetian so the rent must be through the roof, but it just doesn't make sense to charge more for a regular cup of coffee that requires no barista skills to prepare, should cost more than the food itself..Had they reversed the prices, say, 3 bucks for the croquette and 2.75 for the coffee, that would feel much more rational.

In any case, I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the pricey coffee.

Pros: economical snack/lunch if you skip coffee and it's by that square where the have performances so you can be entertained while you eat.

Cons: coffee is pricey"}
{"text":"This place has been truly delicious and we recommend it to other coworkers but man are they ALWAYS running out of product for their Poké bowls.  I started this review months ago when we stopped in for lunch and they were out of so much Poké bowl product.  It was so bad that I took photos of their empty containers but deleted them when I decided to not pursue with the review. Their excuse was \"we were busy earlier\". 

Many visits later, they're still running out of product! It's a good day when we come in and everything is available. We keep returning because honestly the bowls are amazing!  We've got so many coworkers hooked on them and it's a nice change to our cafeteria food we eat 5 days a week and want to treat ourselves but just wish their product was fully available.  

Also the service is very slow but I believe they're low on employees because I've seen the \"We're Hiring\" signs quite often."}
{"text":"I've been to several different Paris Baguettes in California, and they were much larger and offered a more variety of pastries compared to this location. This bakery is located in a large plaza in China Town right next to 99 Ranch, so you won't have an issue with parking. Because I love red bean everything, I decided to try their red bean bun. My friends tried their ham and cheese croissant, sweet potato pastry, and hot dog bun. The pastries all tasted good, but not amazing. I think I would come here again if I was craving some asian baked goods."}
{"text":"I'm excited that Paris Baguette is finally branching out to other locations in LV. My boyfriend and I always stop by their Cali locations and loved their pastries and coffee. Located on Spring Mountain, this is the second one that recently opened with the first Paris Baguette situated on the strip. Best part about this location is that there's free parking and it is easy to get to rather than trying to go to the one on the strip. 

Upon entering the bakery, we were greeted by friendly staff. They were very helpful in answering any questions we had. We were a little disappointed to find that this one is a much smaller bakery with very few baked goods of pastries and breads to choose from compared to other ones we've been to in Cali. They also make hot sandwiches and drinks (including smoothies, tea, and coffee). We decided to pick a few pastries to go including sweet potato bread, mango pastry, and two sausage croissants. Everything was delicious. We haven't had one bad baked good. Hopefully the next time we come back, there will be a much larger selection of baked goods to choose from."}
{"text":"This place was great!! Staff was nice and provide you samples. We had macaroons, a strawberry cheese pastry and a tiramisu pastry. The tiramisu pastry was amazing!!! The best I've had in a long time! The macaroons had great taste and a lot of variety. All the prices were very fair as well for the level of taste. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"What a cute little gem. We ordered 3 macarons (rose, earl grey and pistachio) and a green tea chiffon cake. There is actually a dining area on the second floor of the bakery (Yelp tip) so we headed upstairs and enjoyed our view of St Mark's Square from above.

I was very impressed with the macarons. They had the perfect combination of flavor and sweetness. Most macarons I've tried (including Pierre Herme and Ladurée) and those that friends have baked are way too sweet! Same with cakes. The chiffon cake was light and airy and a very good size to split among 2+ people. 

I'd also like to point out that their staff is so patient and polite. There were 2 customers before me and were both demanding and rude. However, the cashier was patient and polite and carried out the customers' requests including repackaging the desserts to individual boxes and bags, and providing cake cutter and candles (when only a single slice of cake was purchased) after payment."}
{"text":"As any nosey K-drama fan would, I had to add Paris Baguette to my list of musts, since their logo/name pops up prominently on so many sponsored end credits. And with over 1800+ locations, probably one on every other block in Seoul, this is Nevada's first PB, located inside Venetian's Grand Canal Shoppes. 

The mini chocolate croissant (Cocossant) was nice & flaky and only $1.50. I was tempted by a raspberry cronut but I had other dessert stops on my itinerary and had to decline.

To be expected their regular sized pastries & desserts are on the pricey side and they do have a few take home/souvenir treats attractively packed for purchase.

They also had similar pastries that can be found at home (macarons, sausage bread, mushipan, cream cakes, etc).

If I was staying at the Venetian, or somewhere close by, I would've returned to try their quick bites (sandwiches, ice cream popsicles, iced coffee, etc) & stopped in upstairs for a relaxing break to people watch from above."}
{"text":"Expensive.

It could just be the Vegas \"tax\" but everything I saw here was more expensive than the Paris Baguette I have near my house. The flavors were alright though. Definitely less sweet than the one in San Diego but kind of on par with the one in Arcadia."}
{"text":"Paris Baguette has become our go to bakery!! My wife and I go to items are very simple

Twisted custard crumb donuts
Cronut (custard filled so good!)
Chocolate croissant 
All the hot dog buns ( there's 2 kinds I like the one that has a swirl of ketchup and mustard on top) 
Chocolate Chiffon cake slice is also bomb

I'll be back for some more goodies on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Not impressed, the ice cream sandwich size is misleading. It looks big from the outside packaging but only the cup makes it look bigger, also lacks flavor. Got $20 worth of bland pastries. Worst part was the cashier let someone cut in front of a huge line and didn't even do anything about it."}
{"text":"Really disappointing service. We went in for a quick bite. The place is called Paris Baguette, but when we ordered a sandwich the employee said they were out of baguettes. They offered a dressing for the sandwich and then said they were out. 

We sat down to eat and five minutes after us, four people got sandwiches on baguettes. Employee was really rude and not helpful."}
{"text":"After getting some ancient Chinese Medicine from a the shop next door, my friend wanted to come here to pick up some goodies for his family.  

The location was clean, excellent lighting to see the goods, the area was tight and packed, seating was limited, the staff was friendly and kind.  I couldn't find the loo.  Not that I needed to do a two or anything, but just in case you know.  

They had a huge selection of food here, from drinks to sweets to savoury goods!  Absolutely stunning!  All looked super delicious.  I'm sure there is something for everyone here!  They gave free water too!  Good ole free Vegas water.  Overall a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I wanted to try out this place because I saw that they had croissant donuts.  When I came, they only had two left of the lemon creme croissant donuts, and I bought one for about $5 and a Curry Croquette for about $3.  They had a lot of yummy-looking pastries, but I figured I might stop by another day.  The pastries that I bought were good, but I did think that the croissant donut would be much better."}
{"text":"I AM SO HAPPY THIS PLACE OPENED!!! 

This is seriously the cutest little pastry shop that opened up in the Ranch 99 plaza right next door to the Chinese medicine shop (has all the roots/teas in that store). So I love croissants, and they have a great variety of different kinds. Some are stuffed with ham and cheese or a delicious sausage while others are dipped in chocolate or covered in some kind of yummy glaze topped with nuts. This place also carries the Japanese fluffy cheesecake!! I LOVE the crab stuffed potato croquet! It has such a generous amount of crab meat in it, sooo good. 2nd favorite has to be the croissant that has the sausage inside of it. It I love that there's breadcrumbs on top to give the croissant a little crunch in every bite and they drizzle ketchup and mustard on top! I actually like that idea since the croissant is so flakey you only need a little bit of sauce and that tang from the mustard can go along way. The sausage inside has a tiny kick but it's really savory and a little sweet. There's also this croissant like dessert that has strawberries and cream inside, it's wrapped in a spiral but it's flakey just like a croissant topped with more strawberries. Just enough sweetness and cream to satisfy your tastebuds, literally. The cream tastes fresh and it's def not oily unlike other places. I had other things too but those were my favorite so far. But honestly, everything was DELICIOUS. This place deserves some great recommendations when you want yummy little pastries.I deff want to go back and buy one of their fresh fruit cakes there. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is  my favorite place in Las Vegas for poke bowls. The fish is fresh, all the veggies are seasoned perfect! I get the regular because I can never finish the large. Service is always great and the price is good. They always offer free crab salad! I could eat this everyday."}
{"text":"The \"Asian Invasion\" continues on Spring Mountain Rd. This popular bakery chain is the 2nd location in Las Vegas located at the Chinatown Plaza. Paris Baguette is based in South Korea with thousands of locations worldwide with a significant amount of locations in California. Initially many will confuse this establishment with an actual French Patisserie but it's more of a French inspired bakery with Asian influences. 

I personally like the items they offer. From the delicious Cheese Soufflé Cake and Soft Cheese and Strawberry Cake to the different flavor croissants and savory items. The staff is very friendly despite how busy they have been since they've opened on 12/23/18. Another cool aspect of their pastries is the various sizes allowing you to try more at a reasonable price point. They have a case full of custom cakes ready for purchase and usually decorated according to seasons. I will definitely be back for more, especially since it's located off the strip!

2017 Yelp Review #71"}
{"text":"Paris Baguette is a pretty huge chain, originating from Korea. They have dozens of bakeries in Seoul and they have a good amount in California as well. Their first location in Las Vegas was in Venetian and this is their second location in Vegas. 

I'm glad that they decided to open a second location! I honestly don't want to go to Venetian just for some bread. 

Their stores in Korea are bigger and have more variety. Its a little disappointing that the stores here don't have as much variety but they do have a decent amount. They have pastry items like croissants, mini garlic croissants, chocolate croissants, a large variety of donuts, bread with sausages, egg tarts, cronuts, and various other bread items. 

They have drinks, sandwiches, and cakes! There are some sandwiches where you can get them toasted as well. They have like three different popsicles, one type of ice cream sandwiches, and different fruity tarts. They have castella cakes too!

I really like their egg tarts. I like to heat it up in my toaster and have it as a snack! 

I also really like their selection of cakes. I've had the blueberry chiffon cake and their blueberry yogurt cake. Both were really delicious. They have whole cakes you can buy as well. But if you want to order one for a birthday or something, you will have to order at least three days ahead. When you order it, they an write a message on there for you. 

Nice place to try out and get some snacks. Great for breakfast too!"}
{"text":"If you go 2 hours before closing- you're probably going to see a lot of breads and pastries missing from the stands. 

The cronuts are amazing! It's expensive in my opinion, but it's really good! ($3.50) 
I've been Paris Baguette in the Philippines and California, but never had the cronuts.

The customer service is fine, no one really welcomed us in, but I didn't really care.

{"text":"Went here several times while in Vegas for coffee and breakfast. Great hot sandwiches and coffee at a reasonable price. Check in on yelp for a free coffee!"}
{"text":"YAY!  A proper croissant.  May I have two please? And a chocolate croissant as well... and oohh yeah, I need... (need?)  yeah need one of those eclairs, and bretons. Shoot, no fridge in my room I guess I will have to start with the eclairs when I get back. 

I came here twice in an hour.  Once to get a sandwich and with some latte, and then after wandering the Venetian straight back to get the rest of the pastries listed above.  As much as I loved getting my steps in while in Vegas, I was on day 4 and my legs were killing me.  No way I was going to be here the next day from the Bellagio.  My only regret is that the Bellagio didn't have a similar location I would have been there every day.  It was a nice respite since I miss Paris so much.  Hoping to get some decents croissants and baguettes next time I'm at the real thing."}
{"text":"Paris baguette inside the Venetian.. This was bound to happen!! I was so happy they had cronuts here! I just wish it didn't cost an arm and a leg for it but it's Vegas, what're you gonna do.. NOT get a cronut?! Psh."}
{"text":"I've been to other Paris Baguette locations and love it. This one was a bit of a let down. 

Limited choices - looks like they slimed down what they used to offer a few months before. They also ran out of food for my coworker who was looking for vegetarian options. 

Customer service - disappointing. There was one one gentleman who was nice, but most didn't care if you were there. 

Only good thing I got was the cronut and macaroons."}
{"text":"Very wide selection of pastries which can be overwhelming. I did like the items I choose but i had to knock two stars due to the service and inconsistency in quality of the pastries. Been here three times already and it was hit or miss. The staff is not too friendly and they don't really acknowledge any of the customers or offer help. The cashier also was kinda rude when telling us we had to re-insert our card payment. 

I wouldn't visit at night because it seems like most of the items have been sitting out for the day which resulted in kinda dry or oily products like the donuts and chocolate croissant which I did try. And they didn't really have anything in the cases even though it was about 6 hours til closing. 

I got the soft cheesecake which was in the cold case and decided I wanted to sit and eat it here. When I went to cut into it it was still frozen and I couldn't take a bite. I wish the staff at least warned me about that. Once I let it sit out for a bit at home it was delicious but I was still disappointed that I had to wait for it to defrost.

The cheese danish is probably one of the best I've had and would most likely come back for that whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This bakery is delicious! Best place to get a bday cake in place. Price is good too. They have 2 location in Vegas. Paris casino and Chinatown on Spring Mountain.  If you love dessert.  This is a place you must it out."}
{"text":"Love this place! We go every time we are in Las Vegas...multiple times!  Amazing pastries and some of the nicest servers in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Mocha frappe is awesome!  And the happiest thing is it's half price! Love the snacks and dessert here. Beautifully served and made"}
{"text":"I had a \"toasted\" caprese sandwich that was already prepared and sitting in the case. The center of it was ice cold after \"toasting\". Nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"Pros: The food and coffee were both delicious.
Cons: Very hard to find. It is in the Venetian but some staff we asked had no idea where it was. If you're looking for it try asking for directions to St Marks Square. The biggest con for me, though, was the atmosphere. The appearance was good, but while we were here trying to relax they had Work by Rihanna blaring out of their speakers which seemed oddly jarring and out of place with the rest of their theme."}
{"text":"Ok,
I liked this place. It's small, neat and to the point for typical french bagutte and pastries. The pastrami baguette that I ordered was great and the express was good. Here are my not so great comments: 1. The girl behind the counter was rude. I took the coffee and was waiting outside for my baguette but after a while I figured they had forgotten, so I went back inside. She was so rude and asked me if I really ordered a pastrami and who was the person that rung me up. I told her it was her. She denied it and very rudely said: just go sit down will get it to you. Even dogs aren't told to \"just sit down\" especially for a mistake they made.
2. Their espresso is offered in a paper cup like the ones we use in bathrooms for mouth wash. I asked her to pour my espresso in a real porcelain cup and she said they don't have any. I'm sorry but if I'm sitting to drink my coffee k would like a real cup so I don't feel like I'm drinking my coffee in the bathroom.

Customer service sucks but the food was good ."}
{"text":"Great clean European style coffee shop & bakery in Las Vegas inside the Venetian hotel. You can pick your desired Pastery and enjoy a delicious taste.
Been here few times and it's always clean and staff are quick and polite. 
This place is open early in the morning if you like to have fresh good coffee and some privacy away from hotel traffic."}
{"text":"Worse customer service ever!!! I bought 3 plain croissants yesterday. One for me and 2 for my other co-workers... my croissant was fine, but my coworker said there was a funny taste to hers so she choose not to eat it. I brought it back this morning to show them and to see if they could give her a new one so that maybe she can enjoy one. 
The lady that worked at the front said she needed to talk to the baker and show him. 
She then comes back in 5 minutes and said there was nothing they could do since it was yesterday, I told her we were at work and couldn't leave work just to take back a croissant. She still insisted \"Sorry, this was meant to be eaten fresh and during the day\". I was like \"it had a funny taste, she didn't want to eat it and get sick\". 

I really can't believe they couldn't replace a $1.85 croissant? It wasn't like I was asking for cash back or asking to replace a dozen Just another replacement croissant. SMH. There's no personal touch or any type of customer service! I thought for a quick minute to just buy another one for my coworker but fuck that! 
Why would I give them another $1.85 (plus tax)??? I will never step foot in there again and I'm telling all my friends and family about their horrible service or in this case, lack of service!!!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this spot when I noticed all the people crowding the oitside. Curiously led me in and I found a self serve bakery consisting of croissant-like breakfast treats. 

I'm coming in after a full meal from elsewhere but I had to make the most of my time and try something. I went with a \"Mango Heaven,\" a business card sized, flaky, and sweet breakfast dessert ($1.75) and Chocolate Macaroon ($2.50). 

Both were good, but I was not impressed. The crowd outside led me to believe this place was spectacular, but it was just mediocre. However, knowing me, I'll probably come back and try something different - there's a bunch of stuff. Also, they have WiFi so coming back hebe a nice change from the typical Starbucks."}
{"text":"Surprisingly small location when compared to the ones I have been to in Atlanta and Boston. The selection also seemed to be more limited, which left me a bit underwhelmed. I don't know why they didn't choose a bigger spot."}
{"text":"Great place to have a cup of coffee and rest after a long day of walking. Got a variety of pastries and drinks. Got a good view of the over all plaza on the second floor."}
{"text":"We wanted a quick and easy breakfast. The tuna salad and egg salad were amazing. Macaroons were delicious.

I love the presentation of the food, everything looked so pretty.

Update: A group of 5 of us came back here since there was such a long wait, an hour plus (normal for being New Years), at the restaurants in the Venetian. We ordered the same items, tuna salad, egg salad, bruschetta, fresh squeezed orange juice. It was as amazing as the first time we had it."}
{"text":"Wow! I cannot even say how Great this place is! the food and staff are awesome! i will be going back today! I had the Pastrami sandwich and it was great! cannot wait to have more!"}
{"text":"Mon Amie, Mon Amour, Mon Paris Baguette.

Founded in 1988 and with over 3,000 locations is the beloved Paris Baguette.

Gotta love a good Korean-French pastry!  I got a Blueberry Cream Cheese Pastry and it was pretty good.  The cream cheese and blueberry filling was delicious but the bread part itself lacked any flavor.  My friend picked up quite a few goods to bring back to his parents and they seemingly loved it.

There are so many cakes, breads, pastries, macarons, specialty drinks, sandwiches, salads, and even ice pops in store.  There's also a water dispenser with fruit for you to get some water if you're thirsty.  I can see why this place is so widely loved.  Seating was decent, the store was bright and clean, and they have a modest amount of selection.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"i like this place, the desserts, pastries and drinks are not too overwhelming!! :)"}
{"text":"So kind of on the fence about this place. Curry croquette bun? was okay. The almond pastry was like an almond croissant but lacked flavor. The almond croissant looked unappetizing with its swirl of I don't know what on top. 

The desserts were very pricey. More than what some top bakeries charge. 

The croissants lacked their buttery flakey texture and flavor. They seemed a bit dry."}
{"text":"We had this a few times either as a quick breakfast or lunch. Both times were amazing. Chocolate croissant is to die for. I also had the salmon sandwich. It was amazing. This will definitely be my quick bite place when I'm near Paris!"}
{"text":"Visited Paris Baguette on a Friday afternoon, located inside the Venetian in St Marks Square.  

Being a bakery I was recommended to come later on in the afternoon as they would be really busy in the morning.

Walked in and was immediately greeted by the staff, everyone was really friendly and helpful.  They have self serve breads, and oh my god do they have a lot of different selections and different samples to try! 

The bakers behind the clear case were super friendly as well and recommended (i don't remember the names hehe) 
the hash brown one (with a cold but tasty hash brown wrapped in a bread)
the chocolate baguette 
and a little one that looked like a hot dog (also cold by the time I got to it)
also went for the pineapple bread (with real pieces of pineapple inside.)

After my friend and I finished all the pastries we went back to try two more things, their royal pudding and the peach tea.  As far as the peach tea goes, nothing too special very peachy not too sweet not too much tea flavor, and I guess they only have one size (small???) weird. The pudding was in a super cute glass bottle with a plastic lid, I got the strawberry one!

The price for the three pastries, peach tea, and pudding all totaled up to about $25


 I will definitely be back for more!"}
