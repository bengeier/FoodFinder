{"text":"Wonderful service in both English and French and a very long list of options. Got a Californian inspired egg omelette with salsa, sour cream, sliced avacado, peppers and onions with a side of sliced and spiced potatoes and some fruit wedges. As a drink I got a banana chocolate expresso yogurt drink that woke me up good. All together about 21$ before tip."}
{"text":"So good. Awesome breakfast, great laid back atmosphere, friendly service, reasonable prices. Would undoubtedly return for more."}
{"text":"Eggs were good. Generously portioned. The service was good. Would definitely recommend for breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"This is the second time back and I loved it again! Me and my friends went as a group (7 of us) and of course forgot to make a reservation, but we didn't have to wait long for a spot! I think it was only around 10 minutes, so not long at all. The servers are awesome and I was  kind of embbarrassed by the end because 1: There was originally supposed to be 8 of us, but 1 of my friends had changed her mind last minute, and 2: my friends spilled water all over the floor. Anyway, great service, very friendly! I got the All american, and it was so good! I am in love with the Lyonnasie style potatoes, so good. and so was everything else! Definetly returning sometime in the new year !"}
{"text":"Worst Experience. Today I came in and I was seated rather promptly. I ordered the California Dreaming and a Page (smoothie). During my entire meal, Bennett, the waiter, never checked up with me to see if everything was ok. I also asked for a water as part of my order and he forgot it. So I had to ask someone else for it. But to top it off, when I was finished my meal, I had to wait an extra 10 minutes because the waiter was chatting with two female customers for a long time. I tried getting his attention but to no avail. After he finally notices that I was starring at him for 10 minutes, he finally comes to my table. My sister is a waitress so I understand how tough the job is, and I usually tip more than 15% because I know being a waiter/waitress is a demanding job. But in this case, I had no problem giving Bennett a 0% tip. If you don't care about your job...I won't!  I will NEVER goto this restaurant again"}
{"text":"Outdoor patio, right behind Eaton Centre. Omelette with Avocado and Sour Cream and very pleasant service. Cannot go wrong with this place :)"}
{"text":"Food:  3.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Cleanliness: 3.5/5
Price: 3.5/5

On the several occasions I've been at Eggspectation, I haven't been able to try a variety of their breakfast foods for this reason: their Southwest omelette has been so good that I order it every time I visit!

With fresh ripe avocado and salsa on top of my well cooked omelette, I am eager for my next bite even before I finished the one in my mouth. The hash potatoes that accompany the omelette are very addicting, and I end up finishing all of them even though I'm very full from my omelette.

My husband usually goes for their benedicts, and the smoked salmon is one of his favourites. Served on whole wheat toast, it's definitely going to fill you up for the rest of your day. We find that the portions are quite huge and sort of difficult to finish; we end up almost always leaving the fruit untouched, or barely touched that is because we are so full.

The rest of the drinks are alright - they always have condiments and other things always fully stocked and they are quick to get you anything that you need if not present. The coffee and tea that we always order in the morning are average but will give you the kick of caffeine that you need in the morning. As for the service, we've had good and average service when we've been; Eggspectation has always been really full of customers and so very busy! They really need to hire more servers during the busy morning hours...

Anyway, if you're new in town, Eggspectation should be tried at least once! It's a great place to start your day whether you're here for business or for leisure, or even if you live in the city! The restaurant is located all around eastern Canada and USA, so find your closest location on their website and try the Southwest omelette!"}
{"text":"We came here for Mother's Day around 11 am, and surprisingly the place was not packed at all and didn't become packed after 1-2 hours either.

Maybe it's because we didn't order anything that different from usual breakfast items at other restaurants, but our orders were good!, just nothing special. Things that you can make at home with minimal effort or cooking skill- kind of just there for the environment and special occasion. They were overpriced of course, but that's nothing new and came as no surprise.

The food was satisfying, and may be returning if it ends up being worth it :)"}
{"text":"At first glance the menu is just way too long.
Every variety of egg based dish under the sun is on the menu.
Almost everyone can find some combination or the other that works from the huge choice.
We were pleasantly surprised by the food. Maybe it was because we walked in thinking of it as just another breakfast place.
Service is quick as you would expect at a breakfast joint."}
{"text":"As my first time here in Toronto, Ontario I was unsure of what to expect with restaurants and food quality.  I found this restaurant on Yelp & I decided to try. I had the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict with an egg sunny side up instead of poached, it was amazing.  My friends ordered the Belgian Waffle & Eggstravaganza which they raved about as well.  The service was great, the waitress was very accomodating and the wait was not long for our food. We give this place 5 star."}
{"text":"Volle 5 Sterne für das Eggspectation! Jedesmal wenn ich Toronto bin, freue ich mich schon auf ein ausgiebiges Frühstück bei Eggspectations!


 Schon den Namen finde ich klasse - denn hier kann man wirklich viele tolle Sachen erwarten!


 Das Café und Bistro befindet sich in der Innenstadt von Toronto, direkt im Eaton Centre. Wie man schon vermuten kann, sind Eierspeisen ein Hauptbestandteil des Cafés.


 Es gibt unzählige Varianten von Omeletts, Spiegeleier, Sandwiches, Burgern, Pancakes und speziellen Eierzubereitungen wie z.B. Eggs Benedict - die ich NUR EMPFEHLEN kann! Die Karte ist wirklich sehr sehr umfangreich und besteht akute qual der Wahl.


 Also: vergesst das Frühstücksbuffet in eurem Hotel - ab zu Eggspectations!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Casual place, open, personable and fast service. Breakfast was delicious! The French toast with maple syrup was fabulous. Scrambled eggs were cook perfectly. Bacon was cooked well too. Freshly squeezed orange juice was delicious. I recommend having breakfast here, and I will go back there again!"}
{"text":"Always always visit eggspectation when we are in Montreal.  Was here last weekend and the food is amazing and a good price.  This time around we had a large group and they had a hard time figuring it seating which was a little disappointing.  Either way, we've always had a great experience here.  The only thing to make it better would be if they accepted reservations or call ahead."}
{"text":"So we were looking for somewhere to get an all-out, nothing too fancy breakfast whilst in Montreal, and Yelp led us here!
It was pretty busy, but we were seated quickly (we were there about 11.30am). The restaurant was kind of small and actually part of a Hotel which we didn't know about. They had an upstairs mezzanine seating area as well which was nice. Our waiter was really polite and helpful. After we ordered some coffee and OJ (freshly squeezed and delicious), we noticed that their was a football game on we wanted to watch, so we asked him if we could eat at the bar - not a problem! Bartender was super nice and talkative. We had a good chat about the football and places to see in Montreal. Next came breakfast! My boyfriend had the Belgium waffles with strawberries for around $11 which were huge! They were covered in fresh strawberries with a generous helping of maple syrup. I went for the American breakfast with Scrambled eggs and Whole grain toast. The home-fries were good, with onions as well. Bacon crisp, sausage sweet, no complaints for $8! The only disappointing factor was the coffee, I had a few cups because I needed some fuel, but it really wasn't the nicest. But hey, the food ticked every box for what we wanted so we were very happy!"}
{"text":"I am outraged and offended. It was a beautiful sunny day warm enough to eat outside. We went to Eggspe cations to eat outside and enjoy the warm day for lunch. There were several Empty Tables along the sidewalk. We went to the hostess, myself, my wife and my very mature 11 year old son and ask to be seated outside. The hostess told us that the outdoor tables were for the bar only and sat us indoors.  We watched Group after group of people in their twenties and thirties walk by and be seated Outdoors and order food and get served. Some had drinks and some did not. It was then I realized that we were discriminated against either because we had an 11 year old with us or for other reasons even more pernicious. In either event we were greatly offended and left. A restaurant that does not respect everyone respects no one. Don't go there.  PS- They seated us indoors next to the bar"}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat , has a variety of options , the service is awesome , i seriously love this place its one of my favorites !! Its nice and cozy and during summer you have the option to eat outside or inside"}
{"text":"First breakfast in Montreal. The Eggs Benedict are a must. The red Sangria is amazing! I would definitely come back for seconds!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast outdoors on a nice breezy summer morning.  The breakfast was fine; we had their eggshilaration dish, which were eggs cooked together with grilled chicken.  The chicken was overcooked, but their sliced potatoes was quite good and refreshing.  This was the few places in the area in which we were also able to find fresh squeezed orange juice, which my wife was craving."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible, even with a hangover. 

I wouldn't have eaten here unless I was desperate for eggs...and that's exactly what happened.  It's a tourist trap restaurant in a busy location with no reason to bring local patrons back.  

Small eggs, overly onioned potatoes, mushy, cheap sausages, the service was rushed... All sorts of things to keep this place off my breakfast/brunch list.

I'm quite certain I will never ever return."}
{"text":"Really good. Better than anything we have in the Boston area.  Nice folks run the place. Service was fast.  I must have been to a different place than many of these other negative reviews.  I am going back."}
{"text":"Really satisfying place to go for breakfast if you're in downtown Montreal. Extensive breakfast menu all day long and as well lunch/dinner items like burgers, sandwiches, pasta, chicken dishes. Delicious selection of fruit juices, but pass on the \"guacamole\"."}
{"text":"I would return to Montreal just to eat at this restaurant. The food and service are excellent. We had breakfast here the second day of our trip and each day thereafter because it was that good. Whether it was the lobster benedict, lobster omelet, American breakfast, steak and eggs, high rise pancakes, s'mores French toast, coffee, cappuccino, cafe au lait, espresso...everything we ordered was delicious and brought quickly and with a smile. 

While all our servers were quick, courteous and efficient, Xuan was a standout with his outgoing personality. Another server could see that we were tourists and offered us walking maps of Old Montreal. 

There is more than one location in Montreal; I can only hope one day one will open in New York City."}
{"text":"I really loved this place. Wonderful sidewalk atmosphere.  Attentive archive .  My omelet was really good and the potatoes lyonnaise were memorable.  And they had fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. I would have gone 5 stars but my wife wasn't thrilled with hers."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that the food is reasonably good here. It's a hit or miss. I'd give this place 3 stars if it weren't for the terrible service and attitude we received. We visited on December 27 and boy, was it busy. This was our second visit, so were prepared for a bit of a wait. The woman manning the seating/reception area was completely unorganized and frazzled. She kept asking the waiting lineup who had come before who. It's her job to keep track! This place really needs a ticketed waiting system. We came in with a few other people and she looked at us and completely ignored us. No acknowledgement whatsoever. A couple that had been waiting for some time, and were forgotten about, approached her and she straight out gave them attitude saying \"you'll have to wait, I'm only one person\". We finally managed to speak with her and she took our name and told us to wait where we were waiting and she would call us when a table became available. We stood in the exact same spot for 15 minutes. For some odd reason, she decided to walk all the way to the opposite side of the room and call our name out. The place is extremely noisy, so there is no way we would have heard her. One of the other people in line mentioned that she had called us, so we took a look at her list (she left it behind at the desk) and lo and behold, she had crossed us off the list! I mentioned it to her and she yelled at me! 'WHY DIDN'T YOU COME WHEN I CALLED YOU\"?? And then she proceeded to bicker with me. We were finally seated and I turned to her and thanked her for seating us.  She gave me attitude again, telling me: \"don't curse me and then pat me on the back\". Well, as far as the food goes, it was pretty good on both occasions. I've had the breakfast sandwich and the El Torro burger, both delicious. My other half had the pancakes and I'm told they were far too sweet on their own. Our server was very polite and accommodating."}
{"text":"I ordered a strawberry and banana french toast. Too sweet both the sauce and the fruits. And I asked for the sauce to be on the side still couldn't finish it. 

The guy who served me was bleh, maybe cause I looked a bit like I had no money (lol) so he didn't care much serving me. He left me hanging for 10 mins to pay for my bill. I even had to ask another server in able to pay. 

Anyway, won't be back to this location again."}
{"text":"Perhaps we had unrealistic expectations for this place, having gone to L'Avenue the day before, but boy was it bad. Service beyond slow, despite the place being only half full, latte so bad as to be un drinkable . I actually sent it back, twice and told them to forget it. Pancakes were meh, poached eggs rubbery, need I say more? When we got the check, they made a big deal of saying they didn't charge me for the latte I couldn't drink!!! Should hope not....won't be back."}
{"text":"Eating here was okay but I'm not sure if I'd go back. We sat on the patio and were seated first next to an exhaust vent for the building that was loud and blew hot air. We were accommodated by the server when asked to move away from the vent to an open table. Most unfortunately, there was a table of other patrons chain smoking next to us which diminished the good aspects of the experience. Ordering was relatively easy though the server was forgetful about the order. The food came quickly, which was great. The food was pretty good though the Montreal smoked meat was excessively salty without much other flavor."}
{"text":"Was looking for a nice terrace to eat lunch downtown. The terrace was full of customers and the menu looked promising. The omelet i have ordered was a huge disappointment as the egg white was half uncooked so it was very liquid and gross. The lyonnaise potato that came as a side to this dish was nicely advertised on the menu but it tasted like the fridge with a unfrozen texture. There were three pieces of fruit - the pineapple was white like the plate and lacked juice. We didn't complain or said anything to the waiter. The waiter was very unfriendly. He walked away after receiving our payment without saying anything. Not to mention that the tip option on the paying machine was set to 18% and over. We're not thinking of returning to this place again"}
{"text":"I had the lobster omelette featuring a quarter-pound of gently sautéed Nova Scotia lobster, provolone cheese, green onions, topped with our famous hollandaise sauce
and broiled to finish. Judging this book by its cover, when placed in front of me, I gave it the 'ol stink-eye for I thought I was being duped by the claim of a full quarter-pound of lobster.

I crossed my arms and gave my plate Sheldon look of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.

Until I cracked the sucker opened and lobster came tumbling out like Monica Geller's junk closet. The hollandaise sauce gave the omelette a definite richness that complimented the lobster, whose brininess brought out and was cut by the lemon in the sauce."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere!  Ate outside right on the sidewalk in a nice wooden enclosed area with umbrellas.

Had a great brunch in the middle of the week with fresh fruit juices, good coffee, and excellent breakfast food.

Would certainly return again, highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you want diner food and lots of it, go here. Unlike other diners this place is easy on the salt and the cooks are fast. The espresso is very good and the selection is large. The price is very reasonable. If the weather is good, get on the patio."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. We all ordered burgers. The service was quick enough and our burgers were pretty good.

One downside was that a member of our party ordered a fried egg to put on his burger, and the waitress (or kitchen) completely forgot about it. She brought it out after he was done eating, which defeated the purpose."}
{"text":"Lots of choices.  I never spent so much time to make my pick.  Lovely ambience and friendly service. It's a little hard to find though. It is tucked away by Albert street facing the court house."}
{"text":"Its not that this place is bad, it just seems to me that every plate on the menu is a little bland.. And considering the prices are a little on the high side for a chain restaurant, i would expect a little more flavor.. But it remains an ok brunch place in a pinch"}
{"text":"Classic brunch spot with a touch of class. Had the eggs florentine that was served with potatoes and fruits. The hollandaise sauce was creamy and tasty, which went perfectly well with the eggs and English muffin. Overall atmosphere of the place was lively and energetic with different groups of people including families enjoying their brunch together. The waitresses were very friendly and attentive, always checking on you to see if you needed anything. Definitely a brunch spot that I'll go again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Highly commendable service. However, the noise level is so high in the restaurant that we could not carry on a conversation at Sunday brunch - it compromised the experience."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.  Excellent food, decent prices, lively atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff.  Can be a wait during peak times.  French Toast is excellent."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews.

Some of my friends absolutely loved their meals.  They felt that it was some of the best scrambled eggs they ever had.  Me, either I ordered the wrong thing or I'm just more discerning, the food was just okay.  To be honest, it is very hard to impress me with breakfast fare.  The ambiance is nice - spacious and clean.  Our waiter was spectacular - very diligent and friendly.  Portions were decent.  

Can't go wrong especially if you don't expect (I'll resist the easy pun) much."}
{"text":"Pretty awful. The smoked salmon was slimy and old-looking, the asparagus looked like it was cooked a week ago, toast was cold, the water glass stunk like egg and the potatoes were both burnt and cold. Everything about it was bad."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was great. We came here for lunch on our third day in Toronto and stopped by for breakfast right before we left ! The staff was so attentive we had a great time. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"A block from our hotel and it was always packed so we figure we should check it out.  It was good but then it's pretty hard to mess up eggs?  If you sit outside, service may be a bit slow as they get really busy.  The fresh fruit juices are delicious.  I liked the Oy Vegg (eggs came with potato latkes and sour cream) but the Eggspectation was decent too."}
{"text":"Great menu & pleasant occurrence upon arriving in Montreal after an overnight drive from New York (CITY!) Delicious BUT - if you have A/C - use it!"}
{"text":"Great Smoked Salmon Benny for a lazy Sat morning. Filling but not too heavy for breakfast."}
{"text":"Meal was absolutely perfectly done. The only complaint is the menu indicates a greek country salad and then served it with lettuce. I had asked to confirm that there was no lettuce before I ordered, he of course corrected the error. The menu should either be changed or correct the errors a country Greek salad should never have lettuce."}
{"text":"Very good eggsperience from the service to the food.  Breakfast poutine was nicely presented and the taste blended the flavors very well. Dessert crepes with strawberries and Nutella were delicious."}
{"text":"Kudos for opening on New Years Day. The interior and the vibe may suggest that the crowd only belongs Hipster elitists, but its quite the contrary. Service was excellent. However my only complaint is that the taste is not par with the presentation. I ordered a Cafe Mocha. It was filled to the brim with the super sweat whipped cream. The Mocha it self tasted like they used drip coffee instead of espresso. Ordered the American Classic for the breakfast. Sausages were tasted like salty brine. The roasted potatoes were soft, unfortunately even on the outside. I will give it another shot."}
{"text":"I like this breakfast place, I go there w my gf sometimes sunday mornings, they are pretty good. Their service is fast, their coffee is good, and all of their breakfast meals are delicious! Their in house coffee is OK, not the best, but not bad. I strongly recommend them."}
{"text":"My mom and I love this place!! The food is always consistent, they give good portions and the service is always great! The hostess Andrea is amazing, she's always cheerful and excited to see us! The smoked salmon benny is one of my faves!"}
{"text":"After hearing that the restaurant was closed on 220 Yonge St, I emailed the company and found out that a new nearby location was opened at 483 Bay St.

Thank God, now I can have my favorite egg Benedict again"}
{"text":"If you love Egg Benedicts this is the place to go. Very delicious breakfast. Very arty atmosphere. Excellent Bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict was outstanding. I had it montreal style, done with pastrami. It was amazing. The only thing is that our poor waitress was overworked, as she was working the entire upstairs alone. Great food, but understaffed."}
{"text":"It's our first time visiting Eggspectation at its new location. It's a busy sunday morning, and we didn't have to wait at all to be seated on the patio. The restaurant was clearly understaffed..  

We waited 30 minutes after we ordered and the food was still not here yet. (The table next to us ordered around the same time as us had already got their food..) We asked our server to check if our food's coming, he came back and said they lost our bill and we had to re-order again. Another 15 mins went by, and we still had not receive our food and the table next to us had already finished their meal and ready to pay. We asked one of the hostesses to get the manager.. and her response to us was \" we are very busy and the manager is very busy as well. He's not just standing there and doing nothing\". We were not impressed with her attitude at all, they really need to do some training with their staff. Fortunately the manager did come by and apologized for our wait (50 mins!) and offer to have the meal to be on the house which we really appreciated. 

The food was good and the price was very reasonable. 

I would not be so upset if the hostess wasn't being so rude to us. We also really appreciated the manager did take our complaint seriously and offer us a free meal. The two stars is solely based on our dining experience, i would give the food 4 stars."}
{"text":"I just thought it was OK. Nothing special, just typical western food. I had the lobster mac and cheese and it was pretty heavy and was too fishy for my taste.  The decor is lovely though."}
{"text":"Generally the food is pretty good; it's fast, and fresh and hot. I had the unfortunate experience of receiving the bad end with regards to the quality of their food today when I bit into a mouldy bagel. I'm not sure how it was able to pass from a chefs hands, to the manager inspecting the food at the pass, to the food runner, and then my table undetected. That is completely unacceptable and ruined my experience. I won't be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Patrons who apparently do not look \"cool\" enough to  have the pleasure of sitting on their cheap plastic seats outside their St. CATHERINE STREET location
Beware. We were told the terrace was for \"the bar only.\" How to insult the intelligence of your patrons in 30 seconds? Instead of seating them on the terrace, seat them inside of the glass in front of the bar so they can watch the food being served on the terrace and new comers being seated out there. We have not experienced such rude atrocious behavior of restaurant staff, the rude hostess in particular,  (@1:30pm for management)during our week long stay in Montreal, which other than this date, was exceptionally wonderful. No worries. We had a lovely lunch outside next door at Baton Rouge where they do not lie to their customer's faces."}
{"text":"The food was decent. Prices are about average. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place agin. The only upside was the waiter spent about 5 minutes giving us some tips on things to see and do in the area which was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I went there with 5 of my friends for a brunch in downtown and it was such a good experience. There is a lot of choice and everything looks so yummy. I finally ordered a smoked salmon benedict and it was perfectly done! One of my friend had the lobster mac'n'cheese haaaa now I know exactly what I will get next time!!!! Our waitress was really nice too and we all had a great time! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"On y est arrivé très tôt et on a gouté au délicieuses crêpes (pancakes) avec des fruits et du sirop d'érable : un régale !
Étant donné qu'on est arrivé très tôt, le serveur nous a placé très vite et le service a été rapide.
Les jus de fruits frais sont un régale, un endroit à recommander pour un petit des ou brunch !"}
{"text":"I came here twice on my trip to Toronto and it was great!

I ordered the Eggstravaganza which has everything in it such as eggs, ham, French toast, and potatoes. The second time I got the Waffles Page which was waffles with fruit and cream. Both times were so good and not overly sweet.

The server was super nice and helpful and the atmosphere is very nice and casual, great for a brunch place.

I would def come again!"}
{"text":"I think brunch places all serve similar food, so there's not much to say about food...but the staffs here are so friendly and nice, it always feels great after eating here! :D 
The waiter used to hand me extra cup of coffee in a  takeout cup on my way out on cold winter days. 
Also has a nice atmosphere; a great place to chill with your friends!"}
{"text":"The best meal we had during our Montreal trip.  Had breakfast on April 19th, and it was delicious.  Quick, friendly service, fresh food, and clean.  The water glasses were nice and spotless (unlike others we had during our trip), and even the hot water didn't have any funny taste, so you know the dishes are well-washed.  It was difficult to choose (massive menu), because everything sounded so yummy, but finally ended up with a veggie omelette and my hubby had the chocolate chip pancakes (with REAL maple syrup!).  Both were delicious :)"}
{"text":"The ambiance is cool here. The portions were huge, the food was absolutely delicious and very reasonably-priced! I would go back here in a heartbeat if I am in Montreal again."}
{"text":"I got up late today and decided to take a brunch near home. Then I searched and got Eggspectation. 
I ordered one of their most famous omelette. The southwest sunrise. The three omelette contained banana pepper and I guess it's homemade tomato sauce on top, with sliced avocado and sour cream. Oh and there was potato and three pieces of fruits by the side!
I love this combination! It's quite a nice choice for a balanced brunch. With fruits, eggs, and potatoes. Gotta try their pancakes next time!"}
{"text":"Great location and an excellent selection for breakfast and brunch options. I would eat my breakfast here everyday if I could. The only thing reason stopping me from giving them a full 5 stars is that both times I have visited the servers seemed very uninterested in working there. I am not expecting them to be super friendly but the service level was lacking."}
{"text":"In town from Miami and needed a great breakfast place besides the overpriced Hotel bistro. concierge recommended this place and  did not fail. We ordered the fruit smoothies and the Yoke around the clock and both were fantastic.great place to eat when in the dowtown Toronto area."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast in Montreal. I had pancakes and freshly squeezed orange juice, which were both amazing. I found that the pancakes reminded me of the taste of Belgian waffles, which was different and great at the same time. The orange juice was great as  well. Very sweet! The prices are very reasonable and the restaurant is set up in a perfect location. It is within walking distance to eaton centre. Will definitely have to come back again."}
{"text":"Noooo, no. Paid 30 dollars for two single bland waffles with cut up fruit on top. I hate being negative towards small businesses but I feel more than a little ripped off. Way overpriced"}
{"text":"Food was good. Price ok. The hostess sent us to the 2nd floor. Don't go to the 2nd floor.
For the owner to have the servers go up and down those steep stairs like that is despicable. Even a great waiter would have problem providing good service under these conditions. The serving staff is composed of students. Hence the simplest of request for a breakfast place becomes a chore."}
{"text":"Talk about great service with a smile. The eggs were perfect.  The fried potatoes and the French Toast with maple syrup was awesome."}
{"text":"Day trip to Toronto and needed breakfast. Usually I go to Frans (also great) but wanted to try a different restaurant. FOUND IT!!!! Eggspectation is wonderful. Great staff and service. I ordered the southwest sunrise. SO GOOD!!! Fresh, hot, filling. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am very surprised that there are not more reviews for this excellent restaurant.  My DD has taken a dozen visitors to Montreal to this restaurant and for good reason.  She took us there yesterday and we returned today.  Within the egg specialty their menu is very large and diverse.  Yes a simple two egg any style breakfast is available.  But so is a large variety eggs benny, omelettes and all manner of other egg dishes and egg combos.   Endless coffee refills.  All in all a good choice.
Our service was great on day one and just above OK on day two but 2nd day we had a clearly less experienced server.
We've now been travelling for nearly 10 weeks so know good  value when we eat it.
RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"Our family always have brunch here during our visit to Montreal. Staff are always nice, and the food is so good. Their bagels are okay; a little hard. Also, they only have sesame bagels for whatever bagel item on the menu. For example, their BLT is served on a bagel. A family member of ours had that.  The inside was great, but the bagel was hard. Aside from that, everything else is delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favourite joints for breakfast food, mostly because the quality is generally consistent, the french toast is tasty, and the food is non-greasy. I love my greasy food as much as the next person, but some days you want the oil to stay off your plate.

I love introducing this place to friends, and their wide range of food means there's something for everyone -- although I really wish the service wasn't so slow!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the place is great. Love the atmosphere, prices are good and food is great. I especially love the lobster omelette and the fact they serve wild salmon which tastes very fresh. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. Typical breakfast staple: eggs, crepes etc. They however .really need to keep up with cleanliness . Walls by the tables, floors are sticky. Multiple fruit flies having sharing your lunch. Would not go back for that reason."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Was waiting for a clean table for a long time and asked them politely multiple times to clean the table. Guess what? The group behind us got a table first.. Not worth going to given how mediocre the food is. I much prefer sunset grill and cora's..."}
{"text":"well,... high exception but high disappointed.  Food was just ok, service was slow. They put auto tip on my bill just 4 of us with a child. : ("}
{"text":"In a nutshell, high end decor and prices with cafeteria quality food... Beautiful decor, great vibe and excellent service but what counts is the food and although the options were plenty and presentation beautiful, the quality was meh. Coffee was weak and disappointing, plus cream and sugar were in single serve packets - a very low end presentation at these prices. Bacon was cheap, fatty and barely cooked. Multigrain toast was straight out of a bag of WonderBread. Potatoes were mushy and bland. Very disappointing overall, was hoping this would be my new go-to place"}

{"text":"Traveling with the family, I was looking online for the most kid-friendly restaurants in Montreal and Eggspectation popped up in a top ten list someone posted on their blog.  They didn't steer us wrong.  We sat down quickly, the service was super friendly, my kids were crazy but that didn't seem to bother anyone and they made fast friends with the waitstaff.  The menu was huge and gave us plenty of options.  The fresh OJ was super good and the food was fantastic - I had the steak and eggs, my kids got pancakes and fruit (which was so plentiful and fresh my husband and I snacked on it too), and my husband got the full round of eggs, toast, pancakes and sausages.  Everyone left fully satisfied and happy, and we even came back after walking around the neighborhood for a bit to get one of their smoothies which didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Un extrait de mets plutôt Anglais avec du pain plutôt Germain ; accompagné de fruits . C'est original et sain pour le corps . Une bonne idée ."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend there the morning of a matinee jays game and was blown away by the menu...it was a tough choice but I had the steak and eggs and my better half had an omelette with salsa on top.

The food came and I was impressed, steak was a nice cut and grilled the way I like it and I had a bit if the omelette which was great!

The Interior was nice and clean and wait staff professional and friendly, best part about this place was the price for an amazing breakfast.

Highly recommend for vacationers or residents of Toronto!"}
{"text":"Best place ever wish Whitehorse had one.  Great food and great service. Have returned for a second time and was not disappointed."}

C'est un peu bruyant.
C'est pas mal.
Mais c'est surtout beaucoup moins bien que L'Avenue !"}
{"text":"Went there for summerlicious 2017 and had a  table booked online days before for 11:30am. Waited for 10 mins without anyone even noticing us although 3-4 waiters in checkered shirts passed by and we had to call a waiter cleaning a table who said he was going to do something and then proceed to ignore us as he continued to clean. Restaurant was starting to fill just like another regular lunch hour time (we've been there before several times).

The waitress serving us was very pushy in having us ordering from the regular menu when we asked for the summerlicious menu saying that the waiting time was 30 mins or more . When we asked for the summerlicous menu again, she was like \"it's up to you whatever.\" 
Given it was office lunch hour and we were short on time, we ended ordering one item from the regular menu that *still* took 30 mins to get to us and  was more expensive that the summerlicious menu. 

We had 2 tables around us with people who came after us and got their food before us. One table ordered the summerlicous (arrived same time as us) and immediately had their entree and their main by the time we received our food. When we left, we explained our disappointment to the waitress who started to give some lame excuse that had no head or tail.

Disappointed? Yes. If a restaurant cannot keep up with the demands, then they should not participate in such events as Summerlicious. Telling us some lame excuse to have us order from the regular menu is not ok especially if we had to wait 30  mins for the regular menu. We went to other places for summerlicious/winterlicious where our orders were fast and we were not pushed into ordering the regular menu. 

In addition, we did not like the pushy and condescending attitude of the waitress when we asked for the summerlicious menu.

They also have a dinner menu for $28 but the restaurant closes at 5pm.. Go figures..

Definitely not coming back as there're other places in Toronto that can have my money."}
{"text":"Great food. Good coffee. Very good prompt service. Great with kids. Fairly priced.  Nice location. we will return."}
{"text":"Very loud, overpriced mediocre food, poor ventilation and not a place for kids. Surrounded by hung over college kids dropping F bombs every 9 words.  Including the girls. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. I mean for breakfast, I dont expect so much. Its all about the place and the people, which I love about this place. But I am not saying that I dont love the food. My family went here to have breakfast right after Christmas, there are 10 of us and everyone loves it. 
Its quite packed on that day, but I can tell that its always busy like that everyday since all the table and chairs are positioned very closed to each other. I dont mind it. I especially dont like breakfast places where it is so quite that make me want to get back to my bed. 
The only thing that make me rate only 4 star is that they dont have a waiting area. So when its too busy, there are a lot of people standing at the door and that is the only way to get into the place as well. 
But I would definitely go back to Eggspectation for breakfast."}
{"text":"The food is quite good. It's a neat spot but it would be better if they had a terrace on the roof! Even if you don't like eggs, you'll find something you can eat on the menu; lots of selection. But it's not that cheap, honestly I find breakfasts shouldn't be more than 7$, that's just me in my tax free haven!"}
{"text":"Did a take out from here for my hubby to eat. I got Lobster Omelet. Pretty decent. But a bit pricy.....but people are so sweet."}
{"text":"this food was seriously wrong, it did not seem fresh... almost like it was spoiled. the pancake was frozen for sure and the eggs made me nauseous... my friend's omelette was not fresh either. i dont know if its only our food or the day but i will never go again. If you like some hotel's breakfast like the free ones that are frozen, then you might like this."}
{"text":"Exceeded my Eggspectation

My family and I visited this place on a Sunday morning without any expectations since we had read a few mixed reviews. I'm so glad that we decided to come here. The food was excellent. We had eggs, potatoes (well seasoned and tasty), ham, bacon, sausages, (Canadian bacon and ham are the truly the best!), and (I dare say) some of the best French toast and pancakes that I have ever tasted. And of course one cannot forget the locally made maple syrup; exquisite. For drinks we had freshly squeezed orange juice, pineapple juice, and grapefruit juice; simply divine! Despite the place being filled to capacity and the service being a bit delayed as a result our waitress was attentive and tended to our every need. I highly recommend this spot for anyone looking for inexpensive and yummy breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"I really enjoy there variety of all day breakfast!! Really yummy. Fast service. Good location right next to the Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"Best all day breakfast joint I have ever had! Amazing food and quality. I ordered French Toast with strawberries, bananas and walnuts.  i highly recommend tryin it. Montréal has the best breakfast resto in da world. I enjoyed every minute of it. Kinda on pricey side but well worth it. I also order a bowl of cafe latte and it was delicious. All said and done the experience was great, the vibe was fun and the service was exceptional. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"If you like your eggs to taste like cooking spray this is the place to be. Awful! The best part of this place was the water."}
{"text":"Food is only one part of an experience of eating out and although the food is definitely acceptable the cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired. I would suggest the owners and management put some time and consideration into cleaning the washrooms and the general up keep of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I come here every time I am in town!  The menus is pretty standard and I always giggle a little at the price for anything smoked salmon (extremely pricey for a girl from the west cost).  But other than that you can get a pretty good meal here.  I was also very please to see that they don't charge extra for egg whites only.  Its been super busy every time I've been here.  There is always a line up.  I visit Toronto 4 times a year so I can't say it is because of the holiday season or anything."}
{"text":"Me and my buddies we're in Toronto for the New Years and came across this place in a magazine. The waiter was really polite and food was excellent! He made some recommendations and it did not disappoint. I had the Greek Omelette and added avocado. Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Super yummy brunch place! This restaurant is in a very convenient area( close to shopping and ttc etc.) The wait was a little long but once we were seated the service was fast. The food came very quickly when ordered and was delicious! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The sustain is pleasing, and the food was pleasing. The prices are moreover totally reasonably priced compared to some of the add-on restaurants. The daily specials conscious the menu."}
{"text":"Reasonable priced food if you are in that area. Best breakfast spot and decent lunch offerings. Food is flavorful and there is many options. Eggs to crepes to french toast. 

5/5"}
{"text":"The eggs are not even good and you'd expect them to be because 1. EGGspectation and 2. You can't mess up breakfast   Breakfast is my favorite meal and I love avocados so it's a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Wonderful place with a nice ambiance. Perfect place for a brunch. They have a variety of eggs and waffle dishes. I loved their cafe au lait too! Large portions for a decent price.
Even if you're not going there for brunch, they have lots of other dishes for you. Definitely a must visit when in Toronto"}
{"text":"The food here was good but not great, the service ok. The food did come out of the kitchen pretty quickly, but we only saw our waitress about twice & had to ask for coffee several times. I shared two different egg Benedict dishes with a friend. The California dream (without asparagus) was pretty disappointing. The eggs & hollandaise sauce were ok, but there was only a tiny piece of smoked salmon laying on top of one of the (smaller than average) eggs. The plate was mostly just pilled with potatoes and multi grain toast placed over the dish. The Montreal Style Benedict faired a little better with very 2 thin small slices of smoked meat. The fries may have been fresh but tasted a little stale (or from frozen). My overall impression was that this is just one step up from fast food, pretty disappointing considering the all the great reviews and pricing. I probably won't be eating there again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Will never go back. 
Was with a party of 4. Waitress knocked over ice water giving us our menus and spilled it all over my crotch. Took all of our orders. Food arrives for everyone else at the table except me; I tell my friends not to wait. It takes almost 10 minutes for my french toast to arrive because they forgot my order! At the end of it all, everything is full price; the manager would not even comp us a coffee! I was insulted and vowed never to return."}
{"text":"The ham, egg, and three cheese crepe fed me for two days and, in all reality, could have probably fed me for three!  It was much better on day one, but it was probably one of the best crepes I've ever had in my life.  It was like eating a crepe from a street cart in France (only a bit more expensive).  Also, there's lots of good modest egg decor which just made me happy.  I did have to knock a star off because the service was just that bad.  We didn't see our waiter for a solid 30+ minutes after finishing our food, and we were pretty limited on time."}
{"text":"The place is just ok. The plate was a bit cold and they are low on lobster. I like the outdoor seating. The positive is that if you are very hungry the food comes out quick."}
{"text":"Found this one on Yelp.  Breakfast was delicious. A little on the pricey side but definitely worth it for the good food and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place does great steak and eggs. Or, if you're feeling as adventurous as my wife, you can have a poached egg with pancakes and sausages - which she assured me was delicious as a combination. Service was very friendly and efficient, and I would definitely recommend it for people looking for a filling breakfast/brunch as we were."}
{"text":"Eggspectations is an odd duck; a contrast of restaurant styles rarely seen among any setting, let alone brunch. The name alone kept me from visiting for months. But what surprised me most of all was how much I enjoyed the food!

The name is intentional. Groan-eliciting, as the awkward puns continue throughout the menu. The staff is constantly on the run, either too distracted to serve or too busy not to fill the room. Their hours make little sense. I was all but ready to write the place off as a higher-class, expensive Denny's.

Then I tried the food, and my opinion swung entirely in the opposite direction. The platter special was clean, well laid out - as well as I'd expect from a good dining restaurant - and the flavor was fabulous. (Yes, that mix of French Toast and sides I've been scouring the city for!) What first was a silly minor chain restaurant was actually a great breakfast staple for De Maisonneuve! 

It will lose a little allure in the Montreal Winter when the outdoor and semi-outdoor seating is gone, but this is one breakfast I know I can rely on any day of the week."}
{"text":"Overall not bad.  Nice breakfast place.  Good coffee.  Charged $1.50 for Multi-grain toast... That was toasted probably 30 minutes before I got there.  Great service."}
{"text":"Great vibe. Great food excellent customer service. Get there early!! Wait time after 11am is usually 30 min

I ordered the waffle bacon eggs Benedict (delicious) but they only give you half a Belgian waffle."}
{"text":"Agreed! Poached eggs are perfect, orange juice freshly squeezed. Yum!"}
{"text":"Loved it. It is the best place to have brunch at on any day. 
Superb selection and good ambience. Not too pricey and we loved the delicious dishes."}
{"text":"Decent brunch spot, at least if you are dead set on eating downtown (personally I think there are much better options elsewhere, but that's just me). 

This is a good place to go if you are just hungry for a classic breakfast/brunch, and don't want any surprises. It is neither awful nor exceptional. Not super memorable one way or another."}
{"text":"The reviews might have finally gotten to the owners.  We had a great waiter, memorized the whole order.  Quick service.  Great cappuccino.  My wife loved the juices.

Eggs are hard to mess up but some places do.  We had bad breakfast the day before.  We didn't have big expectations but really liked the place."}
{"text":"When the food came to the table and It was freezing cold, and we were served by someone who clearly didn't want to be there. The Louisiana style fries were cold and dry, and the whole meal was just awful."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I always have a hard time finding a place that serves more than breakfast in the morning. This place has everything. And it's fantastic! Best tuna panini I have ever eaten!! Fresh hand squeezed juices every day too. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had fish and chips during lunch and it was very oily. It was not expensive though, around $13 and comes with soup of the day. Outdoor seating is a nice option on a sunny day."}
{"text":"Because we're a pack of rebels, we don't order a single egg-based dish. 

The banana french toast flambe.  How can you go wrong with brown sugar, butter, and brandy?  The yogurt has a nice tang to it, confirming that it's not Dannon.  The crepes, however, disappoint me with their stubborn and resistant texture.  Strange that out of all the creperies I've known in the last 10 years, the one in J-town in SF (you know the one I'm talking about) is still my favorite.  

Would be 4 stars, except the waiter won't move us inside when the decision to eat outside turned out to be an arctic mistake.  Something about no four-tops available, although I observed otherwise on my way to and from the bathroom.  What is this, the back of the bus?"}
{"text":"Yes, I went to Eggspectation and didn't try the eggs. Twice.

And yet, I'm happy ...

The first time, I went with a friend - she had the burger and fries, and I ordered the tropical salad (the one with mangoes). Stole one of my friend's fries and had to order a side of fries for myself. Don't be fooled: the \"side\" is a large serving of fries! My friend and her little one had to help me finish up the fries - not that it was a chore: the fries are shoestring fries - crisp and delicious. No gravy, sadly. Wish they'd add that to the menu.

The next time, I had the bacon-cheddar burger and asked for an extra topping of sauteed mushrooms. Delicious! The beef was perfectly cooked and juicy. The fries, again, were superlative. You know the only reason I go to burger joints is if the fries are good, right? 

Decided to splurge on dessert since I'd actually skipped lunch - ordered the \"Joe's favourite\" - two strawberry-and-banana filled crepes, drizzled with chocolate sauce, a la mode. I'd say give the crepes a miss - they are not light and fluffy, but rather a heavy, doughy crepe. More of a pancake flavour than a true crepe.

So, stick with the main egg dishes or even the burgers and you won't be disappointed. Skip dessert. Or head off to your favourite dessert place instead."}
{"text":"After eating for years at the eggspectations in Montreal, unfortunately this Toronto location fails to deliver the same high food quality I had come to expect. However the menu is diverse and reasonably priced making it good for a last minute go to place if you have run out of all other options."}
{"text":"We were looking for a family dinner spot after a long day of sightseeing in Montreal. As usual, we were trying to find a space that catered to our youngest (whose menu is very limited), but would satisfy everyone else. This menu seemed to fit the bill - in addition to eggs of all varieties, they have a dinner menu. We didn't try anything exotic, but the eggs benedict and california benedict we tried were great. (We love eggs benedict). Portions were large, coming with fruit/ potato slices. We arrived at the peak of dinner hour, but the host found us a table. While there were only two servers, they never stopped moving and provided good and friendly service even with their hands full. There were non-egg items on the menu, but we didn't try them."}
{"text":"The menu had plenty of egg related puns which I enjoyed. The food came quickly and tasted great. What pushed this review to a 5 star was our waiter who brought out a map of Montreal and drew out around 10 attractions with detailed directions on each one. He was truly great! It was our first day in after visiting from NYC."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Toronto. The pancakes are fluffy and the maple syrup is the best i've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Deeply disappointing. Went here because my friend heard of good reviews, the menu looked great and my friends were on a weekend vacation to Montreal. The service was the worst any of us experienced and we've wasted more than 2 hours here on what should have not took any longer than an hour because it took so long to get seated, get our drinks, order and get our food, with 30 minute chunks of time from an absent waitress. 

When we asked to speak to the manager, our apathetic waitress was the manager and acted so dismissive of our concerns, just saying \"ok\" without apologizing for wasting so much of our time. The place was busy, but business was no excuse because we saw people who came in later than us get served their food, pay their bill and leave before us. When my friend told the waitress we were tourists from Toronto, she flinched a bit. I had to constantly remind the waitress to bring my ice-cream or utensils because she kept on \"forgetting.\" The food was OK, but service was worst and have never been treated the way we have by the manager."}
{"text":"I am really not sure what the hype is here. Let me start with the positive:

1. the space - this is a really cool old building, lots of exposed brick, lots of space and lots of light. 

2. the servers - fast, friendly and just all around good service. 

thats about it, the food was, at best, plain. I had the calssic benny, which seems hard to mess up, but everything felt very rushed. THe eggs were undercooked(quite a bit) and the hollandaise was definitely a mix, not from scratch. My GF had a mix of yogurt, scrambled eggs and toast. It was all just kind of sloppy. I honestly can't remember the last time I haven't enjoyed a brunch(its my favorite meal of the day) so it was a real dissappointment to be let down here, especially with all the high ratings here. 

As we left, the lineup to get in was about 30 people long, and they all looked like university students. Seems like this may be the most popular morning after the bar place for the university crowd."}
{"text":"I stopped here for breakfast recently on the last day of a weekend trip to Montreal and had a great meal.  I ordered the veggie crepe, which came with mushrooms, peppers, cheese, etc., with some salad greens on the side.  It was delicious and also really large and filling.  Reasonably priced, too.  The service was friendly and the restaurant itself had a fun, eclectic vibe.  I wouldn't say that anything about it is necessarily unique, but for diner/breakfast food it's solid.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food, day old potatoes, old fruit....stay away.  Our server was nice (Maud)."}
{"text":"Eggspectations is an amazing restaurant but this particular branch has the WORST service on planet earth . I think the owner/manger should really consider doing something or otherwise people will stop coming . I come frequently because I live close but i still get bad service each and every time. Now i go to the Branch next to Place-des-Arts even if it was a longer walk but at least i will be welcomed with smile & I get the very simple Fresh Pepper that i wouldn't get here coz the hostess it too lazy to get it from inside .
I had a dirty fork once and it took her like 10 min to get me another one and the food was cold by then & she didn't even said sorry ."}
{"text":"I usually try to avoid big chains when I travel, but I think I've developed a soft spot for this place. On a recent week-long trip to Montreal I went here twice for breakfast. 

The menu is enormous, so no matter what your tastes are you'll be sure to find several things to your liking. I am a big fan of the fruit cup and fruit plate. Loads of fresh, perfectly ripe fruit. So refreshing on a warm summer morning! I love when a restaurant serves decent fruit in their fruit cup. So often it's dull, canned, under ripe junk. Not here.  

My dining companions enjoyed their bagel and lox, crepes, and muffins. Come to think of it, no one in my party had any egg dishes. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Popped in for Saturday brunch, as a friend wanted to try it out after hearing rave reviews. I did a quick Yelp-check on my phone before walking in and read that the French toast and egg choices are the go-to. 

So, I ordered the plate with two pieces of French toast, eggs any style, sausage, and potatoes. 

Verdict? Not bad, but definitely far from amazing. The French toast was kinda disappointing actually, tasted more like brioche (and not-so-good brioche at that). My fried eggs were made just the way I like it, but let's face it, it's pretty hard to screw up fried eggs, right? Sausage was the regular sausage links and the grilled potatoes were *gasp* deep fried potato coins! Blasphemy! 

Should've gone for the eggs benny or omelette choices, maybe those are better. Also, service was... um... spotty."}
{"text":"Ate here on my first morning in Montreal.  The front desk at the hotel we stayed at strongly recommended it.  I certainly wasn't disappointed. 
Eggs Benny is one of my favorite things.  When I found they had a version with guacamole and gruyere cheese on it, I couldn't say no!  It was DELISH! 
Our server was great!  It was very busy however he made sure we were well taken care of and had everything we needed.  
Given how busy it was we were braced for a long wait.  However were surprised to find our food came out pretty quickly and was piping hot.  Clearly the kitchen crew has it all figured out! 
This is a great breakfast spot that comes highly recommended!  We liked it so much we went back on our last day in Montreal."}
{"text":"First breakfast in Toronto, Canada! Delicious! Can't wait to go again! the best breakfast I had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I had the fresh squeezed and smores French Toast. Marshmallows, Nutella,  and maple syrup, along with a strawberry and banana chocolate fondue. To die for!"}
{"text":"The service was alright but the food was not that good. I had the strawberry waffles and it was really dry, even with the maple sirup. The grapefruit juice was clearly fresh, but had so much seed in it, that it was a little annoying. Overall, it was kinda expensive for what it was."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning. Worst time to go, EVER!  Slow service, sub-par dishes, and an extremely loud environment made for the most forgettable brunch I've ever had.  

Honestly, how can anyone f*** up bacon, eggs, and sausage?? HOW?????"}
{"text":"Food is average. Service is mostly good. 

Tried almost every breakfast plate as well as the burgers.

Look elsewhere for good eats."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast restaurant with lots of choices. A little hard to find as the address is on Bay Street but the entrance is actually on a side street."}
{"text":"Okay service. Waited long for one worker to serve 3 tables. Didn't get my complimentary bread and everyone around who is local got it. Food was room temperature, not hot. If you are American and don't speak French, don't go here."}
{"text":"Dodgy, dodgy grub. 
Stale potatoes, runny poached eggs. 
Uncomfortable outdoor chairs, wobbly tables. 

Nice green smoothies and juices though."}
{"text":"this place is terrible! was searching for best eggs benny in town and yelp led me to this place. looked great upon arrival and the menu made everything sound delicious. so i ordered classic eggs benny and i couldn't believe it..it was like sliced deli ham (?!?) and a shitty square of cheddar that wasn't even fully melted. eggs were hard and not runny at all. for a place that boasts it's bennys i couldn't believe they don't use higher quality ingredients. don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Really enjoyed everything: great food, location, and staff!!! Lots of menu options.   Cozy 2 story restaurant in shopping complex on corner of major street.   Busy this Sunday morning but served within no time.  Staff very friendly and bilingual.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong for breakfast with eggspectations. We always go to this spot before e toto the track for the formal 1 race. 
We generally have 8 o so people all getting different things from eggs Benedict, pancakes or omelets and we never leave their disappointed."}
{"text":"I visited for weekend brunch in the new location, which was up to the usual high standard.  The Lyonnaise-style potatoes are always the high point of Eggspectations, and the bacon is almost as good - it manages to be a little crispy without being overcooked charcoal and is consistently delicious.  

The waitress I had at the new location was a little cringe-worthy - smacking my hand and telling me to stop biting my nails... not really the way I'd expect to be treated as a customer.  I think she was new and a little nervous, so hopefully she learns."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast... 10 minute walk from our hotel.  Had the All American.  2 eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, potatoes and toast. $10 Canadian.  Double espresso was excellent.  My brother had the Montreal BLT and said it was good, brother in law had bagel with lox, he enjoyed it as well... would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Ate there recently with colleagues while in town on business and the food was awesome!!! The orange juice, while for many may not be a big deal, was AMAZING!!!! It was fresh squeezed!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Ate here every morning for my stay in Toronto. Busy atmosphere but service is fast and friendly. Excellent food. By far the best French toast I've ever had. Also the California dreaming is delish. Must go !"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much given it's a chain restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered the egg sandwich on a Montreal bagel and my husband ordered the western omelette. The service was great and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Though chain restaurants are not my favorite, Eggspectation is worth tasting, if you are looking for a balanced and tasty breakfast option in Montreal."}
{"text":"Beautiful presentation and delicious food! Close to hotel and came because of a Groupon. Will be recommending to family and friends. Wish waiter was more friendly though"}
{"text":"For some reason every time my dad comes to visit me in Toronto he wants to go to to either Eggspectation or the Pickle Barrel rather than any of the cool, unique and wonderful restaurants the city offers. I don't get it, but since he's the one paying I just go with it.

Obviously this restaurant is a no-go for vegans, but even for vegetarians the options are pretty limited, especially considering the size of the menu. They didn't have a veggie burger alongside the 6+ other burger options, and I think the only vegetarian sandwich option was a grilled cheese. They offer a vegetarian omelette (which I ordered and which was not very good) and of course there are crepes and pancakes that can be ordered without meat. So yes, technically it has vegetarian options; it's just not very *good* veg fare."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Food was delicious. We ate outside under an umbrella and I think it was better than sitting inside which had a very dark interior."}
{"text":"For breakfast, this is the place in downtown Montreal.
Great two tiered loft type seating as well as outdoor tables make for a comfortable pleasant setting. The fruit juice is fresh as is the large variety of fruit accompanying many dishes even if you don't order  the amazing fruit plate. Pancakes ,eggs, granola were all tasty and in solid portions. Great omelette choices. A little more than you might ordinarily pay for breakfast but a good value for the quality."}
{"text":"This was fine for a breakfast joint. Prices were reasonable and the waitstaff was great. The only problem was how long it took the food to come out. Even though it wasn't busy it still took about 30 minutes before our breakfast was served."}
{"text":"The last time I came here it was definitely 5 stars, this time around the food just didn't seem as top notch for some reason. I tried the Benedict with benefits and it wasn't very good. The pancakes are amazing as always though. Service, speed and pricing are all still great though."}
{"text":"Food presentation 5/5
Taste 3/5
Service 1/5
Cleanliness 3
Decor:4
Place looks nice and very very busy.Service was way below average.bunch of young college kids that just want to have you pay the tips and leave.
The macchiato was warmish and tasted horrible.regardless that I got it after I got my omelette, it arrived kinda warm not hot as it should be.
The south west omelette was nothing special about it.The eggs were raw almost, regardless of asking to have it well done.
Bathroom was very dirty, and no paper towels.
Will never come back"}
{"text":"Great late breakfast joint. Lots of healthier menu options and the service is really tight."}
{"text":"The Montreal location is far better than the Toronto Or Chicago location! Absolutely delicious. Perfect place to come for a fast and hearty breakfast WFH healthy options. Quality is 5 stars."}
{"text":"Don't sit upstairs.  Hostess is RUDE.  Yelled at me for sitting down without her help, but she wasn't there when I got there.  So she wouldn't give me a menu.  Then, sat another group at my table when I, hadn't paid yet."}
{"text":"For a couple who loves to explore and find new places to eat, we found Eggspectation on our first day in Montreal and then never looked for another breakfast spot.  I don't recall the last time we did that.  For eight different breakfasts over four days we never found a meal we didn't love.  

Whether it was the Sugar Shack (Scrambled eggs, potatoes, ham and crepes bretonne), the French Toast Flambe (French toast with bananas, strawberries and walnuts in triple sec) the Eggtravaganza (two eggs, French toast, choice of breakfast meat and potatoes), Yolk Around the Clock (a split Montreal bagel with eggs fried in the holes and covered with cheese), French Toast, Healthy Start (Eggs and fruit), French Toast Pagen(with fruit and Crème Anglais), or Pancakes Page they were all wonderful.  The potatoes are lyonaisse style which is 1/4 inch thick slices which are then cooked, finished in the fryer and served with sautéed sweet onions and parsley.  Absolutely fantastic.  Of course, only pure Canadian Maple Syrup was served when required.

So maybe, eight meals in four days is a lot.  However, we feel there are several menu items we have yet to discover."}
{"text":"Rien que le joli jeu de mot de ce restaurant valait le détour. Recommandée pour faire de bons brunchs, je m'y suis précipitée pour l'essayer. Et pour cause, la carte est IMMENSE et c'est un vrai défi de choisir un seul plat à manger. Plein de jus, plein de pancakes, de burgers, d'oeufs et omelettes, d'assiettes de brunchs, et autres, autres, autres. 

Je me suis finalement décidée pour le classique pancakes sirop d'érable et j'ai également craqué pour leur jus d'orange fraîchement pressé (Miam, mes papilles s'en souviennent!) et un bol de yaourt fruits et miel. Ce fut un délice, les portions étaient immenses pour ma seule petite personne et je n'ai d'ailleurs pas pu finir. Mon cur voulait, mais mon ventre ne pouvait plus. L'attente fut à mon goût un peu trop longue d'où l'étoile en moins, mais le service était très agréable et la nourriture succulente. Un presque sans faute, donc!"}
{"text":"The burger BBQ is very tasty; I'd recommend you. Waitress are very nice and peaceful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tolerable. Waffles are good, fruit is fresh and crunchy, egg breakfeast looked good... BUT. Now im not trying to be critical..but i guess i was expecting better... the chocolate sauce they served with wafffles is gross... grainy and clearly overcooked, super watery and tart... they say its real chcocolate and they stand by it but its just plain gross. My husband got pankakes and they were pretty terrible as well. It came with like 5 bluberrys. Maple syrup on the other hand is tasty. They are a bit slow to refill your coffee and to bring the bill. A good variety for the menu. Maybe i got a bad day and usually its ok."}
{"text":"Very good experience for Saturday breakfast or brunch, whatever's you call it around 9:0 am
The locations is few steps away from eaton center.
Our server was polite and friendly.
Egg Benedict was perfectly cooked and the side potato was fresh, coffee is bottomless 
While we were leaving there was a lineup, so go there early to avoid the queue. 
We will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Everything delicious. We had eggs Benedict over waffles and the classic. Amazing potatoes and we liked everything"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good, basic brunch/lunch place.  The decor is cute and not over-the-top, and the wait staff are friendly and well-versed.  The smoothies are tasty and the food is always of fair quality.  

I've had some absolutely great experiences there as well as some not-so-hot ones.  I was recently unimpressed with their potato latkes as I find they lack texture although they are seasoned well. Overall, it's a place that I don't usually turn down but rarely go out of my way for."}
{"text":"I have previously reviewed Eggspectation and found its kitchen creations excellent. They appear to have improved their service significantly since I last shared my opinions. As promised, therefore, four stars well-deserved. 

The menu has been revamped and the quirkiness and puns are mostly gone, but the eggs surely aren't. I think I will miss the great variety of dishes one could select from, however they seem to focus on a core set of competences these days and churn out a very pleasant palette of flavors.

With the sad departure of a couple of my brunch haunts, my trekking over a kilometre to Eggspectation shows it's good, filling and pleasant."}
{"text":"I used to love going to the smaller, old location on Yonge, at the Eaton Centre, where the decor was really charming and the food was always spot-on. Now I've been to this larger location a few times and it's only been \"meh\". It's pretty noisy and the overall experience has been a bit off - cold food, warm smoothies, overdone poached eggs, indifferent service... I hope things will improve."}
{"text":"This place is such a great breakfast option! I had their french toast which came piled with fruit and a cup of fresh squeezed orange juice. The decor is very modern and features a spiral staircase leading to the upstairs seating. They have a huge menu ranging from just about every breakfast option you can think of. Definitely a great place to stop in before a day of sightseeing in Montreal."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.

The first experience was one of the worst dining/service experiences I have ever had.  I was with a group of 6 people.  It was a busy Saturday, so it was understandable that the restaurant was busy. We waited 20-30 minutes, which I think was reasonable for that time and for a bigger group. However, when we sat down, we probably waited another 10 minutes for service.  We were not greeted, there was no acknowledgement that we were there.  Again, I understand that it was a busy rush period, but a quick \"Hey, sorry for the wait, I'll be with you as soon as possible\" would have been better than being ignored completely.  The food also took quite some time, although I can't remember exactly how long.  The food itself was okay, not great but not terrible either.  We tried to get our server's attention several times, but every time he would walk by, as if he were avoiding us on purpose.  Some in my group asked for coffee refills, they never came, even after a few reminders.  It was just bizarre.  I saw our server running around a lot, but again, no attention was given to us.  Then, when it came time for billing, we waited for what seemed like forever.  At one point, it looked like our server was ready to process us as he stood at the head of the table, but then he looked over to the table next to us, and without a word, walked away to process their bills first!  We all looked at each other with confused looks, and proceeded to wait another 20 minutes.  This happened again, where our server walked by us completely, ignoring the fact that we were waiting to pay and leave, and proceeded to clean the table next to us first.  It was incredibly frustrating and a little insulting.  The entire experience really left me with a bad impression.

Having said that, I went again during a less busy period, thinking it might be better the second time and perhaps with a different server.  No such luck.  This time, it was just 2 of us.  Since there were only a few tables in the restaurant, we were seated right away.  However, we still waited about 10 minutes before being greeted.  I wasn't in a rush so I didn't mind and took the time to look at the menu.  When are server finally got to us, it seemed to be going better, but then we still had to wait an unreasonable time for food (considering how empty the restaurant was).  Our food arrived, and it actually looked pretty good.  Unfortunately, my boyfriend's Eggs Benedict wasn't as good as it looked.  He ordered 3 eggs, instead of 2, which had an extra charge.  One egg was hard boiled.  The second egg was filled with water, which exploded onto the plate after he cut into it.  There was also no yolk in it...  He didn't bother with the third and we brought this to the attention of our server, who apologized and said a new plate would be made.  Surprisingly, minutes later, he came back with a \"new\" plate.  Coincidentally, another table had ordered the same thing and it was ready so he decided he would give us the other table's plate instead.  I guess he thought this would be better because we wouldn't have to wait, but it was a little unprofessional and somewhat gross since the plate looked like it had already been sitting out for awhile.  The \"new\" eggs were slightly better (in that they were not hard boiled and not filled with water), but the whole experience was again, bizarre.  Our server did not compensate for the mistake, not that we expected the entire bill to be compensated, but at the very least, he should not charged us for the extra egg.  Anyway, the entire bill came to about $50 after tax and tip.  Ridiculous for a less than mediocre meal and a poor, mind-boggling experience.  

In this case, the three strikes and you're out rule does not apply.  I would not recommend eating here, and I will never be back.  This place is overpriced and disappointing, with some of the worst service I've experienced.  There are much better breakfast/brunch spots in the city by a long shot."}
{"text":"The orange juice is good, but the eggs benedict contains a lot of green onion which makes me feel disgusted. More importantly, when I try to make the payment, a mandatory tips applied in my bill. Of course I will give you the tips if I think the service is good, but what does the mandatory tip means?i will never go to your store again."}
{"text":"The outside seating was desirable nice. The corny eggxpected slogans were quite amusing and delightful refreshing to see, a restaurants person-ability.

Coffee: expresso which I would have liked hotter but was adequate for my taste.

Entree: egg omelette was delicious, wished it might have been filled with more stuff than just a little melted cheese. The potatoes were crisp and soft in the middle. Fruit on the side definitely help make the plate color pop out with the avocados and salsa. 

Overall: enjoyable experience with friendly service staff, the time wait when we finished to the time we got the check was longer than usual, not in a rush so it didn't matter but was noted."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service and surroundings and lived up to eggspectations 
Eggcellent value for money."}
{"text":"Dreadful.
Was the only customer and it still took 15 minutes for eggs benedict.
1 egg was way over done, the other one just under.
Menu said \"two perfectly poached eggs\". Don't put things like that on the menu if you can't cook eggs.
their pistou sauce smelled like something purchased in cheap deli several months ago.
Cheap ingredients, no balance in the dish."}
{"text":"Food was good. Takes a while to get your food. We have been their twice. We would go back again. Some gluten free options but not many. I ordered the Montrealer and it came with a pickle (that's what it said on the menu) and on my plate they gave me a sliver of a pickle... about 1/10th of a pickle. Better than  Tutti Frutti. I would recommend the dish but ask for a full pickle or else you will receive a bite of one."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in town.  We have been coming here for years.  Even before they have moved.  Always great food, awesome selection of drinks and breakfast choices. We come here every time we visit Toronto.  Never ever have we been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am from Hong Kong and on vacation in Toronto visiting my friends. Search this place through Yelp. It is a recommended place for breakfast and brunch, staffs are helpful and the food is great. We waited around 20 mins and they text me when the table is ready. I ordered the avocado Benedict's egg, love it."}
{"text":"Came here to get fuelled up before an incredibly \"busy\" day bag-hunting at MEC and all I can say is \"WOW\". First, flights to Iceland starting at $99, and now this deliciousness? WOW.

It was already busy when my friend and I arrived (~10:45-11am Saturday), but after taking down our names we waited for less than 5 minutes. When we left at 11:30, there was a huge queue!

Restaurant size:
Plenty of tables and a large patio area, but if it's busy you're going to have to wait at least 5 minutes. On this chilly Nuit Blanche day, the temperature and atmosphere was quite warming.

Portion size:
Spot on! My friend and I decided to split a lobster omelette and chicken benny, and our stomachs were still very, very happy at around 4pm. This says a lot, since we're usually gluttons, eating AYCE restaurants out of business!

Service:
Au contraire to what others have experienced, we had great service from our waiters. When we asked one about the wifi password, she admitted it was her first day and didn't know. Unexpectedly, she returned shortly with it!

When it was time for the bill, the waiter took the initiative to ask if we wanted to split the food amongst our separate bills, which was perfect! Impressive to us, since other places usually don't take the effort to make this available.

Food quality:
I had a foodgasm from the first mouthful of the lobster omelette. 
I had another foodgasm from the mouthful of chicken benny.
However, while the Lyon-style home fries were nicely portioned, soft and fluffy, it could have had a stronger flavour.

Final thoughts:
We treated ourselves with a brunch at Eggspectation and in turn was treated to a great first experience. We're now both fans and definitely have this place on our lists to bring other friends."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Food poisoning!! Do not go there !!

Been to this place few times, but Sunday July 9th is worst I've had around Toronto for brunch. First of all, our food was late. The table next to us came later than us got their food first. When they almost finished their plates we are still waiting for ours. The waiter was not even acknowledging they are behind or something has gone wrong on the order. When our food came, my friends' plates looked fine, but mine looked like it's been sitting at the ordering window for 10 minutes. Everything looked saggy and not pleasant. Not to the standards at all. After came home, my day was just between the bed and bathroom. Do not recommend at all. Below average service and the food just crap."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast one of the days we were here! Fast and immediate service. Never had to ask them for anything, they were very prompt. Only issue was that the staff wound argue and snap at one another which was a little annoying to consistently hear but all
In all id go back again!"}
{"text":"We dined here twice while on a 4 say trip. There is seating indoors and outdoors for your preference. The food was phenomenal. Plenty of choices from omelette to eggs benedict and everything in between. Spot was clean and service was on point."}
{"text":"Awesome food and exceptional service, who could ask for more!! Came on Sunday around noon with my boys and they hostess served us right away. Gave us w cozy booth and crayons for the kids. Delicious food was servers quick. The portion for the kids menu was amazing that I couldn't believe it was off the kids menu! I had the Eggstravaganza, fluffy like a cloud brioche French toast, two eggs, sausages and their one of a kind Lyonnaise potatoes that are perfectly seasoned and baked to perfection....so tasty! Loved it and definitely a returning customer!"}
{"text":"Went here twice on our vacation to Canada. The food was really good. The first time there were bugs on my husbands fruit but sometimes that's hard to avoid considering fruit is from nature. 
They took the plate and replaced it and it was a good meal with an awesome waiter."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. For the price point, it isn't much more delicious than Cora's, and portions are smaller but definitely still very filling. Wouldn't mind going again but if I was on a budget I would consider Cora's instead."}
{"text":"Delicious! great upscale breakfast/lunch/dinner place. Visited Montreal 3 times and have been there all three times. 
Their flambé dishes are out of this world."}
{"text":"Top quality breakfast place. Came in at 7 am, served quickly, food was out of this world, we paid by 7:30 am. Great service too."}
{"text":"Starting our last day in Montreal, we wanted something quick but delicious so we could start our adventuring early.  We've come across several Eggspectations during our trip and they were always bustling with crowds by the hostess so we figure we'll discover what all the excitement was about.

We were only a party of two, and because of that we were seated within five minutes of waiting in line.  I felt bad for the larger parties because who knows how long they've been waiting.  Who cares when I'm seated and have such an enticing menu in front of me.  I chose to go with the chicken benedict and my girlfriend had the \"Eggsuberant.\"  The chicken was tender and soft with a perfect hint of charred flavor and the poached eggs were done expertly.  It was heavenly when I pop them and the yolk mixed with the smooth, well seasoned hollandaise sauce.  And let me tell you, my go to for a breakfast side is usually home fries but more breakfast places should consider adopting Lyonnaise-style potatoes.

The decor is trendy with a modern, relaxed feel perfect for a Sunday morning even with the brunch bustle.  The staff was friendly but sometimes couldn't be found for long stretches.  It's understandable with the rush of patrons and it wouldn't have been an issue if we weren't looking to start our day early.

Having a name like Eggspectation, this place had better be able to deliver and deliver it does.  Possibly one of the reasons why I envy Canada over the United States, but this franchise truly raises the bar for breakfast.  IHOP, take notes because once there stood a Dunkin Donuts where now stands a Tim Horton is all I'm saying."}
{"text":"If I could rate it 6 stars I would! Really cool atmosphere and the food is seriously impressive."}
{"text":"The food here was great. We were seated quickly. However we noticed that the other customers were given a complimentary bread basket. Our waiter seemed to have forgotten our bread. Unfortunately, we realized this after we left the restaurant. We were surprised that our waiter forgot to do a simple task."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Eggs were spectacular and so was the French toast. Fruit was very fresh. Service was super nice and attentive. Great food at a great price, considering the area is pretty touristy. Highly recommend this spot if you're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Great food. Try the \"Yolks around the clock\" if you like bagels, bacon and cheese. I was here for 1 week and tried new places everyday for breakfast, by far the best. 

Update: This is day 2 and decided to try the breakfast crepes, super delicious and decadent. Portion size is large and flavors are great! They're paired with a nice spring salad with a delicious vinaigrette. Nice and light."}
{"text":"Solid hearty breakfasts.  A touch pricey, but had free wifi."}
{"text":"came for weekday lunch, restaurant was not busy at all. We got seated right away and there were a lot of empty tables.we ordered lobster benny and montreal styled benny, both were excellent! Service was fairly quick. i personally had the lobster benny and I loved it. reasonable amount of lobster meat.

it was a sunny beautiful day, should have taken the patio seats!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice for a weekend brunch with family and friends. Near the eaton center - excellent location to do some shopping afterwards to walk off the calories. Food is decent but a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Great food.  Good service but not that fast due to demand. Clean but not a charming atmosphere due to it being a chain.  It is like Montreal's version of the love child of America's Macaroni Grill and IHOP.  I would go again."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto for a visit to the Hockey Hall of Fame and wanted a great spot for breakfast beforehand. Eggspectation was perfect. We were able to park inside the garage at the Bell Monility Centre where Eggspectation is located, enjoy breakfast and then take a relatively short walk through downtown Toronto to the HHOF (less than 10 min walk). 

The vibe inside is trendy and cool and they had a low techno beat playing on the speakers. Our servers were quick to greet us and get us some drinks and our food arrived quickly. 

Frankly the part that took the longest was deciding what to order. If you're in a place like this, skip the standard breakfast stuff like omlettes and skillets and try some of their more unusual items. We had an excellent s'mores French toast made with Nutella, marshmallow, brioche bread, sliced bananas and strawberries drizzled with chocolate sauce and Canadian maple syrup. Yum!

Someone in our group also had a heavenly eggs Benedict with chicken breast which was great as well. Rounding out our order was a standard order of brioche French toast with fruit on the side and a \"Benedict with Benefits\" which is a healthy take on a traditional Eggs Benedict.

Everything tasted delicious and fresh. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Frequent visitor to this spot because it is close by and it offers a large variety of brunch options. Nice atmosphere, good people and all. Love it but have one thing that I have to warn people!

1) The potatoes eggspectation serve are not crispy enough. In fact, not crispy at all. It's like a failed hybrid between French fries and home fries. 

4.5 forever because of sad potatoes :'("}
{"text":"Spent the morning in toronto and couldn't be better then heading to this yummy establishment ! Orginal eggs Benny with an Americono coffee and added expresso shot!  17.00 all up. (Not cheapest around but given location, service and cleanliness is outstanding)

Apprently this establishment won best brunch in the city in 2014.

My server was Bennet who was always right there just when I needed something.

Very open concept dinning with what looked to be a coffee bar and or station to sit at. The menu is large and very informative. This location even offers hamburgers in the afternoons but closes at I belive 4pm each day.


Pros - location to eat ions center and bay street

Cons - a bit tricky to find, homeless on the walkways,"}
{"text":"I don't know if food was good or not. Left before we could eat. It simply was not a good experience. The service was slow and perhaps uncaring. Had issues with coffee and poor timing of toast being served prematurely prior to breakfast arrival. 15 min after toasts arrived, eggs came. I don't like eating cold toast. After asking them to be retuned they server refused. We left... Nobody from management took time to talk with us. I guess business must be good. 

I'm sure it's a fine place. Just had a bad experience."}
{"text":"When we first arrived there was a long line and we debated leaving, but we decided to wait. They handled the line pretty well and the waitstaff was really great. The food was fantastic and came out very quickly."}
{"text":"One thing that totally ruined the experience for me (and I'm not sure if this is exclusive to this location or even to this restaurant... I will pay attention next time I'm elsewhere) but the servers making the toast is completely disgusting imho. 
The same servers who take your money, give you change, clear your dirty dishes and utensils, pick up napkins off the floor Etc., are then removing your bread from bags, sticking it into the toaster, buttering it, laying entire hand on it while slicing in half, then putting into baskets. You may as well be licking their fingers directly after they've cleared the table near you. 

Maybe it's just me and most people wouldn't be totally turned off by this, but this is more than enough to keep me away for good. I know people will say there's a lot that goes on in kitchens that we don't see. But the fact that I do see this, is appalling. 

You likely wouldn't want someone at a donut shop handling your donut holes with their bare hands, or a sandwich shop employee making your food without gloves, so why is Eggspectation blatantly ignoring this hygiene standard every single day?

I will never return.

(Don't be fooled by the hand sanitizer installed at the toasting station. I did not see a single server use it. But anyhow, who really wants Purel on their toast anyhow?)"}
{"text":"I ate here while visiting Toronto. Eggs Benedict was outstanding, hash browns are excellent. All of the food ordered at our table was well-enjoyed. The service was friendly and quick. The ONE downside was the coffee. I ordered an Americano and it was not very good."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Food tastes great, lots of variety. Friendly service and ambiance.
Wish they had one back home."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic breakfast. I've been on a worldwide search for the best Eggs Benedict. This is the place. Exceeds eggspectations!"}
{"text":"We went there with a couple of friends for Brunch. My experience was simply amazing, the food was fabulous and staff were friendly and fast (in English and French)."}
{"text":"I thought this place was excellent.  I read some reviews and I was on the fence as to coming here.  However, it was good.  When we walked up I figured it had to be good or it wouldn't be crowded.  I just had eggs and a Belgian waffle with bananas.  Nothing fancy.  The food was good.  The service was as fast as it needed to be; based on the number of people that needed to be attended to.  If anything, I liked that fact that our server wasn't bothering us every five minutes or trying to get us out of there.  Nice and affordable for a visit.  I would've given it five stars.  However, most of their breakfast meat choices were pork; vice an alternative like turkey bacon or sausage.  Will be back again since they do dinner as well."}
{"text":"The food is just average. You can probably do better in your own town.
Had their usual special and orange juice. 
 
This place didn't reach up to my \"eggspectations\"  For the price, I rather have lunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! They have a huge menu with breakfast, brunch and eggs in every form possible. Fun setting with wonderful customer service. Highly recommended!! Great breakfast destination"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Wesnesday. The hostess was not very nice or welcoming. When we got our waiter, he was very impatient, no manners and barely even looked at us. It seems that he would take him too much effort to even provides us with a smile or talk to us. One of the worst service I had in a restaurant! When the food arrived, after 25 minutes (for eggs and a sandwich) the omelette was not completely cooked, in fact it was semi-liquid for the white part and the tuna panini sandwich was in fact a baguette, that was not good. The lyonnaise potatoes tasted like frozen potatoes, they were not fresh. To end this ''beautiful'' experience, the waiter completetly ignored us while paying and ignored when we said thanks to him. So rude! We even noticed that people from the other tables did not eat more than half of their plates. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Awesome!! I went here for breakfast with my fiancé during the Christmas holidays, we waited just a few minutes to have a seat. The service was really fast and the food was amazing!! I got the best hand-squeeze juice ever (green light) and the pancakes pagè were good with A LOT of fresh fruits! I finally loved this place."}
{"text":"Unique combination of eggs and meat, sweet and savory. I would make the 4 hour drive to Toronto eat here again! Everything here tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Classic and the Montrealer. Sad to say for the price we paid, it just wasn't worth it.  Our portion sizes were very small and the sunny side up eggs that I ordered were already punctured and runny. The 2 pieces of fruit (slice of cantaloupe and an orange) were pathetically small and dry (yes dry). Wouldn't go back here again. Mediocre and overpriced. Management needs some form of quality control over the food coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"If you get tired of paying a fortune for breakfast and trying to find one that serves something your kids would like, try this restaurant.  Pretty straight forward American-styled egg based diner.

Not a Montreal restaurant experience, but value for money and a break from your Montreal food quest."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch and it was worth every penny!

We tried to call to make reservations, but they do not take reservations for tables of 2 on weekends. However, even though the place was packed when we arrived around 12:30pm, we were seated within a 15 minutes.

- Ambiance = 5/5...the decor and music was very hipster & rustic
- Service = 5/5...everyone from the hostesses to the servers were friendly and informative
- Food = 5/5...we ordered the Smoked Salmon Benny and the French Toast Page to share and we devoured them both within a few minutes!!  The smoked salmon benny was just perfect...it was on a whole grain piece of toast so it felt extra healthy. The French Toast Page was wonderful as well; the maple syrup was a bit sweet, but the English cream was absolutely heavenly. Both plates had a generous portion of fruits on the side as well!
- Drinks = 4/5...we ordered the Hot Chocolate and the Cafe Au Lait. The presentation was very nice, but the drinks were all right...nothing amazing, but at least they didn't cost an arm and a leg, like most brunch places charge :)

Definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves brunch!  I'm looking forward to trying their omelettes next time!

Edit: we had a slightly hard time trying to find this place when we came out of the Eaton Centre because it's not right AT the corner of Albert & James, you need to walk a little bit West on Albert Street to see it. Hope that helps!"}
{"text":"I recently attended a conference in Toronto and I was so happy to find this place. I ate breakfast here 4 days in a row. The food and service was consistently great. I had a different kind of Eggs Benedict each morning with coffee. The serving size is hearty and filling."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a nice quaint neighborhood feel. The fruit was extremely fresh, the eggs benedict were good. The pancakes were delicious. The only thing I would change was the service. Our waiter was not attentive at all, we had to keep asking others who work there for assistance. Still worth a visit though."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast spot. Great decor in a very clean space. I had the waffle bacon Benedict w fresh OJ. I'll be back again if I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"Ordered the brioche French toast. It was delicious, but it came drenched in syrup. Definitely WAY too sweet for me, and I'm saying that as someone with a sweet tooth. Also, I didn't like how the fruit that came on it was cooked or something, so it seemed soggy not fresh (even though it probably was fresh and it was just like that because of how they prepared it). Would not recommend this dish, but the restaurant's atmosphere was nice and I'd certainly come back here to try something different!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to's downtown. Plenty of seating and food that's a great balance of portion and quality. The selection is quite varied, which you don't find everywhere."}
{"text":"I expected this place to be a little bit better from the things I've heard about it but for me (or the meal I chose) it wasn't all that great. 

The selection they have is rather expansive. They have a copious amount of egg options, burgers for the extra hungry, and waffles/pancakes for your sweet tooth. I opted for the Eggs Florentine which comes with grilled potatoes and fruit. It took a bit of a while for my meal to come. It's brunch on the weekend - I understand. But anyone that loves poached eggs inherently understands the immense satisfaction when you cut right down the middle of it and this vibrant yellowy orange yolky liquid gold oozes out. This didn't happen for me. My eggs had hardened and the yolk oozed out - or should I say hesitantly inched out - very anticlimactically. The English muffin aka piece of cardboard it was on was tough to cut through and the hollandaise sauce was way too salty for my liking. The disk of potatoes that came with my order tasted really grainy and left a powdery kind of taste in my mouth. And nothing was wrong with the fruit (pineapple, watermelon, and a grapefruit slice) because you can't really mess that up."}
{"text":"Came on a weekday and though it was clearly busy the hostess had us seated in a cosy booth within 3 minutes. Service was eggceptional  and prompt but not rushed. I highly recommend ordering Eggsuberant as it contains all the same marveloussness as the high rise pancakes - but you'll actually be able to finish it! 

Great spot for brunch and to catchup with a friend before hitting the shops at Eatons!"}
{"text":"This place had delicious food and the waitress was very friendly. 
I ordered the French toast and it was out of this world."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant three days in a row, which should already be a pretty clear indicator as to how much I loved this restaurant. My favorite dishes in particular were the chocolate chip pancakes and the waffles pagé. Both were incredibly satisfying, and this is coming from a new yorker. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great service.   Lobster Benedict was amazing.  My new favorite place for breakfast when downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"After reading lots of positive review, I decided to come to this place for brunch.
Went there on Saturday around 1pm, the place was full of people super crowded. So join in the waitlist online before you go.
I had cheddar mushroom omelette with potato, nothing special, the fruit on the side was not fresh enough, definitely already chopped long time before it came to my table. Also, the omelette itself was not flavorful, oily for me. I ended up could not finish it. 
my friend had traditional mac cheese, not cheesy enough, but also super oily as well. The bread on the side loaded with huge amount of plain melted butter on the top."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal for a weekend, we asked our hotel what's a good french breakfast place to eat at. They recommended Eggspectations and told us it was really good. They didn't recommend any other places (a little suspicious).
We went to the place and first off the seating is really close. You can hear everything from the tables beside you.
The breakfast wasn't anything great, but if you love eggs you have a lot of options.
The bacon wasn't cooked too well and the coffee tasted worse than Tim Horton's.
The service was also really slow (We went on a Saturday morning around 10am).
Personally, next time I'll do a little more research on my own and find a better place, but if you're looking for a simple north american breakfast place similar to Denny's then this is your place!"}
{"text":"Stopped here with a friend before returning to New Jersey. It definitely hit the spot. Great great food. I got the Eggstravaganza and he got the eggs benedict. He seemed pleased with his meal and I was with mine for sure. The orange juice was delicious but it's freshly squeezed so if your not a fan of pulp let them know. I had two sunny side up eggs on two pieces of French toast with potatoes and fresh fruit. The syrup was also the best I've ever had. I would definitely go back to this place or one of their different locations as well."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  They have these places in Toronto, too and they're great.  Their benedict had a really potent guyere hollandaise which was really nice to taste a little twist in the ol' recipe - to my knowledge.  Definitely go there if you're hankering for breakfast - Chez Cora is pretty close to this place too and it's just as good."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and brunch place! Great ambiance suited for everyone! Their plates are big and super filling. Almost everything on the menu is delicious especially the pancakes and the eggs."}
{"text":"I'd say this is more a 3.5, but I'd round up to a four. The food was quite enjoyable, but for the helpings and size, it was overpriced. Still, if you're looking for a high quality, filling breakfast and don't mind spending a bit more, this is a great place."}
{"text":"Another great breakfast menu in Montreal with delicious, high-quality large portions. Unfortunately we were in the middle of the lunch rush, resulting in a crowded and frenetic experience. I'd recommend this spot, but the food isn't necessarily worth compromising the overall experience during a busy period."}
{"text":"I ordered egg omelette with Swiss cheese and some pancake.
Unfortunately, the omelette was okay because the cheese was not melted.
And pancakes I ordered were a bit under-cook.....
But, fresh orange juice and their espresso was great.
Also, their service was fairly good too although we mentioned about the pancakes.

FYI, I have been here a couple years ago and  I truly enjoyed the meal last time so I came back here to enjoy a branch again. 
I will probably try Egg Benedict again if I have chance to go back."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday morning, and I'm glad I opted to waitlist through Yelp as compared to waiting in line without reservation, as it was really crowded. My experience was pretty great- I went with two friends and we all enjoyed our dishes: Blackstone Eggs (eggs benny), Eggspection Omelette with fruit on the side, and nutella, walnut banana pancakes! I highly recommend getting the orange juice. My friends enjoyed their green light smoothie and cafe au lait.

One slightly unpleasant experience was getting seated. Despite the server at the front telling us we would be the next to be seated, or \"less than 10 minutes\", we kept seeing people getting seated before us and it took longer than 20 minutes. 

But overall, it was great!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing!!! How did i find it??? Thank you Siri!!! Friendly staff and fast service.. Our food came out immediately! I asked for best Brunch places in my area and this was the first listing Siri provided me with and of course after seeing 100 and something comments we decided to go here! One word .. AMAZEBALLS!!!! We are here in Toronto for my sisters birthday weekend so far so good! I will post on other places we plan to visit!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place around the corner from our hotel. We ended up eating there twice during our five-day trip. The food was very good, the service was great, and it was a nice place to be, too."}
{"text":"Delicious options.  The best was the mexican omelette with avocados.  The Montreal bagel was also great.  Visited this place twice during a 4 day business trip.  If you are hungry then this is the place to visit.  Service was quick and efficient"}
{"text":"Great Food and Great service!!! However overpriced drinks (tea and coffee)."}
{"text":"This place was great! Our waiter was super helpful even showed us how to use the metro!! The menu was a bit pricey but everything was related to an egg pun (funny)! Food was hot and quick and the place had a good atmosphere and free wifi. Again our waiter was superb! I wish all places had someone as friendly and knowledgeable as him! 
It was everything we egg-spected and more!"}
{"text":"There was long line for Sunday brunch. We were promptly seated at the bar. The prices were reasonable, food was tasty , and service was pleasant. I don't often go out to brunch but I would definitely return to this place. I ordered a mimosa and French toast with a sunny side up egg on the side. I finished my plate clean. Great way to end my trip in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best omelettes ever, especially the caper and smoked salmon one! Staff not always the friendliest though."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Ritz and wanted a nice breakfast. We really enjoyed our experience. Overall we had  good service and the food was very good. I had perfectly cooked eggs and my SO  had French toast. The prices were pretty reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place downtown, a little touristy, but that's expected for the area of town. I ordered the Benedict with Benefits, and it was absolutely delicious! Will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I ordered Bagel eggspectation which was mediocre and Smoked salmon eggs benedict which was just awful. We weren't asked how we wanted the eggs cooked and it just came really runny and mushy. Yolk was hardly cooked and way too runny which made the entire dish super messy. Hollandaise sauce had no flavor and tasted like yellow cream, GROSS! For something that was called Smoked salmon eggs benny, there were hardly any smoked salmon on top. It was done horribly and it lacked quality and taste. I would never order this again yet alone come back here.

I actually had longer review for this restaurant but it got removed because apparently I used content from other source.....ummm you mean my own blog? that I alone write? I don't know why restaurants can't seem to accept honest criticism and just deal with it. Not everyone will love your restaurant, there might be bad reviews time to time....just accept it!!!! I will never ever eat here again nor will I ever suggest it to anyone I know."}
{"text":"I didn't know eggs could be made in soo many varieties. For me an egg is just a shell with a yolk in it, so that's why I was really surprised with the menu. It took me about 15 mins to decide what I wanted to order. I usually tend to order coffee at the end but I changed my mind and ordered the cappuccino instead. Unfortunately, it wasn't great, I was expecting it to be better. 

My friends and I ordered the Meat lovers omelette, Rosemary chicken sandwich, sweet delight crepe, Lobster mac and cheese, Strawberry blonde and last but not the least, I got myself the Lobster Omelette. 

We were happy with what we ordered, especially the Lobster Omelette. I think out of everything we ordered the Lobster Omelette stood out, because of its flavour and taste. On the other hand, the Lobster mac n cheese was very bland and I couldn't really taste the lobster.

I loved the service, the server was prompt and friendly. 

I would definitely come back for the Lobster Omelette."}
{"text":"Full stars for this place for its breakfast.
Great service and even better food.
Wonderful decor. 
It will cost just a few dollars more but in return you will get what you pay for. 
Super clean and great food . See pictures of what we had.

DONT GET THIS PLACE MIXED UP WITH THAT CHAIN. That chain is only one star at its best."}
{"text":"This place is originally from Montreal which was where I first tried Eggspectation (the one located at the end of rue de la Montage). The franchise in Toronto is waaay bigger (though I think the Montreal branch has better food). It's just as crowded but the wait isn't usually more than 20 mins. I always order the eggs florentine (eggs benedict) which is the perfect size and I enjoy the Lynonnaise potatoes with real maple syrup. The lattes are also good. Service is brisk which is just the way I like it."}
{"text":"I am not a lover of chain restaurants.  One of the things that amuses and infuriates me is when people extoll the virtues of one outpost of a given chain over another.  In the spirit of recently acquired humility, I have to publicly state that for whatever reason, Eggspectations in Quebec are far superior to their counterparts in Ontario.  

I was in Montreal with a group and when the majority voted for Eggspectations I cheerfully acquiesced (sulked the whole walk over).  We were promptly seated outdoors and coffee/juice orders were taken almost immediately.  Although I wanted an americano, I ordered a latte as the milk tends to hide less than stellar coffee.  It arrived promptly and was --pretty decent.  The fresh OJ was really nice as well.   The server (having correctly sized me up) steered me towards one of the specials - a Montreal smoked meat benedict served over a real Montreal bagel.  It was damn tasty and everything was served just as I had requested.  The service was a bit slow, although with the major crowd circling out front I felt this was a reasonable compromise.

Since everyone agreed that they had eggsceded our eggspectations (yes. I had to...) we decided to catch up there for breakfast the next day.  

Almost walked out front to make sure we were in the same restaurant.  Although far less crowded, the service was s-l-o-w, almost every order was delivered with a serious flaw (friend ordered eggs benny, ended up with a crab cake underneath the egg - he's allergic)  The juice may have been fresh squeezed, but not in recent memory. The bagels were frozen in the centre.  What happened?  I discretely approached the manager and described the problems of the day in light of our stellar experience the day before.  He was very apologetic and sought to rectify all of the wrongs immediately.  

I'm forced to offer a 3 star rating as a bit of moving target.  This place is obviously capable of serving an excellent breakfast, your mileage, however, may vary."}
{"text":"Awesome place for brunch and a great family atmosphere! We had a large party and they were able to accommodate us on such short notice. It's so close to Eaton Centre (where we were shopping) and were baby friendly (such a plus!) 

I had the Sunrise Scramble and it was sooo delicious and was such a huge portion! Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"After looking at their menu online, I had high expectations (no pun intended) but I was somewhat disappointed. I went there with my brother and mom, his bloody Mary lacked even the slightest hint of alcohol, my eggs benediction had cold hollandaise sauce, and the fresh fruit was not too fresh. Overall it was an okay meal but for their prices I expect better than that. I will say their sausages were amazing, we had good service, and I really liked the decor. But I don't think we'll be going back.."}
{"text":"Super fast service and clean bathrooms. Food was amazing, server was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"#summerlicious 2017
Being a huge brunch fan, eggspectation was my first stop for Summerlicious this year. I arrived at around 11am, the place already started to fill. I was lucky enough to find a spot on the patio. The weather was great: not too hot, not too cold, no rain and no direct sunlight either. I got 3-course lunch for $18, coffee on the side.
Appetizer - Honey Apple Walnut Crostini (6.0/5.0) Yes, it was THAT good!!!! The apple, the brie, the bread, the walnut, the honey -- everything tied in together so perfectly, each bringing in their own layer of flavor and texture. It was an amazing tasting experience, I enjoyed every bite thoroughly. This appetizer was definitely the highlight of the meal, and (frankly) the only item I would gladly come back for.
Main - Salmon Potato Benedict (3.5/5.0) Usually I'm a fan of egg bennies, and this one wasn't MUCH of a disappointment. Instead of english muffin it was served on potatoes, unfortunately they ran out of gratin potatoes and had to give me regular ones, which is probably why it tasted so dry and out of place. The eggs were undercooked -- egg whites were still runny and no one asked me how I wanted it done!! The hollandaise sauce was decent enough, and the combination with smoked salmon had good flavor, so I ended up clearing the plate anyway. But Cora's definitely has better egg bennies, and way more consistent in quality.
Dessert - Stawberry Blond Crepe (-2.0/5.0): yes, it was THAT bad. I took one bite, one bite, and I had to spit it out. The flavor totally gave me a brain freeze, I don't know WHAT it was except that I really hated it. It's probably a love it/hate it kind of thing, would not recommend trying unless you already know what it tastes like. 
Coffee(1.0/5.0) Bland, watery, hardly even tasted like coffee...It was so bad I didn't even want refills. I mean seriously, what breakfast diner screws up coffee?? I've had better at Starbucks, had better at McDonald's, and definitely had better at Cora's. If you're planning to eat here, get your coffee from McDoald's down the street -- at least the big M's never disappoint:/
Overall the food was okay. The apple walnut costini is a must try, the rest I can live without. Coffee and dessert was just...gah. The background music and the atmosphere was extremely pleasant though, so I would give the whole dining experience 4 stars."}
{"text":"Don't let the cheesy name turn you away! This place is magical - from the lovely mimosas, to the great decor, and DELICIOUS food - this is pretty great.

I had the lobster benedict and the lavender mimosa(s) - oh man, I was a happy and full camper. We came here with the brother and his family, including a well behaved 1 year old - and we all came away with a great experience.

The service was a solid 3, but the food, ambiance, and drinks totally make this a solid brunch/breakfast place in the area."}
{"text":"I'm sure all the lovely carnivores out there (like my husband) will love Eggspectation. But I think it is overpriced and not vegan friendly at all.

So 1 star for the 'nice' decor and service and another for the 2 sides of potatoes I had for brunch."}
{"text":"Good food overall, due to proximity this was an obvious breakfast choice, what I have a problem
with was, twice they fail to say they didn't have certain items in the menu, important one like say PANCACKE mix! Then it messes your choice up, but you've already had coffee so you have not much of a choice if you're running in a tight schedule."}
{"text":"Pretty much exactly what you would eggspect from a chain breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"Very pleased with all the dishes we ordered.  Food fash tastefull and fresh as well as the orange juice.    Service was great and fast."}
{"text":"A great place eat and start your day!!! The service is good! The food delicious!
They have plenty of options an  you can choose low fat dishes (with extra fee). The attention was super nice, about the atmosphere it's pretty chill and warm. I don't know if it's \"cheap\" or not but I'm sure you'll enjoy it!!
I almost forgot about potatoes!!! Yummy yumm!!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. I had the eggchilada and he egg was fluffy and he cheeses were good. There was enough spice to know it's there but not overpowering. 

My Wife had the French toast. And it was also very good. The fresh squeezed OJ was perfect

The wait staff friendly and easy to get along with. Especially since we do not speak French. Will definitely repeat"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a weekday and the place was pretty empty. Despite the fact that it was empty, our service was a bit slow. (However, our server was very nice) The menu is huge! We both got big egg platters, which were pretty good as far as breakfast food goes. The prices were also very reasonable. We mostly chose this place because we wanted a breakfast close to our hotel in the late morning, which is what we found."}
{"text":"A definite five star breakfast. I ate the Montreal style meal, two eggs, Canadian styled bacon, potatoes Lyonaise, fresh fruit slices, toast etc. latte coffee. Everything hot and service well executed. Restaurant was filled the whole time. Saw lots of delicious looking plates and drinks. Would go again most assuredly."}
{"text":"They give you a little packet of peanut butter with your toast!!! Just go its the best! #CanadianCowgirlApproved"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food was exceptional, as well as the service I received. Im from NY so brunch is what we do lol and I was very impressed. I had an omelette and my friend had the french toast. Lets say I know where Ill be eating next time. I think this was an all over great place to eat for families, young ppl. Prices were decent, great selection of food/beverage options, and the outdoor sitting was lovely."}
{"text":"If you're going to boast awesome hollandaise, please:

A) make it in house
B) don't run out of it 

I dined at this location twice while here. The first time everything was great. Food came in a timely fashion, it was delicious and a generous portion, didn't make it through all my lyonnaise potatoes... took us 45 mins to get a seat but I'm not about to complain that a restaurant is busy. Service was friendly and the smoothies were damn delicious too! 

Then, I decided to return 2 days later. 

This time, we waited only 10 minutes for a table. We were seated and then waited about 10 more minutes to be greeted by a server (Zach, really nice guy and friendly server!) - when we asked for our Benny's, we were promptly told that there was no more Hollandaise sauce. 

\"WHAT??!!\"

Alas, shit happens. So we told Zach to grab our drinks (highly recommend the Banana Java smoothie) and we'll pick something else. When he returned, I tried to order the famous Bagel Sandwich with classic Montreal Style bagels... before I can finish my re-order, Zach tells me:

\"We're all out of bagels.\"

At that point I was so hangry and annoyed that we just asked for some Bruschetta and our bill. To their credit, the Bruschetta was tasty. The service was also good and the drinks were great. The reason I'm leaving a 2 star rating is because Zach revealed something interesting to us when he mentioned they were 86-Hollandaise.  

Apparently they don't make their hollandaise sauce in house. They make it in Montreal and send it to their restaurants! How do you pack and ship Hollandaise??? What kinds of preservatives are in the sauce? What the... I've eaten eggs Benedict all around Canada and the Hollandaise is always made in-house... finding out that their Hollandaise is shipped from another province, in a bag, made me feel like I was eating at Denny's. 

Anyways, although things were tasty on my first visit, I was utterly disappointed on my second. The average of these two visits is 2/5. 

Thanks Zach, for the honest explanation and for doing your best to keep us smiling. Cheers."}
{"text":"This is a nice little gem downtown. I don't know literally anything about Downtown Montreal. But we are here for breakfast after we slept through our free Hyatt Regency breakfast right next door.   We sat on the balcony set up and it was a pleasant July day. The server was friendly and prompt. The pancakes were a tad dry and probably could have used a bit of butter, but the French Toast obviously was perfect! Eggs scrambled was light and fluffy. The potatoes were marvelous.  This is our first real day in Montreal and we will return here for breakfast.  I wish I could describe parking, but everyone says \"take the train\". Good solid service in French and English and good food for brunch. The menu has a wide variety of items."}
{"text":"Great location downtown near the Museum of Contemporary Art. We came here for brunch on a Saturday so it was pretty busy. I ordered the French toast which came with bananas, strawberries, walnuts, and an orange liqueur sauce. It was ahhhmazing!!! I would definitely recommend it and it's big enough to share! The service was friendly and quick. Even though it was busy we got our food pretty quickly. It also doesn't hurt that they have free wifi!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places n Toronto.  A nice casual place, dinner is also pretty good,

Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Looking for a good breakfast place while here on Vacation so glad to have found this place super yummy... me & 4 friends we ordered French toast great, pancakes good, bacon great, cheese toast great, potatoes GREAT, omelette good, waffles good, coffee good but not hot... very crowded and my waitress didn't seem to happy, wasn't too attentive, she was nice though Mariya...  I'll come back once more before I head back to CA..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it was but the morning I stopped in here I wasn't too hungry, I was just craving a crepe with Nutella.  This place is a little bit on the outskirts of Old Montreal which was nice because it wasn't crowded like all of the other places were on a nice weekend morning.  The wait staff was attentive and friendly and had no problem dealing with my obnoxious group of half English speaking, half French speaking friends.

I ordered my banana, Nutella crepe while most of the rest of the group got breakfast.  Everyone seemed happy with their meals.  One of my friends ordered Mac n Cheese which I tried and it was absolutely amazing.  I would definitely get that again if I went back.  Overall I would say my crepe was average.

I like the fact that it's walking distance from the hotel I normally stay at, it's not too crowded, and it has a very diverse menu, so I would probably return here again."}
{"text":"AWW YEAH! Make sure you get reservation. I used Yelp to get me on that list because the wait goes outside and its COLLLLDDD outside BRRRR

I had the Montreal Benny, and my husband got the Eggspectation Bagel Breakfast.

I have to say my husband won this one. LOL Hes was so good. The bagel and flavors were really good. 

The orange juice was freshly squeezed. 

The portions are huge

OH and the kids breakfast was a pretty big too."}
{"text":"The reviews from Yelp encouraged us to visit this great little spot with an extensive menu. I ordered the classic breakfast and my honey the breakfast that included poached eggs and pancakes. Both were OK. The pancakes seemed dry. The service was terrific. The highlight was the chocolate and banana crepe I ordered, delicious! The potatoes that are served with the breakfast dishes are divine, such a treat."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Good portion! Love the many breakfast selection! Atmosphere nice. But super super super busy!"}
{"text":"absolutely loved this place.  great atmosphere, exceptional service, outstanding food!  I had a zucchini omelet  with smoked salmon-  IT WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!

The price is right too!  LOVE IT"}
{"text":"A large open-space restuarant with cramped space makes for a hectic meal, but it was also lively and vibrant!  All kinds of age groups, families, couples, etc. filled the space and the open air kitchen added to the frenetic pace of the place.

We ordered an assortment of breakfast dishes, but I only tasted my own dish.  I ordered a traditional eggs Benedict  and it was cooked to perfection.  The Canadian version of hollandaise sauce is so rich and creamy, and theirs did not disappoint.  The dish was served with lyonnaise style potatoes which were also crisp and delicious.

A very satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for breakfast or brunch. The service was great and we completely cleaned our plates! Everything was so delicious and if I didn't live so far away, I would be eating here every weekend."}
{"text":"Had a page tropical juice. Was very tasty. Service here is prompt and courteous. Would eat again. The outdoor patio is a great spot."}
{"text":"Really good food. Watch out when changing and adding extras. I ended up paying 30$ for breakfast, ouch!"}
{"text":"Really impressed on my first visit.  
Great venue. Perfect energy. 
Great looking menu.  
Great looking plates.   
Great tasting food.  Wish I could eat more or come more often and try everything! 

Great service.  Perfect.   Glass of water delivered at the end of your meal - bonus marks, classy touch.  Never had to ask or look around for our server.  Coffee perfectly replenished exactly as needed. 

Great value.  It isn't cheap but it's really really fair value.  

And the kids loved it too.   

Just a great experience all around.  I wish there were more of them."}
{"text":"Loved my breakfast. Eggceptional. Great potatoes and ham with eggs. Brioche French toast. Exceptional waiter who gave us tips about getting around. Nice double cappuccino. Will go back"}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast or brunch, and really, every single dish on the menu has eggs. If you love eggs there is no other place better than this. There is a large list of pancakes, eggs benedict (several different ways), omelettes and just about anything else you can think of. The food was very good, though the service was a little slow. I got the large breakfast which included two eggs, ham, bacon etc. The reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that the toilets were gross. I know that they're busy, but just no excuse for dirty toilets. If you enjoy juices, they have a decent juice bar."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place downtown. For a chain I think it has some imaginative choices, and the quality was good. Its not a boutique with a small range of really unique offerings, its a chain with good quality."}
{"text":"It's a great brunch place but be prepared to wait for a table. It gets so busy during peak hours that there's no point of waiting. Besides that, food here is pretty good! I got the Eggs Benedict and their hollandaise sauce is bomb!"}
{"text":"Freshly made juice/smoothie. Various egg dishes, wonderfully designed restaurant.  Friendly staff.....it's all that a breakfast spot should be!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big egg person, but Eggspectation was the perfect place to refuel after a long day of shopping at the Eaton Centre. There was a wide selection of meals, many without egg. Also, the owner was SO nice! He came and talked with my friends and me and insisted on taking picture of us and then giving us a complimentary dessert. I remember getting an omelet and I remember it being delicious."}
{"text":"I rarely complain, but this restaurant is no where near 4 stars. I ordered a simple veggie omelet and it had no flavor and veggies used were clearly scraps, not freshly prepared. No flavor or seasoning and no cheese! I had to pay 2.75 extra to get cheese! Expected good toast, but not included. Two wedges of fruit were rock hard and not ripe. Regular coffee is really bland so ordered a large Latte.  Had to pay extra for a second shot of espresso which is included everywhere else. Lots of great breakfast choices in Toronto, don't waste an important meal here if you wish to start your day off right:-)"}
{"text":"Came here directly after arriving from the airport.

Ambiance: Spacious with a diner meets restaurant feel. The bathroom is downstairs and it feels a little sketchy because it faces an underground parking lot.  It feels like anyone can come and kill you and no one would hear you scream.

Service: Good

Food: They have a whole page on egg Benedict so it was on!  I had the California  Dreaming with bacon and their quinoa. It was so, so good! The boyfriend had the Montreal Benny and it was good as well, but I liked the California Dreaming better.

Would definitely return (but might skip the bathroom)!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch spot. We ordered several different things to share and they were all amazing. I like that it comes with fruits and salad. The home fries were very tasty. My favorite was the tropical salad. Fresh and sweet and healthy."}
{"text":"Great, whole food breakfast! Amazing smoothies. Wonderful vibe in the resturant and a really nice server!"}
{"text":"Eggspectation at 483 Bay St, Toronto, ON M5G 2C9, Canada is a great, classic to tastes and expectations location.  Eggspectation never disappoints, and this one certainly doesn't either.

Great food, Great drinks, and unmatched service!

The pancakes, waffles, benedicts, and other egg dishes are all excellent.  The mimosa isn't bad either.

If you're in the City Hall area, or a block or two from Dundas Square, definitely stop into Eggspectation at 483 Bay Street and enjoy!"}

{"text":"I didn't like this place.  I wanted to.  I love eggs.  But I didn't like this place.

It was a particularly busy morning.  My cappuccino took more than 25 mins to get.  The steak and eggs I ordered was just awful.  The steak was probably the worst steak I've ever had and I swear it didn't taste like beef.  It tasted pretty gamey.  And if it was beef, it couldn't have been fresh. 
A large portion of the mystery meat was just chewy fat.  And from someone who actually likes fatty steaks, this was just inedible. 
Even if I wanted to complain our waiter was nowhere to be found and our meal lasted nearly two hours.  The only redeeming thing about this were the smoked salmon and apple with walnuts croquettes which were great.  My friend ordered the actual steak and that tasted fine.  Wtf was I eating?"}

{"text":"This is my 2nd eggspectation experience and location. to be honest, it was good. not as good food as the other location, but this one had better service. the hollaindaise and egg were cooked perfectly and the salmon tasted great too. the size of potatoes i had didnt taste that great, in fact i felt they didnt have much flavor."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5. Was on vacation with the fam, I had been to Eggsclusif in Montreal, so thought Eggspectation would be just as good. The restaurant itself is very nice; inside and out. Food was good, though their potatoes weren't the best, IMO. Also, the service was mediocre. Our waiter wasn't very attentive. I had to get up to get salt, pepper and ketchup from another table, to which the manager apologized profusely. Coffe wasn't freshened up as quick as I'd like it. Everyone in my party enjoyed their meal, as did I, but the service is why I took off the half star, otherwise it would of been a 4."}
{"text":"Great breakfast items. I go here for freshly squeezed juice, fresh breakfast items. I love how all the breakfast comes with fruit. Also I love how it is a great value for your money. All items start at $10. Though they have a great side menu starting at $3. Also great large booths and wonderful atmosphere !"}
{"text":"Very good!  The yolk around the clock and smores french toast are must-haves.  Fruit was not completely ripe but most were out of season so they were still surprisingly good.  All around awesome!"}
{"text":"Eggspectation is a very nice option for breakfast or brunch.  

The dishes delivered up to our Eggspectations - sorry for that.  The pictures tell you all you need to know.  The food consists of fresh, healthy product professionally prepared.  The menu is not wildly creative or inventive, but it's exceptionally well executed.

Located next to the Eaton Center, they have spacious indoor seating and a sizable outdoor patio to take advantage of pleasant summer weather.  The ambiance is casual-upscale... you'd be comfortable in jeans or a suit.  The service was smooth and efficient.  

If I lived/worked in the neighborhood, this would quickly become a staple in my dining-out."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch or those times when you are craving breakfast anytime of day. They have quite an expansive menu with a variety of breakfast items that is sure to provide you with something to meet your fancy. 

Had brunch their a week ago on a Sunday at noon. The place was pretty packed and their was a wait for seating, but we were able to grab a spot at the small bar area to watch the British Open and enjoy brunch on the lone TV. 

In addition to the small bar area, the restaurant has seating on both a lower level and upper level, with additional adequate seating outdoors seasonally. 

The bartender was very friendly and took the time to talk to us and let us know what some of her personal favorite dishes were, amongst the hustle and bustle of fulfilling endless orders of bloody caesars, mimosas, fresh squeezed OJ & grapefruit juice, and the variety of fresh smoothies they make. In the time we were there, we probably saw about 25 smoothies being made.

The food was delicious when it finally came. I had an all American breakfast that had everything I could ask for to satisfy my breakfast crave. I also got a fruit cup as a side and it was probably the best fruit cup I have ever seen with a copious amount of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, bananas, melons, etc. 

I will certainly be back to eat here on return work trips to Montreal. 

I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could as I don't really have any complaints, but the only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is I feel their are some more unique atmospheres in the Old Port that can add to the brunch experience, especially in the summer on their outdoor terraces."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in Toronto. It's so good and they have such a big space to sit outside. I was disappointed they did not have any mimosa deals but oh well foods worth it"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Overall this place serves a good breakfast.  Not great, but good.  If you are a fan of eggs, this is the place to go since they have it made in all types of ways, served with all types of things.  I ordered bagel egg sandwiches and three scrambled eggs to go.  The sandwiches were good, served on a traditional Montreal-style bagel.  The scrambled eggs were a bit dry - some cream or butter would have been good.  However, my son still loved them.  The potatoes served with the bagel sandwich were good - a bit under-seasoned, but with ketchup they were fine.    

If we find ourselves in Montreal again, I'll probably be dining here again."}
{"text":"Okay fine so Eggspectation is a chain but it's GOOD! The menu is huge and diverse, and the prices are good. There's outdoor seating and inside is very cool too. I wasn't in the mood for eggs so I got the breakfast parfait and it was fantastic. My friend got the salmon benedict and enjoyed it very much as well.

Good service, good food, food menu, and an awesome location, chain or not it was worth stopping in for brunch."}
{"text":"Eggspectation's caffe latte: half a cup of coffee for the full price... (see my photo published)"}
{"text":"Eggspectation is a great place to get brunch or breakfast. The brunch portions are well-sized and they are mostly $15 and under. I had a Benedict that had perfectly cooked eggs and perfectly toasted English muffin. The potatoes that accompanied were great, too. Service is very good here as well."}
{"text":"Un petit dej du dimanche!

Service rapide, grand choix de repas dans le menu, dont plusieurs options moins classiques comme des ufs dans le trou (du bagel) gratiné. Pour ma part j'ai pris le bagel Montréal (saumon fumé, fromage à la crème, câpres et oignons rouges) assez bon, mais trop peu de saumon ! Le gros déjeuner du constructeur que mon homme a pris l'a repu, mais rien d'excitant de ce côté-là. Avis, ne prenez pas d'extras, ils sont a 2,50 la pièce et ça revient cher. Les smoothies n'étaient pas très bons surtout celui au café et bananes.

Ca fait la job on va dire !"}
{"text":"Came here because of the yelp reviews that we read. The Smore's French toast did not disappoint! The waiter that we had was very accommodating to our family and the food was excellent!  We also enjoyed watching the Boston marathon on the TV near our booth as we were visiting from Boston and had hoped to watch some of the race. We will be back if and when we come to town!"}
{"text":"Terrible, just terrible! 

After an early morning appointment, I became quite hungry and decided to stop by the nearest breakfast place I could find. Eggspectation was right in front of my face. Having been to other locations of the same restaurant, never would I have assumed to have such a terrible experience, and meal. 

Upon walking into the restaurant at 9:30am on a Monday morning, I was quite surprised to see that it was quite busy. Even more surprised after we left. I'll explain more as to why.
Our hostess had little to no manners, poor enthusiasm and bad attitude. I understand it's early in the morning and you may not want to be there, but it's your job! 
Upon directing us to our table(Table for two) the kitchen staff kept staring in a very ignorant way. Yes, I'm abnormally short in height, that gives you no reason to stare! Again, poor manners. 

Once we sat down right across from the kitchen, our waiter approached us. No hello, no good morning, no smile. Just the simple question of \"What would you like to eat?\" So, we politely answered with our order. By now, we wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. The only thing that kept us there was hunger. 

While waiting for our meal(20+mins for two dishes!) Scramble eggs with cheese and waffles with fruit. Which included \"real\" maple syrup.  We noticed the manager raising his voice and showing a great level of anger towards his kitchen staff. Very unprofessional to do such thing in front of your customers! 
At the same time, the same manager had to remind his staff which included our waiter to ask if we wanted toast? If we wanted coffee? Who doesn't want toast with their scramble eggs?!  Anywho.. Our meal finally arrived and it was lukewarm.. I was no longer in the mood to complain. I simply ate it with a smile. The fruit was unripened, taste it like a raw starchy potato. The waffles were warm and crispy, sadly it included a strong aftertaste of artificial vanilla flavour.  As for the maple syrup... It was NOT real. Real maple syrup does not taste light corn syrup with the thickness of corn syrup. Do not fool me by saying it's real and do not charge me $15.00 for a dish that is not worth more than $6.00. 
Eggspectations, please do your research on what REAL maple syrup is! If you cannot afford to serve it to your clients, do not promote it. As a foodie, I can surely taste the difference. Nice try in fooling me!
When it came time to pay, the debit/credit card machine gave you two choices for tip. 20% or 25% along with the choice of a dollar amount if you wished to do that. I cannot stand when others decide for me how much I should tip. 
 A tip is a reward for the having done a good job. I felt the job was poorly executed and deserved 10% out of kindness of mine, along with me never returning to this location again. 
I strongly suggest you to find any other place that will be far better than Eggspectation. Especially after paying $45 for two people."}
{"text":"My trip to Montreal was enhanced by eating breakfast here two days in a row. Late nights, overconsumption of spirits and lack of sleep were the recipe to prevent any daytime activities I had planned. A hearty, tasty, generously-sized breakfast was just what the doctor ordered and made me glad I didn't sleep in until 2pm. Great décor, attentive service and a more than adequate menu are reasons alone to return to this spot."}
{"text":"On vacation with the family in Montreal and we've eaten at other Eggspectation locations and enjoyed it.  This one didn't disappoint - we woke up late after getting in late the night before and missed breakfast.  Strolling in around 11 am, we were happy to see the hearty, big portions of brunch-friendly foods, even on a weekday.

The Crepes are very good - I had the ham, mushroom, and asparagus and my daughter had the grilled chicken, spinach, & mushroom - both were excellent and accompanied by a really nice roasted red pepper sauce (on the side).  All the other dishes at the table were great.

Service was also very friendly and attentive, despite there being many large groups that arrived about the same time we did.  

Unfortunately the coffee was absolutely HORRIBLE.  I ordered a double Americano (usually made with two shots of espresso, then some hot water.   It tasted like it was made from leftover grounds that had already been brewed three or four times.  There was no richness or deep coffee flavor one would expect from an espresso-based drink - only the faint hint of stale coffee grounds and cigarette butts diluted with hot water.  Blecch!  The only other downside was that the loud music playing was a mix of Justin Bieber and Kesha, which is incredibly annoying for those of us over the age of 10...

We'll definitely be back for the hearty brunch fare, but I'll be stopping at a cafe for my coffee before coming in (even the Starbucks across the street would be better!)."}
{"text":"Very great service, the interior is nice although slightly loud. The food was also great! The eggsuperbant wasn't really anything special and the pancake was a bit dry. But the eggspectacular crepe was great. Not quite sure if I got all the names right"}
{"text":"Man has this place gone downhill over the years. It use to be a sure fire breakfast hit. A bonanza of tastiness piled high on your plate. 

SOMETHING HAS CHANHGED. . . 

On a couple of recent visits the service has been poor, bordering on rude, the food terrible (the fruits that they use to decorate the plate with look like they were from last week) and over priced. There are tones of great breakfast places in Montreal and this is no longer one of them. 

Frankly I'd rather skip a meal than eat at Eggspectations again. 

Any hole in the wall diner will serve you a vastly superior breakfast for a small fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Went with a large group. Everyone was raving about the breakfast. Juices was freshly squeezed. A must go!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but the service was subpar. Of the 3 times I've been here, only once have I gotten my food in less than 45 minutes (one time it was comped since it took over an hour). Wait staff are friendly there just isn't enough of them."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The decor inside is nice and modern, the service is great and the menu selection offers everything that a person who loves brunch would want. The line ups here on the weekend are atrocious so I recommend lining up early or putting yourself in the waiting list via the Yelp app. 

The quality and portion sizes are good for the price. Will be back here frequently."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this location. The first visit was excellent from both a service and food point of view. 

This time it was a Sunday and I know this type of establishment can fill up so I called their number and the voice mail answered saying that they could not take my call and to leave a message (this was at 8 AM). I left my message advising that I would like a reservation at 12:30 PM and if there was a problem to call me. 

I arrived at the restaurant at the time. The attendant told me there was no reservation, she said her phone was not charged. I responded that is not my fault could we still get a table?

She said very rudely, \"We cannot seat you\" At which point I asked how long a wait and she ignored me and started speaking to the person who arrived after me and took their name and advised them of a 30 minute wait.

These folks will be another restaurant to close in this location with customer service like that. She wouldn't even both to check the voice mail to verify that indeed I left that message. 

I shall not return despite my previous pleasant experience.

{"text":"I'm giving this a 4Star for a place that has a lot of variety to meet many different tastes.  Was there for a wedding weekend so had to choose a breakfast place that accommodated all ages.  Great service, easy downtown location, friendly staff and great breakfast options."}
{"text":"Great brunch with a lot of options which could be a problem for some but also good for when you want to go back for more! I had the Eggstravaganza and it was awesome. The French toast, home fries and eggs were all good.

Also the yelp option to join the waitlist and see your progress was awesome!"}
{"text":"was walking around the eatons centre when we found this place to stop and have brunch at.
i got the eggs benny (waffles) and my friend got the lobster benny.

the ambience inside reminded me of a cute little cafe in NY it was nicely decorated and really busy too.


the only reason i dropped it to a 4/5 star rating is because i found a piece of egg shell in my benny and when i pointed it out to the server his response was that he couldn't see the shell i spoke of. i happily pointed it out to him, and they reduced my bill."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place, so I dragged my partner to here... 

Bravocaado EggBenny is what I ordered that day...I wanted a holland sauce but it was tomato sauce on a half cold avocado...double disappointing.

Overall taste was not bad, speed was fast. But the seating area has no privacy at all. Looks more like a high school open cafeteria...I can't stop listening what the girls next to us about their amazing Friday night went."}
{"text":"Ok... I hate to be a cynic, but I'm feeling the need to set the yelp record straight here. I don't want fellow Yelpers to be led horribly astray when visiting this fine food-lovers city of the north.

Whenever any friend of mine from New York asks me about places to check out in Montreal, i give them an extensive list of restaurants, bars and attractions to visit. Eggspectations has never been on that list (and it never will be). As i previously stated, Montreal attracts a lot of foodies, and it boasts an incredible number of top-tier restaurants for a city its size. You visit it to indulge in steak frites with a pat of butter on top, or artery-clogging smoked meat sandwiches, or freshly baked goods from french boulangeries, or copious amounts of beer/liquor (especially if an you're an American teenager). You do NOT travel to this city to eat brunch at what is basically Canada's answer to IHOP.

Its true, everyone I know from college and their mother (literally) has been here a million times, and why some of them continue to go back... well, lets just assume they're ignorant of all the glorious brunch places Montreal has to offer. The ones I know of are mostly in the Plateau and Outremont. Any local you ask in those two areas will tell you to go to Toi Moi et Cafe, or Santropol, or wait in the ridiculously long line at L'Avenue (but ohhhh man is it worth it). Even mediocre Place Milton, crammed with clueless university kids, blows this place outta the water.

So yeah, don't have high eggspectations when eating here. Its just another lousy chain, and you could most definitely cook better eggs AND home fries in your own kitchen. The only saving grace about this place is that it's better than Chez Cora. I'm not even gonna take the trouble to review THAT one. If Eggspectations is a glorified IHOP, Chez Cora is an overpriced Denny's.

-end tirade-"}
{"text":"Their French toast is delicious! I was so happy that I ordered it. I also ordered a fruit smoothie with orange, and pineapple if I'm not mistaken, also very delicious! Our waitress was kind and attentive. The potatoes were also so yummy! I would return next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I stop by for a late breakfast on a Friday. I had the eggspectation omelete and a tropical paradise juice.  The food was good and the juice was fresh. The service staff were nice and patient. The food came out quickly. I enjoyed the vibe and energy while sitting outside."}
{"text":"Eggcellent! It was up to my Eggspectations! This classic brunch place has everything you can offer from eggs, waffles, pancakes, granola and more. I love how there are many options with fruit as a side because I love fruit. I got the waffles with the mixed fruit the first time I came here and once again got the waffles (with strawberries instead) the second time I came here. I liked the waffles with the mixed fruit more because it came with maple syrup and a creme fraiche sauce which was delicious! I would recommend coming here if you want to come with a big group, family or friends! It's a pretty standard brunch restaurant. If you don't make a reservation, expect a 30 minute wait on the weekend around 11 and 12pm."}
{"text":"Good value, though basic and not up to the hype."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had the French toast, I had the 'crepes' which turned out to pancakes but they were so good I didn't even care. The toast and pancakes were both super fluffy with fresh flavorful fruit on top. And it wouldn't be complete without maple syrup. Coffee and syrup refills were promptly provided.

Friendly service in English and French. Extensive menu with options to suit all palates. We are going back for breakfast tomorrow before we leave Montreal.

Highly recommend as a breakfast/lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard brunch fare but I was really craving a waffle. I got the one with flambéed strawberries and bananas and I inhaled it. The place was absolutely packed but service was very prompt. I would recommend it if you aren't in the mood for anything unusual, just plain brunch."}
{"text":"I went there a couple of times for breakfast/brunch and I really enjoyed the service and the food. I tried to order something new each time I went and I liked everything I had so far. My favourite has the be the smoked salmon Benny and the tropical teaser smoothie! Yum! :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place. We are visiting Toronto for fun and staying at Marriott on bay street/dundas street. We tried this out of curiosity and fell in love with it. We are going back tomorrow.

I tried their smoked salmon benny and my wife tried something with a weird name but both items were awesome. My daughter (3 years old) also ordered from kids menu and ate most of her meal. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This must be the best of the best in Montreal for brunch. A friend and I recently went here on a Saturday morning. There was a bit of a wait, so we popped across the street to starbucks and got a coffee while we waited. The best part is that there is a huge lobby outside the restaurant so you can wait for your table in a nice heated building. 

The inside is a large open-air restaurant with two levels: a lower level and a balcony upper level. Our waiter was super nice. As out of towners, he humored us by telling us where the fun places to go at night were. The food itself was amazing. The omelette is an old classic, but they did a great job. My friend got poutine and she loved it. For dessert we treated ourself with the smore french toast which contains banana, strawberry, and chocolate. The pictures speak for themselves... Believe the hype, it was amazing.

This place is very reasonably priced and delicious. If you can tolerate a 15-30 minute wait on a weekend brunch day, then absolutely go for it. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So I just returned here, as I said I would to try something else on their menu. I brought along my brother and his friend for lunch. 

I had the Big Cheese with Gruyere with a mixed field green salad. I also added a sunny side up egg on top which was free to add to any burger. The salad was a standard house salad, nothing special. The burger was very good though, cooked properly and I love brioche buns.

My brother got the Lobster Mac and Cheese which was very cheesy and was a pretty big serving. He really enjoyed it and finished off the whole plate. He also said the toasted garlic crostinis were good. 

His friend ordered The Big Classic Burger with fries and he enjoyed his meal as well and commented that the fries were really good.

I'm sure I will find my way back here yet again."}
{"text":"Ordered The Classics: Eggstravaganza and Sugar Shack. Each $14.95. French toast was so light and fluffy. Crepes Bretonne on the more chewy side. Overall a solid breakfast with good service and bright layout. They have two separate menus for day and night."}
{"text":"A few months ago I would have given this place a 3/5 because it was decent..Nothing out of this world, but not terrible either...

We dropped by last weekend, and it seems like things have changed because not only was the menu new, but the food was horrendous. Tasteless, bad presentation, and stingy service..

I used to come here twice a year maybe, but will definitely not be coming back. So disappointing!"}
{"text":"Un très bon rapport qualité / quantité / prix. Le cadre est très agréable et on y ressort l'estomac blindé !"}
{"text":"My wife and I walked here from L'Hotel when they opened at 7am. The waitress was friendly and place is very clean. I ordered the smoked meat omelet and she ordered the French toast. 
The normal order is 3 pieces but my wife can't eat that much. She asked for only 2 pieces and they adjusted the price.. how cool is that.. all places should offer 1/2 portions.

The food and service was great and started off our morning perfectly."}
{"text":"I liked the ambiance and the decoration and it happened to be sunny while we were seated at the window enjoying the sunshine. So no complaints 
I took the classic eggs, sausage and potatoes. Standard and plenty. The bill makes sense, service is rather quick ( specially for a Sunday noon) and staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Fun cafe with some nice brunch options. Went there during my visit to Toronto and enjoyed the French toast with maple syrup. The ambiance was a bit lacking. There was a long wait, but I love that they used Yelps wait tracking system. We could see in real time how long our wait would be and how we were  progress through it."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best breakfast chain of restaurants that I have ever been to in my entire life.  The food here is unbelievable and the wait staff was super accommodating.  

First off, I love puns so I was intrigued by the name alone.  My friends and I were on vacation in Montreal and we needed to find a breakfast place.  We were walking around and we saw eggspectations and decided to go in there.  

IT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER.  I got eggs with toast and bacon / sausage plus fruit and home fries.  It wasn't a complicated meal, but oh my goodness the flavors were outstanding!  These sunnyside eggs were just so rich and thick and gooey and delicious.  The bacon was crispy but chewy, but not super greasy.  The sausage was juicy, but again, not greasy somehow.  No idea what was going on there.  The home fries were amazingly tasty with a little bit of salt and a savory taste BUT AGAIN THEY WEREN'T DRIPPING IN OIL.  I actually asked for more toast to wipe up all the eggs.  I'm someone who usually blinks and then my food is gone, but it actually took me an appreciable amount of time to eat this meal.

When I went back to Montreal again, I found myself in Eggspectations and I suspect that wherever one crops up, I will be in there.  OH MAN IT WAS SO SO GOOD.  GO THERE!  GO NOW!  HOP A BUS OR A TRAIN OR DRIVE... IT'S WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Bad news bears when I go to write my review and multiple people have had issues with this place. Sigh, I remember when this chain had a location out in the Vaughan Mills mall and it disappeared one day without a trace. And if what I experienced here on Saturday is any sign of what happened I understand. 

I usually write reviews with excessive detail for places that tickle my fancy, but all I gotta say is: Long LONG black stringy wavy hair at the bottom of my California Eggs Benedict, BARF!!!!!

Shame I was really enjoying the smoked sockeye salmon, asparagus and spinach covered with Hollandaise and eggs and surrounded by whole wheat toast.

Big hair means you lose...My Eggspectations of this place were too high i guess. The only reason they're receiving a second star is because the server dealt with it quickly and apologetically. However, for next time, asking if I want another one made shouldnt be an option...just make it. I'm paying for the meal I obviously don't want to go hungry...

Anyway, I'm just bitter that I nearly ate an entire rope of black hair.

Check your food next time folks"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by the hotel concierge as one of the better breakfast places close to the hotel.  It was only three blocks away.  

We were weary at first when we saw what appeared to be the menu in the window but turned out to only be six specials.  

The menu actually offered quite a bit of variety and included egg puns on almost every different choice.  

Between the Eggspectation and the Eggcellent, everyone enjoyed their meals.  Prices were average for the egg dishes and everything else seemed about right.  Fresh orange juice and good coffee.

Right in between Station Place d'Armes and Station Peel."}
{"text":"Vous avez faim d'oeuf? Alors, c'est la qu'il faut vous arrêter. Pocher, frits, en sauce, en omelette, battus, rebattus, cuits ou crus, ils vous attendent accompagnés délicieuse fèves sucrées aux lardons et de très bonnes pommes de terre a la lyonnaise.
Si vous n'êtes pas en plein hiver, vous pourrez profiter de la terrasse couverte et protéger dans ce quartier calme et super typique du mont royal. Shopping et détente à proximité. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent breakfast place with a lot of options. The portions are pretty substantial, and the waiter was especially polite. When I didn't finish my meal, he came by to ask if I had any feedback."}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast. The staff is friendly and helpful. The menu is fairly extensive and the food delicious!  The French Toast Page is made with brioche and served with tons of fresh fruit (this time it was blueberries, strawberries, melons, pineapple and bananas), Creme Anglaise and maple syrup. There were 3 huge pieces of toast, filling a platter.  Belgian Waffle Page was the same as the toast, plentiful and delicious. The MixMatch omelette had bacon, sausage and cheddar cheese, potatoes, toast and large garnish of fruit slices. The orange juice here is something we have remembered fondly and we're not disappointed-tastes like freshly squeezed tangerine juice.  It was so yummy we will probably be back tomorrow and the next day!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot with a huge variety of all-day breakfast plates from egg bennies to Montreal bagel sandwiches to every type of omelette imaginable to pancakes, and french toasts and crepes, oh my! Tons of substitution options and sides to customize into a low carb, healthy, or vegetarian (or meatatarian) meal.

I've been here on multiple occasions and was never disappointed with the quality of food or service. Even in a large group, the staff manage to bring out dishes in a timely fashion, hot and orders are exactly what is requested.  There are some staff who are exceptionally, and I mean exceptionally nice.  

My favourite menu items are the Eggspectation breakfast bagel sandwich, California Dreaming Benedict and Montrealer. Free refills on coffee too and a full bar for those who need a little spike in their beverage.  

It's a big open space just outside of the Eaton Centre.  Outdoor seating available in the summer. TV at the bar."}
{"text":"We were supposed to go to another restaurant for lunch. I wish I could invent a time machine so I could have gone to the other restaurant. 

I ordered the brovacdo which is pouched eggs over avocado. There was an avocado and I'm not sure what happened to the poached egg because a hard boiled egg showed up.  We told the waiter and he was kind of enough to make a second attempt but he gave me a small bowl of water with \"poached eggs\" with tomato sauce and egg shells.

We then ordered a waffle to share but they decided the waffle should be made of muffin batter and not waffle batter and then decided not to cook the waffle all the way through. It was a valiant effort at anything except a waffle.

If anyone has a time machine please let me borrow it for this meal/experience.

If you find a Wendy's nearby go there first and then again after you realize there are no time machines to make your experience better."}
{"text":"Went there last month by myself around 10 am on a weekday, and did not feel satisfied (mostly because of the service). 

Let's talk about food first. I ordered the French Toast Flame, and I guess it was satisfying. Its probably a 3.5/5, since I've never eaten french toast before and I believe they be better. I had two large pieces of thick french toast with lots of syrup and who knows what they added in to it (it says it has Triple Sec Orange Liqueur). It was fairly sweet, and the taste was pretty average. What I liked most was that the fruits - banana, straberry and walnuts - also soaked up the sweet syrup. Thank god for that. It was overall filling for brunch. 

Now let's get to the most unsatisfying part - the service. I was seated by a young women to the very end of the restaurant, and against the wall. Seriously, does everyone who goes into a restaurant alone gets seated at the worst part of the place, when most of the great tables for two are empty??? Next, When I was ready to order, I waited ten minutes to be seen. The waiter seemed inpatient and didn't care about his job. When I was about to get my check, I waited for another ten minutes. Unfortunately, the waiter I asked to get my check was not in charge of my table, so I was totally ignored even though he said \"sure\" and waited another five minutes for my waiter to finally get my check. Service deserves a 2/5."}
{"text":"this place is a huge disappointment. first real meal in Montreal and i had high expectations because of the name and everything on the menu. Don't call your dish Extravagant if it ain't. slow service. waitress was always on a rush. food came. i wasn't excited. it's diner food. some diner places like Perkins is even better. plating did not look like the photos. pancakes were dry, not fluffy. poached eggs were still watery. 2 strips of bacon. the potatoes were good but you'll get tired of it after a few bites. they put a random slice of watermelon and pineapple possibly just to fill in the space and feel ooh free fruits. no. don't come here for overpriced breakfast. you can get it anywhere."}
{"text":"Twas awesome. I remember having a fruit smoothie that was damn good."}
{"text":"Arrive restaurant about 1030 for breakfast the host have sit us in five min service was so bad we have wait about half hours n none server was greeted us or knowledge us to let us know be right with us then we just left"}
{"text":"Came here multiple times since it's close to downtown but never enjoyed brunch here. It's too industrial for me, to be honest. I cant find anything exceptional in their food and the portions are so large that you feel overstuffed and unhappy when you're done. I have had their eggs Benedict which were all right. Also had their lunch at this place which had slightly better offering than their brunch options. Their place des arts venue is pretty because it overlooks Quartier des spectacles and they have a terrace during summer. I'd rather go to chez cora if i really have to consume chain food."}
{"text":"My friend and I got to the restaurant to have breakfast, there were a ton of empty tables outside and inside. I kept noticing the groups of people ahead of us turning around and walking out. When we got to the front the hostess told us that there was a 45 min wait. I looked around at the tables as the hostess asked if we wanted to wait and responded no thank you. What's the point of being open if you're turning down customers. Horrible!"}
{"text":"Relaxed ambiance and delicious food. We had Veg omelette and southwest sunrise, both were yummy...and fresh squeezed orange juice. Service was quick and attentive. With hearty portion of healthy breakfast, we were all set to explore Montreal. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We walked out the door. 
The hostess was not welcoming at all. Sat us down and then for about 15 minutes; nothing. No hello, no glass of water, no menus, nothing. Seriously? We only had an hour to eat so this was really unacceptable. We left and went next door"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch places I've ever been to Eggspectation. Decor is very nice and the service was quick. They have a huge breakfast menu that it took some time to decide what I wanted to actually get. I went with one of their eggs Benedict dishes with pancetta and it was delicious. Moderately priced, good service and amazing food. The only negative thing I would say is that their Bloody Mary was not that great but the food far than made up for it."}
{"text":"Eggspectations

Ever wondered what it would be like to have an entire meal with eggs as the main ingredient? 
You might think it's somehow weird but trust me it is an eggceptional taste...

Eggspectation is a restaurant located in Montreal (St-Catherine, Maisonneuve, Laurier, Cote Des Neiges, Rockland center....) it is  one of montreal's famous restaurants known for it's delicious breakfasts, lunches, and dinners.

Our Eggspectation experience was one of a kind. It all started by a warm welcoming ambiance, the waiters are very friendly and \"treat their customers the way they would treat a guest in their own home.|...
we started by  \"Brie and Wallnut Crostini\" as an entree (Ciabatta bread broiled with brie and drizzled with honey, garnished with nuts and fresh apples) It was heavenly.
As for the main course, we ordered the 
- Tropical salad (spinach with mango papaya and grapefruit, topped with honey mustard grilled chicken and roasted sunflower seeds) 
- The Mushroom Melt (patty grilled to perfection and served with thyme-aioli sauce, sautéed mushrooms and melted provolone cheese.
- The Classic Eggs Benedict (2 perfectly poached eggs, on ham and a toasted english muffin, topped with the famous hollandaise sauce and lyonnaise style potato)

We were very well served, the music was entertaining. If you're craving for a good breakfast, lunch or dinner, Eggspectation is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Over-priced for breakfast, but you can go here for the delicious eggs and the fruit. They have a fantastic selection of egg-dishes and their fruit salad was delicious. But the rest of the menu was so-so to sub-par. Their pancakes are about the size (and taste) of hockey-pucks and their sausage was way too salty."}
{"text":"Proof that downtown Toronto is lacking a local diner feel, is right before your eyes here on Yelp.

My girlfriend and I had just got home from a holiday, down in Florida, and we had a craving for some eggs Benedict.

We have been disappointed on the last few occasions that we went out for breakfast downtown, though, Fran's is pretty good.

We go to eggspectation, and it is packed! Full, of people from the government buildings close by, and people working in the financial district, on their lunch. 

We both ordered a cup of coffee, and decided to split the $5.95 smoothie, since we never would have been able to finish one each. We saw another table had already ordered one. 

My gf ordered the eggs Benedict with the avocado, and tomato, and I ordered the traditional eggs Benedict.

The server brought over the huge smoothie, filled to the top, and brought an empty glass. When I pointed out that I asked for the smoothie to be split (I would have made a mess of it everywhere at the table), the server had told me \"we do not split things here\"... 
Strike one.

When our meal came, I was surprised, and totally disappointed that the \"Traditional\" eggs Benedict came with a single slice of deli cut black Forest Ham. Peameal Bacon is considered traditional, in Canada. My girlfriend's egg Benedict had tomato that was more pink and white that red. It needed another week on Vine. Strike two.

Our server came over and asked if everything was ok, and I told them that I wasn't impressed at all, and I wasn't expecting cold cut ham. He told me the ham is supposed to be cooked... It was a single thin slice of black Forest Ham. Not sure how he meant it was supposed to be cooked. Strike three.

The hollandaise sauce was good. I will give the kitchen that.

However, that is not my idea of a diner. They are flourishing with customers from downtown... That clearly have no other options for breakfast, other than Fran's. 

If you want sub par eggs Benedict, and an overall snobby feel around you, look no further than eggspectation. Its reeks of downtown Turronah."}
{"text":"My choice for brunch every Sunday. We've tried many other brunch spots in town, but Eggspectation is just better. Although eggs (benedict in particular) are their specialty, the menu is so vast you can literally come every week for 2 years and never be bored. Dozens of choices of omelets, pancakes (the best in town!), waffles, bagels... And everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Delicious and filling but at the end of the day it is eggs so you can't expect a miracle."}
{"text":"Downstairs from the Hyatt regency and across from the Place des Artes, this crowded place has lovely indoor and outdoor seating. Great selection of breakfast items, perfect for the hungry traveler."}
{"text":"Yummy brunch food (I had an omelet and latte), fun and casual environment. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Gourmet prices for a perfectly average omelet.  If you absolutely need eggs and you're in the neighborhood, go there.  But don't go out of your way for what is essentially an IHOP."}
{"text":"I begged to come here a second time. Seriously. Good eats and lots of food for a reasonable price.

The first morning we popped in and I ordered the French toast. Amazing. Blown away. Perhaps some of the best breakfast I have ever eaten. Sorry, Dad. Your French toast just doesn't cut it anymore."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and brunch!!! Had to go back for brunch two mornings in a row!!! Lovely service, fresh food, great atmosphere.. Def going back when I'm back in Toronto!"}
{"text":"La bouffe est bonne, l'emplacement est agréable avec une belle ambiance. Le service est parfois bon et parfois acceptable selon si c'est le propriétaire, une serveuse ou une autre serveuse qui fait le service. On devrait par contre offrir de conseiller les gens parce que ce n'est pas tout ce qui est sur le menu qui plaît à tout le monde et vu qu'il n'y a pas de photos à côté de chacun des items parfais ce que sort de la cuisine n'est pas aussi bon que ce à quoi on s'attend..... C'est ensoleillé avec probabilités de déception....."}
{"text":"Good place to stop for breakfast. Right in the heart of the city. Good spot to people watch while you eat."}
{"text":"Yup! Some good breakfast here. I had the high rise pancakes with eggs, sausage, bacon and medallion home fries. I gave it my best shot but couldn't eat it all. My wife had the the smoked salmon eggs benny and side fruit. Both were very good. The coffee was refilled when I wanted and was hot. They have a large menu with a lot of interesting choices. Will come back again to sample some more when I'm in the area. 

We thought we would be waiting to get in as we arrived on a Sunday at about 9 but got in with almost no wait. When we left about an hour later though, it was packed at the front with customers waiting. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"The decor was better than I expected and service was fast. I started off with a Bloody Mary that was terrible. I switched to a screwdriver and I'm happy to say the orange juice was freshly squeezed!! I ordered the Montreal egg Benedict with smoked meat and Swiss and it was delicious!! I was a little disappointed with the Lyonaisse potatoes because on the menu it stated they came with caramelized onions. All I got was fried sliced potatoes. They were not sauteed and there wasn't one single onion on my plate. The fruit cup was absolutely delicious and fresh. It wasn't perfect but overall a good breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor dining, really fast food preparation, and decent service. The menu is huge - we both had versions of eggs benedict (they have about 10 different types) and they were very good. Portions were huge and the espresso was not the best I had in Montreal, but good enough. Great place for a delicious and fast sit-down breakfast."}
{"text":"The presentation of the food was only out done by the quality of it. Each of our meals were exceptionally  done."}
{"text":"Great friendly service. The servant took his time to explain the menu and the surrounding area of fun things to do. Food was good & a large menu options."}
{"text":"Tasty, reasonable breakfast. Homemade hollandaise on the bennies (yum!). Mediocre service, but overall, a good breakfast option in an area of town where there aren't many."}
{"text":"We ventured a few kilometers to get to this restaurant and, my oh my, we were not disappointed. The atmosphere is incredibly open and family friendly and service was relatively fast. The real gem is the expansive menu, which is truly all-encompassing from eggs Benedict, to pancakes, to the French toast (highly recommend), to pasta and burgers. Juices are freshly squeezed and all natural. Eggstravaganza is a great dish to try. 

Most importantly, this is the restaurant where I found out I got into medical school, and it holds a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Really wanted to check out this place place after the yelp reviews, and finally got the chance today. We ordered the smokey salmon Benedict, Southwest sunrise omelette and fresh toast (without the flambe- as my friend and I don't consume alcohol).
The food gets an overall three stars, the Benedict was overcooked and not runny at all, and the French toast was swimming in Maple syrup and tooo sweet! We ordered whipped cream (extra $) on the side to help us get through it, though we couldn't to get too far.
The omelette was true to it's description and again OK. (Couldn't take a picture of that).
Service- not a very busy day by the time we got there, and the server was friendly and had to be prompted for water. But after a couple of times of asking, would just come over and refill our glasses with water (it was a very hot day and we needed out water!) 
Overall, an ok experience. Would've liked to try the lobster Benny as in the reviews, but was too got for lobster and again theres no guarantee the benedict quality would be any better than I had."}
{"text":"Really great service staff and the food is fast and delicious. Highly recommended for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I love those egg puns all over the place. Love 'em! I first ate at the Montreal location and was super pleased to see one in Toronto. It's right in the middle of downtown at the Eaton Centre and I've been for breakfast a few times. It's tasty, but your mileage may vary extensively based on what you pick out of the extensive menu. It's bright and open with windows that let you people-watch on the busy Yonge strip - which I enjoy.

There's lots to choose from - \"speggtacular\" variety, if you will. (I'm sorry, had to get one pun in there.) In fact, there's almost too much to look at, so you might be stuck wondering how one presentation of lox and capers and red onions and eggs is different from another, etc... sometimes the items do exhibit this kind of repetition.

You can get their eggs Benedict in a variety of styles, and they have \"signature\" breakfasts that combine eggs (usually any style you want) with pancakes, crepes, bagels, latkes, steak, you name it... you can also find omelettes, sandwiches, savoury crepes, waffles, burgers... it's a bit overwhelming but it's all done to a pretty good standard, though sometimes the dishes are too heavy on carbs like extra toast and potatoes - I'm already having pancakes or somesuch thing, so thanks but no thanks. They seem to do certain dishes with a more delicate approach - which is good - and others with a ho-hum cheese-n'-bacon style that is not very appetizing. 

They serve really tasty fresh squeezed orange juice - an absolute staple in my mind, and one that a lot of breakfast places miss the mark on. Also, I'm not a huge fan of the potatoes that come with many of the dishes - they are medallion-style, and you expect them to be light and crisp but they end up just kind of floppy and boring and needing ketchup or salt to make them worthwhile. 

Service can be a bit slow as it's a big place and there's a lot of tables to attend to - if you're the type of person who can't go a second without a coffee refill this may bug you (speaking of which, they serve a darn good coffee or espresso!), but they are friendly and fairly efficient."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this: I do not like eggs. I actually hate them. They are quite possibly the most revolting food item in exsistance (I know, I know most people love them...). Hard boiled, fried, poached, scrambled, it doesn't matter, I can't stand the taste or smell of eggs.

So when my colleague suggested we go to eggspectations for breakfast since it was across the street from our hotel... well let's just say my \"eggspectations\" were quite low (I know, lame pun right? Well screw you  :-P)

In any case, I resorted to ordering French Toast (egg batter on French Toast is OK since it doesn't taste like eggs... that's right you just got told, son), with bacon and coffee as I do in most other egg-centric breakfast joints They were actually quite good. 

Finally, let me make another quick point: The service here is actually good. I emphasize that point because Montreal is notorious for horrible pretentious shitty service (See this fine example: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/tokyo-sushi-montreal#hrid:YRWhUwbcZoPO46YEji7sHQ). 

I might come here again if I'm in the area but I would rather eat at a Cora's for example, which has many many more non-egg related breakfast items."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times and the food is always good. Never blow your mind good and it's a little pricey- but still good enough to come here multiple times for bunch.

Eggs Benedicts are always a solid option and the potatoes are good. 

Would recommend, but also Cora's is also a solid option in the area."}
{"text":"Un peu decevant ! Comparé à plusieurs chaines de dejeuners a montreal, les prix sont beaucoup plus haut et la qualité est moindre ! 

Je n'ai pas vraiment apprécié ! 

Le service etait bon , mais c'est tout !"}
{"text":"Last minute decision turned out to be very good! Beat the grounds & enjoy some delicious breakfast foods! Staff was attentive & so nice! 

Freshly squeezed orange juice ... truly was!!! Yum! The coffee was just right ! Both the southwest omelette & fresh start were quickly brought to our table & tasted very fresh! The potatoes were very flavorful & the fruit was fresh & did not taste out of can! Hooray! Very pleased with both options!"}
{"text":"Truly awesome.  I never though breakfast could be worth an hour wait, but at this place it is.  The service is efficient but not overly friendly - I guess this makes sense as the gratuity is included.  As Americans, we weren't necessarily expecting that but it makes sense.  We still left extra anyway."}
{"text":"Good service.   This looks like a traditional Canada place.  Good outdoor seating.  Seems pipular"}
{"text":"Perfect place to come for breakfast when you don't want the hotel breakfast in Montreal. We had a ten minute wait but the food was worth it. Our waitress was great as well, very patient as we decided on our food. The menu has many options so it was kind of hard to decide. My only complaint would be that my French toast was a bit too soft but the flavor was still great."}
{"text":"4 stars for this place?? That's surprising. I was debating whether to give it 2 or 3 stars but decided to go for 3. 

The food is really mediocre. Its basically what you can expect from a big chain (although this place isn't a chain). I had the omelette, and it actually taste below average. I'm not sure how you can make an omelette taste below average?? Maybe the eggs are low quality. They are also quite stingy with the fries. 

The decor inside is nice, and the prices are fairly reasonable (omelette was $12). 

Its a little hard to find. It's actually located in what looks like an office building."}
{"text":"This resto is very good at what they do-eggs. They have plenty of options for it too! If your feeling like a breakfast meal or brunch this is your optimal spot. There new location is not the easiest to find but it's nicely tucked in where trinity square is which is cozy. The inside is super modern and is constantly playing top40s which is enjoyable, but can be irritating because they do crank it out and of your not into it it could be bothersome. I'm into it tho so I'm happy! At five dollar mimosas whose complaining?"}
{"text":"Great breakfast & brunch place! Very busy on a Sunday morning, even at the tail-end of their lunch hours (1:30pm). The outdoor patio was well shaded and lively, and staff was very welcoming. Service was quick and efficient, our coffee was always kept hot with refills. The food was great--had one of their most popular eggs benedict dishes (smoked salmon benny) with fruit on the side. The toast was a little less toasted than I'd hoped but the salmon/cream cheese/eggs benny/hollandaise sauce combo was absolutely genius. Fruit was super fresh and sweet too. Will totally come back to try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"Ahhh yes.  I love eggspectations creative breakfast dishes they offer as it's quite delicious and prices are more than fair.

I ordered the \"High Rise\" which was pancakes with sausage, potatoes, bacon in between with sunny side egg on top!! It was everything I wanted separately so decided...why not?? It turned out to be quite the flavor combination and totally satisfied my craving for breakfast food for lunch when I landed in Toronto!  Will definitely be back.  

Only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is due to their coffee.  It wasn't great, just ok.  I don't think most restaurants get coffee right so if I could give 4.5 I would've."}
{"text":"If they can't do the way you like eggs, your eggpectations must be way too high.

There is literally 6 plus sections for eggs cooked all different ways. They even have a whole section for different types of eggs benedict. To be honest, the initial menu glance was all but straightforward. I flipped flopped between a few choices before deciding on the lobsters benedict. I've also never had an Irish coffee and the $6 CAD price tag was pretty appealing.

Our food came out so fast, especially given the crowd and assumption of wait times. The eggs were just okay though. I do think it's partially on me, as seafood + cream + breakfast doesn't always sit well with me unless we're talking lox and cream cheese. I should've trusted my gut when ordering but alas, I made the choice. The dish was well made but just not my favorite. My coffee was also okay. Again, it's me, not the restaurant. I'm glad to have been able try an Irish coffee at least.

Prices are fair, selection is endless, and while nothing seems mind-blowingly amazing, it's a great breakfast staple in downtown. Download the app No Wait to put your name down remotely and skip the line!"}
{"text":"To be fair, maybe I should have had the eggs, but from the great reviews, I decided on the French Toast.  I had it with fruit, which turned out to be mostly honeydew melon and cantaloupe, which I don't think make good toppings for French Toast.  On top of that, I found the toast to be pretty dry.  I also had bacon, which I requested be well done, but I got something slimy and limp. Service was pretty slow, even though they weren't busy.  Lots of good reviews of this place, so maybe I caught them on a bad day, but I would have been better off with room service in my hotel."}
{"text":"Can't say much really.... Great breakfast food, great drinks ( Bloody Mary  and a screwdriver) 

You can mess up simple breakfast food, thankfully they have exceeded my eggceptation...."}
{"text":"We went to Eggspectation after a recommendation from the concierge at the W Montreal.  Our requirement was simple... breakfast within walking distance.  

Over the food was fine and really not the main reason for my low rating.  While it wasn't spectacular, portions were good and it was tasty... just not great.

Now let's talk about service... simply put... SLOW!  There seemed to be no sense of urgency despite a line of people waiting for seats.  Our waiter was pleasant but terrified and absentminded.  Honestly I'm not sure it was an issue with his ability or the fact that the place seemed severely understaffed for a Sunday morning.  The whole place seemed like a perfect candidate for one of those takeover shows that works to turn a bad business around with a few easy and logical steps."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with an old friend and the girlfriend. I have had mixed experience at Eggspectations before but this one seemed really nice. 

I had the cabin de sucre , which was pancakes, eggs, baked beans and fruit. Everything was delicious and seemed quite fresh. My girlfriend was impressed with the whole variety of eggs Benedict, and said it was quite delicious."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the service sucked. First, let me start with the food.

I went here the weekend of May 24th with my husband.  First we ordered the Brie and Walnut Crostini as a starter. This dish was nice, but nothing to write home about.  My husband ordered a Cobb Salad, which he said was okay, and I order a dish that contained Macaroni and Cheese. It was good, although extremely greasy. Overall, the food was definitely \"meh,\" nothing stellar.

The service was even more sub-stellar.  We had this tacky waitres who became flippant when we questioned her about the use of the handheld payment processing devices. She flippantly says ALL restaurants in Toronto have been using this system for years. Oh really?  I went to Toronto last year for several days and ate at many establishments. Not a single one of them used this device to process my payment.  Now it is okay that she is ignorant of the fact that there are actually places in Toronto that don't use these handheld devices- at least last year (that would cover her MANY years BS). But, for her to act as if what she said was the gospel truth, make some other snide comments, AND disrespect a customer is...well stupid. If she EGG-spected me to give her a good tip, she was wrong. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Found this cute cafe on Yelp while visiting the city and decided to give it a go. Ordered blackstone Benedict and the sauce is great as most of the Yelp reviews say!

Love the combination of avocado, bacon, and egg. My bf ordered omelette but I secretly think my benedict is better... oops :p 

Coffee is alright, not too impressed, but the service was nice and welcoming. Price is pretty reasonable comparing to the ones in California (usually go up to $15 USD before tax and tips.. sad)"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic restaurant!  We loved our breakfast there.  Service was great food was fantastic"}
{"text":"Yum! Yes this is a chain and there's a location three steps away from my home in Toronto, BUT this had a nice shady patio, and we wanted to just chill and eat some eggs. I had the breakfast wrap and it was so good. Part of it wasn't warm (didn't bother me) but my fiancé's French toast also had undercooked parts so that may be a pattern. The pickle in the Caesar was yummy.  Service was good, overall satisfactory."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in Montreal, awesome Southwestern omelet and seafood eggs brings the best nutrition and energy to me to start the day!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, the waiter was really nice. I had a large problem because I got my eggs scrambled with cheese and I was not informed that the cheese would cost an extra 3$ because I have never heard of that before. After speaking with the manager he informed me that hes been to America and that they charge for cheese when its with the meal. I was very disappointed in how the situation was handled. I would take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast before my family and I left for our next stop on a road trip since it was near the hotel we were staying at. The lobster eggs benedict was delicious and Belgian waffles were soft with a generous amount of fruits. However we were in a rush for time to our next destination and had trouble catching our waiter or any waiter for that matter to give us the check for about a good 15 minutes... may be a bit understaffed for 2 floors of seating"}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch spot! We had just gotten in to Toronto and we were looking for a good brunch spot - glad we found this one! The food was really really good and it was in a great spot in Toronto. 

The only draw backs were the long wait for the table, the long wait for service once we were at a table, and the long wait for food when we placed our orders - but it was a busy day so I can't fault the restaurant too much on this! I do wish we were told the long food wait a little earlier in the process, but again - not the end of the world. 

The omelets were great and they were very nice in letting us make some substitutions. The potatoes were the highlight of the dish, though. Crispy but fluffy and seasoned well! The coffee was a little weak but it tasted good and the staff was pretty attentive to refilling our cups - so that was nice.

Would recommend! Just try to come at a less busy time and you'll have a better experience overall."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast with my dad whilst in Montreal for the weekend. There was a bit of a line forming, but as we were only two people, there was a spot for us immediately upon arrival. We were there on a Sunday at 9:30 am so it was obviously going to be busy.
I have nothing bad to say about the service or the food. For the amount of guests in the restaurant, I thought the service was very speedy, and our server was welcoming. I ordered Belgian waffles with strawberries and was able to get Nutella instead of butter. My dad ordered the Montreal plate (or something to that extent) and said it was a lot to eat (and he eats a lot usually)."}
{"text":"I usually know what to Eggspect from this place. I don't come here if I'm looking for a hip brunch place or something a little different. As with most chain restaurants, there's a level of service and food quality that rarely exceeds the eggspected level. 

My boyfriend and I had some shopping to do at the Eaton Center and our bellies were grumbling. When we rocked up to the host he told us that the eggspected wait would be 5-10 minutes. We sat and were called within 3. Our table was a small two top literally 5 cm away from the next table. The woman on the bench who was already seated had her shoe box right where my ass was supposed to go. She made no attempt to move it even when it became obvious that I was waiting for her to. This had no bearing on the restaurant, but perhaps the hostess could have asked her to move her eggceptionally large box.

Despite it being busy, not all tables were in use. But I understand how this works with staffing. I've seen people freak out because they have to wait for a table even though there are ones open. Just because you can sit down doesn't mean that the restaurant has enough staff to serve you properly. So here's a tip: don't be a dick to the host. There is a reason you're not being seated and it has nothing to do with an open table.

Our server was cute and cheery. My man had a grapefruit juice and I ordered an Americano. Both arrived after a bit of a wait, but my Americano still had a decent film of crema on it, so I was happy. My bf liked his grapefruit juice. It was obvious that it had been had been squeezed somewhat recently as there were little seeds floating in it. 

He had the classic Eggs Benedict and I had the Mykonos Omelette with a side of bacon. I was actually surprised at how good the omelette was. Nice and salty with a smattering of oregano on top. Bacon was like tracing paper-- super thin. I prefer a nice meaty strip, but hey-- that's just me. My dude gobbled his breakfast. I'm guessing that meant it was good.

Eggspectation is an okay spot. It's good for groups at brunch or on the weekend when trendier breakfast/brunch spots are crammed with hipsters, but as a general rule these chain places lack personality, which I think is kind of a brunch-y thing."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast! The first couple times here, the service was slow but today we had great service. Had the banana java (espresso, chocolate milk, honey, and bananas) and it was sooo delicious!! I'm obsessed with getting the southwest sunrise omelette (onion, pepper and cheese inside with salsa, avocado, and sour cream on top) served with potatoes, a slice of cantaloupe, and a slice of orange. They also give you a bread basket to go with you omelette. The basket has all sorts of spreads like butter, grape jam, orange marmalade, and peanut butter. It definitely gets busy during peak times and it's always worth the visit."}
{"text":"A solid spot of standard breakfast food. It has a large menu with everything from eggs to bacon to Greek yogurt. The Go Bananas smoothie was very good and the toast was dripping with butter. Overall, if you're craving some standard breakfast fare, it's a good spot to go."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for brunch. We were very excited about this place because of the high Yelp rating, but the experience was quite disappointing. We literally waited for more than 1 hour to get our dishes. According to the waiter and his fellow's reactions we concluded that he forgot to place our orders.

Then here were the plates, apparently made in a rush. The waffles I ordered made me miss my frozen Eggo, let alone the greasy omelette and the poor little eggs benedict my friends had.

Yelp is not always right."}
{"text":"Huge breakfasts served all day. \"the all American\" was very good if you want something simple. Service was spotty mostly because the waiters would disappear when we needed their attention. They were able to separate the checks which was great. The waffle was forgettable and expensive. I recommend egg dishes! If you need a quick yummy breakfast in downtown I recommend this."}
{"text":"This place is the place to get  a heartybreakfast especially if you like a full satisfying breakfast. Ate here with the family twice -we had a French toast (brioche -amazing),pancakes ,bagels -tried a lot of different things everything was great- they have large combination breakfasts that we were able to share between two people- the latte was great fresh squeezed orange juice was also good -service was very friendly -nice location spacious large benches to sit on -prices were good for the quality and amount of food"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. i have this thing about greasy food and their breakfast is far better than any where i tried in Toronto. their environment, their food and their patio is great. always crave for this place."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad for breakfast

The omelette and steak was okay. Okay meaning the omelette wasn't spectacular and the steak was a little dry. 

They didn't have any eggs Benedicts so I ordered the omelette instead

Overall 4 stars for decent price for decent food"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place, large, we got in before a line, but you can tell they get packed. Whole menu looks good, it's more wholesome than Epicurean."}
{"text":"Eggspecting something eggstraordinary for brunch? It's typically crowded here on weekends, but take the little eggstra time to wait, and you'll be seated in no time. 

Eggstensive menu that includes a vast selection for those egg haters as well. There's something for everyone at Eggspectation.

My french toast was nothing to be eggscited about, but my over easy eggs were perfectly over easy and my brunch partner eggspecially enjoyed his eggs benny with smoked salmon and asparagus. We both agreed this resto is an eggspert. 

Content and satisfied, we eggsitted knowing we'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about.  Standard diner style omelette.  Uninteresting potatoes.  Good fruit plate.  Definitely not worth going out of your way to eat here. Empty on a weekday at 830 so at least no wait."}
{"text":"This place was so horrible that it's comical. I came here on a Saturday morning with a total party of 8. One star goes out for the friendliness of the staff. Otherwise, nothing good from it. This may be my first 1 star review on my whole yelp account!!

1. Ordered 6 mimosas and there was a huge layer of pulp on the top. My friends hated how bubbly it was (I tolerated it though). No one drank more than five sips.

2. We waited for over a half hour for our food. Mind you, all of us either got pancakes, fruit salad, or eggs Benedict. It's not like we all had different orders. Now, the wait would have been acceptable if it wasn't for point 3 that I will discuss next.

3. Pancakes were straight up cardboard and burnt. One of my friends pancake order was missing the sausage and bacon that came with it. We later found it hidden in between each pancake. Now that was absolutely hilarious. The pancake stack went like this: pancake 1(bottom) - hidden bacon - pancake 2(middle) - hidden sausage - pancake 3(top). How does that even happen???! LOL

Thankfully my eggs Benedict order was tolerable. We ended up spending a little less than 2 hours there. Honestly, we could have made breakfast at our Airbnb, saved money, AND have a better tasting meal. 

I guess the only good thing that came out of this was an insanely good laugh. I really wish I took a picture of the hidden bacon and sausages though. That was seriously priceless."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a major disappointment. We came in around 11:45 for brunch - it was our first time and we are out of town so we decided to check it out, as we had heard good things. We didn't get a table for 40 minutes, even though we were told the wait time would be 20-25. We ordered a banana java, which tasted really good. We then placed our order for 2 omelettes and waited an hour and 5 minutes before it arrived. Our server did not check in with us during our wait, nor did anyone top up our waters. Once the food arrived, the server placed my plate in front of me and then realized it was not the correct order, and thus picked up the plate immediately, as I was about to pour some sauce. Our food would have tasted really good, except it was cold. Definitely not worth the long wait. Worst service we have received, while being in Toronto and thus would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"Excellent veggie omelet with great slices of fruit. Waiter was prompt and very friendly. Will come again for sure."}
{"text":"Busy on a Sunday am - which was a good sign. Group of 7 (3 kids). 
Food took a long time and when arrived it was lukewarm at best. $15 breakfast plates. Good portion of food - but because it took so long kids were hungry so didn't send back. 

Most other tables arrived sooner - and I'm assuming hotter so maybe we just got bad luck due to table size. 

Had to send pancakes back - asked for plain but came with sugar, etc on it."}
{"text":"Anything with a bagel is great but ask for a soft yoke if you like to dip your bagel. Will come with a fully cooked yolk as a standard which was too dry for me."}
{"text":"Very bland cappuccino.

Food comes fast but that's about it. Food is fine but wanting a good coffee with your meal, wait and go somewhere for your coffee after your meal."}
{"text":"I went to this place three times on our recent trip to Montreal. I dig it, though it is a bit inconsistent. 

My boyfriend got the breakfast burger but the fries came out cold. 
One day they made me an iced americano and the next day the ice came on the side so I had to wait a while for it to cool enough to use the ice without it just melting.
One day the hollandaise on my California scramble was amazing, but on my benedict the next day it was broken.
The bravocado was so good! But my eggs were poached to the point of being overcooked - very different from the poached eggs I got on my benedict, where even the whites were still runny.
The french toast page was great! Although the second day it came out cold, with less fruit, and no syrup. 

All this considered, I would still go here. Definitely worth checking out; big selection and yummy smoothies and juices too."}
{"text":"My eggspectations were not high, but from the spaced-out waiter to the overcooked and tasteless scrambled eggs, everything about my lunch was below average. Even Cora is much better than that."}
{"text":"as good as always. didn't expect hamburgers to be soo juicy and yammy!"}
{"text":"This location was perfect walking distance from out Hotel in Saint Marc. We stopped here our first day in Montreal and it really set the tone. Lovely outside sitting. I had the nutella s'more french toast and it was as delicious as it sounds. It came with strawberries and bananas and I was pleased when they came on the side. The french toast wasn't drenched in cinnamon which is a huge plus for me. I got lemonade and it was average..not that good. No refills btw. But that seems to be a trend in Canada. My husband got the pancake stacked dish. I can't remember what it was called but it ended up being kind of similar to a mcgriddle. The maple syrup was the best. I would say this was one of the best breakfast I had while I was there. Would absolutely go back if I'm near a location again."}
{"text":"Great service, a lot of menu options. Big place, not crowded. The food was great ! First time having poutine, and I enjoyed it. Has some cocktail brunch options available as well, including mimosas."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast, fresh ingredients, not a long wait, nice atmosphere with lots of customers...very varied menu, lots of interesting items I'd love to try, definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I had been choking down these horrible breakfast sandwiches at a convention I was attending when I noticed my wife had brought back a takeout from there. I went the next morning, and I was hooked.

I ate the omelette with avocado, salsa, and sour cream. It was all fresh ingredients and it was amazing. The fruit garnish was fresh as well. I also had the smoothie, and those were far better than what I can whip up. And the potatoes, amazing!

This place is worth every penny. Great food; great service! Wish there was one in my hometown."}
{"text":"Took me quite awhile to find this location, since its located INSIDE a building and isn't its separate storefront. It was well worth it when we received our food. The menu itself is a piece of art, with each dish having its own punny name and detailed description. There was a plethora of options to choose from and I wanted everything! My boyfriend and I eventually settled for \"The All American\" and \"Eggsuberant\". While the prices may seem a tad bit high, this isn't like your average IHOP. All servers were smartly dressed and had impeccable table service as well! I left feeling comfortably full with a smile on my face. I recommend visiting on a weekday to avoid a wait and be seated immediately."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had. 
Visiting from Ohio, USA we saw good reviews for Eggspectations and the restaurant definitely lived up to them. The French toast is fantastic. The s'mores french toast is beautifully presented; it wasn't an IHOP glob of chocolate over toast that we thought it'd be.
We went here for breakfast for 2 of the 3 days we were in town.

Tl;dr: Their French toast is awesome."}
{"text":"It's your basic breakfast joint. Service was decent and nothing to complain about. Location was good on Saint Catherine next to the Hyatt."}
{"text":"Meals are over priced but not bad in taste. The pancakes are very thick and fill your belly. I was full.  Waiters take forever. Location was a little tough to get to coming from where we were but we found it."}
{"text":"We were there in June on a Friday night when there was a rock music festival.  As expected every restaurant in the area was completely full.  This restaurant is sitting on prime real estate because you can see the festival and all the activities from the patio seating area.  However, the seats are completely crammed and your table is literally a few inches from the table next to you.  Not a very comfortable dining experience.

Food is ok, not bad but nothing spectacular.  Service was adequate and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. In the heart of toronto downtown, Eggspectation will take care of all your brunch needs! It has got amazing ambience with such bright atmosphere. We were immediately seated by their welcoming staff. This place wins on the first impression. Everything is professionally managed. We started our bright morning with freshly brewed breakfast blend coffee. Then came on the freshly squeezed orange and grape fruit juice. We had so much to do for the day, yet time didn't matter at all. Every sip of coffee was a refresher. For the breakfast, we ordered veggie omelette and french toast(smores, nutella) with the side fruits. And some home made fries. The orders were served to perfection. We were checked upon at regular intervals and this service was nothing short of a five star restaurant. I cannot emphasize enough how delicious everything we ordered was. If mornings are to be done right, this is how it has to be. I applaud the management and staff for their commitment and quality. I encourage everyone out there in Toronto downtown to visit this place and enjoy a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Had the California Dreaming Benedict.  Probably one of the best Salmon Egg Benedict I've had.  Menu had many other yummy options aw well."}
{"text":"The veggie dream crepe was good for a quick and light lunch. Stuffed with sauteed mushrooms, spinach, red onions and asparagus, with cheddar, Swiss and Gruyere cheeses. The savoury crepes are served with a mixed field green salad. Having an appointment near by, my order came out quickly and I liked how the vegetables were warm and nicely cooked."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews from the table...

we had 4 different preparation with eggs...an order of pancakes and smores french toast....

the smores french toast was drenched in choc and marshmellows...it was as chocheavenly as it could get....it can be classified as my all time...unique breakfast....very well made plate as well...

The pancakes were burnt at the bottom...

one of the entrees with salmon with underdone sunny side up eggs and hollandaise was a little out of proportion...too much of hollandaise sauce and eggs were a little tooooooo runny.....makin it a very very messy plate...

the other omlettes were fine...the plates were very well setup...and all the orders had a side of fresh fruits....(not canned or not drenched in sugar water)....just clean side of fresh fruits (melons, pineapple, berries)

overall a good one...the smores french toast will be remembered..."}
{"text":"Best Belgian Waffles Page is Too Good!!! All time favourite! So are the pastas. Skip the stake they are just okay. Oh, and have OJ and coffee, both!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent as usual. I've been to Montreal location and fell in love with the restaurant. Eggs Benedict are my favorite and I tried them in many different variations and was always pleased. I really like the decor and the atmosphere. Lots of open space. Can't wait to try the summer patio!"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict are excellent. Been here a few times already! Good service, pleasant atmosphere. Next time I'm at Montreal, I'm definitely come here again! They have it in Toronto as well!"}
{"text":"There were 6 of us there Monday morning about 1015. It wasn't busy at that time. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I feel like home here, although there is a lot I can't eat, the friendly stuff adjusted the dishes according to my allergies. Fruit is fresh and almond cappuccino is excellent, I always return when I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Mark was like the chillest server ever. We were his only table when we arrived but he balanced his time coming to our table and even did a really great job yodeling Avocados to our Eggs Benedict. He was friendly and prompt and came by for refills. The food was simply incredibly. I'm not over-eggsagerating! I loved the environment and was able to sit and look out of the large ceiling-high windows and people watch. I couldn't have been happier with this experience.

And if you need a suggestion, be Bacon Waffle Benedict was to die for! (See attached picture)"}
{"text":"We used to like this place for Sunday mornings in Montreal but it has gone down hill. California Benedict was so cold and soggy it was inedible and service was slow and rude. No more."}
{"text":"Eggspectation is my favourite breakfast place so far. Every time I or we went there we were satisfied by the food and service. 
I love their eggs benedict and omelette variations as well as their pancakes. I haven't tried everything on the menu but the dishes I tried were simply delicious. The food quality seems to be good/fresh.
Depending on when you go there you may have to expect a line up especially on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"We travelled from London, Ont. Forgetting it was Valentines this morning we ventured out in the cold to find breakfast. We came here and to our surprise the line out was huge !!! The hostess worked so hard to get everyone checked in took our name and told us about 20min ... Well within 10 we were seated  It's been a bit hard since we have been in Montreal not speaking French but the hostess noticed and gave us English menus. Our waiter must at noticed as well which was nice. Food was amazing service was excellent !"}
{"text":"Tried their Veggie omlette and Cappuccino. Omlette was good, not great. Menu said it would have caramalized onions, but they put just plain onions cooked along with omlette. It was pretty much raw, and that's exactly how I hate my onions

Place had a nice good morning feel to it (I dunno, it just felt like a good morning when I sat there). Staff was very friendly

Cappuccino was decent, no surprises there"}
{"text":"Good size portion for the price.  Much better than the option for breakfast at my hotel.  I prefer my bacon a bit more crispy.  Good service and coffee.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a damn good breakfast in Montréal, you've found it!

The highlight of the meal, for me, has been the potatoes cooked with onions.  They were a pleasant surprise the first time I had them.  I'm used to your average \"diner home fries\" that aren't ever anything to write home about.  But these are clearly fresh cut potatoes, cooked to order.  

But the absolute STAR of the show is the fresh squeezed orange juice!  The large is around $6, but worth every penny.  I've yet to find a better glass of OJ anywhere.

On weekend mornings you'll usually have a pretty decent sized line out the door.  It goes without saying that if that's the case during the winter, you best not forget your hat. But grab yourself a Mirror off the rack or chat up some of your hungry line mates.

The service is usually very friendly and willing to joke & chat while taking your order... I've only had one instance where we had a moody waitress, but she wasn't rude, so I assumed it was just a bad day.  We've all had them.

Eggspectations is definitely my place for breakfast whenever I visit Montréal."}
{"text":"Eggcelent choice for breakfast/brunch in Old Montreal. (See what I did there?) Service was quick but warm & friendly and the food was perfect."}
{"text":"Average food average service....good try. if I just go to Easton centre or hang out around city hall, this may be a good choice to have a brunch, but not worth a 20 minute drive from uptown to downtown.

I ordered Lobster Benny which is good but little bit smelly ....not well processed. My aunt's one of the egg benedict is overcooked. The waitress quickly offered a new one. The beverage is ok, no surprise.

Mmm.....the fruit portion is quite small, especially comparing to Allo Moncoco lol"}
{"text":"Just got back from my first visit to Montreal.  Surprisingly, one of the highlights of my visit was my trip(s) to Eggspectation.  That is aiside from the Red Wings-Canadiens game that is.

Just to give you a sense of how delighted I was with my breakfast, I went there twice.  The place is huge, and you're most likely going to be greeting with a line on weekends.  However, the service is friendly and they move through tables quickly.  My first breakfast consisted of the smoked meat benedict with potatoes.  While I am not a smoked meat expert, I do love meat in general, and this specialty of the North did not disappoint.  My girfriend got an omelet, and she was very happy with it as well.  My second meal there consisted of something a little less regional.  I got a corned beef hash with potatoes.  Like I said, I like my meat.  As with my smoked meat benedict, I liked this dish very much.  I particularly liked how the corned beef hash was made up of very small chunks of meat and potatoes.  I very much prefer this to the large chunky pieces you sometimes find.

Who knows the next time I will be in Montreal, but the next time I go there, I think I know where I am going for breakfast."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelpers that we went to this place. Had really nice brunch. Must try the orange juice - very very fresh. Veggie omlettes and traditional Benedict again very delicious and filling. Very polite staff and awesome service."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from my sister so I tried it out. I ordered the French toast with with fruit and my kids ordered chocolate chip pancakes with bacon and it also came with potatoes. The food was so good. Many kids don't eat onions so I would leave that out of the potatoes. Only think I didn't like is my waitress was hard to find and it's like she was rushing us out because she took our plates without saying if we were done. Other than that this place is great."}
{"text":"Average by Montreal standards. I was there on a Sunday afternoon, the place was empty and yet it took 15 min for my burger to be ready. The burger wasn't anything special, more like a fast food place"}
{"text":"Eggspectation! I came here for Summerlicious 2017 and I was super eggcited because of their menu and other Yelp reviews I saw.

I ordered the:
- Brie and Walnut Crostini: I regretted ordering this because I am not a fan of honey but I appreciated how toasted the ciabatta buns were with a healthy portion of brie

- Avocado Chicken Burger: it was delicious, portions were great! I enjoyed the side of fries.

- S'mores French Toast: oh my goodness! Super sweet yet super good. The smores french toast composed of a brioche stuffed with Nutella and marshmallow, so so good. Adding maple syrup makes it even sweeter but even better. But very sweet, if you do love sweet stuff, this might even be a little too sweet. It came with a side of fruits... drizzled with chocolate of course.

When we were seated, we got glasses of water and ordered. Our server let us know that there was a long wait time for Summerlicious but did not tell us an estimate. However, it was fine for us because waiting is not the problem. I found that the food came out promptly though. I liked the fast and talkative environment in Eggspectation, maybe that's why the time felt fast. But when we finished our meals and paid, my friend paid by cash and waited for his change. However, the server did not give it to him until he asked for it. The server proceeded to ask if he was going to tip or not, which he was (holding money in his other hand). I know that serving in restaurants can be really stressful and it's common courtesy to tip, however it is not necessary. Even if my friend did not want to tip, it was not professional for the server to ask. Our server was fast and efficient though. Just that question threw us off."}
{"text":"It truly did not live up to my eggspectations .. At all. Very disappointing experience.

Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is: 1 for the espresso crema and the second because our waiter Zack was so nice. 

---The Details---

We went in for breakfast food around 130pm, it was busy so we waited 10 minutes for a table.. so eager and excited to eat as we've heard good things.. and I'm a HUGE eggs benny fan. I truly cannot get enough hollandaise in my life lol. 
The hostess, however, neglected to tell us that they had run out of hollandaise sauce, which would have saved so much time for us... and a bad yelp review lol. 
After about 10 minutes we get a table, we waited a bit for our waiter (which is fine, we saw it was busy.) And he did touch base with us to say he'd be right with us, which was very appreciated. I'm in the service industry and can appreciate an attentive waiter/waitress. 
Anyways, we had more than enough time to lurk the large benny section and decide exactly what we wanted. We go to order our carefully thought out benny decisions and he says they're out of Hollandaise so they cannot accommodate our order.. I thought he was joking at first, you'd think the hostess would tell people that upon arrival given the benny section is about 20% of their entire menu AND because Benny's are such a popular breakfast item. I then said, \"why not just make more?\" Being so confused as hollandaise is generally made the day of.. we were then informed that the hollandaise is pre made and brought in from Montreal!? Which turned me off from even wanting to try the Benny's from here ever. Ew. What kind of popular breakfast place doesn't make fresh hollandaise sauce?! 
Nonetheless, we were so hungry so we decided to order some drinks: Espresso crema and a Banana Java smoothie, then choose another item from the menu since there were so many options. 
We received our drinks and had had our hearts set on another couple items. My bf goes to order the bagel sandwich and our waiter tells us they are out of bagels. My Gosh! Yet another popular breakfast item! We were too frustrated at that point to continue through this sort of disappointment so we decided to just order something quick: the bruschetta, just to curb our appetite a tad until we found another place to eat. Zack was very quick to get that to us and we really appreciated him for that and for being so genuinely attentive and kind.

---What we ordered---

The bruschetta:
Wasn't the best we've had, but we did eat the entire thing and the flavours were decent. 

The espresso crema:
It was AMAZING, I can always appreciate a wonderful espresso.

The banana java smoothie:
Was very mediocre. Too watery for a smoothie and relatively bland flavours. 

---------------------------------------------------

Needless to say, I'll never go to this place solely because the hollandaise isn't made fresh in the morning. It's brought in from Montreal and that's just too much of a turn off for me. Makes me wonder what else isn't fresh. Ugh. Stay away. Unless all you want is a great espresso, then definitely go haha. 

M.M."}
{"text":"This is a great place for brunch if you are super hungry. Food is nice, not too delicate, but the portion is huge. I like the smoothies too and it's such a good starter to kick off a great weekend day. The problem is, if you order both smoothie and a brunch dish, you will eventually waste a lot of food. The Californian style omelette is just so so and I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, fantastic place for brunch or breakfast. Try the Benedict and the high-rise pancakes."}
{"text":"A fantastic breakfast spot with an excellent kids menu that's fantasticly priced. 

The service is great this place is a sure bet!"}
{"text":"Came here twice and the food never failed me! Everything was great except the service. Don't get me wrong, the waiters/waitresses were friendly but somewhat felt like they were rushing us to finish our meal and leave . Other than that, the egg Benedict and French toast were delicious. Even my mom with high standards in food found the eggs well done and amazing! Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Let me just say that I Eggspected this place to be amazing and it was, THANK GOODNESS! Great cure for a hangover, too (not that I had one, but my friends did). ;)
So many options, I couldn't decide until I carefully read through all the details. 

The lucky dish that got to mechanically digest in between my teeth and tongue was the SMOKED SALMON BENNY with hollandaise sauce, which was-- dare I say--- Eggsceptionally delectable to top this dish off! I've got to say that I judged my choice based on the picture provided in the menu! That picture realllllly got me!

The smoked Salmon*** was melt-in-your-mouth scrumdiddlyumptiousness (& now I am just using words that do not exist in the English dictionary but you get my drift!). It comes with a side of EXTREMELY fresh fruit salad, meaning nothing was mushy or sweating juices, and it included the fruits you would like! (Banana, blackberries, strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, honeydew and cantaloupe)...that's right! FORGET THE PINEAPPLE THAT MAKES EVERYTHING SOUR! You don't need sour fruit salad! 

I also ordered the PERFECTLY PINK shake from the Juice Bar section of the menu. That includes raspberry, strawberry & Greek yogurt , splash of cranberry juice and drizzle of honey. It was thick and perfect with my eggs.

I'm coming back for more Montreal and more Eggs!!

***There is indeed a difference between Canadian/Montreal Salmon and New York Salmon. It's crazy what happens when you cross a border!! Everything seems fresher."}
{"text":"I love this place period! I came to visit a friend in Canada and was blown away by the food here. My friend casually mentioned a decent place around the corner and it was the best place I have had in the area! I went like 4 times in the week I was there. Though it was always packed when I went the mac and cheese was amazing. And the sweet potato fries were cooked to perfection. Though I cannot remember every dish I had I did remember loved the experience and recommending it to every friend who was going to montreal. I actually loved the raw interior look. It felt industrial and very much a awesome spot to hit up casually."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here on holiday Mondays since it was back at its old location on Yonge.  The food isn't gourmet, but there's lots of choice and good ones at that.  I also like how you can get alternative sides.  I do miss the salad and egg white only options, but the quinoa and flax mix is good too.  Service is usually decent, but there is one server who has messed up my order twice.  Look for the guy who doesn't note orders down on a tablet."}
{"text":"I always make sure to come here when I'm in Montreal. Yeah the name is corny and it's a tourist attraction. We go here because it's close to our hotel, the menu has a great selection, and the portions are generous. Plus anything from the juice bar is good after a hangover. Service was a bit spotty on our last outing.. we had to remind our waiter twice that he had forgotten someone's coffee. But overall, a great place to breakfast/brunch when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great food. Wait was a little bit too long, we are looking around 30-40 minutes AFTER ordering the food. But over all it was good experience. Need to hire more staff to keep up with the customers coming in. My eggs beni were amazing, super fresh and perfectly made, not too oily or overdone. Just perfect"}
{"text":"A great find in the middle of Montreal. Wish they had one in my home town - Burlington, VT!"}
{"text":"Coffee was not good. 

Patio was nice but it sits under a building exhaust outlet. Exhaust was loud but nice in that drowned out the loud, terrible top 40 music blaring out of the speakers as if I was having breakfast in an H&M.

Food was ok.

The server was sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast right down the street from our hotel. Our waiter was great, and even had a map and plotted out things to do for us which was very helpful. Nice selection of food. I tried a Russian themed egg benny that was absolutely delicious. Portions were huge. Definitely a good place to eat breakfast if you're staying in the area. We'll be back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"Great selection of breakfast items at really affordable prices. The wait for a table isn't bad and while crowded the noise levels aren't bad at all. I got the lobster benny (wow, yum) and my friend got the avocado omelette which he downed in about 30 seconds so it was definitely good. Breakfast comes with potatoes (just meh on those) and fruit. If you go with the fruit instead of the potatoes you get a nice fruit cup. Drink menu is great. I love their fresh mimosa. The beer on tap was Sleeman's and my friend liked it. I'd go with more stars but our waiter was so slow that it became frustrating at the end. He kept walking by and stopped asking if we wanted more drinks or coffee or water and then we were clearly done and I know he was busy but he saw us and it took 15 minutes to get the bill. That's just way too slow. We had our coats on and were about to ask a random waiter when ours finally stopped and asked if we were done. I wouldn't go again just because I felt ignored once it was obvious we only wanted water and coffee and no alcohol refills. Food is tremendous though but there's so many choices in the area that service does make a big difference."}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 that left today very satisfied.  We tried the lobster omelette, fruit and yoghurt, classic breakfast, and the Yolk something (a bagel with an egg, bacon and cheese).  Great friendly service.  Only slight issue was the food sat on the counter for a while before it was brought to the table but overall it was fine.  I would recommend for anyone in the area wanting a hearty breakfast.  Portions are huge!"}
{"text":"This place is awful and overpriced. The gravy was cold and all the other food was mediocre. We essentially paid $80 for a terrible meal. I would suggest going to another spot. Dennys is better than this place. Also don't order anything from the lunch side of the menu
Stick to the eggs"}
{"text":"So I'm on a roll with 4 & 5 star reviews, but I just can't give this place less than 5 stars.

We had an incredibly personable, friendly server here who made us feel at home in a strange land (she also happened to be from NYC, which helped---haha).

The menu here made me want to come back a dozen times to try different options. And we did actually come back for the only other brunch we had during our trip rather than branching out to find something else. I had the french toast (which came with eggs, ham, etc) and was blown away. Maybe some of the best french toast I have ever had. And the ham was absolutely perfect too. It was over a week ago and I still remember everything on my plate. 

I'm not much of a drinker, so it was awesome that they had a full juice bar too, so I didn't feel left out while the brunchers boozed. I had the \"Honey Blue\" which was Blueberry, yogurt, honey, and i believe ice. It was awesome, and yes I had a second.

If you are a brunch person visiting Montreal, this is the spot."}
{"text":"We come here for brunch . . . from Buffalo. This place is amazing - the lyonnaise potatoes are absolutely heavenly, the coffee is a little weak but smooth. There isn't a terrible thing on the menu. Absolute favorites are the crepes as well as the salmon Benedict. Service is excellent, worth the wait."}
{"text":"The interior of Eggspectation is SO cute! The space is very spacious and has a quaint, charming, homey feel to it. I absolutely loved it. Service was very prompt at the beginning of the meal, but then tapered off towards the end as we had to wait quite a while for our check - the only reason why I am deducting one star. 

There is a ton of variety on the breakfast/brunch menu. I opted for the All-American Breakfast: 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, potatoes, and toast. It also came with fruit and baked beans on the side. My boyfriend ordered the chicken benedict. We also got a pancake to split, and each ordered a smoothie. I got the \"Go Bananas\" smoothie and found it really delicious and filling. The pancake was light and fluffy though a little on the small side for $3.50 extra. My meal was very simple but delicious and I thought it was a good value for what we paid. Boyfriend's benedict looked yummy with two big pieces of chicken - it also came with potatoes and fruit on the side. 

Great place to start the day and would definitely recommend. Right across the street from Eaton Centre!"}
{"text":"Very lovely place for breakfast. Staff is quick and food is delicious. Great place for kids and families. Their smoothies are amazing and I highly recommend them. Can't wrong here."}
{"text":"After looking for a brunch place on a Sunday where we didn't have to wait too long, my boyfriend and I stumbled on this place. We called ahead and they told us the maximum waiting time would be 15 minutes, which, compared to the other places (45 mins) was amazing. Once we arrived, we got seated in less than 5 minutes. The decor here was really nice, very spacious, and lots of people already dining. The menu had a lot of variety, so it was hard to decide but I went with the Lobster Benedict, and my boyfriend went with the Chicken Benedict. He said his was really good, but oh my god, mine was fantastic. I really tasted that real authentic lobster, but mix that with the eggs and sauce and you get a perfect dish. The fries were also great! I just loved everything about this place. Our food came so fast, our server was friendly, and we got seated in no time on a Sunday peak brunch time! 

I would definitely go back and I'd recommend this to anyone! :)"}
{"text":"You expect a bit more from a place with such a great reviews. It's pretty busy so I had to wait for about 15 minutes, which is okay. I ordered Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. They came hard-boiled. I had to ask a waiter to bring me a proper cooked meal. 
The staff is very nice. They work really quickly, they are very polite. 
The overall experience was positive. Sadly the quality of service is higher than the quality of food."}
{"text":"Indulgent breakfast. Huge portions.  Eggs benedicts were amazing so were the potatoes.  I LUV Montreal breakfasts.  Seems like they always come with a bagel too, as if a begel isn't already its own meal!"}
{"text":"It certainly exceeded all my eggspectations. loved it so much. I heard it gets crowded so we got there pretty early, we were seated right away.

The menu is eggs-tensive...over easy, omelets, Benedicts... and a whole selection of waffles, crepes and pancakes smores..flambé ..and more.

I had bravocado benedict although it came with its own side of fruit and fries(yum) I ordered an additional cup of fruit coz it had more choice (berries melon peach kiwi ). The juice bar offers all kinds of fresh squeezed juices and smoothies.. which was such a wake me up... instant energy boost.

My husband thought his waffles(served with real maple syrup) were the best he ever had...couldn't agree more. We all got what we wanted..truly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The hype is real here. It's got a lot of reviews saying it's great. It's a super buzzing atmosphere and you get the feel of the restaurant.  

On the flip side, it tastes like something that I could put together at home and possibly taste better, which was a bit of a disappointment. I got yolk around the clock, I'm a yolk connoisseur so was disappointed to get half yolk egg almost over done. My potatoes, oh man. I really love potatoes, these were dry and unflavoured even though you could physically see rosemary on them.  I also had the smallest pieces of bacon in it.

I think it's a cool place to hang out but maybe there's more to the menu that I don't know about. 

Let's talk about service. The host was super welcoming and nice and then my server, I had a few, but my main one didn't even think to ask if I wanted water or anything and was left without water until I asked. He did check in with me later to ask if I was ok. It looks like they are trying to serve because it gets super busy.

Overall, come try it see what you think. It doesn't taste bad, it tastes ok, and the vibe is cool."}
{"text":"Premier brunch à Montréal alors pas de comparaison.
Mais un choix très très vaste sur la carte c'est même dur de se décider. 
Le service est agréable. Rien a redire. Je vous conseille un matin en semaine avant midi pour profiter du calme !
Honnêtement une fois que vous aurez fini votre assiette ne comptez pas manger avant le soir !
Pour commencer un jus d'orange frais pressé. Optez pour le régular et non le petit pour 50cts de plus pourquoi s'en priver !"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp when I was in Montreal. Wow, this place did not disappoint! They have everything! And they do it all amazing!

The decor in there was really cool. Very open, modern, and tables are nicely spaced apart. They have a downstairs and an upstairs. Ceiling high Windows that give you a great view of Montreal. 

Now, why we came here. The food!

My girlfriend and I ordered egg white omelettes each. Added chicken, spinach, and mushroom. Bomb!

Now why we really came here! The dessert...I mean pancakes and French toast! Carbs! 

We ordered:

The Banana Chocolate Waffle - Good, probably should have done this one that wasn't chocolate and banana lol

The Banana, Walnut, Chocolate chip pancakes - good! I love the walnut and Banana combo!

The S'mores Stuffed French toast - OMG....the best! Nutella and Marshmallow cooked inside of the French Toast..need I say more.

Great place! Will come back!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was decent. The pricing was a little surprising as I wasn't expecting breakfast can be that expensive. Most items were starting around 10 dollars. The hype is strong but two slices of toast, two eggs benedict, some potatoes,  cooked smoked salmon, and some fruit (grapefruit was bitter) can't be over 15 dollars. The smoked salmon can be expensive but everything else isn't."}
{"text":"The food quality was very poor. We asked for eggs over medium, they came too runny.After returning our plate the first time, they came back hard and had to wait for the 3rd egg to arrive separately almost 5 mins after.
Server showed no emotion or understanding, she was very robotic with no sense of service."}
{"text":"Best eggs benedict I have ever had.  Yummy, enormous cappuccino.  Great fast, fun, urban environment.  Good service.  Quick seating, even on a busy weekend morning.  If I lived in Montreal, I would eat here every Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"Since Eggspecation moved from yonge to bay, it took some of time to figure it out good and tasty breakfast place. I tried most of place and most of them ended up with disappointment. Whatsoever and they finally re-opened the restaurant. Obviously, the new location is better than the previous one, cause it has outside of area as well which you can sit and enjoy the good weather ( during the summer).

Quite frankly, I've been coming this place since the its opened and I did not see any negative stuffs about this restaurant. Restaurant has friendly staff, fast service and tasty food. Speaking of food, I only had breakfast here and can not comment for others stuffs that I did not even taste it. If you want to have nice breakfast based on eggs and French toast. Go for it.

Lastly, I'd like to enlighten people who are looking for review not just garbage of people. Majority of yelp users execute and revile the places unfairly due to experience that they had. People extremely get snarky on those sites, just because they can and get away with opposite opinion. I saw lots of good reviews about bad restaurants and lots of good review about good restaurants. Mostly about the the mistake that they did or slow service and extra charge for something. Get over it and stop the criticizing for one perspective by not regarding other factors."}
{"text":"I was conflicted. On one hand, I wanted an egg dish because of the restaurant's name. On the other, I was craving for authentic maple syrup. Fortunately, the waiter mentioned three suggestions: Sugar Shack (crepes), Eggstravaganza (French toast), or Eggsuberant (pancakes). I got the Sugar Shack with scrambled eggs and ham. 

Most people may not have poured all of the syrup. Not this guy. The crepes were a perfect compliment to the maple syrup. They were thin and moist. I could've eaten them with little to no syrup. Of course, that could be crazy talk. The scrambled eggs were plain and tasty. They didn't need any additional ingredients to be enjoyable.

The restaurant was definitely worth the commute from Yorkville.

I would caution folks about the potatoes. After I had one, I had to have another. And another. If I had continued, I would've been too full to finish all the crepes."}
{"text":"Eggspectation started in 1993 in Montreal and now has locations throughout Canada, a few in the US, India, and Dubai.  I wish we had a location in Austin, TX, as it would be my new favorite brunch spot.  They have more than just eggs, as this is a restaurant that can be experienced all day for breakfast, lunch, or dinner (thus why the menu is quite hefty). 

The restaurant is spacious, bright, and comfortable.  It's hard to select from the variety of breakfast options.  The one thing that is a must to try is their Lyonnaise style potatoes which are sautéed to a golden brown with caramelized onions, herbs, and other \"secret\" ingredients.  They are lightly crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and somewhat French fry like.  The Mykonos Omelette was pleasing to the eye and taste buds.  They have an onsite smoothie and juice bar, and also offer three different flavors of mimosas.  The fresh squeezed juice really makes the mimosas extra special.  They don't serve the mimosas until after 11:00am.  I am glad I ended my meal with an espresso, as there coffee was superb.  Overall an amazing breakfast and a great way to end our overnight in Toronto."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Eggspectation all the time when I was a student but thought it shut down when the Yonge Street location disappeared.  I was happy to discover it only moved one street over.  Eggs Benedict is my favourite breakfast meal so my friend and I shared the California Dreaming and the Smoked Salmon Benny.  Both dishes met my expectations and I like that you get a serving of fruit on the side.  For a Sunday morning, the wait wasn't too long like other trendy brunch places.  We only waited about 15 minutes and they text you if you feel like wandering outside for a bit."}
{"text":"Had a pretty decent brunch with my daughter here. Conveniently located in the Rockland mall.  Menu has a lot of choice.  She had the Mac and cheese and I had the veggie omelette.  Food was decent k but nothing exciting.  Service was friendly but we had to chase down our bill when it was time to leave."}
{"text":"The places one eats at solely for the purpose of convenience... it's a problem!  I was meeting up with a friend and Eggspectation was the chosen spot because it's not overly expensive and I assumed that eggs needed relatively little cooking time = perfect since us non-management staff are bound by whip and chains when it comes to our 1 hour lunch breaks!

I opted for the California Eggs Benny ($13.99) + an extra ($1.50 I think), if you want to swap for healthier options (fruit salad/mixed greens instead of potatoes).  So many things went wrong after we ordered.  

1.  My egg was more like a boiled egg as the yolk was not runny
2.  I thought blanching asparagus was a pretty basic thing to do, but apparently the cooks here throw in the asparagus, take a smoke break come back and then suddenly remember that they had asparagus cooking - the result - asparagus so pale and limp that it might as well be one of those noodles you used as a kid to float around in the pool.  Heck, THOSE might even be more firm.
3.  I specifically paid the extra money to NOT get potatoes on my plate.  What happens?  They bring me potatoes.

My friend opted for the Fish & Chips ($8.99?) which he seemed to enjoy.  I stole a few of his shoestring fries and they were pretty good, though lacking in colour, and very pale.

For lunch hour, this place was severely understaffed with only 1 server, 1 hostess and the manager running the show.  I know it's a greasy spoon, but that's no excuse for mediocre service and crappy food.  Even McDonald's has higher standards than this!"}
{"text":"The Bravacado version of eggs Benedict is a good option for gluten free folks. If you like avocado that is. The eggs and sauce sit upon half an avocado. I never considered that before but it was very tasty. I certainly miss my English muffins , but this is a great alternative.  Their menu does strive to provide healthy options. I found it a great way to start the day! Large pancakes came with my sons order of pancakes with scrambled eggs. The French Open happened to be on the TVs they have while we were there. A neat experience being in Montreal while attending the Formula One Grand Prix. I found Eggspectations while on Yelp searching for a cool breakfast place. Thanks again Yelp! The good reviews are right on the money!"}
{"text":"A staple in Montreal and a brunch favorite for every visit to the city. The Southwestern Omlette and Smores French Toast never disappoint. Just be prepared to wait in line if you arrive at peak times -- but it's worth every minute."}
{"text":"Came to egg spectation on a Sunday morning. Any brunch spots in Toronto on a weekend will definitely be busy. When we arrived we were quickly prompted with a ticket to help determine when we will be seated. Seating area is quite huge... Lots of tables, especially smaller tables so the turnover is semi quick. However I did have to wait 20 minutes for a 2 person table but I thought it was quite reasonable.

Servers are super prompt and friendly. Came for your attention quick and right off the bat asked whether we wanted anything to drink. I heard egg spectation was known for their smoothies but never had the chance to try them because it looked so huge! We opted just for water and proceeded to order our breakfast. Hubby ordered the classic breakfast (bacon, eggs, toast and home fries); I opted to try their savoury crepe. Mine was stuffed with two different types of cheese (mozzarella and Swiss I believe) and chicken breast and spinach. The taste was delicious! Our server said it was one of their fav to order and I was quite happy I ordered it because I enjoyed it a lot. Portion sizes are fair and it came with a side of salad. Prices are also very fair. Variety of breakfast/lunch items on the menu are also very good. Lots to choose from.

Will definitely be returning when wanting a casual breakfast spot"}
{"text":"In Montreal for this past weekend.  Came here two days this weekend.  Not a disappointment.  Coffee was awesome.  Had Montrealer omelette first day, Montrealer platter the 2nd.  No complaints.  Was seated in less than 10 mins on Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Food was good and there were a ton of options on the menu, but the service left something to be desired. However, they do service breakfast all day and I couldn't find anywhere else in the city that does that. Pancakes at 3pm=perfection."}
{"text":"We've been two weeks in a row and both times they've made mistakes on the same basic order. I can understand if I was making a complicated request but I ordered an a la carte bagel + cream cheese with a side of tomato, jalapeno and avocado. The menu clearly reads no substitutions and is why I ordered from their a la carte menu. While tomato, jalapeno and avocado are not listed as separate items, I would be fine with being charged for the extra ingredients. 

The first week, I received a bagel with salmon and capers. They got it right the second time. 

The second week, I and received an eggspectation bagel sandwich. They  took this back. About two minutes later, they came back with the same sandwich minus the eggs. There were still no avocados but it did come with lettuce and onions, neither of which I ordered. I can't confirm but I suspect the cook simply took the eggs off the sandwich and sent it back to the table. When I asked to correct the order, a woman, who I suspect was a team lead or manager came to the table to clarify. Later, a guy in a blazer, who again, may have been a team lead or manager dropped off the correct order. At no point did either of the managers inform us that my order was not permitted. Later the waitress, who in trying to manage this situation, came to the table and explained that they would allow this order this time but in future I would not be permitted to substitute ingredients. I explained that this was not a substitution and I ordered from their a la carte menu and I have no intentions of returning. She explained that these were instructions from management. She offered a discount and another smoothie and I declined both. I think they did discount the item on the bill. I explained to the waitress, it was unfair for her managers to make her explain the rules of ordering food at eggspectation. 

On a separate note - there have been a few posts online regarding the quality of their avocados. Check out the picture of the bruised avocado I was served. 

To summarize:
1. Poor vegetarian options
2. Staff have not been trained to accommodate basic requests
3. Management needs to be trained to speak to customers if there is an issue and not default to untrained servers if an issue needs to be resolved

Dear Eggspectation Management -  You've lost a customer because of unnecessary brunch drama and poor customer service over a basic  toasted bagel with cream cheese, tomato, avocado and jalapeno.

I was excited to have brunch location close to our area. It's unfortunate that poor customer service and management have limited this restaurant's potential. I think we'll stick to Fran's up the street which has a larger menu and is accommodating to basic requests."}
{"text":"No reason to waste a meal here if you're visiting Montreal for a few days. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that good. The place was filled with tourists (myself included) and the service was understandably indifferent. Felt like a wasted 2 hours."}
{"text":"The waitress was awesome. She was friendly and always refilled our coffee. When she noticed we were English she switched from speaking French to English. I give her 5 stars. 

The problem was that the food took a long time to come. I'm usually very patient, but the restaurant was almost empty. I don't mind waiting if they're in a rush, but I don't understand why it would take so long when there were hardly any orders. 

Also, I found it strange that they don't include coffee with the breakfast when all their competitors do. Especially at the price they are charging. I found that the price was too much for what you got."}
{"text":"For downtown where there are plenty of choices to eat, for me this one is a no brainer for breakfast.  They have choices, reasonable prices, a great selection while they have fast and friendly service.  

This restaurant is inside the Bell Trinity building ground floor at the south end of the building.  There are entrances through both the building lobby and from the Albert Street entrance directly across from Old City Hall.

There are plenty of selections on the menu in the form of you guessed it, eggs.  From omlettes to traditional breakfast to a variety of benedicts to choose you should be able to get what you're looking for.  

I went with a smoked salmon Benedict.  It was smoked salmon with capers, onions, poached eggs and with perfect Hollandaise all on top of toast instead of English muffins.  The tastes of all the ingredients went together perfectly.  The breakfast came a very generous serving of fruit which was a wonderful compliment to the savory dish.  

The fruit was a mix melons and berries and bananas.  I would definitely come back here to try many of the interesting items on the menu.

This place is perfect for breakfast in every way from great food to great coffee and quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast here twice during our long weekend in Montreal. We really liked the food and when we are back in town we will definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"You could say I had certain \"Eggspectations\" about being seated on time when asked to book a table through the NoWait app. We arrived when the app told us to but we still had to wait for a table when we got there. A rare misfire perhaps.All was forgiven when we got our food which was pretty dope. I had the pancakes with Canadian Maple Syrup and they slipped sausage in between each cake. Sensual."}
{"text":"A very lovely experience in eggspectation .. I've got a great lovely warm greetings from Andrea sweet smiley lady .. as I'm a new In the town and that my first experience in the restaurants it's and it's great . The place is a good choice for breakfast  I've enjoyed everything"}
{"text":"Fast and courteous service. The pancakes, French toast and the brioche were all fantastic. Coffee was good too!"}
{"text":"We've been in Montreal for 3 days and have come here for breakfast each day.  The food is excellent and the service is quick!! Our favorite waiter is Ranjan.  He is so funny and attentive!  We told him he's our favorite waiter in all of Montreal.  Can't wait to come back!! I always get The Fresh Start (pictured). It also comes with toast. So yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast food! Took my girlfriend here for Valentine's Day breakfast, was not disappointed. Very filling, not too pricey!"}
{"text":"I called in advance (pre-ordered) the High-Rise Pancakes during my lunch hour. I asked if I could substitute the bacon for something else since I don't eat meat. I opted for an extra sunny side egg. The service was impeccable at this place hands down but the food - The presentation wasn't pleasant. The pancakes were average. 

I used to come to this place a couple years ago and hands down had amazing food. They changed the location and I believe the menu too. 

This place has lost its touch."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after a crazy night of partying. Beer to help my headache? Yes please.

The omelettes here are dope and they all come with potatoes and fresh fruit. All the vegetables in my veggie omelette tasted fresh too.

The service here is lacking though. A group of 6 had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. If we weren't so tired and hungover we would've left right away. The service once seated was slow as well. Sure they were busy but you would think they would get it together for huge crowds on a weekend in such a busy strip.

The definite plus is that this place serves poutine for breakfast. Not the best in Montreal as you can go to La Banquise but still good to see."}
{"text":"We ate here 3 times on a 4 day bachelor party. The food was excellent. The smoothies, Bloody Caesars and mimosas to start really hit the spot. The dishes are large and every thing on the plate was delicious. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the High Rise Pancakes and was thoroughly satisfied. The food came out quickly and was delicious. The price is average for a nice breakfast place.

Our waiter was attentive and even helped us out with many of the tourist aspects of Montreal. The restaurant is very well decorated and feels very inviting.

Great food, great service - will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"With a name like \"eggspectation\", you really cannot afford to screw up an egg.

I ordered the Benedict and my eggs were overcooked and not runny out all. The appearance of it was spectacular, but definitely was not what I was \"eggspecting\". I am giving this a 3 star only because I looked the variation of fruit it came with."}
{"text":"How many eggs can you get for breakfast?  the answer is 4 eggs as normal at Eggspectation, majority of breakfast menu comes with 4 eggs....wow....I think this is too much."}
{"text":"A classic egg breakfast joint. We loved the American branches of Eggspectation and today we are breakfast in the home town of Eggspectation. What treat. Fabulous smoothies like Go Bananas. Great omelettes. Terrific Belgian waffles. Great meal!"}
{"text":"Guys! This food is freaking amazing! The wait can be long so definitely check in online first but it is totally worth is. The service was fast and friendly and the food came out surprisingly fast. You are kind of packed in there so if that's an issue, this isn't the place for you. I got the salted caramel waffles and my girlfriend got the lobster omelette and we both LOVED them. The next day we went back and got different things and were big fans again. The mimosas were fresh and good, the potatoes are sooo good and I don't even know why. Definitely worth the wait and we will be back on future trips to Toronto."}
{"text":"Huge portions for the price! I was pleasantly surprised when my breakfast came out, and the food was great. I especially loved the pancakes.

The décor/ambiance was nice, kind of trendy. And the staff was nice as well - could've been a little more attentive though. I'd definitely visit again."}
{"text":"As confirmed from my \"quick tip\" Yelp friend,  the French toast is the WAY to go here.   The girls at the table next to me had a little \"breakfast envy\" when this delicate platter finally arrived.  Don't expect speedy service, but ehey...it's Canada.  This a noisy atmosphere in this concrete floor place, but you get seated promptly, and the food is quality.
$15 excluding tip, for my French toast and a cappuccino isn't wonderful, but hey...it's Canada!!!!"}
{"text":"Probablement le pire café que j'ai bu. L'assiette qui m'a été servie était à moitié froide, j'ai du attendre éternellement pour payer la facture, la sauce hollandaise sur mes oeufs bénédictines était sans saveur et avait une texture désagréable et mon pain était froid."}
{"text":"Apparently one of the things about this place is that they serve a lot of fresh fruit with the meal. Having been here once, and shared 2 different things there, I have to agree that this is indeed accurate. Coming from the states, it's nice to see a massive heap of fresh fruit come with your meal as opposed to more potatoes, more buttered bread, or more bacon.

We got 2 things here, the first was one of the many versions of the eggs benedict they offer. As...eggspected...sorry...it was quite tasty. There were a of these offerings to chose from and I have to say that there were too many that it was hard to make any decision at all. In the end we went with 1 of the vast number that looked good and in the end it did not disappoint. 

The next dish was french toast loaded with fruit, lots of fruit. This was a great dish and of course the fruit made it really good. I normally don't get french toast for breakfast but I will admit that I do like it. This was a good choice, and I wouldn't hesitate to get it again if we went back here.

The espresso was decent, not amazing. I did get a second one but I'm not sure I should have. The service was ok but slow. And the price was maybe a hair on the high side. As a meal in-and-of-itself, it was good, I enjoyed it. Given a bit of slow service (to be fair we wanted to hit the road) and a bit of high price, it might suffer a hair on the overall grade. But it was a tasty meal and I imagine we may be back next time we're in the Old Port. 

Worth the trip overall."}
{"text":"Yeah, the name is corny but Eggspectations is a great breakfast destination.  The service was friendly and quick, the food was great and the location was convenient for lots of sight-seeing.  Apparently, there are multiple locations including a couple in the US (but down South).  Definitely would return."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now... and really, no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to order anything EXCEPT the egg-chilada! It's magically delicious with the kick of jalapenos and salsa... and the potatoes - oh the potatoes :) 

Egg-spectations is such a large space too, that it's great to have a group there - and no, they don't take reservations, but I was there on Saturday morning with a group of 10 people and we only waited 15 minutes (no too shabby!).

On a side note: I know that the usual beverage of choice at brunch is coffee - but you REALLY have to try the orange juice. Really. It's AMAZING."}
{"text":"A group of my friends wen there twice over this past weekend that's how much we enjoyed this place. I was a big fan of the decor and layout of the place. It had a very chill and modern feel to it. They have both french and english menus which was a bit confusing but we dealt with it. The first day I had a fruit smoothie which was great especially after a long night. I had the California scramble over a muffin and the presentation was great and flavor was decent. The next day I had fresh squeeze orange juice and the eggspectation omelet. It was a winner in my books very flavorful and refreshing. I would recommend this place to a couple or a group of friends. The only reason I didn't give the place 5 stars was because we waited a bit for food and the bathroom was not very clean."}
{"text":"My last visit was at least 6 months ago. 
Went in on a Saturday for some quick breakfast and their tittle always fascinated me, I am easily fascinated by clever restaurant names. 
The place was packed so we thought that was a good sign. Our order was alright, I think its pretty hard to mess up breakfast. However, we were turned off by the service. 
Maybe the fact that I haven't returned also lets you know about my feelings towards this place, it's a pass."}
{"text":"I went to this place because my friend had an eggs Benedict craving so it seemed logical. I wasn't that hungry so I was planning to just order something small. The restaurant itself was quite impressive with an old style, cool looking benches to sit in and an old school railing upstairs. I checked through the menu and the first page was smoothies (sweet!) I thought this place was looking good... I settled on a smoked wild sockeye salmon crustini with a banana java smoothie. The smoothie didn't taste like much... Could have used more sugar or anything else tasty in it but I guess I was expecting something more along the Jugo Juice level. When I got my crustinis I was disappointed before I even had a bite. You would think a crustini would be toasted... Apparently they don't. It was a sliced, limp piece of bland baguette bread with stuff piled on top. The salmon didn't taste smoked at all... It would have been so much better if the cucumbers had some sort of dressing on them to give them some taste also... Overall a very bland meal :( The staff was very nice though and service was quite quick."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. W went to Montreal for guys trip for two nights and i was going through yelp to find a good breakfast place to go to. Lol behold this comes up and it looked good and we decided to go there.

In the morning as we come out of hotel i get the address and start my location services on and the dot of current location and eggspectation location showing as one. confused and then found out it was right under the hotel in the corner of street.

Got in and had to wait around 20 minutes as it was a busy busy place. Seated down and looking at the menu, Lots of choices so we narrowed it down to only side of country fried potatoes, southwestern omelet, house special omelet, pancakes, french toast with scrambled egg, breakfast bagel BLT sandwich and Poutine between the four of us. Oh wait i forget the fresh juices.

Man the food was awesome and so much we were ready to sit our asses in the chair for like 2 hours. Poutine was really nice with good gravy. Omelets were very nice and the country fried potatoes were great.

overall we loved it and had the best meal in Montreal."}
{"text":"It was ok. Basically expensive diner food. We went our first morning in Montreal. Once was enough. It wasn't bad, but I'm not dying to try it again."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my family. The menu is full of egg puns. Nevertheless they do have a fruit salad plate which is vegan. Fruits are fresh, colorful, and very filling. Display is a work of art! Booths are comfy. Staff is friendly and very accommodating. I wish they had more vegan friendly options like tofu scrambles. Feel free to order toasts / potatoes with no butter. Coffee is bottomless."}
{"text":"I really like the non-fat greek yogurt with fruit and honey you add with your favorite. Mr. Tang said his order is also good."}
{"text":"Great food and perfect location! I came here with my husband, mother and 10 month old son and our experience was great. There was a parking lot right across the street and it's family friendly which is another plus. I had the bagel with lox and cream cheese, my mom had the French toast with eggs and sausages, and my husband had the Lobster Benny and we ordered Blueberry pancakes to share. Everything was exceptional and delicious. I definitely would come back when I'm in Montreal because I'm sure the quality won't be the same in the states!"}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened in this location if the management has changed perhaps but our experience today didn't in any way reflect the brunches I've had here in the past. The food was cold and tasted funky. It took the waiter over 30 mins to take our orders and 15 minutes to bring us filter coffee. To be fair he looked swamped, like he was the only waiter on the second floor for approximately 20 tables. 
My friends salmon Benedictines were served entirely cold, eggs, salmon and hollandaise included. We laughed about this perhaps being their \"take\" on a classic brunch offering. 
I ordered a 10 dollar fruit and yogurt parfait and the fruit on it was obviously old: strawberrries purple and soggy. 
The poor waiter did everything in his power to get absolutely no tip. He brought us the bills and then waited 30 mins to come back with the card machine to get us to pay. 
I felt really bad for him but the overall experience was awful. 
Will think twice before going back"}
{"text":"Brunch is HUGE in Montreal. It seems that people just can't get enough of it - I love brunch too, so my friends and I were brave enough to line up at Eggspectation last weekend. We were lucky to arrive right before the bulk of the crowd showed up, so we got seats after about 20 minutes. It's not my first time at this restaurant (more like the third). I used to like it. The fruits were fresh and sweet, and the presentation beautiful. This time, everything seemed to be a rushed, cheaper version of itself (check my photos for a comparison of before and now). I understand that the plates were prepared in the heat of the rush hour, but it shouldn't be an excuse to serve sub-par food. It felt like eating at a cafeteria. 

Two of my friends had lukewarm benedict eggs, another found eggshells in her food. The bread was regular supermarket bread. The fruits were unripe and tasted like they were prepared the night before. The café au lait was mostly milk. The service was fast and good, but the food lacked in so many aspects that the overall experience was very average. At least my friend got her coffee for free in apology for the eggshells.

As we left, I stared in disbelief at the line of hungry customers that kept growing past the door and onto the sidewalk. Not worth the wait, really.

Avoid at rush hours!"}
{"text":"I just moved in the area. I went to try it out, the food tasted great but I got really sick a few hours later. My friend who was with me also felt bad.

Spoke to my neighbor about it and he told me he also got sick after eating there on a previous occasion. Not good..."}
{"text":"So I've been Toronto a lot and never been to this place. So thank you Yelp for pointing out just how great this place was. I ate there not once, but twice. Now passport Derek doesn't eat like he use to eat, but breakfast is important to my new metabolic self. That said on the 2nd day I actually ordered two full breakfasts. One was the South West and the other French Toast, I mean this is Canada, albeit not Montreal and I didn't hear French once I don't think?! Anyways, 4 people, 1 adult and 3 very hungry 16-18 year old teenagers who ordered fresh juices and meals $100 bucks Canadian which is like $10 American, but seriously worth every penny. If you are cheap go eat at Tim Horton's you savage. If you want a clean, hipster type place that bangs out a lot of good food, then get here. It's near Toronto city hall and the Toronto sign and Mall....

{"text":"I love the Eggspecation restaurant chain so of course the Bay Street Toronto location met my Eggspectation!  Eggs all day what more can u ask for. The food was eggcelent as always!! 

We arrived around 9am and was seated by the greeter promptly. It was a gorgeous day weather wise so we dined outdoors. Out server had both inside and outdoor tables to tend to but he was always in earshot when we needed something. They do pretty good with having  food delivered to the tables efficiently!! 

I had the French toast with ham and eggs - came with fresh fruit and sliced potatoes - very filling! My eggs, over medium, were perfect! 

I had a taste for the CrabCake Benny - they had the Lobster Benny on the menu instead - No biggie. And some may complain about the parking - which is no fault of the restaurant's. 
Its in a great location to people watch with the mall and phillip square, and even the court services surrounding it."}
{"text":"Usually I get just average service. Once, i saw  The hostess wearing sweats and a hoodie. She looked tired and left her post for a good 4-5 minutes.  Not presentable at all. . But i went with my boyfriend last month and we received the most unprofessional service in our whole restaurant eating career. Our waitress was talking bad behind my boyfriend's back while he was in the bathroom. Not only that but she rushed him while he was deciding what to eat. We understand it's busy and it may be stressful, but you are still the waitress and you are still supposed to be providing a service. There are no excuses. We were kind enough not to complain to the manager, but we did not tip. Would not go there AGAIN."}
{"text":"Great menu. Good drinks. A little noisy, especially when there are big groups but that's ok. They are happy. We returned our second gay in town and enjoyed the restaurant just as much."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for bunch, or lunch had the \"eggstravaganza\" and it was amazing! Everything is priced very well, the service is good as well as very inviting layout. Definitely will be going here again!"}
{"text":"The typical telling signs were a bit misleading here. Yes, the restaurant was empty despite it being lunchtime in a very busy area. But the staff was friendly and attentive and the food was fine. Well, more than fine. It was quite good, in fact. 

The menu remains as extensive as ever--generally a bad sign that hints to the likelihood of a kind of sameness throughout all their dishes--but the eggs benedict we ordered on that particular day were lovely. The hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy... my heart hurt a bit afterwards thus testifying to the quality of that sauce. The eggs were prepared just as requested (medium for my companion and runny for me). Other than the fact that the potatoes were a bit bland, everything was generally quite good."}
{"text":"Last day in Montréal so we headed out at sunrise for a last breakfast.  We picked this location based on yelp reviews & were delighted w/ the selection & the food!  

Service was fast & attentive.  The menu selection was vast & the choices were hard as it all sounded good!  I wish we lived closer as I could come back a dozen times & not get the same thing!  

The portions were plentiful & the quality of the food was excellent!!  The scrambled eggs were fluffy, the sausage was perfectly cooked & the flavor of the meats was Delish!  The brioche French toast & the real maple syrup was the finishing touch!   Well done Eggspectations!!"}
{"text":"Updated Review....this morning we went there and I ordered scrambled eggs. I got fried eggs. I sent them back, They returned it and all they had done is cut up the fried eggs and called them scrambled. Not impressed. I sent them back again and the server complained about me to the manager from 5 feet away."}
{"text":"We came here for a late brunch. Our server was very nice. We ordered the high-rise breakfast (pancakes with bacon and sausages in the middle), and an American breakfast. They both tasted good - nothing mind-blowing, but it was still good. The fruits looked very fresh, but didn't taste that way - it might have been because we showed up at the end of the day. Ultimately, I would recommend this place since it has lots of seating, with a nice ambience!"}
{"text":"We went to Eggspectation to have a lunch, and we try blackstone eggs and eggsuberant. The both was so delicious, and the price is not too much, good quality price."}
{"text":"Great for families and kids!  Now traveling with kids is difficult but finding places to eat with them is even harder especially if you have a picky eater on your hands.  Has a separate kids menu with crayons so my picky eater was entertained and had her pancakes with bacon.  I enjoyed my pancakes and eggs with potatoes and bacon.  Also had small portion of fruit on the side.  Husband is not much of a breakfast eater so he went with the burger which he stated it was one of the best burgers he has had.  My 6 month old sat in a high chair slapping the table being slightly noisy but it was ok cause the place was a little loud from all the people.  The waiter was terrific in helping us understand the menu since we did not understand french."}
{"text":"This is definitely a must have when you are in Toronto.  The California Egg Benedict with asparagus, salmon and home fries was absolutely very very good.  The service was fair, quick to serve but a bit slow for check.  Overall I give this thumbs up."}
{"text":"The menu is very enticing, but I ordered the bagel and lox and was seriously disappointed...the onions were at least a day old...dried out and chewy...the bagel seemed a tad stale, and maybe it's just me, but I've never had the bagel cut into 4 pieces....let alone when you are trying to put large onion slices, salmon and capers on it.  My wife had the Eggs Benedict California and said it was  \"just okay\".  This was the first place we tried for breakfast in Montreal and will not return again.  Atmosphere was nothing special, something like a fancier diner...kitchen right in the main first floor area was a bit noisy..."}
{"text":"Top notch service! Plenty of seating. Large variety of brunch items. Personally I had the Smoked Salmon Egg Benedict w/ Fruits. Thought it was ok and didn't really wow me that much. Parking can be an issue; all underground lots (across and beside)."}
{"text":"Breakfast here was a must for our recent trip to Toronto!
The menu is vast and all looks amazing! 
I had the Classic Eggs Benedict and it was definitely one of the best I have ever had!
Also ordered one of their fresh juices and it was incredible! Others in our group also ordered different juices and loved them.
My friend ordered the High Rise Pancakes and it looked amazing! Egg-hashbrowns-pancake-bacon-pancake-sausage-pancake! 
My wife is gluten free and they were very accommodating! She asked for the Eggs Benedict with extra avocado instead of the English muffin and they gave her huge avocado with beautiful presentation. 
Very impressed! Would definitely eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Brunch at Eggspectation is always something exciting for me. 
Great place for brunch in the heart of downtown. 
I really liked their menu & the way it gave eggilicious twist to everything. I am kind of a fan of their lobster omelette and smoothies. Special mention about Their lobster mac and cheese. Those are to die for."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast. Wasn't spectacular, but definitely filling and hits the spot. I asked for a latte which wasn't listed on the menu.. but figured since they have espresso it would have been fine. I guess they didn't hear correctly because they gave me a cup of cafe au lait. This was okay, nothing amazing, I've definitely had better coffee. 

I ordered the southwest omelette which is filled with three types of cheese and topped with sour cream, salsa, and avocado. I actually expected more flavor from this omelette. It wasn't bad, but I do feel it lacked some flavor. The potatoes were definitely plain and kind of dry, nothing tabasco and ketchup didn't fix though. We had the salted caramel strawberry waffles to share for the table, this was pretty good, remember to eat them fresh, not as good after they've cooled down and become soggy. My friends who ordered the Eggspectation omelette, and eggs benedict said their food was t bad, but nothing special either.

The price was okay, came out to $92? for 4 breakfast entrees. We came on a Tuesday morning, service was quick and it wasn't crowded. I'd imagine it to be much more crowded on the weekends though."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast, I ordered an omelet. The smoothie was good and so was the coffee. They have a large menu and great service. Solid place, you will be full and happy, but its not out of this world. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Wrong order times 3. Slow. Cheap. Bad presentation. Tastes bland. Where do I begin? I miss their old location and management on yonge street. That was a tightly run ship."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent and service was up to par. The steak was well moist and tender. The wife couldn't get enough of her eggs benedict. Overall a great eggspectation for breakfast."}
{"text":"I... Honestly forget what I ordered. But it was good! And my brunch mates ordered various eggs benedicts and they absolutely loved it. It's a good spot."}
{"text":"had to hit this place back up on grand prix weekend.  nothing like a good breakfast after a night of champagne, vodka and dancing on tables until the ugly lights come on at 3:00 a.m.

this time around, i had the yolk around the clock - cut a bagel in half, grill it, drop a sunny side up egg into each hole [insert sexual innuendo here] cover it with bacon and cheddar, eat it, and you will feel like a man again.  top it off with a glass of the fresh-squeezed oj and you will be ready for night #2.

on a practical note, it looks like they added some outdoor seating since the last time i was here."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast/lunch place I've been to in Toronto. The menu has a lot of variety, the food is delicious and decently priced. Very very busy place, use the yelp app to avoid the line, it really helps."}
{"text":"We found this place on our travels the day before and thought that it would be a great place to try for breakfast. And it was delicious. The cafe au lait was wonderful, recommend getting the 'bowl' if you are a coffee fan. It's worth the treat. We both got eggs with quinoa that was prepared better than most. The fruit that came on the side was fresh. It's definitely worth going back to for breakfast or maybe lunch."}
{"text":"First and only day in this beautiful city and I yelp and found this GEM. We decided to eat inside instead of their outside sitting. The decor is so much nicer than just starting at a bldg front. The server was great and very attentive.

I ordered the UNEGGSPECTED! Steak and eggs baby."}
{"text":"Toronto, please step up your brunch game. This is embarrassing.

Eggspectation is a Montreal-based brunch spot, so I figured that it should be decent... *Donald Trump voice* WRONG. Toronto, why you gotta be like this? 

A quick glance at the menu shows some good stuff with some decent prices. But once you actually get the food, you can't help but feel cheated. The portions are really small. Listen, let's do some basic math: breakfast + lunch = brunch. A proper brunch is the equivalent of 1.5-2 meals. Generally, when I have brunch, I expect to not have to eat lunch later, because I'll still be full from before. 

I came in with high expectations. Left sad and still hungry.

Also, I'm 90% sure the Eggspectations in Montreal give more food (will have to double check when I go back)."}
{"text":"Over-priced breakfast that isn't even that good.  Otherwise, great location."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Located in the middle of downtown Toronto we grabbed a great breakfast here and then walked all over to see the sights. Super fresh food which makes you feel great after a long flight. Orange juice is squeezed in house. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Disappointing compared to previous visit 2 years ago. Came for my birthday brunch. Ordered a side of Hollandaise which had curdled. Cutlery was dirty, was never given/offered a hot water refill for my tea and the waitress answer to \"our ketchup bottle leaked all over our table, clothes and food\" was \"can I bring you another bottle?\" We had to ask for extra napkins. She was courteous but clearly inexperienced. Note to management, your patio tables and chairs are nice but the tables are too high for your chairs. I'm tall and still felt awkward trying to eat. Would take much convincing to return."}
{"text":"I'd 100% recommend going here. Our server's name was Nadine and she was extremely nice and amazing! Super fast and always checked on us.

I got the Uneggspectation which was steak with eggs. I got poached eggs and white bread. 100% percent delicious and came with some fresh fruit. The food was great and worth every bite. I asked Nadine for some steak sauce and she brought me the steak sauce + 4 other hot sauces in case I wanted it! 

I would definitely come back when I visit Montréal!

On a side note they have free wifi!"}
{"text":"Eggspectation was an eggcelent choice for my breakfast. The atmosphere was a bit noise but staff was very friendly and attentive. They have an upstairs and downstairs area, a huge bar and a nice terrace on Rue St. Catherine (but it was too cold to sit outside). 
The menue is huge what makes the decision very hard. 
I would definitely come back next time."}
{"text":"Tantôt l'allure trop droite d'une franchise, tantôt Eggspectation s'exprime chaleureux son fibre d'un resto du coin. La nature du menu se confirme au plus textuel possible. Mon assiette 'Le Classique' est bien, rien de plus. Un défaut. Servir des avocats, qu'ils soient peu ou prou, le plus mure possible est meilleur en bouche. Lorsque l'avocat en tranche demande à être croquée davantage que le pain, euh..."}
{"text":"It's anchored at the bottom level of the Rockland shopping mall. We both had 'Le Classique' breakfast dish. Eggs, toasts, home fries, baked beans and a side of cured meat. I intended a more befitted story to tell but it is what you would EGGspect."}
{"text":"Such a large brunch restaurant is a rare sight in the downtown core. This place has plenty of tables, but you can still expect to have to wait for a table on a weekend afternoon. 

The food here is mediocre. The salmon eggs benny was underwhelming; the hollandaise sauce was too viscous, and the bread is the standard run of the mill whole wheat toast. You can definitely find better brunch spots farther down on queen street or near yorkville. 

However, if you're in the area and don't want to walk far to satisfy your brunch craving, then this place isn't the worst place to eat."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time during my trip to Toronto. It is a great place for breakfast, but quite eggspensive.
The waitress was great, very friendly. The place hit quite crowded and then it gets quite loud in the restaurant.
I would definitely recommend that place to someone coming to Toronto and looking for a good spot to enjoy breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel down the street and went over here for breakfast. I was alone so the atmosphere kind of sucked but it would definitely be fantastic for a breakfast date or brunch with friends. My dish was amazing and way more filling than I expected it to be. The fruit was so fresh and the potatoes were delicious. I would definitely go back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was absolutely great! Food is great, ambience is great, waitresses are nice and friendly. If you can't speak French, no worries they can speak English."}
{"text":"Good stuff, nice location and service... A little bit different from others. Like the interior design. Will back soon for sure to try other delicious food."}
{"text":"Try southwest omelette.. Good service.. very nice location. they know how to treat the customers."}
{"text":"I agree with most everyone else.  The breakfast here is excellent.  We ate here twice during our stay in Montreal.  We had a group of 4 and ordered a variety of food.  It was all fresh and flavorful.  The wait staff was very friendly and they were also accommodating to special requests.  We would definitely eat here again if ever in the area."}
{"text":"So delicious, coming from the US I was having a weird time adjusting to food differences but Eggspectation was great. Beautiful place for me and my family to have a nice brunch. The staff was amazing and so kind. Highly recommend!! Great location as well, caught it on our way to the Picasso museum."}
{"text":"Excelente!!! Huevos San Benedictos, Salmon y las tostadas francesas con frutas y licor triple sec, espectacular!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning and waited 2 hours for a table!! 
After finally seeing the big menu I decide to go for a classic salmon and Cream cheese bagel, which was good but not worth $16.
My friends ordered the pancakes and the eggs Benedict and it looked way yummier than mine.
Probably going back for the bennies, NOT ON A SUNDAY MORNING"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast option in Montreal. I had the veggie omelette, fruit, and wheat toast. All of the food was fantastic. I ordered iced tea initially, but it was too sweet. The kind waiter suggested their fresh-squeezed orange juice instead. It was fantastic."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. A wheelchair can navigate its entrance. We love eggs. The menu os pretty extensive and they serve the best variations on eggs Benedict. They have salads and bugers. Reasonably priced. Casual. Busy but not awful. Always likeable staff. Been here a dozen times over 10 years. Its our go to when we are hungry and don't feel like fancy or junky food"}
{"text":"Good quantity delicious fluffy french toast fresh fruits  and juices. Enjoyed the place. The price is definitely high but quantity is plenty."}
{"text":"This was by far, the best overall breakfast experience I've had in my entire life. Not only was the main part of my meal, the omelette, perfectly cooked, seasoned and assembled, the fresh side of fruit was perfectly ripe, juicy and delicious! The service was just as good as the food, quick, friendly and observant- especially with coffee refills. I will recommend this place to everyone I know and I will definitely be making another trip back here when I'm in town"}
{"text":"Major disappointment. Went here for breakfast on a Sunday and the place was pretty much dead. A telling sign. Eggs were eh and nothing really stood out. Even the service was blech for an empty restaurant. You can probably get a better breakfast at Tim's."}
{"text":"BY FAR, the best breakfast place in the world! Best quality food. Eggs were eggxellect! No choice with eggs will be a disappointment. 

Also, what a treat it is to be on Yonge Street. Yo, sickest street in the world, eh?"}
{"text":"This would have been a five star review... except there was an eggshell in my meal! I really loved everything else but I'm sorry this is just unacceptable. I got the Montreal Benny, and the presentation was great, really nice that it came with fruit. The potatoes were absolutely delicious! I've never had Montreal smoked meat before and it was really good."}
{"text":"Eggspectation exceeded my eggspectations.  We came in not knowing what to eggspect.  Once the eggs and pancakes came out, we took pictures right away.  And then proceeded to devour it away since we were hungry from riding the megabus for 12 hours.  Right away, we were blown away.  Everything was top-notch.  Customer service was top-notch and everyone can learn from the waiter.  He refilled our water without us asking, which is plus 3 bonus stars in my book.  The breakfast itself was very filling.  This is a great spot to come to when arriving to Toronto, or even for locals to eat at."}
{"text":"It was packed full at 10am on a Sat morning, maybe because there was the Santa parade that was going on, but it was very busy that morning. Overall, the food is good, flavors are well executed, but I was disappointed by how little Lyonnaise potatoes were on my plate.  C'mon breakfast people, I waited in line and paid $13 for this dish, at least a few more of those tasty taters would be nice!  The ambiance is great and has a unique feel to it. They don't take reservations on the weekends so if you're a large group that might take a bit of waiting. I ordered the Eggs Florentine and their hollandaise sauce is pretty good, and seeing how many people were eating there, I'm sure it was fresh.  Beverages aren't included, so depending on what you get it's an additional $2-6 to your bill. It's not breakfast on a dime I'll tell you, but it's not bad for breakfast fare. Remember that it's a breakfast chain, so things are standardized so to speak.  Apparently they have a dinner menu, but they're only open until 5pm. Either way, it's reliable and a good type of restaurant to visit if you know what you eggspect (pun intended!) for your meal."}
{"text":"We visited Eggspectations twice on during our trip to Montreal.  We would have gone every morning if we could have, it was that good. It was recommended in the Montreal guide I had purchased. Great tasting food, great presentation, very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here. Our server, Sophie was awesome, friendly and very efficient. The food was delicious, with a large selection. Try the Bloody Mary - great way to start the day

Edit: We liked this place so much, we came back a second day. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Having flown in to Buffalo, NY in the wee hours of the morning and having nothing to eat during the two hour drive into Toronto, we stopped by this place while browsing the Eaton Centre for some brunch/lunch. The name of this place led me to believe every dish will have some form of the incredible egg incorporated into it. Not quite, but I ended up ordering a traditional dish that normally has an egg in it -- the ham and mushroom omelet. They didn't skimp on the ham and mushroom and the portion of grilled potatoes was decent, but overall the omelet itself was okay and didn't quite hit the spot. I feel the omelet from my college dining hall tasted better. Eggspectation not met. =/"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, even better staff and service. Tried the Pagè, and Eggsuberant. Phenomenal! Definitely on the revisit list when in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast this morning with my hubby and two year old. It was a fantastic visit! The service was polite and friendly, also SUPER fast!! He greeted us within moments of sitting, brought our drinks quickly, meals came very fast after ordering, and receiving & paying our check was easy and fast as well. My experience with service in the city has been underwhelming, so this was a welcomed surprise. 
The food was fan-freaking-tastic, by the way. I had a delicious smoothie and the lobster eggs Benedict. I could live on this stuff!! The potatoes were crispy and the fresh fruit was generously cut and very fresh. 
My hubby had one of the smoked salmon Benedict plates and he loved it. They kids menu was diverse and very well priced. My little one had a plate that she just loved. Eggs, pancake, strawberries and bacon plus a glass of fresh oj she barely made a dent in the food, but she loved taking bites of one thing then the next. 
I would totally come back here and highly recommend it to families with kids."}
{"text":"Massive menu.  Average food.  The downtown space has a great industrial feel with exposed brick walls, unfinished concrete floors, and open duct work.  The menu is more than a dozen pages of every imaginable incarnation of eggs, as well as other option for breakfast and brunch.  I ordered the classic eggs benedict.  It was classic, pedestrian, and nothing special.  The potatoes that are praised as a specialty of the house were cooked with onions and herbs, but were dry and not cooked enough.  I am not a big fan of restaurants that sprout multiple locations and franchise.  With two locations in Montreal and a desire to expand, it feels corporate and formulaic.  Expect a good reliable breakfast but not a great one."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go if you're a timid American and just need something that looks like home.  I don't mean that in a negative way, the food was delicious, and the servings were generous.  It's just more of an American style restaurant.  I had eggs, 'brown bread' (toast), and bacon.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"This was a delicious little breakfast spot that opens early. I ate here around 6:30am before my big immigration interview at the consulate at 8am. It was an excellent meal and the relaxing atmosphere really calmed my nerves. I was so nervous I ate pretty quickly and don't remember too much. I had this thing with a bagel with melted swiss cheese and an egg in the middle on one side, and another cheese on the other half of the bagel. All I know is it was good."}
{"text":"I go to Toronto few times a year and I for some reason don't really get breakfast or brunch at places. I usually just get Timmy Ho's. Super glad I made the decision the go here. 

Food: So much to choose from, so if you're indecisive like me--make sure to grab a menu if you are waiting for a table. Our waiter gave a suggestion for me, the Southwest Sunrise omelette. It had these perfect slices of avocado on them and the omelette had cheese inside it. CHEESE. Not going to lie, it was the best omelette I've had in a while, going to start eating my omelettes with salsa more often. The potatoes were delicious as well. For the drank, I got the Page smoothie, highly recommend that if you like fruity smoothies. 

Cool vibes in there, nice interior. Loved the oldies playlist! 

This place gets busy, so be prepared to wait if you are showing up, luckily Eaton Centre is right there so you can kill time by going shopping. Would've gave 5 stars but for some reason my name got skipped, so I ended up waiting for over a hour...even the waiter noticed that I was waiting for a long time. Going to try it next time I'm in TO, def a fan!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Omlettes looked great. Their potatoes werr great...sautéed i think. Bloody mary was fresh tomatoe juice. Orange juice was fresh and lovely.
Manh many eggs Benedicts...looked great.
Smoked meat in my omlette was a good addition.
Recommended for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for breakfast/brunch. The service was on point with our waitress constantly refilling the coffee. I don't think our cups ever got below the half way point. Is recommended doing reservations just in case. There might be a wait during busier times, considering the location. 

I ordered the Eggsuberant. I thought it was a good amount of food for the price. I thought it was okay overall. I probably would consider ordering the eggs Benedict if I return."}
{"text":"Food's good... BUT service was meh and food is definietly not consistent. 

They have a ton of different delicious looking options here. My boyfriend and I got the:
Bravacado Benedict - OK.... dude... compared to the table sitting next to us.... we got no potatoes. I'm so sad because I love potatoes and you know, consistency is key. And our fruit pieces were also tiny compared to the ones of the tables next to us. Also, one of the avocados they used was SOOOO hard. Not ripe at all, but the other one was perfectly ripe. Like c'mon.. how hard is it to feel the avocado a bit and keep that consistent. Eating a non-ripe/not ready avocado is just not yummy.
Smoked Salmon Benedict - This was fine, but not amazing. Came with the fruit side instead of potatoes, but you can switch it to potatoes without incurring any additional costs.

Really wanted to love this place, but honestly would rather go get brunch somewhere else if I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've visited many Eggspectations locations in Ottawa and Montreal and I can't find a single fault with this one in Downtown Toronto. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and our visit for Saturday brunch was a real pleasure.

The staff were friendly and even though the restaurant was rather busy we were seated right away.

We were brought water almost immediately however I also ordered a latte which rivalled that of many coffee places. It was really good!

The waiter was more than happy to accommodate my groups diet requirements. I ordered a Mexico inspired omelette which had salsa, veggies and sour cream. It came with the signature potatoes and a small selection of fruit as an included side. Overall it was delicious and expertly cooked. The rest of my group enjoyed their breakfasts too.

Even though the restaurant was busy the waiter was really attentive and came to check we were ok which although is nothing out of the ordinary was appreciated none the less.

Next time I'm in Toronto and am getting brunch I will almost certainly return here."}
{"text":"I was expecting a breakfast of a higher quality than what I got, (since they apparently specialize in breakfast). 

While the service and ambiance were excellent, the sausage and pancakes on my plate were lukewarm, as though they had been sitting in a food warmer for some time. Pancakes and sausage should be cooked to order. The cakes were not at all fluffy, and somewhat undercooked, as well.

Nice they have a bar, so you can enjoy a sparkling wine with your meal though."}
{"text":"Delicious, and fast! This is my favorite breakfast restaurant.  I saw the lunch menu today and some of the dishes being served.  Maybe soon to be my favorite lunch spot also."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in the heart of Old Montreal. Closest place to a diner that I found. Very friendly service as well."}
{"text":"My partner and I took the plunge on this place because of the history. MTL is known to have a Eggspectation...So, he ordered a form of Benedict while I ordered their Banana Wallnut Pancakes. His stuff was all great but the pineapple they gave him was not ripe enough to serve. Our smoothies were pretty good but they could have gone for another round in the blender...I would recommend the one I had: Go Bananas. In regards to my pancakes, they're okay. I found that the there wasn't as much wallnuts are i'd hope for and too much Banana."}
{"text":"This place gets two thumbs up from me. They have a great selection of breakfast and brunch items. I didn't pay much attention to the lunch and dinner items but they were there. 
The server was able to switch seamlessly from French to English to accommodate guests like myself that try. She was very attentive (except to my American need to drink lots of iced water) and very pleasant. 
I ordered the wrap to eat in house and ordered another 3 meals to go. For those that haven't traveled abroad, service in restaurants outside the US does tend to be a bit slower. Deal with it. 
The menu sticks to the \"eggs\" theme so most of the dishes start with \"eggs...\" i.e., eggstravaganza. My meal was delicious. The items were simple, but the flavors were very complex. My to go orders were a waffle with fruit, some \"eggsalent\" traditional breakfast with pancakes, bacon, potatoes and fruit, and the Lobster Benny. If you're an eggs Benedict fan, you'll love it. I deplore runny eggs and I even appreciated the flavor. I hesitate to review take out meals because I know that there is some diminishing if most foods in transport. This food; however, held up relatively well. (The food that I ate there was outstanding). 
There are at least 3 locations around the city. It's a bit pricey, but well worth it."}
{"text":"We came here when they had first opened several months ago and had a terrible experience. We were anticipating the opening and left very disappointed. 
Today we decided to try again and see if it had improved. It absolutely has. They are making a concerted effort to improve their service and it really shows. Food was really good, as much as a classic breakfast place can be and the place is spotless. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"While in Montreal we were in the mood for a nice traditional breakfast and saw the reviews on Yelp so decided on eggspectation. Once we were inside we realized this was a chain restaurant, but the food did not disappoint. I decided on the bravvocado and holy shizah this was a great meal! I don't even care much. For avocado but loved this. The only \"bad thing\" about eggspectation was that they did not offer soy milk as an option."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff! Every meal comes with fruit I believe, which is great. They have a wide variety of meals, which are all very filling. Only if you don't like eggs this might not be a good idea :)"}
{"text":"Ok. I didn't want to do this but I am going to. The food here is good but the service is just terrible. I mean we are talking about breakfast food. How hard and how long does that take? There is no reason you should have a 30 minute wait for your food to come out of the kitchen after putting an order in. Yes, I said 30 minutes. Beyond ridiculous. And to make matters worse...Nick the manager was completely unapologetic about it. He rather chose to be defense and say he couldn't control what was happening in the kitchen. You shouldn't be a manager if thats your response."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast before going to shop at the Eaton Centre, first we were pleasantly greeted by a very nice hostesses with a British/Australian accent (not sure). Next we were quickly seated despite it being packed, i ordered the s'mores french toast and my girlfriend ordered the eggstravaganza platter. Food came out fast and was delicious. The french toast was amazing with the s'mores topping and just by itself. Eggs and bacon were also very good. To drink we had fresh grapefruit juice which was refreshing and i had the banana java smoothie which was delicious. This place is a great way to start your day, i highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This was near our place we stayed and we felt so lucky for that. this definitely beat any breakfast place I've been to. there were so many phenomenal sounding breakfast dishes. I had a breakfast crepe with eggs, hollandaise sauce, mushrooms, spinach and three types of cheeses. It came with a fresh, delicious side salad. I told myself any time we go back to Montreal, this will be our first place to go to!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here for brunch while staying in Toronto for the weekend. The atmosphere of this place was awesome, very nice urban design with a warm feeling. We started off with pickled caesars to drink and they were great. The garnish was a great touch. Our food came out very fast despite the place being so busy. My fiancé ordered a BLT type Benedict with avocado and I ordered the lobster benny. Both came with crunchy and flavorful potatoes. I did take one star off because I didn't really get much lobster meat for the price but it was still very good! Service was excellent and our waiter was very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! I came here during my lunch break with a few friends and it was delicious. I ordered a veggie omelette with a side of potatoes and fruit for about $13. The food was great, but definitely overpriced. The location downtown right beside the eaton centre makes up for the price. The patio is a great place to eat on a summer day."}
{"text":"Had a great time for brunch! Sat up at the bar to watch the golf tournament but still had excellent service! The fresh squeezed grapefruit and orange juice were perfect for some delicious mimosas. Had the southwest sunrise omelet which was delicious. Definitely a good go-to spot for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"For those of us who actually enjoy breakfast, will love this spot! I've personally never had a complaint. The staff is incredible and super on point with service. The food is ALWAYS hot and fresh and very quick. I mean I usually come here for breakfast, however they do have a lunch menu as well. Although I've only tried a handful of items on the menu, my experience here is always at its best!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast, the most important meal of the day! Breakfast can make all the difference between me being a cranky witch and me being the normal, cheery self that I am. It's hard to find a good breakfast place in the city (though timmies isn't too shabby), which is weird because it ain't that hard to prepare breakfast in the first place.

After going to Eggspectations, I stand by my previous comment, it's slam hard to find good brekkie in the city! This restaurant is the cutest thing, just look at their logo or their menu! I'm a woman of habit and I ordered their pancakes. Meh, I've had better. In fact, I've made better! They weren't horrible, it's hard to do horrible pancakes, unless they are raw battery on the inside, OR they are charred! They were neither at Eggspectations, but just not great! 

I had great eggspectations for this place, and was sourly disappointed! Go to the food network and look up some breakfast recipes. It's really not that difficult to make and will taste so much better than mediocre food here."}
{"text":"Just WOW! Just like everything else I had to eat while on my trip to Montreal, everything I had for breakfast/brunch here was amazing! The food here is amazingly fresh and flavorful. The staff is very attentive despite it   always being busy. The patrons are also very friendly. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"My overall experience here egg-ceeded egg-spectations!!! Food arrived quickly despite a busy Sunday morning, the staff was extremely friendly, and the smoked salmon benny was delicious. The eggs were perfectly poached and came with a generous portion of fresh fruit. 

I was really impressed with the selection on their menu - tons of options for waffle, crepe, pancake and omelette lovers. I will definitely be coming back here to try something else!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast here.  It was a Monday morning, and perhaps being able to sit outside and taking in the nice Toronto weather while sipping on my cappuccino had something to do with it, but the experience was good.  I really like the options they had on their menu, esp the fresh squeezed juices.  My friend and I ordered the lobster benny, banana crepes, cappuccino and OJ; everything tasted great.  The only thing that I didn't like was after getting our menu, we waited for a good amount of time but no one came by to at least take our drink orders.  We had to flag another server down and was told that our server would be by shortly... which he did eventually.  However, he was supper attentive once our order was placed, so that made up for the initial wait."}
{"text":"Service was good. I had their French toast which was good but nothing special. 
A modern and trendy Brunch place to go to make oneself feel happy! 
I went there on weekday late morning and was quite surprised that it was quite empty. This place is also good for groups or people with kids. Their menu offers a wide range of varieties so you would be ended up finding it hard to make decision."}
{"text":"Food is OK but service struggles due to heavy understuffing. Coffee and eqqs may arrive cold."}
{"text":"Had to try this place as it is always well reviewed...

Came in at around 3pm..so was given the hote menu...or happy hour menu i guess...

Ordered the montreal burger....juicy cheese burger with ( you guessed it) smoked meat on top....what an enjoyable experience...lol.  the order came with coffee and soup of the day, and fresh green salad or fries if you like...

Next, had the smoked meat poutine...another job well done. Fries were just fried and came.hot and crispy...cheese curds were amazing and the gravy as deeeelicious....again the best part...smoked.meat was the topping....

Theres so much to try in this place like their bennys and bagels...u have to keep on coming back...lol..

Next time.im.in town, im coming here for brunch!

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Eggcellent!  If you're staying in the adjacent Hyatt, skip the hotel restaurant and come here.  Top-notch casual."}
{"text":"Food was very bland. I found egg shell in my eggs but they didn't even bother to apologize for that. The eggs Benedict was also very blend. Poor quality! Not a good service either."}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas Eve and it wasn't crowded at all. Prices are reasonable for brunch. And food was good portion."}
{"text":"The menu at this place is the definition of a good breakfast menu. Freshly squeezed juices, smoothies, coffee, pancakes, French toast, eggs, etc. he freshly squeezed OJ was a perfect morning treat! It really hit the spot. The eggs Benedict over avocado was pretty good too although I think I would have preferred the normal sauce rather than the red sauce they used (you can have the switch it if desired). The pancakes were the only downside. A little dry. My husband had their French toast. And boy, it was out of this world. Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch.. I usually try to eat really healthy during the week so I can pig out during the weekend so I ordered the salad with chicken with dressing on the side. To my surprise the chicken was cooked amazingly week; Flavourful and really juicy. So the salad was really good for an all day breakfast place. 

However, for a rush time like lunch hour on a weekday the dishes took about 40 mins to come and we were only a group of 3. I guess the servers knew we were a little annoyed as we were crunched for time they offered to discount the bill as they took forever. 

The service was nice and the decor was very nice and clean as it was newly opened but don't think this would be my top choice of restaurants for lunch."}
{"text":"This place has great food and great vibes!

First of all, I'm vegan, which you might think going to breakfast places is an impossible tasks, but its not. I always get fruits and potatoes.

Now let me tell you about these potatoes. They are awesome and they give you so many!

My friends and partner had \"real\" breakfasts with eggs and so on and it looks amazing. From what they all told me, its amazing.


This resto gets 4 stars because its a little pricey."}
{"text":"Great concept for a restaurant ! As soon as we saw the name, we were already intrigued !  My wife loves eggs Benedict and guess what, they serve different variety's !  A must try for breakfast if u are ever in Toronto ! Two thumbs up and a five star rating !"}
{"text":"Yes, I know it's a chain, but I still can't resist giving this place 5 stars.
I know Dundas Square might not be the most ideal breakfast spot, but if you're ever in the area in the AM, I wouldn't recommend anywhere else. There is usually a bit of a line, but I've never waited more than 10 minutes at the most. The \"yolk around the clock\" is my favourite dish, and their eggs Benedict is also superb. This place gets super busy, but I have to say that I've never had a problem with the service, and actually have found it quick and efficient. The first time I ate here was in Montreal a few years ago, and enjoyed it there too.
Great Smoothies as well :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this Eggspectations many times, and it's consistently good. Sometimes the service is a bit spotty, but the food has always been great and the portions, healthy.

Today the kiddies and I came for lunch. They each ordered a BLT and small side salad, and one kid ordered a poached egg as well. The sandwiches were fantastic (although they were made without mayonnaise, and the waiter didn't bring the mayo out with the meals, we had to ask for it separately), and the salads were good and light (although you couldn't really taste any salad dressing on them). Our waiter forgot the poached egg as well, but after a mid-meal reminder to him, he brought it out. It was perfect. I ordered their classic eggs Benedict, and it was probably the best eggs Benedict I've ever had, ever. My kids tried it and also raved about it: perfectly cooked poached eggs, perfect Hollandaise sauce (light, and the perfect amount), exactly how this dish is supposed to be. The accompanying potatoes were also cooked to perfection. 

I only wish this restaurant served Coke products instead of Pepsi (but that's my personal bias).

As a side note, the bathrooms down the hall from this restaurant are amazing (I take note of these things!). I'm not sure if they're new or have been renovated in the last year or so (it's been quite a few years since I've been in town and have been to this restaurant), but the bathrooms are new since I've been here last. They have a lot of stalls, all are immaculate, and they are very contemporary, with a dispenser for cleaners beside each toilet, and an automated disposal for feminine products also beside each toilet. (Sorry if this is TMI, but my kids and I've never seen these types of fixtures in public restrooms before, and we were enthrall end and amazed! LOL)."}
{"text":"I adore Eggspectations restaurants, and I think I've been to most of their locations in the city. Their menu is quite large and diverse, specializing in egg dishes (natch), but with a great sandwich, crepe and salad section as well. Our server was friendly (despite our being a larger party, with multiple dietary requests). I was a little surprised when my mom asked if she could order just one crepe instead of two (2 are served when ordering from the regular adult menu, but one one is served if ordering from the kids menu). Despite us having two kids in our party (both of whom ordered from the adult menu), the server wouldn't let my mom order one crepe from the kids menu. (Note: the crepes are really big! No way could my mom eat it all!). 

Also, I was very surprised that they don't serve any quiche here! It's not on their menu at all, and this restaurant specializes in egg dishes. Soooo weird!

That said, the food here is consistently good, the portions are healthy, and I like the ambiance. We sat upstairs, and all the windows were wide open and there was a nice breeze. I was lovely."}
{"text":"This was the first breakfast place we went to. It is cute and trendy! the wait was short, they have English menus. We went there on a Monday so it wasn't busy, the coffee was great and the staff was super nice. If i could eat here everyday I would. i got the steak and eggs and loved it, the French toast was a bit undercooked though. Other than that i would def recommend this place to anyone whose coming to montreal and staying on Saint Catherine"}
{"text":"My family and I came in for breakfast before leaving the city.  I ordered the Montreal eggs benedict with just hot water and lemon.  The french fries were perfect and the eggs benedict definitely hit the spot.  Service was good and the menu is extensive."}
{"text":"Got the Southwest Sunrise and it was great. The salsa was very tasty. The poutine was also fantastic. We had a really long wait (about 45 minutes) on a Saturday at 1130 but luckily the mall is right next door so it was easy to pass the time. Great atmosphere and decorations, a little crowded. Came with one other friend and we were placed at a communal table elbow to elbow with a few other people which was not ideal. But overall good experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing S'mores French toast and fresh fruit. The sunrise omelette was also fabulous. Worth the 1.5km walk from our hotel!"}
{"text":"For breakfast yesterday morning, I went downtown to Eggspectation at Trinity Square. It's a little fancier (maybe a little more trendy?) than the diners where I often go for breakfast, but was nice for something different. There is some patio seating that I guess is closed for the season, a little bar near the front, and is quite large inside with probably 25 tables and a dozen booths. The white wooden chairs reminded me of old country kitchen furniture; there is a set of wooden shelves along one wall, and lots of lighting in the high ceiling. The service was pretty fast and friendly enough.

The menu is similar to other breakfast places, except that many dishes are a little fancier than usual. For instance, I had the French Toast Flambé, which is brioche French toast with lots of strawberries bananas and walnuts that are sautéed in orange brandy liqueur and maple syrup. It was very good. Other interesting dishes were the lobster benedict, a breakfast poutine, and a southwestern omelette topped with salsa and sour cream. They also serve an assortment of sandwiches salads and crepes, plus a daily special for lunch.

My bill came to $20 with coffee, so not bad for the unique experience. Although not somewhere that I would go on a regular basis, I am sure to be back occasionally for something a little above the norm."}
{"text":"This place accommodated the entire party. Their banana walnut Nutella waffles, freshly squeezed OJ, potatoes were all delicious. The service was also great. I didn't give this place 5 stars because it wasn't anything special and more of just a run of the mill type breakfast place."}
{"text":"This place was most definitely one of the best breakfast/brunch places I've been to. The menu is HUGE, but everything looks delicious! We were seated immediately, and our food came out eggsceptionally fast. We ordered the Lobster Omelette and Blackstone Eggs Benedict which were both phenomenal. I'd come here over and over again if I wasn't visiting Canada for only 2 days!"}
{"text":"Services was fast and great. Nice atmosphere even it was a bit crowded. Food flavors and presentation were nice."}
{"text":"I ordered the orange brandy crepe with breakfast potatoes and it was out of this world!  I also had a taste of everyone's else dish at my table and it was spectacular."}
{"text":"Nice place with the usual breakfast fare you would find in an American diner. Prices not bad for the area. Most of the food was very good. Only complaint was an order of eggs over hard. Usually, the yolks are broken but they just flipped them and left them on the grill until the yolk was hard. This made the rest of the egg fairly inedible because it was way over cooked."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a solid choice that will have something on the menu for everywhere then this is your stop. Food wasn't mind blowing or even anything spectacular but it hit the spot.

I ordered the eggspectation omelette which was your standard skillet style omelette with hashbrowns.

My server was great, I asked questions about old Montreal and he happily obliged. 

The restaurant and location itself is very nice, exposed brick, nice art, and decoration. 

I give it a 3 but that, to me, isn't a 'bad' 3, while it was good, it wasn't anything eggceptionally out of the ordinary (see what I did there!?)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a corporate building, which is a little odd, but the food (and service) is great. They use the best of the best eggs (omega-3, baby), so I got to feel healthy for a day. I got the veggie omelet, which came with a side of their delicious potatoes. The portions aren't huge (I'm American so my expectations are probably warped). I also got one of their smoothies, which contributed to my feeling healthy for a day. If I lived here, I'd come for breakfast at least once a week."}
{"text":"Great spot for tourists with big families due to its close proximity to downtown Toronto and the Eaton Center. But otherwise if you're a food snob (and I mean this with love) and/or long-time Toronto resident, stay faaaaar away from this place. The menu is extensive, but super basic and overpriced. There are so many better brunch places in a food city like Toronto, so save that $15-30 for elsewhere. Even Cora's has better food and value than here imo. Vegans beware, not many options here for you besides fruit. I ordered the Greek yogurt (0%) parfait with fresh fruit, granola, and honey on the side - decent sized portion and the ingredients were fresh, but for $11, maybe not so appealing. My friend enjoyed her pear, bacon, and caramel sauce waffles, but wasn't blown away or anything. 

The lines are quite long, especially on the weekends, but you can put your name on the waitlist and they will text you when a table is ready. We only had to wait for ~15 minutes despite a very packed venue."}
{"text":"1st time here! Came for Sunday dinner, ironically, but was pleasantly pleased with the food. I ordered the veggie omelette and partner had the veggie flatbread (i.e. pizza). The omelette was huge, probably a couple of eggs, but super bland... Good for those watching sodium levels, I guess, if you skip the mountain of Lyonnaise potatoes (pan-fried potatoes) :P The flatbread was not spectacular, but was alright. I wish more fresh fruit came with the meal rather than so much potato. In short, the food at this new location is still as basic (and $$) as ever, but sometimes don't we all enjoy being basic ;) The venue is huuuuuge and very beautiful and well-lit, lots of cool lighting and big windows. Eggspectation = upscale Denny's."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Waitress is checking everything carefully. Food is good and fresh. I also ordered the green juice and I d' like to try other smoothies next time."}
{"text":"Loved it! Can't get enough of the wall art I swear. It's awesome. The wait was pretty long but you can track it through Yelp and they send you Text messages!!!! Yayyyyy, so easy to keep track. Also the French toast flambé is a must if you love French toast and fruit. Something you won't regret. & my server Mikala is such a sweetieee!!!! She was fun and exciting I loved it!!!! Good art, good music, great service and great food!!!!! \"It's a Yes from me dawg.\" - Randy Jackson voice"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love brunch?!?  Well no worries, even if you don't love brunch they still have a few options for you on the menu. However, this place, hence the name, specializes and does it just right - 7 days a week, not like these weekend only establishments. 

I went with the pancake, egg, bacon, potato option. Every plate appears to be garnished with edible grapefruit slices or other fruit. There menu also includes very reasonably priced fresh squeezed mimosas with 3 different flavor options. The service was on point. They have indoor and outdoor seating options.

By the way, major points for being able to be added to the waitlist directly from the Yelp app. One day, someone will read this review and say, \"well isn't that normal\", but at the time of writing (June 2017) I can assure you that it's not."}
{"text":"Best Brunch you will ever have and good customer service in Montreal, must visit place"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place for a Sunday breakfast. I got the lobster omelette which left a little something to be desired but was still tasty. My husband got the western omelette which he loved! Fast service and affordable. I would visit again."}
{"text":"Went here with idea of nice brunch. Nice enough seating and funky decor. Negative point right away for room temp milk in little sealed plastic containers that must have been hanging out for a while as there was coffee stains on them.
My sister got an omelet which she really liked.
I got a veg crepe which turned out to be two enormous crepes. The potatoes on the side were lovely & crispy on the outside, with the right amount of rosemary seasoning. The crepe was very doughy and made with too much oil, not at all what you would hope for in a crepe.
The manager inquired why I didn't eat much & I explained what I had hoped to have- he told us they didn't have the right pan & the guys don't know how to make them properly.
We got the bill where we were charged for both dishes."}
{"text":"What can I write? Oh yeah, this place blows the Ottawa, ON location out of the water. Little to no wait at the door, great service, and good food. Table service is fast and the place is affordable. The coffee is amaizing."}
{"text":"I detest puns. You have no idea how much I do. I wanted to hate this place when I heard the name and saw the menu. However, our hotel staff recommended it (also, it was one of the few places open on New Year's Day).

I was wrong. 

The food was outstanding and we were seated promptly. The wait staff were quick with our food and even gave us some tips on how to get to where we wanted to sightsee in Montreal!

I forget what it was called, but I had french toast topped with flambeed bananas, brown sugar, brandy, cinnamon and powder sugar. The potatoes on the side were incredible and the freshly squeezed orange juice was good. Possibly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had!

If/when I return to Montreal I would definitely hit this place up again."}
{"text":"Our last meal in Montreal was at Eggspectation and it was really nice.  Everything was cooked well and although our server was new, she was really good and kept my coffee as full as I wanted.  The only problem was that one of the potatoes on my plate had a big black spot and really shouldn't have been on anybody's plate, but it was easy enough to push it to the side.  The space feels sort of new and modern, but we've been eating in restaurants that looked like the old city and so it was a nice change.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Omg so gooooood. I love this place! I came here Tuesday around 10 am to have breakfast with my friend. The restuarant was dencently full and we were greeted and got a seat promply. We got the the south west omlet and the french toast combo (I believe it is called eggstravant?). The was debating between the pancake and french toast and the server recommended the french toast and boy didnit not dissapoint. The french toast combo was $14.95 I believe and it came with 2 eggs anyway you want, either sausage/bacon/ham, two, two pieces of fruit, sauteed potatoes, and 2 delicious brioche french toast with real maple syrup. The french toast was crispy on the outside with cinamon ans the inside was soft. It waa truly an amazing experience in my mouth. The sautee potatoes were also very flavourful. Everything is was standard. My friend's southwest omlet which was salsa and avocado was also delicious. The portions are huge here! Service was friendly and food came out fast, hot, and fresh. I would definitely come back again to try their smores french toast. Omg just thinking about the french toast is making my mouth water."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment! We went there on an early Saturday morning.

The good: Place is huge! Have good outside seating area. Decor is great. Got our plates barely 10 minutes after ordering.

The bad: Oh boy, where do I start? Benches are uncomfortable. Chairs weight a ton when trying to pull them out. Waiter was very arrogant. No fill-up on coffee (another waitress from another section had to go out of their way to come over and fill it up). When paying debit, machine does NOT give you a choice than a minimum of an 18% tip. Cannot put the standard 15% (which shows where the place's real intentions are, getting your money).

The food: On four orders, only mine was passable. Two out of four plates were cold. The other two were warm (not hot). Mirror eggs were cooked through, so yolk was NOT runny. Toasts were shoved into the basket holding them. Omelette was cold. Bacon way overcooked (even for overcooked bacon). Maple syrup not even real maple syrup (probably corn syrup). Smoothies not that good. In resume, looks great in a picture, but the food is bad and disappointing, and cold (which is REALLY odd for a plate that came out so quickly, which questions if this is not simple reheating).

The bathrooms: Very small and almost impossible to walk around in if you are more than one person. If you measure more than six feet, you will hit your head! Place is dirty. Mould on toilet brush (clearly exposed). Graffitis on wall. Office trashcans in bathroom. 

This is very sad as I had great expectations for this place but was truly disappointed. And add to that an arrogant waiter that did not care about us and that we were obligated to give an 18% tip anyway? Even worse. 

Why can't we find a decent breakfast place in downtown Montreal?"}
{"text":"I love this place! The breakfast items are totally delicious. Have visited a couple of time and each time both my boyfriend and I were really satisfied with the dishes and service. The portion size is really great as well. 
Overall, a great option for breakfast or brunch! Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"the food: this was the first time I've been here and I'm happy to say it really exceeded my expectations! I went for the lobster benny and the flavour was just AMAZING. rich sauce, tons of potatoes. the lobster menu items are pricier than the others but imo completely worth it. my friends got the smoked salmon benny and california dreaming - both are recommended as well.

the service: we heard the lineups get pretty insane on weekends for brunch so we arrived at 10:30am to put our name down. already there was a hefty queue but what bothered me were all the empty tables. they were clearly not reserved and we ended up being put at a patio table that had been empty for the entire 30 minutes we were waiting. our waitress kept forgetting things like utensils, cream/sugar for coffee, water,  napkins, etc. and had to make so many trips. at the same time, she gave SO much attitude saying \"look I have a lot of tables OK?\" totally unprofessional and rude but I guess she was just having a bad day.

overall: I'm very very happy with the food but the service was really poor on the day I went. not sure if sassy waitresses are the norm but I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt because the food does make up for it. if you're not a patient person, you'll want to arrive closer to opening time or on week days!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard breakfast, brunch, lunch spot and it fits the bill for supplying practically any type of breakfast or lunch dish that you're craving

They have a super solid list of various eggs benedict and of course other egg dishes. I would certainly expect it with a name like theirs.

There are two levels to this restaurant and it seems there is ample seating for the amount of traffic they get. Service can be a bit questionable as our server was often just hanging around checking her phone. Although when she was paying attention it was good service.

Food comes quick and the portions are of a nice size to fully satisfy your hunger."}
{"text":"The wait can be a bit long but they do bring a toast basket with a wide variety of jams, PB, whipped butter etc.  The place is also usually really busy and cramped (despite being a large place) so don't expect to reminisce quietly over last night with your breakfast companion.  

The pros are that the food is good, there are a lot of options, they have never messed up an order and contrary to a few reviews below, I have never found hair in my eggs.  

Perfect for bringing family and friends to that are visiting and want to eat breakfast/brunch somewhere central downtown that doesn't have hobos drinking beer in at 11:00 am!"}
{"text":"Great tasting, fresh brunch on Sunday morning.
An easy walk from the Sheraton across from Nathan Philips Sq.
Service was great.

We'll be back next time we're in town for the weekend to see the Leafs/Jays."}
{"text":"I have to say, when we got here on a Sunday late morning this place was absolutely packed. While we waited for a table I thought, \"Ooh, that must mean we're in for some great food!\" Not so. My eggs benedict was good, but just...good. Not spectacular, not great, and certainly not worth the wait we endured. Didn't meet my eggspectations. :-P"}
{"text":"I came here with my 2 buddies for breakfast. We were lucky there wasn't a long wait for a table on a Saturday. We sat upstairs. The service was very good. We got water with our coffee. I don't remember what we ordered but I know we each ordered our entree and shared a savory crepe. I know I got a pic and posted in the restaurant. 

There was wifi available which is great for tourists. 

I would definitely come back for brunch.
Ice was in the urinals. I usually see that in bars in the US."}
{"text":"The best in Montreal. 
We are very discerning eaters from the Bronx and Brooklyn. 
So,we know good eats and this place is the best ever.  
We give these guys five stars!!!

Joey Bag O'Donuts:))))"}
{"text":"Great quick service. Lots of food and drinks before our 14km walking tour. Patio nice way to start day."}
{"text":"Possibly the best breakfast I've ever had in a restaurant.  Great service, nice relaxed vibe, and awesome food.

I had the Eggs Benedict California, and it was not only delicious, but huge, which was great because I was hungry.

Also, a pet peeve of mine at breakfast places is the tiny glasses of orange juice.  Not here!  I think they served me 16 oz. of it.  Maybe it's a Canada thing - everything's served in pints!  I don't know.

I will only eat breakfast here when in Montreal from now on."}
{"text":"Had the classic eggs bennedict with their standard side of potatoes. The eggs were unfortunately overcooked (yolks were almost completely solid) which really took away from the whole dish. The sauce was tasty and potatoes were pretty good. Would go back with fingers crossed that the eggs won't be overcooked."}
{"text":"Sunday morning, 12:30pm, my boyfriend & I were craving a hearty brunch. We stumbled upon Eggspectations after doing a search in my \"Around Me\" app.

Atmosphere: live, spacious, cool and awakening. 
Cleanliness: very clean! Tables, chairs, dish ware and cutlery all clean.
Constructive criticism: wish there was an Eggspectations closer to home (North of the GTA).
Cuisine: American breakfast with a gourmet touch. 
Facilities: sorry, didn't get to see!
Food: We were both equally impressed. We started off with 2 smoothies. 
He had: The TroPical Teaser - A mango, banana and pineapple blend with fresh orange juice.
 I had: The Banana Java - Espresso, chocolate milk, honey and banana smoothie. The tropical teaser has way more flavour. I will try this one next time. For appetizers, we shared the: S'mores french toast - a brioche, stuffed with nutella and marshmallows, with pure Canadian maple syrup and a drizzle of chocolate sauce garnished with bananas and strawberries! THIS WAS TO DIE FOR! The texture of the combination of warm Nutella, chewy French toast and marshmallows was fluffy and creamy! For our entrees he had: The Southwest Sunrise - An omelette filled with cheddar, Swiss and Gruyère cheeses, sautéed peppers, then topped with strips of freshly sliced avocado, special salsa and sour cream. Served with lyonnaise-style potatoes. The salsa was superb! Who knew this combination would be a hit? I had: The Eggs Florentine - Two poached eggs, sautéed spinach and Gruyère cheese on a toasted English muffin, topped with hollandaise sauce and lyonnaise-style potatoes. The hollandaise sauce together with the spinach and poached egg was perfection! 
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: Definitely! 
Parking: parking for this place is across Bay Street underground. It was Sunday so we paid max $6.00.
Portion Sizes: perfect. Not too much, not to little. 
Price: other than the smoothies being overpriced ($5.90e), the food is fairly priced given the quality! Our total bill was $56.10.
Service: we waited by the juice bar for 10 min until a table became available. The place was packed, so 10min wait was acceptable. 
Selection: wide variety! Overwhelming!
Tip: Reservations are available after 1:30pm on Sunday's"}
{"text":"I don't know why I've never visited this place more often. I love the ambience and the food is spectacular! Pricingwise- I would say it's the same as paying for a Dennys meal without over filling. I found it affordable with the quality of food served. I also love the way they do their eggs Benedict. I'm pretty sure that category in the menu will be my go to the next time I visit =)"}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of cheap restaurant options in the Old Port, more specifically and in the legal district. Eggspectation is one such option and I happen to love breakfast for lunch or dinner. 

Yet, Eggspectation is far from being the best breakfast restaurant. Service is okay. However, sometimes the waitresses make mistakes on your order (\"No I asked for white bread, not whole wheat\"). This afternoon, at another location, my friend ordered eggs benedict and instead of English muffins she got whole wheat toasts (?!).

I usually get the same thing when I go to such restaurants: two eggs, potatoes and bacon. Pretty standard and not very difficult. The potatoes are okay, but the eggs are often tepid. The worst is probably the bacon. It's very thin, microwavable bacon. Yuck. 

I once had a burger there. It was not fantastic, but tolerable. The patty was quite dry. McDonald's, which is across the street, makes better burgers. 

The price: $10 (because tea isn't included with breakfast). 

Skip it, unless there is no other option."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise !
I enjoyed a yummy hot late day breakfast after frazzled nerves in the busy eaton centre. 
Waitress was ok. Just a bit distracted and may have been working two areas so getting coffee refill was slow process
Had eggs and pancakes w sausage 
Well presented! Kudos to kitchen. 
Pricey? Well tourists and downtown Toronto so to be expected. 
Going back fer sure!!"}
{"text":"Eggspectation was my first stop for brunch when I was visiting Montreal and I was definitely not disappointed. It has a very casual atmosphere and the restaurant has a very open architecture which makes it a cool place to eat. The food is fantastic. I ordered the eggs benedict which was quite well done and paired perfectly ith fresh fruit and potatoes. The prices are also quite reasonable, and the portions are large. Definitely a spot to visit!"}
{"text":"We need breakfast near by the hotel before our long drive back to Chicago. 

I ordered iced cappuccino but I don't like it too sweet, so I asked for some regular/plain syrup on side. They have no syrup!! The server was nice and she offered for some maple syrup or honey or sugar. Well, if you want to sell some iced coffee, I will suggest to at least prepare some plain syrup for the customers. Cuz sugar or maple syrup or honey won't melt in iced coffee...

I ordered smoked salmon benny. Everything was ok except for my eggs were too cooked, not runny. I also found a short hair in it as well. Fruit on side was bad, seems like it was frozen or refrigerated for too long, not fresh. But I don't want to make a big deal again (since it's already big about the iced cappuccino). 

Entrance is confusing. Our map shows that we have to get into the building, but it is not actually the main entrance. But we were greeted nicely by the hostess tho."}
{"text":"A Montreal classic we were so happy to find in Toronto. Eat anything that's on the menu, you're guaranteed to like it. If not, complain to me"}
{"text":"When here for breakfast on my trip to Canada it was absolutely amazing .. The mimosa I could have drank a entire pitcher it was perfect! The food was delicious and very presentable with fresh fruit would go back again enjoyed it very much!"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe we didn't have to wait for 3 people at 10:30 am on a Sunday. They serve food super quickly here and tables turn over fast. 

Our server was very busy with lots of tables but always made sure we had everything we needed. My friends were very happy with their waffle and eggs benedict. The waffle came topped with tons and tons of berries.

I ordered Egg Cellent - strawberry toast with brandy, flambe style. I thought this meant it would be served aflame, especially with the word \"exciting\" in the name. Apparently it meant they lit it on fire in the kitchen in the pan to give it more flavor. It was my own fault for not asking. The french toast wasn't anything special. The bread was just plain - not very thick and not very flavorful. I'd get eggs next time!"}
{"text":"Drinks at this location are fantastic!  The Bleu Nuit is a very refreshing blueberry, lemonade and vodka drink.  The Sangrias are also fantastic.

For breakfast try one of the many Eggs Benedict.  I don't think you can go wrong.  For a late lunch appetizer, the Brie and Walnut Crostini is a perfect choice!

Great service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"As if it wasn't obvious already, my favorite breakfast food is hash browns. Next on the list would be eggs, usually mixed together with my favorite shredded potatoes. If I can't have them together, I'll usually choose eggs on their own for how versatile they are. This is where Eggspectations comes in, a downtown Montreal brunch chain that specializes in all things eggs.

In spite of it's cheesy name, my expectations were high for Eggspectations. Packed with locals and tourists alike, the place is considered large for the establishments around here, yet there is almost always a wait. Best find what looks worthy on the menu before being seated since service and food can test one's patience on any hungry day.

The food hasn't disappointed so far. While I've had their breakfast eggs straight up (sunnyside up, over easy, scrambled) as noted in their regular platters, I'm much more a fan of their omelettes and eggs benedict, the latter of which has it's own section complete with all the benedict variety one could ask for. Favorites in that section include the florentine benedict (spinach, gruyere, hollandaise), breton benedict (crepes, ham, gruyere, hollandaise), and the boca raton (spinach, guacamole, gruyere, hollandaise). Most of the eggs are poached to perfection and the toppings make for a nice kick in the overall flavor, they just need more potatoes to soak up some of that yolk. 

Feel like going the traditional route? Try their regular platters and enjoy the egg-y names like the egg-chilada, (an ode to a Mexican eggs style i.e. huevos a la Mexicana), egg-stravaganza (french toast platter), oy-vegg (Jewish style breakfast), egg-CITEment (strawberry flambe + eggs), and many more creative naming schemes. What matters is the food is simple and certainly brunch fulfilling, even if there are few items under $10.

In the end, this place is just a glorified Denny's with a special emphasis on eggs. It would've been fitting for it to be a Canadian chain but I learned recently it's also in Virginia and Maryland (huh?). Chains are one thing, breakfast is another, but breakfast chains will almost always get a thumbs up in my book. Eggspectations gets my vote for a solid option in good ol Montreal."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch during our 3-day trip in Montreal. There was a large selection on the menu. Food was pretty good at reasonable price and service was good as well. Would come back."}
{"text":"I try to come here at least once every time I'm in Montreal, which is usually once a year. There aren't too many crepe places where I live, so I try to stuff my crepe-hole when I'm here.

I recently had the Eggspectation Crepe -- two ginormous lovely crepes stuffed with chicken, spinach and mushrooms... Since it was 2pm and I hadn't eaten all day, I inhaled my food, and it was tasty! Service was slow, but since it was busy, I'll give them a pass. Outside, a veritable monsoon came and went, as did a huge protest with police escorts. We had a front row seat.

I went back on my birthday to try to get some more crepes, but since it was a Sunday, there was a huge line. The cafe across the street (Cafe M?) was able to seat us right away, but wasn't that great. I wish we had waited, because now it'll be another year before I stuff my crepe-hole again!"}
{"text":"Came here this past sat and was poisoned by one of their crepes.  Service was awful by the one who served us.  The other waitresses seemed fine.  It was also dead so there wasn't a reason to be served so badly.  The crepe I had was with orange liquor which was saugy and soaking in sauce.  Lattes were warm but not hot.  This was around 4pm in the afternoon.  Very disappointed.  Manager was super nice and helped the girls clean their tables.  Other food was normal.  But very small in quantity for the price.  My meal came with one tiny crepe for 10 bucks.  Nothing else with it, not even fruit garnish.  Hours later I had stomach poisoning which lead me to the bathroom a few times."}
{"text":"Smoked Stress Benedict: was the dish i tried to enjoy at noon today.

The food was perfect. The server was flawless. The hostesses were welcoming. The interior was classy. Even smaller bits of design (on the menu, oversized heavy cuterly) was inviting. 

OMG entire experience was ruined by the 2 owners and one MBA type parolling the floors like grim Darth Vaders or performing other people's jobs, quite poorly.

 DO trust your wait staff. YES: i have ordered my main. I am a single person at a table. I will get out of here fast. Don't undermine your wait staff like that. Don't put your bloody $$ per minute or plate equation on my head.  

DO trust your hostesses. Making a bloody fuss about a single male seated at the 2 person window seat: HORRORS. The arms waving, head shaking, hostess and manager upset, peeking around the wall repeatedly at the poor bastard reviewing the menu was bad enough. Berating the  racialized hostess was unforgiveable. Guess what? 7 minutes later his friend showed up. All is calm.  

Your space is SMALL. Your business model is to hire servers who are YOUNG, ATTRACTIVE and THIN. You will argue up and down how this is not discriminatory. Fine. If YOU do not fit your own (discriminatory) profile & your business model is based on it GET OFF THE FLOOR. (I'm not a thin young attractive thing in neutral or peppy colours either). 

But realize as the 3 of you run back and forth, wave your arms, doing surveillance on tables, looking for errors, you are incredibly distressing to your customers. Couple seated next to me and grandma and child seated on the other side, both talked about these things with me. I\"m not the only one. 

Don't worry Fran's, Jersey Giant. I will be back for your subpar food and comfortable vibes."}
{"text":"I ate here twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch.  I was very pleased with both meals.  The food was quite good and our waiter was amazing and fast and super friendly, especially considering the place was packed.

For breakfast I had a mushroom and cheese omelette, which came with potatoes and toast.  The toast is served in a basket with small containers of jam in really good flavors like strawberry and raspberry, not the crappy mixed fruit or grape cheapness that most restaurants try to get away with.  It also comes with a little container of JIF peanut butter.  That is adorable. Points were scored.  

I also ordered the Sunrise cocktail, which was divine.  It was fresh squeezed orange juice, champagne and peach schnapps, or something, mmm.  My favorite thing was the simplest, a side order of grilled tomatoes.  What an awesome concept.  I wish I could order them in more restaurants. 

A few days later I visited for lunch and had a BLT minus the B and with some C, so you know, a cheese sandwich.  It was also quite tasty, and although you may think it's hard to mess up a cheese sandwich, I've cried over a cheese sandwich before so yeah...good stuff."}
{"text":"Excellent management and service! Food is great and the place is really nice :-) Strongly recommended to everybody..."}
{"text":"The space, inviting
The service, great,
The food,  EGGSELENT

Good portions, properly prepared and served hot."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's not anything amazing but for whatever reason that has been lost to time, it is THE place I go for breakfast whenever I'm in Montreal. Maybe it's the location (most likely) or maybe it's the fact that one time I was there, Canadian folk legend Bruce Cockburn walked right by our table...and proceeded to wait outside for someone for a solid half hour. The whole time I was there while enjoying my rather tasty omelette and above average coffee, I kept trying to think of the perfect line (cribbed from one of his songs) to use in approaching him. By the time I got to one that I liked (it involved the song \"Night Train\"), he had finally left and my food was rather cold. C'est la vie!

Anyways, great location like I said, lots of space, pretty good service and a nice menu. I'm sure there are more exciting and exotic places to grab breaky in Montreal but only at Eggspectation on Maisonneuve can I repeat the Cockburn story for the 100th time. Of course I'm leaving a lot out and it's much better when I tell it in person. But you're going to have to dine with me there to hear the full version!"}
{"text":"Always packed on the weekend, but usually worth the wait.  Great pancakes for those like me who aren't egg fanatics.  The Construction Pancake comes with great bacon, bland sausage and really good sliced potatoes.  Servers are usually frazzled, but good."}
{"text":"The menu is enormous,  but the waiter was very helpful. I had the bravacado and it was amazing!  The fruit cup was fresh and beautiful."}
{"text":"On a word....  S*L*O*W

Nothing special here and heaven help you if you think you might get a quick breakfast before a meeting.

If this place has waiter service (it claims to) then that isn't obvious. They DO have people flitting about doing whatever."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I ate here from a recommendation from one of our co-workers and what a great one it was. We decided to sleep in during our first full day in Montreal and when we were finally out and about, we made our way over to Eggspectation. There wasn't much of a wait, but it was definitely packed. There are many hotels around here which probably makes it a popular spot to eat. They seated us upstairs by the window where we got lots of light and were able to people watch. Our waiter was super friendly.  

I ordered their Eggstravaganza ($12) which came with two eggs (any style) and two slices of French toast, choice of Sausage, Ham or Bacon, served with grilled Potatoes and chef's Fruit garnish. I also ordered a glass of OJ which was fresh squeezed. Their Sausage was slightly sweet which I loved and it made a great complement to my scrambled eggs. Their French Toast was fluffy and delicious!. And their Fruit was fresh and sweet! Loved my meal. My girlfriends and my tummy were very much happy. We were ready to explore Montreal after that!"}
{"text":"Bien pratique sur la rue Sainte Catherine, le restaurant fait partie d'une chaine. La cuisine et le lieu sont aux normes, c'est bien tenu. Nous y sommes allés le soir, les plats de hamburgers bien garnis et servis rapidement sont en ligne avec leur prix. Ce n'est pas exceptionnel, mais honnête et sûr."}
{"text":"I have such good thing so to say about this place. I found this place years ago when they had a groupon deal and I've been coming back fairly often since then. My 'eggspectations' have always been met here whether it's breakfast or lunch type items I've yet to complain about anything. The prices are absolutely reasonable for what you get. Nothing is done in a cheap or diner-ish way. Most dishes that come with side fruit come with a large variety of good fruit, and their homefries/potatoes are delicious and fresh. Even when it's completely packed service is on point, staff are friendly, and food comes out pretty quickly. They have good lunch and breakfast specials as well. The menu is quite large so you'll definitely find something to eat if you're picky or vegetarian (like myself) I love love love breakfast places and this is definitely in my top three. The specialty coffees are fantastic as well. As always, I will keep coming back here."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed eating at this fine establishment I had the classic eggs Benedict and it was out of this world. My friends were incredibly and under the enthralled by the entire experience and told me that they would never eat at another restaurant again the end."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for 3 days. Thanks to Yelp this place came with amazing reviews, so I checked it out. And went there every morning!  Loved the atmosphere. Loved be service. Loved the food.  I will be back on Montreal and this is where I will be coming for bfast. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Just lovely overall.
- PLENTY of seating space, didn't have any wait time late sunday morning(we sat in the patio)

- Interesting menu options, some things they carry that I have not seen in other breakfast places. 

- Really good customer service

My girlfriend became a fan of Lobster meat after having their lobster Mac and cheese.
A very picky eater said they had the best pancakes she has had in Canada so far.

Great place for breakfast in the heart of downtown."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place one or twice every two months. One year ago, I would have said the quality of food was decent. With increasing customers and popularity I find the food quality dropping. This weekend the quality of the food for the price I paid for was ridiculous. My coffee is not refilled, fruits are ripe and poor service. Not coming here again. My word of advice: provide quality service or not serve at all."}
{"text":"C'est en toute fin de séjour, poussée par une envie de club sandwich que j'ai testé l'Eggspectation. J'avais croisé cette enseigne à plusieurs reprises durant mon séjour et les quelques assiettes entraperçues m'avaient donné faim.

Cet établissement en particulier est agréable principalement grâce à sa terrasse donnant sur la rue Sainte Catherine. En plein festival de jazz, c'est un endroit idéal pour se restaurer en écoutant un concert (et oui, coup de chance, il y en avait un au même moment).

Côté assiette, le sandwich était bon, bien garni et accompagné de pommes allumettes bien croustillantes.
Côté verre, mon cocktail aux bleuets était un peu léger et j'ai plutôt eu l'impression de boire une limonade. Un peu traître quand il fait 30 degrés.

A noter la possibilité de remplacer l'accompagnement par des fruits frais."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant for many years now and it can be counted on to provide a good meal and generally good service.  I usually get the Southwest Omelet for breakfast and their steak and salad in the evenings.  This restaurant is located in the middle of the Quartier Des Spectacles (Festival Central) where the Jazz Festival as well as other Summer Festivals are held.  During the Jazz Fest I generally eat at the bar to avoid waiting in line for a table and have enjoyed talking with the bar staff while enjoying my meal."}
{"text":"I had a good breakfast here, friendly service, convenient location, and hearty food. Try the omelets with Lyonnaise style potatoes on the side. I liked their potatoes, also I could not stop eating the warm toasted buttered toast here. I cannot really say what was unique about this place, but good value for the price for sure. I'd stop here again and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Really great options for food and drinks! Was really packed and quite the wait! Omelette was slightly over done but still good nevertheless! I come here every time I'm in Montreal! Merciiii"}
{"text":"Eggstravaganza!

Eggsuberant!

Uneggspected!

Eggcetera! 

Hah! I love the Eggspectation menu!

I also adore the restaurant itself!

A warm and cozy and modern brunchy spot with all things eggs!  Omelettes, scrambles, benedicts!  They have it all.  And its all good.  We visited two mornings during out four day stay in Toronto and both breakfasts were top notch.  I tried the Eggstravaganza and the Eggsuberant and cannot and will not choose which one I liked best b/c they were both delish.  What could be wrong w/ a plate of eggs, brioche French toast (of fluffy pancakes!) with pure Canadian maple syrup, bacon (or ham or sausage) and Eggspectation's Lyonnaise-style potatoes?  There's nothing wrong with this plate. Yum and yum!

As mentioned - the restaurant is so chill and comfy. There's seating inside and out and plenty of it.  We visited around 10-11am on both a Friday and Saturday and had no wait.  Wait staff was friendly and food came out piping hot and quickly.  I can't image having a bad meal at Eggspectations.  In fact, now that I'm back in NYC I'm missing it very much. I eggspect that Hubs and I will be visiting again next time we're in Toronto."}
{"text":"Yum! We loved this place. Decent cappuccino, and I had the 'eggsuberent' which had the most delicious pancakes and crunchy bacon. If I were staying longer in Montreal I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while visiting Montreal and it was eggsactly :D what my friend and I were looking for. 
The service was great! The waiter gave us a map after breakfast on places to visit and see. The food? Delicious! It is a diner style restaurant with a yummy menu full of savory and sweet dishes. It was difficult to choose just one item, so my friend and I ordered 3 different plates. 

The breakfast pizza was perfect for my hangover. My friend ordered the eggs benedict and then we also shared an order of pancakes. yum, yum and yum!

There is nothing fancy or unexpected from this restaurant. It is simple and perfect for a nice breakfast in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"The eggs were phenomenal. Whats the secret to great scrambled eggs? Wish I knew because I would make them at home.
The brioche bread served with meal was perfect. Everything on my \"Eggstravanga\" was delicious. I had the first smoothie on the list..can't recall name. 

I was soo full. Ended up taking the rest as take away to eat later. But really good, my meal did not have a greasy feel.

The atmosphere feels very diner'ish. I came off season Monday AM at 11am...not every crowded so seating was very easy. 
Plus it was 5min walk from my hotel...can't argue with that."}
{"text":"Burgers are pretty decent especially the Eggspectation Burger.  Side salad left a bit to be desired though."}
{"text":"Good brunch menu with many options. This location feels like a bar. I have been to other locations with outside seating and preferred that. 

They have free wifi if you ask for a password which is great for yelping ;)

As for food - my eggs were great. I liked the pairing of the greens with the eggs, bread and sauce. It was well executed. The potatoes were a bit blend and dry for my taste. I tried to add ketchup to them, but didn't help.

I liked that the served fruit with the dish. I enjoy fruit at all times of the day.

My freshly squeezed orange juice was sweet and tasty. My boyfriend ordered a smoothie. The smoothie tasted healthy. It tasted like it had fresh fruit and yogurt, but needed something extra for flavor.

Overall, I liked the place and will be back. Hoping to try the crepe next time. Will avoid the potatoes."}
{"text":"I stopped in twice for breakfast while vacationing in Montreal, Canada and I must say that the meal was awesome! clean establishment and right next to a starbucks- my all time favorite place for a good cup of coffee. They offer an outside terrace dining that allows you to people watch on a good day while the weather permits while i was there. A must check out for breakfast if you're in the area for business or pleasure."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular. It's my first time in Toronto and my friends and I woke up very hungry this morning. The menu offers a wide variety of items that include eggs as well as lunch items. I ordered the Montreal Benny. Wow, I was blown away. It was an egg Benedict with smoked meat, Swiss, poached egg, and pickle. The meat on the Benny was delicious and the Benny was perfect. I also ordered a mango mimosa which tasted like I was buying into a mango. My friend ordered the Belgian waffles gone bananas. When I bit into the waffle to try it, I knew I was missing something from my life. Usually I avoid sweet items but the waffles were the perfect amount of sweet and flavorful. 

If you're in Toronto and love brunch, check this place out! It's an inviting restaurant with delicious food!"}
{"text":"Good, chill atmosphere! Had the lobster egg white omelet. It was pretty tasty! First meal in Toronto and I was pretty pleased.  Really good bailys and coffee too! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Good smoothies and incredible breakfast. Had sunny side up with pancakes and fruit. Comes with herbed potatoes and it's a 9 out of a possible 10 if you're in the mood for really good eggs/breakfast. Service very adequate. Definitely worth going back for."}
{"text":"This was a lovely breakfast spot close to our hotel with lots of hot fresh coffee and a good breakfast selection. Loved the Belgian waffle with strawberries. A little pricey but in line with other Canadian restaurants. Great wait staff!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! It's one of the best restaurants I've been too. I marked this down for when I visit the area again. Everything on the menu l wanted. I went with the Lobster Benny. I highly recommend this place for breakfast. The staff is really friendly. Our waiter did an awesome job. Thank You Eggspectation for a wonderful morning breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome brunch today ! Food was very delicious and our server Martini was exceptional ! Def stop by if you are in Old Montreal !"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food with a very friendly staff. We went there twice for brunch while visiting Toronto. Our waiter Ben was extremely attentive, polite, and friendly. He customized our orders to our specifications and made additional recommendations. Everything we tried was absolutely delicious, especially the fresh squeezed orange juice and the french toast. The menu is very diverse and traditional at the same time, a great selection of wonderful breakfast dishes."}
{"text":"Went for brunch last weekend with a friend who was visiting; I had the brioche cinnamon roll with fruit, yogurt, and honey. The fresh fruit was great, but the bun was incredibly dry and stale tasting. Their bacon, eggs, and potatoes were average. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Are we all talking about the same place? Waiter was hilarious so ill give it a 2 star. Everything else was irrelevant."}
{"text":"Overpriced and food was ok
Service was good but not worth the wait on weekends."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and management. 
Best place downtown to grab a pint and a bite. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"The place is among my favourite spots where to have a delicious breakfast. Located in front of Metro station Place Des Arts, near by a museum and UQAM and about 30 minutes away by walk from Old Port.

There's no doubt that this place has an excellent/quick service... Either if you're going there alone or with a large group.

Menu has a large selection which people have lots to choose from.. Often, I'd be ordering the lobster omelette which is definitely my thing in the morning. The only downside that I have about their plates, for the price you're paying you barely get a few slices of their delicious potatoes.

Overall: Great service, great food = happy me :)"}
{"text":"I came here on the weekend to meet a couple of girlfriends...
Some great things, it's central location, a wide variety of items to choose from...
The downside, the line up, for food that's ok.

I ordered a southwestern omelette.  It was good, mostly b/c it had avocados on it, but I think I prefer breakfast/brunch with more personality.

On the plus side, I think they have something for everyone, but it's not overly adventurous, so safe for most people."}
{"text":"was so good I had to go back the next day to make sure it wasn't a dream. had a couple of friends with me both times and everyone loved their food. service was good and place was clean. I'll be back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I got a cafe au latte and it tasted very good. I got sick afterward. I can't say it is the coffee but the timing is so suspicious. I got the special french toast and it was loaded with sugar. It was delicious but, as I have said, I got sick."}
{"text":"so many egg choices so little time. They do know their eggs and they know how to poach them. 

Their dishes were ok, nothing spectacular or to write home about. The dish I had, came with crepes and the crepes were rubbery. Not a good thing. Someone else's came on these tiny english muffins, needless to say it wasn't very filling. The french toast was good, but their portions were somewhat on the small size. 

But its not terrible, it's just not that ecstatic. Their decor is cute."}
{"text":"The best omelette ( or close) you had in your life
Plus $7 drinks, top destination for breakfast or brunch"}
{"text":"Was in town for business and wanted to check out a new brunch spot. As I heard great things about this place, I decided to check it out and let me tell you, it met my \"eggspecations\" ;) Big open area right beside town hall, so great if you want to sightsee as a tourist after. I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict with a coffee and baileys which was amazing. Other than the small drip-page from the AC unit on my table, I would definitely come back when I'm in town again to check out their lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my colleagues. I ordered a Lobster Mac & Cheese - apparently a signature dish. Got served a mac & cheese without the lobsters. When I mentioned it to the waiter he did not know what to do - he just said that he had forgot. I asked If I can get the lobster on side. Got some pretty tasteless lobster shreds - by that time my colleagues were half done. The cold lobster with the cold mac & cheese was so bad that I could not finish even 50% of the dish and showed it to the waiter when he came back for the plates. We got charged for the mac & cheese either way - not even a sorry. I am not sure if he was rude or if he just did not know what to do -  I would have given it a 1 star service if he was not so dazed. The management needs to train it's people."}
{"text":"This is by far the best value summerlicious lunch I have ever had. For $18, they give you really good food - and LOTS of it!! I got the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon as my main, and it was HUGE. It was so good that I regretted finishing my app (crunchy fresh Caesar salad). The only downside was that the yummy hollandaise sauce spilled on my strawberries and bananas in the generous pile of fruit on the same plate, but that's just me being picky. Otherwise, the crunchy hash on the bottom and a layer of smoked salmon under perfectly poached eggs topped with capers and bits of red onion definitely hit the spot. The dessert (very flavourful crepe) was also very huge. 
Service was friendly and prompt. We were late for our reservation by about 15 minutes because of unreliable public transit, but they were very accommodating."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for brunch. Not very busy maybe because of the weather was very cold. Had the classic one with chicken. The chicken breast is very tender and cooked just right. The whole grain toast was OK. The potato is very succulent. The portion is very big and the price is reasonable. Also had the hot chocolate with whipped cream, best hot cocoa I've ever had! The only dissapointment is the black beans, they taste like cough syrup..."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. So many delicious and creative breakfast choices. Loved their bravacado and south western egg omelette. Freshly squeezed juices were great too! The decor is pretty trendy and inviting. Loved this place, wish we had more of these breakfast choices in NY and  NJ."}
{"text":"Lower your Eggspectations, people.

My girlfriend and I scrambled over here early in the morning, after finding Eggspectation on Yelp, and getting yolked in by all the positive things that customers had to say about the place, so we hatched a plan to head over.

After running through the labyrinthine mall, full of eggcitement, and heading up a difficult-to-find eggscalator, we came hard-boiled to poach some serious eats.

That's when everything cracked. The food was simply uful. What should have been over easy wound up being a truly deviled eggsperience for us, and fried our chances for a perfect foodie week in Montreal.

Suffice to say, I left this restaurant with my sunny side down. Omelette you come to your own conclusions, but our meal was genuinely eggregious."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast but a bit loud. 
If you don't want to wait, I recommend to go early morning (at least before 10 am). 
There is no doubt about food."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic restaurant to visit. Friendly staff, convenient location and great food. Montreal in itself is absolutely beautiful and this restaurant is the icing on the cake. The food was well prepared and absolutely delicious. Prices are very fair. I have not one bad thing to say about this restaurant."}
{"text":"We looked on Yelp for brunch and discovered this place.  We went on a Saturday morning about 10:00, got seated promptly, and by the time we left about 11:00 there was a wait.  I had the Bravocado Eggs Benedict.  My husband had an omelette. Both were excellent!  Great service,  family friendly, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I know Eggspectation is a chain, but this was the first one that I had ever been to and I have to say that I was really impressed with the breakfast they served up over there. My husband and I got the \"Eggspectation\" (three egg omelette, with mushrooms, onions, green and red peppers, bacon, sausage, and ham and served with grilled potatoes and chef's fruit garnish) and split a couple pancakes.  The omelette was made to perfection and the pancakes were pretty good as well.  I had to laugh at the Classic American breakfast that came with baked beans (who eats beans in the morning for breakfast?  No 'Americans' I know! LOL!). Needless to say, I didn't even think to order that one.
The restaurant, itself, is a bustling breakfast hub with tons of tourists like myself and locals alike.  We saw tables of hungover students, cute little couples, and families the Saturday morning we went. The prices are affordable and the quality is great.  Praying the locations around here in Ellicott City and Silver Spring hold up to the high bar the Toronto location set."}
{"text":"Tourist trap and terrible food. If you go here you need to take a long hard look at yourself and ask...why am I even here?"}
{"text":"Good food. Very busy. Had the southwest omelette which was very good. Toast was perfect. Would have liked bigger cups of coffee however...had to keep asking for refills of their maybe 6 once cup."}
{"text":"Food was great! Friendly service . Reasonable price. So much to choose from I had to try hard not to look at the other choices."}
{"text":"Eggceeded all eggspectations!! The best part of our Montréal visit was the food we ate. This little diner was clean and the people working here are very kind! The breakfast that we ordered (eggstravagnaza, steak and eggs, I can't remember the other...) was so filling. Some of their platters are composed of the best balance of sweet and savory. We came here twice because we loved it so much! Fresh grapefruit juice comes in a big glass, and the coffee is wonderful. Great way to start a long day of being a tourist!"}
{"text":"New location on the Esplanade and the service and the food was amazing! We got Chicken and Waffles and the Extravaganza meals and they were delicious. Highly recommended for brunch!"}
{"text":"Great place for vegetarians and vegans as well as carnivores, which is too rare in Montreal as yet. Creative, tasty dishes, large portions (you could easily split a dish).  Sat on second floor, which is sunny, and that was nice after a few dreary winter days.  A bit noisy--the industrial design is nice but the tall ceilings lead to noise bouncing all over the place."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! One of my best memories during my trip to Montreal was eating here"}
{"text":"Besides witty egg puns, Eggspectations has a wide range of breakfast options; eggs benedict, omlettes, sugar shack and other non-egg based dishes like burgers and pasta. I wouldn't say this is a unique place for brunch but it is reasonably priced and has a nice atmosphere. The dish I ordered when I was last here was the Eggs Florentine, which was quite excellent. 

Menu can be seen here:

{"text":"I had the best coffee here! It was so rich in flavor I wish I can get my coffee here everyday. 

Also had the breakfast burger and with the help of some Cholula sauce, it was perfect! 

Service was amazing too. Our waitress was very friendly and let us make changes to our orders. 

Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Visiting for the weekend and my Uber driver suggested here. Glad he did. Ordered the Montreal Benedict, came out quick and was delicious. Wait staff was friendly and engaging, even suggested more restaurants to try and sights to see."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I had in Toronto. I went back twice! Try the southwest omlett and the California Dreamin. The home fries are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with delicious eggs benedict! You will not be disappointed! The menu is pretty expansive and has everything your heart desires. The California Dreaming dish was fantastic! Pancakes are really good too. Must-go breakfast spot in Toronto!"}
{"text":"A wonderful place to come in for a nice brunch on a Sunday morning! 

The restaurant had such a nice interior with nice lights and the atmosphere was so comforting I enjoyed every minute of my stay! The food was absolutely delicious as well; the omelettes were served with the right portions and the potato wedges on the side made the most filling brunch! I had the mushroom and cheddar omelet and I am a one big sucker for cheese so I feel like they could have had more cheddar in the omelet but that was just my personal taste. Aside from the food though, the service was great as well! We went during its busiest hour but we only had to wait for about 10 minutes and we were seated right away. 

I definitely feel like this is a great place for tourists to come visit when starting an early morning as its literally located at the heart of downtown Toronto. After a big filling brunch, a tourist would definitely feel ready to go on an adventure downtown! :)"}
{"text":"As a tourist this was our favorite brunch place. They have tons of beverages to choose from (smoothies, coffees, mimosas etc.) We each had an omelette and had one piece of French toast each because apparently they are well known for these? Anyway, one piece of French toast was FIVE DOLLARS! We asked why it was so expensive and the server said it was made from special bread shipped from Montreal. It was actually...super generic. So I'd recommend to stay away from their French toast, but otherwise it was an overall good experience."}
{"text":"You get a 3 Star only because we had to beg for service.  Waitress was overwhelmed with tables and it took an hour and 45 minutes for breakfast.  When it did arrive it was fresh and tasty.  Best eggs Benedict I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie - he only reason my friend and I stopped in here was because we saw that they had free Wi-Fi! We were visiting the area on vacation, and we wanted to catch up on our correspondences. Luckily, it was a pretty decent place! I chowed down on a good burger (nothing special), but it was fairly priced. The service was the slight downfall for me. She wasn't the greatest, our waitress, but she was sweet. I will tell you that if you need to go to the bathroom, be ready for a bit of a hike! It's down a flight or two of stairs and in a sketchy hallway, but the bathroom is really nice!

If you're looking cuisine that's a bit more exciting, I suggest going elsewhere. If it's a pretty basic meal that you want and you're open to options, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Montreal.  The food is terrific, I love the omelettes, eggs Benedicts, cappuccino freddo, and the lyonnaise-style potatoes which are a house specialty. The service is pretty consistently friendly even when it's busy and there is outdoor seating with great people watching on Sainte-Catherine.  The only drawback is it can get really crowded when festivals are in town so go early because it gets hairy."}
{"text":"Had such a lovely breakfast here with my girlfriend!

She had been craving pancakes all week and I'll kill for a good Benedict just about anytime - enter Yelp. Eggspectation seems like a good choice so off we go on the subway to get into this downtown location.

She had pancakes (which were fluffy and delicious) and served with real maple syrup. She enjoyed them very much. The fruit on the side wasn't ripe.. made a bit of a face when she bit into it. Downer.

I had the Montreal benny with smoked meat and Dijon mustard. I had no idea Dijon would be such a wonderful addition to a Benedict but it really added a layer of complexity I'd like to continue seeing in future. That little bit of acidity went a long way. I'd highly recommend trying this out. Worth noting that my fruit, too, was unripe. Hardly edible. 

Service was smooth, if a bit on the slow end. Had to call out to grab the check. No major complaints here.

Try the Montreal benny!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!! This is a place that if we had one close by, I would have some serious weight gain issues. Of course I had to have the Lobster Benny. It is seriously one of the most wonderful bites I have ever eaten in my life. The English muffin is nicely toasted, the poached eggs is nicely soft. There are large chunks of lobster with the best hollandaise sauce I have ever eaten. My husband had then Belgium waffles and said they were amazing. Our son had a very large portion of French toast, so he could not finish it. My husband does not like French toast but finished all of it and declared he would order that! Their coffee drinks are wonderful. I will find one in the US a decent distance from me and enjoy this experience again!"}
{"text":"Should be called great Eggspectations. Food was good and the service was great. Our waitress never ignored us or the other many tables she was tending to. Definite will return before I leave Montreal."}
{"text":"This is a really great spot for a quick brunch or lunch while shopping. I stopped by with a friend after a trip to the eaton centre and we were not disappointed. The food is great and the menu has a huge variety. We shared a fruit platter and a veggie omelette which were very good. The service was great and they frequently checked to see if we needed anything. I recommend this spot to anyone in the area who just wants a good meal at a fair price."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Food was good.  A dependable brunch place perfect for a few guys hung over from the previous night! No more needs to be said..."}
{"text":"Great food.   Love the eggs Benedict Montreal. It is worth the walk even at 0 degrees.  I always get the eggs Benedict- Montreal style.  Back again this year."}
{"text":"On my first day in Toronto with my wife, we had an amazing brunch here. The service was top notch, the place is ok, the place was packed but the service was still very fast and welcoming.
The most important: the food was excellent! It was above our eggspectations.

Tip: The waffle is a must!"}
{"text":"While this place is certainly over-priced, it has a soft spot in my heart.  Every once in awhile I'll crave my Yolk Around the Clock and the Tropical Teaser smoothie.  

The bacon and cheese omelette is also a fave.  Portions are pretty good.  The home fries are okay.  I like the fruit that comes with it.  They're usually not bad at substitutions as well.  I once went with a friend who wasn't eating potatoes so asked for more fruit and that wasn't a problem.  

I've never had a problem with service, though if you go on the weekend it's usually pretty busy with tourists."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I was pretty happy with everything. There is always a lineup, but I would say it's worth waiting! This time, we didn't order the fancy tea and coffee and went with the regular coffee which made us much happier with the bill in the end! Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Si vous etes au centre Rockland et avez le gout d'un bon dejeuner, c'est la meilleur place. Menu interessant, prix abordable, service courtois et rapide, acces en ascenseur possible, donc parfait pour les gens en mobilite reduite. La nourriture etait bonne et il y a des assietes originales!"}
{"text":"C'est plus un 3 et demi. J'y suis allee car j'etais au centre ville et ledemain veille. L'avantage c'est que tu n'as pas a faire la file d'attentes de 30 minutes pour manger. Personnement j'adore leur menu, y a beaucoup de choix en passant du sante au repas cochon.  J'ai pris le steak avec oeufs. 

Service: A1 notre serveur etait competent, drole, chaleureux et rapide. 

Nourriture: le steak et oeufs etaient vraiment bon, je m'attendais a moins donc j'ai ete satisfaite. La ou ca perd des points, je dirais la saveur, c'est tres simple, rien pour stimuler vos papilles. Et les accompagnements font dures: les patates molles sans gout et les fruits dignent de delicatessen. 

Prix: abordable, tout inclus environ 21$ pour un repas steak. 

Point negatifs: on est mal assis partout. Sur la banquette, j'avais la circulation coupee dans les jambes. J'ai eu des fourmis lol"}
{"text":"Great variety and food, prompt and friendly service. I had the Benedict Florentine and  can't stop thinking about how amazing it was."}
{"text":"Great spot, fantastic food, awesome customer service. Really there is nothing to complain about this place except maybe its a tad bit on the expensive side (hence 4 stars).

Without question, you will not complain about whatever it is you order. Everything is made so wonderfully with good quality ingredients. 

For those who love seafood, I highly suggest the lobster omelette (which I ordered). This came with a side of potatoes, sides of fruit (watermelon and cantelope) and toast. Although this was one of the pricier omelettes, it was worth it. They give ample chunks of lobster in the omelette so every bite does have a taste. 

My friends ordered other types of omelettes and were very well pleased. 

*** You must order their FRIES *** They are AMAZING. Thin and Crisp !!!!

We also ordered crepes, which were nicely glazed with nutella all around."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant! Had breakfast here and I believe I completed my entire plate except for my yummy chocolate chip pankcakes that I had saved to devour later... nom. nom. nom."}
{"text":"Great food,friendly service, great location, good prices and nice comfortable surroundings . One thing guys you need to do something with the entrance, it has a feel of walking into a run down corner store !! I really feel this could put people off. If I hadn't read the reviews here on Yelp I would have kept walking !! To end on a plus I will be back and I will be telling others !!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for breakfast and it was good.  We ordered fruit and a eggspectation bagel.  Bagel was real good, but the fruit was just ok (since having better else where).  Nice place and I would recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"We saw the Eggspectations sign in a few places during out Montreal trip, so we decided to try this chain. The interior decor was mostly wood, with interesting tchotchkes all over. We ordered the eggs with sausage & bacon, and it came out to $9 per person. The food was greasy, service  so-so, and the bread cold. Overall, nothing noteworthy about Eggspectations."}
{"text":"I loved this place it is very nice and taste. The place is spectacular and clean. Fancy place very well designed and organized. the food was amazing I had the breakfast of 2 eggs, sausages bacon and ham. all were good I really linked them all. They served me some beans which was nice as well. The only thing was the price it is somehow more pricey than other place. I guess you get for what you pay. I will definitely recommend this place and most likely I will come here again as it is very close to the grayhound station bus. The washrooms were clean and well placed no complain about them."}
{"text":"Good service, friendly atmosphere, friendly lay out. Long wait on weekends, but if you go there early you can expect to get a seat since it's a large space.  I've been there three times and everytime I've tried different things. I tried their waffles, pancakes, and egg dishes.  Really everything I've tried so far has been great.  I would go there with friends.  Since it's an open space, there aren't many intimate booths so I wouldn't go there with my family."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite breakfast place downtown.

Price is on par with other breakfast places but with MUCH better quality, and with a massive menu.

The only criticism is that the quality is (sometimes) somewhat lacking in off-peak hours.

Love it, never change."}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but one thing that I need in the morning before I have my coffee is a restaurant whose name is anchored in a really bad pun.  All sarcasm aside, a good breakfast would also be beneficial.  Thank you, Eggspectation.

A franchise anchored in, well, eggs, you'll be shocked to find out that they serve a good breakfast here.  Actually you won't.  Eggspectation provides a menu with a wide range of breakfast options that don't necessarily involve the egg.  Their breakfast meats compliment any breakfast, and above the usual bacon, eggs, omelettes, and Eggs Benedict, you're also able find sandwiches, salads, burgers, and even pastas.  They also have a full bar, specialty coffees, and a small wine list which if you're hitting at breakfast may indicate a problem best discussed with a professional.

Located inside the Eaton Centre (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/toronto-eaton-centre-toronto), Eggspectation provides a fresh alternative to the restaurants and food courts found inside the mall itself, and also provides a breakfast option for those that wish to get an early start on their shopping day.  After all, there's a lot of protein needed for shoe sales."}
{"text":"Food was awful and I felt nauseous after eating there (i.e. very greasy). The potatoes were stale and greasy, the sausages were cheap and greasy, the bread was store bought and the coffee was very watery. Service was friendly. Given how nasty the food is, the meal was overpriced. Never visit again."}
{"text":"Oof, this was unfortunately not a great experience.  The food was ok (3 stars) but the service was horrible (1 star).  There was nothing super special about the eggs benedict, but it was at least edible.  The service was SO SLOW and it felt like we had to ask for everything at least 10 times before we got it.  Every table was nearly livid by the end of the breakfast service, which indicates to me that it's just a broader issue.  It was pretty astounding seeing just how awful the service was, but I guess I felt better knowing I wasn't alone?

In short, food was ok, service was bad.  Wouldn't recommend and definitely don't come here in a rush."}
{"text":"This is an eggcellent place!
My friend and I went to grab brunch here on Canada day, and not sure if it's usually that busy but we had to wait 10-15min for a table on their patio. The restaurant is fairly big for a breakfast / brunch joint. Their food is pretty good with big portions. Slightly above \"eggpectation\" (ha). Their coffee is good, and their refills all tasted the same. One downside is that their service is sort of slow, as in their servers walk by you multiple times and not notice your passive-aggressive hand wave until you call for them or tap them on the shoulder. Another downside was that their bathrooms were disgusting. There is no air ventilation in there, and garbage was piled up so high some were overflowing out of the cans. I would come back for brunch, especially since it's conveniently right outside the Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"I came to Montreal for business and found myself at this place every morning.  The food is so fresh and such a variety of things to order. This place is great and I have to mention that the coffee is also a plus.  Definitely will be back...."}
{"text":"Great & quick breakfast spot. Delightful staff and lots of seating. Very casual and prices are so reasonable.
I love the fresh cut potatoes - so refreshing to see real food on my breakfast plate. Typically, we see hash browns or cubes potatoes, but this is the real deal. Yum!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in service. We went here Saturday and there was a line. The hostess asked if we wanted to eat at the bar. We said yes. Once our food came we were ignored. I had to get up and ask for a second cup of coffee, ask for the bill etc... On Sunday we went and the wait was longer. We asked if we could sit outside and the receptionist at the desk said sure. After waiting 20 minutes, the hostess went to seat us inside . We said we wanted to eat outside. Her anger was visible and she told us to wait. We waited ANOTHER 20 minutes and we went to the receptionist. We had been forgotten. She had the hostess go seat us and she stormed off so fast we couldn't follow her. The other receptionist ended up seating us outside where surprisingly, there were lots of empty tables. The food here is decent, nothing great but the service is poor."}
{"text":"In loooove with the French toast flambe. I've  ordered it everytime I visit this place in Montreal. I've been to alot of brunch spots and hands down it's 5he best french toast I've ever had in life. Service is good. Smoothies are delicious. Lots of menu choices. Pretty outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The food was good here and the staff were very nice and helpful. Service was quick and the ambience was quiet and low key!


Perfect for a quiet brunch over conversation!"}
{"text":"Beyond my eggspectation:). Great dining experience.  The juices are awesome, southwest sunrise omelette with potatoes and pancakes were A+. Our waiter, I wish I remembered his name (he has a beard), was EXCELLENT, courteous, and attentive!  Even though super busy, the hostesses were still very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"This place is kinda dopey in decor and punny menu names, but the meal was solid. It's like the type of place you take your parents when they come visit you from out of town, or when- like me- you're visiting from out of town and just want a real no frills brunchy-brunch. 

I got the french toast flambé and it was not on fire- frown- but was pretty damn tasty... bananas, strawberries, walnuts and grand marnier plus maple syrup on three pieces of brioche french toast. A solid cafe au lait too. 

I don't know, no complaints! It was what I expected, huge portions, and well priced for brunch. Perhaps I'm just too used to being gouged in New York that the second I have a solid brunch anywhere else for under $12 it's like a goddamn beacon of light."}
{"text":"Overcooked eggs benny, overly yogurty smoothy, hair in my food, mediocre service."}
{"text":"I was really let down by this place. I had the \"oy veg\", two over easy eggs over potato \"latkes\" which really turned put to be deep fried hashbrowns. We sat right by the open view kitchen, which might have been a mistake as I witnessed some rather unsanitary kitchen behaviour. One example of this was the pot they were poaching eggs in, which looked like it had never been cleaned and had a mound of discarded food around the base of it. needless to say, I changed my mind to over easy. I also saw the main cook who was plating take a pile of coins from a waitress and continue on to grab slices of ham to add to someones plate with his same hand. overall will not be returning. if you want a good breakfast in the area, try the senator  on Victoria"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat breakfast or brunch in downtown Montreal. Been coming here a fee times during trips here hut this is my first time since 2011. Still same great atmosphere and still the same great location on Ste Catherine across the Museum. 

Within walking distance of many if the hotels in the area and a great spot to visit for a nice hearty meal. The atmosphere is always lively and very and inviting. 

The staff are friendly in both English and French. The choices are  ice combos and very rich and well done. 

I woke up after a long work party, ordered a honey blue smoothie and a southwestern omelete which had avocado, salsa, and their house special sauce. The eggs are omega 3 rich eggs and the presentation is very inviting. Nice flavours and would definitely order again."}
{"text":"I ate at Eggspectation for breakfast and I enjoyed the experience. I ordered the Eggsuberant combo which was eggs, pancakes, bacon, and potatoes. All of it was good but I loved the lyonnaise style potatoes. The pancakes were a little small but the fresh syrup made up for it! 
Would return and recommend to others."}
{"text":"My Great Eggspectations were dashed by going to this huge LETDOWN of a restaurant.  First of all, the dining area upstairs in about 15 degrees warmer than downstairs which makes it blisteringly hot up there.  The chairs in the restaurant are iron or something similarly painful to sit upon.  You cannot get comfortable in these seats!  My husband ordered the french toast Flambe (Eggcitement).. awful. overly sweet and syrupy and flambeed in the kitchen.  I had the waffle with strawberries with unripe strawberries.  If the strawberries are out of season, why are you serving them? We had a couple over easy eggs on the side and our bill was well over $30.  Plus the bathrooms are dirty with a big \"D\". Won't be back and regret not making our way across town to Restaurant l'avenue for breakfast."}
{"text":"I've visited eggspectation quite a few times over the last couple of months. The food quality has been really inconsistent. Tried their western omelette yesterday and it was a huge disappointment - i'd say it's average at best. It's such a shame, because I remember how great everything tasted on my first visit."}
{"text":"We wanted to have Montreal Brunch but most places did not accept reservations. Eggspectation is a huge place so turn around seems quick and for us there was no wait. There is a huge menu selection. We ordered a veggie crepe, salmon benedict, and a avocado benedict. Everything was ok, not bad but nothing amazing. I've definitely had better brunch places in local diners in New Jersey. If we were to return to MOntreal, would definitely try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast joint! We got the Russian rhapsody and the smores French toast- both which were awesome!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous. Wonderful brunch food - waffles with fruit incredible, eggs benedict to die for, perfectly cooked eggs, delicious cafe au lait. You must visit one of their locations when in Montreal."}
{"text":"For those health conscious, l highly recommend eggspectation the green smoothie and other nutritious items are the best."}
{"text":"What we had:
1. smoked salmon eggs benedict (with fruits)
2. eggspectation omelette (with home fries and fruits)

The benedict was excellent: fresh, juicy, and rich in flavor. I strongly recommend this dish.
The omelette probably is their feature omelette (eggs with mushrooms, onions, green
and red peppers, bacon, sausage, ham) tasted great, but the eggs might have been cooked too long, so the texture was a little bit \"old\". Even though this was disappointing, this was the only disappointment. I would strongly encourage breakfast lover to go for this place!"}
{"text":"S'mores French Toast - Nuttella and marshmallows melted between two pieces of french toast served with a side of fresh fruit drizzled with more nuttella and marshmallows.  Absolutely delicious.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Very good brunch place in downtown. easy parking downstairs at Cityhall and nice patio."}
{"text":"I highly recommend their breakfast burger. It's delicious, portion is big, and it's pretty unique in my opinion. Classic egg Benedict was good but too bland for my taste buds. Pancakes were pretty decent too. Came with a lot of fruits which helped with the presentation. Pretty pricey so keep that in mind if you are broke!!!"}
{"text":"Huge dining room, clean, nice restrooms/washrooms and I love the shabby chic/modern look. Our waitress was very nice and even took a couple pictures of our group.
They have nice patio seating with umbrellas for shade if needed, the buildings around are nice to look at and the trees are beautiful too.
They have really good fresh squeezed orange or grapefruit mimosas (and others options). 
The menu was amazing, I seriously wanted to try everything. We made a day trip to Toronto from Niagara Falls, and this was where we decided to eat when we made it to town. It was the best choice! If you're visiting or are local and haven't tried it, it's a must! Everyone in our grouped absolutely loved what we ordered (and we all ordered something different). I had the French toast (I forget the name of the dish but it came with potatoes, eggs and bacon too), but the French toast was honestly the best French Toast (with real Canadian Maple syrup) that I've ever had! Sooo good!"}
{"text":"It was my bachelor party weekend and I lost my team. I was hungry, and I needed a wonderful omelet. This place filled the bill. Seating is a bit crowded, but I enjoyed my inside seat in an open window facing the patio. There is nothing like the sounds and sights of weekend Montreal to start the day. 

My server was friendly and quick, I never had to wait long for water or for a translation from the menu.

My ham and cheese omelet was lovely. Everything tasted so fresh, and the portion sizes were reassuringly American. The potatoes were especially lovely, cut in slices and seasoned and salted perfectly.

Best part, I ran into my friends sitting at another table. They loved it as well."}
{"text":"The food and service was EGGcellent!! I ordered the black stone eggs Benedict for $14.95. It was like a regular eggs Benedict but had tomatoes, bacon and avocado in it. It came with a side of potatoes and fruit (a slice of grapefruit,watermelon and cantaloupe) . Loved everything about this restaurant, must check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm applying the NYC diner standard when measuring Eggspectation. I'm not even using an excellent diner, just your average NYC diner. So for the same food, the price at Eggspectation is almost twice as much, the service isn't as competent or attentive, and the food quality isn't quite as good. For example, the corned beef hash is straight out of a can and is barely warmed up, whereas most diners in NY, the corned beef hash is out of a better can and is fried up w/ a nice crust to give it some textural contrast, and heated all the way through. And Eggspectations potatoes/cottage fries/whatever they are are plain and weirdly cooked.

Secondly, service for us was inconsistent. Our waiter didn't bring us water or ask us if we wanted any, but he did ask the table next to us if he could bring them some. While I ordered coffee, and repeated it as he walked away, I still had to ask him a 3rd time for a cup. After our food was served, we had to wait a few minutes for him to come anywhere near us before we could waive him down and ask for our toast. Getting coffee refills took a while since our waiter didn't swing past that often. Lastly, after we were done eating, he came to us and told us he'd be unavailable for a few minutes while he served the other tables. Well, at least he let us know."}
{"text":"This is my third time returning and I don't plan on stopping. There is tons of space and the lights are warm and homey with lots of seating able to accommodate a diverse number of groups. I arrived around 10am on a Tuesday and my friend and I were seated immediately. The service was fast and friendly, no complaints.

Now for the food and a lil anecdote. As a kid I thought Hollandaise sauce was this high-class, scrumptious, liquid gold that people would always praise. Then I had my first encounter with it and that was through a sauce packet. I know, big mistake, but I was a dumb nine-year-old. I concluded that it was disgusting and vowed never to try it again. But here I am, a proud hypocrite because yes, yes, and yes again, real Hollandaise sauce IS liquid gold. Especially the Hollandaise here. I have dipped my toes in a few other Hollandaise ponds since my vow of sauce abstinence and this place has them beat. This time I ordered the Blackstone eggs benny (poached eggs with grilled tomatoes, avocado, and pork/turkey bacon, on top of toasted English muffins, served with their Lyonnaise-style potatoes) and it was as delicious as can be. My friend's eggs were unfortunately a little overcooked (the yolk wasn't runny at all) which is unfortunate because I was championing this place to them for weeks. Other than that, my only wish is that they would add more gold--I mean sauce because there really isn't enough. 

Goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway: I'll be back again, but maybe to try something other than Eggs Benedict (no promises).

TL;DR go here."}
{"text":"Decent food, but avoid the grapefruit juice like the plague. Mine had seeds in it. Service isn't the greatest either."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was slightly skeptical when I found out that this place was right in the tourist area. Good first, then bad/annoying:

Turns out, at least for what I ordered, the place wasn't overhyped. I had the california dreaming eggs benedict, and I substituted potatoes and toast with fruit and english muffin. The muffin was toasted just right so that the hollandaise sauce didn't overwhelm its structure, and the salmon was salty enough to give the asparagus and spinach a balanced flavor. Poached eggs were good, although the yolk was not as runny as I would have liked. Hollandaise sauce was creamy and thick without too much of a lemony flavor that I sometimes find in other places. Server was efficient and politely curt.

BUT FYI: I was not told that having fruit instead will set you back $2.50 and changing to muffin with set you back $.50. This kind of peeved me - I'm just changing toast to muffin and other places would never charge you extra for substituting one kind of bread with another. Potatoes to fruit - okay, I understand that usually there is an up charge, but the server did not mention it and conveyed the impression that substitutions would not incur extra $."}
{"text":"Fast service and delicous food! I was looking for a good brunch spot on Sunday and found most places to be closed. Then I came across this restaurant on Yelp, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it's conveniently located around the corner from where I was staying. With its cute name and great location, I decided to stop by. 

I was seated immediately...the restaurant was packed. Not long after I sat down, a line started to form by the door (I came around 11AM). My waiter came over promptly and took my order. My food came shortly after. I cant remember the name of what I ordered (check out the pic!) but it was delicious! And enough to fill me up for the rest of the day! Everything seemed to be reasonably priced as well. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad, but wasn't the best. For the price point, I would have appreciated higher quality food and better service. The service was painfully slow. 

On the plus side, they do have fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice!"}
{"text":"It meets the eggspectation. We love the food. The service is great too. I especially like the original egg Benedict. Est here!"}
{"text":"I will not go back to this place. The first time I went, I ordered mac n' cheese because it was 2:00 pm. The macaroni was disgusting. It was a bowl of penne smothered in butter with some stringy, melted cheese on top. There was no cheese sauce, there were no breadcrumbs, etc. Seriously, Kraft dinner tastes better. Really disappointing. I figured it was my fault for not ordering breakfast food, so I tried again today. I ordered blueberry pancakes. Ugh. The pancakes were small, dry, and there were hardly any blueberries in them. I was actually shocked when I got my plate. The pancakes looked like the frozen ones you can buy in the grocery store. Next time, I'll just make breakfast at home and save myself the money and the disappointment."}
{"text":"Day 2 of asking our hotel concierge where to grab brunch, and a step up (see Sunset Grill review). Of course, it was also a step up in prices, but I'm used to Chicago-priced brunches, and this was pretty comparable. 

The menu is fairly expansive, and contains all your breakfast standards involving every permutation of egg dish, mostly all accompanied by their lyonnaise potatoes. My standard scramble was light and fluffy, and my boyfriend's Lobster Benny was tasty. Not sure what, if anything is so special about the potatoes, but I could take or leave them. 

While the food is great, this places loses stars based on service. At 11am on a Monday morning, the places was pretty empty. This, however, did not mean attentive service. After we were seated, it took 10 minutes for a server to approach us. Coffee took another 10. Refills were non-existent despite me trying desperately to flag down our server. There was plenty of staff buzzing all over the place (mostly standing around the hostess area talking to each other), and with only a few patrons in there, there's just no excuse for inattentive service."}
{"text":"We tried Eggspectation while on the hunt for breakfast.  Close to our hotel and not hard to find, it was reasonably busy but we didn't have to wait!  If we were another fifteen minutes we would have though!

Hubby tried the eggs benedict- eggs perfectly done, bacon crispy and tasty.  He was very happy.  I tried the French toast flambé- a word of caution that the walnuts are really hot when they first come out.  Didn't think that through and I was really hungry.  Loved the strawberries and bananas on top.  Our server was friendly and attentive, food was quick, although we had a hard time deciding what we wanted to eat because everything on the menu looked so good.

We'll definitely be back when we visit Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Excellent place! -Conveniently opened early on a weekend, my wife and I went for breakfast on Sun @730am. It was empty. 

Good service, great food! Spacious and comfy restaurant, with about 30 indoor tables; 20 outdoor tables. 

Great menu! A page each of griddle selections, omelet and eggs bennies, as well as, numerous other breakfast and brunch items. The Lyonnaise potatoes are bomb! Entrees are $6-$15. Two coffees and breakfast entrees totaled $36."}
{"text":"My good friend (who is Quebecois) and I had breakfast here the other day.  I really enjoyed the sort of sugar shack special: maple syrup, eggs, maple syrup, smoked ham, maple syrup, potatoes, beans, maple syrup and maple syrup.  He took a traditional breakfast what I would think of as a \"lumberjack special.\"   The plates came with lovely fruit: pineapple and grapefruit and orange, a nice serving and very fresh.

I liked everything so much I went back the next day.  I had banana walnut pancakes, which were much more like cake than pancakes (for me as a US person).  They were scrumptious but so filling that by the time I ate the generous serving of fruit, I could only finish one pancake.

If you're visiting, I'd really go to this location as the other one is very small and the service is less good if you're English speaking.  Also, it's right in the pedestrian zone and across from the art museum.  Fabulous."}
{"text":"1er jour à Montreal, 1er petit déjeuner à Eggspectation et je n'ai pas été déçue.
De supers pancakes au sirop d'érable et un très bon smoothie. Je n'ai pas été déçue. Bon service et surtout excellent emplacement."}
{"text":"Given the solid reviews, we went with some friends to Eggspectation for a brunch outing before heading out to a wedding in the suburbs. Despite having a decent amount of outdoor space and a large indoor eating area, the restaurant was packed around noontime, and we only got a seat because we made a reservation on the fly before showing up. The restaurant itself is pretty casual, with relatively high ceilings and lots of sports on television giving it a very casual feel. Service was pretty quick as well, with our juices and smoothies coming quickly after we ordered them, and everything else shortly thereafter.

Despite the reviews, I have to say that I found everything to be quite average. There's nothing wrong with that, but nothing stuck out. I had the Southwestern omelet, and despite the very generous servings of avocado, the salsa was pretty bland, and the omelet itself was cooked a little too much for my liking. The potatoes were solid and generous in portion (I wasn't able to finish them), so you won't go leaving on an empty stomach by any stretch. If anything, I did enjoy the solid selection of juices and smoothies; I really enjoyed my citrus-heavy smoothie that helped cool off on a hot summer day in downtown Toronto. I did try a little sausage, and similarly - nothing too special or of note.

Eggspectation has a lot of different options for brunch, making it quite difficult to decide what to get that. That said, the food is pretty standard, and it does not really taste much different than any generic brunch spot. It might be worth a return visit whenever I am back, though, simply because there are lots of different things to try."}
{"text":"Food from Montréal never disappoints. One of the better brunch places I've been to with delicious egg Benedict. Service was fast and the food came out very quickly despite it was packed during the early morning."}
{"text":"We'll start with what's annoying: the wait for brunch. But, you can put yourself on the list right from Yelp which is AWESOME. The first time I came here, we were on the list but still ended up waiting for about twenty five minutes. The second time, we put ourselves on the list and didn't expect the wait to actually be five minutes when it took us about 15 to get there. We missed our spot, but only waited about 10 minutes to get another table. So, it's irritating but trust me--the wait is worth it. 

The first time around, we both tried smoothies--green machine and a banana cocoa one, and they were both delicious. I had the smoked salmon benedict that time, and it was glorious. The next time, I was really in the mood for pancakes so I tried the ~Eggsuberant~ which comes with eggs, pancakes, a meat of choice, potatoes and fruit. The pancakes were incredible, I'd say take or leave the potatoes--they're not amazing enough to pass up a healthier side if you want it. 

The restaurant itself is cool with a lot of Montreal themed artwork. TVs play sports highlights, tables are fairly close together so beware if you're maneuvering with a giant bag--you may knock over water on an empty table and then feel extremely sheepish. Just a hypothetical, of course....not that I did that or anything....yeah. 

This has become our go-to brunch spot--when we're not in the mood for Dim Sum, that is!"}
{"text":"Overall not so good. Over easy eggs were raw....not talking a bit runny or loose but the white was clear.  They then explained to me that is how eggs are cooked but they would overcook some for me.  I passed.  they did charge me for it which I planed to pay for anyway since it was my choice not to get another order.  the server was fine."}
{"text":"I came here while visiting Toronto for a few days. The food was amazing. I am not an egg lover but their omelet and eggs benedict were to die for. I came here on a Saturday morning and there was no wait. The service was good and everyone was super friendly there. I would definitely come here if I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Since I was a party of one on this particular trip to Toronto, the staff was able to sit me within 5 minutes.  At 10am on a Saturday morning, that isn't too bad.

Several interesting egg combinations and even lunch items were available.  The beer, wine and turbo-charged brunch drink selection was sizeable, too.  I settled for ala carte items--scrambled eggs, bacon and cottage cheese--since the combos either were too large or didn't interest me.  

Why is it that most plates had baked beans included?  Must be a British holdover.  I will never understand that combination for breakfast.

The sangria was good.  One was enough, however, since it was potent."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Out of all the chains I've been to, this is my favourite. Easily beats Cora's, Fran's, etc.

Eggs were cooked perfectly. The way they do their potatoes/home fries is pretty neat. There is this air of quality in what they cook up here. It's breakfast, nice and simple, hits the spot, but there is this hint of sophistication, class and refinement, while not being over the top, that makes this a really neat spot.

I don't think I'd travel out of my way to get here, but if you're ever in the area, it's an excellent place for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"5 star!!! If youre on a ketogenic diet this place is a definitely a place to eat for keto. I ordered uncle Sam no bun very delicious and southern style omlette no lyannaise potato sub with cold tomato. Highly recommend breakfast joint."}
{"text":"First time to Toronto and first breakfast in downtown. Love itttttt! Lobster omelette, French toast and others are very very tasty. Great atmosphere and definitely worth visiting!"}
{"text":"On both of our trips to Montréal, weather was either crisp or just downright bitter. Butter toast would've been a great starter before hitting Old Montréal... but let's be honest, Seafood rules here and I wasn't gonna pass that up.

Main Level has lots of seating space with counter service also- plus an upstairs. But with all their space though, table arrangement is just downright tight. But looking back, service was friendly. Brick walls, cement flooring, metal chairs, wooden tables and ceiling pipes- make up the style.

My Lobster Benedict (w/ no Hollandaise as I requested), had small Lobster chunks- and was tasty. Mimosas were another hit as Eggspectation didn't cut corners with the bubbly. On our second trip though, wanted to relive that outstanding Lobster Benny- but the Lobster was chopped up in gaziliion pieces and tasteless- and left more than half behind. As a back up, Nutella Walnut Pancakes, turned out to be good. I liked their menu and felt it has something everyone can agree on. And for a Breakfast/ Lunch spot on the go, Eggspectation was good."}
{"text":"I've been going to Toronto for the past 8 years or so and once I knew there was an Eggspectation in the city, I had to go. On my recent visit, the location had changed but the menu nor the flavor of the food did. Will definitely visit again on my next visit. Like having to visit that one family member you have to visit."}
{"text":"Great location just outside the Eaton center yet also quiet and with great view. The orders were served within 15 min at busy hour. Food was nice as well."}
{"text":"Many options,  great atmosphere,  great waitstaff. Food came out fresh and hot.  Would go back again any time."}
{"text":"A traditional breakfast or brunch place.... the Server was fast... everything it's ok... nothing special..."}
{"text":"Upon walking in, it almost looked like a country kitchen. The ambience us amazing. The service was egg-ceptional, lol. The food was amazing to say the least. Everything is delicious, but you have to try the Lobster Benny!"}
{"text":"I needed breakfast, I needed it to be reasonably priced, and I needed to get back to my conference before 8:30a. You would think that early-opening breakfast spots wouldn't be hard to come by in a business area, but my internet explorations had given me limited options. I was excited to find Eggspectation - whose name clearly indicated that my breakfast quest had ended. 

Service was good and quick. My waiter was friendly and helpful and kept my coffee and water brimming. The food was solid - I had the \"Eggstravaganza,\" which basically means \"we will give you all of the breakfast food so you don't have to make any decisions before the coffee starts working.\" The French toast was excellent, bacon was crispy but not burnt, eggs were cooked well, and potatoes had surprisingly good flavor. A step above standard diner fare (although a slight step above standard diner prices). 

I'm sure the locals could point me to breakfast spots that are more beloved, but odds are they're a bit farther out or have longer waits. For an out-of-town visitor on a tight schedule, this was a great find for my early morning."}
{"text":"Egg-cellent place to try while n Montreal! Especially if you arrive in Montreal at 7 AM, and the street are empty and you have luggage with you. We arrived in Montreal super early, hungry, and tired. Upon arriving downtown, we happened to find Eggpectation. Friendly staff, nicely decorated restaurant and outdoor seating is also available. Just let the hostess know that you don't speak french and they will provide an english menu. Large portions! so prepare yourself! The dishes that we got we're good, so you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I had the high rise pancakes and boy was I stuffed! I couldn't even finish it. Nice warm fluffy pancakes with a perfectly cooked sunny side egg."}
{"text":"A crazy world of touristyness.  It is SUPER loud in here and really chaotic.  But, it was by the hotel and, if you get there early enough, it's not too hard to get a table.

I had the eggs benedict and my friend had an omelette.  Her omelette was HUGE and filled to the brim.  My hollandaise sauce was cold, but the eggs were poached well and the potatoes were yummy.

It was hard to track down our waiter, as he seemed to be serving 20 tables at once.  But, when he was around, he was very nice."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for breakfast. Cozy place, the food taste very good, worth the money $$. The staff are very helpful, also if you see the condiment they are using high quality goods. Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Creative menu, good food; fresh squeezed orange juice.  Would come here again if I'm ever in Montreal."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere here were great. I was expecting kind of a divey breakfast place but it's actually fairly upscale. The menu is huge and just about everything on it sounded good to me. I ended up going with the cheeseburger with a sunnyside up egg on top (which they will add to any burger at no extra charge! I've never seen a restaurant offer this option!) 

Prices are reasonable, service was good, coffee was frequently refilled, and I left here very full and very satisfied."}
{"text":"The BEST breakfast place in downtown Montreal

Eggspectation on the corner of De Maisonneuve and de la Montagne is a wonderful breakfast spot. The interior is a renovated heritage building with lots of artifacts dating back to the early 1900's. The staff is friendly and the menu is awesome. The meals present better than they sound and the portions are substantial. There are numerous breakfast and lunch items.

They have a main level dining room as well as an upper level. I have been going to Eggspectation for many years and I believe this is one of the best breakfast spots in Canada!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and I wouldn't say this place has the best breakfast or anything but it's super convenient for me to come here because it's located at such a prime spot. The atmosphere here is also quite nice. I've sat both inside as well as out on the patio. I love the patio because despite being smack right in the middle of downtown, it feels peaceful and isolated. I've gotten the bravocado benny which I thought was quite good. I was surprised they actually gave you a whole avocado and I loved how the poached egg was inside where the seed was, creative. The California dreaming benny was only okay. I liked that instead of a English muffin they used potatoes but overall blended together, I've definitely had better smoked salmon bennies. What I do recommend is the freshly squeezed juices, definitely fresh. 

I would probably come here again due to convenience but I wouldn't say I'm craving my next meal here."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 star rating based on the only thing I've eaten here (twice) the Bravocado. It's phenomenal."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place I've ever been to in my whole entire life. 

I love punny names. I love the whisks as door handles. I love eggspectation crepes. I love everything about this place. 

Back in NY and still dreaming about that crepe."}
{"text":"I usually go here once a while with my son to start our day out together downtown.
It is always buzzing in the morning. I always get the \"eggspectaion omlette, which has onions, sausage, bacon, bell peppers. Very delicious with homefries and side fruit.
They also have a couple options for children, eggs or pancakes.
The service is okay, does take a while to get a hold of ur server, I don't notice the tourists that everyone talks about there. The lighting is a bit dim but I like it that way, feels more intimate and cozy."}
{"text":"Set your eggspectations low. Food is OK, many choices and standard quality. But the service is extremely unorganized and slow. It took forever at each point, I don't know if they are understaffed or don't have a system figured out, but everything that could go wrong service-wise, went wrong. Having breakfast at eggspectations is a once in a lifetime experience for me, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Two friends & I came here for lunch on a Saturday, around 1:30. It was packed, people were lined up at the door waiting for a table. We were put on a wait list and told it'd be about 20 minutes. About 5 minutes later, a table was already ready! A very pleasant surprise. I had french toast & a cappuccino. The french toast was delicious, loved that it came with some fruit, but the cappuccino is what really stood out- it was fantastic.

The waiter was very friendly, but disappeared for long periods of time (perhaps because it was so busy). The decor is quite pretty, and the whole restaurant is very bright and refreshing, only complaint is that it was quite noisy, I could barely hear my friend beside me.

The smoothies look incredible (as did the cocktails). I'll definitely be returning to try them."}
{"text":"Eggspectations met!

This place definitely hit the spot for my first and last mornings in Montreal.

Can't say there are any bad choices here. Everything looks delicious as I shared 3 different entrees on 2 visits here.

Nothing necessarily stood out for me to recommend, but all were solid choices. (French toast, regular benedict, mushroom crepes)
Huge selection for benedicts, breakfast entrees and lunch options!

Orange juice was freshly squeezed and was fresh! 

Free WiFi as you dine in so that's a plus! Place is very popular with locals and visitors so be wary of that.

Reasonable prices! Second time dining in the waitress was a bit rude and her attitude made us feel like a burden and unwelcomed. 

Worth checking out if the line isn't too long!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. I had an omelet and a bloody Mary. Drink was okay but not made real well. Worth the walk and a great place to grab breakfast. Manager even came by to check in on us. Service was fast and attentive. Definatly somewhere I'd stop back by."}
{"text":"Great fresh food. Went in around 1pm and there was 45 min. wait otherwise wpuldve given 5 stars! But it was worth the wait"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch last Saturday when visiting Montreal for the weekend! Place was packed. My husband ordered the eggs Benedict and I ordered the veggie omelette. We also got the French toast! We ordered way too much food as usual! Food was nothing amazing to be honest, I wouldn't be running back again! No real atmosphere here either that would attract us to return. I feel like there is better places to eat brunch in Montreal but downtown doesn't have a lot of options!"}
{"text":"Customer service could use a bit more work in terms of communication. 

Came here for Sunday Brunch - the good news is that we were seated quickly.   The bad news is that everything went down hill from there. 

This place is so disorganized, that I am surprised that they haven't gotten more complaints over their service 

Everything about this experience was just awful and I would go 0 stars, if I could. From being completely ignored, to them losing our orders; Eggspectations just comes out the losing side on all viewable perspectives. 

To be fair, our server tried to apologize for the fact that we were apparently seated in no man's land of the restaurant - so we didn't have an assigned server (might just have been our table - since the tables on either side of us got their water & service before we did). 

The husband had to pull someone aside to ask for service after waiting patiently for 20 minutes for anyone to come by and this was after we had tried getting any servers attention so we could order; only to see the ones in the close proximity clearly ignoring us. 

Once we did get our orders in, the server tried to apologize by way of saying oh well l know you are upset, but technically this isn't my section and I don't know who is supposed to looking after this section.  (Service tip: if you don't know - find out and tell them they have people in their section waiting for service. Also, at the very least, acknowledge your customers)

Fast forward another 20 minutes, food still hasn't arrived - no one has come to check up on us to see how we are doing and no refills on the husband's coffee. By this time, I was more than a little pissed off and annoyed. When our \"server\" came by to tell us the kitchen lost our order and he couldn't explain what happened. At this point, I have more or less lost my patience with this place and the nonsense. We just told them to charge us for the coffee and left.  I will give the server credit for waiving the coffee charge. But that is about it. 

The good news is that they were busy - so I am sure that my review will not count for much in the long run. But I would not recommend this place at all for a Sunday brunch on a long weekend in the summer, unless you want to waste,at least, an hour of your time with absolutely nothing to show for it."}
{"text":"I am so enamored with Toronto and all of its people.  This amazing restaurant was exquisite!  I enjoyed the friendly demeanor of all of the staff, the great waitress service and the delicious combination of dishes.

I ordered a BLT  on a bagel with a fried egg inside, which was suggested it be put on the side, because i wanted it over easy- great idea!  I would have preferred a bit more lettuce and tomatoes. 

Overall amazing!!"}
{"text":"first timer here. nice and urbanized atmosphere. good location. excellent food. nice employees and good service."}
{"text":"Really good for every day breakfast.  Love the variety of options from Bennie with Benefits, Bravacado and fruit or quinoa instead of potatoes."}
{"text":"This place is good, but not amazing. I don't make plans to come here for breakfast but if I'm around, this place is always satisfactory.

I was here last 2 days ago (Sunday around noon) with a friend visiting Montreal and we ended up having brunch here. She is very selective with the foods that she eats, so the menu was perfect because it is extensive and offers many dish variations e.g. pancakes with fruits only or pancakes with the all-American breakfast plate. There is definitely something for all tastes and cravings. My only complaint is that every single smoothie contains bananas, which I can't eat.

We were sitting on the terrace which was nice because it was nice and sunny. In retrospect, I shouldn't have accepted the waitress' offer to sit on the sunny side of the terrace. Although it wasn't excruciatingly hot, after sitting there for a while, the sun and heat become uncomfortable. 

The waiters were constantly moving around with chairs, reorganizing the terrace and this was distracting. At least, we didn't have to wait to get seated and the lineup never seemed to get long enough to really call it a lineup.

The food was good, not great. The potatoes are actually very good (many other breakfast places have disappointing potatoes in my opinion). The bacon was a little crunchy for my taste. The fruits were fresh and juicy.

Overall, I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could. Everything about this place is alright, nothing really stands out, whether good or bad. So I will keep coming whenever I'm downtown and in need of brunch for a decent price."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is consistently good. About every third or fourth visit it is very good; worthy of four stars. 

It can get pretty crowded here for breakfast, especially on weekends, so I'd make sure you are not too hungry before you get here. 

The only problem is trying to decide what to order off the giant menu. 

Fresh squeeze orange juice is a plus."}
{"text":"Arrived at 11 and got seated around 12. Service at the table was fast and friendly. My lobster benny and mimosa were greaaaaat! My moms' heavenly crepe was a bit plain and dry, while the salad on the side was good. Will come back!"}
{"text":"A friend brought me here for breakfast as it was my last day in beautiful Montreal. Once I figured out the street naming Ouest/Est convention I finally found it! 

We were greeted and seated pretty immediately but it seemed to be pretty busy inside. Since this was the morning after lots of drinks, I wasn't TOO hungry so my friend and I shared an omelet. He also let me try his orange juice which was amazing and fresh squeezed. Errr, I stuck with water though, you know, being the morning after and all.

I cannot remember the name of the omelet we got but it was REALLY good, stuffed with sausage and veggies, it was big enough to share. Also on the side were a few pieces of fruit and some roasted potatoes which were also REALLY good!

Lastly, I love the name of it, very cute!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time while on a family trip to Toronto. Service was good, and food was excellent. My husband is a hollandaise sauce snob, so it's nice to find a place that meets his standards."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning and it was popping! However, the space is large and we were seated relatively quickly. The ambiance feels very airy and fresh with high ceilings and wood and cloth seating (though they still have the classic paper place mats present at all breakfast places...which I hadn't really wonder about until now...).

I got a bagel breakfast sandwich and it was good,  with fresh ingredients, a lightly toasted bun and without the addition of an sauces (which happens at about 60% of chain restaurants even though I consistently ask for no sauce). Coffee poured freely, and waters were filled quickly. The pancakes and waffles and omelet were also delicious! 

It's a nice place, and I think I might come back for breakfast basics if I was in the mood."}
{"text":"Nice place.
Nothing really yummy but good in prices and comfy.
They were very nice with mi toddler and I appreciate it.
I went twice and the bagels are big but like I said, nothing awesome.
Good place that open early and nothing more."}
{"text":"Been back here twice since our short stay in Montreal so far.  The server Nikita is amazing!  Such great service and the food is so good! Plus they start serving alcohol at 8!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent brunch and decent pricing! The drinks here are good, I got the smoothie and the mocha drink. Fruit waffles wasnt anything much special but still filling and lots of fruit topped on the house waffle"}
{"text":"This place is right downtown Montreal. Perfect downtown view! Food and service were good!"}
{"text":"I keep reading review with 1  stars 2 amd 3 stars are not accurate this is definitely at least 4 star on Yelp place for breakfast. Yes they have creperies all over mom n pop places but this is some really good food which hit the spot for 3 of us. Bagel n lox was super good and delicious, salmon Benny was great my favorite with eggs Benedict over toast with a really nice side of fruit. My cross fit super healthy friend that eats just nuts and berries loved poached eggs over grilled chicken with a side of fruits. He loved it and had it 2 days in a row. We also had grapefruit juices which were great along with coffee which was really good as well. Belgian waffles we tried were delicious with real maple syrup and strawberries.. Really nice atmosphere great location and most importantly great service.. What's not to love about this place!! Please bring this place to jersey IHOP HAS NOTHING ON THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Visited twice for for breakfast while in Montréal! Delicious food and great service. Portions are huge! French toast is a treat, made with their homemade brioche. And served with Canadian maple syrup, of course!"}
{"text":"This is a brunch/ breakfast restaurant. When my friend and I arrived here, the patio was filled and the restaurant inside was packed. The wait list took about 20 minutes. The table we were seated at saw the front of the kitchen, which was nice and smelt delicious. The decor of this place was filled with wooden walls, which reminded me of a cabin. They also had  little picture hanging on the walls. 

The food was moderate. Nothing extremely special. I ordered \"Californian Dreamin' \" along side a Margarita. I forgot what my friend ordered but it was similar to mine but without the bread and she had a raspberry mojito. Each dish costed $11.50 and each drink was $7.50. The total of the bill was $47.23 after tax and tips. For the price I personally did not think the food was worth it. My most disappointed thing about the food was that my eggs had egg shells in it. I ended up swallowing most the small ones, but was able to take out a big piece. 

The service of this place was fast paced. However with that said, it felt like I was being ignored. Maybe it was due to the fact it was very busy and it was hot out so they paid more attention to the people outside on the patio. 

Overall the experience was nice, but I probably won't be coming back. My final thoughts of this place is that the food was mediocre and I could most definitely find a breakfast/ brunch place closer to my home for the same prices."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was a bit of a pain (English pain, not a piece of bread) but my waitress did not bat an eye when I asked if I could get milk for my tea (when she'd already given me some) or when I asked for a glass of ice (un glass de glacé?) because I had slept in a dry hotel room last night.

But, when I came back the next day, she remembered and asked me if I needed it again. No one ever remembers me.  I am sad, and they made me happy. 

The food isn't quite up to the same level as the service, but could it hope to be? I mean, the food is good, and the sugar shack breakfast I got was awesome. I could have ditched the potatoes and had more baked beans instead.  Oh, I love baked beans."}
{"text":"I find the brunch scene at Toronto kind of average at best. At Eggspectation, the menu is super diverse, the atmosphere is lively (and can be too noisy at times), and the service is pretty prompt. I just think the food here is nothing special, and I'm not a big fan of how cafeteria-style the decor is. 

You do get bottomless coffee if you order their house blend, so that's a bonus. As well, the food arrives quite quickly. If you come by earlier during the day there shouldn't be a lineup- when we left the restaurant at 11:30, there was such a long queue of people at the door! 

I didn't really like my 'yolk around the clock' because it was just some tasteless cheese melted over bagels. The eggs benedict was nothing special either, and it didn't have fries to soak up the egg yolk. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Had the bagel breakfast sandwich and it was delicious! Friends had French toast and eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce which he said was amazing. Service was good. The food took long to arrive, but it was worth the wait. FYI, even though it's Canada, they serve American bacon  ok with me! If you're in town, I recommend you to stop in. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great service, lovely atmosphere, mediocre food/ice coffee. They have a lot of good options so would come back to try the rest and love not having to wait in line on a Sunday afternoon brunch as the restaurant is very large."}
{"text":"Quick service, decent sandwich. Waitstaff was pretty disaffected though. Not too pricey. I remember this place being a better when I was in Montreal 4 years ago. Ah well. Maybe I'm just disappointed because the top floor was closed and we had to sit downstairs."}
{"text":"Very good chain of breakfast places.   The waitress was smiley, efficient and helpful.  

We got some basic egg breakfast dishes....all good...all big plates.

They have a large menu with lots of choices, from pancakes to crepes, to eggs, omelettes, etc...you will not be disappointed...   My Belgian waffle with fresh fruit was awesome...every bite of fruit was fresh tasting.   Beautiful presentation ...."}
{"text":"With me, its usually either serious love, or burning hatred.

And while i dont quite feel burning hatred for Eggspectations, this  feeling certainly is not love.

First off - the name.  I just cant with that name.  Seriously?  Eggspectations?

Second, as mentioned by a bunch of others - this place is always packed to the brim. And in my experience, this has always resulted in sardine can/sauna like conditions.    Kind of gross, and way too loud.  Especially when all I came here to do was shake away my hangover ills.

And my third gripe?  The food is majorly meh.  Its not good and its not bad.  I think that angers me more than if something straight up sucks...because at least something that sucks conjures up a few intense emotions.  this place is the culinary equivalent of a quaalude.  

The benedicts Ive had here have been pretty forgettable (ive had the Florentine, the Classic and the California), and the scrambled eggs - quite run of the mill.  I couldnt really tell you anything \"eggstraordinary\" about the grilled potatoes.  Theyre grilled.  Potatoes,

If you like you can come over to my place instead, and ill let you pay me $15 a head to sit in my laundry room in July while I whip up some scrambled eggs and white toast for you.

I dont get why this place is so popular - but i guess some of you like it.  You could certainly do worse - but with so many exciting options out there - you should be doing better."}
{"text":"Good food.   We had eggs Benedict, French toast from the Ala cart, Belgium waffles.-    all good.

Service was good.  Happy waiters who smile.

Nice space.   

I suggest sharing the dishes.  The portion sizes are pretty good."}
{"text":"Not entirely certain this is the Eggspectations I went to in Spring '10 but since it's a chain I'm putting my review down anyways(if memory serves right there's one by Place Des Arts). 
The decor is very over the top outlandish/fairytale, perfect for kids. 
The menu is full of puns on the word egg, very cute. 
Even though this place was regularly packed every day we walked by my group of four got a booth fairly quickly and got down to ordering. 
I think each person had some sort of crepe with the real hungry guys going for the larger servings thereof. The portions are huge, I think I only got through half my meal. It's cute that there's that bit of fresh fruit plucked down next to an artery busting breakfast. 
This place is a chain, and it's touristy, and I was a tourist who enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Just average, the bagels with eggs had a bad bagel.  The prices are too high for what you expect.  The omelette is average."}
{"text":"Came here on Canada day, amazing food and even better service by Bennett. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Our breakfast experience was unfortunately terrible. We found this place on a neighborhood walk around our hotel and this was our experience:
-greeted and sat immediately by a friendly hostess
-sat for 15 mins without acknowledgment by any other restaurant staff. 
-I eventually flagged down a server who acted annoyed that I asked her to take our order. Watched the same thing happen to at least 5 other tables that were sat around the same time as U.S.
-food arrived not long after we ordered. Unfortunately I received the wrong order and had to basically argue with the server to get it corrected. 
-eventually I spoke with a manager who apologized. He brought our bill and had given us 50% discount. Appropriate considering our experience thus far. After flagging down our server to notify her we were ready to pay we still had to wait 15 mins to run our cards and get out of there.


I have compassion for businesses that are slammed and for whatever reason understaffed, and it's all in how they manage the situation. I do not, however have compassion for servers and staff that are rude to their customers for no reason. If you are busy, acknowledge it and thank your guest for their patience. Very simple solve."}
{"text":"Ordered eggs florentine and tropical juicE. The food was great with decent portions. Pretty packed on the weekends. Would rate the service average since the guy kept checking on us every five minutes so that he could clear the table -_-. Apart from that, loved the place and would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I got the Lobster Benny at another Yelper's recommendation. I have to say it is a no go. They are not skimpy on the lobster but it would be an exaggeration to say they are generous. Also, the eggs benedict has a little to much butter. Now what I would say is get their fresh juices, they are excellent! I think the one I got was the Living Green."}
{"text":"This place is not what I eggspected. The food taste just like diner food, nothing special, mediocre at best. It didn't WOW us. Don't have any eggspectations if you plan to dine here."}
{"text":"The name is just plain horrible and cheesy.  It looks like there are a few in Montreal so I guess its a chain, something akin to IHOP.  The menu leans more towards the American palate (the bacon they serve is the American version, not Canadian).  Egg choices abound and there are a lot of combo choices (french toast, eggs etc.)

There are low fat options for all omelettes and you can sub out the potatoes with fresh fruit salad which is really nice.  Good choice for Americans who want a taste of home but probably not the place to get an authentic French Canadian breakfast.  A OK."}
{"text":"While in Toronto, my boyfriend and I Yelp'd breakfast near where we were staying and came across Eggspectation. I would recommend making a reservation because the wait time for 2 people on a Saturday was about 45 minutes.

The restaurant was packed with tables about 2 inches from each other but we didn't mind because it gave us an opportunity to sneak a pic at what others were eating. 

I ordered the Belgian waffles and my boyfriend ordered French toast which was served with potatoes, eggs and bacon. The waffles were great and my boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well. 

Overall great brunch but I would definitely make a reservation next time."}
{"text":"My second time eating here. My first time trying the Benedict with benefits. It was simply great!! The eggs were cooked to perfection. Sitting on multigrain toast, tomatoes and brie. Finally topped off with a hollandaise sauce. I feel great after eating this and am ready to seize the day. Also came with some fruits which is nice. 

Next time I'm going to have to try the classic eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints... A little bit of a wait to get in on A Sunday morning but that is to be expected! Eggs Benedict was great! My dad had the pancake stacker and said it was excellent! The fresh squeezed OJ is delicious and service was exemplary! A go to for breakfast for me any time I am in Toronto, Ottawa, or Montreal."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast and the potatoes are so delicious!!!! Kept us full right through dinner. Going again today before heading home."}
{"text":"hello everyone! i love eating here! i love andrea at the door, she brightens my day as soon as i see her smile. The service is awesome and i will definatly come again. thank u!"}
{"text":"LOBSTER BENNY IS OFF DA FREAKIN CHAIN!!!!!
First of dam all, the hollandaise sauce takes this dish over the top! Nevah tasted anything like it! Then they had the audacity to cook my poached eggs 'medium' to PERFECTION!!!(no one ever seems to get it right! lol)
I was literally trying to sop up all the remaining hollandaise sauce with the potatoes i had left! 
my only complaint is that they don't start serving mimosas until 11am( but i guess they have to obey the law)"}
{"text":"A nice and cool simple brunch spot in the downtown area. It is located within a shopping complex. The restaurant has lots of seating (2 floors). The menu offers lots of food. But we stuck with the eggs and some french toast. Both were really delicious. The pricing is also very affordable and really worth it for the portion."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I've been here so many times its actually embarrassing. The wait staff is attractive and friendly and hip. The place is beautiful and gets good sunlight. The food is very well made and they even care about its appearance, however what matters at the end of the day is the taste, and their food really is spectacular. It is a chain, so don't expect a mom and pop feel, but despite this fact the food is very tasty and the menu is eclectic. The range of the cuisine is admirable. 

Recommend: their mimosas and sangria  (not sure if seasonal) were out of this world 

ANYTHING in their Benedict section is phenomenal. 

Their hardy platters are good as well and all of their sandwiches so far have been satisfactory."}
{"text":"We are in love!! This place is the reason breakfast is the most important meal of the day:) Christian had the Greek omelet , which exploded with favors so fresh and unique it makes you wonder what was wrong others we have had. 
I had the lobster eggs Benedict with a side of smoked salmon. Wow ... It was incredible! The salmon was so fresh and smoked even Christian enjoyed it!!( note Christian can't even stand the smell of salmon, says a lot.. Lol)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The perfect breakfast post-skate at Nathan Phillips.  Atmosphere is bright and warm with jazz in the background.  Service is impeccable and we are remembered every time we come in, even as to what we ordered the last time.  Meals are beautifully presented as well and taste great. We will continue to be repeat patrons!"}
{"text":"Got the Montreal Benedict, Classic Benedict, Fruit Pancakes, and the fruit smoothies! The smoothies were pretty healthy tasting (meaning not that sweet), but overall the food was amazing! The eggs benedict were really good and the potatoes that came with it were amazing as well! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The service here is great and I love that they take reservations.  I reserved for 12 people and they had the table setup all ready, even when I came 20 minutes early.  They sat me and were patient with my tardy group.  The location is a bit difficult to find as the address implies that it is on Bay St. when it is actually around the corner on Albert St.  (Note: it is not in the Bell Trinity Center building).

I had a smoothie and their sunset omelette that had sour cream and ripe avocado on the top and found it delicious.  I also ordered a poutine, which was disappointing because it was too salty and didn't have enough gravy on it.  The service was friendly and given that we took over 2 hours to order and eat, they didn't make too much of a fuss about that.  There was also no fuss over getting separate bills either.

Overall, the food was good but the real reason why I am giving this place 4 stars is the service and the atmosphere.  The high glass windows allows natural sunlight to shine through, the decor of the place was nice and the tables were not too packed together."}
{"text":"US Californian review here !

Well, this was our final place to eat before heading to the airport. Sad, but what an enjoyable breakfast. 

You can spot the restaurant from the street but the entrance is actually inside the shopping center. You will get seated by a hostess. It's spacious and it does have a table to fit 6+ right in the middle if you have a big party. 

I ordered the breakfast burger with French fries. It comes w/ roasted potatoes so if you want French fries, you have to specifically ask. 

Food was delicious. No complaints at all. Great breakfast place to stop by if you're looking for one. I would definitely come back if given the opportunity."}
{"text":"Excellent eggs Bennie, daughter had GF option which was on a tomato, good portions, nice fruit salad with hers, grilled potatoes with mine!  Only negative is we found the coffee weak.  The deck on this day was grand!"}
{"text":"After being declined to make reservations for a party of 12 at Fran's Restaurant, we called Eggspectation instead and were quickly assured we would have a table ready next week for our brunch. 
On the day of the brunch our party of 12 dropped in one by one but the staff were very accomodating and waited until the whole party  was present to take our orders. There was a big variety of food on the menu and everyone found something they loved. Food came out quickly and everyone emptied their plates. 
A good experience, especially compared to not even being able to reserve a table at Fran's. I would definitely recommend Eggspectation for brunch or lunch!"}
{"text":"Don't come here for weekend brunch if you have a group. Went here with 7 and a small baby and waited for 40minutes. Multiple groups were seated before us and the hostess couldn't figure out how to seat us. She eventually called the manager after 30minutes. The final nail in the coffin of this moribund experience was the staff's refusal to ask some lingering long-satiated customers to relinquish their table. It was like going to one of those Service Ontario places, but in addition to the long lines and lack of attention there is the aroma of brunch that you can't eat. Like Tantalus in Greek mythology, except that he's also carrying a heavy hungry baby."}
{"text":"Ok....so here it is in a nutshell.  This is a tourist trap!  Definitely not worth the wait.  They have sub-par service and at best edible food.  If you are in the mood to feel like cattle being herded through a breakfast routine, then this is the place for you.  If you are a pancake or French Toast lover, then DO NOT order them from here.  They pile all of your food on top of them and once you get to them they taste like the food you already ate....highly disappointing:(  Did I mention this place is a tourist trap!"}
{"text":"Salmon beneditct and benedict florentine, perfectly executed - subbed the potatoes and fruit for a tomatoes.  Washed it down with cappucino.

Eggspectations all around the city."}
{"text":"I can't count the number of times I've walked by this place and turned up my nose like some downtown asshole. A breakfast chain? Please.

It turns out I'm an idiot.

The service here is some of the best I've experienced in years, particularly downtown. Quick, attentive, and overwhelmingly polite; after delivering a pair of Americanos to our table, the server noticed they looked a little \"thin.\" So she scooped them right back up and had them replaced with new ones that were dark and foamy - not the best I've ever had, granted, but I'm just some downtown asshole.

The food was terrific. I had perfectly cooked bacon and eggs, everything great right down to the toast. (This shouldn't be hard, but based on experiences elsewhere, it is!) My girlfriend loved her classic eggs Benedict. The homemade hollandaise was \"the best I've ever had\" and she even specifically praised the English muffin.

This is, hands down, my new favourite downtown weekend brunch spot. It's definitely worth checking out, and anyone who says otherwise is... well, you know."}
{"text":"Really busy on Sunday morning. Good location. Fresh squeezed orange juice was definitely fresh and good. Had the southwest omelette which was very filling and good favors. Had an entire basket of toast which helped with being hungover. Would eat there again."}
{"text":"FOOD: 5 stars. My food was amazing. I ordered a meal that essentially boils down to pancakes, bacon, sausage, eggs, and potatoes. But Eggspectation does it a bit differently in that all the items were STACKED. A bottom pancake with bacon on top, flanked by a middle pancake with sausage, and finally another pancake topped with an egg. It was delicious. Not an especially novel concept but combined with the absurdly delectable 100% pure Canadian syrup, this was a winner.

VALUE: 4 stars. The price wasn't too bad, but this was close to the most expensive breakfast I had on my trip to Montreal. To be honest, any restaurant can make the brunch Eggspectation does, but I won't knock off too many points, considering the mood and ambiance of their outdoor seating is pretty top-notch.

SERVICE: 3 stars. Our waiter wasn't the friendliest. I legitimately don't think he smiled a single time. When I asked for a straw, he seemed mildly annoyed and brought me one without the wrapper. That was kind of strange.

TL;DR VERDICT: 4 stars. The food is great and the atmosphere is so Montreal, and despite a higher-than-average price and a blistering waiter who shall remain nameless, I'll be back if I ever visit the Royal Mountain."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast before we headed to Niagra Falls. I found it on yelp and it had a good amount of stars and it was near our hotel. The service our table had was slow. I watched parties come and go within the time we were seated. I don't understand why that was. But it happened. I had the eggsuberant. The pancake were heavy. I was hoping they would be lite and fluffy.  I enjoyed my eggs, and the potatoes were cool. The sausage was decent. Nothing exciting here, decent food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"A lot of options and all delicious! Very easy to combine sweet and salty. Kind service and not waiting in line :)

Ps: * Amazing hollandaise sauce!"}
{"text":"Your run-of-the-mill all day breakie.  This is a popular restaurant that's situated right by the Eaton Centre and draws diverse crowds including tourists. It's a chain, so I can't say that there's much heart here, but the location is convenient.

The menu here is pretty sizeable, so you can tweak your order to your liking (e.g. add side orders).  Prices aren't too bad, and you can fill up easily for $10.  The service is pretty straight-up and quick enough. Come here alone, with your significant other or bring the whole gang; there's room for everyone!  

Not a bad place to hang and people watch either, if you get a table for two right by the windows."}
{"text":"I remember visiting the old Eggspectation on Yonge and wasn't overly impressed. When they opened up their new location at 483 Bay, I also recall not being impressed. I didn't know what the hype was as I always saw a full house when I walked by on weekends, and quite busy during the weekdays.

Since I was in the area today and needed breakfast, we decided to pop into the restaurant. The new location's decor is much nicer, modern and rustic feel. We got seated in a comfortable booth in the corner. 

The restaurant has tons of breakfast options on the menu. We decided to go for just the french toast with fruits and the all American breakfast. The french toast was delicious and done very well. I loved the all American. It came with sausage, bacon and ham, beans, two eggs, little fruit and toast. I thought it was great value for what you get. 

I really enjoyed my breakfast and can see why they have a full house all the time. Their patio is also great in the Summer time! Glad Eggspectation has improved since my last few visits."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Canada . Plenty to choose from, WIFI and great coffee. Always good service and very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place with plenty of options and friendly service. The decor is quite cute as well! I have the omlette with avocado and cheese ( perfect size ) and their coffee is amazing! 

What else is there to say, it is a great breakfast place in the city!"}
{"text":"Today I went to eggspectation and I get disappointed of the food. Before I was love this place but since z time I feel they lost them  tasty food. I try them poutine for 7,95$ no taste to much sauce and very small same size of my baby plate. I took for my baby 2 years old penne of cheese for 5,99$ and it was so small and not that good. I dont think I will goo again soon"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this location after leaving another restaurant with a wait time that was too long for my growling stomach to handle. My friends and I loved the food and made sure to go again before leaving Montreal. The staff was very friendly and kept pace with the huge crowd that filled the place. I'd recommend this (or any eggspectation) to anyone seeking a delicious yet affordable breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by someone who was there before and I was happy I followed this recommendation. I am surprised by one star review people gave this place, because my experience was excellent. The restaurant is clean and waiters are friendly and helpful. The restaurant was full of couples, families with kids, and tourists. We were there for breakfast and brunch two days in a row. They serve a freshly squeezed orange juice, which something I do not get to taste often in NYC restaurants. Greek yogurt with fruits and honey was exquisite: fresh thick yogurt topped with strawberries, bananas, blueberries, and raspberries. Yum! Also, French toast was absolutely delicious, so if it does not come with your dish, please order it from a la cart menu. I also had Eggsuberant (eggs, potatoes, pancakes with Maple syrup): delish! My friend had Montreal style omelette. Pretty much everything on the menu looked good and based on my experience, I am guessing it tastes good as well. Next time I am visiting Montreal, I am there!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place for brunch! I was so glad we were able to make a stop here during our visit to Toronto. 

The place has ample seating, inside and outside. The menu has SO much on it so no matter how picky you are, you're bound to find something good. We had the Salmon Eggs Benedict, the French toast and the Southwest Sunrise Omelette. All the plates are sized well and either loaded with fruit other than boring melon (you know that a side of fruit usually means melons and more melons at most places) or potatoes. Everything was really delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service.  Located just a couple blocks from the Notre Dame Basilica a quick check of Yelp had us on our way.  As this is a chain, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but was really impressed.  To be honest what moved the needle to a 5 star review of this place was our waiter.  I wish I could remember his name because quite simply he kicked ass in every respect.  He was quick with getting us drinks, and answered any questions we had on the menu as well as provided us with some recommendations.  In addition he offered up the WiFi password since we were on our phones searching out where we were going to explore that day.  He then proceeded to bring over a small map and give us some ideas as well as helped us with the times some places were open.  Over the top GREAT service!!!  

On to the food.  I had the High Rise Pancakes which consists of three Pancakes with bacon and sausage between each layer along with a side of their home fried potatoes.  My wife went with the Eggs Benedict and my daughter Pancakes and bacon.  Everything came out nice and hot.  The Pancakes were nice and fluffy, the bacon thick cut and the sausage delicious.  Pretty much a perfect diner'esque experience s to start off our day.  Luckily we did a lot of walking that day to help offset that carb bomb I so happily consumed!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would do it. Eggspectation had a very hip and rustic atmosphere. The employees were very personable, especially my fiancé and I's waiter who was funny and extremely kind. I don't remember his name but I know he was bald, probably in his 30s, and was very social and polite. The service was incredible. I got the walnuttella pancake and my fiancé got a Belgian waffle with chocolate chips. Both were perfect. My pancake was the best pancake I've ever eaten. Banana and walnut were cooked into the pancake and it was topped with Nutella. Needless to say it did not last long. This place is a must if you are visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast spot.

Good prices
A good amount of selections for breakfast, sandwiches, and dinner items. 
They offer a good variety of breakfast and eggs.
Fresh squeezed OJ was fresh.
The bread ain't bad. They give you a good selection of jams.



Not too oily on the food. 
Good service.
Good easy to get to location in downtown. 


I would eat here for bunch any day."}
{"text":"Great lively place to have an enormous brunch. As a New Yorker there's nothing I love more than a good brunch on a Saturday morning. 

I was seated quickly and the waitress came by immediately to say hi, though they were really busy. The coffee came quickly, as did the food. 

The California Benny was great. A huge mound of potatoes with spinach, smoked salmon and asparagus on top of whole wheat toast with a classic hollandaise sauce. Plus there was a little fresh fruit on the side.  I couldn't finish it all, but I prefer that to not getting enough from a brunch place! 

It's not a fancy place, but the amount of choice and friendly, fun atmosphere are excellent and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Tasty. Granted we went there mid day but I'm still waiting on the waitress as I have been the entire time here. And we are the only table here currently. Slow AF"}
{"text":"I had to give myself a week to calm down and not leave an ugly review for this place; it's been 2 and I am still scarred by my experience here. 

The \"food\" is absolutely inedible. Pancakes were burnt and hard, waffles were not even close to moist or soft, even the fruit were sour and not ripe. Don't order the mimosas, the pulp and cheap champagne didn't work. To make matters way worse, we had to wait almost one whole hour for the food to come out and there were only two parties (our group of 8 and another group of 8-10). No servers were ever seen on the floor except when brining out the food so if you needed water or anything else, best of luck to you my friend. 

I normally never leave poor reviews because I don't ever want to intentionally hurt a business, but the food and service was so awful that I'd feel even worse if people actually wasted their time and money here."}
{"text":"This is a great location and vey convenient. There's a little something for everyone. The food is great and they have fast service."}
{"text":"really nice eggs benedict but would prefer an english muffin rather than wholemeal slice of bread"}
{"text":"I was staying downtown for the night and wanted to get a decent breakfast the next morning. I quickly found it on Yelp and gave it a try since it wasn't to far from Yonge and Dundas where I was staying. It was ok with a lot of interesting menu items and was quite busy -- but not busy enough to have a wait time to be seated which was good. Food was decent and came quick and the hostess was quiet but did a very good job of taking care of us... had moderate pricing and decent portions. Would go again no complaints."}
{"text":"Grab the day by the eggs! The motto hasn't resonated more at any other restaurant. With mouth watering food, friendly staff, (fairly) economical pricing, and a taste of Montreal, eggspectation really brings it's A-Game to the brunch scene! Easily my favourite brunch spot near the Garden and Discovery district, I'm at a loss at finding a brunch place that makes omelettes as delicious as they do! 

My usual is generally the Smoked Salmon Benny or the Southwest Sunrise Omelette with some toast on the side along with a fresh juice! 10/10 would recommend it to any person trying this place for the first time. Their lobster is a little on the expensive side but worth every penny! Whatever you do, do NOT try the burgers or the Mac and cheese, it may seem like a worthy add-on to your meal, but it'll just leave you disappointed... It's a brunch place. Do your brunchin'
This place is packed from 11-12ish, so expect a wait time for at least 15-20 minutes (and they don't accept reservations on weekends around that time either)
Other than that, love the food, love the people (Shout-out to my usual server - Ben who knows what I want as soon as I walk in) and the ambience for the place really makes me feel like I'm in Montreal!

PS Their tea cups are adorable. It's from a Montreal chain called My Cup of Tea! (In case you wanna buy it!)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast we had while in Toronoto !we had to come here two days in a row !  Will definitely be back our next stay ! Great ,fresh food and great service !"}
{"text":"My girlfriend loved this place and was one of her top picks for brunch in downtown Toronto! The parking can get a bit confusing in the structure, but their smoothies here are amazing! Their entrees are good, but I only wish they gave you more of the eggs that they are famous for and less of the meats/pancakes. However, service was great and they even had wifi!"}
{"text":"Food was bland, but okay. Nothing wrong with it, just not great. There's no way they're using real maple syrup (or it's been really watered down).

 The real problem was the service. Just comically bad. Just sitting there waiting for coffee. Towards the end our waitress notices we're done and then disappears for 20 min. I really don't get it. 

Will never come back."}
{"text":"I recently visited Montreal last week (Oct7-11) Stayed at the Hyatt Regency Montreal which is next to Eggspectation. I ate there at least once a day! Great food and service! Even the manager waits tables and is very frendly. Best French toast ever!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! I went here for breakfast and the food was spectacular. I got a Rose-Mimosa and Chicken and Waffles with a fruit cup! I definitely recommend that everyone goes here once! The service was espectacular!"}
{"text":"It's okay. 

It's not a greasy spoon. And it's not tasty enough to be a go-to lunch spot. 

Tasteless, and pricey for the kind of breakfast food they serve. But the variety of other NON-EGG dishes makes it better."}
{"text":"This past Sunday was my first time at Eggspectation for brunch. We were quoted about 50 minutes for a table-- (they use the yelp wait list so make sure you get on there before showing up)! The wait moved quickly and we received a text saying our table was ready before the 50 minutes was over. 

My friend ordered chocolate chip pancakes which were served with real maple syrup and a side of their version of \"home fries\". I was torn between the California Benedict and Eggs Florentine and upon the waiter's suggestion I chose the Florentine. Overall the flavoring in our food was delicious. The Eggs Florentine was served with potatoes and a few pieces of fruit while the pancakes had butter and powdered sugar. Both of us enjoyed our meals but the eggs for the florentine were overcooked. I always look forward to the runny yolks in my eggs Benedict's,  but this one was more of a soft boiled egg than poached. 

Aside from the high prices, soft boiled eggs, and long wait the atmosphere was pleasant and our server was great. I would definitely give this place another try and perhaps pick a sweet breakfast instead!"}
{"text":"Great food selection. Even better taste! Came in for breakfast. Coffee and Mocha were great. Service was top notch. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I was here for breakfast today on a school trip and the waiters completely forgot about my order and we had to wait over an hour to get our food as we watched others eat around us. The one star is because my pancakes were pretty good."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype here is all about. Some of my friends swear on this place and talk about it non-stop. It's just a regular breakfast / brunch place. Perhaps I'm just not a brunch person. Anyway, been there, done that, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Such a classic fun place for Brunch!

The first time in Toronto and the first time at Eggspectation and I had the Egg Say What? The harsh browns with the two scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese that came with a slice of cantaloupe and a slice of an orange. I absolutely loved it. I consider Eggspectation the Canadian version of IHOP but with a little more modern edge, which is a nice twist.
My mom had the Omelet with Mushrooms, Cheddar and Green Onions. Her meal also had the same fruit garnish.

Round 2 we had a 10% coupon and this time we had the blueberry pancakes ( FYI the blueberries come on the side and are not mixed in the batter). This was a large portion three large pancakes so half had to go home with us.

If I lived here I would definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Rushed in here on a rainy day and was delightfully overwhelmed by their huge menu. I tried the vegetarian omelette and was completely stuffed halfway through it. The omelette itself was average but filling and a solid breakfast. 

What I was very happy about was the lovely service. I ordered a cafe au lait which I was very unhappy about (it had a strange powdery taste). I asked the waitress for a filtered coffee and she was very sweet and removed the cafe au lait of my bill which I thought was generous. 

It's a good place if you're going with a big group because the service is fantastic and the menu has something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Love the corny but creative names for the dishes. The decor is fun -- walls are also filled with plates signed by famous people who've eaten there. Pretty much everything on the menu is delicious so feel free to get your favorite dish. Also go for the fresh squeezed orange juice which is full of pulpy deliciousness -- and get a large!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast in charming atmosphere.  I had classic eggs Benedict which was delicious, and the potatoes on the side were amazing.  Crispy & flavorful.  I loved breakfast so much, I went back for lunch and had chicken panini and a salad.  Delicious also!  The rosemary chicken was cooked perfectly & the olive oil on the panini bread added to the flavor.  A must try ! I'm from the US, and I will definitely be seeking out the closest US location. A must try in Toronto."}
{"text":"It doesn't hurt that our Great United States Dollar is KILLING the Canadian Dollar by a whopping 32%.  It was really nice seeing our bill and laughing in the back of my mind thinking \"minus 32%\". 

Toronto overall was pretty disappointing. Canadians hype this city up. I can't help but compare it to Chicago which I learned after my weekend in Toronto, that there is no longer a comparison.

Toronto shines in a very small number of places and this place is one of them. Good service. Very clean place. The location was right next door to the huge mall and not too far from our hotel.  If I ever feel the need to return to Toronto, I will make this place a \"must have\"."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Large portions so be careful how much you order.  The waffles wee excellent.  The blueberries pancakes were just OK.  Too cakey for me and not many blueberries at all.  You do get real maple syrup but that seems to be the case all over Montreal.  The fruit plate was huge and had a great assortment of fruit."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto for a few days, I had a hard time finding a great brunch place.  This place is not bad compared to the other places.  The portions were generous and food overall was tasty with some missteps such as my Benedict that was on toast.  The toast just couldn't stand up to all the runny egg yolk and hollandaise sauce. It became a big soggy messy, and no one likes soggy bread.  The kids meal was huge, and I had only very small bite of the sausage which I was not crazy about.  The pancakes, on the other hand, were good and fluffy.  Not a bad place overall."}
{"text":"Eggspectations holds a dear place in my heart, because it's the very first pun this little francophone ever understood!! I have also thought of this specific location as quite glamorous (bit I think the high-end mall surrounding it might helped a bit). It's nestled in a corner, under a large staircase, facing a waterfall (which seems out of order NOOOOO!!!). Everything is brassy and to me that just screams \"COZY!\".  Everybody is seated in little nooks and there are no obnoxious center tables anywhere.

The service is super fast and I'm not sure whether my waiter was really overzealous or just trying to get people to eat quickly so they could leave..I've noticed that they really treat you depending on your looks i.e: you have kids, they'll be great or if you are with your family, or older people the waiters really step it up a notch. 
Everything on the menu sounds delicious and I don't think you could go wrong anywhere. I had the Oy-Vegg, 3 potato latkes and 2 mirror eggs along with sour sauces and fruits.

Now, the fruit. I think shopping at marché Jean Talon has affected me too much, don't expect to be moved. It's three slices: one melon, one watermelon and the most pitifyl, unripe pineapple slice I have ever seen. But hey..
The waiter asked for white or whole bread. I was confused, my choice didn't include bread: here's the deal: the bring you 4 warm slices of toasted bread. Mmmmm.. That was one satisfying meal..."}
{"text":"J'ai mangé un uf poché dans un avocat nappé de fromage fondu et d'une sauce au tomate épicée parfaitement. Délicieux!"}
{"text":"The food here is definitely a 5 star. One of the most delicious bennies I've ever had.

We came during lunch on Friday. Place is packed but definitely not full. We ordered a smoothie (green something) and it came right away! The fact that the smoothie started to seperare after couple minutes is comforting..knowing that they used real ingredients.
We ordered the lobster omlette and lobster benny. As someone who only orders bennies at diners, I had quite an expectation from this place. 

We waited for about 45 minutes and our food finally arrived. Our server did follow up with us regarding the wait time for the food, but with such a huge space and not even full, I'm sure they could've hired extra hands. The table beside us complained about the wait time as well.

The benny itself was delicious...and the lobster just made it so much better! The hollandaise was on point- not too heavy but very creamy. 

Although the wait time was ridiculously long, our server was amazing.

Will definitely be back when I'm not in a rush to head back to the office!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard breakfast fare at a most definitely tourist hub.

I ordered the Veggie Omelette. They give you a big basket of toast while you wait for the rest of your food, but I wish the toast wasn't pre-buttered.

The omelette itself is pretty big, but there wasn't much asparagus in there, and what little there was, it was just some old stalks. Potatoes were good, as was the watermelon slice, but the orange slice looked old and a bit dried.

Overall nothing extraordinary, but it was a filling breakfast that fueled me for the rest of the day (even without meat). Thumbs up!

Service was also quick and efficient. Everyone there spoke English, which is another plus for \"ignant\" Americans like me. A solid place for breakfast if you don't have time to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Ruby Foo's attached to the place for two weeks so I ate here quite a few times at different times of the day. My best experience was a Sunday morning and I ate at the bar with their best employee Alex. She was very attentive and awesome at her job. This was the first time I ate there and was looking forward to going back....and then it went downhill. 
    I had ordered French Toast one evening and it was not fully cooked in the middle. Didn't eat it but didn't have time to for them to remake it. They apologized and still charged be for it. I didn't have time to argue so I just paid the bill and left. The service was a 2/5 on this experience with my having to flag down another waiter just to get a refill. 
    A few mornings days later I ordered a eggs Benedict that was good but still had poor service. Two nights later after a long day at work I didn't feel like searching for a place nearby so I thought I would give it another chance. I ordered the French Toast meal again and specifically asked to make sure they cooked it all the way in case it was the same cook. I took two bites and made it to the middle and sure enough it was soggy and tasted like raw egg. I wasn't that hungry so i let the waiter know it was made wrong(again) but didn't want it remade. Pretty sure he didn't even mention it to the cook. Not mentioning anything I wanted to see if the would charge me for it and I was in shock when he did. Not having the energy to argue I just paid it and showed my dissatisfaction in the tip. There attentiveness was piss poor on this visit as well as I sat most of my meal with an empty drink. 
   Stopped going for a few days until the last night I was there as I didn't have the desire to drive out in a blizzard. Ordered the meal with Pancakes. Luckily this occurrence the food was great or I would have lost it. Unfortunately the service was pretty terrible as my drink was empty for 70% of the time. The place has some great($$) smoothies that are good if you are in a hurry. I would have given it one star if it weren't for such a great experience my first time. This place has a lot to learn in the front of the house and back. I was hoping they had a way to leave a survey from the receipt but no luck. Figured this would be a good place to give feedback."}
{"text":"It's one of my favourite brunch places. Their customer service is decent. However, the last time we were there (St. Catherine location), we were served by Thomas. I was really impressed by his enthusiasm and his great hospitality. He knew the menu really well and made good suggestions to not only us but also to the people around us. We were going to order 3 full dishes but he suggested that instead of ordering the 3rd full dish, we could order it as a side (small portion and cheaper). Shoutout to Thomas at the St. Catherine location!! Keep up the good work and that smile :)"}
{"text":"The BEST pancakes I've ever had- and I'm a pancake snob. My brother got the eggs Benedict (the first time we went) and they were equally delicious. We ended up going back the next day for brunch, and had some amazing picks (breakfast burger, eggspectation crepe, eggspectation bagel sandwich, and we all got the Mac & cheese to share) there was not a single thing we disliked about this place! Definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this breakfast place. Delicious mimosas and I wish I had more time in Toronto to come back and try another one of the breakfast dishes. The lunch/dinner options looked just as amazing. Good vibes and ambience, perfect for families, couples, or friends just meeting up! Delicious coffee as well. Perfectly brewed. My Sunrise Omelette was perfect and something I had never tried before!"}
{"text":"A great breakfast/brunch/hangover-recovery spot with a dizzying array of egg choices--page after page of omelettes, different types of eggs benedicts, pancakes, etc.  We enjoyed our brunch very much, despite headaches and malaise, which were not at all the fault of the restaurant!  Lots of tables inside and lots of tables outside.  A delightful place."}
{"text":"I love breakfast and for the most part, eggs are good anywhere, right? But juice ... now that can make or break your breakfast experience. And the juice at Eggspectations was phenomenal. none of that watered down bullhonkey, we're talking pulp and lots of it. 

Crepes were great, and a side of hollandaise will do anyone good. Definitely get there before 12 on Sunday otherwise you'll be in a line out the door."}
{"text":"Suprisingly filling breakfast. I love the original omelette. All dishes are served with a slice of watermelon, melon, and grapefruit. 

Definitely seems the place to be. Service was very fast and mimosa was great. Try it!"}
{"text":"checked in Saturday at 1pm - not very busy. We've got a table right away. Menu very promising for a brunch and I was not disappointed. I had the salmon benny - bennies are there speciality. My daughter pancakes page loaded with a lot of fruits and berries. Service very nice - friendly and fast. Definitely a place to go for brunch in Toronto Downtown."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why it gets such low rating. I had a great experience here with really nice staff. My check states that my server was Ricardo. He was prompt to take my order, brought my food promptly as it came up to the kitchen window, checked on me precisely 2 bites in, made sure my coffee was topped off, and presented the check promptly after I put my card down. 

The whole staff was also very friendly.

I ordered chicken and waffles and it was delicious. 

Coffee, was coffee, no new news. 

Free WiFi and nice space."}
{"text":"My crêpès bretonne are very tasty. The place is fancy, quite and spacious, with a view. The staff is not very nice, but if you are in downtown, it would be a good place to have a bruch."}
{"text":"there are so many better brunch places out there! better taste, bigger portion, more unique dishes. try something different!"}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast and nice atmosphere! We visited Eggspectation while waiting for our bus and the distance from Toronto Coach Terminal was perfect. Definitely worth trying out!

I recommend Banana Java smoothie, a great mix of espresso and milkshake."}
{"text":"Large outdoor and indoor seating, place is bright and clean.  Staff efficient, friendly and courteous.

Food was prepared quickly and ingredients were fresh. Highly recommend the Lobster Benny with large chunks of Lobster and the eggs were poached perfectly.

If you have a sweet tooth, go for the French Toast made with Brioche bread smothered in syrup,  strawberries, bananas and walnuts

Unfortunately their waffle iron was broken but the staff were quick to apologize and rectified the situation quickly and politely, very good customer service.

Sit outside on the patio, enjoy the good food and weather

My new go to place for breakfast, they also have burgers and other non breakfast items which also looked equally impressive"}
{"text":"Very nice all day breakfast place! Also has a variety of other foods from pastas and sandwiches to waffles, crepes, pancakes and salads! For veggie lovers they have a great assortment - please try the veggie crepe .... It's amazing!"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype is about this place. I came in with my girlfriend for what we expected would be an amazing brunch having read the good reviews on Yelp, and were sorely disappointed when we were presented with subpar, diner like food. 

That was seriously our experience, a glorified diner, with much more expensive prices, and with awful service to boot. Our server was impatient, rude, and clearly not interested in his work, and when we asked for any little thing, he would take like 10 minutes to get back to us. 

My omelette was very basic and bland, my potatoes boring, and my pancake just okay. Her pancakes with strawberries were also, just okay. Much ado about nothing, honestly.

I get that everyone has an off day from time to time, but this just felt like an off restaurant, overall. Save your money and go elsewhere for your breakfast or brunch needs. This place isn't anything special. In fact, it's pretty bad."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on Labor Day. Decor is funky and good for kids. Five-minute wait, no biggie. Our waiter was super accommodating and one classy guy. I'd hire him. However, they are severely understaffed. Major con. 

Coffee - good. They had almond milk. Score. 

Hot chocolate - it wasn't hot. Asked to be made again. Came out cold again. 

Montreal omelette - they let me substitute the cheese for olives. Also substituted the potatoes for quinoa for an extra fee. But the beef tasted plasticky and it was also missing the fruit that came on the side. Got it when I realized and asked for it at the end. 

Egg over hard with fruit - good and simple dish. Highly overpriced. Can make this myself for less than three dollars. 

Vegetarian omelette - great meal. Wish I'd gotten this one!"}
{"text":"Food quality was average for a chain breakfast place but service was terrible. Waited 15 minutes after being shown to our seat before server came over. It took about another 25-30 minutes to get our food and never got a coffee until food showed up. Then when we finished the server wanted to enter her own tip!  A bit overpriced as well."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a negative star but unfortunately that is not an option. the pictures on yelp look so good, I wish I got to taste the food. The reviews were pretty good so I wanted to check this place out myself. So we are in the country for a week, friend's bridal shower. our last day before our flight we walk 45 minutes to get to this place. we figured we would burn some calories, empty our bellies and be prepare for great food. Boy did eggspection had a surprise for us. first we came in, it's Sunday, august 2nd 2015. We were greeted by a host friendly enough, she asked us if we wanted to sit out or in, we chose in because it is to hot to sit out. she said the wait will be 20 minutes for a table. hey we walk 45 minutes so we said we will wait. not even 5 minutes goes by we got a table. now I am feeling pretty excited things are going great. we are at the table, the waiter came got our orders, he is not to friendly but he is not rude. one of those I am here because I have rent to pay attitude but we don't let it bother us. he gave us our drinks, we are excited about our food and we are waiting, 15 minutes later he comes back and said the kitchen has to close down, we have to leave, doesn't tell us why but we over heard something about a computer glitch not being able to charge customers. So we are hungry, no food, waiter comes and offer each of us a $10 gift certificate, and free drinks on a very empty stomach. okay stuff happens and we were just about to accept it until we seen two tables, that came after us getting their food and another table that refuse to get a voucher and demanding their food. so now we are upset we are never going to use those gift certificate and why the two tables that came after us  getting their food because their waiter put the order in like he was suppose to (his words by the way) and the other table there is a bunch of big black guys  and they are afraid of the.  they said, they wasn't leaving without their food. so everyone is getting their food except the 5 beautiful girls at the table. So we ask to speak to a manger he or she never showed up, after 35 minutes we decided to give the two tables our gift certificate, figured they will get better used out of (but waiter told them they can only use one per table, (wow) you couldn't pay us enough to come back. that was the only bad experience we had while in Canada, glad it happen in the end."}
{"text":"We were here for a university reunion breakfast so it was a large group. They were able to accommodate us at the back, which was nice since it is a medium sized restaurant. It sure did not feel like a chain restaurant as the décor was contemporary but cozy and in tune with the cute little restaurants and shops on the street. Perfect for a Sunday bf followed by a visit round the corner to the Tam Tams in the park on Parc Avenue. Wife enjoyed her steak and eggs and I liked the signature Eggspectation omelette. Plenty of other items on the menu including waffles, sandwiches, crepes, pancakes, etc. large lunch menu too. Would definitely visit this restaurant again when in the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"Truly a great breakfast spot! My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our food. The smoothie was flavorful and the orange juice was incredibly fresh to start. My over easy eggs were cooked perfect, I was a huge fan of their breakfast potatoes and a sides of fruit were plentiful. We left very full and happy. Prices were fair as well. Service was friendly but could of been a little more attentive."}
{"text":"I love myself some good old breakfast every so often but I love myself some good old breakfast when I am hungover especially. My first time in Montreal was a mix of epic, terrifying, fun and extra sloppy. I am dying to go back! I was fortunate enough to have gotten food from a few awesome locations Eggspectations being one of them. 

This review might be a bit lopsided because well I was just ecstatic to be alive and eating something after a night of madness. We entered and the line was overwhelming we got a name in and thus began the epic and painful wait period. Servers passed with plates of food that looked like breakfast art. I grew hungrier and finally after half an hour we were summoned. Everyone got there juice, beer and coffee on. I went with a mango blend and a shot of rum. The blend was great but the shot was some absolute fire water. The sausages! My god the sausages were good. No grit just a snappy shell and mushy meaty goodness inside. I had the mother and child to eat. Call me a horrible human being but chicken on chicken has always appealed to me. The eggs of course were awesome the chicken breast was great. It was all just great. I need to stress the breakfast here looks really pretty even the drinks seemed oddly perfect in appearance. The server was more than pleasant. For a first time bite Eggspectations did not disappoint. Would I go back? 100% yes indeed."}
{"text":"Service is shit and i found hairs in my food n the food always arrives late and the restaurant is super noisy most of the time"}
{"text":"Large portions and tasty food.  We got there on Saturday before it got crowded, were seated right away.  We had a very nice waitress that was full of smiles and quick.  The coffee was good, eggs were cooked the way I requested them.  Over all it was a very yummy breakfast to start our day of touring the city."}
{"text":"Exceptional.
I live in Chicago and was here on holiday. I might be biased as it was the only brunch spot I tried in Toronto but my friends and I had an amazing experience. Will definitely visit again and strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not one for horrible reviews, or bashing an establishment. However this breakfast place takes the cake on worst restaurant in Montreal. My bestfriend and I went on a tuesday afternoon after an appointment at the jewish general down the street. I ordered the eggs Benedict and she ordered a scrambled mexican omelette or sort. My hollandaise sauce was rotten, not just didn't taste good, but rotten and clumpy. (it takes a while for sauce like this to go bad.) When I returned my plate to the kitchen, they didn't offer an apology or even to replace it with something else. My friends meals came with brown avocado and the eggs were poorly cooked, the waitress merely took her plate and didn't ask her if she was finished or anything and left us sitting there for about 20 minutes before I could even get her attention. Finally the manager Christina came over, with bills and told us we had to pay and get out, she told us we could file a complain at head office (which you can only leave a message and no one calls you back..its been a week so far and i've left a message every day since) she was just rude and obnoxious and could give two shits that the restaurant she worked at was serving rotten food. (literally). I've worked in the industry for close to 7 seven years and my i've never been so insulted in my life, so over all food was horrid, customer service was a joke and I recommend you dont even step food in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really unimpressive. The ambiance was a little dark and gloomy for a breakfast place. Staff seemed really rushed and not as service oriented. I mean its okay for a restaurant to just provide the bare minimum service for a typical, come order, serve food timely, and give bill timely etc but I guess them being located in a better part of the city I was expecting a little too much. Anyways, I was seated, and ordered the avocado omelette which could have been the most disappointing omelette I have ever had. Period. It was too watery inside, and the sundried tomatoes were all over the palce. The avocados itself just came in chunks leaving the whole flavor meal to go south. The sides, toast and homefries that came were just depressing. t=Too greasy and just not loved enough. I also ordered a chocobanana shake which was another let down. Anyways for a bill of 50 for two wasnt a cherry on top either Price was for the location yes it was expected, but being hopeful for a great brunch and not having it was just a nil situation. Not coming back again. =("}
{"text":"This place is such a rip off it's actually so disrespectful. Ordered a smoked salmon on bagel plate, and it didn't come with cream cheese. When I asked for some cream cheese, they gave me a small packet of philadelphia cream cheese and charged me $2 for it. No, they did not let me know beforehand that they'd charge me $2 for one packet of factory made cream cheese. That happened a couple months ago, but today my friend told me that they charged her $2.50 for a side of sour cream without teling her beforehand, so it motivated me to actually write about this stuff on Yelp.

The actual food is good, although truly overpriced. I just really find this sneakily charging outrageous prices for sauces so disrespectful to its customers."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing smoothies and delicious food. I ordered the lobster egg Benny and was very happy. I liked how fresh the food was. Make sure to try their smoothies!"}
{"text":"Yum! I've always wanted to have breakfast here! We went on a Sunday morning around 9:30am. Super busy but we didn't wait for a table at all. The space does get a little bit tight as the tables are very close to each other.

We got the Montreal Benny and the Blackstone Eggs which also came with a side of potatoes and 3 slices of fruit. The food was delicious and the service was quick and friendly. 

The iced cappuccino was good, but I'd rather just get the coffee for next time.

Unfortunately one of my poached eggs was way over cooked. Other than that, a great place for a full breakfast."}
{"text":"The line can be long sometimes, but the waiting time is relatively short.

Had two brunches in summer. Recommend sitting in the terrace or downstairs with open air. The upstairs is very humid even with several big fans because of the lack of air-conditioning.
The food was good, nothing special. The portion was not too big, just fine for me. English cream was very thin, no good. Had a yogurt with nuts and grains, too plain, so I added strawberry jam in it. The waitress thought it's ketchup, and we had a laugh. 
Just an average, but good location so I will come again."}
{"text":"Went to this location again this past weekend with two friends who had never been. Awesome food as always & we had our food probably 5 minutes after ordering which was crazy fast.

One thing - their OJ is very full of pulp which I don't mind, but my friend did."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here.  The place is quite large and in a good spot.  There seems to be a more tourist crowd here, although there are many locals too.  There is a wide selection of mostly average tasting brunch items.  They do give you a lot of food though, so I think that's nice after a long night out.

The smoothies are ok, but a bit overpriced.  The buttered toast is fluffy and delicious.  Also, I know Canadians love their maple syrup, where they charge you $1 for the real stuff, nothing extra for the fake (I prefer fake, yum)."}
{"text":"Walked into this place at high volume, place was packed. Even with the high volume the staff was very friendly and helpful for anyone new to the city. The food came out incredibly fast maybe 15 minutes after ordering. Food was also very good I even said this place makes American breakfast better than in America."}
{"text":"Really good! Was vacationing last month and stopped here for brunch. Really friendly waitress and the food was great. It was my first time having poutine and I loved it! If you are in the area, check it out."}
{"text":"We ate here while staying in Montreal. Day 1 and 2. I would recommend the freshly squeezed orange juice. Also any menu item will not disappoint."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants on our trip to Montreal. Kid-friendly, delicious food, and attentive servers. We went for breakfast and were seated immediately by very friendly staff. Kids menu was pretty limited, so our kids ordered from the regular menu. My husband considers himself an Eggs Benedict aficionado and was very pleased with their offering. I had the Bagel with Lox which was nicely presented and came with a huge portion of salmon. The kids both got waffles which were delicious. The only downside: a large bill for breakfast, but we were so stuffed we were able to skip lunch! Will definitely return on our next trip!"}
{"text":"It's as good as you might eggspect from a chain breakfast restaurant - not too eggspensive, eggcellent service, eggstremely good eggs. It's cheap and cheerful, it gets the job done, it's a nice place!"}
{"text":"We originally came here for brunch on New Year 's Day and it was SUPER crowded so we left and came back the next day which was much better.  There was barely a wait for a table.  I ordered the southwest sunrise, which is a omelet with cheese onions and peppers inside and salsa, avocado and sour cream on top.  It came with potatoes and a small side of fruit.  The potatoes were good, they could stand alone but I added ketchup.  The omelet was good my only complaint was it was lacking salsa and when I asked for more of course they were trying to charge me for extra salsa, but my waitress was nice enough to sneak me some.  Looking at other people's photos of their southwest omelet I guess the cook was having a rough day because it doesn't look as nice as other people's photos who've posted on here. The service was great and the atmosphere was brightly lit and pleasant.  Overall I enjoyed coming here."}
{"text":"Fun place for breakfast or brunch.  Variety of egg based dishes done very well."}
{"text":"J'aime cet endroit principalement pour l'emplacement dans le quartier des spectacles avec une superbe terrasse en été. Menu diversifié mais quelques fois décevants on revient souvent aux mêmes choix. Peut être bruyant durant le midi la semaine"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast on a weekday morning around 9:30. The space is bright and clean, and the menu has some great sounding choices. It wasn't busy but for some reason there were no servers. Other customers in the section where I sat were looking for a server as well. After 15 minutes with no sign of staff, I left. There are lots of other good breakfast places nearby so I went to one of them where the service was present and pretty good."}
{"text":"I've eaten st Eggspectation since 1993 and love it. The decor is cute, it's  clean and the menu is fun to read. My only suggestion is add chicken sausage or turkey bacon for a lower fat option."}
{"text":"Aside from the raw rustic furniture and decor, this place definitely fell short of keeping up with it's ambiance.

Even though customer service was great and the menu had about 50 breakfast options to choose from...

We ordered what appeared to be the most tastiest items on the menu lobster Benny and lobster omelette at $18.00 each...grapefruit juice @ 4.99..

Verdict:

If there are 2 minuscule pieces of lobster on both the lobster Benny and inside the lobster omelette...the experience is going to be horrendous!!!  The bill with tax ended up being $47.00 and I left feeling robbed!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Beautiful location with a curb side view of the pedestrian plaza and MAC. Brunch was absolutely delicious. So good in fact my group and I ate here two mornings in a row. Great service from an attentive staff. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Overall this is a great centrally located breakfast and brunch spot. They do a good job on the Benedicts . The one with a waffle and bacon is my favorite."}
{"text":"So this is our first day in Montreal and the place was highly recommended by family and friends. I was amazed by the whole experience. The food taste was great. The waiter was the friendliest ever. He was so patient with our kids, giving them recommendations on what to eat and letting them have all the time they need to make up their mind. I ordered the Montreal Benedict and it was the best Benedict that I have ever had. One of my kids ordered the kids waffle and it was great as per his comments. The texture of the waffle looked great and we got bananas and strawberries as a topping. I don't know if the food tastes a lot better in Montreal Compared to Houston in general or this place is exceptional in Montreal. We decided to go there again tomorrow for breakfast."}
{"text":"Whaa? I haven't reviewed this yet? We'll third time's a charm.  


Oh geez,  I wrote that first line months ago and I still didn't manage to finish the review. Well I guess this place hasn't blown my mind enough that  I needed to hurry to write a review. 

Okay, the first few times I went here I remember it being crap. I don't love breakfast food and I didn't love this menu. I also remember the service being lacklustre. I honestly can't say any of the servers here have ever chatted with me or any other customers. They do their job but when it comes to the service sector, you often want a bit more. Don't worry, they still got healthy tips but that means I only go here when I'm desperate for a place to suggest eating breakfast. It is conveniently located downtown between two subway stops so there's that. 

And now I'm just as bored of this review as I am of this restaurant.  Sorry Yelp!, this place ain't worth writing home about or writing a fancy review about."}
{"text":"We walked around downtown for almost an hour trying to find a breakfast place. We found this place and was not disappointed. We had the Montreal Style Benedict and it was really delicious. The Smoked Salmon was also really good. The fruit cup on the side was a wonderful mix of really fresh fruit too."}
{"text":"A beautiful place to have an outdoor meal in Toronto's summer!

My son and I ate brunch at Eggspectations 7/4/16, and both the food and service were wonderful! My only disappointment is that the shading in the outdoor tables could be designed much better -- I was in the sun for about 40 minutes, or I would have been if I hadn't re-angled my chair. Other cafes figure out how to provide shade or at least some partial protection when they serve outdoors."}
{"text":"2 words. Lobster Benny. Get it. You have to. Mimosas are great. I had the Steak and Eggs. It was alright but I couldn't stop picking at my boyfriends Lobster Benny."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot. Lots of options- omelets, pancakes, waffles, etc. Went to this place for brunch both days. Good service."}
{"text":"I hate breakfast but LOVE breakfast foods at any other time of day. Especially eggs. What? There is a place that caters to my weird fetish?! Sweeeeet!! I love this place. They specialize in well....eggs! I have never seen so many different versions of eggs benedict! Smoked salmon on whole wheat toast with capers? YUM! We had to tell the waiter to come back 3 times...yes the menu is that good. I wanted the sandwiches, burgers, eggs, pancakes...it was the hardest decision of my day. However...i did not order any of those. I went with a salad.

Now before you judge me, let me just say...I am the BIGGEST salad eater. It is my fave. I have never had issues finishing a salad. Until now. I call this...Spencer vs. Tropical Chicken Salad. It started with the spinach. We arent talking bagged spinach here. This was legit spinach. Like some happy little fresh farmer just showed up with a basket he harvested as he sang french songs. The leaves were huge and fresh and covered in a vinaigrette. On top of that was a piece of chicken slathered in an orange glaze and sun flower seeds. This is when the salad kicked my butt. The top of the salad was covered in mangos, papayas and grapefruit. Did i mention it was a whole mango, 1/2 papaya and 1/2 grape fruit. I was down for the count but so happy.  See the picture. 

We also got an egg sandwich on a bagel. Egg, tomato, cheese and bacon. killer."}
{"text":"standard breakfast joint.
we showed up at noon on a sunday and it was PACKED!!! luckily they seated us pretty quickly and turnover was fast!
just like the service! it was fast! :) 
our waiter was really attentive, and the food was pretty good -
large menu to choose from
nothing extra ordinary about this place, but a decent brunch if you're in the eaton center area.
poached eggs were alright, potato home fries are good, my grilled chicken breast came out a lil dry, the hollandaise sauce is pretty yummy and rich if you go for a \"benedict\" variation.
easy, no fuss, worth a try :)"}
{"text":"The food: 2/5. The food was solid meh. I ordered their lobster eggs benedict and it was probably one of the worst I've ever had. I don't know what sauce it was, but it wasn't  hollandaise since it was very watery and unappealing. There lobster content was perhaps half a tea spoon of something pink, more reminiscent of the imitation crab meat than Nova Scotia lobster as advertised. The cappuccino was bad, so was the coffee with Baileys. The mimosas were cheap, I'll give them that. 

The service: 2/5. They were fairly busy, but not packed. Our server was inattentive and absent for long stretches of time. 

Overall: 2/5. I wouldn't eat their food again if you paid me, however you can get cheap drinks."}
{"text":"We were in town from Detroit,MI and we had high expectations for this breakfast place but it was really a disappointment. I had the lobster omelette and it was okay. I felt for $23 dollar that it would be way better. Eggs just tasted different and not fluffy. The bagel with cream cheese wasn't that good. Service was okay also. This spot has potential but need more jazz to the food. It just doesn't have that Wow factor as far as taste with it being a breakfast/brunch spot in a prime area of Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is eggcellent. If you are an egg lover this is where to go. Friendly service and cool smoothies make for an eggcellent brunch."}
{"text":"It deserves a 0 rating.
An hour wait for eggs and bacon is unacceptable. The place was busy but cmon. It wasn't packed. Service was mediocre. No manager in sight to comment about the hour wait. Waste of time and money sadly. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is always busy and filled with noise.  The atmosphere is ideal for a relaxing brunch with friends after a night with little sleep (read: bottomless coffee). I have actually been here for a work lunch as well and it was surprisingly pleasant due to the attentive and quick service. 

The food can be described as simple but wholesome. I ordered the Eggspectation Crepe the first time I was here and enjoyed the blend of savoury ham omelette with the lightly sweetened crepe. The smoothie was nothing special but got the job done. I got the Southwest Sunrise this time around and it also did not disappoint. I liked how light the flavour was and how well it blended together: the salsa, cheese, and sour cream.  If you are a big fan of fresh avocado like me this dish will satisfy. 

Besides, free Wi-Fi. That's always good.

{"text":"Given the popularity of this place, I eggspected more. Although for a busy brunch place, the service was decent. But overall, my eggsperience was just OK.

Even though it's a big restaurant, make sure you make a reservation. For last minute resos, on the day of, you can put yourself on the waitlist via Yelp and then walk over. 

Smoked Salmon Benny (3.5/5)
- I'm no eggspert on eggs benedict but of all the bennys I've tried in my lifetime, this was not quite good enough to justify a 4 

Southwest Sunrise Omelette (3/5)
- Kind of dry and needed tobasco sauce for some flavour

I wouldn't come back for brunch here again unless it's out of convenience."}
{"text":"Cute and trendy spot! Nice open outside seating area and a fun dinning experience inside.

Came here for a nice brunch on a Saturday around noon time. There was a wait that was pretty quick the hostesses said it was a 15 minute wait but we were seated in 5. The waitress was very lovely and nice. 

We ordered plain pancakes, plain French toast with a side of bacon and a bagel to share. We really wanted to try the famous Montreal bagels. It was good. 

Service was quick and food was tasty! Had an eggcellent  time. Will come again :)"}
{"text":"Yes the lobster eggs benny is a bit pricey but it is one of the best bennies I have ever had. I can't believe I waited this long to try this place! I love the atmosphere, service and food. Their coffee is one of the best I have had. Soon to be my fave breakfast places!"}
{"text":"What a great place for brunch!  The meals have a reasonable price range with good sized servings.  I enjoyed the eggsuberent meal!"}
{"text":"Their green light shake is so delicious! And the perfect cure for a night of drinking! 

I got their avocado bene. It was really fresh and delicious but a little overwhelming with the avocado fat and also the fat from egg."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great egg benedicts and good service. I recommend going if you can"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this place. The location is great, the service was okay but the food was not that good. I went for brunch with bunch of people, I had an avocado base dish, I like the idea of substituting bread for avocado, they used it as a base, added poach eggs and tomato sauce on top of it and a side of baked potatoes. The eggs were over cooked, the tomato sauce was bland and the potatoes were not good. Oh! And my ice latte came with tons of cream, why they had to ruin a perfect latte and put cream on top."}
{"text":"Visited this place for late brunch.

It was around 3PM, no wait time to get seated, only a few tables were occupied.  I've gone to this place when they used to be located in Vaughan Mills years ago.

The food quality is excellent, but do expect a longer wait time for your food arrival.  The service here, is not what I would expect, maybe it was the time I came, but our server didn't even check up on us, empty glasses of water, saw the table but ignored it and ate her own lunch instead.  We gave her eye contact but she just turned away, so we had to wave down another server to get our glasses filled.

I'd still come back here but only for the sole purpose of the food, definitely not happy about the service. Hopefully next time will be better."}
{"text":"Loved it! The avocado Benedict is a great option for gluten free or dieters. Fresh squeezed juice and lots of diff mimosas! Also, great prices."}
{"text":"The best perk about this spot was that we could sit outside and listen to music at the Montreal Jazz Festival. The menu is vast, which is nice. However, the execution of the food is just average. I ordered a savory crepe with chicken. It took them THREE times to bring the right dish, and it wasn't even a special order. The waitress seemed unconcerned and just blamed the kitchen. When it did arrive, it was basically a premade  crepe without the filling really cooked. They sell cocktails, which weren't bad (my husband tried a Bellini), but honestly not much more than an IHOP in the US."}
{"text":"Something about taking a day off from work to spend it for myself seems to be extra satisfying.  I began my day yesterday Friday morning with looking for a nice sit down breakfast place.  I was walking from Yonge and Front heading towards Elmwood spa so it had to be a place along the way.  
There were places like Eggsmart and Sunset Grill that I knew of but I wanted to find something new.
Using my Yelp App, I began my search and found Eggspectation.  Wow, this place is so hidden.  I've been working downtown for many years and never knew this place existed.  Just located behind Eaton Centre between James St and Bay St, there's an office building where the restaurant is located.

The place was very spacious.  It wasn't very busy on a Friday morning.   I wanted one of the benny dishes and got the Blackstone which my server had recommended.  It was so delicious....was it the sauce, the egg, the avocado or the bacon?...so yummy!!

The only reason for not a perfect score was that the coffee was nothing special.   But I will definitely be back to try their other menu items.  In fact, I'll be downtown soon for Nuit Blanche which I will be bringing my family here for Brunch."}
{"text":"This place was great! Busy but I was alone and fit easily at a two person table. Had the lobster Benny and it was very tasty. Finished off with a Bailey's coffee. I'm going back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I love this place!

It's my favorite place to go for breakfast dining with friends and family. I go here so often that the staff even know me and usually get a table for me when I show up!

The food selection on the menu is massive and awesome. There's so much to choose from at Eggspectations. They have various pancakes offered; omelettes; crepes; eggs benedict and so on. Also available is creton which I love so much!

On the flipside though, the restaurant doesn't have corned beef hash on their menu as a side which kinda sucks. Also, I think the coffee could be better at this place. I like drinking coffee a lot so it's kinda important for me.

Overall, I love this place. I will keep going to this place until it closes down or an act of God will stop me from going there.

FINAL SCORE: 9/10"}
{"text":"An excellent place to have brunch on the weekend. Rarely do you find a place on the weekend which has superb customer service AND great food. You can't go wrong with the menu though I would suggest sticking with the potatoes or fruit."}
{"text":"Passed by here couple times and finally got a chance to check out this place and try their breakfast. I would say their Lyonnaise-style potatoes was the only thing that surprised me cuz it's cooked with onions and herbs which added the sweetness and a richer flavour to the potatoes itself, their French toast and sausage were just average for me, nothing surprising to be honest and the omelette was a bit over cooked but the portion was enough for me as a girl cuz I was really full after finishing the whole plate, nothing left!!"}
{"text":"WOW , they exceeded all of my EGGSPECTATIONS !!  This place was such a good find in Canada , I was so pleased with their food. After walking for my hotel my friend and I were of course famished. So we looked up the reviews and this place was A1 among the tourist as well as the locals. I was afraid that the wait times would be outrageous because the reviews mention the long waits. We went it and we were seated after about 6 mins of waiting not too bad. The service was ok the first time around. I went on two separate occasions and the service was perfect the second time around. 

Now in Canada you are expected to tip , they literally look at you like you're crazy if you don't tip. The service could be horrible and they still expect a tip. 

The food is amazing honestly and truly."}
{"text":"It looks so delicious but it tasted just average. I felt like I was at a pickle barrel all you can eat breakfast place. I was expecting it to be a lot more flavourful considering it is a brunch breakfast place. I did like their bravocado entree though. Either way not a 5*"}
{"text":"I would drive back to Toronto just to repeat this meal again.  I went with four friends and every bite was better than the last.  I think the major hit was the French Toast Flambe.  Make it a point to stop here (and get mimosas) if you're ever in town!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast I've ever had. The omelet was cooked nicely, with a light serving of fruits and sliced potatoes. I went back the next day with a couple more friends and ordered their classic Eggs Benedict. It was my first time eating it, and I can definitely say my body probably hates me for putting so much goodness and butter into my bloodstream. The eggs were lovely, with a gentle stream of yolk oozing? out onto the plate. I was greatly satisfied, so satisfied I skipped dinner. I would really recommend this place to anyone who comes to Montreal."}
{"text":"LOVE this place and their egg puns!  Food was incredibly delicious, the service was incredibly friendly, and the puns are incredibly funny.  The restaurant was trendy and cozy at the same time - how do they do that?"}
{"text":"Words that describe this restaurant: Astonishing, Eggselence, Delightful, Quality and On point! I've had all types of eggs, but these were so so good. Something about them tasted differently, but in a good way. First of the name is clever and its attractive. Also their slogan \"Grab the days by the egg\". Nice word play! As I was thinking all they had was eggs. To my surprise the inside reminded me of and old building with the brick walls. Classic looking seats added an additional touch to the place. Now to the stuff you came here for.

Let's start off with the cappuccino, man did it satisfy my coffee craving, bold and good to the last drop. They're proud of their drop coffee as custom-roasting. They use high quality Arabica beans. According what I was I told that the coffee is roasted in Italy and prepared using a traditional Italian artisanal recipe. Which is we the coffee is superbly so good. 

At our table we had the following and were sharing some:

Best way to Kick-start your day with a some stacks of pancakes that come layered in between with sausages, bacon and potatoes and top with a sunny side egg. Sound like a lot but the bit I had was full of flavor and even though it looked like a dish that will fill you all up day, it really was moist, soft and filling. But you'll be good for lunch or dinner after having this. The fruit was a good touch too.

Another surprising dish was the Yolk Around The Clock. This is sliced bagel grilled with a sunny-side-up egg in each hole, topped with bacon and cheddar on one half and Swiss cheese on the other, with their famous seasoned Lyonnaise-style potatoes on the side. This looked so good that I had it the next day for my breakfast. Clever way to make a breakfast sammich (sandwich). 

On my first trip there I had the heavenly All American, I asked for my two eggs to be over easy. This came with the perfectly seasoned Lyonnaise-style potatoes, bacon, sausages, ham, baked beans and white toast (you can choose multigrain if you prefer). The potatoes were crispy and seasoned to perfection until the last bite. Bacon, sausages and ham were all on point not too salty as some other restaurants, just perfect. The baked beans was a surprisingly good touch and cooked perfectly. The fruit took it over the top. 

My friend had the Southwest Sunrise and damn did that plate look so good. Which he did enjoy. Imagine an omelette filled with cheddar, Swiss 
and Gruyère cheeses, sautéed peppers, then 
topped with strips of freshly sliced avocado, 
our special salsa and sour cream. Served with 
our Lyonnaise-style potatoes. Let's just say that the plate was clean when he was done.

I couldn't leave without trying the waffles (not knowing if we were coming back for seconds the next day) . The classic waffle which is a traditional Belgian waffle, served hot off the griddle with pure Canadian maple syrup. This was buttery, crispy and the syrup just took it over the top. Such a perfect breakfast!

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a wonderful breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"The menu is big and there are a lot of options. Be prepared to wonder if you can get a sampler platter of some sort so you can try a little of everything. 

This isn't a big place so be prepared to wait, especially if you go during peak times. Luckily, we went on a Friday morning so we didn't have to wait, but it was still pretty busy. The menu is diner style food which is perfect because I just wanted something simple. I ordered the Smoked Meat omelette and it was a perfect choice. There was plenty of large pieces of smoked meat in the omelette and it was accompanied by their Lyonnaise potatoes and toast. The potatoes were out of this world! They had this crispiness that was quite as crunchy as a french fry, but they weren't soft and mushy either. My bf ordered a Benedict and a Caesar and the Caesar was really good. I was jealous that I didn't order one.

 They didn't have any menus in English when we arrived, but, luckily Google Translate saved the day. The hostess spoke broken English but she was nice enough. We sat at the bar and the bartender wasn't very friendly. I understand she was the primary person to make drinks and such, so we weren't expecting her to hang around and chat it up with us. However, it would have been nice for the few interactions we had with her to be decent."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me and I like almost every brunch place. Eggspectation has met my expectation. Not overly great, but a decent brunch place. 

A huge selection of eggs (really?) menu. What to eat here? Typical brunch place - sausages, eggs, fruits etc. I can't have enough bacons. 

My complaint is the waiting time if you're a group of three or more. Come here on a Saturday at 11am.... you'll be seated at 1130. Location is great at the heart of downtown Toronto. Eat before you shop at the Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"Great food, nice location and excellent service. 

Right next to eaton centre

Parking will be a problem but there are public parking spots available."}
{"text":"Got the 'extravaganza' - 2 eggs, 2 French toast, ham and skip the potatoes.  Asked for grilled tomatoes and fruit - watermelon, cantaloupe, orange.   Ham and eggs were fine - nothing to write home about - three thin slices of ham.  French toast was good, little soft (undercooked?) in the middle.  It's August - prime fresh fruit and vegetable time.  The tomato and cantaloupe had no flavor and were as firm as the box they were shipped in.  For $24 (tip and coffee) you would think the main course would be hardy, and fruit and veggies would be fresh, at least this time of the year."}
{"text":"This place is very close to the heart of Toronto and has a very open and chill vibe. We got an omelette along with their French toast and both did not disappoint. The best part is that everything is fresh and you can taste the high quality ingredients. Service is fast, food was great, and price was fair."}
{"text":"Walking distance from our hotel, Marriott Chateau. Staff were very pleasant. Service was fast, yet they don't rush you to leave like most brunch places in NYC. Quality of food is superb! Tho prices are comparable to Manhattan."}
{"text":"It's ok but I think overall there are plenty of better breakfast places in Montreal.  Their pancakes are on the dry side but their potatoes are really good.  Usually getting one of the eggs-based dishes is your best bet."}
{"text":"great service
great food, like all breakfast joints it's more pricey than expected (usually around 15-25$ per person) but the food is amazing
the lobster or chicken bennys are both to die for
amazing atmosphere and very close to guy concordia (peel?) metro so accessible for most
very cheerful place and nice homey feel
eggs are healthy
delicious"}
{"text":"Food was ok, I've had (and made) better scrambled eggs, with broccoli and cheddar. But it wasn't awful. We went twice since my friend liked the place. 
It's a bit pricey, out of all the meal we've had the two at this place were the most expensive, although we did eat a lot and the fresh squeezed orange juice had an impact on that for sure.

If you go the waffles are really good, even though my friend didn't like it so much, I thought it was the best thing (that we've tried) there.
The first batch came COLD, but she let the waitress know and they got her some fresh warm ones, so props for that! 

The first time the waitress had high \"eggspectations\" about her tip. Sorry to disappoint but yeah, tips are optional and SHOULD NEVER be expected, I think this is rude and has affected my view of the restaurant as a result.

{"text":"Great spot for tourists to grab brunch before heading out to start your day with some site seeings!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan.  I got the eggstravaganza (i think that's what it was called) which included 2 eggs, potatoes, 2 pancakes, and sausages. Eggs were pretty standard, pancakes were fluffy, and the sausages were delicious (they give you 3 of them). The maple syrup is the real deal, but they only give you a mini-bowl of it (instead of the full bottle).

Service was slow but that's to be expected on a Sunday of Caribana weekend in a breakfast place. Otherwise they were attentive and our order was correct."}
{"text":"Awesome import from MONTRÉAL with a great patio with good vibe inside. Benny's  and menu are  great with authentic savoury crepes. Luba is a fantastic server who will make your visit well worth it! A feast place to hang out!"}
{"text":"I came here for a brunch with a group of 10 people. It is a large restaurant with two floors and unfortunately A LOT of noise. My experience there was average. The waiter was nice and I only saw her twice, when she took the orders and when she and a co-worker brought the food. I had the waffle with fruit and was underwhelmed. The fruit may not have been fresh and was probably sitting in some type of liquid because my waffle came out soggy. The price was standard for mtl brunch but possibly a bit more expensive than usual (around 20$ with tax and tip). The restaurant is in a good location to access with public transport but you will have trouble finding parking if you drive because it is right downtown. The food came out quick and most people I was with enjoyed their meals. There is nothing special about the food here but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! It was everything that we wanted. The staff was awesome and the food was even better. We were totally stuffed leaving this place!"}
{"text":"Even though the service here wasn't rude I'm still going to give Eggspectation 1 star since my friend got wretched sick from food poisoning here and it was a complete waste of time and money.

My friend wanted to go to Eggspectation, since she and her husband had such a great experience at a different  location around NYE. We were seated quickly and from there the service slowed down a snail's pace. We waited a looooong time to have our orders taken. Our server wasn't intentionally rude but she was clearly overwhelmed and inefficient. We had a birds'-eye view of the kitchen and we could see our orders drying out on the shelves in the kitchen as we waited a ridiculous amount of time for our food. My friend was starving and ended up eating one of the little packets of peanut butter sitting on the jelly caddy. 

I got the American, and it was evident that I should have ordered Canadian bacon as my meat because they did NOT know American bacon. The bacon was nasty, it looked like that precooked bacon that buy at the grocery store and reheat in the microwave. Our server initially brought me a wrong order and had to replace it with my correct order. The scrambled eggs were dried out, however the Lyonnaise potatoes were tasty. The pancake I got as a side for $4.50 CAD was a joke, I hated it, it was cold and rubbery and dry. 

My friend ordered the French toast side and come on we were around French Canadians, the French toast shouldn't have looked so nasty! She also had the Salmon Benedict...and was deathly sick right after eating it and for the rest of the day. Not awesome. 

It. Took. FOREVER AND A DAY to finally get our check and then another day to get to pay out. DO NOT waste your precious tourist dollars and limited time at this nasty place. Too many other food options to go to."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal with my husband for a weekend and we had brunch at eggspectation on our second day there. It was delicious and the service was fast and friendly. The breakfast poutine redeemed my appreciation of poutine after a disappointing experience at a cafe in the ghetto part of town which name I won't mention.  I had the eggstravaganza which had very generous portions and the lyonnaise style potatoes are great. I also had a green juice which was a mix of spinach, green apple, and mint and it was so good!! I am going back there next time for sure"}
{"text":"I felt that the portions here were too small for the price point and the food wasn't seasoned very well. Potatoes were really plain. If an establishment is going to charge this much for eggs benedict, your hollandaise sauce straight up needs to taste better. Really disappointed considering how long we waited to eat here."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch on a Tuesday, it's a very convenient spot to have lunch at after shopping at Eatons as it's just in the building across from the exit next to Indigo. It's also a very spacious restaurant with a lot of seating, we arrived at around 11am and only a few people were having lunch.

The menu is freaking huge - they have steak, burgers, omelettes, waffles, crepes, pasta, Benedict's, french toast, salads, and so on. It definitely gave me and my friend a bit of decision paralysis. I will definitely need to come back and try the other things as the Chicken Benedict's I had was delicious and to my surprise, it was served with fruit (this isn't mentioned on the menu).

Service was exceptional, our waiter was quick to greet and provide us with water along with taking our orders. He checked up on us several times throughout the meal as well."}
{"text":"Oh man, their eggs benedict was just amazing. I have to say that their hollandaise sauce was spot on. Just enough tang and flavour and with the egg cooked perfectly, every bite was mouth-watering. Now when I eat, I always need to have that perfect bite, but I save the best for last. A bit of egg yolk, egg white, spinach, sauce, guacamole, and english muffin. Sigh, it's an orgy of flavours in your mouth. I was really suprised that this was one of the best eggs benedict that I've tried because when I first came here I was in doubt since it was a franchise, but HELLZ NO. I was wrong. My friend had an omelette, but fuck that. I mean, it was good, but eggs benedict is where my calling's at. My friend was jealous when she saw my meal, and when she saw that angelic last bite, her eyes screamed \"Bitch, I hate you.''"}
{"text":"Cannot understand the 5 star ratings. This place is okay, one star below the old Eggspectation in my opinion.

We ordered one of the burgers that claimed to be with \"caramelized onions\". Look at the picture. The burger was very messy and the surprising free addition of a fried egg on top came on the side and not on top as stated. My Smoked Salmon eggs benny was tiny and not as advertised. The toast was so soggy by the time it got to me and the layer of cream cheese was thin and added but nothing to the plate. The fresh fruit was good, actually a decent serving.

The patio was great until the kitchen exhaust came on. Damn that thing is loud and aimed directly at the patio.

Service was good. Not the best but not the worst. This is a good middle of the road breakfast place."}
{"text":"Very modern looking and \"eggcellent\" food and service. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and the food was very filling and tasty. I especially liked leaving the restaurant not overly full."}
{"text":"It was quite hard to find this restaurant, due to the fact that it wasn't actually on Bay Street. I just happened to turn into Bell Trinity Square walking towards what happened to be the Eaton Centre and saw Eggspectation sitting just on my right. We came a little after they opened and were greeted and seated right away. 

The restaurant looked asthetically appealing to the eye, with it's very vintage but modern look. The brown tables and white chairs gave a very modern appeal and brightened up the restaurant very well. My boyfriend ordered the BBQ Burger which was messy just as the waiter told us. My boyfriend loved his burger, as it also had onion rings in it as well which gave it a nice kick. As for myself, I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine which was amazing. The hollandaise sauce was very flavourful and savoury along with the yolk in my poached egg. My meal came with home fries which were very-like potato wedges, but tasted much different. They were seasoned very well and taste amazing. Prior to our meals we also ordered an appetizer of onion rings which I will recommend if you ever decide to eat here. The onion ring is fried to perfection and is very crispy and not too overly salty. The sauce that it comes with (I don't remember what it is) goes very well with the onion rings. 

Overall would recommend this place if you want a nice savoury lunch!"}
{"text":"Pros: fresh squeezed orange juice, perfectly poached eggs
Cons: the service was mediocre and the food lacked flavor"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced.  They seemed overwhelmed at times when it came for food delivery to table.  Overall good food and service but definitely watch your wallet especially  with all these extra taxes"}
{"text":"Such a cute place, very aesthetically pleasing. Myself and my best friend ordered the \"Yolk around the Clock\" and it was amazing! Such a unique dish (at least to my tastebuds) and the staff were excellent and charismatic as well! I also had a bite of my aunt's French toast and it's extremely yummy and fluffy."}
{"text":"A restaurant all about eggs led me to think that it would only be breakfast-y foods... but don't be fooled by the name, they have plenty of other things to offer! This location was a short walk from my hotel and my sister and I decided to have lunch here before our long drive to Quebec. It was a rather large restaurant but it was filled nearly to capacity when we got there around noon... luckily we were seated right away and I was immediately overwhelmed with the menu. Not because it was Bible thick, but rather, the variety of their offerings ranging from a huge breakfast menu to crepes and sandwiches really put me in a tailspin as to what I should have.

I ended up with a California chicken sandwich w/ their house Lyonaise potatoes. My sister ordered a burger and sweet potato fries. Everything was DE-LISH!! Ingredients tasted fresh and of high quality. I really wish they had Eggspectations here in the U.S.!!! I would be there every weekend for brunch..."}
{"text":"Une belle place pour aller bruncher à Montréal, les plats sont bons et les prix sont raisonnables! Je lui enlève une étoile, puisque pour ma part, les crêpes était un peu sec. Cependant il y avait beaucoup de beaux fruits et la crème anglaise était bonne. Leurs smoothies sont à essayer !! Le service était ok."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast near Côte Des Neiges.

You can also get lunch. They focused on eggs dishes."}
{"text":"Too many egg options!  I guess that's what is eggspected from a place called eggspectations (sorry, I had to).

Seating was very quick, service was good, food was meh and prices are ok.  I've been here multiple times and have had a consistent experience.  Its convenient to get to for anybody taking public transportation being right at the Eaton Centre.  It does get busy but I have found that they still are able to seat you relatively quickly.  Not my favourite spot to go for breakfast but an easy one to meet up with friends for."}
{"text":"Eggs, eggs, eggs and more! When we entered, the place was bustling but we were promptly seated. I ordered the eggs Benedict Florentine which came out picture perfect with lyonnaise potatoes, and a slice of watermelon and cantaloupe. I'm not gonna lie though, for an eggcentric place I was expecting perfectly made eggs but my poached eggs were still a little underdone since there was still quite a lot of runny egg whites running around. There was also waaay more hollandaise than I preferred, which has a tangy mayonnaise-y taste to it. Not bad though. The spinach underneath was done well and the English muffin was surprisingly not soggy considering the amount of sauce on top. The potatoes were nice and fluffy and the watermelon was a refreshing bite after all that thick hollandaise sauce action. My partner got the high rise pancake which looked pretty amazing! A stack of pancakes with sausage, bacon, and potatoes between each layer. The pancakes were nice and fluffy and everything covered in the maple syrup was just perfect. Once again though, the sunny side egg on top had a strange film on top of the yolk, and the white was a bit burnt. The imperfect eggs aren't a deal breaker, just not what you'd expect from a place dedicated to eggs :p overall a decent brunch place though"}
{"text":"I'm not sure who goes to Eggspectation on a regular basis, but I would have to question their taste level. It was seemingly jam packed with tourists and ryerson students, with wait-times upwards of an hour. Are these people crazy? Brunch, to me, is a nice lulling into the day, coffee and a cozy restaurant. This is the antithesis of cozy.  A veritable factory of breakfast that easily could pass for my university dining hall fare. I had french toast and eggs. The eggs were barely present on my plate, and the french toast was irregularly smeared with a sweet, marmalade like substance. As a lover of savoury french toast only, I was grossed out and annoyed that this wasn't mentioned on the menu. My friend was given a mug of hot water with a floating potato in it for her tea. She returned it and the server did not even apologize. I will never set foot in this 'restaurant' again."}
{"text":"Sat down & the service well to say it politely was slow !!   We waited & then got to order one drink and they brought one drink problem was there was three of us sitting there   ...  Food was really good , menu was nice based around the egg but the service was not good at all then felt like he couldn't figure out the dollars from us to Canadian do not like to be lied to lucky to get a tip LUCKY !!!!!!    If they fix the service place was good !!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast with the wife and 2 kids. I ordered the veggie omelette, the wife ordered 2 scrambled eggs with sausage and the kids ordered bagel with cream cheese. The toast was excellent. My omelette was good, though not \"eggceptional\". I might have ordered the wrong item on their menu. I should have gone with their Benedict dishes. The service was awesome, and is worth going back for. Will order the right dish next time."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast! Ended up here twice in one week since it was close to a conference I was attending and had lots of variety and options.

The service was great. Attentive, quick, and the food came out fast even though the restaurant was quite busy on a weekday afternoon. 

The first time I ate here I got a lox benny, but substituted a bagel for the toast. The bagel was Montreal style and delicious. The lox was tasty as well. On my second trip, I opted for the Montrealer -- smoked meat, eggs any style, and toast. It came with a huge heaping portion of fruit. I also had a green smoothie - it was perfectly made. 

Eggspectation isn't anything special, but it is a solid breakfast option with lots of choices (including healthy ones) and snappy service."}
{"text":"Go here for eggs and don't try anything else. I'm a vegan who made the mistake of ordering a salad (hold the egg and tuna) and it was so ick I couldn't eat it. Waitress didn't offer to take if off the bill. Should have ordered a plain bagel. My husband enjoyed his Eggs Benedict on a bagel. Fresh grapefruit juice was good. Wait staff was nice. Place has a happy, busy vibe."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Montreal, while caffeinating at Starbucks, we inquired about a recommendation in the area for breakfast and our barista pointed us just down the block to Eggspectation.  This location is in the Old Montreal area, which, as tourists we clearly spent a good deal of time exploring, and, while I found it lacked the charm of many of the other smaller eateries nearby, it was convenient to our hotel, reasonably priced, and easily accommodated our traveling party of six two mornings in a row.

According to their menu, Eggspectation is apparently acclaimed for their many Benedict-style egg dishes.  It's nice when a restaurant lives up to their own hype, because the Russian rhapsody was probably the best Benedict-style dish I've ever had.  I say Benedict-style because it was not plain old hollandaise on there, but something they called Romanoff sauce.  Whatever it was, it was delicious and I had a hard time straying from this to try something new the next morning.  On our second visit I tried the breakfast burger, which was basically a meat omelette slapped on a brioche with lettuce and tomato.  Not as magical as the rhapsody dish, but certainly a big step up from a breakfast sandwich at Dunkin Donuts.  The most indulgent part of our meal here was the breakfast appetizer of s'mores French toast.  Everybody wanted to try it, but nobody thought ordering an entire plate of that for breakfast was such a wise idea, so we got a communal one and everyone got to have a taste.  We are still talking about it weeks later.      

A quick google search tells me that Eggspectation is a chain and that there are a few locations in the US, though none local to me.  I hope they make it to Massachusetts at some point, because IHOP just doesn't cut it compared to this place.  I will say that If you're a traveler who really relishes an authentic experience for every meal in a new city, maybe you want to skip this place as it is, as I said, a chain, but this place really delivered for us."}
{"text":"They make every egg style imaginable here! They also have plenty of breakfast options other than eggs! Highly recommend if you'd like a yummy breakfast spot with a fun vibe."}
{"text":"Loved it all the way from Toronto...food was amazing but the noise wasn't pleasant .. I'd reccomend getting the all American"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a terrific breakfast in my favorite city, check out Eggspectation, located near old city hall . The menu is vast and the service was stellar. You don't even have to like eggs to have a good meal. We dined outside and left nothing on our plates. I liked that my order of two fried eggs came with fresh fruit. Choose from eggs (surprise!) about 50 different ways (omelets, Eggs Benedict with twists, on a  Montreal bagel, French toast, waffles, wraps, a breakfast burger, crepes...there are even sandwiches and non-egg entrees. And dessert). My only regret is not ordering a Montreal bagel. Breakfast for three without alcohol totaled about $60 before tip. Great way to begin the day."}
{"text":"The food there is alright if you reallt like eggs and don't mind paying for food you can make in your own kitchen just as quickly. The service is pretty efficient which is a plus but the the fancy names for the food don't hide their boringness. If you don't mind dishing out a bit more money, La Societe is across the street and over more unique choices or head to St. Laurent for more brunch options!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant while in Toronto; I chose this place for breakfast based on the reviews and we were not disappointed!  The Pickled Caesar drink and Lobster Omelet were delicious and I appreciated changing up my usual breakfast order!  My boyfriend had an Irish Coffee and Montrealean Omelet which were also great.  We will definitely be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"6/26/15: Decent breakfast / brunch with fresh and high quality ingredients.

1. Freshly Squeezed Grapefruit Juice Regular C$4.50:  Pretty good freshly squeezed grapefruit juice.  Very  fresh tasting.  Don't always see this, even at breakfast specialty places, so this was a nice surprise.  7/10

2. Coffee C$2.45:  Sorry, don't remember how it tasted.

3. Lobster Omelette C$18.95:  Pretty hard to find lobster in here, otherwise the price would have been quite nice for lobster.  Potatoes were a little plain.  Kinda disappointed with this one.  I did appreciate the generous lathering of hollandaise sauce though.  4/10.

4. Eggspectation Bagel Breakfast Sandwich C$10.95:  Probably a bit over-priced for what it is, but the bagel is fresh and flavorful, and the various vegetables were very fresh and vibrant in colors.  Each bite was like biting into freshly pulled vegetables and fresh bread.  Love these Canadian bagels which are chewier and denser than those I'm used to in America.  A basic breakfast sandwich well executed.  7.5/10

I wouldn't mind coming back.  Everything is very fresh and good quality.  A little pricey for what you get though.

3/5

{"text":"Omg lobster Benny and lobster omelette!!!! MUST MUST MUST TRY !!! Hands down the best breakfast spot I have ever eaten at! During my visit to toronto, I was in the mood to have some chocolate pancakes. I do not usually go out for breakfast foods because I feel like they taste so simple that you can make it on your own. I have tried a lot of popular places in San Francisco Bay Area (where I'm from) that my friends rave about but they still taste basic to me. Since I was out of town, I had no choice but to go out to get my pancakes. It was that morning that I fell in love with eggspectation.The food and customer service got my boyfriend and I to come back a second time on our 5 day stay! We even ordered the same exact thing. If I'm ever visiting toronto again, the first thing I'm gonna do is get me some breakfast at eggspectation!"}
{"text":"Terrific breakfast! During annual Girls Weekend, finding the perfect breakfast spot is an absolute must. This was it! So good had to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a day where I wasn't feeling well, and just wanted poached eggs and sliced tomato for lunch.  The atmosphere is  just ok, and sort of dreary actually.  The outdoor seating option would have been better, but it had rained earlier.  

The menu is quite extensive, and perhaps my experience would have been better with a truer breakfast order than just poached eggs, but the waitress said they do poached eggs very well.  Hey, just what I wanted to hear!

Darn it...  the poached eggs were just ok.  A bit too watery and not drained well, so when I broke the yolk, it got sort of soupy when mixed with the water.  It was still decent, but definitely have had better.  The tomato was good.  

Service was neutral.  The location is on the corner of the street, and it's a convenient downtown stop for food (they offer lunch, as well) - pricing is actually quite low - which is nice.  It is a Canadian chain, if that makes any difference to you.  I got to try local chains and individual breakfast spots, and you really don't lose on anything food-related in this great city. :)  But if you want the best poached eggs ever, I so suggest Le Cartet!  Can't beat it!   

The restrooms are upstairs, at the far end of the restaurant.  With an inflamed joint in my foot from having hiked up to Mont Royal with ballet flats (yup, stupid), it was a bit of a battle to get there.  Maybe they had an elevator, but I'm not certain."}
{"text":"Nice place...good ambience...bit loud and noisy as its mostly packed but doesn't matter if you there's a delicious yummy meal waiting to give your taste buds out of the world experience...Checked in for the first time and ordered southwest omelette, mac n cheese pasta and french toast... though little expensive but all of them were worth the price. Highly recommended to try plethora of egg based delicacies. Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"I know this place is a chain, but we don't have anywhere I'm from and so I wanted to try this place out.

They definitely have a lot of these in Montreal so you're bound to find one near you wherever you're staying. It was my first morning in Montreal and of course, I checked yelp to see where to have breakfast. I saw this place and despite the yelp rating decided to check it out.

We actually came to this location when I had meant to go to another one but all is good and so as I previously said you're bound to find a location near you.

This place must be pretty popular because when we went there were many people waiting, but luckily since we were only a party of two, we were seated right away.

The menu is overwhelming, there are so many options from breakfast to lunch/dinner options. I ended up going with the breakfast burger and my boyfriend got the American breakfast (eyeroll). It was so good the only thing I didn't like was the drink I ordered which was some banana java which tasted like straight up espresso when I thought it would have more chocolate flavor. Oh well.

So good, my boyfriend wanted to come back but as it was our first time in Montreal I wanted to try as many new places as possible so we didn't come back during the trip.

Next time I will definitely make a stop here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were headed somewhere else for lunch when we passed by a sign that showed a pic if a BBQ burger. We quickly changed our plans and went in to the restaurant. This was our first time eating at Eggspectation and we were not disappointed. I had the BBQ burger without the onion rings which the waitress brought me on the side just in case I changed my mind. Hubby loves onion rings so that worked out well. He had the bad boy burger. We both had their fries he with gravy, me with their mayo sauce. The food was wonderful and hubby's gravy was very different tasting, had a strong hint if cinnamon. It turned me off but he loved it. I loved the mayo sauce. Our waitress was very nice. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a solid place to eat. My only regret is we didn't find it sooner in our trip so that we could try out some of their breakfast selections."}
{"text":"I am not huge on breakfast foods, I don't like bacon (gasp) nor sausage or other kinds of typical breakfast meats. I'm not huge on carbing it up so early on mounds of pancakes, and I despise eggs. I know what you are thinking \"so Sara, if you despise eggs, why would you dine at a restaurant called EGGspectation?\"
The answer is simple, I don't live round these here parts and the nice girl at the desk of my hotel recommended the place. 

Coming in on a Saturday morning around 11, my friend and I were seated right away and a waitress greeted us promptly; the 2 story restaurant buzzing and the tables full of happy diners. Skipping past the huge list of available egg selections, I settled on [calorie packed] french toast.. hey I'm on vacation right? 3 slices served with maple syrup and fresh fruit, yumm yumm. My friend ordered the southwest omelet which was served with a basket of toast, potatoes and fresh fruit.   

The service here was probably the best I received during my entire trip in Montreal. It was maybe 10 minutes from the time we ordered to the time food was set in front of us and our waitress came back a few times for coffee refills and to ask if we needed anything. 

One out of one Saras agree that Eggspectaions is eggcelent."}
{"text":"I ordered the pancakes pagé and the pancakes were reallyy good especially with that prime maple syrup. However, I didn't like the fruits that came with it, I feel like they weren't the best quality although the crème anglaise made them taste better. But overall it was pretty good"}
{"text":"So good! Decided to go with a sweeter breakfast today. Steve our waiter was absolutely nice and great! Food was delicious. Can't wait to come back and try their eggs to see if they actually meet my eggspectations"}
{"text":"Came in for brunch with a friend of mine, both our first times. From the outside of the restaurant you couldn't have known how nice and classy inside is until you go in and check them out. I ordered lobster benny and my friend ordered smoked salmon benny. The plate looked full and beautiful, with generous amounts of fresh and perfectly cooked lobster, potatoes and fruits. The taste was even better than I could have expected, and I came here with very high \"eggspectations\" pun intended. The freshly squeezed orange juice was true to word and was the perfect combination of tangy and sweet. Would definitely come back again! Oh and PS the service was just as amazing."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but not worth the 40 minutes it took to come out once we placed our order. They're eggs, FFS. Overall it was pretty meh, but the price was fine and the food was fine, so.. three stars."}
{"text":"I remember this place used to be good 20 years ago. I would give it two stars but the service was good, the location is great, the patio and inside of the restaurant is nice so one extra star for ambience and location!

For breakfast, meat options are all pork except for smoked meat. And the smoked meat was pretty horrible. It was fatty, tough and unappetizing. It's just an overpriced place with mediocre food. 

The freshly squeezed orange juice or grapefruit juice is excellent. I wish it was bigger."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The service was even better. 

I had the Eggspectation Omelette with a side of French toast. Everything was absolutely delicious. The Lyonnaise style potatoes are a must."}
{"text":"Nothing special and overpriced for no reason. You can get better quality food and service at many other places in downtown.
They don't even have wifi. Not going there again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very quick! Customer service was not the best though... The bread basket never came and when we asked for it, the server looked at us like we had 10 heads... Good food and a great price so will be back :)"}
{"text":"A good place for brunch in downtown. I ordered egg Benedict. It tasted good. Also, the dishes there look healthy and not very fatty. The environment is nice too. In summer time, you can site outside. The service is just ok."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch after school. I ordered a burger and it was good. The server was nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this place for brunch on a weekend. I absolutely love this place. The menu is quite extensive and you can order anything in terms of breakfast (pancakes, eggs, waffles, fruits, etc.). They also have a lunch menu which we have not ordered from so I wouldn't know much about that. But the breakfast/brunch menu is great. 

The portions are really generous. The staff are courteous and friendly. The service all in all is good. Highly recommend this place for an amazing breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Ayant séjourné à Montréal une demi année, j'ai eu la chance d'essayer plusieurs restaurants proposant des brunchs. Tellement rares et \"classiques\" en France, j'ai été comblée à Montréal, en particulier grâce à eggspectation !
Bien que ce soit une chaîne de restaurant - brunch, le concept est très séduisant (et unique !).

Petit jeu de mots, mais qui défini bien le concept, ici, tout est à base d'oeufs. Il faut donc aimer ! Le menu propose un (trop?) vaste choix, les quantités sont plus qu'importantes (on ne sortira pas affamé d'ici) et la présentation est vraiment top.

Et comme beaucoup de brunchs au Québec, votre assiette sera garnie de fruits et de patates... Miam !

Petit bémol, le restaurant est plutôt grand, donc le service est parfois un peu lent..."}
{"text":"Well, it's not what I eggspected.  For a place that focuses on eggs, I thought our eggs would have been done properly.  We ordered 2 different omelettes and a dish with 2 eggs over easy.  The grill must have been too hot because all our eggs were over cooked. Service was pretty good, but we were all a bit surprised that their main dish wasn't properly prepared.
For what they charge, we were highly disappointed."}
{"text":"--- Food ---
First time eating at Eggspectation. It's located right beside Eaton Centre Mall - convenient location. I ordered the Smoked Egg Benny ~$14. 

The benny didn't come with the traditional english muffin but brown toast; that's a neat change but I think I prefer english muffins instead. The hollandaise sauce was alright. The smoke salmon tasted quite fresh; I especially liked how it wasn't too salty (like other ones I've tried before). The meal also came with an assortment of fresh fruits - tasty. 

I don't think the dish was anything unique or special. I've had better salmon benny elsewhere.

--- Atmosphere ---
My friend and I sat outside on the patio. We arrived around noon, and the restaurant seemed pretty empty on the inside. Lots of space to sit, I did make a reservation anyways though. 

It was nice that they regularly came around our table to refill our water or coffee drinks. Our server/waiter on the other hand... provided minimal customer service. He doesn't smile, abrupt, it felt like he didn't enjoy his job and just wanted us to order, eat, pay, and leave. 

--- Summary --- 
The egg benny is mediocore. I will likely try their other dishes if I come here again."}
{"text":"I go to Montreal a lot and always go to a diner type place for breakfast on St Catherine. But I couldn't find that place this time. Glad that I got wifi at my hotel, went on to Yelp and found this place nearby. It was going to be my first meal of 2015 so it must be good. 

The pictures and reviews sold me. I was worried that this place was going to be deep in the mall, I wanted a restaurant with views of the outside since it was snowing outside. Found the place in the corner of the block of the mall, across from the arts museum. Didn't wait long to be seated. I was worried about a rush of people wanting food the morning after New Years. This place has two levels. 

They have a great menu. I've never seen so many kinds of eggs benadict on a menu. I wanted some carbs and protein and Eggstravaganza had everything I wanted. Eggs, pancakes, sausage, and a side of fruit! Got to love going to Montreal. They want you to be healthy. The amount of food is just the right amount. Most of the time I would have way too much food for breakfast back home in america. The coffee is great too. Service was nice as well. I give this place my 'BANGIN' review! Forget that old place I used to go. I will go here when I come back to Montreal!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the more popular breakfast chains in Montreal. The restaurants are basically located throughout the city (in the most convenient) places, which is nice. 

The menu is probably one of the best things about this restaurant. There is a huge variety and, from what I've heard, the food always seems to be up to par. There are also several vegetarian options. In terms of vegan options, there isn't too much, but there are definitely items on the menu that are satisfying (fruit, potatoes) as long as you're not looking for a meal that is super creative. The prices are also very reasonable, especially because the portions are always big. You 100% get what you pay for.

My only issue with this establishment is that the service is inconsistent, although certain locations (e.g. rue Sainte-Catherine) are much more consistent than others. The service tends to be all over the place for the most part. If you're picky about service, I would recommend the Sainte-Catherine location because it's always great! Finally, if you're planning on eating here for breakfast/ brunch on a weekend, be prepared to wait! It gets super busy unless you go early.

All in all, a great breakfast place that's not too expensive and has good food!"}
{"text":"Good food. Montreal burger is nothing to brag about. Drinks are pretty good. Nice spot to hang out..Great service by the waitress!!"}
{"text":"This gem of a restaurant so exceeded my expectations that I visited twice for brunch during a 4-day stay in Toronto.  The dining room is very large and very bright, with a contemporary industrial but warm and homey feel.  The space has high ceilings from which fishbowl-type chandeliers hang and exposed pipes.  Seating is at either wood tables or in cozy booths, and accommodated groups as small as 2 and as large as 12.  Several large screen televisions hang from the walls broadcasting (American) football, soccer, and professional poker .  

The staff is exceptionally friendly, from the manager who greeted us and put us on the list for seating (a 20 minute wait that turned into less than 10), to our server who answered all of our menu questions and chatted us up past the 3pm closing time.  They even gave out free mimosas on account of New Year's Day.  The restaurant menu was more like a professionally published hardcover picture book  than your typical menu.  It offered everything from  pancake and eggs platters to an array of french toasts, to variations of eggs benedict, to burgers and Italian fare.The kitchen opens into the dining room, allowing guests to see their food as it comes out.

On my first visit I enjoyed a raisin brioche french toast with greek yogurt, fresh fruit, and almonds, which offered just the right amount of sweetness.  On the second visit I enjoyed eggs benedict with spinach and thick cut potatoes, which was hearty and delicious.  On both visits I had bottomless coffee and was able to enjoy the food and ambience without feeling rushed

This would definitely be my go-to brunch spot if I lived in Toronto.   Rumor has it they may soon be opening a New York store :)"}
{"text":"My bachelor party crew of 11 stormed into this establishment on a hungover Saturday morning.  I'm pretty sure we horrified the mostly french-canadien staff with our group of 10 asians and 1 white guy. 

Anyways, I got a basic breakfast (sunny up eggs, toasts, sausage) that had a few twists to it.  For one, I've never eaten baked beans for breakfast, but i surprisingly enjoyed them.  The home fries came in a form of grilled potato disks, which were ok.  Fresh fruit was neatly sliced and on the side.  In other words, a breakfast that can't be screwed up was not screwed up.  

As a side note, the waiter spilled baked beans on one of the guys.  It was more funny than annoying."}
{"text":"This visit sure made me sad - or, I could say, it was far from meeting my... eggspectations :').

My excitement during my first prance through Yonge and Dundas and the very first time I laid eyes on Eggspectation was immense! I am a lover of puns, so I only imagined for this to be the most whimsical, most perfect spot for me. 

After much research (= scrolling through Instagram), I decided that I was going to go for the Eggsuberant ($12.95), this massive plate came with \"Two Fluffy Pancakes, Maple Syrup, Sausages, Grilled Tomatoes\" and, their famous \"Lyonnaise-style Potatoes\". 

Seated for 1PM (for one - yes, I had brunch by myself), with only one other table seated. Upon ordering, I went for three items. I... only ended up receiving my plate of goods. I reminded the gal about my Maple Baked Beans ($2.45)... and decided not to call for my Shake, just to see if she'd end up remembering. She didn't.

The worst pancakes I've ever had, so stiff - why??! I also absolutely did not enjoy their eggs. I never thought I'd say that about eggs. I love eggs! Sad story.

I'd rather go for a below-average breakie elsewhere.

Also... I still don't understand the relevance of the Egyptian logo... Who and what is Egyptian here?!"}
{"text":"Excellent, quick service. There was a line out the door when we arrived, but we waited no more than 10 minutes for a table. The food was incredible, everything we ordered was simply delicious. I are the French toast and eggs with their specialty breakfast potatoes and my husband ordered juice and the breakfast poutine. The poutine especially was our favorite. 

The portions were decently sized, enough that we were both full after our meal, but not too large that we felt sick afterward. The price point is great too, for the quality and amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Our brunch was really good. I got the Montreal style eggs benedict and it was yummy. We sat at the bar so my wife got a bloody Mary. It was way too think and had too much tomatoe sauce, but the bartenders were very friendly and attentive. They gave us good suggestions for different places to eat and dance. Over it was great food and good service. I'm giving it four starts because the white part of my eggs were not cooked and that makes me gag."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Eggspectation a bunch of times, in spite of the terrible pun, due to lack of options in the area. I walked in with pretty low expectations, but ended up being super impressed with the lobster benny. Whoah that thing is good. It's really crowded and loud but the service was still pretty fast. If you can, drink up your coffee before you arrive because the coffee served here is not very good."}
{"text":"I spent a week in Toronto inhaling as much food as I possibly could, and I have to say, Eggspectation was the one place I was truly sorry I would not be able to return to and dine at again. 

Firstly, I do not understand why anybody would ever eat anything besides breakfast food--specifically, egg-based breakfast food (people are idiots, Leslie). 

Secondly, the restaurant's name is Eggspectation, and all their dish titles are egg-related puns. 

Thirdly, the menu is ENORMOUS (which isn't always a good thing, but in this case, is the best thing that has ever happened on planet earth) and offers equal and ample opportunity to satiate all salt, sweet, & savory cravings. All the dishes were appealing, and a small part of me died knowing social and health etiquette would only permit me to order one thing. Finally, even though the portions were pretty small, the food was DELICIOUS, and the presentation made the food look as fresh, bright and delicious as it tasted. I had the salmon benny and my friends had the brioche beauty & and some type of breakfast platter (fried eggs, ham, potato slices, pancakes).... and everything was simply amazing and to die for!!! I wish so badly I could go back!"}
{"text":"6/28/2015
Just be prepared for a wait, but its worth it!

A very large selection of benedicts and omelettes to satisfy anyone's breakfast whim for the morning.

The shakes were good too!

If you're looking for a casual great-tasting breakfast, give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is good, but not amazing. I enjoyed the food, but it was pretty slow service, and I think Universal (just a couple blocks away) is overall better brunch. Come to eggspectation if the wait is too long at Universal, and you'll still have a nice brunch."}
{"text":"My recent visit here was coloured a little by the initial service.  We came for a business breakfast at around 8:30am, and the hostess was a bit flustered - apparently there was only one waiter that showed for the entire restaurant.  Therefore, despite the restaurant being nearly empty, she couldn't seat us.  We grabbed a seat behind her just to chat and we ended up being seated around 20 minutes later when another waiter showed up.

The food was good - can't complain about the omelettes.  It was a bit pricey, but the selection is good.  I would go back as I assume this episode was an anomaly."}
{"text":"No words describe this place, other than AMAZING!!

We got seated as soon as we walked in.. Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.. even made recommendations for us to try! We had the French toast, classic eggs benedict, the 'eggspectation' burger, and maple leaf cocktails. 

Honestly hands down probably the best all around meal we have had during our trip to Toronto!

Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Eggspectation in Toronto in a while (they have locations in Montreal as well), but the other day, after a horrible experience at Fran's, we decided to head over to somewhere tried and true.

The place may be filled with tourists, but you shouldn't judge them based on that. They just happen to have a great central location, and therefore a lot of traffic.

Things that are awesome about this place:

1) Eggs! I love eggs. There is a book full of options for egg-lovers and haters alike, and the food is delicious. I was a fan of the Eggs Benedict, and I have that EVERYWHERE, so I'd like to think I've become a bit of an expert on Hollandaise sauce. Lots of options for people who want to make their meals a little bit healthier, like the option to have salad instead of home fries, and freshly squeezed juice. Yum.

2) FASTEST SERVICE EVER. This place knows how to deal with a crowd. Our waiter was friendly and efficient -- he didn't bullshit us with small talk, he got down to business, cracked a joke, and brought us our food before I was even half-done my orange juice!

3) An open kitchen. So you can see the cooks at work, and you can see when the line is busy if your food is going to be a while. Not that that was the case at all, but it's nice to be aware of these things.

4) Great management and owners who are on the floor and involved in everything that goes on.

5) Lots of seating, and great people watching spots close to the window.

So if you're around the Eaton Centre and you're wary of Eggspectation because it might be a tourist trap, think again. It's one of the few great chains in this country, and definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This particular branch leaves much to be desired! The service felt very rushed....in fact, the server was preoccupied with other things, and not only pushy, but quite argumentative. He checked on us twice, once to take our order (which he rushed through) and once to collect our money. The food was very bland, and the toast was charred when it was served. Not a good breakfast choice with so many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Waited for 45 min for a table for two. When we were finally seated inside a third of the tables were empty. If you can't staff up for busy days that's on management. Food was ok but pricey for what you got. I had to wait 15 min for my toast after the eggs came out."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 8 for brunch on a Saturday. Enjoyed everything. Would definitely recommend to visit. Made a reservation but once we arrived we were seated rather quickly, so there was no need. We each ordered a mimosa. My group agreed they preferred the mango mimosas because it was sweeter. 

The menu had so many options. Eggs cooked every way you can imagine. They also offered a lunch menu if burgers and other items if breakfast isn't your thing. 
Myself and 3 others ordered the lobster omelette which was so good. I never finish a plate of food, I had to hold my urge to lick the plate. 
Service was pleasant and fast. Our waiter was able to tell us about almost everything on the menu. 

Know they've expanded to a few locations in the US, looking forward to checking these out as well."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend after finally being able to find some parking. Really great food and fast service! The waitress was really kind and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"eggs benedict on belgian waffles is such an awesome combination, definitely worth the try!!"}
{"text":"Wow a wonderful selection of delicious from healthy to decadent meals & highest quality & great service differently  coming back again."}
{"text":"Definitely with out a doubt favorite breakfast place in Toronto! .They never disappoint! Always consistent! .Tried the montrealer! .It consisted of Montreal smoked meat,2 eggs homefries which are awesome! And toast! .Was a nice change! .Prices are very reasonable! .My had classic eggs bennidict and did not disappoint! .Fast friendly service! .10 out of 10!"}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal we were staying at a hotel located near this restaurant, so we decided to give it a try! It has a chain restaurant feel to it, and a really large menu. I wasn't expecting anything great but to my surprise it was delicious. I had the classic eggs Benedict and it was prepared perfectly. They try to get you in and out pretty quickly on weekends, which is why this wasn't 5 stars."}
{"text":"Yum!! The first restaurant I tried in Montréal, recommended by my local friend, and it was nothing close to a disappointment! I had a mimosa and the fresh-squeezed orange juice made it an easy 10/10. The menu has many great options, though I chose a simple eggs benedict...one of the best i've ever had! My friends all equally enjoyed their food and we agreed we'd come back before we leave. Cute atmosphere with really great, kind service."}
{"text":"Die Bedienung war schnell und sehr freundlich, das Frühstück (Pancakes mit Erdbeeren und Ahornsirup plus tropical saft) war sehr sehr lecker ! Zum Cappucino gabs ein 0.3 dl Gratis Wasser dazu. Das Restaurant ist ein absolutes Muss!! Die Lage ist sehr praktisch, es liegt direkt neben dem Easton Shopping Centre."}
{"text":"I had pretty high eggspectations for this one but unfortunately I found it to be not as eggceptional as I'd hoped. What a eggdown... err let down.

Showed up relatively early for a Sunday morning around 10 or so only to find it filled to capacity and a growing 15 minute wait for a table for 2. A small waiting area is available and free wifi to help pass the time.

Upon being seated, not too much fuss or frills. Just a busy breakfast diner with everyone trying to make their rounds. After some menu studying, I decided to keep my poutine streak going and went for the breakfast poutine. Rather than using fries, some thinly sliced seasoned potatoes topped with gravy, cheese, onions, bits of sausage, bacon, and of a course an EGG. Okay sized portion but was kind of just bland overall. The wifey had some sort combo option complete with french toast, eggs, fruit, sausage, and a side of potatoes as well. Lots of food, but mediocre.

Anyways, location was nice as it was right across the way from the ice rink / picture worthy TORONTO sign, but not much else I got for you on this one. Wasn't a fan of it and I feel like there are better options out there for brunch.

'Til next time!"}
{"text":"EggSpectation, more like \"Disappointation\"...
After spending a long cold morning at the Womans Right March i worked up quite the appetite. The food they post online/website look nothing like  the pictures they post. Pancakes arent fresh, their pre-made/frozen and flat like earth. No fluffiness whatsoever.. The Bacon i had was thin like floss and super chewy like gum..  I had high hopes for this place after seeing the pictures and post reviews online.. The best thing about this place was the toast with peanut butter, potatoes and the Mimosas...
I wont be eating here ever again..i would have taken and posted pictures, but my phone was frozen from standing in the freezing cold holding up signs protesting equality... Apparently all pancakes & bacon arent made equal.."}
{"text":"3.75 to be exact.

With a great atmosphere they have inside, Eggspectation Dejeuner definitely met my expectations! Specializing for breakfast, and more specifically eggs, this is definitely known by many people, as the place itself is a good size, but during peak hours in the morning there is typically a wait.  If it is a nice day you can find some seating outside as well which would alleviate longer waits.

No worries if you are not actually feeling eggs, as Eggspectation does have a bunch of main dishes without eggs, such as crepes, French toast, and pancakes.  I started my breakfast here with freshly squeezed orange juice, and to note, they do provide many freshly made fruit drinks here which is a plus!  I ended up getting the Chicken Benedict.  The eggs were poached perfectly as the yolk would ooze out upon opening, which went well with the potatoes I had on the side.  I would definitely suggest doing this with the potatoes, as the seasoning I had on my potatoes just made them taste okay otherwise.  The chicken was cooked well too and was not dry so I had no complaints there.

Overall, I would definitely come back here for breakfast on another trip to this city!"}
{"text":"This place feels like a hotel restaurant, but with better food. They have touches of trends in their decor, but it still feels like a generic chain restaurant. There aren't a lot of places to get breakfast in Toronto, though, so this is a solid bet.

The food is plentiful and most of it is excellent. The lobster benny was awesome. The potatoes are kind of sad. The fruit was hit or miss - it seems like they have no issue putting things out that other cafes would throw away. The staff was super friendly both times we went. The best part, though, is that there appears to never be a wait for a table. Win.

They have wifi, which was a blessing when we had a little extra time to kill before heading to the airport. And since there was no one waiting, I didn't feel guilty about hanging around for a second cup of coffee.

The one serious con. The bathroom situation. I'm hoping they've brought in a plumber since I last saw it, but it appeared that only 1 out of 3 toilets was working. I walked in and walked out."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast all the way around. Eggs: bangin. Bacon: bangin. Hasbrowns: bangin. French Toast: tasted like birthday cake, therefore bangin. Delicious fresh fruit with every meal. No judgmental looks when I ordered a gin-based drink at 11 am (The Julz, which I highly recommend). We were sitting outside and it started pouring, so they swiftly moved us indoors and gave my friend a free mimosa. Our waiter Mike was the nicest guy ever, such a ray of sunshine I wanted to tip him my entire savings account. We came here for breakfast three times on a 4-day trip and had him as our sever twice. Ma boooiiiiiiiii"}
{"text":"The services is great! Warning: stick to breakfast food. I've been before for their breakfast or crepes it was good, but steak and fries was mediocre at best. They overcooked the steaks significantly. The fries seem frozen."}
{"text":"We went with two young kids (5 and 2) on vacation. Great service. Kids loved food. Great smoothies."}
{"text":"Amazing salmon Benedict! This was a superb way to end my trip to Toronto. The service was very quick as well which I appreciated as I had to head to the airport right after."}
{"text":"I walked in with a small group as we were simply hungry and passing by. Mediocre food and service. Surprised to see some high ratings.

It's not a place I'd necessarily recommend or make my way to visit again."}
{"text":"Solid brunch/breakfast spot. Was surprised to see no wait on a Sunday at 11 am (I guess they're not into brunch as much as NYers?), but I'm not complaining.

Huge menu selection- omelettes, Benedicts, pancakes, waffles, French toast, etc. Prices are not too bad, mostly averaging $10-12 per dish. 

My smores French toast was okay- slightly dry, but I enjoyed the loads of Nutella. Boyfriend raved about Belgian waffle- claiming it's the best he's ever had. So do get a waffle and a side of the lyonnaise potatoes- they were delish."}
{"text":"Des assiettes avec des bons produits.
Un service très attentif à la clientèle.
A refaire mais dans une autre succursale pour changer de quartier."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch location. Service was very fast, food was delicious, lobster was great! Orange Juice was fresh af. A bit expensive, but definitely worth it.

My girlfriend ordered the lobster Mac and cheese, and it blew my mind. The plate came with two pieces of garlic bread that was buttered to perfection, definitely the greatest garlic bread I've ever had. The lobster Mac and cheese itself was magnificent, with more lobster meat than you'd expect. The cheese was delightful, and the macaroni itself was cooked perfectly. Everything felt like it would melt in your mouth.

I ordered an omelette, which was great, but not amazing. It came with sweet potato fries, which were dry, but dipped in the sauce it was great.

Finally, their orange juice was fresh and delicious. I lament that it costs 3.50, and I hope they would lower their price in the future.

Food arrived blazingly fast, or so it felt. Service was very friendly. There were quite a few flies in the restaurant, however. 

Overall, great experience. I would bring my friends here when I'm downtown."}
{"text":"Stopped here for some breakfast on our second day in Montreal and everything was delicious. A fairly large brunch menu with so many options to mix and match your favorite breakfasts. Their potatoes are delicious-you have the option to substitute those for fruit but I still got a few pieces on my plate anyways. The eggs and brioche are delicious, the service was great. Gets crowded around lunch time but still a really cool atmosphere. Waiters and waitresses spoke English and French very well. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a big breakfast/brunch!!"}
{"text":"I (L) Oy Vegg !!

Fav. hangover meal at Eggspectation! 

Came here a few days ago with my sister who is very pickey/ vegetarian and she loved everything !"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! The potatoes are awesome! The service is usually very welcoming and fast. Have never been disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Went to breakfast in a large group and were serve up some dleicious breakfast dishes. I had an Montreal style smoked meat omelette. Really delicious and the place was very busy and service was quick and very good. The cups of coffee tended to be small so needed quite a few refills. This is part of a chain of breakfast type restaurants"}
{"text":"Great food. Great place. Friendly staff~ Got seated as soon as walked in. Love the smoothie and juice all freshly made.pretty good choice for a weekend brunch."}
{"text":"I try not to eat at places with eggy puns in their name. I don't know why, but I find these kind of puns most distasteful. After all, G is no substitute for an X. Egg-celence? Egg-citement? Really?

Having said all that I like Eggspectations. Despite being in as touristy a spot you could imagine -- embedded right in the side of the Eaton Centre -- it's a swell location. Something you may not realise until walk in is that this place is egg-poppingly huge. I'd estimate that their upper level seats about a million.

Their menu is similarly ginormous. It's about nine pages long and features crêpes, burgers, sandos, bennies, omelettes and a portion devoted to their \"Signature Dishes.\" If you're allergic to egg puns, you might want to avoid this page.

When I was there I got a pretty standard breakfast. Eggs over easy, bacon, homefries. It was respectable, and my morning cocktail was solid too. Not a bad spot for breakfast any time of day.

Obligatory Title Pun: I'm going to OVOID over-punning this one.

Menu Readability: Written in a script typeface that makes me want to murder someone.

Need to mention: Toast is extra. What's up with that?

What this place teaches me about myself: You think you can out-pun me Eggspectations? YOLKS on you, eggheads!"}
{"text":"Recently visited Eggspectation for brunch and I was very impressed!  We got there around 11:30 and had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table, which wasn't bad since we wanted a table outside.  The menu has so many options but we ended up sharing french toast, chocolate chip pancakes, and an omelet.  Everything tasted great.  I'm always hesitant when a restaurant has so many food options, but it wasn't a concern at all.  The service was amazing too.  Our waiter was super busy but made sure we enjoyed our meal from start to finish.  I wanted to order some toast with my meal and he said he would just slip in some pieces with our order.  Since the restaurant was busy, he brought out some toast early - nice touch.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pour les amoureux des déjeuners, Eggspectation est un bon endroit pour y trouver un mélange de mets classiques et d'autres un peu différents.

Mon met préféré est le Bagel Doré servis avec fraises, bananes, yogourt nature et miel. Miam!

Le café filtre est habituellement à volonté, à condition d'avoir un serveur attentioné qui viens vous voir régulièrement. Sinon, vous pouvez parfois attendre avant de refaire le plein!

La nourriture est bonne, mais parfois tiède. L'ambiance est bonne mais quelque peu commerciale puisque ce n'est qu'un resto parmis plusieurs de la même franchise."}
{"text":"I dropped by here on Saturday morning, and had no wait! (always a hard find with brunch). There is a ton of seating here, it was pretty full, and yet the service was still incredibly fast. I swear we ordered and our food was out within 10-15 minutes. It was hot and fresh. 

First of all, if you are a fan of pulpy fresh orange juice, you HAVE To try their orange juice. It is so thick, and so fresh - it's to die for. I got the avocado and bacon eggs benedict. Everything about it was great! The bacon was perfectly cooked, the avocado was fresh, the eggs were runny, and the hollandaise tasted amazing. I'm honestly still just blown away by how quickly our food came out. 

Not only is the food tasty and the service fast, the name of this cafe is also a pun. How can you say no??"}
{"text":"Went on a monday so there was no line for brunch and the service was super quick! I got smoked salmon eggs benedict and shared a classic poutine. The eggs benedict was good but it was very lukewarm. For me personally, temperature is one of the most important factors of a good eggs benny because no one wants some cold, runny eggs, right? Also it came with some fruit salad but it was also a bit soggy and had a tinge of sourness. I was a bit dissapointed. The classic poutine was good, came with a good portion for the price but nothing special. Still, the food was okay, but with Montreals many fantastic brunch places, I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite brunch place in Toronto! 

Great convenient location right outside eaton center and in a relatively quiet area and close to Nathan Phillips square as well. 

The eggs Benedict here are amazing and have great unique choices! The service is friendly and fast and the fresh juices here is hard to come by! 

Definitely recommend as a good brunch place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"swift service! we were seated and served within 15 minutes and finished our meal within 30-45 minutes, just as we had hoped for. The eggs benedict are also very fast to prepare, so I can't guarantee it will be the case for everyone looking for fast service. The food was good. The hollandaise sauce was a little sour, but otherwise a very nice meal."}
{"text":"I was amazed by the Yelp waitlist system. I only waited for 5 minutes when I arrived when there were already like 20 people there waiting. Service is a bit slow this time, but still acceptable. Egg was overcooked a bit and one of the toasts are burnt, but overall I will give it a 8.5/10."}
{"text":"Y-U-M

Wish they had this chain in NYC. Great food, cute environment, yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Very functional breakfast. I had the Smoked Salmon Benedict. Hollandaise sauce was fine maybe a little more lemon would have helped and dish could have used more cheese which was the intriguing ingredient to the meal. The breakfast potatoes were very good with a crisp outer surrounding tenderness (but not mushy). 

Not a high class breakfast but they don't pretend to be."}
{"text":"Nice location, tucked in on a small side street between the Eaton Centre and  City Hall.  Great patio in the summer.  In the winter, the patio furniture is covered in a huge black tarp that makes for an awful eyesore for the window seating inside the restaurant.  (Honestly, could they put that into storage? No one wants a window seat, and the place looks empty from the outside.)  The interior is clean and modern.

The best thing on the menu is the Tropical Pagé smoothie: a huge portion (milkshake size) of fresh, thick, fruit-filled smoothie.  Very substantial, and a steal at $5.45.  Better than their coffee and a good alternative to their overpriced dessert crepes.

I ordered the lobster benny and did not get the same dish that other reviewers have raved about.  The largest piece of lobster I found could only be described as a morsel, about the size of a TicTac: no pieces of claw meat as shown in some of the photos below.  I honestly could not tell you if the lobster didn't come from out of a can; it had the texture of canned salad crab. The eggs were perfectly cooked, and the hollandaise sauce was tasty with good lobster flavour. The potatoes Lyonnaise were ok, though not as fantastic as the description in the menu. All in all, it was a good dish, but for $16.95 I expect more lobster and more sauce.

Service was fast and efficient, though somewhat subdued. I had just missed the lunch rush; so the place was nearly empty at 2:30pm.

Overall, it's about the same level as an OverEasy or Sunset Grill, but the premium location means a few extra $. A good choice at the Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"Sat for literally ten minutes without so much as a water. Sweet lord! I thought hospitality in Canada was supposed to be great! Worst restaurant experience one could have: waiting for water."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast as it was close to our hotel (walking distance) and my cousin wanted to eat here. I've never been but it's comparable to.. Eggsmart in Toronto though I find this place just a little better. They had a lot of things on their menu so you may get a little overwhelmed. I decided to get an omelette because there was a picture of it on the menu with avocados (love them btw). Food came out quickly and our server was very attentive to us and filled up our coffee whenever we needed. 

The portion of my dish was HUGE. I honestly couldn't finish it but I tried really hard to stuff myself before the long ride back home to Toronto. Food was good, nothing too special here but I enjoyed our service. We asked for our bills and he was able to split it up for us (which makes it soo much easier) and explored the shops downstairs. It was like a mini mall and had a few decent shops down there."}
{"text":"Are you ready for an eggsxiting adventure? Something uneggspected? Well hold on to your horses and ready up for Eggspectations. A modern, hipster diner specializing in, you guessed it - ham. Just kidding, it's sausages. And I heard they have eggs here too. Yeah probably.  Let's get crackin'

Pros:
+ lots and lots of breakfast and American dishes here. 
+ lots of white people eat here so you know it's the ish. 
+ nice wooden decor and design and open spaces with huge windows for eggsquisite lighting on your Instagram photos. 
+ they open early @ 7 am. 
+ free WiFi? But you need to ask them for the password. 
+ uniforms here are blue jeans and a plaid shirt. Casual yet stylish. Love it! 
+ the chairs are painted to look worn and used, but aren't! That's sweet man. Yo can I get some tips on how to do this? 
+ presentation of dishes very appealing. The colors also complement the warm lighting of the place, further highlighting the asthetic appeal of the dish. 
+ variety of fresh fruits accompany every dish. Light and filling. 
+ everyone liked their dishes. Only one of the eggs poached a little too long. Other than that everyone's was poached perfectly! Break out that #yolkporn 

Cons:
- all dishes did not come out at the same time. All my friend's dishes came out, but I had to wait for mine. I only ordered eggs and salmon on a bagel... Wtf. 

Overall a good breakfast place if you love eggs! I'm not yolking"}
{"text":"Wandering Montreal and looking for a beer, we found Eggspectation. Pitchers of Rickards went down well and with a nice Caesar salad. Their menu is focused mostly on eggs (duh) but they offer salads and burgers too.

Outside seating has a great view of the square where the Jazz Festival sets up, so if you want to enjoy that, go ahead. We sat inside with a view of the television so that we could watch the Euro Cup final and drink beer.

Very pleasant waitress, a chicken Caesar salad and a delicious pitcher of Richard's White beer later, we were off. Good time, I would recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to have breakfast/brunch in the city!

I usually stick to the Eggs Florentine, which is just right and a good vegetarian option for those who like Egg Benedicts.

Last time I went, I opted for a change, and I got the Pancake Page. Absolutely delicious, it's piled with fruits, and has cream anglaise on the side along with maple syrup. Very good breakfast option and good service!"}
{"text":"this is the restaurant that moved from the eaton centre but the similarity ends there! new owners, great staff and the food was amazing. was apprehensive to come back but will be returning regularly now! fantastic turn around :) the lobster benny is loaded with fresh and delicious lobster!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say this is the worst Eggspectation we've ever been to! The staff are nice but the food is horrible! The best way to describe the food would be stale and tasteless! Nothing was fresh or flavourful. At one point the supervisor (I think) stopped by to ask how tings were but completely passed over my response of 'well.....ok' and moved on to ask if we wanted more syrup. 

Requested soft boiled eggs were hard. Sausages were hard, potatoes weren't fresh, hollandaise sauce tasted like nothing....and on and on!

Overall very disappointed by the food quality. Almost regret paying.

There are other places around - don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. Came here with our kids while on vacation for a few days and they gave a great choice for menu items for our whole family and I'm gluten free. Good service despite being super busy. Recommend for sure."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp, but at the time it was too far from that day's destination.  But returning from our Free Walking Tour of Toronto with Adam, on the Esplanade we found it.  Since reviews had been positive we decided to try it.  The panini was delicious and so was the flat bread."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff, extensive menu and excellent execution. Waffles or French toast are delicious. Breakfast doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"2.5**
Eggspectation fell from it's pedestal in the early 2000's. The menu is nothing to rave about, while their execution is plane at best. Chocolate Chip Pancakes are simply drizzled with chips and not mixed in the batter like they should. In addition the wait is terrible. Egg-pecte to wait. If you have a chance, try Allo Mon CoCo!"}
{"text":"I went to Eggspectation for brunch on a Sunday and was met with absurdly quick service considering the volume of people in the dining room (but it may have also been because I ordered a standard menu item). I was really impressed! The omelette was gooey and cheesy, just the way I wanted it, and the \"shoestring\" homefries are salty and oiled up just right. I also ordered a fancy tropical smoothie to accompany my meal before heading off for a day of shopping at Eaton Centre.

I have heard from other people that Eggspectation is open for dinner, yet they don't serve breakfast items after a certain time - if so, that's a bit disappointing. IMO they should serve breakfast any time they're open!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast for the family before exploring the city.  Large portions. Delicious potatoes.  Crepes are amazing in the Sugar Shack.  Had to try Breakfast Poutine.  Nutella Banana pancakes worth coming back for.  Great service. Fair prices."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Their menu is HUGE and if you are a fan of eggs this is the place for you.

Here it can get really busy at all hours of the day.  I came here Monday afternoon at 1p and it was packed where we had to wait 15minutes for an outdoor seat.  No wait for indoor seating.

Service was good, prices are decent, food is good, atmosphere is nice and portions are big.

I wish there was an Eggspectations in New York."}
{"text":"Charming concept, I thought. Eggs were actually poached perfectly! Overpriced, but food was decent. It was empty when we went, so the service was excellent but how could it not be?Overall, good. I'd go again, although I'd try dinner. Not a place I'd go often for breakfast, just too overpriced."}
{"text":"My friends & I went to Toronto for a little trip & I saw this was a highly rated place on Yelp. We went on a Sunday morning I believe & there was about a 30 minute wait. Not bad. Got seated & most of us ordered the original mimosa or the mango mimosa. Both were delicious. I ordered the lobster Benedict with a side of french toast. SO delicious. I also got to try the salmon benedict. I'm a huge eggs benedict fan so I've tried a ton in different places. But theres were amazing. I love how the english muffin under was soft  from whatever sauce they used on the lobster. & it was a big portion that came with a good amount of fruit on the side. It was an explosion of flavor in your mouth, honestly. & the french toast was perfect. Probably because their maple syrup is so good lol. But it was so good, I wanted to come back before the trip was over but we couldn't."}
{"text":"It was ok.  The food is fresh and good quality.  However I got the bravaccado it was a take on a Benedict, the flavor was great but the egg was over cooked.  To highlight eggs as the restaurant, they should be the highlight and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"My Sunday brunch was just amazing! Really delicious! Their Salmon egg Benedict with the fruit salad is a perfect combination! Don't ask for potatoes, please! It was the first time I tried it, but surely coming back before I leave Montreal. No complaints for the service. My waitress was cool and helpful"}
{"text":"Nice and clean spot. Good food and apple juice. Great amount of food portion. I was happy with the service provided by Zach as well. He served us with a smile."}
{"text":"Lobster Benny was really good. It would have been 5 stars if the eggs were runny and not over cooked."}
{"text":"My friends and I Went there last year in May. We were looking for a place to eat breakfast and came across this place. I just want to say that the food is really good, the presentation of each plate was really nice. Very friendly staff, good place for groups and every different plate of food we order were really good. If you are in the Montreal area I recommend this place. 
Just know to give yourself some time because they are busy."}
{"text":"Love the amount of breakfast choices they have here!!! It's cheap for the the amount of food one gets!! There are choices for people with sweet and savory tooth"}
{"text":"Positives: we were seated right away, and our server was nice.
Negatives: the fruit that came with our eggs benedict was dry, and the restaurant is lacking cleanliness."}
{"text":"Fabulous eggs benedict and waffles. The french toast was kind of mediocre but we came here two days in a row because of the friendly service and willing to adjust items due to food allergies. Both days I got the chicken eggs benedict the first day were the potatoes and the next day I paid a little extra for the garden salad which was pretty average. Husband got waffles first day which were excellent but the French Toast he got the second day was quite average. Tons of seating including outdoor I would love to come back"}
{"text":"Great place for a decent breakfast...I especially am hooked on the California Benedict.  Very tasty, but on the \"tubby\" side for sure.  Smoked salmon w/ breakfast is great!!  Also enjoy the fresh squeezed juice!"}

{"text":"Great breakfast place that gives you a good portion of fruits along with your meal. Their portions are perfect and mine was cooked to exactly what i ordered I would come back to the place again for solid consistent good breakfast food."}
{"text":"Being in MTL, you always feel the pressure to have brunch somewhere special and nice, so eggspectation, a chain, is not your first choice. But, honestly, it has great hearty food, and has great service. I especially like their brioche french toast"}
{"text":"It was okay.  Ive been to an eggspectation in veiux montreal which was suberb.  Overall the food was okay.  The service however was outstanding."}
{"text":"Love their portion sizes! I always leave feeling super full. Their service is great, it's always busy with a crowd any time you go which is always a positive! I would definitely recommend going but make reservations or use the waiting app instead of waiting in the right space by the door!"}
{"text":"Have you ever ordered a dish, and then when the waiter comes over with a plate and says, \"[ridiculous, punny name]?\"...you just wanted to deny that you actually ordered that thing?

That's how I felt about the \"Yolk Around the Clock.\"

This dish was so visibly unappetizing, and once I started eating I confirmed that it also tasted pretty gross as well. The eggs were overcooked as opposed to overeasy, the bagels were burned, the cheese was burned, the \"perfectly spiced Lyonnaise potatoes\" needed salt, pepper, and much, much less cardboard inside.

It's not that it was inedible, it's just that it wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Good service, accommodated our needs, all the meals were delish, awesome fresh grapefruit mimosa"}
{"text":"Went here the morning after a bachelorette party. My friend ordered the BLT with avocado, specifying that she was celiac and needed gluten free bread. The waitress brought the BLT on gluten free bread.. with fries she couldn't eat. She had to notify the waitress again that she needed a GF breakfast. The staff was understanding and switched out her fries with fruit. I received my salmon eggs Benedict with the eggs poached hard and a small dollop of hollandaise. I told our waitress, who was totally understanding and switched my plate over for a new Benedict. She explained that they had recently changed the menu and the cooks were overwhelmed. Overall, too many mistakes were made to justify such high wait times and prices. Drinks on the menu were priced differently (advertised $7 mimosas when it was actually $8), allergies weren't taken into concern, and staple breakfast items weren't cooked properly."}
{"text":"Delicioso!!! Muy recomendable, el ambiente, la atención, los platillos de vegetales y frutas frescas, todo muy bien!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff with eggs-cetional service and eggs-cellent food. I ordered the Eggstravaganza breakfast. The eggs were good, but the kicker were the lyonnaise-style potatoes and brioche French toasts with maple syrup. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Para desayunar es de lo mejor que he probado. De verdad. Es todo: el sitio, el ambiente, los camareros y por supuesto la comida!!! 

Los huevos de todas las maneras, sabores y  texturas los cocinan y ademas todo tipo de tortitas, wafles, brioches.. Yo me he pedido hoy un brioches en plan sandwiches de nocilla con nubes... Mira mira mira... IMPRESIONANTE!!!"}
{"text":"Lots of different options here for breakfast.  My Mocha Coffee was very good and they offer fresh squeezed orange juice which is always great.  My wife loved her omelette and especially the potatoes.  I had the bacon waffle eggs benedict but was disappointed in the waffle.  Capped it off with a nutella banana crepe dessert which was delicious."}
{"text":"Let's say one word... BRUNCH!! 

The place is centrally located, close to the Old City Hall. It has sits outside and inside. Gets very busy but you can add yourself to the waiting list through Yelp (is a plus). When I arrived my waiting time was 5 minutes and although they had tables that were empty, they did not had the servers but it was ok. It took only 5 minutes to get my table. 

The server was prompt, answer all of our questions and gave her recommendations (which all were pretty good). They use organic/fresh products, and you can have really good healthy choices to choose from. We ordered food for 4 because I wanted to try the Canadian Maple syrup and oh boy... that was  good. Their potatoes are to die for as well. 

I wish I have an Eggspectation close by because I will be there every weekend!"}
{"text":"Love it! Will come again. Our waiter was fantastic! Food was great! Will give their lunch menu a try! 
We had the all American breakfast on a Saturday morning, it was fresh and quick! They also served rye bread, which was a wonderful option! Nothing can go wrong with breakfast food."}
{"text":"TLDR: Good Service, clean environment, and decent food for a chain! 


Much like my review on the Eggspectation in Toronto, they offer fabulous service. To start off, we were greeted immediately after being seen. My first scan of the restaurant was, clean, but they needed new chairs! We sat near the windows, and behind us was the bar. I pulled out my chair and was cut by something sharp (there was a board behind us), and the server gave me a bandaid. Anyways, we placed our order and the food came out relatively quickly. Compared to most breakfast places that I have been to, Eggspectation offers a large variety of breakfast and lunch items, it was hard for me to pick which one I wanted - I ended up with the eggstravaganza (french toast, choice of ham/bacon/sausage, two eggs, home fries and fruits) - my eyes were clearly bigger than my stomach (typical me)!! 

Anyways, if you're in Montreal, around the area, never been to Eggspectation, and it's -30 out, then you should try it. If you've been, I do recommend visiting other joints as there are many breakfast/brunch places in the area!"}
{"text":"Not bad. We came here for brunch on a Tuesday morning after our flight from NYC. We were starving and looking for a breakfast spot in our hotel's area. Found this place on Yelp and went with it. We ordered the Classic Poutine to start. It was not bad. If you're from the NYC/Tristate area, this is like our version of Disco Fries that you order at a diner. The only difference is that the Poutine has cheese curds instead of sliced cheese.

For our entrees I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict.. it was good, but for some odd reason my dish came out luke warm to cold. Plus, the hollandaise sauce was a tad sour. My friend ordered the Croque Monsieur. She was disappointed in the sandwich. It was not the classic recipe which is made with béchamel sauce. It was literally a ham and cheese panini with tomato. I took a bite as well, and although it was tasty, it was not a real Croque Monsieur. We've had better in NYC.

I ordered a smoothie and it was ok. Service was friendly. I think this place is a chain and they have other locations. I would go back and give it another try, but with so many great places to eat in Montreal, why bother?"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of anywhere that serves many types of Eggs Benedict, and my family was in town and staying at the near-by Delta Chelsea, so this touristy spot seemed appropriate.

We walked in and were asked to wait for a little while, and they were busy so it was understandable. Then they took us up some stairs to the left of the entrance behind their coffee and juice bar station. It was pretty ridiculous, no one was around us and when we looked up we realized there was no finished ceiling above us. It was a bunch of exposed pipes, some of which were covered in plastic bags. Aesthetically, the rest of the restaurant is huge and clean, so this was just a really unfortunate place to be sat. This strange location also made it hard to order... tic toc...

Finally we ordered. Spoiler Alert: we all got eggs. I got the Eggs Benny on a crepe with a side of baked beans. It was actually quite yummy. Everyone else around me complained about their choices, and did the \"mine's slimy want to try it?\" thing. Who wants to try something after they're told it's gross?! Not this girl. 

Our server was mainly absent through the meal, but we befriended a bus person who was really helpful at bringing us condiments, sides and mid-breakfast beverages. I wish I'd gotten his name. He rocked.

Egg-ceptionally average tourist place, and I likely won't return. Mom and pop breakfast spots are where it's at... everyone knows that!

BEWARE ESPRESSO LOVERS: My cousin ordered a machiatto. It was very obvious that it was just a normal coffee with hot foam. Damn shame."}
{"text":"Good food, not so great service.  You really can't mess up breakfast.  It's probably the easiest meal of the day.   However, this place couldn't get it right.  The eggs were a bit cold (who wants to eat cold eggs?!).  My husband enjoyed the smoothie and I liked the fruit added to the plate.  Also, the potatoes that come with the order are good as well.  I would go back and I would recommend this place for breakfast because, like I said, the food was good!"}
{"text":"Eggspectation reminds me of Panera (in America). I knew that Montreal is known for their bagels so when I ate breakfast here I made sure to get one for breakfast. I ordered the BLT breakfast sandwich on a sesame bagel. I substituted my potatoes/fries with fruit. Overall it was a great simple breakfast. My brother wanted to try poutine in Montreal and so he ordered the Breakfast Poutine. It's definitely full of carbs and filling to say the least lol

Service was good and we were in and out in under an hour which was a great start to our day because we had a lot planned!"}
{"text":"Go bananas smoothie
Eggstravaganza- french toast, eggs, potatoes, ham. Loved how the ham was thinly sliced and crispy at the edges. 
High rise pancakes- stacked with potatoes and sausages"}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast on a trip to Toronto. The service was amazingly friendly and the food was delicious. We had the lobster omelette which had big beautiful chunks of lobster and a delicious cheese sauce, the green light smoothie which was delicious and refreshing, the breakfast poutine which was delicious, savory and well balanced and  a tropical smoothie which was tasty. We checked in on yelp and it decreased our wait by a lot! It holds your spot in line while you are arriving! It definitely met our eggspectations!"}
{"text":"My friends and I used to enjoy breakfast at Cora's on Rue Catherine when we came to Montreal. Last year our favorite breakfast place was closed due to a fire. I looked on Yelp and found Eggspectation at Place des Arts was nearby by and had good reviews. We were greatly impressed with this restaurant. The options are plentiful and all sound great, the portions are generous, and the food is well- prepared and tastes great! This has become my favorite place to have breakfast in Montreal. I went there today and kept telling my cousin, \"I wish they had these in the States (US). Even if Cira reopens, I'll keep coming here instead."}
{"text":"This place was a bit hard to find but definitely worth a trip. Great breakfast spot, fresh juices and friendly service. There was a bit of a wait on a Sunday morning but the place seems to get people in and out pretty quick."}
{"text":"We noticed another location yesterday and when we were in old Montréal we decided to do late lunch here.  

It was pretty quiet so service was quick and efficient.  I tried a savory crepe and my wife chose a chicken sandwich. Both were delicious. But the star of the meal was the sweet potato fries!!

Overall quality was high and the price was really reasonable. Recommend for those looking for a sure thing good meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the French toast flambé, if you are in the mood for something sweet this plate is for you. The high rise pancakes were a yummy treat as well. The potatoes tasted fresh and the combination was on point. Everything on the menu sounded delicious! I would recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"I had eaten here last year and thought it was pretty good.  This time I was not so pleased.  The only reason why I gave it more than one star is because my companions were somewhat satisfied with their meals.
I ordered a fresh fruit plate, grapefruit juice and a coffee.  They first brought the more complicated dishes my cohorts had ordered and about five minutes later they brought my fruit.  I think maybe the reason why they took their sweet time is because they were busy getting a really long hair wrapped around several pieces of fruit.  It was nasty.  The coffee cup also had something suspicious sticking to the inside.  Yuck.  Before noticing the hair I asked the waitress, again, if she could bring me a grapefruit juice as she seemed to have completely forgotten about it.  She said \"of course\" , as if it was the first time she had heard of it and left.  She came back a few minutes later, with no juice, to ask how our meals were.  I told her about the hair and she just said \"oh sorry\" and took the plate away.  I asked her to not bring anything back as I didn't want her just to pull the hair out and give me the same plate.  After everyone finished eating and she brought the check was when she decided was a good time to bring the the juice which I did not touch since I was grossed out.  Before she took our payment she said \"sorry again\" and that was that for apologies.  I'm definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I've been to Toronto a few times, and every time I'm there I manage to come to this spot for breakfast. 

Typically I order an egg white omelette with one slice of american cheese, rye toast, and substitute out the potatoes for fresh fruit (I know, what a diva.) They happen to make this super bland meal taste delicious, and for a reasonable price.

The place fills up quickly, and you will be waiting for a table if you come late in the morning. So come early :)"}
{"text":"We ate breakfast 2 days in a row at Eggspectations on our recent trip to Montreal.  The food was good as was the service.  I eat gluten-free vegan and was able to find options on the menu.  Of course, the rest of the family found plenty of options."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Montreal! The breakfast was amazing!!! I love French toast and order it everywhere I go and this was the Best French toast I've ever had! The brioche French toast is so soft. I also thought the home fries was incredible.  They basically elevated all my favorite breakfast foods and just was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! What a find!!
Very busy when I went today,  Monday morning around 10:30am thinking I would beat the morning \"rush\". It happened to be Monday Canadian Thanksgiving Day!
Hostess said 10-15 wait but approached me a few minutes later offering me a 2-top raised table in the back. It actually turned out to be a really great table with nice view of the restaurant and outside (see first pic).
I saw buttermilk pancakes from previous Yelp write ups and was glad I asked my Server-Steve.  He recommended the French Toast with assorted fresh fruit with cream inglas and maple syrup on the side.
Food came out super fast considering how busy they were! Coffee very good and service was good/attentive. Staff seems to work as a Team!
They also offer covered and opened seating outside as well on a quiet side street.
I highly recommend Eggspectation!!"}
{"text":"Friday morning late breakfast. Busy but no line to get in. Ordered coffee and \"Benedict florentine\" assuming it would be good since their eggs Benedict is what they're supposedly known for. My husband ordered coffee and \"the Classic\". Our food arrived about 2 minutes after ordering. My eggs Benedict were cold, not even mildly warm, but ice cold, there was absolutely no melting of the cheese and the sauce was cold and too thick. Potatoes were relatively hot. Husbands poached eggs were also pretty cold. After a couple bites of the eggs Benedict to find even the centers ice cold, I flagged down the server and sent it back. My husband kept his. The server said he'd fix it. 3 minutes later, my new plate arrived. It was warm-ish this time. I ate half of the eggs Benedict and most of the potatoes. Coffee was good. It seems as though everything is pre-made, not made to order. Which is pretty sad considering it takes about 3/4 mins to soft poach an egg. We spent the rest of the day with pretty upset stomachs, too. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone. Breakfast is a hard meal to f*#* up. Save your money and go get a fresh Montreal bagel and spread some cream cheese on there! Trust me on this one, your wallet and stomach will thank you for it."}
{"text":"It's ok...definitely has a chain-vibe to it. Our server was super nice and the food arrived quickly... but exiting took a while. We had to wait for the check and then again to pay. 

The food is mediocre - potatoes were on the lukewarm side and the mix of stuff in the breakfast burrito was a bit off. The eggs were hot but the tomato jam/salsa stuff that was inside was cold...it wasn't all together. So, it's a mouthful of salsa vs. eggs. 

The toast was good and the feedback on the meat lovers omelette was less than stellar. Toast is served with lots of jams, jellies and peanut butter packets. Iced tea was so sweet that it was undrinkable. I always assume that iced tea is unsweetened by default (unless I'm in the south). So that was a bit of a waste...but I drank 2 glasses of water.

I currently have a bit of a belly ache and hope it passes quickly."}
{"text":"It's a 4 star in Toronto, but 3 star compares to modern stander dinning ... Why ?

Fresh ingredient and food source are what people should diet on. It's December almost Christmas time, why is there Melon and WaterMelon In my breakfast? Certainly...global climate change and technology can achieve that and adding an extra fruit source is \"healthy\"...but melons are summer food... NEVER EVER PUT WRONG SEASON in your plate. It's neither healthy nor fine restaurant should do.  (Unless you enjoy frozen fruit & preserved fruit) 

Bravocaado EggBenny is what I ordered, ( instead of muffin they replaced by half avocado and with tomato sauce instead holland sauce) 

Delicious yes, happy eating for people want to diet clean. However, the avocado should be heated up slight in the seed area... the layer of taste note like a water slide... \" Watery Warm on top, COLD that wake you up, then Warm again\"...

Overall: great place to hangout with large group, enjoy nice breakfast in a open space. Price is acceptable and staff are nice."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on Saturday after being recommended by our hotel. We were nicely surprised by the atmosphere and food. We had a breakfast bagel and the American breakfast. The food and service was great. The server was pleasant and very friendly. Would happily recommend this place. 
Location is also great and plenty of staff."}
{"text":"I came to Toronto with a friend of mine and really need to get some breakfast.  Everything we ordered met our expectations. We ordered a few different items and tried a little bit of eat.  The portions are pretty big and it's a good idea to share if your not a big eater. But who doesn't like breakfast foods? They have waffles, pancakes, eggs, everything a breakfast lover could dream of.

Their eggs Benedict are totally worth trying! I believe that's what they said they were famous for anyways."}
{"text":"First stop when I got to T O R O N T O. I love brunch and this place was egg-ceptionally good. I will definitely pay another visit the next time I visit Toronto again!!

I ordered the Blackstone Egg's Benedict which came with a side of potatoes and fruits. The Benedict itself came with half an English muffin, avocado, bacon, tomato, and a perfectly poached egg topped with the classic hollandaise sauce. The eggs Benedict was a 10/10 for me, I can say it's one of the best I've ever had. I wish I was able to try the other options on the menu as well but my tummy can only fit so much! The potatoes were lightly seasoned and cooked perfectly. The dish was huge in portion and way enough to fill my stomach for an afternoon brunch. I also had the sweet potato fries which were again, one of the best I've ever had. All I can say about this spot is that it was amazing. 

The ambience is great. The decors make the place really comfortable. This spot does get packed on a weekend afternoon so do expect a wait! I'm definitely coming back to try more things on this menu. Not to mention, their menu is biggggg! There are so many options ranging from pancakes/waffles, to sandwiches, to omelettes, to eggs Benny's, etc."}
{"text":"I came here on vacation for breakfast on a random day. 

I got a fresh squeezed OJ and coffee to start. The coffee is surprisingly good for any type of chain. The OJ tasted fresh, so I have no complaints. 

I went out on a limb and got the sugar shack. The crêpe was pretty good, they potatoes were good too. The only thing I didn't really care for was the beans, but I'm not a huge fan of baked beans anyways, and was glad they were served on the side. 

Service was good too. They were quick to get us in and out without rushing us. For it being in Toronto, it sure wasn't Toronto prices either."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here and would recommend it.  

The menu was huge and had a ton of options for both breakfast and lunch.  Had a bagel with egg and melted cheese on it.....awesome stuff.

The coffee was about the best that we had on our trip to the Great White North.

And the service was terrific."}
{"text":"I got the Classic Eggs Benedict with an added a side of Avocado and I have to say, it was really good. No, it wasn't the best Bene I've had, but it was solid and for the price I would say it was better than I expected. The seating was fast-food joint style with a better surrounding ambiance. Everything was clean with an open kitchen. The waitress wasn't all that cheery, but that's fine with me. If I was walking by this place looking for breakfast I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"If I could give 10, I'd definitely do it!! Our first place while visiting Old Montreal with the kids, and it satisfies all ages. Just keep in mind they close early. Great taste, and very friendly servers!"}
{"text":"They have everything you will ever want on your menu. This location is very central and although it looks small, don't let it fool you. The top section is expansive. They attract a rather large crowd since it's inside of a mall and attached to a hotel. But the wait wasn't too bad for us when we went on a Thursday and Friday morning. The selections are expansive and almost everything on the menu was delicious. Definitely had difficulties deciding on what to order. But I would definitely say try their omelets and crepes. Their coffee is great too! Smooth and strong. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a great breakfast experience in Montréal."}
