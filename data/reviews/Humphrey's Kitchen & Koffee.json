{"text":"Great place to grab lunch -- service is quick and food is good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Love the roasted vegetable sandwich - a great vegetarian option! The cashiers are always friendly, and service is pretty quick even during the inevitable lunch rush."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast! I love running in here on busy mornings to grab a breakfast burrito. They use good tortillas here! Very important. The staff are very friendly and always smiling. The place is clean and well kept, with nice decorations, too! I definitely recommend stopping by here."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I got the egg white croissant sandwich and had no chipotle cheese sauce. Bummer"}
{"text":"Humphrey's is my go to especially since it's walking distance from me. I love the ladies who work there, they are so friendly and nice. They always make my day a little better.   I've ordered numerous items from their menu and the list will continue to grow hahah. So I'll probably update this in the future.   This are the items I recommend so far:  1. BlackBerry lemonade ask for extra ice as it's super sweet and made with lemonade. I always add water as my day goes. The drink medium or large drink will last me all day pretty much.  2. Literally any of their sandwiches are delicious since the meats used are from the company, Boar's Head. Definitely quality and not your regular sandwich meat. Ask for 9 grain bread with avocado mash and you can choose the rest of the condiments accordingly.  3. Last but not least, they offer amazing lattes! I love love love their mocha latte. Now they are quite strong.The medium contains 3 shots  the large has 4 shots so be aware!  Overall, I love this little restaurant but they do get extremely busy from 11:45 am to 1 pm. There a lot of businesses around so you will see people in business attire. Only bad thing is they're closed weekends and close early. I wish I can have them more!!! But I guess that means all the hardworking ladies and men are pretty darn amazing! Located in the Camelback Commons Building - Visitor Level A."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious food! I have tried a lot of it since I work in the same building. Their sandwiches and salads are fresh and pretty good sized as well. Super nice staff and willing to customize your food if requested. Calling ahead is probably the best idea because everyone knows how good they are, so they are really busy at peak times!"}
{"text":"I come into Humphreys every day on my lunch break and it's always packed around noon! The ladies working there are so sweet and friendly. Their wraps (turkey avocado being my personal favorite) is amazing! You can also build your own sandwiches however you'd like. 5/5 stars for the food and 10/5 stars for the ladies working!"}
{"text":"I work in the building right next door and this little deli is just great!   They offer gluten free bread & breakfast along with all of their delicious lunch options which is awesome!  They have a pretty good cold brew too if you want an iced coffee fix.   Staff is also very friendly! Pricing- reasonable!"}
{"text":"A co-worker treated me with a breakfast bagel from this place and it has forever changed my life.  Never again will I stop by McDonald's for a Sausage Egg McMuffin.  Humphrey's Fried egg and sausage bagel is everything I have ever dreamed of! Not great for the waist, but definitely great for the taste-buds!!"}
{"text":"Best lunch place. I've never had a bad experience and never will. Nicest staff!! Highest quality food!! My coworkers use Humphreys as a prize for winning a contest. It's that good. Thank you for being the best and keeping us fed!"}
{"text":"This place is just the best. At the last minute my boss wanted sandwiches brought up for a meeting in our office.  I called Humphreys less than 45 minutes  before I needed to pick them up . They are the most accommodating folks! Extremely fast, meticulous when they pack the lunches, they even include little sheets of paper with who the sandwiches for. They also went out of their way to create a salad for one of our most difficult eaters. Everyone enjoyed the food. I highly recommend this place for a quick, well priced lunch"}
{"text":"I work within walking distance from Humphrey's and I can without a doubt say this is a(n office) crowd favorite. Stop by for lunch, and you'll definitely see lots of people in office-wear stopping by for a quick bite or to pick something up. It's also a favorite in my office when we have meetings over the lunch hour - a sandwich, chips, and of course, a cookie. The reuben is usually my go to, with the turkey and bacon melt coming in at a close second. Pity that they close at 2.30PM though, so make sure you take a lunch at a decent hour and make it over in time!"}
{"text":"This place is walking distance within my work so it's very convenient. Typically, you will find people in their suits or office attire. I have my meetings here sometimes.  It honestly took me three try's to like this place. The breakfast was good, but a little overwhelming and heavy for me. So I was sleepy through out my day at work. My colleagues love the breakfast scramble here. I thought it was heavy. However, it's personal preference.   My favorite would have to be the mesquite smoked turkey bacon melt. The chipotle sauce goes very well with the avocado. The toast on the bread was perfect. Not too hard, but a little harder than crispy.   Note:  -Very good spot for a quick bite on your lunch break. -the bear claw (pastry) is good.  -this place has one of the best coffee roasts I have ever had. -most of their foods are made on spot. :)"}
{"text":"Small cafe/deli with delicious sandwiches and breakfast items. Best breakfast burritos ever! Very friendly staff. Located inside Camelback Commons office building."}
{"text":"Maria, who took my phone order was very pleasant and patient answering my questions about the menu. Our breakfast order was prepared quickly and was still pipping hot when we got it home. There are plenty of yummy menu choices. We ordered breakfast burritos with chorizo. They were very good with fresh eggs and lots of cheese. I also had a raisin bagel with cream cheese and peanut butter...yummy.  I didn't pick up the order, but they offer curb-side pickup, which is fantastic.  Very yummy inexpensive breakfast in an area where meals are overpriced."}
{"text":"Love this place hidden gem!  Also one of best burgers in Phoenix!  And great service."}
{"text":"Yay!  Finally, a good deli in this building.  They serve typical deli fare -- soup, sandwiches, salads, etc., plus they also serve breakfast.  They offer a soup/half-sandwich combo, so I got a cup of the tomato basil with half of a tuna albacore sandwich on wheat.  The soup is tasty and the albacore tuna is fresh!  The bread is also good quality.  They were also giving out samples of their GYNORMOUS cookies today, so I tried a piece of the peanut butter cookie -- it was pretty good!  All in all, a great addition to the building (the Camelback Commons office building)."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch! Super friendly and quality food. I love all salads, tuna melt and chili bean soup!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place!  I work in the building next door and we are desperate for lunch places within walking distance. This place is fresh and delicious. The gals that work there are super sweet too. Thank you for opening!!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't stepped into this little gem & already I made a bad judgement. I figured it was bad food that was overpriced. I could not have been more Wrong!! This place was so delicious & their prices were great! I ordered the country scramble with a blueberry lemonade tea! Super delicious! The staff was wonderful, they were patient & offered suggestions. They offer a great seating area both inside & out. Although it may be a little hard to find, it is definitely worth the hunt.  Tip: It is on Level A within the complex!"}
