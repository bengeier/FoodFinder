{"text":"While staying in Vegas, I woke up one morning to find that my bf had picked up bagels and caffeine for breakfast.  There were about 6 different varieties in the box - I sampled all of course - and thought they were all scrumptious.  The bagels were perfectly toasted; still soft and chewy, just how I like.  He also bought 3 tubs of schmear (cream cheese spread); reduced fat, strawberry, and honey almond.  The honey almond was by far both of our favorite.

My usual fat-free latte was surprisingly pretty good.  He didn't comment on his coffee, so it must have been satisfactory.  :o)

If you're looking for yummy bagels, I would definitely recommend this place.  I myself prefer spending superfluous amounts of calories on dessert."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Worst I've ever seen. Forgot our food, low quality and nobody cares. Fault in management and employees. 

Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"The guy who took my order was really rude. It was my first time going there so I guess I didn't order quick enough or I wasn't an expert in whatever I was ordering. I wanted a mixed berry smoothie at first and the guy had the nerve to roll his eyes in my face and tell me he just didn't have yogurt or whatever to make it. Then I was like ok, I want a caramel macchiato. He mumbled something under his breath, so thinking that he couldn't make it, I started to say \"ok then I'll have something else.\" He bit back with \"NO! Do you want iced or heated?!\" I said iced. I also wanted a bagel; I looked him straight in the eyes and ordered my bagel while he was gossiping with someone else and he never gave me my bagel xS, never even processed that I had ordered something else. Not going back there again."}
{"text":"Overall good food, overall understaffed. 

Generally long waits at this location. The staff is rushed and makes mistakes due to understaffing. They have forgotten to make my order in the past. I've seen one staff member right outside the front door smoking - not very appetizing. If possible, come early or avoid this location altogether."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and the staff was very slow. By the time I got my sandwich they had made it on the wrong bagel. I didn't even bother asking for it to be fixed because it took so long."}
{"text":"The order taker was friendly and entered the correct order. There was only a couple people ahead of us. The actual cashier experience was terrible. She was the only cashier/drink maker/drink server working and the customers in front of her had to stand and wait 10+ minutes to just pay for their food!! Management is terrible if they think Sunday brunch time can be efficiently done with such little staff!! I typically love Einstein's but after this visit I don't have any urge to rush back in!"}
{"text":"Whole experience was not good. These people have no sense of urgency. They don't realize most people have work so it seems as if they are going as slow as possible. Let alone, staff seems kind of in a daze and not very friendly. Toasted bagel was also soggy and expensive."}
{"text":"Undercooked bagels?! Yes, they do. I consumed a bite and noticed my bagel wasn't cooked. Their site made lemonade tastes like they used tap water instead of purified filtered water. 

When I asked to return the items they made the process unpleasant and didn't apologize. 

Customer service and quality is lacking. Either they need to get it together or shut it down.

I will never walk in these doors again."}
{"text":"This shop is located in the large atrium at the center of the University Hospitals campus.

The few times I've gone, the staff give a forced smile and welcome you in a way that suggests they're under a lot of pressure from management. If you order from the menu, it will be formally written down on a card (even if it's not busy), as though they'll be fired for small mistakes. It's not a relaxed or friendly vibe.

Today I went with a nice BOGO coupon for any sandwich. They refused to honor it, because apparently they are not a \"participating location\". So instead I grabbed a salmon salad from the cooler and asked the girl how much since there was no sign. She said $6.79, which is only a little more than I usually pay for lunch. But when I got to the register, they charged me $8. She wasn't even close.

The salad itself was fresh and tasty, although it had 2 lemon wedges instead of dressing. Aside from the lack of dressing ,it was better than any salad I've had from EB in a couple years (I used to eat the chipotle salads on a weekly basis before they shrunk them and decreased the quality). Unfortunately the plastic clamshell container was too small, and as I ate it the contents kept spilling over the side. Salmon is better if it has not landed in my lap first.

If you want Einstein Bros, go to the Nord Hall location on the CWRU campus instead. It's not a far walk, and they're genuinely friendly. They even accepted a similar coupon from me last week even though they \"weren't supposed to\". Unfortunately their food is also overpriced, but that seems to be a symptom of EB in general."}
{"text":"This Einstein's (Sahara and Decatur) always runs out of things. On a few different occasions, my friends and I have gone there and ordered what we wanted, only to be told they didn't have the things needed to make them. Just this MORNING I went and asked for a Nutty Monkey and they didn't have the bananas needed to make that bagel. That's very maddening because you should always have the ingredients ready to go to make whatever the customer wants!! We advise people not to go to this location. Instead, drive a little bit more to the one on Flamingo and Rainbow. Thank you."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and easy going. This location is better than the o th er 3 in town. Bagels are actually chewable and they put enough cream cheese. This location is clean and they have someone cleaning often which you never see at other locations."}
{"text":"The bagels are okay, some are actually tasty.

The \"schmear\" (flavored cream cheese) is way too sweat for me.

The coffee is some of the worst I've ever drank.  Extremely watery, even the dark roast, tainted with stale flavors, and too expensive.

Their sandwiches are overpriced; thin toppings and not very satisfying.

And if it looks like you are walking towards UNLV, your car might get towed by the property owners (although I haven't seen this happen lately).

They like to put \"Darn Good\" on everything but I just say \"Darn\"."}
{"text":"I love Einstein but that was by far the WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had. No one was smiling, no one said hello and I had to ask for someone to help me. It looked like they were all forced to be there and hated their lives. My bagel with cream cheese - with no one in line - took 10 minutes to be made. I asked for my food to go, they had it placed in sit-in plates. I asked for it to be placed to go and the man helping me looked at me and said \"oh....I guess It did say to go...\" I will not be going back to that location - EVER."}
{"text":"I love Einstein's Bros, but this location was awful! 

I've never had a problem with my bagel to cream cheese ratio, but my bagel was not even covered with a thin layer. I went to ask for more and the cranky girl behind the counter said I would have to pay extra... 
Plus, there were hardly any bagels left and it was only 10am!

I'm sticking to the Trop and Koval location from now on. It's worth the drive. The workers actually crack a smile"}
{"text":"so I order a bunch of platters for a family event.

When it arrives they provide me NO cutlery/plates etc. I call them and the manager tells me this not provided with the platters. I tell them that it said on the website that it was. He said \"you tell me where on the website: At the time I was in the front of the hotel and was no where near a computer.. I went back to look at the website it says the following:


Serves up to 13
1 dozen fresh baked bagels, sliced traditional lox, capers, tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers, lemons and 2 tubs of double whipped cream cheese shmear.
**May contain nuts**
--Served with utensils, plates & napkins



DO NOT use them for any catering. BE warned.

As for taste.. They are average. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Nasty bathrooms. Whole  place needs to be cleaned. Good food but get it to go. Coffee station need cleaned also."}
{"text":"A great place to relax and start your day ...friendly staff and clean environment. ..Monday's are $6.00 buckets and their schmears are great....."}
{"text":"If you have a spare 15-20 minutes to spare then you should come here. I ordered two breakfast bagel sandwiches and waited WAY to long!  I could have ordered a steak by the time I got my two sandwiches!  This is redic!"}
{"text":"I normally go to Einstein out by Durango because it's closer to home. Some mornings I go to this location, because it's closer to work. Service here is mediocre. Food is not the same quality as the other location. There were two people working and the girl took my order and made my sandwich. The other guy was slowly refilling little cup lids, walked by while I was waiting to be rung up and he said \"she'll be right with you\" then he grabbed a small cup and got himself a coffee and went to the back to get another employee to ring me up while he was doing nothing."}
{"text":"Bagels were ok although there was barely any options to choose from. Smoothie was abit too sweet for me. They seemed to be understaffed."}
{"text":"They've seemed to have hired new staff, so my visits at this location are a lot more pleasant. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"It has good food but this location runs out of something every time I go. One time it was coffee, then yogurt, then iced tea, then bagel poppers and coffee again. (all different trips). Maybe there needs to be better management and training."}
{"text":"This specific location has extremely slow service and has repeatedly mixed-up my order. It is worth the effort to go to another location and I will never return to this one."}
{"text":"I love this place. Sometimes they don't have the bagel I want but my food is ALWAYS good from there no matter what. No five stars because the customer service does need to be worked on and my last frozen coffee I ordered had chunks of ice in it but I still frequent this location since it's right by my work. Their bagels and shmears are THE BEST!"}
{"text":"My last trip and I do mean last trip to this Einstein's I was treated to several of the staff TWERKING around the place. And the ones who were not twerking were laughing like crazy. What has happened to this place"}
{"text":"Second time in, less than a week. Staff didn't even listen to my order while talking over me.  Monday special is useless as the majority of the good bagels are \"out\". Will not come back to this location.  Bagel was also on the soggy side after toasting...wow"}
{"text":"This is a small place that gets packed because it's an awesome location!
Milenia is the BEST manager ever!! She is so warm and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Love Einsteins but do not love this location.  Employees are a bit scary and the food prep area appears dirty.  Won't come back.  Wish they could get some help."}
{"text":"Went to this einstein's on a Saturday morning and they were so unorganized and falling apart. After being first in the order line for 15 minutes they still failed to acknowledge us or any of the other waiting customers. Behind the counter it was hectic like they had never experienced a morning rush at a fast food bagel restaurant before. You could see the workers dropping bagel slices on the floor and just going around in circles. There were workers there who were just standing around not doing anything but playing with their gloves. After waiting a total of 20 minutes first in line to order we finally left and went to the Starbucks down the street."}
{"text":"Located in the weirdly not descriptive UH \"Atrium\" (which makes one think of a bright, light filled space not the dingy, under-a-bridge evocative cavern that is home to this location), EB is \"fair to middlin'\".    The bagel was not toasted well, the 'schmear was scooped into a small condiment cup and the self-serve coffee was several shades from warm.   

The staff were automaton-like and evidenced little personality, not even responding to my cheerful thank you with a grunt or other acknowledgement.  They simply look right past you and turn away when their role is complete.  

No return for me in the future."}
{"text":"Good bagels good coffee good people, enough said. I have bagels here at least twice a month and the staff is alway courteous and caring. The bagels are always fresh when I come in, and the coffee is always hot. If you're in the area stop by give him a chance. I know I will continue to come here twice a month."}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm not a fan of this location.  The food itself is pretty consistent across the franchise, and it's by no means bad.  The French Toast egg sandwich they have sometimes seasonally is a great breakfast item.  However, my low review has less to do with the food than with the service.  I have two main gripes.  

1) The service is sooooo incredibly slow.  If you're not aware, this location is right in the atrium/cafeteria of University Hospital, and it gets quite busy during the day.  Lots of hungry nurse's who only have 10 minutes to spare, patients and their families, etc.  When the lines get long, it can take the better part of a lunch break to get your food.  And even when it's not busy, you will be standing around for quite a few minutes waiting for your name to be called if you order anything more complicated than a bagel.  I don't even think it's really the staff's fault (who have never been rude to me by the way); it looks like they only have a couple tiny microwaves/toaster ovens back there.  My impression is that the facility is just not equipped to handle the volume of customers they get.  

2) I just don't understand what possible sense it makes to close this entire location on the weekends.  Why??? I mean, sure there's not as many staff members in the atrium on a weekend, but hospitals don't close- there are still patients and staff that work weekends!  Part of this might be my own personal bitterness at being stuck in the ER at night on the weekends and having no options for food except to order Jimmy Johns.  But I still feel that it's a valid point. 

At least they're open late...?"}
{"text":"I understand it's almost 2 pm, but these 2 ladies on shift right now are rude and lazy. She rang me up for a bagel they didn't having forcing me to get another one that I didn't even want. Refuse to make me the beverage I asked for just lazy. I'll never come back. It's Einstein for a reason. I should be able to get the coffee and bagels I came here for. Period"}
{"text":"I made an order to go and it was awful. I ordered 2 toasted bagel sandwiches which they forgot to toast and they were cold, 2 extra hot lattes which were not at all hot, and the sandwiches came with a fruit cup each and they forgot one. The one they did give was pathetic. See the pic. Lazy. Do not go to this place if you want quality food and service."}
{"text":"I had a pepperoni pizza on a garlic bagel. Price is a little too much for what it is but it was pretty good. Its what you would expect from a pizza bagel. The potato dalad is the bessssst. Pretty light. And the chocolate chip cookies are good when soft... Make sure you get it from in the window, not the register because its old."}
{"text":"Unfortunate there isn't an option for zero stars. I typically love Einsteins Bagels...fast, delicious, not too unhealthy and usually the staff is very friendly and competent. NOT THIS LOCATION. I went in a couple weeks ago and ordered a bagel with shmear for myself,and a bagel sandwich for my boyfriend. We were correctly rung up, a little over $10. Our order came up and we left, made it home and we had only a bagel sandwich in the bag...with the shmear for my regular bagel on my boyfriends bagel sandwich. I am not one to pay for food and not receive/eat it, especially when I'm hungry, so I drove all the way back there, and even called ahead to make sure it would be ready since I was now late for work. Upon re-arrival I was met with smug remarks and the incompetent fool behind the counter essentially telling me it was MY fault he rang up our order correctly and somehow confused himself in the \"bagel making process\" which I'm sure is not rocket science, having successfully prepared my own bagels at home for years. I left with my bagel and not so much as a \"sorry for the inconvenience\" or anything. Usually after going to a place with such obvious incompetence I refuse to go there, since it's my local Einsteins I tried again the following week. WHAT A MISTAKE. Not only was the same little dipshit behind the counter, he had the nerve to comment to his co-worker that \"I was the person he was just talking about\" GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. NOT. I do not like to be made to feel uncomfortable when I am simply trying to get a bagel! They were out of all 3 kinds of bagels I would normally get, so I left, this time I will NOT be returning unless its with new management just to watch those ignorant, future jail cell occupying, degenerates get what they deserve..a boot out the door!"}
{"text":"Being as how I had not had a sesame seed bagel in ages, I was super excited to try the toasted perfection I thought would await me at this restaurant. And while the customer service was nice, n the atmosphere created a feeling of peaceful bliss, soothing enough to enjoy the delicious delicacies of any deserving meal, I am sad to say, it did not meet my mouth's expectations. To my complete n total surprise, I bit into a barely toasted, cold hearted bagel...my orange juice needed sugar, n my cream cheese was used so sparingly ud have thought that an employee brought it in from their own home n didn't want to run out. My husband's bagelwhich was somewhat on the skimpy side, but was cooked properly, n was at least warm. All in all, however, it was not worth the 20 dollars that we spent, n the best thing there was probably the coffee, all though we could have gotten the same thing at home from our Keurig,  n at a fraction of the cost...very disappointed."}
{"text":"The people here definitely hate their job but the food is good. At 6am I don't want to talk to anyone either, I rather eat."}
{"text":"Totally agree with the other reviewers about Einstein's being overpriced. A small coffee alone costs $1.91 after tax and adding cream cheese to a bagel costs more than the bagel itself. Sure, the bagels are pretty good, but this is Mesa, not New York City.

My real beef with this place, though, is the customer service. Although there are always plenty of people behind the counter, I have waited numerous times in a line that reaches the door. On my visit this morning, I saw a customer walk in, see the line, and turn right back around. Also on my visit today, I tried using a coupon for a \"free bagel thin with light shmear.\" The picture in-store advertised the bagel thin with pink cream cheese and my kids were excited to get their bagel with strawberry cream cheese (which is also listed as one of their reduced-fat options, which means \"light,\" right?) When I ordered this, however, I was told that this was not possible because corporate is only allowing them to use ONE kind of light shmear for this promotion. Even the general manager refused to make a substitution, while watching my 3-year-old cry with disappointment (I know, it's a little thing, but come on, he's 3.) So congratulations, Einstein's at Gilbert & Baseline. You've just made a customer never want to return over your refusal to substitute 2 tablespoons of cream cheese. Do you think that's what corporate had in mind?"}
{"text":"I love coming to Einstein Bros! I'm on the UNLV campus frequently, and I always tend to forget to eat in the morning, so I like to drop by Einstein's for bagels, coffee, or if I'm feeling really hungry a breakfast sandwich!
Friendly staff and quick paced.
In addition to a variety of bagels, they have lot's of cream cheeses to pick too! They have breakfast sandwiches which I have to say top McD's breakfast sandwiches anyday!
When you order coffee its self serve. You get a cup and select what coffee you want from the side. 
This place is also a great place for a quick lunch or snack. 
If you're feeling down on fuel, do drop by Einstein's!"}
{"text":"This was my least favorite visit to this chain. Poor customer service and my simple order for a toasted bagel went like this:
I waited 5 minutes for someone to come upfront and take my order, they took the next customers order of a dozen bagels(which took almost 5 minutes to decide on), got them packed and ready to go before even putting mine into the toaster.  Won't likely return to this location ever again. 
2 stars because the everything bagel with veggie shmear is hard to screw up."}
{"text":"I have never witnessed such a disorganized restaurant ever in my life. After we had ordered our food, only until after we were told that some of what we payed for was sold out. Then, they totally forgot about one of our orders  plus when we finally got it, it was just totally covered in cream cheese. The food could be better but overall, they're not paying attention to their customers."}
{"text":"I love Einstein bagels, but the service at this location sucks.  All the workers shuffeling around like they're bored as the line grows longer and longer"}
{"text":"I, along with my colleagues, will typically have our Monday morning meetings at this Einstein location.  The place is not usually too pcaked, but they do a steady stream of business.  I almost always get the Asiago bagel with turkey and cheese to go with my medium mocha.

I have never had to wait more than a few minutes for my entire order to be made and delivered to my table.  Once a mistake was made on an order and when the waitress discovered the error, she promptly delivered my ordr, along with the purchase amount!  How's that for customer service (I'm not a dick so I let her keep it as a tip)!

Long story short, the folks are nice and honest, the food is pleasant and delivered promptly and I don't have a complaint."}
{"text":"They have a pretty good deal for half a dozen bagels with cream cheese for $7 and some change. That's breakfast for 6 people for $1+ per person or two fat people like me. The bagels are soft and tasty. I do not know for sure if they are fresh because let's face it, this is not New York City. For a chain bagel shop. I give it four STARS."}
{"text":"Last week i was disapointed about the speed of processing my order , i still came back . But what i've seen today really pissed me off! One man with dirty long hair ( maybe was not dirty was with wax , but still he sould have weared a cap) NOT wearing a cap is preparring the bagels here! I had to ask for somebody else to make ours! This is outrageous ! I've never seen something like this !"}
{"text":"I have never had a problem with the numerous amount of times I have been to Einsteins. It has been one of my life's food missions to discover the best Everything bagel. I like many varieties of bagels but the Everything bagel has always been on the top of my list and so far Einsteins has the best one. Besides their delicious bagels, they can make anything with them. Pizzas, sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, etc. It is like bagel heaven. They also have great salads (chicken is not dry) and a variety of drinks. Their apple juice and lemonade is quite thirst quenching. 

The atmosphere is great and the overall staff there is pretty decent. And who does not enjoy a place where breakfast is served all day, but you can also get lunch as well as dinner because they are open late during the week and have non-breakfast items as well. Oh, and I almost forgot about the different smears they have for those who just like a good bagel with cream cheese, onion and chive, smoked salmon for you fish lovers, garlic herb, sun-dried tomato, and my favorite, strawberry. There are more I am sure, but those are the ones that kind of stand out. I love variety! Don't you?"}
{"text":"While the food is usually decent to good, the service on the other hand- from management down -has taken an extreme nose dive for the worse! Short, rude, dismissive and all around awkward with the unintelligent approach they pass off as service. This place is purely operating on its name- Go to a different location!"}
{"text":"This einstein's is mediocre. The workers are unmotivated and SUPER slow. They nearly forgot our order. Not worth coming at all."}
{"text":"The store is clean the bagels r great Dave and James are great. Enjoyed the coffee.  Is a great security cameras.  A great place to stop turkey sausage turkey healthy."}
{"text":"Struggle bus much. I love me a good bagel from Einstein Bros, but this location has failed me miserably every time.  They are always out of something, screw something up, and for having 5 people working behind the counter, they don't seem to know how to take an order correctly or wipe a table and empty the overflowing trash. Case in point: just ate here. Ordered a breakfast sandwich and a toasted bagel with cream cheese. Rudely told they're out of ham (what else is new?). Go to pay and ask for 2 drinks, and am completely ignored. Get our food only to find out that they didn't toast the bagel, and mysteriously thought I wanted salmon on it, which they peeled off and offered me the same bagel because it was the last one. Wowza, that's some customer service. We're eating, the only people in the place now, and a guy behind the register bellows a burp that pretty much made the posters on the wall rattle. Needless to say, I didn't order that half dozen bagels to go that I wanted. Guess I'll be looking for a new bagel place in town!!!"}
{"text":"Come here often service often slow. Today was the worst. 5 people working no one even trying to keep line moving. Everyone moving in slow motion. Almost every bagel gone at 8:30. Coffee empty. Just awful."}
{"text":"We went by there today after first driving past it to a preferred place miles farther away only to find the other place closed for remodeling.  We should have just kept going.  It's so obvious the staff  and managers at this Einsteins just couldn't care less."}
{"text":"I went in and I had great customer service from Christine and Veronica! They were so polite and helped me."}
{"text":"Poor selection, worse customer service, and $16 for 2 bagels with cheese and egg and an orange juice. Go to your local grocery store and buy your own dozen.  Read similar reviews.  AVOID!!!!"}
{"text":"Good stop for Bagels and a coffee. Always clean and friendly staff . No complaints here."}
{"text":"Awful experience!! - we ordered 3 basic bagels to go and 2 out of the 3 bagels were prepared incorrectly. My bagel was untoasted even though I had very clearly asked for it to be toasted. My friend's bagel had no cheese even though it was ordered and they charged extra for it. To make matters worse, they charged $8 more which I caught after the order was rung up. This place is run by a bunch of untrained people, there were no apologies or indication that they care about customer service. Lastly the bagels are VERY expensive  so recommendation to find another place!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service! Pretty busy when we stopped in on a Saturday morning. The line moved very quickly but it took a bit for our bagels to be ready. Other than that, no complaints! Solid Einstein's location"}
{"text":"It's good for a quick bite. It's near my work so I always take advantage of their $7 bagel box (13pcs)."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  We were in Vegas for a sports tournament.  We needed a small and quick early morning breakfast.  We didn't want a big buffet breakfast because it would weigh us down for the tournament.  This place was perfect for us.  The bagels were great.  We got the farmhouse and it was plenty big and tasty.  The coffee was excellent too.  We will definitely come back here the next time we are in town and need a good morning bite to eat before a tournament."}
{"text":"Don't call ahead, especially if you're in a hurry! I called in the girl who answer the phone seemed like she just didn't care. I ordered FOUR sandwiches, we get there to pick up the food. I pay and we just waited 10 minutes I finally had to ask about our food, only to find out it was sitting there, she didn't tell the people cooking we were there. When we got the bag, there were only THREE sandwiches. The gentleman checked the order, and the girl only rang up three paid $25 for three sandwiches seems a little high. Of course I didn't want the receipt because we've never had an issue (but I've never called in my order before). This establishment really needs to train in call in orders, including reviewing the order since when I ended the call I said FOUR sandwiches. Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here over the weekend. I had the southwest egg whites and turkey sausage breakfast sandwich and my husband had the ham, eggs and Swiss breakfast sandwich. We both loved out sandwiches. Then we ordered their mixed berry smoothie and it was delicious I loved that the worker gave us a little bit extra because she made too much!  we will be back!"}
{"text":"We come from Hawaii and my dad wanted 3 cinnamon sugar bagels and 3 blueberry bagels to bring home. Einstein must be a oxymoron name because they gave him 6 blueberry.  He was so disappointed. We are already back home so we couldn't do anything but it wasn't a complicated order. SMH."}
{"text":"After far too long spent in the post office across the car park from here bagels sounded like the perfect solution to ending the ever growing louder grumbles emanating from our stomachs.

It was quiet inside but there were still a couple of people waiting around for their orders. There looked to be plenty on offer but the ever-trusty combination of bacon and egg won me over. My wife picked something else, but her being a vegetarian it did not have bacon in it and therefore was of no concern to me and I promptly forgot what it was. While ordering my eyes wandered over the assorted delicious looking treats on offer and without even thinking about it a container of pumpkin bagel poppers somehow ended up on the counter before me. 

The wait for our food seemed to be quite long, which I hoped meant that the bacon and egg going into my bagel, and shortly my stomach, was going to be fresh. Once we got our bagels they were quite delicious and filled the bagel-sized holes in our stomachs nicely. The pumpkin poppers were quite good too, a little sweet and sticky, but worthy of going back for more.

I'll probably never be in the same area as here again, it's a little far to travel to the post office here again from Australia, but just in case that does happen I'll head back here for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by in between classes. 

I'm a huge sucker for bagels and pretzels. I almost cried happy tears when I saw they had pretzel bagels. A combination from culinary heaven! Bagels aside, they've got good free Refill coffee, the people that work here are nice, and it's quick. 

If you're an avid bagel-er, theyve got punch cards for you."}
{"text":"Wow so the employees are lazy and closed the store 20 min early. Why have business hours if you can't even honor it. Wouldn't be the first time"}
{"text":"Our first time here was not a very good first impression.  I ordered my favorite bagel with lox and capers . When I bit into my bagel I felt a weird texture, they didn't take the paper off the salmon ! I had already swallowed what was in my mouth ! I took my bagel up to the front after explaining what happened the girl making the bagels looked at me and sarcastically said sorry.  They both stared at me for a second then took my bagel from me and made me a brand new one. Too bad this happened on our first time."}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible, no selection, prep table was disgusting. Was waiting for food and witnessed one of the male workers cough into his hands didn't wash his hands after wards, later then witnessed the same man use the restroom came out seconds later readjusting his pants, logically thinking if he peed he didn't wash his hands after that as well. Wouldn't recommend this location at all. Also just witnessed the lady switching the trash without gloves and she also failed to wash her hands after wards."}
{"text":"I have to show some love to this Einstein Bros' location for being open on the eve of a major holiday. Like the friendly employees here, I'd rather be at home resting with family or something, but they're real troopers. 
As I already mentioned, they're super friendly. It was just great seeing a smiling face to put me in a good mood before heading to work myself. Appreciate them already figuring that I'd want the bagels sliced for my baker's dozen too. 
Can't really dispute the quality of the bagels either 'cause they make 'em decent as expected, nor the price of the bagels, which is why it's a go-to for me when I need to feed my student-workers."}
{"text":"We enjoy going to this location ! Fast ..curtious service.Great bagels! The only thing I would ask for them to improve ..is the ladies restroom could be updated and cleaned up a bit."}
{"text":"This place is very nice, I come here once a week for a YouTube meet up and hang out. The staff is super sweet and they have really great recommendations if you don't know what to order which I didn't, i ended up getting a turkey sausage and egg on an Asiago bagel which she recommended which was delicious! Also if you sign up for their rewards program they send amazing coupons for example I had a buy 1 get 1 so I gave a sandwich to a friend that day as well and also got the molten lava cookie which was also good but could be better if warmed up in my personal opinion but it was all under $10 with the coupon! The only reason this doesn't have 5 stars is because it is absolutely freezing in there and it's not just me saying it a lot of people bring jackets and I had to leave early because my service dog was shivering otherwise great place."}
{"text":"Awful costumer service!!! I felt like I was being rushed even though there weren't any people behind me. I'm assuming the woman who \"assisted\" me was a manger because she was the only one I saw in a red shirt. But she needs a course on costumer service. She was very short and acted as if I was wasting her time. I don't care how badly we want bagels we will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Just leaving this location... And honestly my sandwich was simply amazing, I ordered the tuna on a everything bagel and it was everything! BUT Can I sit at a clean table? Can someone PLEASE sweep or even wipe off the tea machine, the coffee station, or how about you just clean period! It was gross... Nothing was clean my daughter said mom lets cancel our order... Which we probably should have because she barley ate! her order was wrong and now I'm on my way to a drive thru to hold her over till dinner.... Long story short Mr Einstein employees just because it's Sunday doesn't mean that you can slack and not keep the store up! I'll go back to another location but not this one!! Hoping that my amazing tuna sandwich doesn't make me sick!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to grab a quick breakfast on the go. They have all different combinations of bagels....my favorites are the cinnamon sugar, asaigo, and chocolate chip. They have great specials if you participate in the schmear club (you can sign up online for these benefits). And they have a bunch of different kinds of cream cheese.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hey don't greet you or ask you to wait to be served. Then you wait forever in line to place an order(even when there isn't a line). This is the 4th time this has happened here. Won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"My opinion of this chain keep dropping-seems like every time I visit one the wait is just really long,whether it be the wait to place your order (this is usually the case) or the wait to get your food.
This location of some reason, smells like farts and really bad. Inside and out. I had to leave to regain my appetite. My daughter kept making fart jokes because of it, which was amusing.
Seems like the prices keep going up too,at all of these.
I guess the two redeeming qualities was the service and the quality are still good."}
{"text":"The pumpkin walnut bagel is amazing.  I'm going to be sad when they stop serving it when the season is over.  I wish they had more tea options.  I don't understand why they don't offer regular hot unsweetened green tea.  The atmosphere is always nice and it is always seems to be kept clean."}
{"text":"Got a coffee and bagel to go. Bagel was disgusting, I just about vomited. A lox bagel should be fresh; it was old and tasted like vinegar. If you go here, only go for the coffee. I wish I had listened to the other reviews"}
{"text":"Einstein Brothers Bagels.  A national, quasi-fast-food chain.  Not usually anything special, unlike the little-known, neighborhood gems that Yelp excels at helping one find.  

This one is pretty good.  The seating area is less cramped than many other Einstin Bros establishments I have visited.  Service is generally friendly, speed is decent, though I confess I have not been here when they were jammed with customers.  

A few oddities about this location: when you enter the door, there is a big sign hanging over the counter that says \"Order Here.\"  You should ignore it, and go to the OTHER end of the counter where it says \"Pay Here\" to both place your order and pay for it.  I don't know why they chose to deviate from standard Einstein Bros protocol, but you'll thank me when you are not wasting your time at the \"Order Here\" end until someone shouts at you from behind the counter to go to the other end.  

Also unlike most EB's, rather than calling out your name when your order is ready, they will actually come out to the seating area and find you.  A nice touch.  

Food is the usual quality at an Einstein Bros, which is to say: good.  I'm not convinced they have the \"best bagels in Vegas\" as another reviewer is, but I have never been let down.

All in all, a good place for a reasonably-priced breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Consistent and staff is always friendly. Love the new \"toppers\" menu addition. I had the veggie topper and salsa schmear with jalapeño and they were both was great. Their coffee is good too."}
{"text":"I've been on a sesame bagel kick these days. I went into this location yesterday, very busy morning crowd. Waited to order, waited to pay, but expected that seeing how busy it was. There was one woman who needed help out with her order which took up five big paper bags. So even though my order was as simple as could be, which was one sesame bagel sliced, not even toasted, to go, I forgave the long wait and decided to try them again. Because their bagels are awesome.

I went there this morning. Yes, I wanted another one! Decided to see if the service was any better. It was later in the day, so when I walked in, there was only one customer at register to order, only one waiting for their food. I ordered two bagels this time (preparing for tomorrow's craving), only sliced to go. I was excited that a batch of them just came out of the oven, fresh and warm! There was four employees behind the counter, yet it just seem like they were moving, yet not being efficient. One of them acknowledged me, said they'd be right with me, then I waited about 5 minutes. Hmmmm. I paid, and my bagels were handed to me almost immediately.

As I was opening my bag of bagels when i returned home, I was thinking that experience was much better. However, as I looked down at my bagels, which did smell toasty and fresh, I saw that they must have manually sliced them, instead of using that automatic bagel-slicer thing-a-ma-jiggy that cuts it almost perfectly. Not sure if it was because it was fresh, but my bagels were flat as the wall. It could've been the bagel thins they were selling. Not cool...

I'm only giving it 2 stars because they taste so good. As flat as they had become. Not sure if it's just this location, but I'll definitely be trying a different one. If that..."}
{"text":"I was pleased with my visit to Einstein Bros. I ordered a turkey, bacon and avocado sandwich on a garlic bagel with an iced coffee with white chocolate mocha on the side. (I originally wanted an iced white chocolate mocha latte, but the machine was broken, which is one of the reasons why I'm giving this establishment a 4/5 stars.)

I got my sandwich really quick and devoured it in 3 minutes---it was that good. The garlic bagel was my favorite part; I honestly would've eaten the bagel by itself with no shmear, it was that good. ¯\_(?)_/¯ One thing that I would've changed though is asking them to toast the bagel a little longer, other than that, its a sandwich I would recommend.

The other reason why I'm giving this Einstein Bros a 4/5 is sucky hours. They close at 5PM and I got there at 4PM and still felt a little rush."}
{"text":"Went there today to get a bagel box... They were out of most bagels (at 10:30 a.m.) so I walked away with a pretty sad selection in the bagel box... It was kind of embarrassing. The staff was super friendly but the over all experience was ruined by the lack of selection and the fact that the restrooms are filthy. Seriously, the bathroom was disgusting."}
{"text":"This store SUCKS! DO NOT GO HERE!

In the last month, we have walked in, and immediately walked out as the NEVER have bagels.  There were 4 kinds there today, if that.  I actually had to ask if they made bagels there.  The customer service sucks even more than the selection.  I have almost jumped over the counter on a few occasions.

We keep going there like idiots, and end up having to go to a different EB on Val Vista.  That one is GREAT!

When we went into the Val Vista one today, we talked about how horrible the other store is, and almost every employee has said that they hear about how bad the Gilbert store is all the time.  Then, another customer overheard us and she said she lives right next to the Gilbert store and still has to drive to Val Vista one because of how bad this one is.  She mentioned that she even complained to a Regional Manager.  so she was nice enough to give me his info.

BOTTOM LINE.  If you like Einstein's Bagels, DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE.  They say they make bagels, but they don't.  The employees are rude, inconsiderate and could care less what you think.

DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Stopped in around 11:30am hoping to eat some yummy bagels! It had been a while since I had eaten here and I always remember having a pleasure experience. 

There were about 5 different employees working and no one seemed to care that we walked in. No hello, no nothing, nada. We walked on over to the order counter and the man working it just looked at us. We awkwardly  made eye contact..

I said hello first, of course, and then placed our orders.

One turkey bacon sandwich on a garlic bagel 
One ham, egg, and cheese sandwich on an Asiago bagel
One everything bagel with plain cheese

They were out of a ton of bagels and so we opted for the choices that we ended up getting. 

The blackberry lemonade is delicious!!!! My total came out to be about $16 since I did have a coupon for one free bagel with the smear. 

It was crazy to see that they were out of so many bagels so early in the day, since they do close at 4. The employees all looked miserable, no friendliness here...

Definitely not the same happy experience I remember receiving."}
{"text":"Service isn't great. Glad I sat down to eat cause I had to send my Chorizo Egg Sandwhich back twice. First time it was the wrong bagle. Second time they didn't but the avocado on it (and it comes with the sandwich). They also tried to give my friend the wrong order. So she had to sends hers back. 

Wss good once it actually got to my table correct."}
{"text":"Closed sign was still lit this morning at 5:45. The open at 5. If I was the owner, I'd be displeased. I told the girl who took my order, and she mumbled that they'd fix it, without looking me in the eye. The last three times I've been here, my order has been wrong. It's not complicated, either. Spinach and bacon, no bacon. I sit here now eating a sandwich with no bacon AND no spinach. She even repeated the order back to me. Last time, it was no sauce. Time before that, same thing. If you can't get ONE sandwich right, I don't know what to say. I'm annoyed and saddened at the aptitude of these employees. I'm done with this place. There's a Panera on baseline and Val vista. Going forward, im going there. I wish they'd just close this einsteins and put something else in this location. It's prime real estate for an establishment with two stars."}
{"text":"Some interesting characters who work here for sure. Just keep an eye out on how they prepare your order. If you stand on the left side (by the condiments) you'll have a decent view of this. I ordered two toasted bagels with cream cheese, orange juice and a coffee. Everything seemed fine and well prepared, except for the coffee. The coffee there was terrible! They're coffee pots sit where the condiments are, and all 4 or 5 of the pots (different blends) tasted like hot dish water. However, it looked like coffee, but then when you put cream in the cup, it turned into apple juice. 

That gives you the direct indication that who ever prepared the coffee, did not put enough coffee grounds in the filter. Not a big deal to just ask them to brew a new pot, but it becomes annoying and frustrating when you're in a hurry like I was. 

They receive a high volume of college kids every day since it's right across from UNLV. And because of the high volume, this explains that the quality of their items may slip from time to time. They're fault or not, just go to a different Einstein's for better coffee. Or better yet, Starbucks. (Always a good makeup)"}
{"text":"It was my first time coming to this location the place is really dirty trash all over the floor the counter tops we dirty also. None of the employees even bothered to greet us. Most of the employees looked all sloppy their appearance is not sanitary clothes all dirty. They just lost my business"}
{"text":"I've been in here less than a handful of times  and both the service and my order are less than acceptable. Today I watched customer after customer complain that their order was incorrect, which of course, included mine. This seems to be a recurring issue every time I'm here so I can definitely say it will be the last time."}
{"text":"Don't come here in the morning if you want anything special and you are in a hurry.  Hire some help that might work."}
{"text":"Einstein's redeemed itself this morning!! I feel like it can be hit our miss if they have their act together. Today they had grab and go bagels ready, they were quick friendly and awesome! Please keep people like who were working this morning. Because of these ladies I'll be back more often!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for their delicious hazelnut coffee. You can bring in your own coffee container and get a discounted refill. You save money and the environment, cool! I happened to get a $2 off Tuesday's coupon Monday, so next thing I know I'm sitting enjoying my turkey cheese egg bagel outside in the veranda. Nice way to start my Tuesday :) :) happy girlie over here."}
{"text":"Today's a great day to pop in here for a QUICK bite!

+ The variety is on point.
+ The service is quick
+ The staffs are almost welcoming
+ The place is ALMOST clean. 
I know, I know, **we customers bus our own table** We do, but not all.

Nonetheless, we appreciate this place."}
{"text":"Today was probably my 8th visit and today I was going to complain after not posting anything about my 7 other no nonsense fast service, friendly engaging staff, clean and welcoming ambience. No today I was just going to keyboard c owboy and leave 1 star.....then probably go back tomorrow. I thought how childish. This is what the looking down on the phone has brought all of us. Was the bagel good today? YES! Was the coffee on point today? YES! Was there a problem today... well yeah but the young lady working at the order counter with highlighted blonde hair look at me and saw my frustration and in a professional clear considerate manner addressed and defused my angst. Yes I will be back again and again. We all have good and bad days. We as consumers need to remember even businesses have good and bad days.  Thanks Einstein be back SOON!"}
{"text":"I love your open-faced Signature Turkey sandwich, Turkey Sausage & Cheddar Egg Sandwich, and Strawberries & Creme Smoothie, but why oh why are you sssooo expensive? You wonder why you rarely have people in here- it's because you charge $8 for a bagel sandwich with meat and some veggies inside. And you have Jack in the Box, KFC, Taco Bell and Starbucks all within the same shopping area as you for breakfast/lunch competition. 

Note: This place is identical to Noah's (a overpriced sandwich place) that is in California (where I'm from). You will see a lot of similar (if not the same things) at both places."}
{"text":"I don't complain much but today I had an unpleasant experience here for the 3rd and final time. I give everyone and second chance because shit happens. Busy, short staffed etc.... Today I entered and was greeted well. That's it. My order was taken by a very kind lady(Sorry don't remember her name. Should be employee of the year). Paying to a very monotone guy made me almost depressed. Then I watched about 6 people get there order before I did. Breakfast sandwiches can take time and I do realize there can be easier orders to get out quick. When I finally inquired about my order it was sitting on top of the microwave and I was then told I was called multiple times. Now I also understand having my son there could have been a distraction and I could've missed my name but not multiple times. I also never saw the woman step outside to look for me either. Is that her responsibility I'm not sure but when an order is filled and the person doesn't respond maybe the next time you fill another order you should probably call the order that hasn't been picked up. My son also decided to get a half dozen while we waited I went up to pay to the same dull tired guy and he never said a word. It's a shame because they have a good menu. I'm not a big complainer but this one just got to me"}
{"text":"I am a coffee snob and there is nothing wrong with that.  No five because yesterday they were out of half and half and decaf and took forever with order but usually they are great substitute if I run out if my own beans at home.  Have dog treats too!"}
{"text":"this location needs to take some training courses on customer service! the only thing keeping me coming here is the fact that there's no other einstiens near by"}
{"text":"Is  there a reason Einsteins employees don't speak English? Is Einstein's a Mexican company?"}
{"text":"Terrible ingress and egress. No parking. Service slow. I won't be back here. Had to leave to find another."}
{"text":"My coworker raved about this place so we headed over here for a quick lunch.  It took forever to get our food and when we got back to the office with it, almost everyone's order was wrong.  I ordered a turkey sandwich on an asiago bagel - it was alright.  The bagel was super greasy and the sandwich wasn't anything to write home about.  The potato salad was the highlight of the meal and even then, I wasn't impressed.  Yes - lunch was cheap but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"My experiences here have always been great, but I might be biased because I only ever come in the morning's before school when it's usually the same group of people working. Service is fast and friendly, they always tell people to have a good day or ask the regulars how work is going. A lot of the work regulars call in their orders ahead to have orders ready when they walk in. They regularly email a \"20% off Entire Purchase\" or BOGO sandwich coupons. Easy peasy morning stop :)"}
{"text":"Great choice of bagels and spread flavors along with good coffee. Drinks, including iced and hot coffee refills, are free. Right across the street from UNLV so I assume it's probably very busy during the semester. I recently went during the day on summer break so the restaurant was pretty empty. Service was fast. My only compliant is the price point for the amount of food you get for lunch. Other than that excellent quick lunch place."}
{"text":"Huge variety of bagels that are baked every 4 hours. So many choices of cream cheeses or schmears. The selection of breakfast bagel sandwiches are delightful too. If I lived here, I would definitely use their catering of breakfast or lunch offerings. Great coffee as well as specialty lattes. We always make it a point to come each time we visit."}
{"text":"this is by far the slowest Einstein Bagels in vegas. Omg!! I hate that I live so close to it. Takes 45 mins to make 1 bagel w/cream cheese with noone in line or waiting for food. If you have no patience dont come here. I'm in disbelief. How slow it is here."}
{"text":"They didn't take the wax paper off my cheese before they melted it. I ended up chewing it before I noticed. Pulled the other half of my sandwich apart to find more. Even after pulling it out it all tasted like wax. When I brought this to the employees' attention I just got weird looks and 'what do you want us to do about it,' 'It's still good.' No it tastes like wax, and I had to pull it all into pieces. I didn't even a \"oops sorry.\" I just threw it out."}
{"text":"After everything that has happened for the last few days, this was one of the first places my coworker wanted to visit after we got our rental car.

This was a nice place to unwind after the hustle and bustle of being on the strip for most of the week during my time at a conference. Bagels are absolutely delicious and quite cheap. The different spreads (known as schmears) they have for their bagels are also very varied, and delicious.

Unfortunately, for most of the conference I was very sick and was constantly hacking a lung. So I reached for a strawberry lemonade to help wake me up and soothe my throat, not knowing how much it was, and expecting to pay quite a bit. But nope! About $2, which is even cheaper than back home.

Also customer service was very friendly, even though there was a bit of a misunderstanding.

Nice and quiet (with the exception of me coughing. Sorry, everyone.) and perfect for a quick sit down snack or light meal."}
{"text":"they don't know how to cut bagels in half.  always thick on one side and paper thin on the other."}
{"text":"Only got 1 star because I had to give one. The service was terrible! I waited 5 minutes just to be acknowledged at the front of the line. For a time when it wasn't busy. Completely ignored. I continued to wait 7 more minutes for a plain bagel with cream cheese."}
{"text":"Einstein Bagels is a nice place to go and get a quick breakfast.  They have great bagels and sandwich's to choose from.  It was my first time coming to Einstein's.  

The atmosphere was great and they had free Wi-Fi, also the staff that was working that morning where really friendly and helpful.  I had the southwest Turkey-Sausage Egg White sandwich and it was pretty good and spicy too.  

If you are ever in Vegas and looking for a place to eat that is not to expansive you should head over to Einstein Bros.  It is just a couple of miles off the strip."}
{"text":"A solid place to grab a quick lunch, drink, or snack in between classes.  This Einsteins is located inside the Science and Engineering building, right across from Ham Hall, and is reasonably quiet (at least whenever I've visited).  Service is usually good, from what I've experienced.

The con: they're usually out of whole wheat bagel thins!  Come early to snag one."}
{"text":"I arrived today placed my order for two bagels and a coffee.  Waited in line forever my order was finished before cashier could ring up.
First of all a  cashier should not require to make coffee, when their is,a line of people.
Yoyr manager was not very friendly and should of had more help in the morning when it is busy.
I blame the manager because the poor girl needed help."}
{"text":"I love all the sandwiches and all the bagels here. The staff is always friendly whenever I come."}
{"text":"5 minute walk from my office on campus.
Low-calorie options that are filling!
Super nice older gentleman behind the counter who is liberal with the compliments.  ;)
Cookies.....
Doesn't break the bank.

Closes early on Fridays.  :("}
{"text":"Very unorganized. Horrible customer service. Workers talking about how much they hate working here. No communication. I asked for what the local favorite on the menu was and she said bacon and cheddar sandwich so I ordered that. After telling them three times I don't care what type of bagel they use just pick one. It was just stupid and the employees hate it and it shows badly. Need new management or some thing. My sandwich had no favor didn't taste good. I will not ever be returning to an Einstein Bros. again. Listen to the bad reviews. They are true for this place!"}
{"text":"Came in an hour before they were closing, which means they were breaking down to go into cleaning mode. I wanted to try something besides my usuals, so i winged an order for a pastrami sandwich that comes in bagel form. Lady at register had no patience. As I was trying to decide on which bagel to have my sandwich in, she was tapping her pen abruptly, perhaps out of impatience? Zero smiles are a minus one star. she repeated my order 3 times after i gave it to her. listening skills, not so delightful. 

what made up for that bad experience was the other lady who dropped off my order with a genuine smile and \"have a nice day\" and the delicious preparation of my meal."}
{"text":"I love their bagels. Don't like their coffees because Starbucks is better but they have really good bagels and smoothies."}
{"text":"FROZEN BAGELS!!!!!

Their \"baker\" comes in every morning at 4:45 and pulls the frozen bagels out of a box, puts them on several trays on a rack, and wheels the rack into the oven. 

This is not what real bagels taste like. Seriously, I'd rather eat Lender's from the grocery store. At least they're not posing as fresh."}
{"text":"Went in when it wasnt busy. Ordered one bagel sandwich. Just one. I saw them starting to make it. Im sitting there for about 20 minutes assuming they had to make eggs or bacon. That was fine until one of the workers asked if I ordered something. Im like huh? They are lookimg at the screen scratching their heads on who missed the order. I can hear the two ladies making my sandwich mumbling.. haha he looks mad. Duhhh. I kinda am now. Customer service is non existent here and its obvious the people working here hate their jobs. It was obvious after watching them hurry up and slap my sandwich together."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 15 years and am DONE!  In the past few months they have been consistently out of bagels - how is this possible when it's a BAGEL shop? I was here a few weeks ago and they were out of almost everything.  Today I went in at 10:30 and ordered my favorite sesame. Out. Ok, how about a garlic? Out. How about 6 cheese? Out. Ok, what about onion. Out. I asked \"Dont you have any of those in the back?\" Nope. Apparently this is the new norm. I will NEVER eat at this location again."}
{"text":"I've reviewed the Einsteins on Lake Mead so there's not a whole lot more to say about the food because, hey, the menus are identical. 

I will comment on the fact that this location is always WAY less crowded than their Summerlin locations. We eat at the Lake Mead location weekly and stopped by here last weekend and the place was DEAD. On a Saturday morning! 

They're only getting 3 stars because they were out of my shmear! How dare they? On a Saturday morning? You've got to be kidding!

But, I have to give Einstein's credit for their incredible low cal menu. They make killer egg white/bagel sandwiches for under 400 calories! I pretty regularly get the bacon and cheese or turkey sausage and salsa and they're pretty filling, delicious, and healthy. The sandwich is actually egg whites (or BLT, turkey, tuna, chicken)  on a \"bagel thin\" which come in plain, wheat, everything and oatmeal."}
{"text":"Both times I've eaten here the staff took an eternity to make my bagel. The food wasn't enjoyable.
Don't go here if you have a break during class; you won't make it back in time and the packaging they use for your order is ridiculously loud and crinkly.
The morning ladies don't care at all and it shows."}
{"text":"Thanks for hooking it up with lots of \"cold\" bacon. Overall sanwhich is cold.. Cheese isn't even melted. And it was slow in there....
I usually love Einstein's.. But this ... Wa wa waa"}
{"text":"I love their bagels and sandwiches. This place can be a hit and miss with service. They at times can be really slow, maybe some organizational training would help."}
{"text":"They have bagels & blandwiches...someone pass the rooster sauce!  Stale, flavorless, dry overpriced  bagels.  Weak \"shmears\" as well...they need to double or triple the portion size of the \"shmear.\"  

What really pisses me off is whenever I leave, my clothes reek of the place for the rest of the day...I don't get it?  I actually use to like Einstein Bros years ago, now they are dead to me."}
{"text":"Easy to get to, near the strip and next to the university.  Plenty of parking and helpful staff."}
{"text":"I have not been here for a couple of years,nothings changed.Lousy service.Employees have an attitude.Its dirty.The bagels aint great.Great Buns bagels make Einsteins look sick."}
{"text":"I didn't receive proper service. The person who was helping me was somewhat rude and had a \"what are you doing here\" face. I could tell he didn't want to be there and I'm not sure if he was treating every one else the same way, but I just wanted to get out of there because I felt that I was an inconvenience to him."}
{"text":"The famous Einsteins with the yummy soft bagels! However, I don't like the fact that they charge $1.50 for Cream Cheese....seriously?"}
{"text":"Came in for my free egg sandwich for my birthday. Staff is great but the eggs left something to be desired will stick to bagel and a shmear next time."}
{"text":"Ordered one bagel @ 10:07am.   Didn't get my 1 friggin bagel until 10:23am.  (Ughhhhhh) WTF.  wasn't busy at all.   aside from the extremely slow service. The asiago bagel with garden Shmear was a thumbs up."}
{"text":"I've been to this Einstein's a few times, since we live right down the road. But after today, I won't be going to this location anymore. Place was pretty dirty and disorganized, and they were out of 2 of the carafes of coffee. I waited 10 minutes, then asked one of the employees at the register if they have more Vanilla Hazelnut coffee. She told me they were brewing it right now and it will take a few minutes. Ok, understandable. Then 10 minutes later another customer asked if they had the Vanilla Hazelnut. Then the employee yells over to another employee, \"Are you brewing coffee?\" Uh, no. So she goes over to brew coffee, and says it will be another 10 minutes. Not only rude to lie to me about it, but also looks like these employees are just plain lazy. What a shame."}
{"text":"Even though the food was...ok, I am giving it 1 start because of the terrible and rude service I received...on my birthday!! I ordered a turkey wrap, and I wanted the tortilla and the turkey to be warm, shouldn't be so difficult right? Well, what I got was a somewhat warm turkey and a cold tortilla. When I went to the girl who made my wrap she gave me the worse rude attitude ever. She actually raised up her voice and told me that if she warmed up the tortilla it would make the vegetables \"disgusting\" and then she walked away, he name was Krista. Krista must be the worse employee with no brains ever. It's not rocket science to warm up the turkey and tortilla, then add the cold vegetables after. I DO NOT recommend this place because of their horrible customer service. I had such a bad experience I felt the need to write to management, hopefully they do something about it because it is employees like Krista that give this restaurant a bad name."}
{"text":"I was there at Einstein's this morning 12/1/17 and was just surprised at want i seen and heard with employee sandra, she was yelling at 2 employees in front of full store of customers. That was very unprofessional! We as customers had to wait until she was done yelling so they can get our orders. This is not the first time i have seen this person acting like this. Very bad customer service too."}
{"text":"Ok, so I love Einstein's in general but THIS location is AWFUL.  They ALWAYS run out of poppy and pretzel bagels on the daily!  You're a BAGEL SHOP.  You shouldn't run out of your most popular bagels!  Plus, there's a customer who is in there every single day who has MUTANT body odor which makes the dining experience oh, so lovely..."}
{"text":"The bagels are pure love. Lunch paninis are amazing too. They even have doggie bagels. How cute! You can also get a bucket of bagels for the office - make sure to get a schmear or two."}
{"text":"Food great and fresh. Contrary to past reviews customer service was good. 
Will visit again"}
{"text":"No lines. Quick friendly service. Two bagel sandwich and a coffee $ 11.70
Like McDonalds or Starbucks, you know what you're getting when you walk in."}
{"text":"If I was given the option of giving them 0 stars I would. Very unprofessional and disgusting. Seems like management never does anything when there is a problem or when its reported ... and I mean NEVER.

The bagel was overall dry, I noticed they didn't even bother washing their hands after handling money or touching their phones, very disgusting. How would you like to order a bagel with extra germs?

Some employees seem like they are too busy deciding what they are going to do during the weekend, Jordan and Shalinda are horrible employees and spend all their precious time on the phone making calls and texting instead of handling business and taking care of their customers.

Seems like the most important job here is making a beer run to the liquor store."}
{"text":"The service here is just terrible... 

But the specialty bagels are so tasty! I'd recommend the Santa Fe... perhaps at a different location with nicer staff."}
{"text":"If I could give this Einstein bagel 0 stars I would. I have been in here twice and both times they had very little selections for bagels. The second time I went was during prime breakfast hours and they still did not have the items I wanted. When I left one of the workers very sarcastically said \"have a great day\". When I turned around as I was leaving her and one of the other workers were smiling and laughing at me. This one is VERY close to where I live but I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on...."}
{"text":"I'm kowtowing to the corporate oppressor and I'm just going to say it:  I have never had a bagel as good as one from Einstein's.  I wish I could say some independent deli had some amazing bagels that are comparable nowhere else, but I can't.  In my limited scope, Einstein's wins.

I'm a bagel purist.  I'll try all the different kinds, but a plain bagel with plain cream cheese will win with me every time and they do it best.  The bagels are slightly crispy yet chewy and the cream cheese is almost fluffy.  They are so good!  I love their asiago and garlic bagels as well, although my coworkers don't appreciate when I've had the latter as much as I do.

Their sandwiches rule, too.  I really like almost anything on challah, and their grilled cheese panini is deeee-lish.

Their salads, eh.  I'd stay away.  But, seriously, they don't advertise that that's what they do so I give them some leeway on that.

I love Einstein's.  I can't help it.  I'll go buy a briefcase now."}
{"text":"Eww it's so dirty and gross.  The seats are ripped and duct taped together and the walls have hand print stains and food stains all over.  The employees couldn't care less either.  The centennial location is MUCH better but this one is not good!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years, and when I changed jobs, my route to work changed, so I haven't been there for almost a year. A few weeks ago, I called in a day ahead for 2 dozen pre-selected bagels, shmears, and coffee. I even called back to make a change and Tiffany was really sweet when I apologized for having to call back. When I stopped by the next day on Saturday, my order was ready and correct - and everyone was very friendly.  I just went back today with a coupon I got in my email, and yes, it took a little longer than the last time, but more than reasonable considering the volume. I think it was Emily who helped me, and even when the coupon I printed wouldn't scan, she kept her cool and got it taken care of, all the while still being sweet and smiling.  This isn't a boutique bagel shop where the ratio of workers to customers is 2:1 or anything like that!  This is high volume, and must be stressful to manage and work in. Is it perfect? No, but for what kind of business it is, I have to give them 5 stars for their hard work and friendliness despite many customers who expect things in under 5 mins and for everyone to act like they're working in Disneyland.  It's not realistic. I'm not downplaying that people might not have had poor experiences, but if you haven't worked in high volume retail or food service settings, you don't know what it's actually like to be that person trying to multi-task while maintaining health code standards, customer service standards, and corporate expectations, all while making not-so-awesome wages. So please, take a moment to take a breathe in and out before being so quick to judge a few mins of a stop on your way to a much longer work, errand, or activity."}
{"text":"Good lord. Girl barely speaks English. Cashier looks like she's been up for a week. All I asked was which sandwich was most popular and she could not understand. Didn't have my order when I went to pay. WOW"}
{"text":"Amazing bagels! If it weren't for the awful service, I would be more inclined to rate with a 4 star.

Menu:
They have a pretty wide variety of flavors that can come in bagels, sandwiches or their smears. Depending on what you get, a bagel can be as low as 2 dollars or upward to 5. 5 or more dollars for a bagel is pretty weird to me but they are delicious! What I decided to get was 2 bagels (Sesame Seed & French Toast) and 2 smears (original & honey almond). The sesame seed wasn't as impressive but the french toast bagel was so freaking tasty! Once I paired that with the honey almond smear, something changed my entire mood about the place. What was this mood? It was irritation from the service.

Service:
Granted, not every employee was horrible, but the ones at the registers definitely were! First of all, that little process they have is completely redundant and causes them a lot of confusion. I placed my order at one register and was told to pay at another. Once I got to that one, the woman did not know what my order was so we had to go down a list of like 12(her words). When we got to my order, there was a mistake; I asked for the smear to be on the side but the man at the first registered forgot to put it in. She immediately got irritated for having to change one tiny thing... and it wasn't like the bagel was already made or anything.

I would definitely try it again, at a different location."}
{"text":"I like their breakfast and that's the reason I've been catering from Einstein for my staff meetings for a sometime now. But they really disappointed me not once but twice. I always call to place my order at least 24hours before and I ask for a time frame where the food will be there before my staff arrives. Last time they arrived 40 minutes late. I was upset but at least the food arrived. Yesterday I called to place a breakfast order for this morning. They took down my information and ran my card for the amount of the order. I asked to please have the food deliver from 7:45 to 8:00 AM today. My staff meeting starts and the food has not been delivered. Worried that they may be running late again, I call to check on the delivery. The costumer service employee asks for my information and sees that the order was never \"placed\". I had 25 employees waiting to eat and no food for them. I had to scramble to find another place to order food. If you call for cater food, DOUBLE CHECK THE ORDER WAS \"PLACED\". I will no longer cater from Einstein again."}
{"text":"I come here in the morning before class when I know I need something quick and light to keep my stomach from growling for all of my classmates to hear. My go-to is the Honey Whole Wheat bagel, always toasted and topped with the Honey Almond Shmear... So good! I love the sweetness of the Shmear and the added texture from the almond pieces. I'm also a fan of the Everything bagel. What's not to love?

The staff at this location is always super friendly and patient! They keep the morning rush flowing and I'm in and out in no time."}
{"text":"Einstein brothers can never go wrong! Bagels are always delicious. I absolutely love the everything bagel and their selection of fruit cup and juices. I am especially a fan of their \"buy a drink, get a snack free\" deal that goes on at the end of their day. Wish it was 24 hrs!! Always a good service too. For a bagel place, I can't expect any more."}
{"text":"At 9:30am this was their donut selection!! They were out of their most popular bengals that should definitely not be unavailable. I asked when more would be coming out and they said an HOUR!! Looking closely, the bagels did not look appetizing. I walked to the Pink Box next to them and got 16 donuts to bring to work the office instead. Don't waste your time, I usually am a big fan of this chain.. go to a different location."}
{"text":"They had no bananas on a Saturday morning. Ended up having a plain bagel with egg and sausage. Eggs were over-peppered."}
{"text":"I come here a few times a month. Love the friendly crew. I'm always greeted with a cheerful good morning and even if there's a line, it goes by fast. I always get the cinnamon raison bagel with honey almond smear. Their vanilla hazelnut fresh brew is delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing people, clean area and great service. I've never tasted salmon that tastes so European, as it is a part of my daily diet and hard to find here in the states. 

Always glad to walk across one of the Einstein locations. This one is definitely one of the friendliest and cleanest. 

Dorothy's vibe was amazing. She informed us very patiently about the broad alternatives available at Einstein's. 

They have nice outside seating too but it's gotta cool down a little bit before you can actually sit there and enjoy your bagel. 

Will be back definitely!"}
{"text":"Had to take my review back. My only good experience was my 1st time here.

The last 3 times I came here , the experience was horrific. My sandwich was wrong multiple times and I seen many people giving their food back because it's wrong. I only have a 30 minute lunch and I don't have time to come back because they can't get a simple bagel sandwich right. They already take enough time getting the food ready. 

Today, I stood at the register(first one in line) for my order to be taken for 10 minutes which is insane and I ultimately walked out.

I won't be back and I suggest you try somewhere else. I will be giving a survey review as well.

I'm headed to Starbucks!"}
{"text":"They got great bagel/sandwiches, bagel spread and coffee drinks here. 

Lately, they got this \"bagel thin lunch\" where there's two (one for breakfast and one for lunch) kinds of bagel sandwiches for under 350 calories. Once I saw that I was like, whether if it taste good or not...I'll take it.

It was called a Bagel Thin Club. There's turkey, avocado, tomatoes and onions. To my surprise, it was DELICIOUS! Whenever I come here, this is what I will get. 

Also, their coffee drinks are pretty good here too. 

I personally love their bagel spread. It's 25% (i think) reduce fat than regular cream cheese and their Sun-dried Tomato spread was really flavorful. Salmon was good too.

Open for breakfast and lunch hours only.
Convenient and close to where I live....pretty good food and drinks...here's 5 stars to ya Einstein Bros!"}
{"text":"Bagels and bagel sandwiches are a fairly good value.  The coffee drinks here can be hit or miss.  Sometimes they taste like they were just thrown together.  There flavors aren't balanced.  The dining room can get a little messy but it is very small and probably just can't handle the rush volume.  The staff is generally very pleasant.  I usually go a little later in the day so there is usually less of a selection.  However I have noticed this with multiple locations and it is expected.  The cream cheese flavors are good.  I'm a fan of the pretzel bagel with garlic and herb cream cheese or the hashbrown bagel with smoked salmon cream cheese.  Lots of options and very convenient."}
{"text":"I'm lowering this one more star after today's visit. This location is absolutely horrible. Keep on driving."}
{"text":"It's a regular bagel and coffee chain joint.  The only reason I'm writing is because the staff is so nice.  And free wifi and coffee refills are pretty sweet too.  

When it's nice, hit out the large outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"This is my regular Sunday breakfast stop, I love bagels. I also love this place, the staff is really freindly and the bagels are great. I have been going here a few years and the staff has been pretty much the same, that says alot for a quick serve food place. My only complaint is that I sometines come too late to get a chocloate chip coffee cake, boo!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Einstein Bagels!!! But the customer service at this location earns the 1 star rating. I stopped by here on July 26th Wednesday between 12pm-3pm. I was the only person in line. 

There were 3 sales representatives behind the counter and I stood in line politely waiting for about 5 minutes. I was told \"I will be you you in a moment\". When asked for my order,  I said \" I would like 6 plain bagels\". The sales rep aggressively replies \"We don't have 6 plain bagels\"! Taken aback by her tone, I apologetically responded \"OK, how many do you have\"? She angrily points down at the case and states \"2\". Randomly another sales rep. tries to help me with this original one standing behind her continuing to speak with me.

I tell her \"I will buy the last 2 plain and pick some other flavors...\" I quickly scan and notice a new pretzel bagel and ask \"does your pretzel bagel have egg in them\"? The one with the attitude incredulously replies \"ALL of our bagels have egg in them\" and I say \"I checked your website and most of your bagels are not made with eggs\" she then states \"We SELL the bagels, We don't MAKE them\"! She bitterly tells the  sales girl in between us \"She should look it up on the Internet\".

At this point, I don't even want to continue talking to this rude sales girl, I hastily purchase my order and make a bee line to the cash register. I was bewildered at her rudeness, I didn't even think to get her name. I love Einstein Bagels, but dread running in to this sales girl again.  She was very short tempered with me. I am really angry and upset with the situation."}
{"text":"Tried the 6 cheese bagel. My gawd it was cheesy! Also tried the BLTA on bagel thin and it was pretty good. I love the sauce on it. What I really wanted to update everyone on is that they have a good deal on soup. You can get a cup of soup that is pretty large for 3.95 and it comes with a bagel of your choice. I think thats a pretty good deal. Soups vary day to day... The cheesy broccoli was what I tried and although I wasn't a big fan of it, its still a a great value if you can find a good soup."}
{"text":"How these people keep up with the volume they're expected to handle is beyond me, but they do it. Tasty, fresh bagels, good sandwiches - what else could you want for a Sunday morning breakfast?"}
{"text":"Very displeased with the service, they were all pretty damn rude. And the kid at the register wasn't very sanitary, he was using the same gloves to touch the bagels and touch the computer screen at the same time. Definitely don't recommend coming to this Einstein Bros at all."}
{"text":"Okay what is so hard about getting the order right for one bagel. I asked toasted nope didn't do it. I asked for salmon cream cheese nope placed something else. Asked for lox got two shitty dried out pieces.  
Just hard to get a good bagel unless you make it yourself or go to the Bagel Cafe."}
{"text":"Love Einstein's but this particular location is lacking. The woman at the check out didn't know what she was doing and completely ignored myself and my son for 4 minutes. Then she helped the person in line behind me who just walked up because she had been making coffee that that customer had ordered. When I told the manager he stated \"yeah we are working with her on that.\" I am a manager as well and if my employees can't grasp basic common sense then they are taken off of the frontline and shadowing people who know what they are doing. Several other employees acknowledged the issue but did nothing to fix it. Apologies with no action is just as bad. 

Props to the one employee who apologized and talked to my son about Doctor Who. Unfortunately a service industry location that is struggling with what they do every day,  customer service, and has nothing better to say but \"we're working on it\" is not somewhere I want to do business. I will drive to the Val Vista location where the food is the exact same or better and the team is great."}
{"text":"I'm really not a huge fan of this location. As far as bagels go, they are really good- I've never had one that tasted stale. But the service here could definitely use some work. The staff seems to get incredibly flustered whenever there's a rush. I came in around 10:30am and ordered a ham & swiss sandwich on an artisan bagel- come to find out 15 MINS LATER that they ran out of artisan. So, I order it plain and come to find out again that they are out of ham. Upon learning this, I ordered a new sandwich all together- which the staff then proceeded to forget about. To compensate, they refunded my money & threw in 2 free pastries with my order. The thought was appreciated, but I unfortunately can only bring myself to give 3 stars after that."}
{"text":"Updating my review because, I'm here on Sunday for the first time and having a totally different experience than my previous visits. Food is fine, but those employees. As soon as I walked in, this girl at the counter just looked at me with no smile on her face. How about a good morning?! If you're not feeling like it, smile is a least you can do. Everybody is kind of tired, so-not-wanting-to-be-there kind of attitude. I mean, it's the morning after 4th of Jul and you could've just came here from where you were partying. But that's none of my business!! Didn't nobody forced you to work here. Man!! Can't stand bad customer services."}
{"text":"I had a two-week rotation at UH, and during that two weeks I was a customer of Einstein's an embarrassing number of times.

The employees aren't the most cheerful people in the world, but they're efficient.  Order accuracy is never a problem.  They make a good cappuccino, and apparently the mocha is good as well.  I don't love their bagels compared to their competitors, but in sandwich form I tend to like them.  I wasn't a huge fan of the Nova lox sandwich, but a turkey option I tried turned out pretty well.  The pizza bagel is a good choice for a cheap option, if not a calorically friendly one.

Cheaper than Wolfgang Puck and arguably better than the main cafeteria."}
{"text":"Ok where do I start? So I go into Einstein's there's a few customers sitting down enjoying their food and there is no line at the register. I'm thinking I'm in luck, in and out in a couple mins. So I'm in front of the register for a couple mins and getting passing looks from the employees walking back and forth behind the counter. So at that point Im looking at my watch periodically trying to see how long it's going to take to get served. Because by this time they've already made eye contact and noticed me. No greeting like \"I'll be there in a moment\" or anything. There were 2 employees making the same bagel sandwich. After Ive been in line for about 7 mins one of the sandwich girls decided approach me and take my order. I told her I wanted the box and she ask what I wanted and I looked and there were maybe a total of 3 baskets behind the glass that weren't empty, the protein bar basket, blueberry bagel basket and a basket with 3 plains. I asked if there were any more bagels and she acknowledged by pointing at a bakers rack. I then asked which ones did they have and she gave me a sigh as she went to the rack. At that point I told her to give me whichever 13 count total and she sliced them per my request and provided the cashier my order. The cashier was a bit older than the rest of the crew so I'm assuming she was the shift leader, she didn't ask me if I wanted anything else or greeted me, just held out her hand and took my card. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AT AN EINSTEIN BAGELS STORE EVER!!!! Shitty customer service! Hopefully management reads these reviews so they're aware that this location is in need of some serious in depth customer service training. This location is hurting the Einstein brand."}
{"text":"this store needs a little help compared to some of the other ones around town, they rush you at the register and then get yr order wrong, every single time I go in there this happens , I get into my car and its the wrong breakfast sandwich after I clearly stated what ingredients I don't want.  and they are so slow , last week I waited 20 mins for my banana smoothie."}
{"text":"they keep running out of bananas. very disappointed. my group is always craving the nutty monkey but we cant get the nutty monkey since they keep running out of bananas."}
{"text":"Meh... Bagels are alright, but not great.  They often end up feeling stale after toasted instead of crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  As others have stated, prices are pretty steep for what is offered.  I have tried the drip coffee twice, both times the \"medium\" roast more resembled muddy water than coffee, lacked flavor.  In a bind, a bagel and cream cheese from here is fine, keeps my stomach from growling, but if I had another option within a five minute walk of my office I'd take it.  Gets three stars because the customer service is usually quite friendly.  Food gets 2-stars."}
{"text":"These guys, except the mustached guy, are inept.  Within 15 minutes I witnessed 5 order mistakes. They left my sausage in the microwave.
Usually a 3 stars bc the workers are pretty rude but not so inept."}
{"text":"I was never really introduced into the bagel world until I moved to the east coast. The cold, inclement weather would drive me home, whence i would enter the basement and peak into the pantry. Starving my ass off I would grab one of those bagels you'd buy at one of those wholesale stores, in packs of 50. I would devour the vaguely \"fresh\" raisin bagel and immediately head off to mop floors or start an MIT problem set that would be due the next day. These were the kind of bagels that kept me alive while I succumbed to the masochism of the Boston/Cambridge college life. The bagels I would eat after a horrendously brutal crew workout. The poor bagels earned a dark, treacherous connotation, a symbol of my entrance into the brutal nature of adult life.

Freshmen year ended, and flew off to Las Vegas, NV to begin a fellowship at UNLV. Couldn't ask for a better job; great professors, new friends, cool dorm, and being surrounded by restaurants. However, waking up in the morning got no easier. Luckily, right across the street from campus, conveniently approached by a lighted crosswalk, lay Einstein Bros. The 1920s-ish fresco art looked familiar. Wait a second, this was the same shit they sold at the Costco in Somerville, in those wholesale bags!
My first real experience with a fresh, wholesome bagel came in the form of a cinnamon raisin with a strawberry shmear. I expected the same crappy shit my fraternity would buy during those torturously long house meetings. But when I took the first bite, I was like \"Oh my fucking god!\" I was immediately enveloped in culinary estasy. The cream chesse melted in my mouth; the bagel was a heavenly assertion that I had met higher ends of life. 
It only got better. Honey almond wheat with an almond shmear. I wanted to freeze that point in time and live in happiness forever. Even better with the hazelnut coffee. 
Do not forget to come here on your debaucherous resort getaway to sin city. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Delicious, I kept it simple and got the Asisgo bagel with plain cream cheese. I could taste the freshness, yummy Asisgo cheese flavor and he's of all it was crispy in top but perfectly soft on the inside"}
{"text":"First of all i love Einstein Bros and i go to the Henderson location all the time, Now the only reason why i gave this location 2 stars instead 1 is because of the awesome bagels and darn good coffee sold from this fine establishment. 

Now for my complaints. I have been here twice in the morning for coffee and had to wait in line for sometime, not because the place was busy and crowded but for the POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. There must have been 5 employees behind the counter working on other things and not paying attention or IGNORING the customers waiting in line to place an order. There was only 1 person taking orders and ringing customers up after who had lackluster customer service because he/she was rushing and that was a big reason for the pile up. This happened to me the first time i was there, I thought things would change when i came there the second time but nothing changed. I'll go to a different location next time.."}
{"text":"I usually go to this store because its close to home.  But it seems like everytime I go in, the service is worse.  Breakfast of course, is busiest, today was no different.  I saw only three workers, one running the registers, and two other women preparing the bagels.  Most baskets displaying the bagels were empty, so we had to ask if certain ones were available.  I waited about five minutes before someone took my order.  I ordered two breakfast sandwiches to go and asked if they could cut the sandwich in half and wrap it like a sandwich instead of putting it in a box.  I got a look of \"are you serious\", but she went ahead and did anyway.  After waiting what seems like forever (probably 10 minutes maybe) we finally got our order and they were both wrong!!!  

My son had the Applewood bacon and cheddar breakfast sandwich.  His sandwich was cold and had just a tiny piece of bacon in it.  My sandwich wasnt cut and didnt have any schmear on it!!!  My side orders were also missing.  

When I told the guy at the register what was wrong, he turned around to the other two women and from what I could understand, told them what I was missing.  Well they looked at me like they didnt care.  You know the feeling you get when someone is talking about you, well thats what I got, because the look that I got was enought to piss me off!!!
Just because I dont look like I speak spanish, guess what, I understood you word for word.  This store should be ashamed of themselves for thinking that they can talk about customers in front of their face.  

I've rarely gone back to this Einstein store for the lack of customer service they provide and how slow their service is.  Management really needs to reorganize this store so that their customer service improves."}
{"text":"First let me say that the staff was very nice and appeared to be trying very hard. However, there were only 2 people in line ahead of me and it took seventeen minutes to get one bagel.  I'm not kidding. People in line behind me got their orders before me. 

Someone else complained about the same thing and the staff member told that person that they called their order in. No they didn't.  I heard the whole transaction. They were just ridiculously unorganized and possibly short staffed to the point of total chaos.  I definitely got the impression that someone screwed up the schedule and not enough people were scheduled.  

I can't keep coming back here. This is the 2nd time I have been here in 2 months and the 2nd time this or something similar has happened.  It's no longer a fluke, but a badly run business.  So bummed. I'm not usually in a rush to get to work, but I can't take this much time for one, toasted bagel.  It's absurd. It took 17 minutes to get the bagel, but that doesn't include the time I spent in line before I ordered it and got my receipt. That's just the time from when I paid."}
{"text":"It's okay.

I ordered a LARGE coffee the other day and the lady taking my order didn't repeat the order back to me, so I didn't know that she thought I said MEDIUM. Weird... those words don't sound alike, lol.

The set up of the dining space is kind of annoying. All the seating is squished together.

Things are pretty overpriced, but Einstein Bros is overpriced so that's not the location's fault."}
{"text":"Very crappy service ! Very rude and crabby workers ! Gave me the wrong order then when I brought the bag back in they gave the bag to the lady two behind me I'm sick with a cold I touched her food and they still gave it too her !!! Gross !!! Very disappointed ! Very disorganized crew working !!!"}
{"text":"No arugula, sub capers on a thin bagel, or just do whatever you want to my breakfast....again."}
{"text":"Love the bagels but, service is a hot mess!"}
{"text":"I tried their $2.99 blueberry bagel bites that come in a clear plastic cup.  They're easy to eat but don't tell anyone that I gobbled 'em down while driving.  Next, I had the $3.79 caramel frappucino that comes in only 1 size, kind of a medium 14 oz-ish appearing that tastes like a caramel coffee milkshake, I think definitely better than Starbucks.  I like my (0.99 ea or $12.99 baker's dozen w 2 cream cheeses) bagels plain: the cinnamon, blueberry, & Asiago cheese ones all pass muster.  You can taste without the topping how fresh they are."}
{"text":"I ordered a bagel  based on what I saw in the case and paid... only to be told they were out of the bagels I ordered. Chose another bagel..... tasted like burnt toast with very little cream cheese. Pastry was not fresh (cherry danish was actually hard) and tasted stale. SLOW service. Took forever to even be acknowledged. I am literally shocked this location is still in business."}
{"text":"Great service. Came in at the end of the breakfast rush, wanting dinner after working all night. They didn't have what I wanted, so they let me choose anything else on the menu. Very friendly folks!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years and there was a time I would have consistently given them 4 stars, but those days are apparently over. On both of our last 2 visits, each in the last three weeks, the stores available bagel variety has been roughly 2/3 of normal. If we were visiting late in the day this wouldn't be as much an issue since I can understand not wanting a bunch of end of day waste, but this is happening in the 9:30-10:30am time frame. Ironically as I write this a couple sat down at the table next to us an immediately the husband exclamed, \"This place is a s#!t hole and walked to the restroom to get some wet paper towels to wipe the table. He then pointed put to his wife that many other tables were dirty as well. For perspective there are currently 12 total people in the store about 6 on the patio and only one of those folks are actually in line ordering. The place is far from busy. A lady from still another table just approached the counter and asked for a wet rag so she can clean her own table. A year ago I wouldn't have recommended avoiding this location but I can't say the same today. On a positive note I had a Farmhouse sandwich on an asiago bagel and it was very good."}
{"text":"The Einstein Bros. Bagels at the corner of Decatur and Sahara is the location my wife and I go to most often. This store is generally far less busy than other locations around town so getting a table is almost never a problem. The staff does a good job to expedite your order so the wait time is generally pretty short.  I don't want to spend time talking about the bagels because I'm sure most everyone on the planet has had them but this location will save you the wait and seating hassles of locations like Summerlin."}
{"text":"Finally  I got the  chance  to  try  this  place, a lot  of  my friends  have  given  great  reviews. I walked in and the place was clean and somewhat  busy, although  there wasn't much of a line. I told the lady it was my first time there, she was friendly  but spacey. While making my order she was talking to another  Co worker (the conversation  didn't seem work related).  my wife  and I decided to try a few bagels w/ light cream cheese and hot tea.  I was a bit annoyed when we were ordering. I asked what type of teas they had and the girl motioned towards the teas in front the register... I said oh!  And felt kinda of silly I didn't know that,  but then again it was my first time. When we paid I sort of just stood there when the lady just placed an empty cup on the counter I wasn't  sure what to do next, we quickly understood that we had to make our own tea (which we liked that part but the lady failed to tell us where to get the hot water)and we were still  wondering  what to do .... do we wait there for our order ? Or are they going to call me?   I mean come on I told the lady it was my first time :(   a little communication would be nice.  

After we got our order and got situated I was disappointed to see that our bagels had so much cream cheese  we had to scrape so much off (maybe if the lady paid a little attention  to the customer or if your not ready to serve people try   asking  me to wait or better yet ask some one  else  to tend the customers  until your done gossiping ) aside from that the bagels were so good. Very fresh in taste, I like my bagels to be toasted but soft in the center and our bagels were just that way.  We really liked them. And the tea was good.  I gave this place a 3 out of 5 for the costumer service. 

If I judged this place off  of the food I would give it a five. We would definitely  come back but maybe at a different  time."}
{"text":"I stopped going to this Einsteins awhile ago but when I was hungry walking by it the other day I just stopped thinking I would give it another chance. Boy I was wrong. Same old Einsteins I always new. The service was terrible and they rushed everything. Next time I need to remember to stay clear of this place and hit up another Einsteins"}
{"text":"Horrible, rude and slow. Avoid!!!!! Horrible customer service, no friendliness, no hello. Over four people in line as 3 workers just sat and stared. Awful!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't stop thinking about the great experience I had here yesterday! I forgot to eat breakfast and had some extra time so I stopped in. I had never been to this location before but when I walked in a whole group of employees greeted me with Hi and Welcome like they knew me! It was so sweet. And the ordering was a very pleasant experience! Then when they brought me my food they gave me a free cookie! They were all so kind and friendly and smiley! I loved my experience here!!"}
{"text":"I always forget to review this location, though we have used them multiple times.
This morning I was in the Flamingo Einstein's as you see in my reviews. There was food but I walked out, due to a deficient staff.

All that needs to be said: Sahara/Decatur offers great customer care!!!
Definitely choose this location.
We ordered the banana nutella topper, the veggie topper, toasted everything, and cinnamon streudel."}
{"text":"First time customers a couple days ago.

My husband and I stopped by to try the bagels. We've never been here before. We ordered our bagels and they were delicious. The bagel came sliced and toasted Covered with a lot of cream cheese. It was so good. 

2nd visit

My husband and I decided to come back because it was so good last time. We ordered the exact same thing as last time. Our bagels were cold, barely any cream cheese (most of the bagel was plain). My husband took his back in to ask for more cream cheese and to be toasted more. There was a lady with long blond hair in a ponytail. She gave him attitude and argued with him that his bagel was toasted. She toasted the bagel and again gave him barely any cream cheese.

I think we've had enough of this place. To bad because the first visit was great.."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love getting our breakfast bagels here but the customer service is absolutely atrocious. We went at around 1pm and the lady that helped us (Sandra) was so rude. First we weren't ready to order and we let her know we needed a couple of minutes and she just rolled her eyes and went back to mopping the floor. When we finally ordered we decided we wanted to take half a dozen bagels and cream cheese to take home and she just seemed so bothered that we were ordering again. I mean we were the only people inside this place it's not like they had a line. How is this place suppose to make money with employees that don't even want to sell because one simple order seems like their hands are going to break from making it. Worst customer service! It really sucks because I love the establishment"}
{"text":"I would just like to inform the previous poster that Einstein Brothers is actually Noah's Bagels sister company.  Noah's is a west coast only brand while Einstein's is the bigger, national brand.  They are both owned by the Einstein Noah Restaurant Group. 

And I love both bagels."}
{"text":"Consistently slow service, always the bare minimum working. Try not to come in when it's busy."}
{"text":"My family and I haven't eaten at this place,decided to try it a couple of days ago. We went in around 11am. It's located in a beautiful area. It was crowded at all. We ordered two breakfast sandwich and two coffees. It cost a bit over $20 which was a little over the top, the sandwich could have at least had a real egg in it for that price. However, everything tasted great and the food was brought over. The staff were all friendly and helpful and it happen to be a clean environment! I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped in about 7:30 on a Friday morning and just beat the crowd. It was a good thing because the service was slow and there was nobody in front of us. My order was simple. A self serve beverage and a toasted bagel with butter. The bagel came with plenty of butter, but was not toasted. Already disappointed with the wait time, the cold bagel only made matters worse. The manager scolding another employee in front of other employees and customers only added to an already sub par experience. As always, I am not opposed to giving them another shot to see if it gets any better."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week and its always good... I had a questionable experience here once and they fixed the problem immediately. I had a Turkey Tornado Wrap (no longer on menu) and it was Nothing like the photo and had barely any Turkey (I mean barely)... It was right at closing (2:45pm-ish) and I was with friends who saw my wrap and said \"that looks nothing like the photo\"... I was upset, so I took a photo of it and sent it (and a photo of the receipt)to the Online suggestion box of Einsteins Corporate. Within hours I had a response and they sent me a coupon for another one. I didn't do it to get a free sandwich, but then the same day the branch manager sent me an email inviting me back in to have a free lunch... That was nice. I came back in a week later and took him up on his offer. That is why I keep coming back... The detailed follow up of Service... And the food is good..! Good job.!"}
{"text":"This place disappoints.  One time I came in and they stuffed my bagel and lox with so many capers that it inedible, I had to flick them all off.  The last time I came in (and I do mean last) there were a group of teens working... well not actually working but standing around talking and playing tricks on each other.  When they finished making my bagel they just let it sit there and didn't bother calling my name.  I had to interrupt them and ask them if I could have my bagel.  It's disappointing because I use to come in this place often and the service was quick and friendly but they must be under new management now."}
{"text":"I eat super healthy and this place has healthy options! I love the bagel thins and the turkey chili is amazing."}
{"text":"Came in this morning excited to get breakfast. Needless to say first encounter the lady was t in a pleasant mood. After I ordered and paid. I stood by the register waited 20 mins while other people for there orders. I then walked to the lady I paid and asked her about my order. While I look behind her a young lady that was cooking whipped her nose on her gloves and snarked over to me and yelled \" I called ur name\" I said I'm standing right here. Why would u bring everyone order to register and call their name. But suddenly my order ur standing next to the oven to call my name. Then a gentleman standing next to me. Says don't feel bad they do this all the time. This was my first time here and I have to say worst service."}
{"text":"First and foremost, there's a drive thru (For Starbucks apparently) but it wasn't marked Starbucks until we got to the order speaker, which we then had to drive thru. Confusing. Also, this store's order location and pay location was confusing. There's two entrances but the order location is on the far right of the store and then we had to pay at the counter behind us. Weird. We sat down to wait on our food, which came quickly, but the order was incorrect. The person who brought our food invited us to go get our chips for our sandwiches but when I got mine and opened the bag, someone else came up to our table to confront us saying it didn't come with chips (my order, at least) and that I had to pay for it. My friend went to fix her food and pay the cost of the chips but the guy later returned to me with a paper showing I owed money on the chips still... Which my friend had already paid for. Very unorganized and embarrassing to approach us like that with other customers looking at us. On top of that, my egg whites taste like rubber and the veg out sandwich, my friends order, with only a couple turkey slices added to it, isn't worth $10.00. Won't be coming back, please find a friendlier staff."}
{"text":"Samantha and James were absolutely amazing and had the best customers service. Especially for being the fist customers of the day early in the morning. James was more than excited to be the baker and that made the bagels taste better, made with love. As well as Samantha was on point a wonderful cashier. Only let down was they had no tip jar. Wish they did, the deserve it!!!!! Thank you to Samantha and James for being so nice last time we were there the red headed cashier she was pretty cool too. Will def has this as our regular bagel shop from now on."}
{"text":"Everytime I come in and order the same two bagels and it's usually the manager helping me. What's great is, she remembers my order and no matter how busy it is, she still has a smile on her face. She says hello to me and \"have a great day\" each and every time I walk in and out of the store as well! 
Wonderful service from her and all the staff! They even spell my name right!"}
{"text":"Diana and Miguel just made my day!! Nicest people and fabulous team!! I will be back :)"}
{"text":"DON'T GO HERE IF YOU WANT A DOZEN BAGELS, unless you call ahead the day before to order them. They don't cook enough in the mornings so if you go in the late morning there are none left. If you go in the early morning you get attitude from the employees about taking all the bagels. They were actually rationing bagels at 6am and wouldn't give me more than 6 of a single kind, saying they had to leave enough for other customers. I wanted a single type so pointed out that if they couldn't provide the product I was going to have to go to another place so they grudgingly gave me the kind I asked for but punched a bunch of finger holes in the bagels. It wasn't just me either the folks getting a dozen in front me got told no to one of their bagel requests, being told they were running too low to give any more out. DON'T GO HERE FOR A DOZEN unless you don't care what kind you get or don't mind starting your day off with being yelled at and damaged bagels at 6 am."}
{"text":"I tend to like einsteins a lot though this was my first time to this location which seemed to be ran entirely different. I ordered the veggie sandwich with hummus 6.99 and added turkey slices $2.50. My friend ordered the asparagus, mushroom and egg white bagel 4.99. Setup was weird for ordering we had to pretty much back track after ordering to another station to pay our order. Staff did not seem happy to work here.. Also seems unprofessional. We were instructed that our food would arrive to our table so we took a seat. It was mediocre up u too this point..... When the order arrived we were told we may grab our chips from the chip station since our sandwiches came with chips. The employee directed us to the chip station. We grabbed chips and then returned to our table to eat. At which point I realized the extra $3.00 I paid to add turkey on my sandwich (which is outrageous) wasn't added to the sandwich. I walked up to have the fix the order. I waited while other customers were helped before me. Hmmm.. Instead of remaking the sandwich he took the sandwich from my hands and put two slices of turkey on it (for $3.00) um okay. Upon returning to my table a secondary employee was confronting my friend because apparently her sandwich did not come with chips. How rude to speak so loudly where other customers were looking. As if we could care less about the $1.00 chips. Just a reminder we were instructed to grab chips... Unknown to us that her meal didn't come with them. We paid for the chips since she opened them already. We will not be coming back here. Get your $h1t together!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok fuck this place. I ordered a lunch sandwich and underneath \"lunch\" on the menu, it says that all lunch orders come with a side of your choice. When I got back to my car I realized the kid behind the counter never asked me what side I wanted. So I went back in with my receipt and the kid told me it was a typo and it didn't come with a side but the asked his manager (a woman with a foreign accent) who was extremely rude to him yelling, \"so what did you need? What are you asking me!?\" And the kid simply asked her if I could just have the side figuring that's exactly what it says on the menu. The manager, piece of shit lady, then looks at me and asks me \"what exactly I wanted!?\" (Mind you she was extremely rude to me) which my response was to her was if I was inconveniencing her and all of the sudden she turned super nice but it was too late because she had already pushed me right into bitch mode from her being so rude not only to her employee but to me as well. I grabbed a bag of chips and stormed out. This was the worst experience ever to where I got into a yelling match at a manager. That lady is a straight up cunt and I'll never go back. I feel sorry for the employees there that have to deal with her on a daily basis. Will definitely be writing to corporate."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bagel while waiting to pick up my husband at the airport. The place was slow and the kid behind the counter didn't acknowledge me for a bit. I dont like that. It gets under my skin. You see me there, look at me, wave at me, something!

I wanted a well done toasted bagel with butter. Although there were not a lot of people in there, it seemed to take a bit to get it.

When the bagel came out, they used WAY to much butter. No regard for my arteries or my cholesterol. No love for the product you are giving to someone to eat. *another pet peeve*"}
{"text":"I've came here for the past year and a half thinking they would change but they don't . The man who took my order did everyone else's drink and asked me what I was waiting on. I literally waited ten minutes for a hot cup of water for me tea . It's every time I come here .. I'm always complaining how slow they are ... Other peoples food and drinks come out fast. Just never mine . I'm done trying to come to this one on campus , they either need a new staff or need more people on at once . I would rather wait in the long line at subway and Starbucks ."}
{"text":"Bagels were great, warm and fresh. Lots of great flavors (cheese and bacon? Yes, please!). The person that took my order was friendly and pleasant, but the person at the register was not. Cashier was pretty moody, snapping at and berating co-workers, mumbling answers to guests. Honestly, just dealing with the cashier put me in a bad mood. Maybe the person was just having a bad day, but I think I'll stick with the Einstein's on Cheyenne."}
{"text":"Omg all the bad reviews are so true. They either need more employees or FASTER ones. They all need to drink some coffee and stop looking so miserable. Took me about 20 mins in line to order then another 8 to pay. There's way too much small talk going on especially if there's 5 parties in line."}
{"text":"The main reason I come here is for coffee. About three times out if the six I have come here for coffee they either don't have it brew or its the wrong one . I usually get the neighborhood  blend non decaf.  Its sad to say this but I used to love Einstein Bros Bagels and now I am looking into finding a different place just because they never have the basics. I picked the neighborhood  blend because I enjoy the taste. The other options simply don't work out for my palate.  

They have an variety of sandwiches, but honestly the only reason its always busy its because its conveniently located next to a parking structure. 

This place doesn't't give a side with your lunch order so have that in mind."}
{"text":"Crappy customer service. Rude staff. They keep messing up my order. I went in today I asked for no tomatoes but Sandra (I guess that was her name) still put tomatoes in my bagel and when I asked her to fix it I got really rude response and she rolled her eyes and made faces."}
{"text":"I came here late morning to take advantage of my birthday email.  I'm not generally a fan of Einstein's in general because the service is so spotty no matter the location.  At least that's been my experience.  There was absolutely no line when I entered and two people behind the counter.  I think the problem is they were both helping me versus what I've seen at other locations where you order at one end and pay at the other.  So I ordered my breakfast sandwich as a combo meal with fruit as my side.  Bag handed to me with no fruit.  I also placed a second order for a desert because I had a coupon for 20% off that could not be combined with my free sandwich offer.  I assumed all my items were packed in one bag because, again, I'm the only person there and the same person rang me up and I thought packed my items.  I drive away and something told me to check.  Of course no dessert.  I make a U-turn and head back to the store.  I told them I didn't get my dessert.  The food preparer said, \"Aren't there any in the basket by the cashier? \"  No.  He said, \"There usually is and proceeded to get me one from behind the counter.  Oh, how I wish I could have taken my tip back!  Also, the fruit side is not worth it.  Smallest serving of fruit ever!"}
{"text":"The manager at this location is absolutely terrible. He is so rude to all of his customers and he knows he can get away with it because he's the manager. I was ordering and he totally interrupted me and basically told me to hush. The way he talks to people is so belittling. Not only is he rude to customers but from what I can see, he is rude to employees as well. It's just so disheartening to see someone be treated so poorly. The only reason I liked this location was because of one specific employee but she probably quit because of how rude he was to her. I'll be going to a different location from now on"}
{"text":"This is a convenient place to go for a quick bite and some coffee.  I'm not often pleased with the service or cold the food is, even after multiple requests for the bagel to be hot.  I always ask for the bagel sandwiches to be toasted and hot, but rarely does it actually come to me warm at all.  

One time I was here and they were moving a couple of gigantic coffee containers across the floor on a rolling table, and the entire canister slammed to the ground and flooded the area with coffee.  Luckily I was not sitting right there, but there were a couple tables nearby.  It was so tacky, and in bad taste.  The people who work here don't seem to strive to show off their best, from what I've experienced, and it doesn't add to the experience...  At least the coffee is usually hot."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating einsteins.  Unfortunately the service at this location isn't too impressive.  Even if there isn't much of a line I have to wait a while for my food.  Over the summer I know they had someone from corporate come out and help with their efficiency.  Their speeds of service was great while corporate was there but quickly returned to slow as mud once corporate departed.  I really like eating here but I have to plan ahead to allow enough time for their slow service.  
I really enjoy their cinnamon raisin bagel with honey almond spread. Unfortunately I won't be eating here again anytime soon because of the 15 minute wait to get a bagel."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times because it's fast, delicious and convenient for me to stop by (right off of rainbow, easy to hop off and on) on my way to work. I've always had a good experience.

Years later, I got pregnant and I thought that I had to give up my delicious cream cheese shmear. Soon-to-be moms are limited to cheeses that are fully melted or made of pasteurized milk and you wouldn't how difficult it is to find cheeses that have been labeled with this information. You'll see on einstein's shmear tubs that their cream cheese is made of pasteurized milk. It's delicious and preggie friendly. Their tubs are also made of plastics that are bpa/hazardous free (not numbers 3, 6 and 7 which are known to cause miscarriages).

To top off this exciting news, I lost my phone today at Einstein bagel and you wouldn't believe how helpful they were. They took my information and let me know that they would contact me after they check the cameras. Luckily one of the employees was able to find my phone in the back. Good, honest people are so hard to find and I'm so thankful that they were kind enough to hold onto the lost phone till someone claimed it. My phone is valued at $800 new but I wasn't so worried about the cost of my phone because I had insurance, but losing a phone these days is kind of like losing a file on your entire life... It's  not a good feeling. 

Thank you again to the staff at Einstein bagel :)"}
{"text":"One of the best einstein locations because the staff is really hard working and aim to please"}
{"text":"Went there this morning. This was my very first visit at Einsten Bro's and I wasn't a pleasant one. I asked what the bagel had the salmon or whatever fish that was. Robin behind the counter was not very nice. She was frowning the whole time and like didn't want to be there. Food was great though. Had bacon and cheddar on asiago bagel. Wife like the Lox too. Everyone else was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here it's always so slow! The service is horrible! There's only one girl I love but I never see her anymore! I always wait up to 20 minutes for my order while there's 5 people back there"}
{"text":"I had to make a sudden/urgent business trip to my LV office.  I get up at 4am, hop on the plane by 6, and touchdown at 8.  Grab my bag and walk aimlessly around the airport looking for a cab.  Finally I find the line and hop into the car.  I tell my driver, Jamal, from Somalia the address I need to get to and instruct him to stop by someplace to get bagels.  But those bagels weren't for me.  I wanted to be nice and bring bagels for everyone in the office.  So Jamal takes me to Einstein's since it's on the way and tells me this is the best place for bagels in Vegas.
  
I walk in and the sweet aroma of bread welcomes me.  There are a lot of people sitting down enjoying their morning coffee and bagels.  By the time I get to the front to order, my brain is on sleep mode so I tell the guy to just give me a dozen bagels picked at random with plain & sun dried tomato cream cheese and also offer to buy Jamal breakfast.  

Judging from the guys face I'm sure he knew that I was half asleep and got everything in order for me.  They also have varieties of bagel sandwiches which looked really tasty. 

Jamal drops me off in front of my building and we say our goodbyes and part ways.  I bring the bagels up and immediately tear into one because I was starving.  

Sorry for the long boring story lol.  In a nut shell, their establishment is clean and organized, the staff is friendly and cool, and the bagels are tasty.  The best thing about it is that they are pre-cut so no more struggling with a knife trying to cut through risking on cutting yourself."}
{"text":"They got our order wrong. The winter blend coffee is not hot at all. I ordered a peppered bacon melt. It was suppose to have 2 eggs (only got one) and a slice of tomato (there was none. Also so much cream cheese was in the sandwich it was oozing out everywhere. I don't usually come to this location & will not be back. The cashier was  professional & gave great customer service."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy coming to this location. I think they must have changed management. I only visit about once every 2-3 months for staff meeting food. The energy is low with the employees. The manager has an apparent  sour attitude. I seen her and another employee giving each other a look while serving a customer that may have been a little indecisive. It was very unprofessional. The other employee was not happy to be there herself. There is a few employees that are wonderful and they would be the only reason I would return."}
{"text":"Great customer service this morning from the 3 person crew at Einstein's working a busy hungry crowd. Did their best to attend to everyone and were still polite, friendly and smiling. Thank you, I appreciate you guys."}
{"text":"People are savage in the morning and rightfully so. My bagel tasted like a bagel. Exactly what I wanted. The staff seemed super friendly. MoD was on the floor and was helpful to staff. Bagels are bagels are bagels, thumbs up"}
{"text":"When you need a snack and a place to study, this is the place to go and still stay on campus. It is a chain so the food is pretty consistent, it is easy and fast."}
{"text":"Eat there at your own risk!  If possible, I would have rated no stars.  Not only do the staff find it a challenge to get your order right (pick a bagel, any bagel) but the staff evidently don't know how to use a broom or kitchen towel.  At 9:00  a.m, the tables and chairs were littered with food from previous customers and the floor was covered with food as well.  The birds were having a feast with the food scattered outside.  With the obvious lack of cleanliness seen on simple observation, you have to wonder what's going on behind the scenes."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff... Fast service. Breakfast here is such a joy and different than every day normal. Bagels and lox for $6.99....cmon.  
Feed the craving and go to Einstein brothers you'll be happy you did"}
{"text":"This location is convenient and since it is on campus it makes it easy for students to eat here. It is located inside the SEB (science and engineering building.) They have the same menu as other Einsteins locations. Depending on what time you guy it can get very busy. It is going to take longer for you to get your food if it is busy. So I recommend going early, or at a time when everyone is in class, or when students leave.

The service depends on who is working that day. Usually when I go they are very sweet and sometimes joke around with you. I noticed on days at the end of the week they might run out of items. But it doesn't happen often. It is a good option if you want to avoid the craziness in the SU. You can also study here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bagel this afternoon and another guest was very rude to the ladies behind the counter. The ladies were very lovely and took great care of this awful guy. Kudos to the ladies' excellent customer service. I had a bagel with garlic & chive shmear and a coffee. The food is always good here."}
{"text":"My 2nd time in this store and it never failed to amaze me was it's a busy store yet 2 crew on the line; 1 registry available. And a crappy customer service. (Sorry I am not bashing, this is just how it is.) no smiles, no greets, no thankyou's. And to think they're actually besides a bank (a connecting door is just besides it) the store ambience and the size was a plus yet they're lacking of customer device and crew. I'll follow up again next time maybe they'll be better so I give them a 1 star."}
{"text":"2 stars for convenience because it's right by campus, but that's it. Dave took our order, but he completely ignored any questions we had. They're out of most bagels, and they don't have a machine to make espresso drinks despite the drinks being listed on the menu. One of the bagel sandwiches we got was made wrong (no special order, they just forgot the basic ingredients of the sandwich). When we did get the right food it was good like Einstein's should be. Biggest complaint: what kind of place doesn't accept credit cards? Seriously, it's 2018."}
{"text":"I ordered a bagel with cheese and bacon. They tried to charge me for an egg sandwich. He assured me it was ok because they would leave the egg off. I pointed out that doing it that way, they would charge me a dollar extra. It's $3.99 for a bagel with cheese and bacon, $4.99 for an egg sandwich with or without the egg. There is no reason for charging me a dollar extra for the same product. If they didn't have the capability to ring up those items separately, that would be different. However, both bacon and cheese are offered as add on items. This is just a way to steal a dollar extra from patrons. I walked out without making a purchase. It's a bad \"policy\" and should be corrected."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best bagels around town. First timer here and I gotta say I am pleased! Looked busy from the outside but we didn't wait long at all!"}
{"text":"I recently visited this store for prior to a work meeting, to pick up bagels and coffee box. They were very busy and making the coffee box got missed. I brought it to their attention, and upset because I was going to be late. Everybody was very apologetic and jumped right into gear to get it done quickly. They continued to apologize and made me a complimentary specialty coffee drink. 
Mistakes are made, especially when you're really busy. The important thing was how they responded with sincerity and a strong attempt to make it right. That is what good customer service is. I will continue to give them business."}
{"text":"I periodically stop at Einstein Brothers to buy bagels.  I really like salt bagels but they don't make these.  They just have pretzel bagels with some salt on them.  I stopped to get 1/2 dozen bagels so I could have something different for breakfast.

The bagels are good, but I think they're more expensive that some other places.  Service here was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast at 8am and the line was out the door. They got our food pretty quickly so I can't complain. The only real negative is that the tables are right on top of one another and it got relatively loud. The food was yummy and I was told the coffee was good as well (but I didn't have any so I'll have to take everyone else's word for it). Love the new holiday flavors as well. Cinnamon Sugar Cream Cheese on an Apple Cinnamon Bagel was heavenly."}
{"text":"Once I walked in the atmosphere was dead and non-welcoming. No energy. I decided to try the new bacon and cheddar bagel or whatever  and it was terrible the bagel was still cold, egg was fake, would have been better off with nova lox bagel ; I also got an iced chai latte with caramel, Brown head employee does not know how to read a order because she missed Camel in my latte. Really not that difficult. I would be better off just going to the Einstein bagels on Val Vista! Plus they have a drive-thr"}
{"text":"Went to get bagels and a sandwich ... First cashier struggled on the register to ring my order up ... Turkey cheddar no onions/ mayo on pretzel bagel... Finally got my Order ran to work cuz it took forever... Then I look she double charged me for two sandwiches which they did give me two but no pretzel bagels and onions on them... Called to speak to manager ... Was told he was too busy to answer... I asked if I could leave my number to call back and they said yeah kid was super rude and 3 hours later still no call back... Terrible"}
{"text":"Got the craving for eggs and bacon and yelp helped me located a business where I can fulfill both of these needs, even at lunch time. Yeah, Yelp!

I have not visited this Einstein's and I am so glad that I discovered it. The business it tucked away set further back, but it has its Einstein goodness inside the store. The line was fairly long today, since it seems that everyone wants their delicious bagels. The line moved very fast and smooth. Both registers were open and the line flow never failed. I ordered the Applewood Bacon and Cheddar sandwich on a cinnamon and sugar bagel. This is combo of the cinnamon and sugar and egg and cheese is sweet but sharp. And in the end is just right!

This Einstein's location is larger than most with a complete dining room and outdoor Arizona type room. No one was sitting outside since it is over 100 degrees today. Not good patio sitting weather. The tea I ordered was a rose flavor and was the right balance that I needed with the egg. With the store being so busy even as I sit and write this the lobby continues to stay full of satisfied customers. The lobby was impressively clean and so the the restroom. This is outstanding since no one wants to see a mess from others, especially in the restroom. I will visit this location again when the twins need to go to the doctor. It is such a great experience and ambiance that Einstein's provided today, plus great tasty food!"}
{"text":"Loved this location the first time we visited and haven't been disappointed yet. The food is fresh and tastes good each visit. I prefer the strawberry salad here to a competitor.  Einstein's salad has greens in it not the white bitter part of the lettuce which most people throw out. I adore the dressing as well! The sandwich options are good too. Darin usually gets the Turkey bacon avocado!  It's a rare restaurant where everyone in our little family is happy to eat at each time!"}
{"text":"Sahara & Decatur store has TERRIBLE management! After buying bagels and lox every Sunday morning for 10 years, for almost the past 2 months, the manager tells me that they have not received a packaged lox delivery for retail sale. All other stores say they get deliveries weekly. I don't know what is going on there, but I will not go back until Einstein Corporate responds to my complaints submitted at their website: einsteinbagels.com

How can you sell bagels, cream cheese, and NO LOX!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand this location there is always some  type of an issue and they never have it together so unorganized and just completely lost. Many times there so called out of stock who's in charge of making things here when your low or running out of popular item you make more and if your worried it wont sell you just make a less amount it really is not that difficult. The dinning area is not up kept up tables are usually dirty and desperately needing wiped off floor needing swept  or trash needing emptied staff is not professional friendly or helpful at all they really don't give a rats ass at all you either want what they have or have nothing at all and they just go onto the next customer in line. Well one day there is not going to be that next customer in line and there all going to be saying should have done this or that.

Well today was not any different in fact Today was the final straw. I go in around 9:30 Am to get some bagels for a company function  and there is a few people there but there is no reason the place should have looked like the way it did completely nasty so I go to place my order and yet again there out of 4 different beagles i wanted sobI ask the girl are we or can we make some more and I would even pay for them now  and either I or I would have someone come back and get them. I need them for a company function. She says na not right now this is what we have right now pointing to the display  case. I was completely floored I didn't just want 2 or 3 bagels I was needing 3 dozen in total here yes 36 bagels and again  the girl looks at me and says. \"Na not right now\" I go really she goes yep not right now. Would you like anything else. I told her no thanks you don't have what I'm looking for or need I'll just go somewhere else. She goes ok have a nice day and immediately starts talking to the customer behind me. I did ask to speak to a manager and was told they were busy right now and the shift leader told me there was nothing that could be done right now. WOW really It was obvious they did not care or want this order or they would have offered something to accommodate the order. So it's completely obvious there not maintaining there store and obviously they are not making enough to accommodate the customer so Im not really sure what they are really doing besides standing around talking and visiting with each other. If I was the owner of the location I'd be pissed that I was losing customers and money was walking out the door. So please think really hard before visiting this location save yourself any frustrations or problems or hassles and don't even bother coming to this location you could be sorry if you do. I know I wont be back anytime soon there is other choices in the area and you be much happier going elsewhere.

So I left and need to go elsewhere to get something for the company function and what do you know there was a Pink Box Doughnut right in the same parking lot with great friendly helpful staff that was more then happy to accommodate me with several dozen doughnuts."}
{"text":"It took 20 minutes for me to get a lightly toasted bagel with hummus.  They had three people behind the bagel counter and one lady working the register."}
{"text":"This location seems to never take stock of their bagel inventory and is usually out of most bagels by 9 AM. Why doesn't someone check and make more when they see they're low. This was about the 6th time I've tried to buy bagels at this location and walk out empty handed."}
{"text":"Best place for Bagels in Las Vegas.  Located across from the UNLV Student Union which not only creates a fun atmosphere, but also keeps the joint busy.  I enjoy meeting here with my employees for semi regular staff meetings.  Free wi-fi is a plus, but I usually have trouble connecting.

I love the pretzel bagel.  Toasted pretzel bagel with regular smear (cream cheese) is enough for me.  There are many choices of bagels to choose from as well as cream cheese toppings.

Einsteins has quality all you-can-drink coffee as well.  This location has two coffee competitors very close by, but neither of those other \"coffee shops\" offer such good food, specifically breakfast while keeping up with a great cup of joe.

I would suggest not ordering the Chai Latte or any other specialty drink.  Keep it simple and enjoy the quality bottomless cup of coffee Einsteins offers with your bagel."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious sandwich (Turkey & Cheddar on a cheddar bagel) sooo good! Food was fresh (bagels just came out of the oven). Staff were pleasant and friendly. Line was incredibly long and only complaint would be the EDC crowd being in there at 8am. Would definitely visit this location again."}
{"text":"I've been to Einstein's many times and this is the best experience I've ever had. I'm not sure if theres a new manager at this store or if they happen to hire the most enthusiastic cashier on the planet. 

I stopped by to get lunch yesterday and was immediately greeted and promptly serviced.  Upon checking out the cashier was all smiles and very chatty making my day that much better. At this point I'm not sure if the guy helping me was the manager but whatever his title is the customer service was fantastic!

If you come to EB's regularly you know the menu well and probably know that it's so simply it's hard to mess up. I've never had a bad every experience so far. I dig it here because it's fast and you know what your getting and at the prices your paying you can't go wrong.

I totally recommend this particular EB's for the great service, food and the central location."}
{"text":"Nothing but poor service and excuses!
Once a weekly destination, yet now we avoid it completely.
Service is horrendous and takes so long to get basic items.
Tables and overall organization is always in disarray.
We need a better option for a bagel shop in this area.
Perhaps a different location is a valid option; not this one; too many poor experiences."}
{"text":"I must preface this review with a note:  I am a bagel snob.  I used to work in a bagel shop, and as such, am HIGHLY critical of them.  (I'm actually on a personal, somewhat half-crazed, crusade to educate all who will listen that the national chain Noah's Bagels needs to be sued for false advertising since they don't have ANY bagels, only bagel-shaped bread.)

With that said, this place is just like Noah's, in that it's a chain with that super sleek, clean and impersonal feel.  If I lived nearby, it would seriously deter me from becoming a regular.  It's not bad, but it's too inorganic with too few crotchety old guys hanging out front bitching about how much better things used to be.

However, they make up for it with the fact that they aren't Noah's, and they actually sell pretty good bagels.  Not great bagels, but pretty darn good.

I stopped here a few times while in town a few weeks ago.  I liked some of the varieties of flavors, and they've got some pretty good spreads.  The lox and cream cheese didn't need the capers since the lox is already plenty salty enough.

Oh yeah... the staff was very good.  Very friendly, very personable.  I was impressed.

So, the next time I'm in town, I'll surely go again, not for a great love of this place, but because they have good enough bagels, and I am thoroughly addicted to bagels in general."}
{"text":"Omg.   It was like Tuna salad hold the tuna?? Lol.   I went here after class today.  I was never there before.  I ordered tuna on a toasted and scooped out bagel.   They did not toast my bagel and if I had not left my phone in the car ! I'd have taken a photo of my bagel that had a drop and I mean a drop of tuna on it!! I hope all their locations are NOT like this one.   Two people help you.  The cashier.  Nice guy and the sandwich maker who gives you no Tuna and seemed as if she was unhappy and did not want to be there."}
{"text":"Normally like Einstein's Bagels but this location is awful. It's dirty, seats are falling apart, stains on ceiling, flickering lights and the floors look like they haven't been cleaned in a while..."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was bad. The lady at the register was rude and looked as if she was ignoring my order. I ordered a coffee and the coffee thing was all out and hey we're out of coffee lids and the bagel containers were not full."}
{"text":"This place is horrible honestly. I came in here and wanted on simple bagel and I look and they don't have any good bagels left. I asked when they would bake some more and she said they were only selling the ones they had at for the rest of the day. You're a BAGEL place and you don't even have the plain bagel left????? Nice. I simply wanted a Nova Lox bagel and I don't want the bagel to be something sweet like cinnamon or blueberry that's disgusting. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The crew at this location were amazing. Very friendly professional and courteous. They had us In and Out in a matter of minutes which was very impressive."}
{"text":"Tried to buy a dozen plane bagels, they had about 18 and would only sell us 5... how 5... said they would be sold out too quickly if she sold us 12... So, rather than sell us 24 bagels we purchased ZERO... now she may not be smart enough to understand that 24 bagels at 1:40 in the afternoon must be a pretty large sale but hope that someone reading this will think it would have been... even if it's not a big sale a guaranteed sale of 24 has to be better than a MAYBE sale of the 18 they had???"}
{"text":"This place used to be customer friendly and the food pretty tasty.  Well, I don't know about the food anymore because the last few times I came in, I waited, and waited, and waited for someone, anyone to take an order.   The people who work here should all be drawing unemployment; GENERALIZING????  Yes, I am because it happens every damn time I walk in the place, they are either mopping, talking, or no one is around except for the cashier.  I don't have 10 minutes to waste standing around watching a menu and not getting any service.  The food is overpriced anyway, if it wasn't for UNLV and the poor starving students who have got to eat, this place would be closed.  And finally, it is filthy....no more wasting my time with Einstein's here."}
{"text":"Had the everything bagel and potato bagel with chive cream cheese and they were  pretty good. They are not the traditional chewy style bagel but more of a soft pretzel texture which is ok as long as you like that kind. The service was good but they weren't that busy either. They have a good selection but they don't have my favorite which is salt bagel. If you want a authentic bagel go to Bagelmania on Twain."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  Good food but they charged $1.50 just to put butter on my bagel.  REALLY?"}
{"text":"What is it with this location. I had a completely different view of Einstein Bagels before engineering this store. They could do no wrong in my eyes. Now I am terrified that more stores exist out there like this one. The bathrooms were dirty, It was dead inside and I know why now. All the food was stale when I got in my car and opened the wrapping. I thought I was going to gag. The only plus is that the guy that made my sandwich was friendly, even though he continually returned to me to tell me they were out of almost everything I ordered. Why can't you order in advance? That's what good employees and managers do. My recommendation is for the owner of this particular location to fire his son, cause that's clearly why the manager still has his job, which is my last complaint. The manager didn't smile once the entire time I was there and was extremely non approachable."}
{"text":"Ordered a lox bagel and they forgot the lox!!! Are you serious? How do you make a LOX bagel and forget the LOX? We took it home to eat and didn't realize it until after they were closed. They didn't give us a receipt so we can't even go back and ask for our money back. We also asked for a pickle twice and lo and behold... no pickle! This is the second time they forgot something. Will never go back here."}
{"text":"I love Einstein's, however this location has limited product and poor service. Due to sporting events we were closer to this location twice in one weekend and on both occasions the service was poor and they never had the bagel that my son wanted. Today they also burnt a plain bagel and put the wrong cream cheese on another. Drive a little farther and head to the location on the 215/Durango- you will be happy that you did!!!"}
{"text":"First off, I used to eat these bagels up all the time when I worked in a real estate office (you could never be your goal weight at a real estate office- and I worked at three of those offices), that is until I found out that each one was about 500 calories! So then, I'd just have half of one, and the other half at another time. These bagels are super soft (not hard like the supermarket brands). My favorite was the cranberry one; blueberry was my second choice.

I had gotten two gift cards over Christmas (total of $20), and so we came here for lunch on sunday. I got the turkey panini (spinach, bacon, tomatoes with onion & chive shmear) and my husband got the turkey sandwich, everything bagel (sprouts, cucumber, lettuce, tomato with onion & chive shmear)- you can also customize these sandwiches to your liking (didn't know that when we ordered)- many different shmears and type of bread. My husband chose the cheddar sun chips as his side, while I chose an orange (also, apples are available). Both sandwiches were really good; yes, we split them. When my husband asked which one I liked better, I couldn't decide, I liked them both. (Check the site for nutritional information.) 

There's also egg sandwiches, snacks (similar to Starbucks), and coffee, oops, almost forgot about the many different bagels- classic bagels (plain, everything), bagel-thins (plain, everything, honey-wheat), signature bagels (blueberry, cranberry, sesame seed, cinnamon sugar, chocolate chip, etc.), gourmet bagels (power bagel, six cheese, dutch apple)- 24 types in these categories, bagel poppers, and bulk bagels (popular for offices). 

There were a lot of people dining in when we went inside, but when we were seated, the crowd diffused (popular place). You order it (right side), pay for it (left side), and take your seats; someone will bring it to you when it's ready (toasted and warmed). Coffee and drinks (free refills) are located to the left of the restaurant, facing UNLV and Maryland Parkway. Clean location. There were three people working here. Bathrooms are toward the other entrance/exit doors. Upon entering (to your right), there is an adjoining door to Wells Fargo Bank. This location has been here a while (located in an ever-changing strip mall); strategic placement across from the university ensures a steady customer base."}
{"text":"Look, I gave this store best 2 out of 3 tries and like an idiot I went back for a 3rd time.

It is on very rare occasion, if ever, I take the time to voice negative comments or experiences, knowing people don't take the proper time to write positive ones.

However, after Today, where, I arrived at 10:05 to this store and was finally able to walk out with 1 single bagel at 10:45 I'm done.

And this is by no means the first time it's happened. I also purchased a small coffee,  after waiting in a solid line for 20mins altogether thru 3 separate line and finally paying, I went on to fill up my regular coffee cup, finding only empty carraffes, every single one empty..except decaf, really?

 I can't even get the coffee I just paid for while I wait another 20mins..? and don't mention trying to get any staff attn.

Then we all get to stand amongst each other., annoyed and waiting. reality is 15mins passing.. waiting- turns into 20.., and when we leave- your customers  leave in a huff. If I hadnt of spent so much time waiting I wudve just gotten my money back. It's not worth It,I live down the street, I cud buy and prepare bagels on my own time in 40 mins. 

 Jobs not being done properly otherwise every visit I wouldn't see free food being given away as a type of compensation to smooth over the bad experience Every time. But your service staff and order of this store is embarrassing. Not only is the staff completely disorganized in there production, they are also not nice friendly. It's clearly a hassle for them to put an egg or schmear between two pieces of dense bread. The only thing consistent about this store is the terrible service. Your store seriously needs sum attention. there's no excuse for a 30 to 40 min regular wait for a bagel with self serve coffee. I almost wrote a review after the last visit but disregarded it due to the rush, but clearly it wasn't a rush-your staff is so NOT in a rush, that they are Always in the weeds. 

There are plenty of other great Einstein's that take care of business! Don't come here. They don't deserve u!"}
{"text":"Bacon and cheddar cheese breakfast sandwich yum!! Staff is friendly and got my order in a timely manner"}
{"text":"At only 10 am on a Saturday they're out of all their featured bagels and when I asked to if I could wait for one, the girl said she would t be making anymore. I came specifically for the featured Mac n cheese bagel so just pretty disappointed, it's not like they're about to close. This was my first visit to einsteins ever"}
{"text":"Always been a fav stop this location as I lived very near in past. I usually stop in for coffee n bagel. Always great selection and service here. Thanks folks. Well done."}
{"text":"In general, I like Einstein Bros Bagels. Not the best food in the world, certainly not the worst. This location has been a quick breakfast stop for the wife and I since we moved to this part of town. I haven't had any problems with the quality of food at this location, but literally every time I go into this store, the same people are working, and they are always grumpy. It doesn't matter if its busy or slow, they are grumpy and running around like they have their heads cut off. 
Like I said, I've not had a problem with the food, but the service isn't up to snuff because of the attitudes of the staff. I can't say I won't come back, because I know I will, some days start better with a Spicy Elmo and a cup of their Fair Trade coffee...but if I can find another quick breakfast spot in the area, I will be a happy man."}
{"text":"This location just plain sucks! They never have a proper stock of anything and the staff always look like lazy slobs. 

No matter when I have come in, same story. This morning at 7:45am, no muffins and a number of bagle types are gone. 

I'll stick with the Cheyenne location."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood location with an adequate seating area. The menu is the standard Einstein menu however I had a Thintastic egg sandwich and it was prepared very well (looked like the picture on the menu board). Restaurant was clean but he men's room could have used a good scrubbing. Good coffee is an Einstein plus."}
{"text":"I like this location, sometimes busy but always gets my order right. They always greet and are very friendly. I would give it a chance regards previous comments."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed with the service at this location. Stopped by with twenty minutes to spare before work and there were two employees working. I ordered with hopes that it would go quickly when a woman walked in and went straight to the register and made the employee start cutting bagels for four boxes. Left feeling hungry since I skipped breakfast in hopes for a delicious bagel."}
{"text":"Its good. i love their Spinach florentine bagel with the garlic herb smear. And thei chai tea latte hot/cold is yummy! :)"}
{"text":"I really love sandwiches and beagles, but this place has really ruined the thought of it for me.  Besides it being overpriced, the sandwiches are either overdressed with a spread or has too much veggies and not enough meat! Don't get me wrong I love veggies, but meat needs to balance out the flavor in my mouth.  I'm not a vegan for goodness sakes!"}
{"text":"I had good service at 10:26a. There was a line but my bagel came out quicker than I could get my coffee cup full and set up. It can get full here but it was empty when I came in. There isn't a variety of bagels all the time, which sucks, but whatever. It's better than the one at UNLV where they're slower than the traffic on Maryland right now."}
{"text":"Always a great place to grab a bagel and coffee before school at UNLV. Try the bagel turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"I am sad this place has such average reviews! I am a frequent Einstein Bros customer, and come to this particular location at least once a week. It's a great place to have an inexpensive, yet quality breakfast. I even see students hang out here to do homework. 

A variety of bagel selections, flavors, and shmears. Even creative ones too! They are not limited to the simple bagel-and-cream cheese. You can also get lox (salmon), bagel sandwiches, and they have cookies and muffins in their display as well. Must I also mention Nutella is a choice of spread?!

Customer service is always spot on. The people working are very helpful and patient (goes a long way in coffee shops with intricate/extensive orders). Be sure to order a cup of coffee and try their freshly brewed Vanilla Hazelnut. MmMmmmmm, so good!!

If it is your first time at an Einstein Bros, be aware they take your order ONLY at the first order station, then you have to make your way down to the cash wrap at the opposite end and pay there. It seems from reviews this confuses/pisses a lot of people off lol."}
{"text":"Came in around 11:30 and unfortunately they were out of my main choices for bagels including everything, dutch apple and six cheese. but the general manager seemed to be working really hard. He made my food which consisted of a pepperoni pizza bagel on asiago and a spinach bacon breakfast panini. He was quick to bring out my order all the way to my table! This place is close to my home so I'll probably be back again."}
{"text":"Delish breakfast bagel deal. Get the farm house with a green chili bagel. It's beyond amazing."}
{"text":"I just tried their sandwiches for the 1st time.

A turkey on marbled rye california style with avocado,sprouts,pickles and more.

The bread was not toasted and was crumbly, the turkey was kinda lame like carl budding's in the pkg for $.40 at the grocery.

for $9 it was not very impressive.

I will stick to the bagels & schmear and the breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"I had to stop at the Chase and when I saw Einstein Bagels I had to stop in for lunch. My bagel sandwich was AWESOME!!! But the iced tea tastes as if it were brewed with coffee... So gross when that's not the flavor you were expecting. Glad I wasted over two bucks for something that's going down the drain. NOT!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is not.  Called three times to order food for pickup and no one answered.  With five employees working it made no sense."}
{"text":"Products good. Staff not so good. They don't know their products and not friendly. She also didn't understand what an open faced bagel was although they sell it like that."}
{"text":"After a long dry run of not desiring bagels I was out and about this morning very early without having had anything to eat. By the time I got around to listening to my stomach talk to me for an hour I decided I better feed it and I decided on a bagel.

Now, my first review of Einstein's was not very good because they tend to tick me off with the amount of spread they put on their bagels. It is also super corporatized and I feel like a \"cog in the machine\" when I get bagels here. But I digress - I keep coming back out of habit and probably laziness in finding a better bagel place.

Today I was much happier with my meal. It was simple: regular coffee, jalapeno bagel (toasted), with plain spread on the side. My order came out fast, even though the line was long and the coffee was piping hot and good.

Einstein's gets a kick up to A-OK for me. I'm not saying I'm a fan though."}
{"text":"For a couple years this was the closest places to get a decent bagel while I was working in the area. Just a hop on the freeway and one exit over and I could be here if some mid-morning muchies hit me during my week day.

It is in a convenient location and I never had a problem getting in and out quickly.

Einstein's may not be THE best bagels in the world, since they are a chain, but the options are, of course, varied and delightful. Their coffee is not bad either. 

Overall I will return when a bagel fix hits me."}
{"text":"Thank God, it wasn't busy because the service was so slow.  Manager was not impressive, she ignored that I was standing in front of the register and helped the next person in line then when that customer insisted I go first she acted like it was such a big deal to delete part of the previous customers order.  She actually glared at me?!  

Bagels were stale and blah as usual.  I hate coming here and I only come here to satisfy my kids.  

This store also doesn't deliver the bagels to your table.  They acted like I was self entitled when I raised hand at my table after my name was called.  Another glare from the manager followed by a \"there is no way in hell l'm delivering these to your table look\".  

Awesome!"}
{"text":"The locks on this bagel look old, and it doesn't even cover the whole bagel. The service is horrible and the employees are rude. This place is a rip off."}
{"text":"decided to stop off here for a change of pace from donuts

I do like the selection of bagels Einstein offers, and they are pretty good
I only rated the place 2 stars because of the workers

I went in around 8am, so well after the morning office rush, so the place was not busy at all.
There were 2 girls behind the counter for ordering, neither acknowledged me even being there?
Like they were real busy??? doing what???? so I asked one of them, who seemed to be bothered for a few different bagels....I should have apologized for making her actually do a bit of work....b*tch.

so after making my selection, I went to the cashier.  Now this numbnuts was busy doing something on his CELL PHONE, and didn't look up til he was done.  GEE, sorry for being such a bother guy, but I just wanted to pay??? Joked with him about the dog bagels at the register too....zero sense of humor.

Nothing worse that poor/bad customer service.  Even a decent product will not overcome such rudeness.  Definitely will not return to this location, will just stick to Ronald's Donuts from now on!!!!"}
{"text":"Try their French toast bagels Uhh-may-zing! Jordan and Shalinda are always ready they know exactly what I want. Clean, fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm off during the week days I like to treat myself to some delicious coffee from Einsteins along with a Nova Lox bagel. On this most recent visit, this particular location was out of Lox so they improvised and used some of the retail stuff instead. It was a nice gesture, but just didn't quite taste the same.

The salmon was a little bit too much portion wise for me and the cream cheese was pretty skimpy. I felt the ingredients just didn't mesh together like they normally do. The service though was great, super friendly workers and relatively quick."}
{"text":"Man, this place is strange to me. 

First of all, they have a ton of different kinds of bagels. Bagels with toppings, with things in them, in sandwich form... whatever. And they're all good, sure. AND they have like 20 different kinds of cream cheese. All Wins, right? So why is this place three stars? 

Price. It just doesn't make sense to me that I could order a regular bagel, a bagel that has stuff like a sandwich, and two drinks and spend $15. That seems pricey to me considering the food was good, but not $15 good. 

I'll probably come back to this place again, but it won't be my first choice for eating in the area."}
{"text":"Why is this place always so disorganized?  This time I was overcharged and the guy who delivered the sandwich to the table brought it to my attention and fixed it!

They never have a full selection of bagels and run out too soon...this hurts their revenue.

All the employees need training at their locations."}
{"text":"Not happy at all with the service! They are under staffed and always run low on bagels. Huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"They need more employees. After waiting 16 minutes for a toasted bagel,I had t get a refund to be at work on time.  The Customer in front of me also demanded a refund.  One employee was cooking for the whole morning rush crowd. This is nothing new at the location.  Awful service!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service and efficiency.  Enjoy coming here for breakfast occasionally and Marquez is very helpful and friendly, appreciate this place"}
{"text":"Honestly food's alright but the service here is not so great. I don't think it's polite for employees to see that a person is standing waiting to order and still go about talking to each other about their weekend. They saw me and continued to talk, make me wait, then ask rudely what I wanted. Names? Not sure but today is May 25th, 2015. Time is 12:40pm. One male one female."}
{"text":"It doesn't take Einstein to realize that $5.12 is a good deal for a bottomless small cup of coffee and toasted bagel with salmon schmear. It just takes an average Joe that is up for a cup of coffee and a bagel to snack on to realize that. I am one of the average Joe's to realize it. 

  Throughout the years when I had been in the vicinity of UNLV, I have sometimes stopped in this Einstein Brothers Bagels. The times that I have stopped here were when I was in the mood for both coffee and a bagel. The major advantage that this Einstein Brothers Bagels has over their closest competitors Starbuck's and Coffee Bean are bagels. This is an advantage that has sometimes caused me to chose Einstein Brothers Bagels over their nearest competitors. 

  Being that it is directly across Maryland Parkway from the UNLV Student Union, it is surprising that their parking lot never fills up. However, it is not surprising that the bagel case never fills up. So where I rarely have a problem finding a parking space outside, I sometimes have a problem finding the bagel that I want inside. And today was one of those days where they were out of poppyseed and sesame bagels. Apparently Einstein is not a genius at managing?

  Speaking of managing, the ordering system has been different from the other Einstein Brothers Bagels that I have visited. The usual protocol when ordering here is that you order at the right of the counter then move past the bagel case to the register to pay. Here, I have ordered and paid at the left of the bagel case. Usually the employee that I pay has been a nice and overworked woman. 

  This is a relatively large location where I never had a problem finding a table unlike Sunset at Stephanie or Blue Diamond at Dean Martin. When I walk with my cup to the coffee there are no worries over somebody trying to take my seat. On account of the fact that it is not overly busy and that coffee refills are complimentary this is an ideal spot to relax. As far as coffee goes, Einstein Brothers holds their own. If you put me in a blind taste test, the reality is that I wouldn't be able to differentiate this from Starbuck's or Coffee Bean. You would not need to put me in a blind taste test for me to say that I like Einstein Brothers Coffee over Mothership. Now that I reviewed their coffee what about their bagels? For purposes of making this review easier to read, I will discuss this in the following paragraph. 

  When it comes to coffee, Einstein Brothers faces intense competition in the Maryland Parkway UNLV corridor. However, when it comes to bagels, it is a totally different situation. In my opinion, Las Vegas is short of bagel shops. From Centennial Hills to Boulder City they are too far and few between. Although, Einstein Brothers only survived in the bagel rich New York City market for a couple of months because they couldn't compete, in Las Vegas they are a major player in the bagel market. The closest mom and pop competitor to this location is Harry's Bagelmania. In my opinion Einstein Brothers is just as good and more reasonably priced. I rate an Einstein Brothers bagel three stars. 

  I am certainly no Einstein. However, when it comes to bottomless coffee and a bagel sandwich, I have enough brains to stop at Einstein."}
{"text":"On my way to Springs Preserve, I was about to stop off at Starbuck's for my caffeine fix. When I saw the sign for Einstein Bagels, I passed over Starbuck's.

  The fact that I passed over Starbuck's for Einstein Bagels is testimony that their coffee and value is better. For $2 more than Starbuck's, I brought bottomless coffee and a toasted bagel with cream cheese. Let me say that Einstein Bagel's Coffee is underrated. If I was to come up with a list of underrated places, Einstein Bagel's coffee would be on it. There were four blends of coffee, including Autumn Blend, Neighborhood blend, and decaf. I know that the  coffee is good when I pass over mixing in flavored syrup to add flavor to it. Regardless they fall short of the goodness of New York bagels, they come close. By the way, I recommend the toasted blueberry bagel.

    Whereas Einstein Bagels is a great value when you order a bagel with coffee, the value factor decreases when you order higher priced items. My complaint about Einstein Bagels, which I addressed in previous reviews, is not including a side item such as potato chips or potato salad with the sandwich. I believe that their customer base would grow if they included a side item.

   I have a mixed opinion as far as service. The employees were friendly at  the same time that it seemed understaffed. One employee juggling the order line and register line resulted in an extended line. Eventually the manager would help out at the order line. If I had an important place to be, it is strong possibility I would've walked over to Starbuck's.

   Because the lobby is large with lots of tables and windows, it is an inviting place to relax with a coffee and bagel. The noise level is average.

  I am not loyal to one bagel establishment. My mood will determine if I return to this location if I am in the vicinity of Decatur at Sahara."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat bagels but they brought back their green chili one. There is not a better excuse to have an egg sandwich! This cheesy wonder filled my craving for an excellent breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is located in the SEB building. Its best to go during class & not during pass time cos it gets SUPER busy. The wait time depends on how long the line is but usually if the line is short, they get your stuff out to you pretty quickly! 

Some employees are pretty cool, but others can be rude at times. It's really hit or miss. 

I always get an Asiago bagel with light jalapeño salsa cream cheese! It's delicious!! I get it light cos if you don't say light... They practically dump half of the tub of cream cheese in there."}
{"text":"Just updating, this location does not have a drive thru. My interaction and opinion has stayed the same though."}
{"text":"It's no surprise that the bagels and shmears are wonderful. This location is the closest to my parents' house and my mom loves Einstein Bros. bagels, so this is where we visit. The interior is very nice and cozy. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I love the selection of bagel flavors (Everything, Potato, Asiago Cheese, and Sesame Seed are some of my favorites) and the reduced-fat whipped shmears are so, so good (Sun-Dried Tomato Basil, Garlic & Herb, Onion & Chive are my go-to flavors, but they're really all delicious except the Smoked Salmon). During the fall, they have delicious offerings like Pumpkin Walnut Gourmet Bagel and Pumpkin Shmear (YUM!), adding to the fun. Get the baker's dozen box, which comes with two shmears, and freeze some for later. Also, don't forget to ask for a stamp card and have them slice your bagels!"}
{"text":"One of the worst customer services places I have ever been. 

Granted, the bagels are consistent & delicious. But, customer service is so much more important, no matter how delicious the bagels are. The manager was counting her drawer when I walked in. I understand as a manager things have to get done. But, I was waiting 10 minutes for my bagel. One single bagel. I waited for as long as I could before I had to go to work. 

It may not matter to them because they're just working the job, but they did just lose a customer."}
{"text":"Delicious warmed up bagels of every kind for a decent price. The blueberry nutella bagels are my top favorite. Also, the orange juice is always fresh with two sizes available I love it. Einstein Bros is by far my ideal place to visit every morning after my morning run."}
{"text":"I love Einstein's bagels. The bagels themselves are amazing. (When I get the ones I actually ordered made correctly)

This location though? Not as impressive as the bagels. The length of time it takes to get an order is ridiculous, the accuracy of the orders are a 50/50 chance & workers aren't the warmest people. Everyone seems to be pretty miserable working there. 

The only reason I gave the 2 stars was for the bagel themselves."}
{"text":"Yummy.  The bagels are ALWAYS fresh and soft.  There is a huge variety (the \"everything\" bagel is the best) and the prices are moderate.  You get a baker's dozen, and they will offer to toast and/or pre-slice them for you!  SWEET!
At my house, they never make it past the first day.  But I've managed to hide a bagel and it stayed fresh and soft for at least a day and a half.
My only complaint, if you could call it that, is that because they are soooo soft, they get smushed in the bag.  OY.  To complain is human.

BONUS: The servers are friendly and its right next to a Starbucks!!!"}
{"text":"I popped into Einstein Bros today to pick up an everything bagel with schmear. I was greeted with a polite good morning by an employee cleaning the dining room, and Andrew ( who took my order) made my day by joking with me and being very friendly. My bagel was ready in less than a minute and tasted so delicious!! My only complaint is that adding schmear is more than the cost of the bagel."}
{"text":"I come here after my morning classes quite a bit and found myself to always ordering a plain toasted bagel with mustard or a bacon/cheese/egg sandwich or most of the time now, a cheese or pepperoni pizza bagel. The workers are always smiling and kind. The environment makes me feel safe and I can enjoy my food while watching shows on my computer."}
{"text":"Another loss for Einstein. Waiting 20 minutes for a bagel- really? The bagels are already cooked, right? I thought the other location I go to was the only bad one. They need more staff for their busy times. It's not that good here to wait this long! They really need to get their act together."}
{"text":"Chronic ISSUES for YEARS! Out of coffee always, rude staff always, wrong order always and all the other concerns below. PLEASE READ ONE STAR REVIEWS BELOW!!! Called customer service and they argued with me. Obvious why they have problems.  $7 for a small coffee and a bagel that was messed up (paid for item that was missing) and out of coffee that was paid for. I agree with review below, This STORE should be CLOSED!"}
{"text":"It may not be a 5-star restaurant, but it's definitely a 5-star Einstein's. And 4,700% faster, friendlier and more organized than the Maryland location. You've won me over, Decatur. And long last, my first Yelp review. Broke the seal. Carpe Shmear'em."}
{"text":"NO! Do you want a bagel? Do you really want one? Ok, since you insist, there is a trader joes, a fry's and a Walmart nearby.
Pick one of those places and buy yourself some bagels. 
Just don't come here, they don't deserve you.

The service will be horrible. They will take a long time to take your order, even longer to make your food, and you will stand there waiting for your food wondering how there can be 6 employees behind the line with no other orders ahead of you and it's been 15 minutes and you still have no food.

Once you finally receive your food, you will leave ASAP because you can't stand the incompetence and also you want to eat in a place that does not look like a high school cafeteria after a food fight.

When you get home, your order will be wrong. You have been warned."}
{"text":"My food was served on a tray that had someone's old food order underneath the paper. This, after waiting 20 minutes for our order. Not coming back."}
{"text":"October 2015

I decided to pick up a grab and go box of bagels for my co-workers.  I arrived with plenty of time to spare before needing to clock in at work, but there are no grab and go boxes at 7am.  Okay,fine - so I get in line.  There are 3 guys working but one is the only cashier, one is taking orders, and the other appears to be working in the back.  There is now a line for bagels and the person taking orders doesn't appear to be motivated to work quicker then a snail.  After waiting for the one person in front of me, I request a box of bagels to be informed that I will have to build one.  Fine.  I decide on them as fast as I can because i need to get to work.  I get my box, my cream cheese,and now I am waiting in line again for 2 individuals in front of me and another person trying to cut the line to get another cup of coffee - which he was able to do since the cashier appeared to be having issues with his machine or he wasn't trained properly, I don't know.  This excursion that should have only taken 10 minutes tops, took double the time.  I was late to work, and I will never go to this establishment again.  There is a much better Einsteins Bagels on Val Vista which is kinda out of my way to work but apparently worth it since these guys couldn't get their act together on a work day during the prime morning rush.  And looking at the reviews from over a year ago, things haven't improved."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service!! They can never seem to get a order right. Someday a u go in an they stand to the register way to the left, then they call u all the way down an ask what can I get for u. Then have to walk back to the bagel counter to tell them the flavor bagels I want. They always look like its a pain in the ass to come to the bagels to get my order. Like I know all 12 ones I want at the register!! Then some days it's the register in the right side of place. An we the customers are always the idiots. I waited 15 mins for a bagel wit smear. Only to get to my car an realize they forgot the smear. Wen I asked if I could get the smear I paid for I got the look. Then as leaving I got the smart ass comment \"your welcome sir!\" Like I should thank u for screwing up my order again! This place is so badly mismanaged an it's all Unlv kids working so I have gotten use to horrible service at places near the university."}
{"text":"I've NEVER had good service at this Einstien's! Today, I waited 17 minutes for one sandwich and they weren't even busy! They truly just don't have they're crap together at this location. It's always the same people and they're consistently having a great time chatting one another up and NOT working. Not only did I wait a stupid amount of time, but they didn't even offer sympathy. So many mornings starting off the wrong way by these employees. People who serve coffee should be the most polite in the biz because they know us addicts are CRAZY before we get it. Mic drop."}
{"text":"I like this location. It is right near CVS and Sprouts which I like to go to, so I have been here twice. Both times I had a great experience. 

Staff: They are very friendly here. I have been here twice and they are quick to greet you.

Service: This is a self-service place, so you kind of serve yourself. Both times I have been here though, they have brought my food to me rather than calling my name. Nice staff! 

Food: Really good. Its a chain, so its consistent with the other brands.The coffee and iced tea seemed fresh here."}
{"text":"My favorite bagel shop in the area. It can get hectic on weekend mornings, but no more than other bagel shops in the area. The quality is great, and the keep the place clean. I keep coming back. 

They also take pre-orders. Want a half dozen for home or want to make sure your one favorite will be there for breakfast? Call before you drive over, and they'll have a fresh batch waiting."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Einstein. Eat at the north west location on Durango often. This is the first time I've gone to this location. My husband and I experienced the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. First, the girl behind the counter, Adrianna, tapped her fingers on the counter to get me to hurry up. Didn't even greet me. I said \"hello, can I get the half dozen, just assorted, please\" she said \"yes\" like I was inconveniencing her, and then walked away without a word. I waited for a few minutes until I was helped by someone else. Adriana was waiting at the counter, snatched my card out of my hand. Then, my husband later went in to get another half dozen. He was helped by a different girl, who's name I unfortunately did not get. She yelled out \"Phil, your bagels are done\" and the man behind my husband informed her he was Phil but that he hadn't ordered a half dozen. So she very rudely said \"well whoever you are, rolled her eyes and pushed the angels towards him. She was extremely rude behind the counter while again snatching his card out of his hand and throwing it across the counter at him. I will not be back to that location & I will be phoning the manager tomorrow."}
{"text":"i was in town to visit a friend and we came here to eat a light breakfast. 

i ordered a asiago bagel with plain cream cheese and tomato.. toasted! service was friendly and quick. my bagel was really fresh and was toasted nicely. they put the perfect amount of cream cheese and the tomatoes were not too thin or thick. it was the ideal breakfast for me. 

this location is convenient because it has tons of parking and there are other places to check out in the area. i haven't been back in a year so i'm not sure what locals would consider new here but everything is clean and pretty at this location."}
{"text":"Came here around 1pm to catch a late breakfast with a family of 5. They didn't have much variety left in terms of bagels and to top it off the didn't have anymore eggs. They said they needed to make more which would be a 45 minute wait and well that's just not acceptable. For these two reasons I can't in good conscious give this location anything higher than 3 stars. The 3 stars are mainly for the staff being friendly and accommodating  and the cleanliness of the dining area."}
{"text":"I so want to like this place. It's in a perfect location, prices are reasonable, food quality is good; but the customer service is bad beyond belief. The people are friendly, but don't seem to understand that servicing the customer is job one. I've waited for 3 or 4 minutes at the counter waiting for someone to take my order. Likewise, I've waited the same time for someone to show up to take my money. Come on guys, it isn't that tough to cross train your employees and have them flex into work stations as people come and go."}
{"text":"I was going to a meet up in this area and ducked in to get a quick bite to eat.  Einstein's orange juice is always delicious and I noticed every customer that came in after me that at least one person in each party purchased an OJ!  The bagel selection is vast.  The register operator was very nice and the other staff member was quiet but attentive to preparing orders.  It was well kept but had the appearance of older furnishings.  Maybe a remodel is in order to liven up the atmosphere (including the restroom).  The food I ordered was good.  So, the food receives three stars and the OJ five, rounding it to four stars!"}
{"text":"The cashier (Middle aged african woman) is rude and condescending.  I asked  questions regarding obtaining a bigger box for couple dozen of pastries and bagels that I was purchasing, but her remarks were unnecessarily rude.  She was not welcoming nor helpful or accommodating like the other einstein bagels I've been to.  Never again will I purchase nor recommend anyone to give this location more business."}
{"text":"I love Einstein Bagels and I like the deals that they have on Mondays, however the customer service is lacking. I would only order from one particular lady that I have seen who is always friendly if I could, have not caught her name. Went in today with my nine month old and had a grumpy gentleman help me with my bagel order. Anytime I said something or ask a question I was cut off with the answer, the least you can do is wait for me to finish talking. I went in at around 9:15 a.m. and they were out of a quite a few things already. It doesn't matter what time I go in it seems they are always out of something. I would think that they would anticipate what to make or what to have out by now. So as to not run out of things by 9 a.m."}
{"text":"Frequently out of multiple bagel flavors. Consistently extremely slow service. Apathetic, unhelpful and sometimes rude staff. Untidy customer area. A disappointing experience in all. Not good enough, Einstein Bros. I love these bagels but not this location."}
{"text":"For being in such a prime location you would think this place would be more welcoming. I don't think there's much supervision at this location as the floors are dirty and the patio is a constant reck every time I come here. Customer service and the food is pretty good but just clean the place up it'll go a long way."}
{"text":"I walked into this Einstein Bros. Bagels approached the counter to order and was completely ignored by all 4 employees. The employees scattered and argued about who would take my order, none of them did, and several others continued cleaning in the back. I waited approximately 15 minutes and decided to walk out prior to ordering. Bad, bad, bad, customer service. Not to mention over priced product and based on the menu board a limited selection. I wouldn't waste time on this location."}
{"text":"This Einstein brothers has the rudest people working. No one knows how to smile. We weren't greeted and everyone seemed like they hate their job. I love Einstein brothers but I will not return to this one."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've been here. Although they fixed the mistakes they made, there were several. It would have been better if they didn't MAKE the mistakes in the first place, though.
 They are all very pleasant. Everyone seems to enjoy working there, which matters to me as a customer.
 The drinks were good, hot, fresh, accurate. The Asparagus, cheese egg white thingy that I preferred with real eggs instead of whites, they forgot, remade it, then forgot the added cream cheese I already paid for. I gave up and just ate it. It was tasty, would have been really good with the cream cheese I paid for though.  :/"}
{"text":"3.5
for an egg sandwich bagel the prices are a tad steep. ~$4.50
they are good but nothing special.
the egg is really thing and the sandwich is a really small portion.

but i liked my egg, cheddar, ham on jalapeno bagel.
it wasn't too salty.
the bagel was chewy, just the way i like it."}
{"text":"Need a quiet place to study away from the hustle and bustle of the SU?! Einstein Bros is probably your place then! 

Usually running rampant with science nerds and coffee lovers, EB is definitely a place to chillax and study without running into annoying talkers..or people who laugh too obnoxiously! 

Honestly, it is a good place to grab a blueberry muffin and a coffee; and then sit down and study with your laptop. I'll admit, their coffee is not the greatest..and neither is their food. Yet, you have to remember: You grabbed CAMPUS FOOD!!!! On-campus food is usually never better than it's \"out of campus\" counterparts! (Let's be honest.) 

But their blueberry muffins are one of the best nearby, I recommend that! 

Also, their service is pretty good. I have never had a bad experience because they treat their customers pretty well! 

HUGE TIP: Learn to share your table with strangers; it's college! :)"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin....? 
I saw they were a little busy this morning and I'm a very patient person. I worked in the industry so I know how crazy it's gets when your slammed. Also, it didn't look like there was enough employees for the morning shift which is totally a bad call on managements part. That being said, I wouldn't be that upset if my order took an hour or two as long as it came out. I ordered a breakfast bagel of some kind, something spicy. I saw to-go orders and for here orders coming out pretty steady. Then I saw people who came after me...they received their order before me. Mind you, I'm already 5 minutes late for work. I've been waiting for almost 30 minutes for one bagel and finally I ask what's taking so long. They didn't even make my bagel yet. Yes they apologized which was nice but when I reminded them it too 2 minutes to make. Man oh man. I won't be coming back again. Bet that"}
{"text":"I love their bagel sandwiches here especially for breakfast.  Their coffee is to thin and I don't really care for it.  Their service is always very very nice."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels, no doubt. The service can be spotty. I ordered my favorite Nova lox plate. When it came out with a crappy tomato, too thick of cut onions, and no Capers to be seen, I mentioned it to the manager here and he brought me more tomatoes and a lot of Capers. So that was nice but it's disappointing when the person making the food doesn't really care about the quality of work. The restaurant is really slow today so there's really no excuse and it's a busy lunch rush. Coffee here is great and very nicely priced especially considering it's right next door to a Starbucks or you can't hear yourself think let alone plug your laptop them. There is free WiFi so it is a great place to work remotely."}
{"text":"Luke warm coffee at 3 pm... nice staff. I guess it's to be expected. Didn't have the bagel i want by this time."}
{"text":"Where do I start order 4bagels plain to go keep me waiting for 45min and the lady from the counter ask me if I need something wtf I told her I'm waiting for bagels and my order is on the counter top that they forget not even a busy day tell me about busy when you at Los Angeles bagel shop incompetent workers never coming back on this shit hole"}
{"text":"Never go on a busy morning!  We went on a Saturday at 9:30 am and they were out of a lot of bagels, all 4 coffee dispensers were empty and it took 15 minutes to get our food to go... after ordering!  It was a cluster! They gave our food to someone else and it took 5 minutes for the lady to make an iced coffee.. from the menu, not customized.  

The food was fine, but this quick service restaurant was in the weeds and super slow."}
{"text":"Dirty counters , crumbs all over & the slowest workers ever ! You would think the manager would jump in and help sped things along when there are about 10 people waiting !!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of $5 pizza bagels on Friday! I also would recommend the Nova Lox bagel! I don't like the espresso drinks (too sugary for me) and I personally enjoy the vanilla hazelnut drip coffee. I was disappointed with the shmearfuls, not enough cream in the middle and you can tell they were frozen before. Would probably say cream cheese and a bagel are a safe bet. The wait is also very long, even when there isn't a rush. Love the people that work there, they're super nice!"}
{"text":"The sign on the outside says Einstein Bros Bagels but when you go inside there is not a bagel in sight. So, you ask the person behind the counter \"What's up with no bagels?\". Her response is:\"Be patient. They'll be out in about 40-45 minutes\". I say, let me speak to who ever is in charge. Her response is \"I am and I'm Tanya, the District Manager\". What???????????? You're running this place, you're the DM and you allow this to take place? The funniest part of all of this is that the guy who, actually, bakes the bagels is standing right next to her. What poor leadership and what a horrible place to eat. Tanya is not the only nasty employee there. Most of them are too. No bagels. Poor customer service. The lines are long (when there are bagels) because the person who takes the orders is the person who makes the orders is the person who takes payment for the orders. It's the same person doing everything, usually. Einstein Bros Bagels, sayonara. You've lost me as a customer. Bagel Cafe, only about one mile away, here I come. Better bagels and customer service there. It's worth the ride, trust me. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok food. This location is not very clean. Dirty soda fountain, dirty bathrooms, dirty floors, the place needs a deep cleaning and a more detail oriented  staff"}
{"text":"I stopped in for some bagels for a meeting. The service was very friendly, and the lovely lady taking orders was super friendly. I received good quality food and quick service on this visit"}
{"text":"I received excellent service on this visit, and my service was quick. However I could tell that there were issues with the staff being unhappy and several were upset with stated management issues. There needs to be adjustment to management"}
{"text":"I love bagels.  I happened to go into Einstein Bro's because I was in Vegas to party and had to go to the bank (which happened to be right next to the bagel shop).
I sent a friend in to get me an Onion bagel and he came out with a Plain because he said the onion bagels weren't ready.  
I thought to myself \"they weren't ready, whatever!!\"
So i contently took a bite of my plain bagel and realized why the Onion bagels weren't ready...its because they bake their bagels FRESH DAILY!!
The bagel that was consuming (like it was my last meal) was the best bagel I had ever had.  The crispyness of the edges (toasted) to the soft inside and covered with a generous amount of cream cheese! WOW!
Need I say more.?
I was so impressed ..that I woke up early the next morning to grab another bagel before I headed back to LA!  THATS HOW DAMN GOOD THEIR BAGELS ARE!!!!"}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for plain buttered bagel. They trick to into paying before placing your order so you cannot walk away from the incredibly slow service. It was painful to wait that long. I was so mad and didn't even want to eat after. Shame on the managers for not Hiring more people. This place is pathetic."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took so long to get my order. Why it didn't come with anything on it, and why it tasted so bad. But it did. It was cheap though. So really I got what I paid for i guess."}
{"text":"Worst Einstein Bagels ever! Entire staff is rude and takes their sweet time. I left 45 minutes early and was still almost late. It's a bagel how hard can it be? The manager is also terrible, no one was ringing anyone out and someone verbally told her and she said okay and walked off without helping at all. Also they were out of a bunch of bagels and it was okay 11. I will never be back, I would rather drive far then deal with this trash ever again!"}
{"text":"Einstein's bagels is under rated. It seems their only downfall is no drive-thru window at any of their locations. But, they have quality-fair trade coffee at a reasonable price. If your looking for your fancy latte-frappicinos w/soy milk venti style- then GTFOH. This place is for fresh tasty bagels and simple roast coffee. Of course however they do offer light breakfast and lunch items, I absolutely LOVE their egg-white wheat toast veggie breakfast sandwiches (they have meat sandwiches also) freshly made, with asparagus and mushrooms, not the microwave heat up at Starbucks. So good! And light, low-calorie if that's what you're looking for. OR jump in and buy a delicious regular, fruit, seed, or veggie bagel. Their smears are all good. Coffee is served hot or iced, or if you prefer tea they have it. I believe you can get a variety of coffee blends but I've never had any. 

I drink my coffee black. No added sugar or creme. And the point is to serve good fresh coffee that tastes good. So Einsteins wins for me."}
{"text":"15 min and 8 bucks later a bland chicken pesto bagel, I've never had a pesto sauce that was that bland in my entire life! Chicken bland cheese bland even the tomato was bland , first time getting a sandwich from there 99% never again"}
{"text":"Love the variety. The Jalapeno and Choc. Chip bagels are delicious. Never more than a 3 min wait for my bagel. I've been in several times this week for breakfast. Love it."}
{"text":"I was in dire need of coffee, having to head back to LA, I needed something to hold me through for the long, boring drive through the desert.
Box of donuts from Pink Box next door, check, does Einstein have good coffee?
Well, they have coffee, good sure, but not great.
Hot, iced or frozen, I went with a large frozen mocha, my  husband the large frozen caramel macchiato, just over $4 each.
The ordering system is a bit counterproductive.
You order at the first register, step to the second, they repeat your order and you pay them?!!
The girl working must have never made coffee before as she kept asking the other one what to do next.
No chocolate on mine, no caramel  on my husbands.
Didn't feel like I really needed a squirt of syrup on top so I left mentioning anything.
Tasted fine, mine tasted pretty much just like coffee, his like like milk.
They were fine, got the job done, but I don't think I'd be back."}

{"text":"Customer service is nonexistent here.  Employees are not friendly at all.  Bagels were good, but not worth the lack I found personality from the employees.  Second visit w/ my family of 4.  Not a difficult order and not a busy time.  Next time we'll drive further to go to Bagel Nosh, Brueggers, or another Einstein on Val Vista where hopefully the employees will be less robotic."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this location there is a free show with breakfast. The first time I went two of the staff members were ready to \"throw down.\" 

Male employee: I just asked you a simple question
Female employee: Silence
Male employee: You know I'm really sick of your fu*kin' attitude. 
Female employee: You're the one with the attitude. I'm sick of yours
Male employee: You walk around here thinking you're better than me. I don't give f*ck.
Female employee: No, I don't give a fu*k. Why don't you shut your fu*kin mouth right now
Male employee: You know what? Why don't you shut it for me?

All of this is going on while they are schmear bagels and prepare drinks. I really thought they were going to fight in the café! 
The second time I went I jinxed myself and said, \"I hope there aren't any fights today.\"
Instead I got the Rhonda Rousey of Einstein bagels. Linda. You ever wonder why some of the meanest people have the most simplest and charming names? Doesn't that mean pretty in Spanish? Well Linda was a bi*ch! She had a blank stare on her face, and refused to be friendly. I didn't want her to be my best friend but not my enemy either! Her face was like Rousey's when she's in the cage and about to fight her opponent. Did she want to tap me out just for ordering a Power Protein Bar? WOW!
I ignored her and moved forward in the line. As I meditated on her behavior I wondered if she was the one that male employee was fighting with. Hey! Where was he?

\"She's not very nice.\" The lady behind me said to her husband. Well good. At least I wasn't the only one who had noticed. The sweet elderly couple behind me ordered the Bagel box and every time the elderly lady said a type of bagel she wanted, Linda would grab the bagel and throw it into the box like a repetitive ball into a catchers mitt. CLUNK! Then without any expression, except \"I plan on tapping you out face\" she'd say, \"and what else?\" CLUNK!
WOW! The elderly couple kept repeating, \"She's not very nice.\" I could tell they were scared. The kind of scared where you're too damn old now to fight someone.

Finally when my order was ready one of the girls called my name, but another customer came up to the employee and asked for something. I kept saying while the employee held my bagel, \"That's mine! That's mine!\" But she continued to hold the bag. Another customer waiting intervened and said, \"Hey, you called her name. That's hers...\"
She gave me a dirty look like I was lying and reluctantly handed me my power bar. I snatched that bag out of her hand and shoved her right in her face. She fell down and started crying. I heard the crowd of customers gasp but it was too late. By then I was out for blood. I hopped over the counter and started going after Linda. I hoped she really new MMA because her ass was mine. I grabbed her hair and punched her in her face and---
Well...I snapped out of it. I woke up from my little daydream and took the bag from the rude employee muttering expletives under my breath. What's wrong with this staff? Thank God I fear jail."}

{"text":"While their coffee is fantastic and their bagels are good, the service could use improvement.  I've been a regular at this Einstein location for a year and a half now, since I moved back to the Southwest side of town.  Never once do they remember my face, name, or order preferences.  They're not even friendly.  They might as well greet customers with a, \"Neeext!\"  Furthermore, they are painfully slow at getting the orders through, but this was the price I was willing to pay for good coffee and bagels for a long time.  Lately I've been venturing out to try some of the independently owned coffee shops, such as Holley's Cuppa & Baguette Cafe, with wonderful experiences. 

If this happens to be on your way, I wouldn't discourage stopping, but certainly don't make a trek to seek this spot out."}
{"text":"Their smoothies are syrup not actual fruit, their orange juice is packaged to appear like it is fresh squeezed but it's just concentrate it appears to be misrepresentation,  the people there don't care about it, and their prices are equivalent to a high end place. I would suggest they charge McDonald's prices if they are give McDonald's quality"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and always out of product. I normally going in to get a French toast which they were out of for a third time.. I don't even order coffee here anymore because they either forget it or forget what to put in it..."}
{"text":"We come here all the time since this location is near us. We are in love with the  bagels however, the customer service is terrible every time we come it is the same thing there are several people behind the counter they act like we are bothering them when we enter in the store. It feels as if we just walked into someone's house without being invited. This is every time we come in. We punish ourselves by returning since we truly love their bagels."}
{"text":"I've never consistently received bad customer service from a place. 

I went there on 12/11 at 8am and ordered a large iced white chocolate mocha. There was no one else in the store. The three workers there literally just walked around for 15 minutes doing nothing, until I got up and asked for my coffee. The lady replied that she forgot. 

...but I'm the only one in the store. She makes it, then forgets to put white chocolate mocha in it. Then she says she forgot and thought I just ordered a coffee. The level of sheer Incompetence I just witnessed forced me to write a review. Awful."}
{"text":"Nice friendly service here! Been to a few Einsteins, not always greeted with warm enthusiastic employees, but this store everyone was nice. 

They will toast and slather your bagel of choice for around $2 if you pick the plain stuff, but if you want the seasonal, pumpkin, it's a little bit more. 

I have tried the lunch salads, they aren't always the freshest, but when they are their great. I haven't tried a bagel sandwich, spied a bacon, avocado one that looked yummy, will put that down on my list to try next trip."}
{"text":"Bagels are wonderful if made properly, the girl with long brown hair is a B****
they don't wash or use gloves after working with money,i've already called the health district on them, nvr will go back"}
{"text":"I usually get very good service, but when they are busy service is horrible! Took 30 min to order and 30 min to get the food which is good, but not worth the unpleasant attitude from the staff"}
{"text":"I like the food. The atmosphere is... non existent. It's just a dinky place whose management must figure that college kids don't care about the environment they eat in.  The staff are always friendly and service has always been decent enough  (just slow to clean the tables sometimes is all), so my main complaint is I don't particularly like the design of the place.  And it's not even a major complaint since it hasn't stopped me from going back for a solo meal from time to time."}
{"text":"This is a nice EinsteinBagel.  People listen to your order and they get it right not like the one on Flamingo and Rainbow. The cashier here on the Decatur location is friendly."}
{"text":"Go to fast breakfast! Not a huge fan of breakfast food but this place always hits the spot. They are quick and easy so you can get it in the go, clean friendly place to grab a bite to eat"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for fru-fru coffee and bagel sandwich's. I have yet to be disappointed by any location. Even when extreme bisy , the staff has always been friendly. The bagel selection is extremely good and I haven't had a bad bagel there. The orange juice is fresh daily and they make the coffee on the spot. Most of the people they have on coffee duty do it extremely well. Even when super busy, the service is fast. Stay frosty, Einstein's.

They also have happy hour from 3 to 5 so you know, half off bagels and drinks are kind of cool."}
{"text":"I stayed at the hotel right next to Einstein Bros and had breakfast there everyday. My bagels were always delicious (I tried a different one everyday). They have the basics but also \"gourmet\" options as well. I was hoping to grab lunch there one day too, but we were never around for lunch. Their menu looks really good though!  My husband also said their coffee was \"darn good\" as advertised =)  Staff was prompt and friendly. I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my mother, who is disabled. Candice waited on us and I have never seen anybody so patient in my whole entire life. My mom was acting so annoying and even I cringed. But Candice was patient and helped her with a smile. When I go to Vegas, I'll definitely be coming back here. Thanks, Candice!"}
{"text":"Einstein Bros. is located 5 minutes from my house and my son and I are fans.  I like it for the convenience and the Thin-tastic breakfast bagel sandwiches, which have egg whites, spinach, and asparagus on your choice of bagel.  Service here is always friendly and the wait is not long, even if there's a line.  The majority of customers always seem to be the senior crowd from Sun City; I think they congregate here at all hours.  You can usually find a newspaper that someone has left behind if you want to read one.  There are booths, a counter by the window, as well as outside seating.  For a quick meal, stop here."}
{"text":"Went here 3/12/11 while waiting for my rehearsal time at the UNLV theater across the street, with my sister. We were famished, had hours until we were going to be able to get home and grab some food. Naturally, nothing was open because Spring Break had just started so this place was basically our only option that morning. 

As somebody who isn't too hip on grains, and has a personal vendetta against bagels, I wasn't too excited to eat here. I was going to try some yogurt, but realized that it costs about the same as soup, so I grabbed that, after my sister ordered a bagel with cream cheese and chives. I wish I would have known prior to her ordering that my cup of broccoli cheddar soup came with a bagel so I didn't have to end up paying for the one she ordered. 

Anyway, we both got the asiago cheese bagel, which was decent. The soup, which was in a cup, was a sufficient amount but I wasn't raving over the flavor. For $7 and some change, we were tided over until we could get some protein from home."}
{"text":"Great coffe, great breakfast bagel. What's more to say. Service was quick. Will be back!

Yum yum!"}
{"text":"This is yet again another location of this chain that has poor service. The sad part is the district manager was siting in the lobby as they delivered the poor service. I think after all the bad experiences we had with Einstein's Bro's at numerous locations, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Went this morning 4-16-15 to grab some bagels for the office. 
I was panicking because I'd never been to this location before and I was hoping they were fast because I was almost late to work.  
Within 60 seconds I was heading out the door with an assortment of 13 bagels and 2 shmears.  They have boxes of them already made so all you have to do is pick out two cream cheeses and hit the road!  They even put napkins and knives in the box.  Genius. Plenty of friendly employees.  This is dangerous!!! I'll be going there all the time now! So I'll be broke :( but happy :) 
For $14.99 you get: 
-3 plain
-2 cinnamon raisin 
-2 honey whole wheat
-2 blueberry
-2 sesame
-2 asiago cheese
-2 shmears of your choice"}
{"text":"The staff at this location is absolutely amazing! I was greeted the moment I walked in. I am one of those customers with \"special requests\" and they did a great job at accommodating me. By that I mean I wanted an item on the menu modified. I got the chicken country salad sandwich but asked to have it made \"panini\" style. I think I made a great choice as I absolutely loved every detail about it. The manager there is super friendly and so was the cashier. I got there around closing time and they were very polite to inform me that they would be closing soon and didn't rush me out. I will be coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying 2 things: 1. I normally love Einsteins. 2. The food at this location is always very good. 

Now for the bad. I go there about twice a week, but no longer will. The last 5 visits, they have forgotten something in my order: Fruit yesterday, cookie last week - always something. Why ask if I want something if you are not going to include it? Just let me know you are going to take my money and give me nothing. Yes, I should have checked, but when they put a pickle in a paper bag, I assumed it was the cookie because I said \"No pickle\". There is one lady that never messes it up (I will update with her name, I forgot it), so if she is there, I will wait for her. If she is not there, I will leave. I realize that some of the employees do not speak English well and I don't speak Spanish, but when you repeat the order back to me correctly, I assume you understand it.

I never have an issue at any other location."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Einstein's Bagels now that I've tried them firsthand. Have always drove past but have never really tried them out. Decided to try this time and we weren't disappointed. 

I had the Honey Whole Wheat Bagel with Peanut Butter and wife had the Classic Applewood Bacon and Cheddar on a Plain Bagel. 

Staff was nice and friendly and the food was great. Will definitely visit here again in the future!"}
{"text":"Got my free birthday egg sandwich great customer service, will definitely be back if in the area and need a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"My bagels were delicious, yes I ate two at once.

One cinnamon sugar and one honey whole wheat. 
Both with their honey almond shmear. I wanted both toasted but only 1 came toasted. Still tasted great though. The cinnamon bagel was delicious I will definitely get it again if I go back.

I was there around 1 pm and it wasn't really busy but it sure felt like it because there was only 1 cashier and 1 girl for preparation. 

I felt bad for the girl who was preparing everything. She did absolutely amazing I would have been so frustrated if I were her.

They need to have more employees or at least a manager who monitors the flow and who is willing to lend a hand when things get overwhelming. It took about 20 minutes to get my two bagels.

Which kind of sucked honestly because I had a drive back to San Diego and I stopped there thinking I'll just grab a quick bagel it will only take a couple minutes.

I had a coupon which they honored which was awesome. Some places are difficult when customers use coupons. 

I hope they get more help just so things run smoother."}
{"text":"I came here early for breakfast, had a craving for the French toast bagel. Went there with my son on a Sunday morning around 8 am. I understand they're busy, and they are super short staffed. So I patiently wait, and then get our bagels. Twenty minutes, again I know it's busy but I can't believe myself I waited that long for a bagel. Then I get my French toast bagel and you can taste onions. Same with my sons bagel. Super disappointing."}
{"text":"Einstein's has six bagels for six bucks and playing Schmeer what a bargain. Great assortment both sweet and savory."}
{"text":"Such fresh bagels! I love the smears! A must for us when we arrive in Vegas early...we start our Vegas Vacation here with the best breakfast, a hot bagel and smear!!!!"}
{"text":"Bagels are mediocre. Employees don't know how to put cream cheese on the bagel, they cut the avocado in squares. Wouldn't recommend coming at all."}
{"text":"These places needs the heath department!!! Unsanitary and unorganized . One of the employee had dog or cat hair all over his shirt. Never changed his gloves while handling the register and food. I literally walked out, disgusting, Very inproper hygiene!!!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to a bagel craving, or just a change in food venues from the drab stuff at school, I usually head across the street to Einstein Bros bagels. The lines are only really busy during the early morning rush and lunch. If you go between those times, you should be ok!

Try a breakfast bagel if your there for breakfast. They are certainly my favorite."}
{"text":"Einstein Bagels is always a stop for me when visiting Vegas. The staff was friendly and very quick to serve us. I rated this a 4 simply because I look so forward to it and felt the Everything Bagel was a bit light in the pants with regards to seasoning. I will definitely be back though, as they typically produce an incredible bagel."}
{"text":"Walked in and out in less than 5 minutes, super fast morning service around 8:30 on a Wednesday; makes for a good start to the day with such a quick friendly quality experience."}
{"text":"As a certified carb addict, bagels are tops in my book. In need of a quick lunch option, this place is good for the most part. Food was standard, but like most restaurants in the UNLV area, they get packed and are slow as molasses as far as service."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my birthday to use an EB e-club coupon.  Got a breakfast bagel and a Pumpkin Crunch bagel w/ Pumpkin Schmear, which was really delicious.  Leo, the manager, was very friendly and made me feel welcome.  Service was quick too, but there weren't too many folks in there at 0700 on a Sat morn.  Wish EB had a branch closer to Nellis AFB!"}
{"text":"Bagels are OK! Manager or that dark skin lady such a B* second time I go in there and her attitude is horrible!! They messed up my order and I tell them and they get mad?"}
{"text":"The Einstein Bros bagel shop is always a winner for me. I want my pumpernickel bagel and they always have it! Add some of the Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice, and I am happy. As I come early (last time I was the first customer of the morning) I never meet a line and the staff is happy to see that someone showed up! So I seek this location out, off the strip, easy to get to, big parking, and of course the best, the number one Pumpernickel bagels!"}
{"text":"I am not a bagel connoisseur, but I do love their bagels. When I was living in LA, I used to frequent the Noah's Bagelry all the time- which is actually owned and run by the Einstein Bros group too. 

The bagels are always fresh, I love the selection of cream cheese flavors, and the thin bagel sandwiches for breakfast or lunch are now my new favorite, particularly the asparagus, mushroom, cheese, and egg whites.  Mmmm, mmm, good. I am a big fan of their iced green tea too (free refills). Whenever I eat from here, I always feel like it is a healthier alternative. 

This location is quite large, plenty of tables indoors and outdoors, and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"This place usually is awesome and their service is usually great, but today it was totally off. 

The girl at the register took 10 minutes to get to us because she had made a mistake. 

The second time we came back to get a coffee the girl who took our order did not hear the first 4 times we told her our order. Then when we paid the same girl at the cash register had another problem with another customer so again we waited while she fixed her mistake. 

Once we received our coffee we let the cashier know that it was supposed to have extra ice and she"}
