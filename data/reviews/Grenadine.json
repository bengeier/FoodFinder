{"text":"Recommended by a coworker as a hole in the wall kinda place. We ordered the chef surprise. Great price at $55 ( even if it wereUSD). It was more than enough food! The taste is great at a bistro level. The ingredients are fresh and like a farm to table concept. The only lacking is that the rabbit is dry and horse meat is tough (though I never had horse b4 so no comparison there) overall, I had a great experience. Can't beat the BYOB for sure!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite BYOB in Montreal. This restaurant is serious value for your money, the staff are very friendly and the tiny space creates a very cozy ambiance. If you're a vegetarian, it might not be worth it as the really specialty is the well prepared meat but they do always have veg-friendly options."}
{"text":"I came here once about 10 years ago, I remembered the food was excellent and it was very crowdy. Today, not so much, I was really disappointed. The food was so bland and even if there was a multitude of ingredients thrown in the plate and looked good, the flavours were lacking and there's nothing to excite the palate. We had the Guinea fowl leg and the salmon and both weren't worth the 30-35$ they were charging. There are so many better byob in Montreal today, competition is fierce. They do however, specialize in non conventional meat and poultry."}
{"text":"Good food, byow, good location in dowtown to get free parking (a plus!) the only thing I didnt like is the women who serveour table rushed us to leave...I guess the restaurant is popular.... -_-''"}
{"text":"Great place for an unpretentious, relaxed date or a dinner with friends. Delicious food, and BYOW. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is great. I've been there twice and took The \"menu de degustation\" both times which is a (cant remember how many services, 3 or 4) and both times my girlfriend took the same. What was interesting was that the food that we got was different so we shared and got a taste of almost everything on the menu, which I should add was delicious. The place is super cosy and charming and the service is really great.  Fantastic place to go on a date. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Greandine is one of the best byob's in the city. Their plates are generous, hearty and comforting, as well as original and well executed. The staff is ever so friendly, always trying to accommodate you and make your experience even more special. And it's a steal - great food at this price is hard to come by!"}
{"text":"Wow! What an outstanding place!!
I just came here with a group of 15 a couple days ago and had the most amazing experiance. The staff took such great care of us and were so accomodating! They were able to seat all of us together in one cozy corner of the small restaurant. With a large group, some very picky eaters (and 1 vegitarian) made me a bit nervous to make a reservation here but I'm so glad I did!! The food (and service) was out of this world, hands down the best meal we had while in Montreal (some saying it was the best food they'd ever eaten)!
At the end of the meal, the chef even called us cabs and the staff was able to split our check very easily for all to pay, which made the transition to our next location so much easier. The chef even sent us a kind message thanking us for coming in and hoping that we had enjoyed our night, which we absolutely did!! 
I'd recommend this place to anyone I know going to Montreal."}
{"text":"Choose the tasting menu and sit back for the ride through some delicious and inventive dishes that are generous and filling enough.  Not cheap, but you would pay double or more for this in NYC.  And bring your own bottle of something that pairs with a lot of different flavors and textures, like Pinot Noir or Beaujolais Cru."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here (in a cute, tucked away spot), and on two different occasions, had a delightful time with their surprise menu of the day. The food was seasonal, flavorful, complex, and spoke of culinary talent that didn't take themselves too seriously. I'll go back again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is a first- it's the first time I've given a restaurant a 5 star review.I think this is probably the most perfect dining spot I've been to in years. It's attractive and low key.The service was friendly but not obsequious or overbearing.The music was played at a reasonable volume and was appropriate, French pop of the sort you might hear on a Putamayo CD.The bread is excellent! We were given a little bit of a fish ( cod -mackerel) puree as what in some places is called an amuse bouche. This was followed  by a soup(leek-broccoli?).I had  a rare horse steak with a wine sauce as a main course accompanied by perfectly prepared vegetables.My wife had  duck breast cooked rare served with similar vegetables.For desert I had a chocolate  tart ; companion lemon tart.Unable to endure caffeine at night we had chamomile tea.I think this was  a Table D'Hote menu( forgive the bad French spelling it as bad my pronunciation).This is a BYOB  and I brought a bottle of Cahors. (Go to SAQ).By the way they have a Yelp discount on desert which was honored.Prices are reasonable.It is not far from  Rue St.Catherine  East- right off Ontario.(In other words downtown east).The neighborhood reminds me a little of the East Village in early gentrification."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Came here for dinner while visiting Montreal. Called half of Canada and this is the only restaurant that had horse on the menu that night. Its a small cute place with a trendy french vibe. Music was great, atmosphere was great, I could have sat and sipped wine there for hours. It is BYOB which is fantastic and very convenient. We had the foie gras creme brullee for appetizer which was a very interesting dish to try. The beet and coconut soup was also a treat. The horse steak was cooked to perfection and delicious. Cannot say anything negative about this place except that the wait time for food was a bit long but we did come in right as they opened up which is understandable. Waited for our main meals for about 1 hour. If you are looking for a cute place and feel like you escaped to Paris, this is it!"}
{"text":"The place is tiny and way too dated to be charging those prices. The bread was great but the $34 duck breast was chewy and not good at all. It lacked flavours. The cold served asparagus soup was also bland. Not sure what's the hype about this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cozy small byob resto which  serves up some awesome french cuisine dishes than Grenadine is a must try place. The resto is really small and would not recommend for big groups of more than 8. The decor has a rustic feel to it and has a group section that can hold table of 6. Friendly service and staff who serve their beautifully put together french cuisine dishes including foie gras and duck a l'orange. They have a tasting menu for 60$ per person which includes 6 wonderful dishes including dessert."}
{"text":"They're really good about vegetarians, had suggested modifications of on-menu items and a handful of acceptable menu items as well. I went hoping for horse, they were out of horse, I was sad but got over it. Steak was very well made, simple seasoning. Salads were beautiful and tasty. The space is intimate and relaxed, they have a nice wine list. The chef gave me a bunch of local recommendations, I had a great time."}
{"text":"We had the chefs surprise and it was unbelievable. Every dish was prepared and presented perfectly, and explained by our very sweet server. The food is local/fresh/organic and beautiful. We had a bit of everything; frogs legs, escargot, rabbit, horse, piglet, bison, salmon, oh my. The atmosphere is cozy and intimate and got pleasantly noisy towards closing. My first Montreal French cuisine experience and not my last."}
{"text":"Very accommodating!!Excellent dishes, presentation and service!! Thank you very much for a great evening!"}
{"text":"very intimate, to a fault.  tables were so close we knew that Jenn was the only one in the restaurant who had the char.  what seemed to be the most popular choice. and what I chose, was the bison filet.  everything was delicious and excellently prepared.  the byob option is always appreciated, pairing suggestions would have been nice but we did well withe the white to start the meal, less well with the red, my fault.  go here."}
{"text":"Deux fois en un an, j'y suis allée et à chaque fois, j'y ai pris le menu dégustation. J'ai trouvé chaque plat fait avec amour et créativité - surtout le faux-ossobuco - et ce menu vaut toujours son étiquette de 55$. Les desserts sont tous aussi goûteux, comme leur crème brûlée au chocolat (mon coup de cur)! Mais puisque c'est le genre de place qui change régulièrement de menu, je m'en tiendrai donc à dire que cet excellent apportez-votre-vin dans le Quartier latin offre un beau menu français-fusion, un excellent service accueillant, sourire et bon discussion inclus! 

Cependant, dans la liste des endroits ou ne pas aller avec une gagne de grandes gueules, celui-ci se classe dans le top. Vraiment mignon, mais intime... oh, très intime. Souvent de beaux petits couples en tête-à-tête aux conversations douces, c'est difficile de ne pas se sentir déplacé lorsqu'on arrive un petit groupe de jeunes dames, avec maintes bouteilles en main et de la conversation pour couvrir des mois de rattrapage... Mais on le fait pareil. Parce que c'est bon. Alors ne nous en voulez pas si vous vous ramassez à côté de nous!"}
{"text":"What a gem of a place! I ended up visiting Grenadine after a big mixup at the restaurant I initially planned to go to. The place was closed, it was after 9pm, and I was hungry! My trusty bf called Grenadine and asked if we could get a table and that we would be there asap. Needless to say, this place satisfied my hunger and I'm so happy that things turned out the way they did. The menu is small and concentrated on French and fusion foods. The specials are all freshly prepared local foods and the deserts (although not on the menu) are delicious. Everything, including the baguette, is made in house. I ordered the quail with couscous, tzakiki, and vegetables and paired that with our own bottle of red wine. The service was warm and friendly and they were happy to be serving dishes late into the night. Parking in the are is really tough so metro is highly recommended in the summer. Don't be skeptical when you see this place from the outside. It's tiny looking and packed full of delicious dining experiences."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. You MUST eat here if you are in Montreal. 

We got the six course tasting menu. Almost every time the two of us got a different dish, allowing us to share and taste even more. The chef is incredibly talented and uses a wide variety of more unusual ingredients with exceptional skill- horse tartar, rabbit with rolled pork, guinea hen, rhubarb sorbet with whiskey, etc. 

The meal was a perfect length and left us both full but not overstuffed. The restaurant is very charming and would make for a great date spot or just a nice meal with good friends. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ne vous laissez pas berner par l'aspect \"hole in the wall\" de la place; Grenadine est un petit bijou bien gardé.

Un BYOB, Grenadine est sans prétention - le restaurant est si petit de toute façon qu'une ambiance autre que collégiale serait difficile à imaginer. De la minuscule cuisine, les chefs sortent des plats quasi magiques. J'ai pu y déguster la bavette de cheval avec une crème de maïs... La soupe d'accompagnement était une crème de poireau, vraiment superbement exécutée. Le pain est chaud, le beurre est fait maison, quoi de plus à demander...!

Petit bémol: les lieux semblaient infestés de fourmis. Heureusement pas dans nos plats, mais elles grimpaient de bas en haut des murs à laquelle notre table. Et au moment de payer, nous avons observé une fourmis aussi au comptoir....

Les potions sont généreuses et, le bedon déjà rebondi, nous n'avons pas touché à la carte de desserts (si tentante qu'elle était! Qu'importe, une belle excuse pour revenir, j'essayerai la crème brûlée au thé chaï!"}
{"text":"Although often overlooked by the critics, this is one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal.  I had the horse steak and is was as tender and tasty as can be. The seared  duck breast was so perfectly cooked and not greasy, that it could easily have been confused with a fine steak. Dessert here was delightfully rich, but small enough to not overwhelm the palate. They even gave us a small appetizer while we were waiting for our table. What class! Best of all, the meal was reasonably priced and service was everything that I could have hoped for. 

The only thing I can add it  this restaurant is very small and the food is excellent, so it is always packed. Therefor, reservations are essential."}
{"text":"the Tiny BYOB
My boyfriend and I are always on the look out for BYOB's. It's so sad when you get to the wine list of a restaurant and discover a poor choice. It's not a problem when I bring my own, and it's cheaper too! So, we were very happy to discover this french place a walking distance from the Place des Arts. I when surprised when I entered face to face with the kitchen and the working chef. It's interesting to see him work but not that much. I almost wondered if I took the right door. Then, the waiter appeared and welcomed us. I don't remember his name, but I have to say he was excellent, very entertaining and thoughtful. He answered clearly every question we asked about the menu and gave us a fast service. There was only two tables occupied, but still, he gave a personality to the place.
The dining room is very small but it doesn't really matter. They didn't try to pack as much table as possible in there, so there's enough room and private space for every one. The menu seemed very nice. There was a lot of diversity with interesting taste and even a surprise tasting menu. I took the challenge from the chef thinking a surprise menu would be his very best dish or at least the one he likes to cook. I was left on my appetite. don't get me wrong the quantity was quite enough, but the taste was missing. Every dish was just so close to being good. Some elements on the plate was good but other were blend. In the amuse-bouche, there was a very good lime sauce which I also found in other dishes. In a discovery menu I was expecting different taste. The two entree were similar with the same tomatillos all over. At least, they were fresh. 
I the end, I had to order a dessert because it wasn't included in the tasting. I left with a good overall experience but unsatisfied tasebuds."}
{"text":"Overall food a very good in this BYO restaurant. It is very small, and seating is quite tight. The toilet at the end is like 1 metre from the nearest table.

Our group tried the group menu for $60 and the chef customised special dishes for us which we thoroughly enjoyed. What was interesting was that even though most of us opted for the $60 tasting menu, not all of us had the same dishes.  The variations and culinary quality of the food was amazing. The most memorable for us was the duck, done in two different styles for us; the most surprising was the horse tartare and venison (sorry if this is a spoiler for you); and I was also pleasantly surprised that the beet soup and fennel soup could be so tasty! So all in, the food was delightful.

I have to say I was rather underwhelmed by the service.  Normally for such cosy restaurants I have come to expect a more personal touch.  The service in this case was polite ... but nobody tried to explain the menu or make us feel welcomed or more excited about the food and place, even when taking orders.  Some enthusiasm and friendly chat from the service staff would have really topped off the evening.

A tip about parking.  This part of town is crazy. The public car park further down avenue de l'Hotel-de-Ville has only 20 lots at C$10. Rather than circling forever, I decided to just park at the CÉGEP underground car park along rue Ontario.  For C$12, I get to keep my sanity."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! After dining at so many restaurants in Montreal, I think I finally found this one, well priced and great taste! It's a BYOW place, take advantage of it!
We were here on Valentine's Day. We love the atmosphere, cozy and not pretentious. The pre-fixed menu is $66 with 6 courses. 
I love that the bread served here were warm, my favourite type and the butter was airy and fluffy. 
We got started with beets cappuccino with caviar. The chef was brilliant with this idea of combination, it was amazing. 
Then, horse tartar. It was exotic and not a dish you can get anywhere else. Again, great play on combination of flavour. It was great. 
I love the squid ink pasta the most! The texture was a little chewy, exactly the way I liked. The mussels were so fresh. 
Bison steak main course was tender, juicy and the sauces (red wine and butternut squash) were awesome. 
Dessert was not bad, chocolate mousse. 

The service here is not the best, they only have 2 server in the entire restaurant but they still took the time to answer questions and make sure we are enjoying our meal. 

Their food was absolutely stunning, they make really unique and creative dishes. The chef is a genius that creates amazing taste palettes! This is a hidden gem in Montreal and deserve more fame!"}
{"text":"Je recommande ce restaurant!
Incroyable. Ils amenent un petit tartare avec les pains au début. Les employés sont très gentils, ils ont l'air d'aimer nous servir. 

J'y retournerai c'est certain.


I recommend that place.
Its delicious, staff is very nice they seem to like their job. They even give a tartare with the bread when you arrive. 

I'm going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner on New Year's Eve at Grenadine. It's a tiny place and so when our group of 9 arrived, there were people still from the first seating inside the restaurant so half our group had to wait outside. Not so good in the freezing cold, so we Californians stayed inside and had the Montrealers who were more used to the weather stand outside. LOL!  

The food was very good, they had a 7 course prix fixe menu for $70.  There were 3 courses where we had a choice between two different items, and so between my husband and I, we were able to share everything. The menu began with happy oysters (which were ok), followed by an amazing mushroom cappucino with truffled milk. Choice of bison or foie gras, both excellent, mushroom and fennel salad (my favorite item of the dinner) or asian style arctic char dumpling with salmon roe, followed by quail or scalllops and ending with a dark chocolate ganache with coconut brittle which was just ok, but the again I am not a dessert person. The one thing that made the the experience less enjoyable was the cold air coming in through the window which meant I had to keep my jacket on and so no one could see my beautiful festive new years outfit that I had borrowed from my fashionable Montreal based sister. 

BYOB is always a great thing in many Montreal restaurants, so the evening was very festive starting and ending with Veuve Cliquot, as we rang in the New Year."}
{"text":"Decent French BYOW tucked away between the gay village and the quartier des spectacles. 

Cozy ambiance but tables are on the very small side. Your neighbour's table will literally be 10cm away from yours. Makes for some good snooping into other conversations if you're into that ;) 

Varied menu with a lot of gamey meats to choose from (Guinea fowl, horse, blood sausage, etc). 

All mains served with a soup or salad of the day as well as an amuse bouche which was a nice touch. 

For appetizers we had the foie gras crème brûlée, a bit on the sweeter side and more dessert like than appetizer like but very tasty nonetheless, as well as the blood sausage which was very well executed. 

For mains we opted for lamb and the Guinea fowl. The lamb was very tasty, served in a 'squished' manner as the braised meat was compacted into a square bursting with spices. The Guinea fowl however was a bit disappointing as it was on the inside was dry and the skin not crispy enough. 

Good for a quiet date night with a nice bottle of wine, but maybe not the best setting for a first date kinda place if you're looking for more intimacy."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! ANd it's BYOW
The service is great, very attentive even though the place was jam packed.
Lots of vegetables on the plates and the portions are great!
I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I'm truly impressed by this little quartier latin gem. I had the next-to-impossible task of booking a restaurant for a bachelorette party; it had to be affordable, fancy, with a fixed menu, group-friendly and BYOB. Thank god for Grenadine.

After sweet-talking the maitre-D they allowed me to book the group months in advance and were incredibly accommodating in the booking process- I changed the group number several times and threw in a peanut and shellfish allergy and they were still happy to help. The day of I was even texting with the staff, finalizing all the details.

At the actual event we were initially very surprised at the snugness of the restaurant (expecting maybe a separate group room) but it still worked out fabulously. The service was consistently patient with us (despite several of our party goers being a bit much) and was really efficient for a group with three courses- all said and done we were out of there after two hours.

Above all, the food was incredible (for $42 a head!)- I had some very picky ladies with us and not a single person was disenchanted with the meal. I enjoyed the foie gras crème brulée and horse steak and not only was I absolutely blown away by the quality, but the quantity was impressive. I can't speak highly enough of this place."}
{"text":"This Small intimate space hosts a delightful and varied menu.  The six of us enjoyed every aspect of our meal.  The table d'hôte features soup or salad, a main course and dessert.  You can add an appetizer for $9.  My son in law started with venison tartare and declared it to be amazing.  I had bison short ribs for my main and I actually started salivating from the smell alone when the waitress placed the plate on the table.  The taste did not disappoint. Lest this appear to be only a game meat restaurant, let me mention that our friend, a vegetarian, asked the waitress what they could do for him and they brought a tower of pureed root vegetables on a bed of chickpeas, along with a variety of the vegetable sides that were featured in the meat dishes.  Madeleines for dessert and a very respectable espresso finished an excellent meal.  Bring your own wine.  Under $40 per person."}
