{"text":"Great food and a great mission to bring a little comfort and joy to those fighting cancer!  My deliveries on Friday mornings are a bright spot in my week knowing how much it means to the recipients!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Non profit with a good cause and salsa that is actually spicy."}
{"text":"Awful place! I regret going their today, female manager at this place is racist! I have  never been discriminated in my entire life until I came to this place. I should have known something was wrong when their was an open table as we walked in but the manager said it would take about 5 minutes sit us. Decided to take my chances and we waited to be seated. We ordered our meals and waited for what seemed like an eternity  ( 35 minutes to be exact ) but our food was nowhere in sight. People that came in 10 & 20 minutes after us got their food right away. Of course I don't have to mention that all of these customers were white which they didn't ask for any special treatment but the female manager felt they were more important than my family.  I went to my waiter and explained the displeasure plus I  also went into detail as to what we had experienced. The manager was aware of the situation and she still decided to ignore us and didn't care how we were treated. I paid for our drinks and cancelled the food order.  Horrible experience I would not wish this on someone else's family. ........stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Love the concept!! Great menu, atmosphere & service. I had the lemon poppyseed pancakes and bacon - they were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast & lunch spot on the way to work.   The staff are so friendly I consider them family.  Check out their mission statement if you really need a reason to stop by and support this great business."}
{"text":"I love this place, for several reasons. One, all proceeds go to the charity where they provide meals to cancer patients. Two, the food is outstanding for being a diner. Good portions and so reasonably priced. The staff is friendly and more than enthusiastic to share information about the charity and any other questions we've had. I love the atmosphere in this diner as well! It's so nicely decorated. They also sell really great tees. I'm probably going to buy one of their baseball tees soon!"}
{"text":"Went here about quarter to 11 today.  Seated within about 10 minutes.  Waited another 10 to order drinks.  No waters.  Husband ordered the cup of joe with a side of dough.  I got a cup of joe.  10 minutes later, 2 two tops seated after us had waters and drinks.  We had nothing.  Apparently making 3 donuts to come with a cup of coffee delays drinks substantially.  When we were able to flag down a waitress - 3 girls working, with what seemed no organized system, we were brought 2 cups of coffee, and took the opportunity to order, because no one had been by, we did not have setups and had one menu between the two of us, that I had picked up near the door while we were waiting to be seated.    Our coffee was dropped off, and the waitress turned around and left.  No cream.  Another 5-10 minutes to get it.  \"I'm just trying to get caught up.\"  I can see that you are stressed.     Donuts arrived - the side of dough.  They tasted great.  Not sure if the centers were supposed to be uncooked, but they were.  Still, tasted fantastic.  Coffee was good too.  1 refill in the hour that we were there, before we chose to leave, without our food.   In addition, a man who sat down 15 minutes after us, had his food 10 minutes before we chose to leave, at 1150.    Multiple people waiting with tables not cleared and a line out the door.  Witnessed several other patrons have to get up to flag down a server to help them.   I cannot comment on the food.  What I saw go out looked great.  I love the idea of 100% of the proceeds going to charity.  It is a noble cause and a wonderful idea.  Unfortunately, I regret that due to the problems with the front of the house, we will not be back.   Coffee was good.    When we left the 2 two tops next to us were still waiting for their food with empty drinks.    Bummer."}
{"text":"The food is as great as the concept and charity! I feel lucky that Joy Bus is in our 'hood. Had the pancakes, eggs and bacon and was overjoyed to have real maple syrup included with the perfectly cooked plate of locally purveyed food. An old Subway sandwich shop transformed into a gem! I will definitely be back.   Now, after repeat visits, take out and eating more of the menu, I'm convinced that supporting this restaurant is not only good for our 'hood, helping the community but great for my physical and mental well being!!  What other restaurant can boast that??!!!  The filling in the poppyseed pancakes is proportioned just right- so good, chicken and waffles - delicious crunchy sweet and salty, salads - makes me feel justified, Ruben and a giant lunch burro were so filling. Go!  Today I discovered that it's a one mile walk to Joy Bus. I see more cardio in the future! Also, more good Karma!!"}
{"text":"It warms my heart that there is a place like this.  Had a delicious, fresh breakfast for next to nothing so made sure to add a generous donation to the cause.  Kept it simple with two eggs, toast, potatoes and bacon.  $5 bucks!  Service was great!  If you end up there, please add a donation to provide meals for home bound cancer patients."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Not only is this diner supporting an amazing cause, the food is SO GOOD! We came in on a Tuesday mid-morning and wasn't busy at all. I had the avocado woods toast. It was so delicious, I could eat it every day. The ingredients are donated by local farmers and suppliers so all the food is super fresh and very inexpensive. The fact that this place is donating warm meals for those battling cancer should be reason enough to check this diner out. 10/10 would recommend. If I could give this place more stars I definitely would. Can't say enough good things about it."}
{"text":"After recently losing a friend to a 3 and a half year battle with cancer last week, we thought it would be a great way to honor him by checking out The Joy Bus. What a great place! I had the feel goods from the moment I walked in there. You can tell the staff is super passionate about what they do. They're very friendly and caring people. And the food was tasty too! My boyfriend and I both did build your own omelettes and didn't hold back on the extras. I got a side of bacon and he got a side of fries and it was less than 20 bucks. What a steal! I felt like I wanted to give them more money just because. My favorite part of the meal was the rosemary potatoes. Yummy yummy!   RIP Kyle Hodge"}
{"text":"Good, fresh food served efficiently by volunteers. You definitely want to try this adorable place out and learn about the wonderful concept behind it:)"}
{"text":"https://www.thejoybusdiner.com/  OMG!!! This gem of a Diner is DDD worthy!  Guy Fieri and his little red Camaro need to pull into this Scottsdale spot ASAP!  Let's put the food aside for a moment and think about what the reason behind The Joy Bus Diner is....5 star worthy all on it's own.  If you haven't done so already take a look at their website to find out what your business  will do for their business, scratch that, their MISSION. On to the food, which is let's face it, the reason you're on Yelp.  I consider myself a Diner enthusiast.  I love Diners and the nostalgia behind them.  When at a Diner I look for two menu items 1) Patty Melt 2) Rueben.  If neither is on the menu then don't call yourself a Diner.  Joy Bus has both and today I sampled the Rueben.  Homemade, house smoked corned beef was the epicenter of this sandwich and it was melt in your mouth phenomenal! The sauerkraut was perfectly prepared, dressing was just the right amount, ample ample serving of melty cheese and the rye bread was toasted to perfection.  If the Rueben was this fantastic you can bet I will be back to try the Patty Melt. My wife ordered the chicken and Biscuit but even though she offered me a sample I couldn't break away from my sandwich to take her up on it.  I will say that she rarely clears her plate and today it looked like it had just been taken out of the dishwasher when our server came with the check!!!  Don't miss out on the opportunity to pay The Joy Bus Diner a visit.  This place is special and the food is, as Guy would say...MONEY!"}
{"text":"This place got high ratings and I'm not sure why. Maybe we just had a bad experience. We sat for almost 10 minutes before our waitress even took our drink order so it just started bad. I had the chilaquiles which came out cold. Like straight from the fridge. Sent it back. Came back. Warm chips on top cold on the bottom. Most Mexican restaurants I have chilaquiles at generally serve them with beans and some sort of meat in the chili sauce with the chips. I believe this needs more than just chips and one egg. My wife had the traditional eggs benedict. The ham was really good. Highlight of the meal. The eggs were poached so long the yolk was actually cooked and it was served on bread which was weird. Sorry but we won't be back."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place.  It's tucked away in a small business center.  The atmosphere is welcoming and the food is delicious. The staff is  always friendly. Love that the proceeds go to a great cause. Definitely one of our favorite neighborhood eats."}
{"text":"Server staff was great!  We came in for a late lunch and easily got a table.  Unfortunately, the Kitchen staff wasn't really up for working.  You could see the tension and attitude they were giving the server staff.  They even messed up our order.  The servers all apologized profusely and we left happy.  We will be back...hopefully the kitchen staff will be in a better mood."}
{"text":"I know everyone is writing about the cause, but let me tell you about the biscuits and gravy. Oh em gee!  Very very unique and delicious and I'm from Nebraska where BnG is a food group. Savory, the biscuit was slightly heavy but still flaked away and toasted. Eggs and bacon were yummy and cooked perfectly. I wanted to try some other things on the menu and will but had to try the BnG first. I'll be back. Wish list: a bike rack out front."}
{"text":"Great find We will definitely  be back...very fresh!!!we enjoyed avocado toast  and lox plate added over easy eggs ...yummy"}
{"text":"I got The avocado toast and yogurt parfait and it came nicely presented. My husband got the breakfast burrito that was pretty big and it was only five bucks. The best part about this place is that it's all non-profit. All of the cash they make goes to a charity. The cost is  reasonable too. Overall, I would go back and try something else. Do you chicken and waffles look real damn good. Give it a try."}
{"text":"If you gave this place a bad review, then nothing can make you happy, you are likely single, or if you are not single... your partner secretly hates being around you because you complain too much. Went there for the first time this Saturday.  Went for the second time on Sunday.  The breakfast was awesome.  Eggs, potatoes, bacon, waffle, French toast, wheat toast... it's amazing and fresh.  Orange juice was great too! The staff was really friendly and I was served very quickly.  I am so glad this place is a mile from me.  I am a regular every weekend from here on out."}
{"text":"This Review is long over due. I have now been to this local restaurant various time in the last two months ordering everything from omelets to their chilaquiles and everything I've tasted has been Great. Having a non profit restaurant with killer food for a good cause is a Win, Win, Win! If your in the area don't think twice and stop by to check out the friendly faces and great food!"}
{"text":"I am in love w this place!  Just went for the first time because we were craving a good breakfast.  We walked in, were instantly greeted w a friendly smile, and were sat immediately.  The atmosphere is very true diner-ish, w cute chairs, dishes, decor, etc.    Our waitress was great, very friendly and attentive.  All the staff were joking w each other and w the other diners, it was a fun place w great 80s jams playing in the background.    I had the Make Your Own omelette w all the veggies (bell pepper, onion, tomato, jalapeño, arugula, and spinach) and added chorizo.  It was sooooo good!!  Cheesy, the chorizo was great, the omelette was fluffy...sooo good!!  We also ordered the two eggs breakfast that came w two eggs, toast, potatoes, and bacon.  The peach (apricot?) jam that came w the toast was delicious!!!  And best of all?!  It's very reasonably priced.    Will most definitely add this to my favorites list for breakfast!"}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed our lunch! Everything we ordered tasted delicious, and my husband thought they had the best chicken & waffles!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast/lunch and a very noble cause behind the restaurant. I go back every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Joybus Diner was truly a joyful experience. Food was incredibly fresh and delicious. Portions healthy (literally), perfectly generous and PRICING unbeatable! We had Avocado Wood Toast and the Honkin Huge Burrito...and we said YUUUUUUUMMMMMYYY!  Our server was humble, gracious with a great attitude. Their story is a beautiful and worthy cause...you'll likely over tip with gratitude. We'll be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"OK, once in a while you come across a place that cares as much about their food as they do about the community. This is one of those places. These guys are changing the world. We had no idea that they are doing so much for cancer patients as a non-for profit diner until after our meal. And our meal was exceptional. The food is amazing. The people are incredible. And what they're doing for people who are suffering cancer is inspiring. This is a must stop."}
{"text":"Small diner with amazing food. Will definitely come here again! Great food and friendly staff"}
{"text":"This place is worth any drive from anywhere in the Valley! I've been in the restaurant biz for over 50 years. When you walk into this place, you can tell the whole staff \"gets it!\" Food and service are OUTSTANDING!Make sure to try the chicken and waffles! Jennifer is running a non-profit that makes healthy meals for cancer patients. A great cause,food, & service all at the same place?! Fantastic...Can't wait to drive by hundreds of breakfast places to bring my family and friends here as soon as possible"}
{"text":"Found this place by reviews on yelp and tried it out last week. Excellent food with an emphasis on taste, quality and presentation. Kind of an obscure little place just East of the 51 on the South side of Shea Blvd... Always try to support local businesses... throw in a non-profit for a good cause makes where I spend my money a no brainer. The quality of the food and service will bring me back of its own accord. That good feeling about where the money goes is my dessert."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far. Both times were a positive experience. Its nice to have a diner other than Denny's in the Phoenix area. Great to support a locally family owned -breakfast  / lunch spot."}
{"text":"A great value with delicious food, plus it benefits the community!  I came at around 11:30 AM and got in just before the lunch rush. I started off with a lemonade which was really good and really refreshing on a hot day. I ordered a Reuben which was beautifully toasted on some delicious rye bread. The pastrami has some bits of fattiness which was an interesting but tasty surprise. The sandwich was nicely balanced by the sauerkraut and Russian dressing. The fries have some nice Cajun type seasoning and reminds me of the Cajun fries from Five Guys."}
{"text":"The place rates 5 Stars right off the back!!! \"Why\", you may ask? It is non-profit restaurant where the staff and volunteers deliver food to people who have been diagnosed with cancer and to their families. Every last CENT is used for this great Cause!  Now for the food.  As you can tell from the pics, it is Wonderful! Chef aspired and prepared food in its simplest form.  The taste - well if I had \"smell - i - vision\" you would drive or fly to taste and smell the food.  Food - 4 1/2 stars Only reasons -   Patty melt could have been a little more with the seasoning (salt and pepper) - personal choice of course.   Home Fries - 5 stars - is must be the oil they use and the type of potato.   My Reuben was delicious. Perfectly smoked but was light on the Thousand Island. Again, personal choice. - 4 1/2 stars  Staff - 5 stars Ambiance - 5 stars Friendly and efficient - 5 stars Low key and kick back environment- 5 stars"}
{"text":"Loved this little gem of a restaurant. Especially the fact that everything is made to order and includes ingredients from local farms. There animal products are free Range and hormone antibiotics free. Most importantly the food is very good."}
{"text":"I went here because it was in walking distance  from my RV.  Intrigued by the business model (supports cancer patients) I went to check it out.  I only had time for coffee but I checked the menu and the servers (volunteers but very professional) and drooled over some of the pastries.  They were very busy, people waiting to be seated on a Sunday morning.  I loved the casualness of the place and the comfort-type food.  I will return tomorrow with a friend and both of us will be hungry.  More later."}
{"text":"I am enjoying my day off and me and my lovely wife dropped off our daughter at her new school.  We looked for a new place to have breakfast and found a hidden gem. The Joy Bus has amazing food. I had the Chile Filet Benedict. The Chile sause was just spicy enough, poached eggs were perfect and the Filet tips were tender and tastey. The rosemary potatoes were literally the best I have ever had!  Coffee is locally roasted with a smokey flavor. My wife had the Avocado Toast and she loved hers as well.  The only thing better than the food is that this restaurant provides healthy meals to homebound cancer patients so make sure to donate $10 to provide a healthy meal to these folks in need!"}
{"text":"So happy to find this hidden gem!!! Great food and a 100% of proceeds go to delivering meals to those in need dealing with cancer. In the strip mall just east of the 51 on south side of Shea. No signage except window. Well worth the hunt!!!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood.  Great for breakfast and for a great cause too!  Don't find many restaurant like this anywhere!    Despite that, DO NOT GET THEIR PATTY MELT!  It comes on some delicious rye bread but the patty was a round 1/4 lb burger patty lump and covered half of the bread.  The patty should be flat, grilled with onions and cover most of the bread.  Stick with breakfast, that's the safer choice.  The Reuben was ok too.  Be sure to ask for no salt on the fries, way over salted.  Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Joy Bus Diner is a neighborhood gem. The service is amazing and the food selection is vast.  It's also nice to know it is a nonprofit organization that helps homebound cancer patients.   The chilaquiles are fantastic, best of served with chicken.  I highly recommend it for a delicious meal in a casual friendly place."}
{"text":"To my recollection, I've never dined at a non-profit restaurant before in my life.  In a restaurant scene as gruelingly competitive as the Phoenix area, the idea of a restaurant operating for the purpose of charity is hard to wrap my mind around.  But owner Jennifer Caraway had a vision, and here it is.  The Joy Bus organization began in 2011 as a mission to deliver healthy gourmet meals to homebound cancer patients as well as deliver compassionate interactions to meal recipients.  Since then, their charitable operation has expanded to include this diner on the southwest corner of 35th Street and Shea.  Hungry for a good breakfast on a Saturday morning and always up for helping a good cause, I made the pilgrimage.  Just as with the meals The Joy Bus charity serves their cancer patients, the Joy Bus Diner emphasizes healthy gourmet items on the bulk of their menu.  The restaurant sources the bulk of their items locally and in fact many of the food items served here are donated from local farms and distributors.  You might understandably question what type of quality and creativity to expect with donated ingredients, but the Yelp ratings gave me optimism that I would have a good breakfast here.  The diner itself is hidden in a relatively non descript strip center with seating for about 40 altogether.  I arrived at opening and grabbed a seat at the front counter.  To start my meal, I embraced my inner millennial and went with the item that is apparently Joy Bus' most popular menu offering.  The Avocado Woods Toast.  Avocado, arugula, tomato, and a poached egg stacked high on toasted bread.  The portion is appetizer sized, but nevertheless a tasty treat for those who love avocado (and I do).  I especially enjoyed the mix of the egg yolk with the veggies and toast.  For my second act, I went with a breakfast staple I usually steer clear of.  Oatmeal.  In the case of Joy Bus, its their Bircher Muesli.  What's this you ask?  A traditional Swiss oatmeal made with raw oats, slices of seasonal fruits (in today's case it was coconut, apples, blueberries, and grapes), milk, whipped cream, and a dash of cinnamon.  If oatmeal tasted like this, I would eat oatmeal everyday.  An absolutely fantastic dish with lots of fresh fruit and the perfect balance of oats and cream.  Still hungry, I closed out my meal with their CSA Scramble with Egg Whites.  The CSA is for Crooked Sky Farms (one of Joy Bus' biggest suppliers).  Egg whites with mixed veggies (I picked up spinach, onions and potatoes), with a side of fruits, sliced tomatoes, whole grain toast and peach jam.  A well balanced, healthy, delicious plate mixing in sweet, salty, tart, acidic, grainy and whatever other adjectives you wanna throw in there.  Point is, the food here is excellent.  Total cost for the food, tax, and tip came to $25.  A healthy, delicious, inexpensive meal at a low cost and for a great cause.  Its a feel good story all around at Joy Bus.  You can be sure I'll be back to try out their lunch menu, eager to sample more delicious offerings.  And also eager to support Jennifer Caraway's worthy mission to make life in the valley a little bit better for those in need of a good meal and a smile.  Here's hoping Jennifer's non-profit business model is not just a one off, but a movement that we'll see replicated elsewhere in the valley's vibrant local food community."}
{"text":"Great food for a great cause!!  Joy Bus delivers meals to those suffering from cancer.  This was my first visit to the Joy Bus diner.   Sadly, I forgot to take a picture of my delicious meal!  For breakfast I had the Avocado toast.  The thick Toast, avocado and egg was very tasty!   The staff is very friendly and the service was quick. The mango iced tea was a refreshing compliment to my meal."}
{"text":"The food and service is amazing. The orange juice is freeze squeezed, the coffee is bottomless, and everything is handmade. I even got the chicken in a biscuit for a breakfast, which is from the lunch menu. We will be back to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Cool little find in the strip mall by Bootlegger's.  Charitable business model - cool.  Really good Reuben sandwich - very cool!  Gotta go back and try more items...or maybe just get the Reuben again, because it was really good...decisions, decisions, decisions..."}
{"text":"We decided to give this new little breakfast and lunch spot a try today. I had a Ruben and the corned beef was the best I've ever had - smoked by Bootleggers! The fries are made with real potatoes and taste so fresh. Good service, great cause - stop on by!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day so I am always happy to find a great new place. Not only is the food good but the story behind it is wonderful.  We started off with orange juice and coffee. The juice came in a cute mason jar with a handle but it had ice in it which was weird to my son and I. We both ordered chicken and waffles and my husband had the princess poppyseed pancakes. The chicken was flavorful and tender but the coating tended to fall off as you cut into it. Still a dish worth trying. My husbands pancakes had a bright lemon curd filling and were delicious. They were huge and came with two strips of tasty bacon on the side.   Breakfast for three came to about $40.00. The service was decent and the food was good so we will definitely go back.  They are open for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Don't know what to make of this place.  Wife and I went for the first time and the servers were all happy and friendly and talked to us.  The food was very good. The second time we returned, the wait staff were not happy and friendly.  The food wasn't as good either.  Lightning didn't strike in the same place.  Unfortunately we raved about it to friends so we went there after church and everyone's food was kind of a bust. May or may not go back.  It's hard to go back to a place after a less than happy experience."}
{"text":"Small place in a small strip mall just off SR-51 north of Phoenix.  Good breakfast options, and the breakfast potatoes are very good. The unique part of this place is that they also take meals to those in need using their \"Joy Bus\", and that's setup as a non-profit. You can add a small donation on your bill, as well as the normal tip.  Nothing fancy food-wise, just a good breakfast served by nice people who also like to do good things."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is good ... Great!   Prices are excellent, and it all goes to charity for cancer research... my fav foods are: chicken and waffles, lemon poppyseed pancakes, breakfast and lunch burritos... etc"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! The waitress was fast and friendly, the food was delicious, I had the biscuits and gravy and could have licked the plate clean! My son and husband had the pancakes, and the sausages were awesome with a little spicy kick! Great place will definitely go back! Also, they help out a great cause."}
{"text":"Innovative food friendly service. It's a small place and when I was there a group of people came in so I waited in infinity it seemed cuz I was hungry. The food was delicious when it arrived. I am willing to give it another try in the future and hope I won't run into too many customers in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The chai tea was delicious and organic. My salad was fresh and hearty. To top things off, the cherry pie mason jar was fresh out of the oven. Mmmm."}
{"text":"If I could pick this place up and transplant it to Indy, preferably right next door to my home, I would. Everything about our visit to The Joy Bus Diner was perfect. The staff were super kind and efficient, the prices were reasonable, and the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated.  And the food. It was so, so good. I had a really basic breakfast - the typical eggs and pancakes, etc. Everything was done so well, though, and it was really obvious that the food was made to order, and hasn't just been sitting in food warmers. My husband's breakfast was super delicious, too. He had the Chile Benedict and it was great - tons of flavor and just the right amount of heat.  The worst part of our meal was realizing that we live 1500 miles away and probably won't be back any time soon. If I could, I'd make this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"I met a coworker here for breakfast last week and really enjoyed it.  The staff was very welcoming and attentive, the atmosphere is laid back and casual and the food was quite tasty.  I enjoyed some hot peppermint tea and an egg white omelette with onions, spinach and tomatoes - a good, healthy way to kick start the day!"}
{"text":"Eat here for the pure altruism of it if you like but you needn't think you're doing a favor with no reward. The food is awesome, place is cute as a dot and the volunteers and staff earnestly cater to your every need. This is the intersection of good works and good food!"}
{"text":"Great food, service was good. I came once for lunch and had the great Ruben sandwich and loved it. This time had pancakes and eggs. Very good choice, two perfect eggs and potatoes, sausage and pancakes. Highly recommend it! I'll be back in to try the burger."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in a strip mall.   Super friendly and casual staff.  First time here, so we ordered quite a spread.  Chicken and Waffles, Pancakes, and biscuits & gravy (seeing the gorgeous looking pan of biscuits sitting at the pass, we had to try it).    Well pardon my French, but M-F-er!  This s- is f-ng ridiculous!  The biscuits taste just like they look... solid crust on the outside, fluffy, flakey inside.   The gravy has perhaps a bite too much sausage but is delicious overall.  Everything else was fabulous, coma-inducing breakfast food... even the chicken which was battered chicken breasts (vs traditional fried chicken) with waffles.  The atmosphere and general feel was indicative of the restaurant's non-profit story - comfortable, welcoming.   Ironically, they were located next to a right-wing political \"consulting\" service (you know, those people who harass you to sign petitions outside the library, the causes for which they know nothing)."}
{"text":"YES 5 STARS ! If you went here and ate and then had the audacity to write a bad review then cancer has never hit close to your heart! I highly doubt you left hungry ? Maybe not full but not hungry besides stop and think about a cancer patient that is lucky enough to benefit from this amazing idea and concept! 100% profit goes to feeding Cancer Patients! So truly know what it is before you go and understand it and you will love the fact your helping feed a Patient going thru the worst time of their life with no guarantees they will make it! And your upset cause you had to wait or portions were not obese sized American meals shame on you! go because you believe in the cause not because your starving and expect 5 star service!  food was great atmosphere awesome and server was a beautiful spirit ! No Go Support An Amazing Cause People ! #ScrewCancer"}
{"text":"The best chicken and waffles. Great customer service. Saw Chef Jennifer Caraway and fangirled a little bit."}
{"text":"When someone makes the world better it's as good as it gets..........  The Joy Bus Diner is a 100% non-profit restaurant.  Proceeds go to the Joy Bus charity that delivers free meals to those stricken with cancer and other illness.  The atmosphere is cheerful with colorful  brightly painted metal chairs and children's paintings on paper bags that are the artwork that adorns the wall.  This restaurant serves breakfast and lunch and the prices are very reasonable.  I had the power salad with added salmon. ($10.00)  My salad came with garbanzo beans that seemed like fresh cooked, lots of sweet small tomatoes, feta cheese, ripe creamy avocado and my added salmon was thin rolls of smoked salmon.  My husband had the double patty melt. It was more generous in size than my husband was expecting. They add onions to the beef patties to keep them moister because they serve the patties medium/well.   You might have a bit of difficulty finding this restaurant because at the time of this review they don't have a sign over the restaurant. The Joy Bus Diner is in the same strip mall as Bootleggers.  My review rating is based on the work that is done here.  When someone makes the world better it's as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"There is not enough good things to say about this place. We were in town on vacation and wanted a good place for breakfast, well we found it. We ate here almost every morning we were in town! Had something different each time and every dish was delicious! The service was amazing and everyone was so friendly. On top of that it's just a great place supporting a great cause and we don't have a diner or eatery like this where we live so it was nice to have this as a cherry on top for our trip. Prices were reasonable and even the servings of food were not too much or too little not to mention it was completely fresh and healthy. We can't wait to go back just to eat here again."}
{"text":"Found Joy bus on Yelp. Drove all the way from the Northwest valley to give it a try. We got there minutes after they opened. I think it was the freshest breakfast I've eaten in a restaurant. The hollandaise sauce was being made as we ordered. Very flavorful! And friendly service with a warm smile! I would definitely recommend as a great breakfast spot!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp, thought we stopped by and try their food. Didn't have any expectations, they were a diner after all. Boy was I pleasantly surprise to taste their food. What I thought was a greasy spoon, turned out to be a really good and fresh place to eat. Almost everything was under  $10, fresh and good decent portions. Being a NYker, I'm very critical of corn beef, their Ruben sandwich was delicious, it is served with homemade French fries that are dusted with garlic powder. Their patty melt was super juicy also served with fries. Our little one wanted a single pancake which was fluffy, spongy and not grainy or doughy. Great little diner with an incredible mission. Will be coming back soon to taste other items on their menu. BTW, homemade lemonade and OJ."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! My mother and I stopped in on a Tuesday morning and were seated and served very promptly. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very laid back and cozy. It was clean and pleasant. I ordered an orange juice which comes in a cute mason jar. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and tasted absolutely amazing. I'd come back just for that! They were out of pancake mix, and my mother wanted to order the pancake meal and I wanted the 2 eggs with pancakes. Luckily for us, they offered to substitute waffles for the pancakes in our meals. The waffles were so delicious and the syrup had great flavor, compared to most that just taste like liquid sugar. The bacon was very high quality and the potatoes had rosemary for seasoning. Overall, the food was tasty and it's for a great cause. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my husband. The place itself is really cute and the cause is wonderful. Walked in and were greeted by a friendly man and seated immediately. I ordered a lemonade and the lox plate, my husband ordered the Rueben. Lemonade was fresh and delicious. My lox plate was also very good. Husband's Rueben did not have any dressing on it. When he asked if they had thousand island or Russian/French dressing they offered him ranch or mayo. The dressing is a key component of a Rueben so this was disappointing. Our waitress was very mediocre, forgot my lemonade at first and generally apathetic. I may give this place another try because there were many positives but hard to leave more than 3 stars after the first visit."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Small brunch/lunch diner in a strip mall. Has about 10 tables inside, a couple seats at the bar and two on the outside patio. The artsy decor and multi-colored chairs gives the place a fun and funky vibe. Patrons are an eclectic bunch from all ages and backgrounds.  Food:  A truly eclectic lunch and breakfast menu. My family went with the chicken and waffles and the Honken-huge burrito which they said was superb. I went with the crispy chicken and biscuit sandwich which was good but really a clumsy ordeal because the chicken came as large chicken strips and the biscuit was the standard sized biscuit bun so the whole thing fell apart several times. The combination of deep fried chicken on a biscuit without much sauce made it dry as well but still tasty.  Service/Price: Everyone had a smile on their face and made you feel welcome. Price was pretty good and knowing your dollars support a good cause makes it all the better.  Overall: A great little place to grab breakfast or lunch and support a worthwhile cause."}
{"text":"Service was solid and the food was mostly good. Biscuits and gravy were lacking in flavor and the biscuits seemed old. Rest of the food was really well made and flavorful. The portion sizes are quite small compared to similar restaurants for breakfast. The cause for the restaurant profits are great so this place if worth a visit."}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast place near our house we could ride our bikes to. Came across this place on google right around the corner from our house. Wow! Great food, amazing cause, fantastic service! Try the Lemon poppy seed pancakes! Yum!"}
{"text":"We had the breakfast burrito with chorizo, French toast, and biscuits and gravy. All were really good. My 2 year old ate about twice as much as he normally does. If you have a huge appetite, I suggest adding a side of eggs to the biscuits and gravy. Also, the gravy isn't  your traditional pure white, but it's so good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Just found my new favorite breakfast spot!  Thanks for making our day."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood needed another awesome breakfast and lunch place and we look forward to eating here again!"}
{"text":"This place is a following! It's in an unassuming parking lot / micro mall type place. Don't let that discourage you. Everyone inside the restaurant is full of heart and pride working for a great cause. The food is fantastic. Go try it! You will enjoy it."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here based on the Yelp reviews and location. We were not disappointed!! The food was amazing,the service was great and the prices are unbelievable. The breakfast burritos are huge! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Not only does this restaurants existence wrap around serving others but the staff work exceptionally hard at servicing the patrons. I came in late, a couple minutes before closing. They insisted on serving me, I asked for it to go and then he told me to feel free and enjoy my meal. This restaurant has exceptional customer service and their willingness to serve the community is amazing. I had the JOY of experiencing were the most delicious Rubens I've had in quite a long time. Sauerkraut was spot on, the pastrami had a beautiful taste, The right amount of thousand Island dressing &  A marbled rye perfectly toasted. I cannot wait to come back! I wish they had a joy bus on the east side of town I would be there every day"}
{"text":"What a gem! We stumbled upon this place while looking for a good breakfast, and am extremely impressed with both the quality of the food, and the integrity of the purpose. You can feel good about eating here, as the funds go back to supporting cancer patients food deliveries, plus it's adorable, service was great and the food was inventive and delicious. It's probably best of Phoenix for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that there's a new breakfast and lunch spot in my neighborhood. I've been here 3 times and enjoyed it every time. The Reuben sandwich is really tasty --corned beef, sauerkraut and thousand island dressing on pumpernickel bread. Yum. The other 2 times were for breakfast. I love the avocado toast and the lemon poppy pancakes."}
{"text":"What a nice breakfast we had this morning at the Joy Bus diner. I was expecting awful service since most of the negative reviews brought it up, but we got the complete opposite. We came in pretty early so it wasn't very packed yet but the employees had a big smile on their face and they were very friendly.   The restaurant is a little small and there is no sign on the building, but it is to the right of Bootleggers. Hubby ordered the breakfast burrito and I ordered the avocado woods toast. I enjoyed every bite of my toast! It was delicious!! Hubby liked his burrito too. Prices are really inexpensive too, since I'm assuming because they are a not for profit restaurant. Our bill was less than $10!! You do have the option to put an additional donation and since we would probably pay double our bill somewhere else, we decided to match what we would pay somewhere else and give $10 as an additional donation plus tip since our server was all smiles.  Overall, I like the cause, the service and the food so I'll be back again shortly."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places to go to. You eat as well as you help out people with cancer ."}
{"text":"Good brunch spot with an awesome story/cause.  We tried both of the benedicts and they were good.  Not the best ever but perfectly good."}
{"text":"I ordered the avocado toast and it was amazing ! I love the mission of this restaurant to feed the cancer patients going thchemo.This is  a 100% nonprofit restaurant with amazing food and service"}
{"text":"Very happy to have a place like Joy bus diner in the neighborhood. Great relaxed atmosphere solid service and really good food. One unique thing about Joy bus is that it's a nonprofit restaurant. Profits are used to deliver meals and company to cancer patients. I had the roasted chili Benedict and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place makes me so happy. Their steak benedict is amazing and the staff is super nice. Most of the money goes to charity and cancer research. They make their food from donated stuff and its amazing. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice breakfast place"}
{"text":"I had the Reuben here and it was great. Even if it weren't I'd probably still come back just because of the cause they support."}
{"text":"Cute little place with a great vibe! Great service, great food and even greater purpose! Eat here often- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place! I went here because of the write up in uptown mag. It is a cozy and relaxed atmosphere. The food was good as was the service. I had the cobb and extra bread for a late lunch. The sald was good with a lot of bleu cheese and the fresh bread was very tasty. The only thing that would make their bread better is real butter. I will be back to try the fries...everyone was raving about them"}
{"text":"We love this place.  We love their mission, food and prices.  Service is inconsistent but we are always forgiving since some of the wait staff are volunteers.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Super cute and everything we have tried has been outstanding!! Probably the best tomato soup I have ever tasted, yummy salads and great sandwiches and fries! Everyone was so friendly, we will be back many times!"}
{"text":"I had the lox plate, which was amazing-four large caper berries on the stem, rings of red onions, cucumbers, vine ripened tomatoes, a hard boiled egg, lox, perfectly toasted crostini brushed with olive oil and more than enough cream cheese for the plating. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Quaint place with great story, friendly staff and yummy food. Would definitely recommend checking it out as I will be a returning patron."}
{"text":"I came here with my two-thirds of my littles and it was more than I expected. 100% of the proceeds go to The Joy Bus charity, which delivers meals to home bound cancer patients. I ordered the create your own omelet, I ordered the 2 egg breakfast for my little guy, and the chicken and waffles for my middle little. The potatoes that came with our plates were fantastic. The bread and jelly was good as well. The chicken and waffles were a hit by my pickiest eater. The OJ is freshly squeezed.   The wait time and a bit of confusion is to be a little expected. These are all volunteers and they are not waitresses by trade. If you are looking for 5 star service, don't come here. If you are looking for awesome food that is made with love, you have to try this place."}
{"text":"What a great spot. We wanted to try someplace new for breakfast so we came here. It's a quaint diner but had enough seating for those coming and leaving. We even stayed longer after finishing our meals and left when the tables became full.  The menu has enough options for everyone. I ordered the avocado toast, which comes with a poached egg, arugula, and tomatoes. I added some spice with Cholula and got a side of fruit to balance things out. I enjoyed my food and the prices are so affordable. I love that they are a nonprofit and have a greater mission than just serving people food. Service was great as well, they asked to fill our drinks several times. We also got 10% off for checking in.   A note: it's easy to get to from off the 51, but to get back North you need to make a right and then U-turn or turn into a parking lot to go back west."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful brunch here!  I had the breakfast burrito that included chorizo AND my choice of bacon or sausage.  I went with bacon, of course.  I don't eat eggs, and I didn't feel like the burrito suffered without them.  It was very tasty and I was full when I was done.  My nephew got the biscuits and gravy, which were delicious!  Loved the flavor of the gravy.  Fast, friendly service as well.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. It's super casual but the food is very good and there are plenty of options. So even the picky eater will find something delicious. The best part of eating here is the profits go towards providing meals to home bound cancer patients."}
{"text":"Food is locally sourced and fresh. Menu is short, simple with some creative ideas per the cook. Best part is this is a location set up for charity inspired by a friend lost to Cancer. Very nice people, staff!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The grilled cheese is delicious and the tuna melt fresh and tasty. Service was awesome. Green tea flavored but not fake tasting. Plus all profits go to charity. Prices are just down right cheap!!!!!"}
{"text":"We saw they had great reviews and had to try it out when we moved closer to the location. We did not know that it was a nonprofit which is awesome! The staff is all volunteers and do a great job. The food was priced well. We got the chicken and waffles and the chicken burrito! Excellent!"}
{"text":"Food is always good and we are regular's and he people all donate there time to help and the money goes to a great cause as well."}
{"text":"Sunday late morning, we were seated immediately after signing in. Our server got us coffee and water and was very enthusiastic about what seemed like all of the things. It elated us. Talk about being in the right frame of mind.   We ended up with the 2 egg breakfast and the breakfast burrito with a special request of being smothered in the red chili sauce with cotija cheese.   This place is a real diner. They aren't trying to be anything fancy on their sturdy plates and the nondescript yellow mugs. That being said, my eggs over medium came out perfectly. The sausage patties were nicely seasoned, the potatoes had rosemary, and the toast came with fresh strawberry jam. The breakfast burrito was pretty large and also had the same rosemary potatoes within. Adding on the red chili sauce was a fantastic choice.   Considering the total amount was under twenty bucks for quality food made with purpose and it's close by, I'm most definitely coming back. What a great little spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast - I had the avo toast and a side of potatoes and the hubby had the muesli with fruit and both were yummy. Very reasonable prices. Will come again for sure."}
{"text":"Must try !!! Great quality, low prices,  amazing food !! My meal was 9$ & ...can't wait to tell more about this awesome little joint!! It's truly a win/win"}
{"text":"So pleased to stumble on this spot. Very good reasonable meal but the reward is knowing the cause it is supporting! My LEAST FAVORITE MEAL TO PAY FOR IS BREAKFAST! But this is well worth it and it comes with the spiritual boost. Ladies are lovely and happy to explain their mission. Please give it a try. Seems to have many regulars that are greeted warmly-always a good sign. These days there are endless places to eat and spend your money but this one has the side benefit of knowing it is DIRECTLY helping our community. This will now be part of our rotation. Started our weekend on a positive note!"}
{"text":"Best salad I have had in ages. Finally a healthy salad with good quality ingredients. I'm sick of the healthy salads costing $15. I paid $8 here and it tasted amazing. This is a hidden gem and would be a top restaurant in any city. The fact that they use their profits to provide meals to cancer patients makes it even better. Even if they didn't this would still get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant.  The things that matter... Food: well prepared, incredibly tasty, seamed to be made of fresh, high quality ingredients.  Service: Friendly, efficient, impeccable  The in"}
{"text":"Love the concept and the idea of my money going to charity. That being said, food was average at best. Hubs had the bisquits and gravy I had chicken and waffles. Both were just ok. Sausage side was so-so- chicken was overcooked and kinda dry. Almost forgot, the syrup they brought for my waffles was cold. Nothing like putting some ice cold syrup on hot waffles.  Our server seemed distracted with people coming in and dropping off supplies for a charity thing. All in all, we prob wont be back."}
{"text":"Awesome wanna your tummy to feel as good as your soul? Go here. Probably top 5 breakfast spot in phx"}
{"text":"Great little diner that serves locally grown produce. The service was very friendly and attentive, the coffee hot and tasty and wonderful eggs Benedict.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Enjoy great food & feel great about supporting a business thst makes a meaninful difference. Fresh food, incredibly reasonably priced, healthy eating that is yummy."}
{"text":"Absolutely a very special place to eat. Food was fresh and delicious, and the staff wAs friendly. Beautiful concept for opening this restaurant. I am a cancer survivor and was very touched by their mission to help others."}
{"text":"3/29/2017 Enjoy good food & feel great about supporting a business that makes a meaningful difference. Inspirational quotes create a feel good experience all around.  Fresh food, incredibly reasonably priced, and healthy eating that is yummy. Wish I lived here to come more often!"}
{"text":"So wonderful to support local and nonprofit businesses. Just what this area needs! The food, atmosphere and staff were amazing!!"}
{"text":"It felt like a very relaxed atmosphere when i first went inside this non-profit establishment. There was a straightforward menu presented to me after I chose my seating. It was morning and I've been on a breakfast kick, so naturally I leaned towards the breakfast burrito.   It was a decent size, but the tiny little salsa in the plastic cup was bland at best. Whoever made it should be ashamed.   The actually burrito was okay. I chose bacon over chorizo or sausage which I'd choose sausage if I ever went back.   Overall, friendly staff, okay food, decently quick kitchen: neutral. Not an over-the-top-spectacle but deff not the local Waffle House."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced.  It was like 12 dollars for 2 of us to have a sit down breakfast.  I was amazed!  I got the breakfast burrito and it was everything you would want it to be.  We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh organic meal! All profits go to delivery of meals to Cancer patients. Staff very friendly.  A must in PHX"}
{"text":"Came back again from Flagstaff and still just as good! This place has the best vibes and each staff member is very intentive and super friendly! Will continue to visit every time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Hard to find as very little signage, but that is only a detail. Another detail, the cause is wonderful, again, another detail. Aside from the altruistic reasons (which are great), the food is delicious. If you want to eat healthy, you can do it (not sure why). But if you want REAL food, it is here. The only problem, the prices are too low. Have a great meal, do something good for yourself and for someone else who doesn't have a choice."}
{"text":"Very nice people. Greeted and seated right away. Quick service. Great food. Very reasonable prices. Great cause"}
{"text":"I had never been to a nonprofit restaurant before - cute place with a great concept. My boyfriend and I both had the breakfast burrito and avocado toast, both were great. We were surprised on the serving size based on the price. Would go again if in the area"}
{"text":"Concept is great, food, not so much.  Very basic.  Pancakes are better at IHOP, which is sad.  French toast is made from their homemade bread, which is nothing to write home about.  Sunnyside up eggs were slimy.  Home fries had too much rosemary.  Toast comes dry and is cold before you can butter it.  Service is friendly, but amateur.  Place is small and cute.  Happy we went early to beat the line up.  On the plus side, prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Delicious avocado toast & the best pancakes! Excellent pricing plus everything tastes better when you know their mission is charity."}
{"text":"This is the second time in for breakfast. The food is great and I love the decor/ambience. The servers are volunteers who have great hearts, but are fairly inexperienced. Having worked in food service up to and throughout college, I expect that my water and coffee will be refilled (or at least offered) throughout my meal. I hate having to ask for refills each time I run out of water/coffee. I believe this could be a great little restaurant if there was some minimal supervision or training for volunteers.   Food : 5 stars, Mission: 5 stars, Service: 3.5-4.0 stars."}
{"text":"Finally a good breakfast/brunch spot in the hood! The menu has something for everyone.  I had the power bowl with salmon and it was very fresh and super tasty.  I can tell a lot of love and care is going into the food. The staff was super cool and friendly.   I am looking to coming here a lot for good food and 100% of the proceeds go to a good cause!   Welcome to the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"I love the concept behind this little diner. Home made food for a great cause. I loved my sandwich. The fries were crispy. The staff if friendly. 100% non profit."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast at 10 on a Saturday morning. Food was yummy and portioned just right. Service was great and each employee was attentive to all customers. This is a new fave for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great little place right off the 51-shea.. Lots of choices and good standard coffee.  Had standard eggs and toast but potatoes were excellent."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, craving a breakfast burrito. I heard this place was a non-profit restaurant, and I was thoroughly impressed with everything. The ambiance is upbeat, with happy music playing through the speakers, even at 7am on a weekday. On top of that, my waitress gave excellent customer service, always asking if I needed a refill on my coffee, giving great recommendations, and promptly bringing the check. The breakfast burrito had Tender Belly bacon in it, and oh my gosh, that bacon is SO good. The salsa isn't too bad, either. I was only there for a short time for breakfast, but can't beat the good vibes, and eating for a cause in this place - you will leave with a smile on your face."}
{"text":"Love this wonderful, warm and friendly spot for breakfast or lunch.  Food is insanely good--so fresh!  The avocado woods toast is AMAZING.  Love their tuna salad sandwich and their fries are incredible!  Omelettes great--salads phenomenal.  But best of all is the concept that their profits go to feed homebound cancer patients healthy gourmet meals delivered by a loving and compassionate volunteer force.  Most wait staff is volunteer, so please be patient if they are super busy.  You can decorate a brown shopping bag for meal delivery too, while you wait!  So happy to have this wonderful restaurant and people in our community!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. As thoughtful a concept for a restaurant as you will ever find. Profits earned at the Joy Bus Diner all go to The Joy Bus, a charity that provides meals and visits to cancer patients. How nice is that? Great food too!  The diner has made stylish use of what I think use to be a Pizza Hut delivery location. What an upgrade! Housed in a modest strip mall, signage is not great as of yet. If you're traveling north on the 51, exit at Shea and just make an immediate right into the first parking lot. Couldn't be more convenient.   We arrived at 8:45 on a Sunday morning. No wait. The line was out the door, however, less than a hour later when we departed. The restaurant is small. A counter with stools. Maybe ten tables. Nicely decorated. A wall with distressed wood honoring donors. Concrete floors. Industrial seating. Everything, especially the friendly service, is exceptional. Apparently some of the staff are volunteers, actual cancer survivors and former Joy Bus recipients. Take a walk down the hall toward the restroom and you'll find articles and awards detailing the history of The Joy Bus. The walk answered all our questions.  The restaurant serves breakfast and lunch items. We ordered pancakes, French toast, omelettes and a muesli special. We loved everything. Very reasonably priced. There is no kids menu per se, but a $5 cheese omelette (free veggies, $1 extra if you add a meat) was an economical solution for our crew. Yes, a $5 omelette! With potatoes! Coffee was refilled endlessly and often. A \"win\" all around.  We will definitely be back. Maybe chicken and waffles next time."}
{"text":"Got the veggies and eggs and my bf got eggs chorizo. Very fast service and everything had a homemade feel to it. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more than I did. Was not impressed with the service, tomato soup, or the atmosphere. I like that it's for a good cause. I probably would try it again and order something else. It just felt dark and depressing inside. It took a long time for a grilled cheese and soup. Really was a miss for me."}
{"text":"Great food great service and an even better cause.  My husband and I had eggs, pancakes, toast and those potatoes!! Yummy!! everything was very good. Support this place. It's cheap and good and all the profits go to cancer patients."}
{"text":"JBD is our go to spot now after we hike PHX Mountain Preserve on the weekends.  Everything I said in my prior review still stands x 10 fold. We have amazing food every visit and I can not get enough of their homemade biscuits (no rhyme intended).  While their biscuits and gravy is a hearty meal, their biscuits alone are the stuff of dreams.  They have substance without being too flour-y and have a rich, amazing smokey-ness to them.  All the hyphenated words to describe these biscuits. When I am 1 mile into our 3.5 mile hike, I just think about my Two Egg Combo add Biscuit instead of toast and I could hike to Piestewa Peak and back.  Great food behind an even greater action of helping those in need."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and really glad we did. Let me start by saying we were very touched by the story behind the restaurant and the inspiration for it. The menu  had some great choice and we went with the Benedict and the special of the day. So let me breakdown the pros and cons: Pros: The service was great the staff was really nice.  The food was delcious Prices were really reasonable and for a great cause Cons: Food was really slow coming out took a really long time for food and drinks Food was served all as it was ready, so some people were eating while others had to wait The pies are backed with tins that have to be returned so if you are from out of town (like us) you are out of luck on taking one home..  Overall good experience, would eat her again when we visit AZ."}
{"text":"10.21am place is packed. so far service quick friendly and im awaiting my my biscuits m gravy with a side of an over easy egg. We'll see...1036 still waiting outside...1041 arrived looks great...now i can say it tasted awesome, more gravy please!  Didn't finish cuz i can't eat that much fluffy biscuit rich sausageee gravy goodness.  Yep, head over for sure.  Nice  energy too."}
{"text":"The Joybus is a super cute cafe with tasty breakfast offerings. The first time I visited, I had their filet Benedict....The Chile hollandaise was delish and the eggs were perfect. The bread is a bit unusual....Very thick, but tasty. The potatoes that come with the meal were nice and crispy and well seasoned. My second visit I tried a regular Benedict sub bacon for the ham. It was good, but not nearly as good as the spicier version. Regardless, the food was good and reasonably priced (not to mention the restaurant is a non-profit which is pretty cool) so I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I had the privilege of meeting some great and gracious people today at a volunteer event.  This is a local business that is non profit with 100% of profits going back to delivering meals for people living with cancer.  Please check it out."}
{"text":"I love what they're doing here!  What are they doing, you ask?  Making seriously good breakfast for a great cause.  I was a little worried that the food would be sub-par because it's SUCH a tremendous charitable project, but it's definitely a solid place to eat on it's own.    As people before have said, all profits go to meals for those with cancer and other illnesses and many of the servers and workers are volunteers.  A really heartening project!  I hope they get a sign soon--it's a little hard to find, but if you're in the shopping center with Bootleggers, you are in the right place."}
{"text":"I primarily came here because I liked knowing that my eating out was gonna go toward helping people. You wonder if a charity restaurant might have only satisfactory food. But I found it wasn't the case here. I had their breakfast burrito which was pretty hefty and only $5.50. I know a lot of hipster places that will charge a lot more. I would love to go back and try some of their other food items. I sat at one of their two outdoor tables. They have a shade dangling from the overhang so you are plenty protected from the sun."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal and wonderful employees. Such a great mission this restaurant has.   We showed up 20 minutes before closing and they graciously welcomed us.   Husband had the fried chicken sandwich in a biscuit.   6 year old son has biscuits and gravy. He enjoyed them after he got over the paparika that was sprinkled in top.   I had the power bowl (or something named similar) I choose the salmon on top. I would opt to skip it next time. It was like the salmon you put on a bagel and cream cheese. I feel Irma wasn't the right texture. The dressing is awesome but spicy, be aware, there are jalapeños in it.    Excellent iced tea. It is donated so on a rotation."}
{"text":"Great diner with tons of charm! The atmosphere is inviting and we were greeted with a smile by the owner as soon as we walked in. The service was perfect and the food was amazing! And the fact that the profits from the diner go to such a worthy cause is more than enough reasons to make this place a must stop on your way through town!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time I was amazed at how good the food was and at such a reasonable cost.  This time was a disappointment. I asked for well cooked scrambled eggs and got soggy wet ones. The potatoes, that last time were to die for, were greasy and soggy. The biscuits from the bus incurs and gravy were tough to cut and last was the homemade lemonade, which needed lots of aid. It was sooo bitter, that we had to put sweetener in it to make it even bearable. I was very disappointed this time, but will be back at least once more in case today was a fluke.   In a side note, the service has been subpar both times, but because the prices are so low and it's a nonprofit, I can let it go.  Update:  Been back a third time.  Food was great, but the one horrible downside is that the coffee is HORRIBLE.  I have been a barista, so I know what good coffee is suppose to taste like.  This was horrendous.  So, don't go for the coffee, but for the food and a chance to help the non profit out."}
{"text":"A combination of incredibly savory food and a wonderful cause are definitely worth checking this place out. The menu has a good variety and the service is quick and friendly. A very cute atmosphere as well. I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"OK...I think the servers will remember me after reading this post.   First time eating here with some friends who have eaten here before.  We just finished a 12 mile American Cancer Society hike at South Mountain (my wife saw 5.5 miles and thought that was the total hike, nope, 5.5 was just to the top of the mountain).  We arrived and were greeting nicely and ordered our beverages.   We ordered the food and when it came out , my chicken and waffles didn't.  The server told me the ticket tore at the bottom and my order didn't get in.  She gave me a chocolate croissant and apologized profusely.   Another waitress went by and also apologized and said your order will be up shortly.  I didn't hear what this server said but our friend said biscuits and gravy as she went by.  I said it was chicken and waffles, but since she wasn't our server I wasn't concerned.   Well she told the cook to rush my biscuits and gravy.  It was then our server said no it was the chicken and waffles.  Again profusely apologizing for the mixup and said they would comp my breakfast, which wasn't necessary.   The food showed up as others were finishing their food and it was pipping hot.   The food...oh my goodness, the food was exceptional.  The chicken was crispy and very moist and just enough waffles.   It was truly worth the wait.   They did not charge me for my breakfast as they said, again, not necessary.   I never concern myself with human error, I judge this by how they acknowledge and respond to it.   Every server (3 of them) made a point of stopping and apologizing for the mixup with my order.   One actually said I hope it's not your first time here...I laughed and said it was and that I would write a Yelp review.    The Joy Bus is also a very good cause and donate their profits to feeding cancer patients who can't cook or prepare their own meals.  Go for the food and support a great cause all at the same time.  You won't be disappointed and they will see us again and again."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite diner for several reasons. The people, the mission, the food and the music is always excellent!  Jennifer makes a mighty dent in our life....my husband is a recipient of The Joy Bus love and there aren't words for how meaningful receiving this calibur of nutrition is to us. Living with cancer is hard. The Joy Bus makes it better."}
{"text":"So yes, the food is great, but the fact that this place is a nonprofit organization that delivers food to cancer patients is Simply Amazing. I ordered the  avocado woods toast. very reasonable prices, and you also get the opportunity to donate more money if you'd like."}
{"text":"The food is OUTSTANDING!! I'm starting with that statement because I want you to know that a trip to The Joy Bus Diner not only supports a GREAT non-profit, but you will truly enjoy the food, the atmosphere, and the price!! I would tell you their story, but it is better to hear the story while enjoying the food. So, get in there and find out what you are missing!!"}
{"text":"I simply cannot believe anybody would give this place a 5 star rating after the experience I just had there. We were the first people in a couple minutes after 7am I ordered the traditional eggs Benedict my wife the avocado woods toast. All of the poached eggs were beyond over cooked, they were hard. I don't think I even had a table spoon of hollandaise sauce on one off my eggs the other was dry.  We were the second people to get our food and our plates went to another couple first who had to turn back the attempted delivery before they remembered who was supposed to get the food. I could go on but I'll just say it was an all around bad experience. The cafe does much work for charity so maybe people feel obligated to give them a high rating. I'm happy to support any worthwhile charity but I went there for breakfast and left there still hungry and had to go get breakfast somewhere else. Never again will I go to that place. We give to charities and will continue to just not through horrible meals."}
