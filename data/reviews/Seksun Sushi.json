{"text":"Stopped in and placed an order to go. The new Manager was very helpful and made sure my order was just the way I wanted. While I waited the manager sat down and visited and was very nice.  When we got home my wife and I enjoyed the Vegas roll, egg roll, and crab puffs. The only thing I'll ask for the next visit will be more ell sauce on the Vegas rolls. Oh and there will be a next time.  Looks like a great place to stop in and have a drink and some delicious sushi ordered the way you want at a very fair price!"}
{"text":"Just went for lunch yesterday. Haven't been here in awhile and they have definitely stepped up their game. They now offer all you can eat sushi for $18 and have more help in the kitchen keeping the conveyor belt replenished. We went at 1230 so it was the perfect time to go. The waitress was attentive and kept our drinks full. They also have an extensive menu to order from, if you don't want conveyor belt sushi. On top of all of that, they give you a stamp card for free sushi. I love this place because you can get literally three times the selection for the same price. Meaning, you can try three times more rolls because they are served in smaller portions and you can get lots of different flavors/choices for the same price as you would spend elsewhere. Love it! Please support local businesses :)"}
{"text":"We have been looking for revolving sushi places since we got back from Hong Kong.  We found Teharu in Tempe and really liked it...at first, but after going back a few more times the charm of that place really started to fade. Everything from the seating, to the music, to the freshness of the sushi just seemed to be lacking more and more each visit.  I found Seksun on Yelp and had even driven up to this place before but I was a little put off by the parking lot...not very appealing...kind of deserted looking, and the place always looked empty, which is also off-putting, but my husband and I decided to finally get out of the car and go in and WOW we were so glad we did.  Hands down better then Teharu!!!  The seating is so much better, all tables, just the layout of the place is way better, has less of a \"Walmart\" vibe to it then Teharu does...and the sushi was very fresh  It's was so nice to be able to sit at a table and face each other and have a nice time. I like that all the sushi was clearly marked and listed what was in each item as they came around on the stainless steel conveyor. The waiter was super friendly. AND it's way closer then driving out to Tempe to be cramped up to the conveyor with very little elbow or table room!  I was even reluctant to write a good review cause I feel like it's our \"new secret place!\" but I also would like to see them stay around a while.  I really think that if the parking lot was more appealing, like Teharu's parking lot, this place would be crazy busy all the time."}
{"text":"Terrible - service is terrible - ordered some dishes from the menu  - mongolian beef and some assorted sushi - took about 40 minutes for them to bring it out - it was a slow night.   The waitress forgot about bringing the forks for the kiddos.  The food is terrible as well.  Go here if you like sushi rolls - basically, combinations of California rolls.  Skip the raw fish - it's not fresh - skip the entrees, unless you have a lot of time and like the taste of metallic.  Would have liked to have liked this place, but it's best to stay away.  If you want sushi go around, Teharu is better."}
{"text":"This is not worth $9.95 for me ! 5 pcs of yellow tail. Not coming back her for this ."}
{"text":"Prices are great. Food is really fresh.  Service was dead on. I go almost 3 times a week.   Always fresh and happy hour prices are awesome!!! A lot of food for your $$$.    Great for dine-in and carry out. I would recommend it to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time there. The customer service was great. The prices for the plates were reasonable. I will be coming back again for a third."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Japanese food at pricing that can't be beat. This is absolutely worth the drive from east Gilbert!  I'm currently pregnant,  and was able to order udon from the menu, and also picked up seaweed salad, inarisushi and sweet egg sushi from the conveyor belt. It was a fun experience,  and my husband was able to try many different things for half the price of traditional Japanese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"They are getting two stars just because the staff was friendly. Sushi was not fresh and the rolls all tasted the same."}
{"text":"This place is a joke and a disgrace to asian food, went there and ordered a dish, which was the wrong one!! Then they told me they were out of basil!!!! Can you believe that lie!! Manager never came to table! Bad business!! Dont waste your money and time, food tastes like dog food!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and limited sushi selection on the belt. Do yourself a favor and head over to Teharu sushi. Easier on the wallet and more selections. The restaurant does have a good ambience and atmosphere."}
{"text":"QUALITY: Arriving there on a slow Tuesday evening, we ordered: Edemami- could tell this crap was not fresh at all, very soggy as if its been sitting there all day.   Sushi- specialty roll, spicy tuna, spicy salmon, tuna hand-roll the presentation was mediocre, texture was a bit rough (probably old fish), the rice tasted old and wet, the salmon was VERY oily, like eating SLIME. Horrible..  Not to mention, as a health professional and health advocate; I try to eat very clean but,  never have I ever had abdominal cramping that lasted a few hours  **do not read for sensitive readers** In addition, I had experienced  explosive diarrhea that lasted for hours.. I eat raw foods as well as sushi 2-3 times per wk and I've never once had to experience this. This tells you that, preparation and quality of the sushi is not great at all.  ORIGINALITY:  nothing special, mediocre   SERVICE: we were the only people there and another couple, literally waited for 30 minutes for just sushimi and another 10 for the rolls. Looking at the \"see through glass\" of the sushi chefs, they appeared to be talking among themselves before actually preparing our food. Very unprofessional.   We were seated after standing awkwardly for a few minutes even when it was dead empty. After sitting there for a while,  had to ASK for our water. didn't get a refill when water was empty. after eating..  we waited another 10 minutes just for the check, we literally just walked up to the front where the manger was sitting, he was not doing anything and drinking on the job? a sake-bomb.   Hands over check, reacts as if it was not his problem, tries to pass this simple task to waiter, but waiter was busy doing something else...manager came off very arrogant and acted like a complete douche. Finally got the check, had a large bill- said they didn't have change, without even checking the register.. We were already fed up with the B.S. we said screw it and left.  TIPPED 110%! it  wasn't even deserved, they made no effort at all to satisfy their customers. First and LAST TIME coming here.   Very poor business practices. Lack of professionalism. With the way things are going if unchanged, this place might not last long...  recommendation to management: address concerns above, but more than likely we will not return due to the incident(s) presented"}
{"text":"Awesome specials and friendly staff! I come back regularly to take advantage of the happy hour."}
{"text":"New sushi-go-round! Woot! Wonderful sushi, comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff. The manager's attention to detail and quality really shows! Ask about the \"plate challenge\" ;)"}
{"text":"This place might now look like much... but the Sushi was AWESOME!  Very fresh!  This is the 1st time I went to a sushi bar and spent more on Alcohol then fish.  Prices are the best I have seen for sushi.  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Watch out your credit card!! VERY BAD experience! Went there last week with a friend....Yesterday I realized they charged me three times for a single meal, had to dispute to get money back. I thought they are not doing this on purpose, but found they also charged more tips on my friend's card.... Never go there again...."}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch here today (Saturday) based on Yelp reviews. Two other people were here when we arrived, and when we left we were the only people in the restaurant.  The staff seemed very authentic, prompt, and attentive (all two of them - the chef and hostess.) The go-round plates were overall fine, but there wasn't a big selection (understandable considering only a couple customers) and it seemed like half the offerings were black ($3 plates, or $1 per piece). The \"Wild Tiger\" and Philly roll were very good.  The recommended \"Lava Roll\" was wonderfully artful, but didn't look worth the price for the budget-minded. The actual menu also looked well-put-together, but we didn't use it.  If I lived in the Chandler/Gilbert area, I'd go back to Seksun again for the sushi or a look at their affordable entrees.  Where I currently live, I'd prefer to go north for Bei's lunch specials or Sushi Station for the bigger, faster-turnover conveyor belt."}
{"text":"I love this place! The sashimi is so fresh and they always give you such big pieces. I also love the tuna tataki, which has a taste that is gourmet-like with a wonderful blend of lemon and spices in it. My boyfriend and I only go to this sushi place now for our sushi needs."}
{"text":"I am bewildered by Seksun's good or even decent reviews. It was right around the corner from where I was, so I came here for lunch. I ate the sushi off the conveyer belt (though there was only rolls, edamame, and desert on it) but I didn't enjoy it. The rolls come around with only three pieces, which would have been nice because I could have tried several things, if there had been any variety of sushi or if it had been edible. I tried the Flash Star Roll, and it just tasted off. Then I tried a Spicy Tuna Roll but I couldn't even finish it due to the fishy flavor. The rice was also very gummy. In the end, I thought I would be safe with the edamame, but even that tasted like it had sat around for ages. I immediately got the check and left hungry. The server was prompt with my bill, but I was one of only two tables in the restaurant that was occupied. My bill was less than $7 but I would never come back here considering the other and far better sushi options in Chandler."}
{"text":"When my g/f and I walked in, we instantly noticed the place was empty.  There was only one other table during the entire lunch hour! Yikies.  Not good.  The rolls on the conveyor belt were also pretty sparce.  Our first impressions were that we probably wouldn't be back.  I grabbed a spicy tuna roll off of the conveyor belt and was an instant convert - so fresh!  Yum!  The very friendly hostess/waitress readily took our order for sushi that wasn't on the conveyor belt - rainbow roll, maguru tuna and I can't remember what else.  What I do remember was the exquisite melt in your mouth freshness.  I am not sure why word hasn't leaked out about this place as there should be a line-up out the door.  I do admit that the location isn't the best (tucked in the strip mall across from Skateland but, we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've had sushi and Chinese food all around the East Valley and this is some of the best tasting food I've had!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went to Seksun for lunch around 11:40 am on a Sunday.  Only 4 other people were there.  I was a little disappointed in the size of the sushi and unfortunately the same sushi and rolls kept coming around on the belt.  We also noticed the $2 and $3 plates out numbered the $1 & $1.50.  The squid salad had a nice taste, but not much squid, same with the octopus salad.  I did order Salmon roe and for $2.50 was very good.  I can't say that I'd go back because other places offer better size and quality, like Teharu (which has terrible service).  I'd say try it for  your self before you judge the place.   The service was good and our waitress tried very hard to assist."}
{"text":"First time in, drove past a couple of times, should have stopped sooner!  Great service and the people were very friendly!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Love most of the sushi, rolls and small appitizers we have tried and you can really tell the sushi is fresh. Also the employees are very nice and prices are good. But thats where it ends... They dont serve alcohol... They dont carry some of things that are on the menu... And The service is really slow. How can you have 1 server working at 7 and expect to provide quality service. Also i agree with the previous poster... Feels like a cafeteria, and i dont know why they didnt put in a patio. Ill still give them another try but not for awhile so they can hopefully get the kinks worked out by then since they did just open."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  GOOD AND COLD SUSHI!  Great customer service!  Great atmosphere!  I will never go to any sushi place besides this one!!"}
{"text":"Sushi on a conveyor, kitschy I guess.  I was first to arrive @ lunchtime today.  Hostess smiled & we struggled through a brief conversation as English wasn't her first language.  But still nice enough.  It was fun.  This type of dining would be especially useful for bringing someone who is new to sushi as you get a birds eye view of what you can try.  Or perhaps the kids.  I am sure all the shorties will crack up when they see the sushi chugging along around the seated patrons.   I am an unagi fan & there was very little of this.  After I grabbed the couple of plates of the caterpillar rolls that was it.  I tried the spicy California rolls & enjoyed these as well.   All in all a nice dining experience & a lot of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Really great service. Love the ambience of this place. It's so rare to find a sushi train here and we found it! Would definitely recommend dropping by when you get a chance! Make sure to order the las vegas roll!"}
{"text":"super great service and even better sushi!!! highly recommend if you like revolving sushi places. prices are great too"}
{"text":"I am impressed by their good food and great service.  Waitresses are always friendly and attentive to our needs. The conveyor belt is  well replenished with fresh and delicious sushi. A great place to have a drink with friends.  Very clean and reasonably priced. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Overall good experience. Sushi was really good, I also enjoy some hot sake to go with that lovely meal. The waitress could have brought us a high chair like we asked sooner, but eventually the other waitress went and grabbed one for us. Not fun holding a 30lb baby for 2 minutes. I had an overall good experience here. Both waitresses wee very kind and loved my lil baby. Pricing is by the plate 18 bucks a person from a certain hours. I went with the individual plate pricing. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We came in during mid afternoon, knowing that sometimes belt sushi is not as fresh, BUT it was very fresh, and there was great flavor.  Plenty of options just on the belt, as well. We would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Great place to have sushi the staff is very helpful. I realy like this place and do not understand why the bad reviews. If you do not like the sushi that is on the revolving belt then you can order from the menu. The food is price right and this is now my favorite place for lunch. They will be having alcohol they just need to apply for their license."}
{"text":"Seksun is our neighborhood sushi stop. Great for a quick bite or to stay and have a drink. I love the Mongolian beef dinner and my fiancé enjoys the Love of Salmon roll. I also love the firecracker appetizer!!  Aside from good food, there is something to be said for great service. We are always greeted with friendly smiles and appreciate their attention to us as customers.   Very clean and very reasonably priced!!"}
{"text":"Good, cheap sushi.    Any time the sushi \"goes round\" there's a little bit of a question about freshness, but from what I can tell, the rotation is pretty solid.  I haven't had anything that didn't seem like it was the right temperature.  I like conveyer belt sushi because I can get 2-3 pieces of sushi without committing to an entire roll.  This is the time to try something new!  I like the color-coded plate system so I'm not surprised by my bill at the end.  But be careful, the purple plates look awfully close to white when they're directly under the light.  It's easy to tell the difference when you realize that there aren't many options for the white ($1) plates.  The crab puffs are some of the best I've ever had.  During Happy Hour they come .99 cents for a plate of 2, and I definitely need at least 2 puffs for myself.    I've had mixed results with communication with the servers; some speak very little english but I've met some native english-speaking (yet still asian) employees.  Either way, service has always been prompt and friendly, quick with drink refills.  The times I've ordered something from the menu, it came out hot and fast.  While this isn't the best sushi in town (except for the crab puff...that might be the best), it's a great value for what you get.  If you come during happy hour your bang is even bigger for your buck.  Seksun is a solid choice for a quick sushi fix."}
{"text":"We've been here twice so far. The food is yummy! If you order any of the soups...they are huge! Service has always been kind and helpful."}
{"text":"My best friend and I were looking for a good sushi place to eat for lunch and I went on Yelp to get some feedback.  I decided to go with Seksun.  We had a blast!!  Chris the manager was so kind and very helpful explaining how the \"sushi train\" worked.  The food was fresh and so yummy!!  The prices are perfect as well.  We will be back there very soon."}
{"text":"The food was alright, it really depends on where you sit in comparison to other tables. By the time food got around to us, there weren't many pieces left and it all sort of tasted the same. The spicy tuna I got, wasn't cold but luke-warm. When we got our check, they had overcharged our friend by two plates. They were quick to try and fix it, but the ended up adding the two plates to ours. Just a bit frustrating."}
{"text":"I have gone here 4 times now and the food is awesome. It is fresh and delicious. Very clean and the staff is very attentive and friendly. Love the ground, it's hard to stop eating. They also have made to order Chinese food as well."}
{"text":"We actually went to this place a while back but I am just now getting to the review.  I have to say that I was very reluctant to go to this place but after a friend recommended it several times, my wife and I decided to give it a try.  The concept of a \"sushi-go-round\" place was new to me and to be honest, somewhat frightening.  How can the sushi stay fresh while making laps on a conveyor belt?  I have to say I was surprised at how fresh the sushi was.  My wife loved the variety.  The neat thing was, when one type of sushi was gone a different one was put in it's place.   You pay by the different color plates, ranging from $3 to $1 per plate.  Here are a couple of the things that I did not like.  1 - the service was just ok at best.  They leave the plates on the table until you are ready to pay.  I would have preferred them to just take them away and run a tab. 2 - When I go into a sushi place I like to have the tablets of paper that you fill out when you order.  This way you can make adjustments or special requests rather than trying to explain it.  Not sure we will go back, but I guess we will see."}
{"text":"So I came back today, a week later, and it Was kind of disappointing when I didn't  see them making new dishes. I sat and literally waited and counted the dishes going round and round and NO NEW DISHES!! I saw there were sushi chefs behind the window rolling and making... But no new dishes! I felt like they are waiting for ppl to finish off what's on the revolver belt before they put more new ones out. No wonder the first time I came the rolls with sashimi on top were looking dry. The whole time I was there this time.. Like 30-40 mins.. No one touched them and they kept rolling around without additional rolls. I think I'm going to stick to ordering the specialty rolls and stay away from the sushi-go-round"}
{"text":"We went mid-afternoon on a Sunday, which is the only mitigating factor. The sushi wasn't terrible, but it was incredibly mediocre. There was not much variety. We had a special order of unagi which, despite being made to order, tasted like it had been sitting for hours. Couple all this with the fact that the price is on the high end for a neighborhood sushi restaurant, and this is one place I won't be eating again."}
{"text":"Honestly my first visit to Seksun wasn't great. We were one of only two tables on a Saturday afternoon, but the service was slow and kind of strange--bringing one water refill when we were all empty, forgetting to put in an order, etc.  The sushi quality was mediocre and didn't taste all that fresh, as though the plates had been on the conveyor belt for quite some time.   It's about a half a block from my house, so I figured I'd continue to go occasionally but not make it a regular thing.  A few weeks ago, though, Seksun had a \"free sushi night\" where everything on the conveyor belt was on the house. (It definitely helped that our table was right next to the kitchen!) This time the sushi was fresh, the restaurant was fully staffed with friendly servers, and there was music playing. Since this time, I've had nothing but good experiences at Seksun. I think they've sorted out a lot of the issues many other reviewers and myself have mentioned, so my roommates and I have started eating there fairly often. We usually have a really awesome server, Frank, who is really friendly and usually pretty fast.  The food quality has definitely gotten better, especially if you order if from the menu instead of waiting for it on the conveyor belt. I also tried some of their umeshuu (plum wine) which is delicious! I'd definitely recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place on Ray many times and only recently did it register in my skull that this was a kaiten-zushi (????/??????) place. I think I always saw the Seksun Sushi part and never really noticed the \"goround\" part of it. Came here a few days back with a co-worker for lunch. Wasn't crowded at all - only one of the conveyor belts was going. Pretty much everything on the belt was some kind of roll. Don't remember any actual sushi in the rotation the whole time I was there - just rolls of all sorts. Maybe we came at an off time and since there weren't that many people there wasn't a lot of turnover in selection. They also had a bunch of desserts in the rotation - mango pudding, jellos of all different colors but they were taking up valuable real estate on the belt that could have been populated with better sushi. I was kinda disappointed but I decided to go ahead and \"roll with it.\" Since I'm not really a \"roller\" can't even remember the names of them all. Co-worker on the other hand, is totally a \"roller\" and would be perfectly happy with the omakase from Safeway to tell you the truth. We'll probably come back just because it's closer than Teharu and cheap. In a lot by itself so parking is no concern at all."}
{"text":"Come here a lot for many special occasion because they have big space for parties. The eel hand rolls and salmon sashimi is pretty tasty here. The food overall are pretty good and would definitely come back again! :)"}
{"text":"A friend and I visited Seksun Sushi for girls night.  Disappointed there was no liquor, but they said it was coming Aug. 1st.  I thought the belt design the sushi came around on was fun.  However, they should offer more choices on the belt so you don't have to wait for fresh rolled.  Our server was VERY scattered and overwhelmed.  However, Kenny, the manager is AWESOME!  I didn't notice that the decor was bad or good.  Thought the \"$1 Sushi\" was a little misleading.  They have $1 3 piece California rolls or $1 edamame.  I will be back and give this place another shot...after they have liquor :)"}
{"text":"I went here for Mothers Day, very disappointed. The place was nearly empty and now I know why. No variety in sushi, they all tasted the same. The sushi at the grocery stores tastes fresher. The tempura was horrible, it was not proper tempura batter, it was heavy and greasy. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place! My friend and I go at least once a week sometimes two X) We are always greeted with a smile and most the servers and the manager/owner lady already know our order by heart. Which usually always includes california roll, crunchy rock & roll or las vegas roll, bubble gump roll, yellowtail, and some other rolls my friend gets. They are always delicious and never take too long. We always order off the menu and I figure that's best, I have had things off the conveyor belt and they are okay. Also great prices compared to a lot of other sushi places in the area we have been to. Oh yah Pad thai is also great!"}
{"text":"This place place is bomb. And cheap! I mean cheapppp! Plates are priced 1.50-4 max! If u want a roll that isn't on the conveyor belt then just ask to have some fresh ones made. I've tried everything in here some is great some eg not so much. But the price is what is really great. Where else you going to eat 30 rolls for 20 bucks with a tip."}
{"text":"I usually like this place and the food is good just a warning never tell the waitress that your food is salty specifically the beef and long noodle dish. I've had this before it was salty and I didn't ask to take it back I asked if I could have some vegetables to takw a2ay or better blend the saltiness.  10 minutes go by ,20 minutes go by,  I see at least two people who just walked in and get their food before I get my vegetables .  30 minutes goodbye the waitress comes by and says I put the order in I'll check on it they'll be out and finally 40 minutes go by no vegetables. The chef never did cook the vegetables.   In the meantime the chef has walked past our table speaking in his native language continuing to look at me and making it very clear that he is upset that I guess I said his dish was salty. I need the waitress knew that that was wrong and did take the entree off of our bill but that was just unnecessary.   Everyone's taste is different I don't care what you say it was salty and even my boyfriend agreed. If all your food is good and and all I wanted was some vegetables which you could have even made more money by charging me a little fee you need to take that somewhere.   Like I said they have good food my boyfriend wants to go there despite me feeling disrespected and I'm really contemplating. As much as I go there there should be better treatment but we'll see 2 Stars for being salty in food and an attitude. Different cook better attitude.  I went 3.5"}
{"text":"Great place,  good food and a great selection .  Very well organized and I would recommend this place to anyone.  I am visiting here from Washington where we have a TON of these restruants and this one is by far one of the best.  So go in and have a great meal."}
{"text":"Staff here is always super nice. They are always eager to serve you and make sure that you are satisfied with your order. Everything here is made fresh so sometimes you may have to wait longer to get your food.  You can order your food to go online and get a 5% off discount."}
{"text":"These guys are only 1/2 a mile from my house so my mom and I have made them a regular stomping ground.  What I love about them is that they are QUICK so if you wanna grab some quick grub for lunch/ dinner you can since all the food is on a conveyor belt. This is not a franchised restaurant, it's a mom & pop shop with Japanese chefs in the back which you can see btw through the glass wall.  Sounds silly but it makes it feel more authentic to me.  Prices? They are not bad.. they range from $1-$3 for a plate of 3 rolls. Good luck finding good sushi elsewhere for that price ;)  If you don't like the conveyor belt you can also order a-la-carte from the menu. Lastly I found the quality of the sushi to be pretty good for the price.  One would think you would get pretty crappy sushi for the price but it's actually good. They also have their own in-house inventions such as the \"Japanese Pizza sushi\"    Pros: Good sushi for a low price allows you to be adventurous and try out different types of sushi you haven't tried before. Yummy Green tea (specially when ordered hot) You can eat fast-n-go  Cons: Small wait staff but usually this isn't an issue Mostly sushi on menu - not much alternatives but then again it IS a sushi bar"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Great food and service. Awesome ambiance, and very sanitary. It's on par with Teharu, but much closer to me!  I've been to the restaurant twice. On the first time, I just had the safer rolls that I'm used to, but on the second time I tried a few new things. Everything was well prepared and delicious. The price was worth it, and about what I expected. The conveyor belt makes the experience much more fun. Traditional lanterns and artwork make the experience feel more holistic. This will definitely be my new go-to sushi place."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love coming here with my family. The sushi tastes good and is much better than other conveyer belt places that I have been to. The staff was very friendly and if you do not like the conveyer belt, you can just order your sushi so it is made fresh."}
{"text":"Stale, gross, awful food. The fish was stale plain and simple, it was like the sushi you'd find in a grocery store but more stale and dry. I had the tuna and the salmon and it was terrible, had no flavor, no quality, just cheap generic sushi.  There is little variety, its the same 4 or 5 little rolls rolling around ever 2 minutes, and it gets boring real fast.   The tempura was awful, it was a weird mix of fried bell peppers, those rip off slivers of potatos, and a few dry broccoli, one of the worst tempuras I have ever had.  The real put off for me was the big open glass to the kitchen. You can see the guys in the back just standing around talking to each other, barely working, just taking their sweet time and not putting on any effort or charisma. They also stare at you if you are sitting nearby, that uncomfortable kind of \"what you want to eat next\" kind of stare...you know? Arms crossed, standing stiff, no smiles, nothing, just awkward waiting around you to grab one so they can remake it. I was very uncomfortable and even wanted to move because of it, I hate people staring at me when I EAT!  The decoration and atmosphere is ugly, like 70's ugly. Avocado green and orange colors, cheap awful furniture, and that whole 70's look which is just unattractive.  I gave it a try but it was just bad, like cheap dollar store bad. Really. I have had bad sushi and sashimi before, I've even had chinese buffet sushi, and this was pretty much the same thing but dryer.  If you appreciate good seafood and tasty sushi, you will be sorely dissapointed by this place. Go elsewhere, seriously. In terms of quality and taste, this place is a drive through, other places like blue wasabi or mikado are a real dining experience."}
{"text":"The food was great; there is a moving belt that brings sushi past several tables and the customers grab what they want.  Should be very simple for the wait staff to provide great service, especially since we were the only table in the entire restaurant. I believe, in all my years of eating out, and we do eat out A LOT, this was the worst customer service we ever received.  The waitress was cranky when she sat us, she acted annoyed when she took our drink order and she was down right rude when my aunt asked one question about the menu. Perhaps she was upset that they were not busy at 7 PM on a Thursday night, there was literally one other occupied table and they were leaving by the time we were served our drinks.  The waitress asked us to repeat our drink order, which was not overwhelming since there were only four of us.  It must have been the glasses of water we ordered, along with two (identical) beers and one glass of wine. As we were grabbing and eating several different plates from the sushi belt, our waitress came back with our drinks.  Shortly after delivering them she asked to take our order.  I am not sure what set her off, but when my aunt asked one question: what type of vegetable were in the Chicken and Vegetable plate, her reply was \"I don't know, broccoli I think and some sprouts.  I don't know, I am a vegetarian and don't eat the food. I just serve it.\" I'm not sure what you think, however, I would think someone who claims to be a vegetarian WOULD know what type of veggies are in the dishes. It is no wonder that the place was empty.  My husband and Uncle had the Mongolian Beef, which was very good.  The chicken a vegetable plate was good; nice sauce, fresh veggies, unfortunately the chicken was only so- so."}
{"text":"This is our goto for Sushi , while not as fancy as some, it is excellent! The sushi belt is what we always order of. We became regulars here, and it's wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! And the food was fresh and delicious. Our waiter was super friendly and even turned up the volume on the TV for us to watch a show we were interested in. Highly recommend this place to anyone that loves sushi!"}
{"text":"My go to sushi joint! The conveyor belt is so fun and the sushi is delicious. We recently visited Teharu, another rotating sushi bar but it didn't compare with the freshness of Seksun."}
{"text":"My wife and I have gone back several times and now that they have new manager the experience has been positive. The owner is a sweetheart! I like to sit right where the sushi comes out to grab the freshest plates made..hahaha I turn into a little kid when it comes to sushi. Try Seksun..good food, good prices and a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My experience with Seksun was just ok. It was Friday night at 6pm the place was dead. I saw the conveyor belt, probably a 2 minutes loop compared with what we had before a 6 minutes loop in Oregon this belt felt short. The same 10 dishes were going around and around. I ordered some hamachi sashimi, fried veggie spring rolls and 2 spicy hand rolls because the belt selection was very limited."}
{"text":"First time sitting in for dinner, and had a great time pulling plates off the rotating belt. I dont eat sushi a lot so it was great to try different ones. I like that they offer other meat dinners as well."}
{"text":"Well all I can say is this place needs several things  1. Sushi is eh...tried the conveyor and were very cautious about what we selected  2. Waitress needed lessons on how to waitress.  Maybe making eye contact with someone as you set the plate down so the food doesn't tip off of it   3. And probably the most important - clean this place!!  Food stuck to the side of the belt (it was dried so it looked like it had been there a while), decor looked cheesy.  Take off all of the poster board and photos (no one cares), wipe off and clean everything from top to bottom.  The one good thing was the fried rice - our child loved it."}
{"text":"As a first time customer, they made a bad first impression. An hour 30 minutes for my meal to get delivered. With simple instructions; address, name of apartment, where we were waiting. And the food I think was the worst part. I usually never write a bad review but this was a bad first experience."}
{"text":"I really love coming here with the family.  Very affordable for a family of 5.  They are very friendly and attentive to your needs.  If you don't see anything on the conveyor belt they will be happy to order it for you in the kitchen.  Their are many TVs so you can watch whatever sports game is playing.  The last time we were there, it was early in the afternoon so there wasn't a big game on and we were watching car racing in the dirt and of course my four year old was loving it.  If your into cheap sushi, cheap meaning price not quality, you need to go here with the family."}
{"text":"Friendly service, delicious food, fast, easy, and affordable! Every piece of sushi we had there was awesome. We definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"So Im a die hard sushi fan and so is my boyfriend so we where excited to try this place out cuz we heard it was a sushi go around . We actually where on the way to my fav sushi spot but we decided to try this because we heard about it from a few people. Oh boy did we make a mistake coming in. Went in to a completely empty restaurant and literally everything on the belt look old which sucked because that's mostly the reason why we came here. All the fish looked brown and dis colored and even the avocado which means it was sitting there idk how long so I stayed away from it.  My boyfriend and I decided to order off the menu instead. We got the miso soup to start and it was so cold! The rolls we got was the dynamite and some roll with salmon and salmon nigiri . The dynamite had way to much artificial crab and when I tried picking it up the roll fell apart instantly  which means the sushi rice wasn't good.  And I found that to be a problem on my salmon nigiri too. The salmon roll had lemon on it with was weird and gave it a weird taste so I took it off. But even after taking it off the roll tasted off. My favorite kind of sushi is anything with raw salmon and this roll just made me lose my appetite. I left like almost half the roll because it just tasted so bad to me. Sucks because I really wanted some sushi tonight and after eating here I was really disappointed because I left hungry but yet kinda grossed out......"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery- Food was delivered in a timely fashion and the people were friendly however I found that the sushi that I have gotten from other establishments didn't taste as fishy as it did from here. I wasn't really impressed and didn't eat but two pieces of the roll. Gyoza was good but you can't really mess that up.. Firecracker appetizers are shown cut up in small pieces on this site but came as huge pieces that were not cut up and a little difficult to eat. I wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"The sushi and the service are sub-par but if you are looking for a different take on date night, revolving sushi fun to experience at least once. I wouldn't recommend staying too long though, every time we have gone they seem to have the same playlist of 15 songs on repeat. It's enough to drive you crazy."}
{"text":"While I like the concept, BUT this place scares me.   All the seating was stained and dirty. It needs a good steam clean or recovering to something that CAN be wiped down.  They have a sushi-go-round conveyer belt that is NOT CHILLED. We watched the same pieces of sushi go around for over an hour and not be removed. That seems a bit dangerous to me to leave raw fish out that long.  The service was meh. Good at first but then non-existent. Dirty glasses were given to us for our beers. We had another person join our party and had to flag someone down for service after they were there for 10+ minutes. --- I don't get this as there were three servers and only half of the restaurant was open, it wasn't very busy.  I will not return to this location for fear of being sick, my stomach was unsettled and I felt like I should warn the new patrons coming in to dine. I did mouth \"order from the menu\" but, I'm not sure he/they got the message.  Its a shame really, such great potential in this location, it just scares me too much to take a chance and return."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good variety, fresh and delicious food, great value with happy hour 7 days a week. Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"Ok, it's a big jump from my last review, and I know I said it was my last time going, but what can I say?  We really did love this place.   So I got rid of my jerk face (yes, that is an adult term) fiancé but we decided to stay friends- because that idea always works.  So, for old time sake we wanted go back to \"our spot\" for a friendly dinner.  Keeping up with the T.M.I. of this story, we got into a huge argument at the restaurant, and we haven't spoken since, but that aside...  The food was GREAT!  As I mentioned in my last review we would go to this place 2-3x's/week so when the wait staff saw us walk in, when we hadn't been there for nearly 3 months, they treated us like royalty.    We were seated at the best seat in the house- at the beginning of the conveyor belt where you can see the rolls being made AND you get first dibs on fresh ones.  Our crab puff appetizers came out within just a few minutes and were so hot I had to let mine cool off.  They remembered that we ordered rolls with soy paper and the waitress even remembered one of the rolls we always got.  The seaweed salad off the belt was crisp and cold, the rolls were cold too.  But best of all, our special order of soy paper sushi rolls came out just as ordered and all of our food came out together.  WE ACTUALLY GOT TO EAT OUR DINNER AT THE SAME TIME!    Thanks Seksun for redeeming yourself.  I will be back soon.  And next time I will be jerk face free."}
{"text":"This place kicks serious ass! Been here a lot and it never disappoints. Rolls rock and the firecrackers are amazing. The service is impeccable, friendly and engaging. Anyone that says differently should be roundhouse kicked in the face. As for management that \"acts like they literally own the place\", well, he must have caught you on a bad day."}
{"text":"Good, fresh sushi.  Don't know why it has 3.5 stars.  My only complaint is that the white wine was warm but she brought me ice.  I would come back."}
{"text":"First time here and we will be back. Though a few mistakes were made with our order, the staff here more than made up for it with their great attitude. Food was as expected, nothing really out of the ordinary for a sushi place, but the menu was very extensive with things like chicken satay and a variety of choices that expanded beyond Japanese food. I look forward to coming back and trying new things."}
{"text":"WHO OWN'S THIS PLACE?!?!So sad!! I tried this place night last night and it was wonderful. Had soup, sushi and gyozas. So good that I tried using online ordering to order lunch today. There was no availability to order on line for takeout. Says you get a 5% discount when you do. So I call. I order off the menu salt and pepper calamari, wonton soup, and California roll. The woman on the phone could not find calamari on her computer screen so I couldn't order that. By the time we tried to understand each other, I was almost at rest by then. Got there, I showed her on her own menu, she then again looked on comp screen and said she couldn't find it , so I couldn't order that item  anymore. Then asked for the wonton noodle soup and California roll. Right before paying,  (which took 5 min in front of her, due to personal phone call and 2 bus calls) she told me that the wontons were not there and that the truck is on its way?!?! Are you kidding me? She said it would take 15 min for it to even come and then they would have to make!! This is at 1130 lunch time!!!! I took back my money and left. There's a lot of good sushi places that have better cust service and have their stuff together. It's to bad because I thought we had a new place to go for family dinners. DONT GO!!"}
{"text":"We drove by and saw this new sushi place and thought to try it tonight.  First thing I thought when I walked in - where's the decor? It's very sterile and cafeteria looking inside.  Kinda similar to a yogi's grill but with more seating. There is no patio however there is space for one which I thought was odd since it could be used for outside seating.  It's a cheap sushi place but the cheap price has to do with their rolls only being 2-3 pieces and not the usual 6-8. Portion control maybe? It gives you the option of ordering several different rolls(of 2 pieces or 3 pieces).  If you calculate the # of rolls you have to order to get the same number of pieces for a real sized roll it's just slightly cheaper than other sushi restaurants.  I was not impressed and honestly will probably never go back. I'll be surprised if this place is around in 6 months. I would like to see a better atmosphere as it feels almost fast foodish."}
{"text":"It was okay. We came in during their happy hour and were the only party there. The conveyor belt was full of sushi, but you could tell it was sitting there for a while, so we were skeptical. Room temperature raw fish is never advisable... So we were turned off by the food already.  Besides the low quality of the fish, I was also disappointed that most if the rolls had crab in it; I'm not a fan of the taste and texture. But if you enjoy california rolls, then a number of these rolls may appease your appetite."}
{"text":"Decent sushi, good prices. Not really any kid-friendly fare, but what do you expect for a sushi-centric place?"}
{"text":"The first thing I think about when I think about good sushi is this place. I can always trust their food, nice environment, and great staff!!!"}
{"text":"Love the conveyor belt style  You get to try a little of everything  Lava roll, wild tiger, yummm"}
{"text":"GREAT and CHEAP sushi love the stamp card system, have to try the wild tiger roll and the lava roll!!!!! :D"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this restaurant a try, since it's new and I wanted to give them my business. I was NOT impressed in the least. The sushi was OK.. I did order some Salmon  Roe which I like to have with Quail eggs. I was told that the Quail eggs were \"not in season.\".Well, I have NEVER heard THAT before, but so be it. Then I had ordered some Ama ebi.. The sushi came with 2 tiny shrimp wrapped around each peace of sushi and the heads, which are usually deep fried, were MIA..  Service was nothing to email home about, although they were truly not busy at all. I had to get the server's attention more than once. I will stick  to my Taiko, which is the same distance to my home, just the on the opposite way. Taiko is awesome and service is great."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna step in to this place anymore. This place has serious management issues. Food is Ok when sushis are fresh but most of the times sushis are not fresh and specially items on the rollers seems to be there for days. One night I and my girlfriend went to this place and there were bunch of drunk mexican guys drinking and laughing at the bar. They were so loud an disrespectful. There were pointing other guests and making fun of them. To be honest I was a little afraid and just wanted to walk away since those guys were behaving like crazy. But the most annoying part was the owner lady was flirting with these guys and seemed just care to recieve more tip. She was just bevaving like she is part of that drunk gang. So disrespecful and unprofessional. I couldn't believe my eyes there.  And finally last night I went there to order togo since all other plcaes were closed. I ordered beef curry with rice but when I opened the box when I got home I saw some Thai noodles. They really take advantage of their customers. Not walk in to this place even if It's the last place in the world"}
{"text":"My gf Lynn took me here for my birthday lunch recently and I fell in love. Yes, the sushi conveyor belt thing is a cute, fun novelty, but the sushi is actually outstanding! The portions are priced just right so you are able to try everything that you are afraid to waste your money on TRYING at the regular sushi joints! I loved this place so much that I immediately brought my bf to try. I would recommend going right at 11am when they open to ensure fresh pickins. I especially enjoyed the seaweed salad, squid salad, and the firecracker appetizer."}
{"text":"ok so I read the bad reviews on here but I still wanted to give this place a try since it's a new place for revloving sushi. Also, I wanted to compare and see if it was better than Teharu Sushi in Tempe.   Well I was not impressed at all...They really need more variety of sushi rolls! The whole time I was there I was just waiting and hoping to see if different rolls would be coming my way but NOPE it was the same california roll, salmon roll or vegas roll just rotating in circles! I don't want to be eating the same rolls over and over! So because of this...my friends and I ordered sushi off the menu. Each roll it took them more than 30-40 mins to make! And this place wasn't even packed! There were total of 3 sushi chefs in the kitchen making sushi too...ugh...I think I was at the restaurant for a good 2 and half hours...  The sushi itself was nothing special. I only liked one of their roll and I only saw that type of roll rotate around once...  Honestly I would not go back here ever again....If you want the whole \"revolving sushi\" experience go to Teharu Sushi... just sayin...."}
{"text":"So I came here around 12:39 pm during my lunch. When I came by, it looks like they were still opening even though the opening time is 10:00 am? I waited inside and was seated. Around 12:59 pm finally I was waited. When the waiters were coming in late into the door. The revolving stand was going around but nothing only of octopus salad. I wasted half of my lunch time here. If you want business be on time and be prepared. Also they play hard music which not a great playlist to play during when elders or older customers come in. Service is slow.   Maybe there just made for late owls...but not for early noon or lunch type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Good choice if you are starved for sushi.  My kids loved the instant gratification.   Service was very good - we visited on Mother's day after a trip from Sedona and they had a flower for my wife.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"Round 2.  Had a bit of birthday gift money to spend and I have dealt with a bit of a headache today so I figured I'd pamper myself.  Seksun has a very comfortable and nice decor these days.    Good food, good staff. (Note:  This review was from October, but forgot to complete it.)"}
{"text":"Very good quality!  Friendly staff.  Really good dining experience.  I was depressed not having go-round places after moving from Portland, OR where there are more go-round places than McDonalds.  Great price for the food!  I would definitely come back!   I had some unique rolls that I have never seen at go-round type places.  The young lady who was waiting my table was very pleasant and never let me drink go dry..."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Fiance wanted sushi and I found this place on Yelp and thought it would be worth it to try out.  Really glad that we did.  We walked in at around noon on Sunday and the place had a few tables full.  Server sat us right by the kitchen and immediately we began grabbing yummy sushi off the rotation. They had favorites and new flavors I had not tasted before.  All of it was fresh and yummy.  Even the kiddo liked it.  Loved that there was also jello on the rotation so she could get some desert.  We will definitely be returning, this was a fun and delicious experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving sushi so ordered some rolls to go.  We went with the usual spicy tuna and california and decided to try the wild tiger specialty roll.  WOW, two days later we were in again getting the wild tiger, lava and red dragon rolls.  They were all excellent!! We are somewhat new to sushi but we are hooked on the tiger rolls at Seksun."}
{"text":"Come here twice and once they've only had one belt running so they had to turn us away. This time their credit card system was down. Not coming back to try a third time."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. My visit to Seksun was only my second foray into the world of Sushi and it was great! I ordered the Las Vegas roll and it was excellent!  The seaweed salad was pretty tasty as well!"}
{"text":"Having tried Teharu and Ahi Revolving Sushi restaurants, we were excited for another fast, inexpensive, and SAFE sushi option. Seksun was really good! They're unlike the other two revolving sushi restaurants in that they have an extensive menu and they are more than happy to take your custom order for rolls, rather than just wait for the roll you want to be put on the conveyor belt.   Their specialty rolls are the best I have had, especially the \"Japanese Pizza\" roll, which has a layer of rice between two sheets of seaweed, lightly fried to a crisp, and then topped with a mix of yummy ingredients. The \"Candle Light\" is so yummy: fluffy crab mix on top of a roll with ahi tuna. Both of these rolls are only $3!!! That being said, the rolls at Teharu and Ahi Revolving Sushi are only $2 on average, so we were surprised we spent $50 at Seksun- 13 plates (3 pieces each) at $3 added up quickly for four people. ***Do NOT get the hot green tea, unless you are willing to pay $1.50 for a mug of hot water and a tea bag. They have a full bar; there's no reason to not have house made hot green tea. Also, we were there at lunch time on a Saturday, and it was nearly empty, which was a little disconcerting. However, the sushi was fresh and really good!"}
{"text":"Went in tonight to get some sushi and Malaysia dishes. Took my spouse and 2 teenage kids for a nice Sunday dinner. They did not disappoint, food was great. Got to talk to the chef and have him cook up a special order of fried hokkien noodles for my wife. Good experience and the service was spot on. Will be back for sure. Keep it up, Seksun!"}
{"text":"I ordered the large wonton soup.  Broth was good BUT the wontons and filling tasted like doughy/flour uncooked nastiness."}
{"text":"Seksun Sushi--their tag line should be: the most depressing sushi bar in town.  Stopped here on a whim (I should refrain from listening to my whims from now on). 5:30 on a Friday night and the place is practically empty; a couple in one booth and a single woman in another, and me. Place is decorated ok. Music leaves a lot to be desired, and the waitress/hostess would have been more excited having her wisdom teeth yanked out. Greeting was lukewarm at best. No smile..Didnt feel welcome... AT ALL.  Portions are tiny for the price. There are better quality and value conveyor belt sushi places out there. Sushi Station in N. Phoenix blows this place out of the water. I didn't feel the sushi itself was all that great and selection was limited. It's not a good sign when the best thing I tasted was a lonely piece of cheesecake... And they don't even make it!  This place doesn't have much going for it, IMHO. I didn't find the staff welcoming, the food was subpar and the atmosphere was, like I said, depressing. I predict that it will go under within the next few years. Not good at all..."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi-go-round!!! Plates are decently priced and service is great. Ambience is good. You can find all the usual sushi suspects here! I'm A Las Vegas roll type of guy, and they have a few rolls completely tempura fried. Absolutely delicious! Mochi ice cream is pretty good dessert to finish. Sushi tastes fresh too! Only reason why I didn't give 5 stars, could have just a bit more variety in rolls. Saw the same 8 - 10 rolls and hoped when one was finished, they'd replace it with a different roll; but, the DJ kept spinning the same sushi record. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out tonight, since I just moved in the neighborhood, I'm still sampling out the local fare. I know this place got some unfavorable reviews in the past by other Yelpers, but honestly, I didn't think it was that bad for what it is. It's a casual dining experience. Since I'm on a budget these days, I can't afford the high end sushi places that exist around town. This eatery is definitely do-able for an after work place for me, and it's very close to home.  Maybe it's not super-duper fancy,  but It is brand new and  very clean.        Although they are still waiting for their liquor license to clear, it's not the end of the world, We all know you can't really have a great sushi experience without a nice cold Kirin or Sopporo and sake. But they should have theirs by August.   They have a bar and TV's already to go for when that happens. I talked to a manager and she told me it is owned by the same owners of China King, which is my new favorite Chinese restaurant. I will definitely be checking back to see how they do. If the China King people own it, I'm sure it will only get better, because CK is absolutely amazing.  This place, and others like it, is kind of like a sushi express, when you need a quick bite that's not too expensive. The portions are smaller than normal places, but so are the prices. It's proportional.  You have plates that are $1, $1.50, $2, $2.50, and $3. Plus if you want something that's not on the go-round, they'll make it for you. The food was good and fresh. The staff was attentive and friendly. When you're talking sushi go rounds, I don't think they were meant to be palaces. Just clean, convenient and inexpensive, and not fast food like.       I think it might be helpful, if you are a Yelper doing reviews, and you don't like a place, to maybe talk to your server or manager and ask some questions about it. Then, if you experience rudeness or indifference, then by all means an unfavorable review is in order.  If not, then maybe (and this is important) provide some feedback! then give them another chance down the road to see if things improve. Believe it or not, they will listen to you. They do see these reviews and are certainly affected by them. This place has only been open a week, so they have a lot of tweaking to do, and they are quite aware of that."}
{"text":"For sushi go-rounds, this place was meh.  I don't know if it was the time of day (Sunday lunch at 1PM) or what...there was very little variety on the conveyer belt - I was there and within the first 3 minutes I had seen everything there was to offer and NOTHING else new came around.  So this forced us to order off of the menu and what a confusing menu it was!  There are nice visual depictions of about 8-9 rolls, but, if you don't see something you want there, then you are forced to order rolls off of the nigiri menu - and I have never seen rolls on a nigiri menu - usually rolls are in their own section in the menu - you get 8 pieces and you just order...the entire roll.  So very odd to have to order 2 pieces of a roll off the nigiri menu (which we didn't do).  Competitors have this conveyer format figured out much better than this establishment - I would go to Teharu over this place in a heartbeat.  Lastly, almost every roll we ordered relied HEAVILY on crab mix.  Every roll had crab mix in it - believe me - I like \"crab\" mix, but there are many more rolls that exist in the world that don't use this ingredient as a crutch."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Everyone is friendly it's not expensive and the food is fresh and delicious. My sister in law took me to Teharu and I hated it, I'll never go anywhere else but here  And now they have military discount  Woo Hoo  thank you for appreciating all military personnel!!"}
{"text":"Tonight the cooked sushi was cold and it took calling them by phone from our table to get drink refills.  We will definitely be rethinking whether or not we make the drive from Apache Junction to here ever again after this level of service.  Wow tonight stunk."}
{"text":"I give this 4 stars because of the freshness of the sushi. I've been here 4 times in the past week and a half and the fish was fresh and the chef is always putting out plates in the goround. The decor is pleasant and modern, but they need to turn the music up on either the tvs or the music. But this is made up by the prices! Cheaaaap! it's great for a sushi craving and it does satisfy!"}
{"text":"The sushi is not that great here but they usually have some kind of deals on drinks b/c that is the reason my boyfriends twin goes here besides the fact that they are close to our condo.  But in my opinion i do not care for arrogant people that manage a business that have to flaunt it non stop like they literally own the place.  That kind of attitude really drives me away. The only reason i like coming is b/c my boyfriend likes to spend time with his friends obviously and the drink deals they get with the manager that says he \"practically owns it\""}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when I was out and needed a quick lunch in between appointments. I was sat promptly and the rotating sushi suffice my cravings while I waited for the roll I ordered. The place was not super packed and the food was freshly made."}
{"text":"It is a great place to stay by. The food on conveyor sushi belt was surprisingly fresh. The waitress and the boss was very nice. The wild tiger, flash star, bubble gum and the appetizers was amazing!! Will come back again"}
{"text":"Know this place is really focused on sushi belt but I went for the off menu stuff. Ordered Indonesian Fried Noodles and Chow Kway Teow. Right off the bat I wasn't too thrilled with the service as they were slow...really slow (greater than 20 minutes). The food that came was piping hot which was a plus and the Dragon's Breath taste was there. The problem with the food was that it was a bit too salty and definitely oily. The portion size was decent as well given the pricing.   I am pretty positive that they use MSG in the dishes as I was SUPER thirsty after the meal.   Probably won't be coming back as I can get better of both elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. I loved the fact that they delivered and offered carry out. The sushi was fresh and the presentation was neat. Delivery was very fast and the delivery guy was great. Affordable prices. I will go back and I do recommend them."}
{"text":"Oh god why did I come here... The selection here is very limited to California rolls with different toppings. Most of my dinner consisted of mayo imitation krab meat, blehkkkk! I tried getting some raw fish rolls off the menu, such as the cherry blossom or salmon lover.. What a regret. It did not taste fresh whatsoever! I feel like they refrigerated it previously. They basically are very cheap on the fish, and then they load the rest with imitation krab meat -__-"}
{"text":"First impressions: Came in famished, and ready to eat small children  so I was happy to see it was a turnstile sushi place and I can get right to eating. It's beautifully designed. I love the large mural on the wall, the large lanterns and how the seating is arranged.  The food was good . My waitress left something to be desired. She was not engaging. Since she didn't give her name and barely came around all I can tell you is I'm here on Sunday @ 1:30pm and she is a white girl with brownish blonde hair. I'm hoping it's just a bad day for her. The manager is friendly and came out to talk to the regulars. I'm still like the atmosphere. Happy hour from 4pm - 7pm aaaannnd there's a hookah lounge next . Gotta love  that!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and it's amazing. Cat was my server and she was super sweet, awesome and attentive!! Sushi is great and also had crab puffs, those were delicious. They have happy hour so I will definitely be back another time to take advantage of their specials. The restaurant was clean and I didn't have to wait long to be seated. Would definitely recommend them to friends or anyone looking to try a new sushi place."}
{"text":"Stuck to the conveyor belt since that's the primary focus and loved it.  I put the sushi as better than sushi 101 but less than kabuki. It was very cozy and we enjoyed the vibe.  Definitely like the cream puff dessert, edamame, and I think what was the crunchy California roll the best.  I had the plates of those. Very fairly priced for the quality! Also if you can,  try the peach sake!"}
{"text":"First time visitor today with my hubby and picky kiddo. We loved being able to view and pick our sushi instantly. So many times we eat eel and its a miss, but here, we got multiple plates. Such friendly smiles here as well. We may make this our next regular spot! Lots of cooked sushi options for those who can't stomach the raw (or are Preggo). We loved it!!"}
{"text":"Truthfully, I've never been to a Sushi Restaurant with a conveyor belt before. I was looking forward to the experience.  I'd give this place 2-3 stars for being ok.  I have to say, that the food isn't terrible. The flavor is ok, nothing overly flavored or no flavored at all. The food isn't memorable. The freshness, as with many Phoenix Sushi joints, is questionable. There are just too many sushi places and the turnover rate isn't fast enough in general. Smaller towns like Tucson have faster turnover rates. The fish is not flown in every morning and I'd like to check out the refrigeration temperature if I could. I'm not sure, but I had a light cramp, even though I had only ordered their freshest fish.  This place had great service. The waitress was polite and helpful. She was also courteous but not in a subservient way. Good for her. One of the stars above is for her excellent service. We went in for lunch for an hour, and we were the only ones there.  The atmosphere was quiet and trendy. Pops of color, clean tables and clean colored plates.   Overall, I'd go here only if I were hungry and I just happened to be passing by. I'd also only order the cooked ingredients during the lunch hour.  I had: -Seaweed Salad -Squid Salad -California Roll (3 pieces) -Spicy California Roll (3 pieces) -Sweet Egg(Tomago) Sushi (2 pieces) [friend had it, I didn't, i really likes it) -Salmon (Raw)  -Tuna Roll (3 pieces) -Dragon Roll (3 pieces) -Rainbow Roll (3 pieces) -Crunch Rock & Roll (3 pieces) -Eel Avocado Roll -2-3 other plates (can't remember :) ) -Ice water Total: $30 for 2 people"}
{"text":"This place has a sushi conveyor belt, so I got to watch several varieties slide past. Mostly I saw sushi rolls, and also several types of dessert - and jello!  But today we ordered from the menu instead. Three of us each ordered a dish, then shared family style. My friends know the cook so he made some special Malaysian dishes for us!   First was the Sambal Seafood. It was tasty, with lots of prawns, mussels, and maybe squid. They served homemade Sambal on the side, which was great! It had a distinct balanchan flavor, which I liked but some may not. For my friends, the balanchan could have been stronger.   The Hokkien Fried Noodle was also very good. I spiced it up with some chili paste with garlic, which probably was made with Sambal Olek.  Last, the Hainanese Chicken Rice was just ok. Instead of being infused with chicken broth, the rice seemed like regular white rice.  This was my first time here, and it's definitely a repeater! Next time I'll try the Fried Kway Teow."}
{"text":"Saw a ton of cars in the parking lot but walked in no one was in the place. Took them 5 minutes to get our drink order. I was nervous for revolving because of the temperature of the food. Luckily the first item seaweed salad was cold. I got the Las Vegas roll which was more batter and rice than anything else. Came during happy hour most of the rolls they offered were a dollar less and lots of rice. The items on the conveyor belt were limited and they ran out of tamago. It was very bland and wasn't impressed"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place ever. I take friends here, go on dates here, spend time with my family. Their happy hour is to die for and I love the little converbelt. Everyone I've taken here absolutely falls in love and you will to."}
{"text":"My experience is just like the Yelp commentary above \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"   This sushi wasn't bad tasting, but it wasn't great. I think there are plenty of better sushi joints in the Chandler, Temple area. Also, the prices are not much better than regular sushi prices, especially considering how little food is presented on the plate.  Maybe after a little while they will get it together. There was not much offered on the conveyor belt but it was after the lunch rush. The wait to get more food was ridiculous.   It just wasn't that great. There is a much better sushi place in Tempe."}
{"text":"Good sushi at great price - my favorite was the Honda Roll. Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Came in 15 minutes before close on a Friday night and they refused to let me sit down even though I knew exactly what I wanted to order. The owners were in the middle of a family dinner and the blonde hostess was unbelievable rude. I got my sushi with 8 minutes till close, glad I got it to go so I didn't have to given a tip to any of this staff.  Sushi is good but service is trash"}
{"text":"Much like the other conveyor belt sushi restaurant Teharu, Seksun offers various rolls at rock bottom prices (If you know what to get). Prices range from $1 (Typically very basic California-style rolls) to $3 on the belt, although they do have a full menu that you can order other rolls and items from. The menu items are also fairly reasonable as well ($1 miso soup, $3 vegetable tempura). The items on the belt when we went were either rolls (3 pieces per plate) or some type of salad (Seaweed, octopus, or squid).  It was pretty dead when we went here on a weekend night to have dinner, with one or two other tables of people eating here. Most of the rolls on the belt were the most expensive $3 kind, with a few scattered $1 plates. The quality was OK, nothing too special, you basically get what you pay for. The rice in some of the rolls was a little mushy, but the flavors were decent.   We did end up ordering some miso soup and vegetable tempura from the menu. The miso was alright, and the vegetable tempura consisted of slices of sweet potato, zucchini, white potato, and onion.   Service was decent, and very friendly. Drinks were refilled as needed.  They are very eager to please here, and I'd say service is better and friendlier than the service at Teharu. Overall, a good alternative to the other conveyor belt sushi places if you are in this area of Chandler."}
{"text":"Very good service, they were incredibly friendly. Great sushi for the price. Love that they will make to order any roll on their menu in addition to the belt, gives you the opportunity to try anything on the menu without committing to a whole roll. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Awful. We stopped with all the best expectations- first they were out of ginger, then they gave my sashimi to some one at  at the bar, tried to serve us tea warmed up in  a microwave and then came back to explain they could make hot water. They got the sushi order completely screwed up. Never again. Had to go to Whole Foods to finish dinner."}
{"text":"The concept was very cool and I loved the casual feel, there were just a few things that made me unwilling to eat this food. The cleanliness of the place was okay, but the chairs were disgusting. They are made of old orange heavy cotton that has stained and gotten dirty over time. They were quite grody and led me to be suspicious of other things I was seeing.  Second, the items on the sushi conveyor seemed to have been there awhile. I could see into the back and, sitting on the counter in the 70* air, were the refills for what got taken from the go-round. My family used to work with food and I know that having food sit out for that long is a recipe for bacteria. I didn't eat the food, but my boyfriend did. He does have an upset stomach and went to bed early. Said all of the sushi tasted decent (better than Fry's) but the octopus salad had tasted far off. He guarantees that is what did him in, so buyer beware on that choice."}
{"text":"Sushi is great.  Portions are small.  Price isn't too bad.  Good service.  Good setup.  Doesn't feel like their trying to squeeze as many tables in a small area."}
{"text":"Oh Seksun, I'm sorry I have to lower my rating. You were an entertaining place when I first found you and I think I was intrigued by the roundabout fun that you supplied but now I just want good sushi and for the most part you don't deliver like other sushi places.  Typically if you come here during a non-busy time cold sushi's are warm from being out and fried warm sushi tend to be cool for the same reason. If you're going to come here come on a Friday or Saturday night around 7 when they're really busy. It means having freshly made sushi moving around the belt. I love the idea of picking and trying different kinds instead of getting rolls from other places, but the other places are fresher. I might still come here every now and then but I think Seksun needs to step up their game. Theyre still pretty decent just not 5 star worthy."}
{"text":"Sushi is great, price is better.  This is a great place to try new sushi options at a great price with a lot of selection !   Service was great and the place was clean!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! THEY HAVE ROACHES!!!!!! I who's there was a negative star, as it will not let me post without selecting one."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. I expected much more. Service was good but that is about it. I thought that sushi quality was not there. I've been to revolving sushi restaurant in the past and their food was fresher. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with the food or service here. I dont think i have ever said that before. This place is solid and prices are good and food is good. Only complaint when the restaurant is slow the fried rolls get cold on the go round. So when we get there I check the fried rolls and if they are cold then we just order what we want from the menu. Very nice accomadating employees."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick and relatively cheap fix for your sushi craving this is definitely a good spot to try if you're in the area. Seksun is a revolving style sushi bar with plates ranging from $1 to $3. If that's not your style there is also the option of ordering directly from the menu.   We were seated at the very end of the conveyor belt which turned out to be a rather inconvenient spot. Several families came in after us and were seated at the beginning of the belt which gave them the opportunity to grab plates first as they came out.   You're not going to be blown away by the quality but the sushi seemed fresh enough and most the items I had were quite tasty. I had six plates for under $20 and left feeling full."}
{"text":"I always have loved going to this place, the only thing that has bothered me was the last time i went our waiter never came by our table.. the only time on his own was to get our order and that was it.. i had to get the attention of a waitress to ask if she could get him for us. He never brought us our bill and we waited a good 15 minutes after we we were done too. I kept glancing at him every time he looked our way but he never came over and eventually i got up and asked if we could have our bill."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite spots for lunch and dinner. The Firecrackers are amazing, my kids love the orange chicken, and the sushi is always yummy! They have some awesome happy hour deals too."}
{"text":"Great sushi at a very reasonable price. Service is ok, not great. But sushi takes care of that. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"this place was ok. nothing exceptional and nothing horrible.  the atmosphere was good and clean.  the staff was nice.  however, my friend and i did go at 1pm on a friday and it was empty, meaning there was not much of a turn over on the revolving belt... they make it clear that they were willing to make and prepare anything for us that we wanted and didnt see.    the sushi was ok. i could taste a difference in temp with some pieces of sushi-- one that they just put out that was cold.. and one that was on the belt for a while and not so cold.. thankfully, no tummy aches from that!  pricing is ok.  the cheapest sushi for a dollar is california rolls... which to me isnt really sushi. so my plates were from $2 to $2.50 each.   id be willing to go back again for a light meal.. but i feel like for the price, i should go to an all you can eat place if im going to eat a lot of sushi.."}
{"text":"one of the BEST sushi places I have been to! you can order sushi as well as take plates from the revolving sushi bar. wild tiger and red dragon is the best!! very friendly staff, they checked up on us at least every 10 minutes asking if everything was good and okay.   overall, definately will be coming back and recommending this restaruant to friends!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, while the place is clean and the staff are nice the offering on the Sushi Goround is dismal. This place is not a top 5 sushi bar, we go here for quick sushi on the go but there is nothing worth eating on the Goround. Nice concept, cheap execution!!"}
{"text":"Ok so the first time we came in this place they were closing. But decided to not tell us, we were the only two in the restaurant and the sushi was obviously end of day sushi.  However, we decided they deserved a second chance. Today was the day; my friend and I went in at 1pm. Once again we were the only people in the restaurant.  The server seemed shocked to have customers, and didn't understand why we were entering? There are about eight TVs. All were on. All were muted. The sushi was from who knows when.  You could hear a pin drop, again.  When two other customers finally showed up after we requested the tab, we tried making eye contact to warn them - no.. just go. It's not worth it.  Finally as we were leaving the server turned on some music.  We decided that it must be a four patron minimum for any ambiance to be initiated.  You can get the same quality sushi at Fry's in the deli than in this place.  We wanted to love it. We gave a a second chance. It got an F again."}
{"text":"It was the last day of Arizona Restaurant Week and so naturally the wife was craving cheap sushi instead of something novel and adventurous. Sometimes I think she has a mercury deficit.  Anyways, as far as cheap sushi goes, this is top-notch. The people working must have been the owners. Both moved frenetically the whole time we were there from table to table, cleaning, serving, nodding profusely, apologizing, etc. The stereotypes are replete. This may as well be \"City Sushi\" from South Park with Trey Parker providing the accents. Granted, this atmosphere probably doesn't stack up well compared with the 360 degree rotating scenic mountain view in the gilded balcony of a Persian palace we could have had for $30 per plate during Arizona Restaurant Week, but I digress.  Rolls taste great, and that's what is really important. The specialty rolls are $3/plate with 3 pieces/plate. Less desirable rolls are $2/plate, and the blobs of Jello nobody wants perpetually roll around the conveyor at a dollar per plate. Everything except that jello was fresh and tasty, and I didn't try the jello, so it might have been too. Except that it's a blob of jello, so it's probably been there since they opened. All in all, no bites were regretted, even though we could have been eating rotmos med fläsk off the bellies of Swedish virgins for only $30/plate.  Overall, this is not a great anniversary dinner, but for addicts will serve nicely. If you know what you want and you just want it cheap, this is the place. It's no tenderloin caprese, medium-rare steak, chocolate mousse and raspberry three course meal for $30/plate, but if you need a cheap fix you'll get it."}
{"text":"Finally Tried this place... Glad we did....   This place had some very good Sushi, comparable to our spot in San Diego...   We had,  Lava Roll, Las Vegas Roll, Cherry Blossom, Bubba Gump Shrimp roll, and Wife ordered the Yakisoba.. FOOD was very good and GREAT price ,,   Chris and Staff were VERY Hospitable... Will def be back.."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for a surprise birthday with her friends.  I chalked up big points.  The staff was extremely helpful and nice.  They set up a great place for us to sit.  They were really nice to the kids as well.  Their food was a hit too. Everyone really enjoyed their sushi and kids loved their Ramen. On top of all that their prices  are affordable. What a fantastic restaurant! The people who work there who are smiling the whole time!  Nice hometown feel.  I am sure they will learn to recognize us by name.  This is our new sushi place!"}
{"text":"Nope. No thank you. I love sushi, and I love the conveyor belt trend (Teharu is probably one of my favorite places ever) but I am not impressed with this place.  I was not impressed with the quality. I did not think it was as fresh as it could be, and that was me watching the chef put new plates out so I did not take the chance on picking up something that had been sitting out on the belt for a while. I even ordered something that was not on rotation so I know it was just made, and the quality was not there.  The selection was highly disappointing. Granted, I went on a weeknight but I'm going to say that 75% of the dishes included cream cheese. Now I have a personal affliction with cream cheese in my sushi, but that aside I'm sorry, that many dishes should not have cream cheese! It is an abomination and makes me Hulk angry.   Oh and the tap water was gross. Granted most tap water is gross and I am very aware of that when I order it, I also ordered a green iced tea that refused to taste like tea and just bore the resemblance on the tap water. Nope, no thank you.  Cream cheese rant aside, I will not be coming back, and will be slightly salty towards the whole establishment when I drive by, every day."}
{"text":"First time I went here, it was great! Service was great! When we went back, we had a completely different experience.  I want to say the owner/manager served us the first time and she was really nice. When we went back, I just saw high school kids working the front. So the entire time we could hear them gossiping at the front. I ordered masago, the tiny fish eggs. I like enjoy them with my sushi as a topping. Well, I was brought the large salmon roe fish. When I mentioned it to the server, she went in the back and came back saying the chef said it was the same thing. I explained no it wasn't. The larger eggs are fishy and not the texture I enjoy. But she insisted the chef said they were the same thing. I even had to google it and show her that it was wrong. Still never got the masago and was charged for the wrong eggs that went uneaten. I just wanted what I ordered! I would have paid for it. Ugh.  The rolls they offer on the rotation were warm/room temp. Sushi should never be warm or room temp. So I was afraid to eat any of it.  Sad to say. I won't be back. Just needs some major improvements."}
{"text":"LOVE this Place!!!!! Love the belt that goes around with the sushi and you just take whichever rolls you want and small portions with cheap prices so you can try more instead of just one roll. Never seen anything like it! Very friendly staff too! Go here all the time for happy hour!! Sushi always fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice, small sushi bar with revolving selections. Limited variety on what is in the revolving section, but all tasty types of rolls. Good happy hour specials, although their tuna tataki is moreso smoked than seared. Friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"I really like this place at first but after last night I have to lower my rating. The sushi was okay until after I was eating an edamame there was a tiny roach bouncing around on my table and it bounced on my edamame.. Omg I wanted to throw up and didnt have an apetite after I saw that. I dont think I will be back here. You guys should take care of this as soon as possible. People dont want roaches on their food."}
{"text":"I thought about giving this review a lesser rating because yes, there is better (read: expensive sushi) but honestly I wouldn't change a thing- we had a blast. And for rotating sushi this is top notch!   A gf and I stopped in for dinner last night and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We sat at a table right by the kitchen and were excited by the amount and selection of fresh choices that came out- rotating sushi is fun and they certainly were constantly updating and putting out new plates to ensure a fresh and tasty experience! Loved the fire dragon roll- ended up with 2 of those, edamame, golden dragon, and I orders the salmon love off the menu. It was all really tasty and fresh and our sake bombers to wash it down were a happy hour deal so we made out. We will be back- this place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"1 star is way too much for this establishment. Placed an order online. Was shorted a roll, was told I was delivered chicken nuggets for my 3 yr old when in fact it was calamari. Instead correcting the situation they argued. Spent $50 on soup gyoza and a roll. Food that was delivered was disgusting. Will never return..."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had actually worked here a half a year ago and had suggested we try it.  I'm glad we did!  At 5PM, the place was half-full of merry patrons doing sake bombers and guzzling Happy Hour $5 large beers.  The conveyor belt was constantly full and the fish was fresh.  The portions are pretty decent as well [unlike Teharu which has been lacking in size and quality].  Price-wise is pretty comparable to Teharu and you're definitely getting more bang for your buck.  While the selection wasn't too plentiful on the conveyor belt itself, you can order whatever you want off the menu.  While it's not exactly Las Vegas or San Francisco quality, I'd definitely come back.  The two of us had a bill of $43.  Not bad... I can definitely justify taking advantage of that semi-annual sale at Express!  :)   Note:  The hours listed on Yelp is wrong.  They no longer have the two-hour break in the middle of the day.  Happy Hour falls around this time so don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Great signs in a revolving sushi establishment - clean and neat environment, lids properly placed on the plates, multiple occupied tables around the track. Seksun has all three! For lunch the variety was good, but I'm intrigued to find out what other options there are for dinner.   With only 1 server and 1 chef during lunch time, service was a bit slow, but they were both productively running around and doing their best to keep up with all tables. The track was never completely empty and fresh options were on there every time it came around.  All in all, definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"First let me say the restaurant problems come from management, not the wait staff.  After visiting 4 times on separate occasions I am throwing in the towel on this fine establishment. Poor food preparation,dirty seat benches,inattentive chef,and not so fresh sashimi on the most recent visit Sunday. They were NOT busy at all and it took 15 minutes to get 1 order of salmon sashimi... The taste was borderline stale. Avoid this place until they get new owner or management. Prices are fair to middle ground, but the food needs help..in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on a drive home one night had to try it.  The place was clean and staff was friendly.   Rolls were great and fresh my favorite is the bubba gump.  Seem to have a good flow of rolls on the belts however lacking options, but you can order anything of the menu.  The apple sake was great too.    I have been back a few time since my first visit and been a happy customer every time."}
