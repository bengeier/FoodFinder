{"text":"This is easily some of the best breakfast food I've ever had. It reminds me of a homemade and much better panera bread. And I really like panera.   The smell when you walk in is so good that it instantly lifts your spirits and puts a smile on your face. I think I was smiling the entire time I was in the restaurant. I ordered the endless French toast and couldn't be happier. I  just moved here from Michigan and I will be back at Neaders very very soon.   Excellent friendly staff too!!"}
{"text":"I have been here three separate times since the opening less than two weeks ago, specifically for two different loaves of bread that had been recommended by friends, and I was excited to try each.   Every time the service is extremely slow, but I understand the process is a little slower for better quality food from scratch. I've been satisfied with the food itself but each time I have been, the customer service has progressively been worse.   Today was the breaking point and I have already contacted management. I went through the drive through today for the first time and someone named Vesta (even though my receipt says Kaydon, so I am assuming she lied to me?) was absolutely horrible. I got to the window and started to ask what the loyalty card was that I had been given my previous trip (no one ever explained it to me). She rolled her eyes and stuck up her pointer finger without saying a word apparently to shush me? Then took my cards out of my hand and closed the window without a word. I was frustrated by this but held my tongue. When she gave me back my cards I started to ask again, and AGAIN she simply closed the window without even an acknowledgement that I had spoken.   When she finally brought out my food almost a full 5 minutes later, I was fed up and told her that I had tried to ask her a question twice and I don't appreciate being ignored. I asked her what her name was and she hesitated, then told me it was \"Vesta\". I told her I would be contacting her manager and she laughed, said \"thanks\" sarcastically, and proceeded to close the window and refused to open it again.   Long story short, the food is pretty good when they haven't run out of certain breads half way through the day, BUT the service is horrible. \"Vesta\", you need to learn that your customers are your most valuable asset. Without them you wouldn't be working. So try a littler harder next time, because you never know who the next person may be that you mistreat!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location to eat at. It's all fresh, the staff is amazing and goes above and beyond for you. Everything from the bread bowl to the cookies are homemade deliciousness. We're addicted!"}
{"text":"Had my first meal at Kneaders today. The food was good and the employees seemed to enjoy serving their clients. It has a nice wholesome vibe. I'll be  back to try more of their extensive menu."}
{"text":"So, yeah....I actually got food poisoning the last time I ate here.  It's probably my fault, having grabbed a late lunch, ordering soup and sandwich around 3:30pm, which I'm guessing meant the food stayed out quite a while after the lunch rush.  But, um, that'll do it for me!  So if you do go here, go when it's busy. I guess."}
{"text":"Tried kneader since thye just opened next to my hoise. The dessert they all taste the same. Bread was not fresh. The one star goes for the coffee."}
{"text":"3 of us went to Kneaders for breakfast.  All 3 of our meals were terrible.  Omelets were dry and french toast was soggy.  Purchased a cinnamon roll to go based on the appearance of the online menu.  Was absolutely nothing like on the menu.  Out of ice too! Would never go back! Horrible!"}
{"text":"If you can get past waiting in a long line, the food is worth it! They have many different delicious desserts, and their sandwiches as quite good as well! This is a place you should try at least once!"}
{"text":"I've been going to kneaders long before they ever opened one here in mesa so when they opened one up near me was exciting. I've only gone through the drive thru the few times I've gone but the line has never been very long if there is a line at all. (Maybe I've gone at the off peak times around lunch) but they have always been very quick to make my order. I've gotten the turkey, bacon,  avocado on foccacia and the turkey, bacon, avocado salad and they are both delicious. My son loves the double fudge brownie and always asks for me to get him one. I also usually get the grilled cheese sandwich for my kids to share and that's delicious as well. I will keep coming back for years to come."}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey sandwich and chicken noodle soup here, probably the best sandwich I've had in years. Doesn't hurt that the service is superb here too!"}
{"text":"The lunch selection is great, soups, salads, sandwiches...all amazing. They generally have the same soups but not all in one day so it is a hit and miss for the soup selection. As far as pastries go it is pretty basic, but they are good! Just a tip for you Chai fanatics out there, the chai tea/frappe doesn't taste anything like chai. That's my only negative review about the place. Staff is great, and if they make a mistake they'll own up to it and fix it right then and there!"}
{"text":"The BEST kneaders I've even been to!! Such amazing and fresh food!! And the most wonderful customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of women before church. We had dinner and it was our first time here. What great tasting food, big selection, and even better prices than paradise bakery. The service and attitude were marvelous - the manager was nice, fun, and courteous. The little shop was cute! The French Toast was amazing! All u can eat too. Their desserts ( homemade goodies) were succulent - so many to choose from. Love this place. A must."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today and I really liked it! I went through the drive through (which was a little slow) but the sandwich I got (the chicken, cheese, and turkey) was totally worth the wait! I'll be back to try their breads and pastries!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but overpriced. Desserts are decadent and have not been stale when I've purchased them. Service is terrible. Lines are slow, especially the drive thru, and an employee practically  barked at me when I asked how to get a to go container."}
{"text":"This place is really good and the people were very nice and polite. The coffee was not too strong but was still really good. I love that the bread for the sandwiches is baked fresh that morning. It is a great place to have breakfast. They have cookies, pies, cakes and loaves of bread to buy. I also like that they have small knickknacks to buy."}
{"text":"Here's a real review. I'm not a franchisee, family member, employee, or paid reviewer who pumps up new places with padded reviews.  I have been to this location 4 times. I have sampled the menu during breakfast, lunch, and evening.  One word, terrible.  Not terrible in the fast food sense of the word but terrible none the less. This restaurant struggles with simple items like chicken salad sandwiches, paninis, and salads. Coffee is on par with fast food or gas stations.  89052 needed a gas station not another sub par restaurant that will be shuttered in 6 months or less. Perhaps when they close we'll get a gas station. The bright side? The food quality won't change."}
{"text":"This is a perfect place for friends to meet and eat with pleasure. Staff is friendly and helpful. Sandwiches, soups, salads, desserts, bread - even coffee - is excellent. A very good place for all ages. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Breakfast French toast and pecan pancakes were delicious! Very nice interior and the service was attentive."}
{"text":"I've been to Kneader's twice now and I have to say I am a fan. They have yummy food for a great price and their smoothies are the best! Love it!"}
{"text":"Always friendly fast and delicious a must go for lunch and breakfast .. they have samples at the front register and the place is very clean ."}
{"text":"I stared coming to kneaders when they opened. I loved the atmosphere and the food. Saddly my last three visits I have been very disappointed. My visits were between 4 and 6 pm. They were out of bread bowls, soups, coffee, etc I am reluctant to try again.  PS: customer service should be improve. I would hate to see this lovely store close do to missmanagement."}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich as to my surprise their was a nasty long black hair. Brought it to attention of the staff who refunded the sandwich but still charged me 2.50 for the small soup and drink. The manager never came to Apologize or say one word. Kneaders Bakery FAIL!!!"}
{"text":"This is my families new favorite place to eat. All the items on the menu are delicious.  The breads and pastries are made fresh daily on site. Kneader's is quickly surpassing the other bagel shops on this side of town."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here last time.  Thought they deserved one more try.   NEVER again.  I ordered for pick up.  When I got home and opened my French Dip.  Bread was a little burnt on the bottom.  Roast Beef was burnt and crusty around all the edges and OMG  the au jus, I had to dump 3/4 out and dilute the rest with hot water.  It was like mud and tasted like a whole salt shaker had been dumped in it.   Was able to pick out enough meat and cheese to eat at least 1/2 of it.   I'm  done with Kneaders."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, I enjoyed the oldies music they had playing, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis. I went around 12:30 so it was pretty packed. I had the French Dip on Baguette. The meat to bread ratio was terrible, there should have been at least twice the meat for the size of the bread. The baguette was pretty dry and dense, I like mine a little lighter. The Au Jus was just OK, no different then you would get at Arby's. Speaking of Arby's, it's just down the street and their French Dip and Swiss is much better. I may go back and try something else, but that sandwich was the worst French Dip I've ever had."}
{"text":"Have used the drive-thru several times to buy the good quality, cheap coffee but today decided to try the food.  The place is clean and the staff was very friendly. It took a little longer than expected to get our food considering there wasn't a huge crowd. The Panini's come with a pickle on the side and Parmesan potato chips ... All ingredients looked very fresh and displayed beautifully. Will definitely try this location again."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!!  Better than Panera Bread.  Highly recommend this place.  Glad to have them in Vegas."}
{"text":"For all the hype this place is just okay. It's not easy to get in/out of that's for certain. The street design & parking lot are the reason for it. Coming up to Anthem easy in; coming down the hill you have to flip a U and it's a hassle. Leaving is total pain.   I ordered the french dip. It was just okay. I have certainly had better. The flavor lingered for days which I wasn't keen on. To be fair I got it To Go and 30 minutes later at work is when I was able to eat. I may try it again there and see if it's better. The bread was good and soft.   It's a very cute shop and I will be back, but probably won't go out of my way to eat here when Panera is across the street."}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian then by all means order the pastrami. If you can find the meat or even taste it you are doing better than I did. Overpriced to be sure. I asked if the pastrami was hot, the cashier said yes but it wasn't. When I took it back the manager asked them to put it on the grill for me. When I got it back, still not hot. Later the manager came over and took our trays and said he was glad we enjoyed our dinner. He didn't ask if we enjoyed our dinner and quite frankly, I didn't. Also the meal cost me twelve dollars, for a sandwich, chips and a drink! I won't go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with their French Dip today.  This is my 3rd visit to Kneaders (all different locations) and the bread was barely chewable, only 1 slice of meat with some melted cheese in the baguette.  So much bread with hardly any meat.  Was so tempted to return it.   Should have, but by the time I finished chewing half of the sandwich I was exhausted!!!  There was only 1 person taking the orders and the line was across the counter where the sweets were, all the way to the door!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best baked goodies from cakes to baked bread as well as coffee. Any sandwich you get is amazing ! Beautiful cozy and relaxing."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see  some bad reviews, then again no one is perfect,  you're bound to have a bad day and people are  always more inclined to talk about a bad  experience than  a good one. And besides it's  a new location so there's going to be some warming up time. ..  So, instead, I would  like  to  share  my awesome experiences with you! I have yet to be disappointed in my food. My personal favorite is the  portobello grille, the flavors are fantastic,  the  sandwich is huge and I always get a meal because I love the soups I've tried.  (Favorite is the mushroom brie, enchilada soup and tomato bisque). The  pastries are fantastic,  never dry. I even ordered rolls for Thanksgiving and  my picky family raved about them, they even got requested for Christmas dinner! The staff was really helpful when  I bought bread for  my friends bridal shower,  she's vegan and they triple checked to make sure what I was  buying was ok for  her.  I used  the  baguettes to make bruschetta and it was wonderful,  total hit at the  party!   If you're looking for a great little soup, sandwich, salad or a sweet treat, definitely give kneaders a try!"}
{"text":"My first and last experience. This chain is more about presentation than about quality ingredients. I had the Club sandwich did not care for any of the cold cuts used. Even the bread I found to be lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed several visits to Kneaders.  Wonderful atmosphere, exciting menu, fabulous desserts, yummy breads, friendly service! This is a great place to meet family and friends to relax and have a nice time.  So happy they're in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Can I get some meat with my bread?? The way this place makes there sandwiches is absurd. This turkey sandwich may as well be a vegetarian sandwich with the lack of turkey.   This place is awesome at making it look like you got a fully packed sandwich, only to find out that it's an illusion.    A sandwich this price should not be all bread and no meat."}
{"text":"Starbucks is in same parking lot and doesn't have half the flavor or menu. Blended drinks are world's better at Kneaders. The staff is a ton nicer as well."}
{"text":"What a nice place to catch up with friends over coffee.  Everything is delicious     Amazing soups  Great Salads   And wonderful sandwiches.  Desserts to die for.   Try the carrot cake    You'll melt.  You've gotta try this place    Don't forget to sign up for your loyalty card.  It adds up quick and its nice to have a free lunch once in awhile."}
{"text":"Saw the manager Scott scream at one of his employees, very unprofessional and it made me feel unsafe in the restaurant. This man needs to be fired for such a childish temper tantrum."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place today because it's near my house and has a drive thru. Needless to say, my husband and I don't plan to return. Im giving it two stars because 1) the staff was nice 2) the bread was tasty. Everything else was subpar though and for the price, you can get a much better quality, value and portion at Corner Bakery or Paradise Bakery. We went through drive thru and my husband ordered the Reuben and I ordered a tuna sandwich. With no sides or drinks, the bill was over $16. The sandwiches took close to ten minutes to get and the Reuben was very thin with only a couple pieces of meat on it. My tuna sandwich consisted only of bread, minimal tuna and lettuce. No tomato was even offered and everything was just dry and haphazardly strewn together. They apologized for making us wait in the drive thru window for so long and must have felt bad because they threw in some random bag of broken up chewy chips which consisted of mostly crumbs. It was all in all an odd and pretty low quality meal. Too bad because it's a great location, but I'll drive further for a much higher quality sandwich somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, lunch, smoothies and or dessert! Friendly wait staff, orders made to order and quickly at that too! Omelets are good portions. French toast is amazing! And if you dine in you can get all you can eat. Great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"Love Kneaders! Their sandwiches are huge and their desserts are really good. If you haven't tried the raspberry bread pudding, it's a must.  This is one if those places like Panera that are great because they're a step above the typical fast food, but more casual and faster than an actual sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and ordered a simple cup of coffee and a smoothie....pretty easy right ? Well not for this place ! We waited FOREVER.  We were the only car in line so it wasn't like they were busy. No apology from the staff for the long wait. The coffee was cold and the smoothie was warm by the time we got it. Definitely wouldn't waste any more money on this place. First and last visit !"}
{"text":"They just opened this place and NOT impressed, went through drive through and ordered bread, they did not have it, attempted to order something else, they did not have that that either, then ordered something they did have along with a pastery, but had to wait awhile, then ended up with wrong pastery, did go back in but just a lot of time wasted!"}
{"text":"Food is wonderful! Staff very friendly. However ever time I have used the restroom.... Soap dispenser is in pieces or there is no toilet paper. Paper towels and tissue all over the floor."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the French Dip sandwich was amazing!!! The bread is so fresh and delicious. The first time the food came out super quick, my second visit today took a little longer but the food was still great. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I went there last night and everyone is so friendly. The pumpkin bread is delicious and your soups are wonderful. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Really? 15 minutes in line to order?  Can you get another cash register going? I finally get to order get my coffee cup and they are out of coffee. I go tell the one cashier who then stops taking orders to go get the coffee. We finally get our cinnamon rolls and milk 15 minutes later. WTH? Hire more people!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a cappuccino, got a semi warm liquid with crumbs/coffee grinds. When I asked what is it, they said their machine cannot steam/foam up milk, so I asked why are they letting people order cappuccinos and asked for a refund.... the whole service was slow and cakes were not that great."}
{"text":"Great for sandwiches and a quick meal.  Staff is friendly.  Prices reasonable. Yummy French toast. Wish they were open on Sunday"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good even though everything is priced way too high. The soups are pretty good but they're not too happy about making exceptions for those of us with allergies. So with that being said I just take my kids so they can enjoy lunch or a pastry and I order a mocha frappe. They're very very tasty."}
{"text":"There cinnamon French toast  is amazing! It's so thick with homemade Carmel syrup! And best part is its unlimited if you dine in for only $6! Great atmosphere for a quick delicious breakfast until 11am."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and had a great experience BUT do NOT go here during he holidays. Half the place is taken up for PRE ORDERED bread for customers waiting for pick up. As in the chairs and booths and tables are taken up by breads and rolls. So where do the CURRENT paying customers there for breakfast sit? You stand. You stand and stare at the booths and tables that are taken up by BREAD. And the establishment is SO CALLOUS. They will not even stack the bread properly so as to open a few spaces for paying customers to sit. They smile their fake smiles and offer insincere apologies while telling you to wait for a table as your breakfast gets cold. Horrible service. Sorry you didn't make enough space in your store room for the all the pre sold bread so you're giving it a special seat and making me stand. RIDICULOUS"}
{"text":"We stopped here after one of our kids school event. It was our first visit and was told by friends that it was good. Good example that you should not take advice on food from friends. It was about 6:30 pm and they were not busy and we had to wait for over 40 minutes to get our food. I spoke with the manager and she seemed not to care just saying that they are working on it and she had two new cooks. When we did get the food, the salad had very little chicken on it and all lettuce. We were told when ordering that they were out of turkey so went with the chicken. Personally, I will not be returning. Sorry, it could be good with better management."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for a sandwich and soup but still delicious non the less. I tried the melt and it was nothing to write home about. Too much sauerkraut and basically that's all I tasted. The turkey bacon avocado on focaccia on the other had. Perfect. I've gotten 3 times out of the 4 trips I've been there. Pair the extra bread on the bottom of the sand which with the cheese poblano soup. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Awful food. The biggest problem I have with Kneaders is that they claim everything is \"so fresh\" and everything I have tried (& other reviews attest) has been obviously frozen. The sandwiches are severely lacking any flavor whatsoever, it's more like bland hospital food. Also, when I posted a picture of their terrible chocolate pie on their Facebook page they immediately took it down. Not very honorable. Their bread is probably the most decent thing on their menu; that is why I'm giving it one star instead of none."}
{"text":"Ordered club sandwich to go for $8.00 - 2 thin slices of ham and a piece of thin cheese.  That's it."}
{"text":"Met the manager, what a GREAT GUY!! Food was delicious and environment wonderful! Coming here again soon!"}
{"text":"So not pleased with the half done pancakes, lack of coffee and two half slices of bacon that was supposed to be a side order. Won't be returning to this location ever. No butter, no coffee and empty creamer containers. Step it up Kneaders. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Marginal at best, short on staff and long lines for food that is bad. Prices are high and portions are low to say the least.  Not to mention its a huge mormon hang out, almost feels like you are in church:(. Save your time and money, get a costco hot dog next door and leave full, happy and with some money in your pocket, not to mention a lil diversity."}
{"text":"I feel that there may only be one employee who is actually cheerful and is not rude working here. The bigger issue is the way they handle/serve their food. I have had multiple problems with the food quality. What pushed me to write this review was coming home to eat my oatmeal and opening up my side of cranberries to see there is mayo on the bottom of the cup. Take a smidge bit of pride in what you serve."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago a friend brought me an orange roll from Kneader's Bakery,  that little roll didn't stand a chance, it was amazing! So today I decided to take mama there. We met a friend there for lunch. All I can say, is I wish there was a Kneader's in Spring Valley closer to my home.  We all had the turkey, avocado, bacon on focaccia bread, holy cats was it delicious! The sandwich was so big we all ate half and took the rest home for an afternoon snack. At Kneader's you're gonna find a pleasant family establishment, within a cozy setting, with friendly staff and fantastic fresh food.  Plus they have some really adorable season items available for purchase. I'm a Kneader's fan for life!"}
{"text":"I almost had a really bad breakfast here. Not really sure why I needed them to burn eggs and give me an uncooked slab of cold fat dripping with grease...I could've just eaten my own terrible home cooking! The pancakes tasted good at first, but after one bite when I noticed flakes of burnt garbage from the grill on them I was done. The only reason they get 2 stars instead of one was because the manager (someone who needs a serious brush-up on personal hygiene - greasy hair, wearing unwashed clothes and a filthy apron) refunded me for the sad pile of slop and I walked away. :("}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place out for a while now and finally got to last night....the drive through was a plus! But the costumer service was terrible. Never even offered if I needed help with the menu and when I got to the window the girl never even said hi, gave me my drinks at the last minute and handed me my bag without saying \"have a nice night\" or saying anything! And just closed the window. I had to check and make sure all was there because with her not saying anything I wasn't sure they were done. The food was good though...definitely liked it. But I'm not sure if I'd go there again and bring my whole family with such rude people. Really? Isn't costumer service your job?"}
{"text":"We love going to Kneaders. My daughter is an expert in all things chicken noodle and sourdough, and she loves Kneaders the best. Their bread is always fresh and soft. Their ingredients are fresh and their baked goods are amazing! I like how reasonably priced their breakfast options are ($4.50ish for a breakfast sandwich). They also have a drive-through which is rare for a bakery restaurant."}
{"text":"I had to visit a few times in order to write a true review.  You can go to a place when it first opens and it's all shiny and new, the employees are fresh, bright eyed and bushy-tailed, but that's not the way it is once the shine wears off - which is what the experience is actually going to be for most people who bother reading reviews.  Most of the times I've visited (especially the first time) the employees were very friendly. Occasionally it has turned to a form of \"know-it-all\" arrogance as if they know what you want better than you do when you choose not to try their menu order suggestions, but of course that depends on who was taking your oder at the time.  The portions are not overwhelming, but they are ample.  While the sandwiches are restricted to what they have on the menu (no \"have it your way\" here) what they have is quite tasty. The bakery items are where this place really shines.  I haven't had anything there that didn't fall under that category of \"I'll have that again\". So, the food is generally good, and at times very good.  Now to the not so good parts.  They are closed on Sundays.  What kind of brunch place is closed on Sundays?  Even more confusing is being open until 10PM on Saturdays.  The absolute worst part for me though, is their drive through They have this script where they go though the whole \"Welcome to...\" thing which is a few beats too long, only to attempt to give you even more time with \"please take some time to look over the menu and let me know when you're ready\", and they say that (and everything after) at about 110MPH.  As a native NY'er I tend to speak at around 90MPH, so now I know how annoying that can be to the rest of the world.  Then, after all of that, they are SO SLOW to actually get your order to you.  I usually order just a croissant sandwich (or two) or a couple of almond croissant, and I have never gotten out of there in what you would think is a reasonable time for a drive through. Yes I have worked at drive throughs before.  The person that worked the drive thru this morning just keep a conversation going with the car in front of me after they received their order and just let me sit there waiting until they were done. And was my order waiting for me when I finally drove up to the window? Nope. More waiting.  Last, but not least, it's probably the 5th time out of maybe a dozen that I go there and they don't have any almond croissants.  At 9am on a Saturday morning they're out of a popular menu item?  That's just poor management and planning.  If they don't have what I actually come for with more consistency, they they're just not worth the trip.  I just want the food I'm looking forward to, without wasting my time."}
{"text":"I had an egg cheese and ham Sandwhich for breakfast.  It was good enough that I would definitely return to this place and try other items.  I arrived early so I didn't experience the lines that other reviewers have mentioned.  I write this though a line is forming.  The flow of the restaurant is not great.  It lends itself to the creation of bottlenecks (long lines).  They do have two registers but they are very close to one and other and they seem hesitant to open it.  The dining room is also chopped up do the place can feel small and overly busy.   The person who helped me at the register was very friendly.  That aside the spirit of service doesn't seem to be quite as high as it is at paradise bakery or a chick file.   A decent stop though if you are killing time by Costco."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times very disappointing. The first time was for lunch dining in on a Saturday. The service was ridiculously slow, they served my food to the wrong person, that person touched the food, and then they served it to me. The food was bland. The tables were all dirty, they have as many possible tables to cover every inch of that place and when they were emptying the trash, it was disgusting because of how close people were having to sit to that. Today I went through the drive thru, there weren't any other vehicles in front of me or behind me. As the girl stood at the register laughing, I had to wait 15 minutes for a dessert and a drink. That was uncalled for having to wait so long for those two items. Horrible service and not worth the money. I probably won't be returning and I will also tell others that they would be better off going to Paradise Bakery if they want that type of food."}
{"text":"My best friends recently hosted a baby shower for me and the menu was a surprise until I arrived. They ended up doing a \"build-your-own-grilled-cheese\" table and everything was from this Kneaders location.The assortment of cheese was plentiful, the bread was decently sized and perfectly sliced, and extra condiments were thrown in for those that wanted. I found out from one of the party hosts that Kneaders also provided complimentary napkins, plates, and silverware for all 40 people! All the guests were commenting how delicious the sandwiches were. The friend who picked up the order said that Scott (I think that's who they worked with) was very friendly and accommodating with their requests. I have only been in this location once but this experience definitely makes me want to visit more! Thank you for making the food at my shower a hit!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Kneaders I tried going into weeks ago but the line was out the door now I know why. I was just going in to get some bread and rolls and got a croissant sandwich to go everything was delicious since this was my second visit it will definitely not be my last the food is out of this world"}
{"text":"\"Their cinnamon rolls are so good you don't even need the frosting!\" In the words of my 10 year old :)"}
{"text":"Kneaders is awful.  Service was incredibly bad.  Got manager Andrew on the phone to let him know we had waited in line 20 minutes to order our sandwich and another hour before it got delivered to our table.  All he was concerned about was how I got his phone number and I should be sure to remove it from my phone.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"I have to say that this business didn't get it right. The food is not anything special. I ordered 2 different salads and 2 different sandwhiches and it wasn't anything better than something I could make at home on the fly. There was something in the salad that wasn't supposed to be in there and I have no idea what it was. Customer service was nothing exceptional but not bad. Their potato chips are really good though."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great selection - I love that they have a drive through, so I can grab a healthy dinner on the way home. The sandwiches are fresh and the salads are huge! I wish they were open on Sundays, but otherwise no complaints!"}
{"text":"Wow! I just had a great breakfast here! Had the cinnamon pecan pancakes and an egg ham and cheese croissant sandwich. Pancakes were perf ft as well as the sandwich! Highly recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I can't express how disappointed I am at Kneaders customer service. The people they have working there have no idea what's on their menu or how to actually explain it to anybody. We ordered a cake and the girl rung up a different cake and they made it when we picked it up. This is the third time we had a problem Kneaders and it's such a shame because it used to be so good. A little bit of training goes a long way."}
{"text":"My brother and I each had the breakfast sandwich on a croissant and split the cinnamon French toast.  The croissant was flakey, buttery and absolutely delicious. We both loved the cinnamon french toast, which is served with a small cup of whipped cream and thinly sliced strawberries.  There was also a small cup of syrup but I could not tell if it was maple or some other flavor as I used very little of it.  The cinnamon bread was thickly sliced and had a nice balance between sweetness and the cinnamon.  I enjoyed our meal so much, two days later I went back for a bowl of Tomato Bisque soup!  I really enjoyed the soup and can't wait to go back and try their other flavors!    Like another reviewer, I was also confused by the bad reviews.  They DO have combinations now and I don't consider their pricing to be out of line.  I found the staff to be friendly and helpful and did not have long to wait for my order."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pies for Thanksgiving this year because I do enjoy having lunch here. I have never tried any sweets here...but with the abundance of orders they had ready during pick-up;  I figured I made a great decision. I could not have been more wrong. I ordered raspberry cream cheese and triple chocolate....both cream based pies. What a mess!!! The raspberry was runny....and I honestly did not even see the cream cheese underneath. The triple.chocolate had wonderful whip chocolate topping...and again more runny,  \"gloop\" beneath it. Store bought Jello Pudding has more substance and holds up better than this runny mess. Both sliced horribly.  I usually bake my own desserts...but figured I'd pick up what looked like delicious pies. Such a big mistake and waste of money. Sorry Kneaders I love having lunch but will NEVER buy another pie from you again."}
{"text":"It took over half hour to get a salad and a sandwich order. With kids wanting their sticky bun orders it was not a relaxing night out."}
{"text":"Everything is absolutely delicious here. I love that everything is made fresh daily and they have a huge variety. They have a homey atmosphere. The german chocolate brownie is heavenly! Great for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert and wonderful place to buy gifts."}
{"text":"Came the second day was open. Long wait but hey that's expected. Well worth the wait. Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"We love Kneaders! We come for desserts on a quick date or a sandwich for a awesome lunch."}
{"text":"The sandwich I got (turkey bacon avocado) was gross and when I asked for a replacement sandwich they said it was fine. I waited 15min and still didn't get it so I asked about it and they never even put the new order in! Then I spoke to the manager and he was very rude about the whole thing after I got the sandwich a total of 30min later. The cashier was very nice lady but the rest of the experience sucked"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The owner is very nice and accomidated a last minute cake order. Cake is delicious!"}
{"text":"I order the Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich. It was FANTASTIC!! I came here with my colleagues from work. The vibes were right. We also order some pastries and I was actually amazed at how good they were. It was also nice and clean. The Employees were friendly. I would definitely recommend this place. PS: The turkey was not dry at all! It was perfect! Great portions as well. I could eat half and save the other for later!!!"}
{"text":"Who else loves French toast?! Tried their chunky French toast and it was so yummy! The strawberries and cream topping was a nice little touch to add to breakfast. Service was great! Everyone was so full of energy."}
{"text":"This was really good. The line was long, but worth the wait. Got the turkey bacon avocado. Was super fresh and GIANT!  My aunt got the raspberry salad and it was also great. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Kneaders a couple weeks ago.  You had to stand in line to order your sandwich from one cashier which took quite a while.  We both ordered a sandwich and i had a soft drink and my wife a water.  The bill was over $20.  They deliver the sandwich to your table and we were both totally disappointed.  They hardly put any meat on the sandwiches and they were mostly bread and the cheese and tomatoes were scarce.  Both my wife and I wound up taking one piece of bread off and tried to eat them open face and they still were terrible.  We will never go their again. Bad Bad Bad"}
{"text":"Thought I would try out someplace new and heard good things about the food.  I ordered the turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich to go. Based on the wait alone, I will not be returning. It took them nearly 25 minutes for my order to be ready from the time listed on my receipt!? As far as the sandwich...ingredients were fresh, however, for the size of the sandwich (bread), it was definitely lacking in filling. Hardly any avocado, there was twice as much bread as there was meat. Overall, just disappointed."}
{"text":"When they first opened they were A+. Then I had a bad experience at Christmas - didn't have my  online order ready. They scrambled to get something put together for me which ended up being horrible and very disappointing since it was for our family Christmas. Customer service promised to send me a gift card to replace the cost of that Christmas order.  To date I have not received the gift card. Went back today to give them another chance and again was very disappointed. Purchased one of the fresh loaves of cinnamon bread got it home and the inside was hard as a rock, no cinnamon and the glaze all came off when I took it out of the bag.  In the store I had to ask for a bag to put my purchases in, the cashier looked very annoyed.  Wont be going back there!"}
{"text":"Have eaten at Kneaders a number of times. Never really liked the place but go there when friends want a switch from Panera--sooo while there this past Saturday, a man came in carrying his fluffy pooch. Sat down with dog in his arms and proceeded to allow the animal to put its front paws on the table. Then put water and food on the floor under the table for the animal. The animal slopped food and water on the floor. But the paws on the table really grossed me out. Do you think the tables are sanitized between customers??"}
{"text":"I LOVE Kneaders!!They are so much better than Panera!! My friend and I are obsessed with the Turkey,Bacon, Avocado sandwich!! I also love their breakfast items! Cinnamon roll,French toast, breakfast sandwich, It's so hard to choose because they are all so good! I always get great service from this location and they do a phenomenal job on their catering! My family and I have done  many catering orders from this location and it has always been perfect! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Always a disaster. Today was extra crappy. Normally they take 15 minutes to deliver food, but today they said 10-15 minutes for the first time ever. Our food arrived an hour later.   Given the type of food served, EVERY time a customer leaves, an employee should be out wiping a table. In ALL my visits here, I have never seen anyone wipe a table without me asking first."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the new location.  I must say I was impressed!  Nice selection of baked goods and bread.  I had the pancakes.  Don't tell anyone but the pancakes and French toast are ALL YOU CAN EAT!  For $ 5.59 that is a great deal.  And the portions are huge.  They are both served with carmel syrup (yummy) AND strawberries and whipcream.  We will definitely be back.  Only drawback they are not open on Sunday.  The French toast is made out of the same dough as the cinnamon rolls.  So it is a little sweet.  Pancakes taste different but in a good way!!!!!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"New favorite spot! I go to Panera frequently, but haven't tried out Kneaders until today. I am going here from now on! My boyfriend and I got the sausage egg and cheese croissant, wheat bread SEC, turkey bacon avocado sandwich on focaccia bread, and a fruit tart. All are deliciously divine! Compress the TBA focaccia sandwich with your hands for an easier way to eat the sandwich"}
{"text":"They are really popular because they just opened.  I ordered from the Drive Thru. It took 30 minutes to get my order. Ordered the American Omelette which was just sitting in a pool of grease. Disgusting, couldnt even eat it. Their crossaint sausage, egg and cheese sandwich wasnt bad. But again, it was very greasy. The hot chocolate isnt homemade. It tastes like powder. Ive ordered a sandwich and salad from here before. Wasnt thrilled with it either. And their lemonade was so tart, it was inedible. Dont think Ill be coming here again or recommending it to the co-workers. Terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I opted to go through the drive through at this location.  After ordering one sandwich, I was in line for over 20 minutes.  Upon finally arriving to the window, I was informed my order had not been made because it was smaller than other orders and was not priority.  I  waited almost another 5 minutes and was offered a free pastry for my trouble, which I declined.  They should have offered to comp the meal.  The food at this location is always great however I would hesitate to go back due to the time/service issues."}
{"text":"Had to wait so long in the drive thru line that we almost ran out of gas. My sandwich had a big gouge out of the center. I ordered their homemade parmesan chips and they gave me the smallest amount of chips we have ever seen or eaten from a restaurant. Will never go back there or any of their other restaurants."}
{"text":"Great place!!! So many awesome options!! A little overwhelming  as it was my first time visiting.. however I believe that everything is probably equally amazing taste! The service was fantastic the young girl at the register was so friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, with my hubby and we both agree, here is our take.....the order took a very long time for the amount of people in the restaurant.  The breads for our sandwiches were good, nothing to brag about but good.  The ratio of meat to bread is a joke,  the desserts are a good size and we shared, they were good as well.  Here is my rub,  the prices are just  too high for this area.  I wasn't impressed with the decor, it appeared like they were trying to pull off a Cracker Barrel , sorry it's jut doesn't work for us.  I might try one more visit for a salad, but from the earlier comment I might not.  I wish them well, but I'd rather go where I'm seated and waited on for the money we paid."}
{"text":"What a great new place for lunch! The staff is so friendly. The owner is super nice. I had the turkey bacon, avocado sandwich with the broccoli salad. I Will have the other 1/2 of the sandwich tonight for dinner. It was huge!!! And very delicious!! My and my coworkers will be back :-)"}
{"text":"I ordered online for later pickup.  When I got to the drive through, i sat for 2 mins. and no one came.  So I drive around to front, go in and ask for my online order.  Was told they didn't have  the menu item I ordered.  I asked why they didn't call me and was told they started to but were very busy and didn't.  I then asked about the drive-thru and she said they hardly ever look at the window because they're so busy.  If customer service keeps up like this, they will have no business.    And to think I tipped in advance.   And the vegetable pannini wasn't that good.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Check your bag before you leave the drive through window. They always forget at least one thing, no croutons/bread, no salad dressing or the wrong dressing. Every. Time. Come on, guys."}
{"text":"Love their endless French toast and croissant sandwiches. Their cinnamon loaf is really good. I wasn't too impressed with the salad or soup selection. The drive thru is kind of slow at times but the sandwiches and French toast is made fresh. Staff is very friendly. They also have some cute decor items you can purchase. I've bought a couple of cute aprons."}
{"text":"I ordered two cappuccinos, and when I got them, they felt a little light. I opened the cup, and there was a solid two inches of not  coffee between the lid and the liquid. Frustrated, I called Kneader's, asking if it was normal for them to not fill up the coffee all the way.   The manager explained that due to the amount of milk, coffee, and foam they put in, the coffee comes down to that amount, and they just have that one size cup to put the drink in. Despite the fact that they did nothing wrong, they decided to throw me a free drink. The manager I spoke to, Christopher, was very helpful, and made it known that customer satisfaction was his priority.   Aside from that positive anecdote, the staff is always friendly, and the food and coffee is always good. There may be a little bit of a line, but what do you expect, it's a popular coffee shop."}
{"text":"Oh Kneaders... I have a love-hate relationship with this place. The salads are amazing!! The baked goods are delicious! The soups are so tasty! However, as others have already said in the reviews, the service is less-than-stellar all because of the wait time! The wait time is atrocious!  Please, Kneaders, hire more people and/or do better training with the ones you have. I can tell that your staff is not working as a team and too much responsibility is falling on the shoulders of a few. I've literally sat and watched your staff as I bitterly waited for my food and it's a bit of a mess. I think this place has potential. But your staff has got to start working together."}
{"text":"My first time in this beautiful bakery today!! So much selection!! I got delicious cinnamon bread as gifts for my neighbors and the assistant manager beautifully wrapped them in cellophane & ribbons that I got to choose from a wide assortment of colorful choices. Holly helped me at the register & was sweet & professional. And Michael answered all my many questions in a kind & friendly way. I very much felt my first experience at Kneaders was fantastic!! I can't wait to return with my husband for the all you-can-eat breakfast of pancakes or French toast!!"}
{"text":"Went this morning for the first time for breakfast and was surprised that for Mother's Day they were serving up a free French toast if you were a mother. I wanted to thank you for the delicious breakfast you served. Your staff was friendly and courteous . We will be back for sure for there is a lot of things we would like to try. Your decor of the restaurant is very well done.                     Thank you from this mom Cheryl Cormaci"}
{"text":"I went to the location on 75th Avenue with the family today order two bacon egg and cheese on a croissant and crunchy cinnamon french toast at 10:40 half of the food came at 11:05 and my food came at 11:15 definitely not worth the wait very slow and obviously unorganized they also cannot seem to handle having a drive thru and a dining room at the same time"}
{"text":"Messed up my catering order. Missing 3 items even though they were printed on the receipt. Not good when you have an office of hungry people."}
{"text":"I realize this is a chain restaurant, but I had a very good experience and thought the atmosphere was warm and the staff very friendly.  This is to me, is what Paradise Bakery USED to be!  I love the different kinds of breads available and all the pastries on display plus the homey atmosphere without being too overly \"cute\".  I had a turkey sandwich on French bread and it was ample size and delicious.  The prices seemed to be in line with what other places of similar fare cost so I was fine with it.  I will definitely go back and buy some bread and even some pastries when I am in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"This place is extremely over priced for what you get. It literally looked like a 5 year old put my sandwich together. It was sloppy and barely had any turkey on it and maybe a small slice of avocado.  Not to mention it was $9.36 and that DID NOT come with a drink or a side. My sons pancakes were 3 extremely small sand dollar sized. The only good thing about this place is that it has a drive thru. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches and the croissants are some of the best I have ever tasted. Now if they made pretzels they would be perfect."}
{"text":"I really hate to give a bad review, especially when this place can do great stuff. However, I gave them every chance to correct a bad meal and they failed twice. The French Dip was HORRIBLE. Lots of bread, very little beef. The beef was also dry and tasted horrible. When I showed the first person my sandwich with a very thin layer of meat, he said it was normal and it would cost extra to add meat. I foolishly paid for extra meat. The second person who delivered the extra meat said that my sandwich was not right (then walked away without offering to correct it.) Not everything they serve is this horrible, however, this was the worst experience. I will try to post a picture."}
{"text":"I love Kneaders. I thought it would be too busy based on reviews. And sometimes it is, but I've never waited more than 10 min to get my order in and the food always comes very quickly. I love their salad variety. Always such fresh delicious ingredients and lots of whatever meat I order. Their soups are also great and my husband is working his way through the different varieties of bread pudding with each visit. WAY better than Panera!"}
{"text":"Don't quote me, but I think this is the only bakery in Surprise that offers Italian pastries. Their chocolate mousse ganaches and fruit tarts are some of the best I've had. It's a cool little spot to grab lunch or share coffee and dessert with your mom or best friend.  The only change I would make is maybe adding cushions to the benches because they aren't very cozy or conducive to long chats over coffee and dessert. And maybe the music could be a LITTLE louder or some sort of insulation could be installed so I can't hear the conversation taking place 5 tables away and I don't have to feel self conscious about others hearing mine. Those are the only ambient improvements I'd make to this place. The food though, is excellent."}
{"text":"We've been here about 4 times now and can't get enough of this place. I haven't had anything bad. They're not inexpensive but their prices are on par with similar chains such as paradise bakery but with better food. My only complaint would be that they tend to run out of certain breads and desserts latter in the day, but that just tells me that their food is made fresh daily."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but not the least bit impressed with the service. When we had a problem with our order, the manager was not very receptive and had an attitude. We expressed our concerns but I don't think she or this establishment understand what it takes to keep customers happy."}
{"text":"Tonight we went to Kneeders for the 3rd time in so many weeks and as always we were so glad we came. Every time we come we are greeted warmly by Matt and Kera. Matt the night manager is a stand up guy who knows how to run a restaurant. He takes control of everything that the restaurant offers and boy does he deliver! The food is always excellent, the staff is always on task and pleasant and the restaurant is clean, organized and ready to put out a great meal.  Thank you Kneeders for a great meal, great service and a great attitude."}
{"text":"They need to change the menu descriptions.  I ordered the Italian omelet which was supposed to have sausage and mozzarella.  Mine had neither -- just peppers.   I was very disappointed.  No wifi and poor service."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Kneaders! My fiancé and I have lunch here every now and then, and I recently introduced a friend to this place. Their sandwiches are delicious and very reasonably priced (my favorite is the turkey, bacon, avocado one). They also have salads available - my friend had the raspberry one, and she loved it! Their guava smoothie is one of the best smoothies that I have ever had, and the peach and pina colada flavors are also pretty dang good. Their baked treats are so cute and fresh! The team at Kneaders is always friendly and welcoming, and they usually have a sample of a baked good at the front."}
{"text":"Today Scott went above and beyond to correct an error that occurred in the drive thru.  They brought what was missing and much more directly to our front door.  Customer service is alive and kicking at Kneaders.  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I have tried many different things on the menu here and they have all been delicious. Service has always been quick and friendly. They bake everything on site and you can really appreciate how fresh your food is. This is a great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!!  Waited for our breakfast for 40 min.  They had no forks and had to ask for it after waiting 40min.  What a joke....never will be back to this one"}
{"text":"I emailed this restaurant, back in June, because on the last two occasions, when I ordered the French toast, it was just barely brushed with egg mixture, on top and bottom, and the entire middle, was just dry white bread. The first time, I let it go, but the second time, I emailed the restaurant. I got a very nice letter back, from Andrew Evanko, operating partner, stating please come in again, and bring this letter, for a complimentary French toast on us. He stated there was a new grill person, who apparently had not been trained correctly, and to please give Kneaders another try. I was also told my name would be on their wall, when I came in, in regards to this. So I returned today, one month later, and brought in a copy of my email, and showed the Mgr on duty, and once again ordered the French toast. The Mgr read the letter in front of me, so she knew why I had complained in the first place. When I got the French toast, and took a few bites, I noticed it was the same as before. Just a smear of egg mixture, top and bottom, and dry white bread in the center. It was virtually tasteless. How totally indifferent on her part. No regard to the letter of complaint at all, or Andrew Evanko's reply. I walked the meal  back up to the Mgr, and she took a look, and just shrugged, and said sorry, I'll talk to the grill person again. Nothing was said about getting a new one. I left her more than half of the French toast, and told her to show it to her grill person, that this is not how this restaurant originally made their French toast. If they are cutting back, they are only hurting themselves. After three tries, I will not come back here again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Delicious food with real ingredients, reasonable prices, great portion sizes. I have never had a bad experience or disliked any of the food i've tried thus-far! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Got home to find croutons on my salad after I asked for none. No big deal but the black pubic looking curly hair I found a couple bites in ruined it after that. Thanks for the loss of appetite and taking my money."}
{"text":"Husband and I came in for breakfast. I had the French toast which is incredibly amazing ! My husband had an omelet and he liked it very much.  We also enjoyed peanut butter cookies and white chocolate cranberry cookies. We also took a loaf of chunky cinnamon bread and sourdough bread home so we can keep enjoying our wonderful experience.  We are sure to go back and again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere feels more like a Cracker Barrel meets Jo- Anne Fabrics.  The all you can eat French toast is really tasty. Served with butter and strawberries with cream on the side.  The catch; you have to go back in line to ask for more. Then there's a wait. Normally it's about 5 mins. This time I waited 10, had to go back on line to ask again. No body took responsibility or apologized for the wait.   It would be nice if the gal who delivers the order would check nearby served customers. On way back to counter."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait, excessively long. I just needed a loaf sliced. Not busy, just not very fast. This has happened two times in the last three months. Maybe if I take up space in their drive thru, I won't be easily forgotten."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been waiting for the Kneaders at 1150 E Bell Rd to open so we could try it out.     The store is clean (of course, it's new) but is well maintained. The menu is pretty extensive for such a small place; walking in between a wall of breads on one side and a glass case of pastries on the other side started my mouth watering.   My friend ordered a club sandwich and I ordered a French dip so that we could split them and try two sandwiches at once. The club was fabulous; the meat was fresh, not processed and the lettuce, tomato, and onion were also fresh. The bread was so good!  I was a little disappointed in the French dip; the au jus was a little too salty for my taste and there wasn't much meat in the sandwich in comparison to the club sandwich.  I was too full for desert but the pastries are calling my name even today!  Will be going back to try the soup and other sandwiches as well as breakfast.  Very excited to have a Kneaders close by!"}
{"text":"Excellent food all around. Altogether we ordered French toast, omelette, and two different sandwiches and soup and all surpassed our expectations especially when considering the price. Completely shocked at the quality for the price when comparing to local competitors."}
{"text":"I've been to kneaders 3-4 times and I've enjoyed it each time. The chosen location is a little interesting considering there is a paradise bakery less than a block away. I think the two restaurants are nearly identical in selection and quality. The advantage of kneaders and the reason I have been a repeat customer has been the drive through which is very convenient for breakfast. minus 1 star for being closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"I've heard that these guys are all the rage for breakfast. I've tried to go to the Mesa location for months and the lines are so slow that I've never been able to take the time. So... I was excited when they opened this one and I waited a few weeks for the \"new\" to wear off so I could give it a try.   Sheesh.. what a disappointment. Slow lines, rude staff, I actually walked out and have still never eaten there. I could drive to Tucson and back for breakfast in the time it takes to have a meal at Kneaders. If you have a life or a job... you don;t have time for these guys! I guess that's why the place is full of stay at home moms and their kids..."}
{"text":"Went with my family and the service was friendly and efficient. Try the Zucchini bread it's awesome."}
{"text":"Really surprised by the bad reviews! My family and I eat here regularly and always order the same stuff (veggie avocado for me and they get a turkey sandwich) and it always tastes super good! I like how their bread is fresh and you can even taste how soft and well made it is. I haven't tried their sweets yet but they look so good!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! My first time trying this place, and I'm soooo impressed. I know it's only been open a couple days and I visited during the lunch rush, and I personally know how the first couple weeks of opening a new restaurant can be a make or break type situation, but the girl at the drive thru intercom was very bubbly, polite and patient with all my questions, I didn't wait very long for my order, and the food was just fantastic. We got three different kinds of soup with you're honey wheat bread, a turkey cranberry croissant sandwich, and a caramel macchiato. All of it absolutely delicious, hot and fresh. Definitely going to visit many many more times in the future and recommending this place to everyone I can. Keep up the great work guys!!"}
{"text":"Ugh I hate to start a review like this but it is necessary. This morning I went through the Kneaders drive thru thinking it would be quick and easy, being that all I was ordering was 2 almond croissants. There was only one car in front of me but by the time I left, there was a line of 10+ cars. The car in front of me sat at the drive thru window for maybe 15-20 minutes, no exaggeration. They should have had the car pull forward if the order was that complicated and not trap the cars behind it. What if someone had to go to work, or school, thinking the drive thru would be quick? So finally the car in front of me leaves and I pull up. The girl at the window takes my money, repeating my order back to me correctly. Once she closes the window, she STRUGGLES to open the register and get the correct amount of change for me. Then she begins to take another order through her head piece and begins typing in completely ignoring the fact that I'm sitting there waiting for my change and 2 almond croissants. This goes on for 2-3 minutes. Ok so now I'm mad. I've been sitting in this drive thru line for 25 minutes and the girl can't even do simple tasks that someone working in a drive thru should definitely be able to do. So after asking her to open the window, I tell her this is ridiculous and I have been sitting here for 25 minutes which is unacceptable. She proceeds to say- \"ok?? sorry we just opened..\" That is not a valid excuse and you should know how to do your job correctly. So I just say give me my food I'm ready to go. She hands me a bag and I drive off. When I get home, I realize I didn't even get what I ordered!! She gave me 2 ham, egg and cheese croissants instead of the 2 almond croissants I ordered. Overall Kneaders employees clearly aren't ready for real life customers and they need to go back into training. This was such a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Love Kneaders Rueben sandwich. Club sandwich is also delicious. The cannoli' are also excellent. We really enjoy having them in our neighborhood. Also appreciate that they have a drive through and are open until 10:00pm. Very good on almost every visit. Very convenient."}
{"text":"I had no choice of zero stars, or that would have been the grade. Been there several times, and am waiting for why anyone would ever go there. As usual, long line, help absolutely uncourteous, then no tables to sit, finally found one with dirty plates etc, waited 10 minutes for someone to clean up. Probably should have known that food would be slow as well.Slow, 22 minutes from time of sitting down till it came, no sorry, I had to go and get it. I can see why cinnamon roll and breakfast sandwich would take that long, yikes. The food, breakfast roll had cold everything and still trying to figure out where the egg product came from, but it too was cold. Cinnamon bun was average at best. If you are looking for slow service, below average food, not done food, this is your place...and at a high price tag."}
{"text":"I want to love this restaurant .. unfortunately, they don't seem to care much what their customers think. When  I recommended we visit today, my husband replied \" we always have mediocre service there and inconsistencies with their ingredients\" rarely is Anything prepared the same. With convincing, he agreed to make it our Lunch  spot today. Unfortunately, we again received mediocre service and our food was not adequately prepared ( missing items ) and  the employees again are not informed  on ingredients in items we requested, and don't seem very appreciative of their customers or their needs."}
{"text":"We are on vacation and try new places that we've never been before. Wow this place was a great decision! Great sandwiches, good soup and the kids eat every bite of theirs too.   Friendly staff and to top it off my wife is requesting a pastry for dessert. We will be back each time we visit for sure! 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"Don't fall for their buy 5 get one free cookie deal! It's no deal, each cookie is regularly $1.79, so i got 5, and was charged $1.42 for 6! the manager tried to explain that is how it it equals one free, but if you do the math 5*$1.79=$8.95 and 6*$1.42=$8.52, so you save exactly .43cents, how is that one free cookie??? And $11 for lunch, which includes a nearly empty bag of potato chips?! I think i'll stick with the $6 footlong at subway or blimpies! the cookies are good there and cost much less!!!!!!!  Almost 2 months later, and no one from Kneaders has reached out to me about my complaint, lost my business!"}
{"text":"Hi not sure if businesses read this or not but I want to let people know that I had a great experience, with the exception of a rude cashier, I wish I would of had her name, but she was using the register of Matt at least that was the name that showed up on my receipt. Although I thought we would try it for the first time and the actual manager I am assuming Matt was right on, friendly offered to make our meals combos, offered us samples of what they were offering and they even offered us three different kinds of cake for free to help celebrate this location's one year anniversary, everything was good from that point on and I should have left well enough alone. Well when I went to throw my trash away the bin was full to the top and almost falling out and I had to push it down to make it not overflow and to me that is not what a customer should be doing. Also the table had not been cleaned or wiped down from what I could see since I had to wipe down the one we chose to sit at. Well the food was excellent and so was Matt. But when I chose to browse the gift section I found two Halloween items and waited patiently to check out. Well when I arrived at the register it was not Matt who made my day, but some young teenager who I assumed was not in the mood to work , because she not once greeted or even said hi to me, she looked for the tag and scanned and told me the total, took my card scanned and asked if I wanted a receipt which to me should not be asked it should be assumed a customer wants a receipt if they are buying something to prove they paid for the item and not just walked out with it and also to have in case of exchange which not once did she mention to me their policy. After she handed me the receipt I had to ask for a bag, really little girl you need to learn to deal with the public if you are going to be the first person someone sees when ordering and buying something. She did not bag my items but laid the bag down on the counter and not once said thank you ,but gave me a look as if I was bothering her. Kneaders/ Glendale Arizona off the 101 and 75th avenue, I have the receipt to show I am not just writing a story. Please consider who you are hiring and that they are customer service oriented and you are not just hiring to fill a position ,but hire someone that likes dealing with people and that realize that when customers stop coming in is when businesses close and or go elsewhere. I hope this does not go on deaf ears and that no one else experiences the rudeness of this rude individual."}
{"text":"We have been here twice over the past 3 weeks for a quick dinner. BOTH times our orders were wrong after we confirmed with the woman at the counter taking our orders. Last night one sandwich had so much mustard it was coming out everywhere and the bread was soggy . The other turkey and cranberry - that was a joke. A little turkey in the middle of the bread with a small piece of lettuce and some sweet awful cranberry spread that made the bread soggy, too!  NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"The drive through is terribly slow.I ordered a small salad and drink. It took 30minutes to get to the window and the kid did not address me at the window until 5 mins later then another 5min goes by and I finally got my salad with hardly any turkey meat. Yes... 40 minutes for a salad and a drink. He acted like I was a inconvenience to his day. There was no apology for the wait. Upper management really needs to take a real hard look how they are operating and treating customers. I will not be going back ."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTED!!!!  I went here at 8:00 on a thursday night.  I ordered the turkey, avocado and bacon on focaccia , a cannoli, parmesan chips and water.  First of all, they were out of focaccia, so I had it on a baguette.  Then, when i got to the window, she told me they were out of cannoli so she offered me a mousse dome.  Then she came back and said they were out of that.  So I got a brownie.   The chips were stale.  Like they had been sitting out all day.  There was NO bacon on my sandwich, and the bread was tough tough tough.   I will give them the benefit of the doubt and maybe try once more, but for the price, it was definitely not worth it. One more thing...it is October 9, they were completely decorated for...CHRISTMAS!"}
{"text":"I spotted one of these back in Henderson while visiting family. As I was driving around in my area, I found one nearby! I told my hubby to make a quick turn so we could try some pastries. The decor is really cute and makes you feel at home and the employees are super personable. We decided to go with a lemon muffin top and a double chocolate brownie and we loved it!  Definitely will come back for lunch..my daughters birthday is coming up and we need to find someone to cater..."}
{"text":"The food is amazing so 5 stars for the food but not sure waiting 23 min in the drive through is worth it...I could have just gone on a bad day and got stuck behind a car that ordered a lot but I would just go in and order. The lady at the drive through wasn't very pleasant either....  Went through the drive through again and waited 25min only to have them get my sandwich wrong...so pissed. If I decided to go back it would only be for a fruit tart or cannoli.."}
{"text":"Gave it a try at dinner.... only four people visible waited at counter for 3:23 person taking order is serving too... Again this has to be a management issue.  People were running around...  Plenty of other options in vicinity... Still waiting.... I'm done..."}
{"text":"20 min and no food.  Is it because I'm Mexican?? I could not eat my food with the people I came with. Also too many teenagers working here I had to hear one little girl complaining about how her ride had been there for 45 minutes and how she just wants to eat and get out of there and a teenage boy was sitting in his dirty uniform with a friend who had come to see him and they both had dumb smile on their faces staring at everyone like they knew something about the food we didn't."}
{"text":"Won't come back if we have the kids with us....Waited 20 min for a breakfast sandwich, piece of pie and a brownie. Thanks but no thanks.... Oh and the pie wasn't the one that I ordered"}
{"text":"Thank God there is a great sandwich and soup restaurant other than Panera and Wildflower.  Kneaders is THE best.  Not only is the quality of food FAR above Panera and Wildflower, but the service is close to a perfect 10.  Go, order your food, look around at all the fun knickknacks, get a treat, and enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the speed of service the last few times I've been here. I love the breakfast pastries, but I don't know if I will be back again. STOP TALKING AND GET MY ORDER READY!"}
{"text":"Wayne was awesome at getting customers in and out.  I came here yesterday with my daughter and her friend. Wayne was awesome. I came here this morning with my son, Wayne was awesome again. Then I can back after dropping my son off at work, with my beautiful love of my life and ate the French dip. Yummy. The amount of meat with grilled onions was an abundant amount. Very tasty. It was real busy too! I will return. I read a comment on here about a customer complaining about him being Mexican and the service he received.  Well, I am Mexican and I was not discriminated against. All negative comments are from people who are not happy with who they are. Live on the dark side and receive what is dark. Kneaders in Surprise is a positive in my life!"}
{"text":"I've been here 30+ times, for breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee... it's amazing. They do all these things, and they do them beautifully. Here you fill find coffee that is as good or better than Starbucks (Illy Gran Filtro, one of my favorite coffees), PLUS pastries, breads, sandwiches and soups that are prepared fresh on-site daily. The prices are very reasonable, and the quality is just excellent.  The management and people working here are super friendly and knowledgeable. You can tell they love what they do.  They also have a drive-through, but I've never driven through, as I like the ambiance. It is decorated with hardwood chairs and booths, a stone fireplace, and granite tables. Yes, granite tables! They also cater, deliver, and have great specials. It is great to sit, relax and catch up on work or reading.  This is perhaps the best kept secret in Scottsdale. Come give it a try; I hope you love it as much as we do."}
{"text":"I got the the turkey bacon avocado salad and it was freaking amazing!! The turkey was super moist, and the bread they served with it was super fresh. Everyone was very helpful and it was super clean. For sure going back!"}
{"text":"I love fruit on my salads, they have a raspberry salad that is really good, also the pastries are heaven.  Good portions, fresh bread and the stuff was really nice"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this location, I tried a panini with the hazelnut  12 grain bread and I loved it. Store was really clean and stuff friendly."}
{"text":"The drive-through line takes forever. If two to three cars are in front of you, it will take at least 20 minutes until you're out."}
{"text":"I stopped by this morning to get a to go order.  Ordered a bacon, egg and cheese on a croissant, and Banana Cream French Toast.  My daughter's  Banana French Toast is very good.  I open the croissant sandwich and it was ham, not bacon, egg and cheese.  Do they know the difference between ham and bacon?"}
{"text":"I don't know how people are writing bad reviews, everything we ordered was excellent. Parking kind of sucks and the line was kind of long but food came out quickly. I ordered the harvest veggie panini and it was too bomb! I also decided on a citrus cannoli and it was probably one of the best I've ever had.   One of my main complaints is that you have to actually look up the menu online to see what comes on each entree but that's not really a big deal."}
{"text":"Don't understand the hype over this bakery/cafe/restaurant. Experienced stomach upset after eating a bland chicken sandwich. Purchased bread at this store as well and found it to be nothing worth writing home about. Pastries lack creativity, instead infused with loads of sugar to perhaps appeal to the masses. Really miss Breadsmiths! Kneaders strikes me as a mass production bakery where quality ingredients and creativity are sorely lacking. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious and quick breakfast. My only complaint was the fruit cup was clearly not fresh. The pancakes were light and fluffy. The syrup a little too sweet for my taste but the fresh strawberries and whipped cream were the perfect topping. My bf got the sausage egg and cheese croissant. Real fresh ingredients! Will visit again. Quite the treat!"}
{"text":"I came with my family the other day for breakfast. The all-you-can-eat french toast or sourdough pancakes are just $5.99. Very good (sweet!) and you probably won't have room for a second plate. My kids had the cranberry coconut oatmeal. It was ok, but that just kind of how oatmeal is in general, you know? It was clean, not too busy and I love how they offer free samples at the register. My only complain was that the only utensils that were out (like by the drinks and napkins) was knives. I wanted a second spoon and there weren't any out there. I haven't had anything besides breakfast, but I would definitely be willing to try something else. Their crafts are cute too."}
{"text":"Well I ordered the large salad and what I got was a plate full of lettuce and a couple of pieces of turkey. Really what a joke. I did get plenty of onions. I had to dig to find some tomatoes.  You get the picture. I would not return.  Gift items were cute."}
{"text":"While I lived in Utah, Kneaders became one of my favorite places to eat. Good quality food and always fresh. Their service is known to be slow but the food makes it worth the wait. Now, imagine my joy when I found Kneaders had come to Henderson. My daughter and I took a drive over. The wait in the drive through line still long, but the food was terrible. We had ordered chicken noodle soup, which was overly thick and had an odd taste. My daughter ordered a chicken chop salad. The majority of the lettuce was already showing signs of spoilage with brown, slimy edges. Now the  desersts,I ordered 2 raspberry bread puddings and one German chocolate bread pudding. After our long wait in line, once we arrived at the window we were told that there was no more raspberry bread pudding. The young woman at the window offered the apple in lew of the raspberry. I agreed on the apple and asked for a slice of strawberry pie in place of the other order of raspberry bread pudding.  The pie was just a glob in a container and did not even resemble a piece of pie. The bread puddings were chunks of dried up pieces thrown in a container. And the $1.00 in price difference between the pie and the bread pudding was not  refunded to me.  This particular  Kneaders needs to head over to SLC and see how it's properly done.  I never thought I'd say this but do not go to Kneaders."}
{"text":"Love this place. Me and my boyfriend get the turkey artichoke and the Ruben with different assortments of soup and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"They have screwed up my order all three times I have been there. Drive-thru takes forever...seriously just turn your car off to save on the gas.  Overall, food is good but not worth the wait and can't screw up customer orders."}
{"text":"I've only been to Kneaders twice but they didn't disappoint either time. I got the turkey bacon avocado sandwich and a slice of pumpkin cheesecake.  My bread was very fresh. The turkey was plenty. My sandwich was delicious.  I would recommend this place for a light lunch that keeps you wanting more!   This time when I went to kneaders I got the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant and it was delicious. I also got a cinnamon roll to go with it. It was really big and it was just so delicious. It had lots of icing and lots of cinnamon."}
{"text":"Experienced Kneaders for the first time and it was great! Ended up getting the chicken pesto panini which was delicious! Everything about the sandwich tasted fresh and flavorful. The sandwich was a nice size as well. It comes with these parmesan chips which could easily become an addiction for me. I loved the parmesan on them. Soooo good! I decided I wanted to try one of their soups, so I ended up making it a combo for a few dollars more. I got the loaded baked potato soup which was terrific as well. It was a smaller serving of soup, but filling because it was a thicker soup with lots of potato chunks. Yummm! The combo also comes with a fountain beverage.  The decor is nice inside the restaurant, it's a bit of a cozy atmosphere. They have a gas fireplace inside which will be nice for the colder months. All in all I was quite impressed and am looking forward to my next visit there, which will be soon I'm sure."}
{"text":"Home of the broken ice machine and the 45 minute wait for 2 sandwiches!  The management of this establishment is a MESS!  Avoid this at all costs!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely adorable. Very nice staff and peaceful environment. Not to mention the food is absolutely delicious. I would totally recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I usually love this type of restaurant.  Had never heard of Kneaders, but since the place looked busy, and smelled yummy when I walked in I decided to try it.  The line to order at the counter gave me ample time to check out the gift items and bread for sale.  Ordered the chicken salad croissant.  She took my name, and I sat at nearby booth to wait listening for my name.   Four times customers returned to counter to tell them an item was missing or wrong as in mayonnaise on sandwich not the ordered mustard or missing item all together.  The mother and daughter sitting across from me decided to give up waiting for their food.  They got their money back.  I waited 24 minutes for my sandwich which came with tiny salad.  Since it was \"National Carrot Cake day\" I ordered piece.  Croissant was perfect.  Chicken salad was okay, but very skimpy.  Cake was heavily spiced and overly frosted with disappointing cream cheese(?) frosting.  I have never NOT finished carrot cake, but it just was not worth calories and I left most of frosting on plate. Staff was very unpracticed and inattentive.  I saw no evidence they cared about customer experience.  The baskets the kitchen kept putting up looking as if they were meant for distribution to customers were ignored too long by the two young girl servers.  Not sure if I read it correctly, but the lack of work ethic I observed was obvious.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"The food was good and the staff was working hard to provide good service. My daughter spilled my drink and they came and cleaned it and gave me a new one right away. Kneaders is a unique place to be. They also have some nice home accessories and decor to purchase in the store. I got an egg white omelet with spinach, mushrooms, and peppers. My daughters shares some scrambled eggs, a fruit cup and silver dollar pancakes with fresh banana. My wife got a turkey, avocado, bacon sandwich on a croissant, the turkey was moist and fresh and the bread was great. This was the second time at a kneaders and it was another good experience. I would recommend getting there when it opens. They started to get busy fast."}
{"text":"So 2 stars for the food. Soup was ok but it's brought to you without silverware and the only kind available is plastic. The cranberry orange white chocolate scone was dry and over cooked. Didn't have any white chocolate in it either. Service 2 stars. Ambience 2.5. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Food is great. The price is good. If you can't find something good to eat here you're dumb and should just stay home."}
{"text":"I've gone to this location a few times in the past couple of months and I'm really not impressed with the food to price ratio. Although the food is good, I feel like they place way too many limitations on what items you can get that can be paired with one another. Also,ordering over the phone can be a little ridiculous because of this. For example, if you simply want eggs, some sort of meat, french toast , and some oatmeal, you would have to order the french toast separate, then add eggs and the meat, and order a separate combo just to get the oatmeal. I've had better options at Panera and IHOP lol."}
{"text":"I bought cinnamon bread, a loaf. They couldn't slice it because it had sugar on top. I thought why didn't they slice it before putting gooey sugar on. Well I bought it anyway took it home and took it out of the bag and went to slice it and got the sugar frosting all over my hands. Then I couldn't get it back in the plastic bag. I threw it out 5 dollars. I won't even go in there again. Zero professionalism. Cupcakes were stale. Cannoli had huge air pockets with no filling in them.  I can't rationalize waisting all that money again. I also bought bread which was probably old because the next day it was stale. Sorry kneaders. Never again."}
{"text":"Although their food is freshly made and  homemade desserts ,Breads, soups orders to take a while even at  the drive-through and there prices are a few $$$ Been a few Times and they always keep running out of certain bakery items or sandwich items in fact their harvest roasted vegetable sandwich which is on the menu they don't even offer that anymore so they need to update things.   Service is always very friendly very helpful when ordering especially inside. And if you're inside then you can see the wonderful selection of bakery goods and pies cakes brownies tarts wide selection of goodies. They also have custom baskets that they make and they do them seasonal as well all kinds a little cute retail items to buy fun place , but keep in mind they're closed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I really liked the food. The sandwiches are good sized. Employees are friendly even when it is a fast pace order! Loved the set up abs the feel!"}
{"text":"Excellent bread on the beef dip sandwich. Holds the au jou perfectly.  I think the amount of beef on it is fine, but could see where some may want more, if so, order with extra beef.  Soups are amazing.  All items in pastry case look fantastic."}
{"text":"People with allergies beware. I specifically asked what the lemonade was sweetened with and was told sugar. It didn't taste right so I asked to speak with a manager and he tells me that it is actually a sugar substitute. Didn't even offer to replace the drink. I'm very sensitive to sugar substitutes and they need to train their employees not to give information to customers unless they are sure they are right. In my case I'll just get a stomach ache but other people could have anaphylactic shock based on their bad information and lack of care."}
{"text":"We have gone to this location twice now as it's located close to daughters swim class. This company has got to have the slowest employee in America working here. We sat in the drive through for about 30 minutes waiting on a 1/2 salad. The salad was good but definitely not with the wait in any capacity. I truly hope this location either hires more employees or undergoes extensive training on speed."}
{"text":"First time at kneaders today! Went for breakfast and it was so good, the staff was SUPER friendly, and the service was super quick! Definitely will be going back ASAP!"}
{"text":"I went there with high expectations and they certainly did not disappoint.  The decor was very nice and clean and I was greeted with a smile and friendly hello.  The sandwich was fresh very tasty.  I also added on a smoothie and it was awesome as well.  The price for what you get is very good.  This is going to be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by their breakfast!  Breakfast sandwich was made with real eggs and perfectly crispy bacon.  My iced caramel macchiato was comparable to my favorite Starbucks drink (which I very rarely deviate from) and the cinnamon roll was fresh, soft, and also amazing!"}
{"text":"I've only bought a loaf of bread and it was very good!  I'll be back for more!   The menu looks great."}
{"text":"Kneaders could use some improvement. Here's what was noticed the Monday after they had a day off because they are closed every Sunday (not a wise business choice if you ask me but I'm guessing it's due to their religious connotation #revenueloss). Employees are not motivated. During a holiday and busy rush time they had two employees on break occupying a booth while they are completely out of coffee and sugar. Empty tables not cleaned up. It's a sign of poor management and understaffed."}
{"text":"This place is somewhat like a Panera just with less options. They're cinnamon roll was hyped up so much so I thought I'd give it a try and it was okay, but not anything spectacular and special like I was looking forward to. Also my cinnamon roll wasn't even warm. It seemed a little over cooked or something, because it was a little dry and hard, but softer towards the middle. I also had their French toast, because the picture made it look delicious and made my mouth water haha but once again it was just okay and didn't look like the advertised picture when received. For me it wasn't really worth the hype, but don't knock it til you try! My smoothie was super good though! I think it was a going guava!"}
{"text":"My aunt and I went here one afternoon for a late lunch.  I am from Chicago, so I used to be an avid Panera goer and have yet to find anything up to par with those yummy sandwiches!  I ordered the Turkey bacon avocado and it was delicious. I got the deal that came with chips, pastry and a drink! I love that they had so many choices! Their fruit tart sure is tasty!  Sadly, I reside in Phoenix so I won't be swinging by anytime soon but it was good while it lasted!"}
{"text":"We've tried this location several times for lunch. In all cases, the wait to order at the counter was very long. They often have just one person taking orders when they should have two or more. The turkey bacon salad was very good and fresh both times I ordered it, but the broccoli cheese soup had lumps of un-dissolved thickener in the bottom.  And yesterday we not only had to wait several minutes to order, it also took more than 20 minutes for our salads to show up. The woman who delivered them apologized for the wait and said she had to \"help the guy in the back catch up\".   Based on the other reviews, this location has issues with consistency of quality and customer service. I much prefer Panera."}
{"text":"What and enjoyable place to come and give your business to!!! The atmosphere is cozy and so clean.  The selections of baked sweets is bigger and better then your average bakery.  Not to mention the food tastes good! But what really stood out to me is their service! Everyone there starting from the manager is so lovely and professional in the way they run business.  They went above and beyond making sure my family and I have a pleasurable first experience with them.  I wish other companies would run their business this way.  Too bad they don't have a location in Dallas because i want to recommend this place to everyone I know.   Never been to Kneaders before till now but this Scottsdale location sure left me with a great impression."}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place since I've seen them pop up in Vegas. Save yourself a trip. Stick to Jason's Deli, Cafe Zupas, or Capriottis. The only thing that was nice was they had a drive thru. The Reuben was weak for $10, probably a few slices of rubber meat and served with about 4, what appeared to be kettle chips, in a brown bag. A $10 sandwich should keep you full and this was not the case. Poor in taste, and quantity"}
{"text":"Maybe not a five star restaurant but certainly five stars as far as fast food goes.  Way better that McDs or most other fast food joints and a lot healthier too.  I have only been there once but I will return.  The place was clean, the food was good and the employees friendly.  Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, two times I went inside and once through the drive thru and have been disappointed each time.  The first time I had a salad with chicken & strawberry which didn't have very much flavor and it was on the small side. This was during their first week of opening so I decided to give it another try and went through the drive thru to get two sandwiches (both panini) & once I got home I noticed my order didn't have the side included and the sandwich barely had enough meat to make one half of a sandwich.  My husband was disappointed in his sandwich as well. The third time I went inside with a friend to have breakfast and decided on the French toast. It was cold and dry so I asked for a replacement and ended up with another cold, dry breakfast.  It wasn't even warm enough for the butter to melt.  I wanted to like this place but I won't be returning.  I'll drive a little farther and get Zupas or Panera."}
{"text":"I work close by and watched the building go up but I didn't know what it was. A ton of my customers were super excited that it was going to be a Kneaders. If anything I was stoked to have a bit more variety for lunch.  The first thing I had was the French Toast. I don't really order french toast often but it was recommended to me so I figured I would give it a shot. Totally nailed it! It was light and fluffy on the inside and a crisp golden brown on the outside. I will say it was a bit too sweet for me so I probably wont be ordering it again (but I do recommend it ).  I did the drive through for the french toast a few days ago. Today I called in an order for a french dip with cream of broccoli soup. The sandwich looked like it had too much bread and not enough meat. Turns out by adding the au jus you get perfection. The cream of broccoli was great as well.  Overall I would highly recommend trying it out. Just don't be ass and complain about the line."}
{"text":"The 2 stars is only because the food is good. No issue with the food- the service and people working here are awful. Drive through gets the order incorrect every.single.time. A man who appeared to be the manager, was extremely rude when I told him that there is an issue every time I come. He was not apologetic, he was not understanding, in fact he didn't speak at all when he handed me my food and slammed the window shut. I will never be back to this kneaders.A shame."}
{"text":"Quality, fresh, delicious salads!  Highly recommend the Southwest BBQ chicken salad.  Super nice employees.  They really seem to care about customer service!  They go out of their way to make sure you receive the best quality & service.  Love this place!  ps - super affordable, delicious breakfast as well.  The French toast is sooo yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for the first time - one croissant sandwich, one grilled cheese and a broccoli soup.  When I was handed my bag immediately noticed that my \"croissant sandwich\" had been made on sourdough.  So, automatically annoyed by that.  The whole reason I ordered that sandwich was for the croissant.  Normally I would have just ignored it but I did ask them to fix it, since that is really the whole point of a croissant sandwich!  My sandwich was average - I just had a veggie so it was just a croissant with cheese, lettuce, onion and avocado with \"Kneader's sauce\" - aka mayo with maybe a little mustard mixed into it.  My girlfriends grilled cheese the \"muenster and provolone melt\" had three slices of bread and only one slice of cheese between each layer of bread.  They claim to use \"pesto butter\" but I couldn't taste pesto at all, and there was so little cheese it was basically like eating a stack of buttery sourdough.  Could have done without the third slice of bread in the middle and actually made a cheesy grilled cheese.  The cream of broccoli soup was average but the cup it came in was tiny and only half full.  Overall everything was edible and inexpensive but there was nothing I would go back for, there are many other sandwich shops in the neighborhood that offer better food than this and can get it right on the first try."}
{"text":"Our first time eating at this location. I really enjoyed the Kneader'r restaurant in Denver.  So I heard there was one here in the Henderson area. We were there for a quick breakfast. I ordered a breakfast egg croissant sandwich, guava smoothie and a side of almond croissant. They were very good. My daughter loved the free pumpkin bread. The price was reasonable, it cost under $10 for that meal. We'll be back to try some of the other pastries and baked goods. There are so many to choose from."}
{"text":"I always wait with anticipation to get my Kneaders fix when I travel to Arizona and Nevada.  The 12 grain Hazelnut bread is always on the top. Of our list."}
{"text":"I tried the drive through and I could not hear what the employee was saying . I placed an order and it was completely wrong . I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but their drive thru service is terrible.  I have gone through the drive thru at Kneaders about 5 times since it has opened.  I am not sure what the problem is, but the drive thru seems to be badly miss managed.  Each time I have gone, I have waited no less then 10 minutes (sometimes with out any cars in front of me), and they longest I have waited has been 18 minutes.   Today I waited for 14 minutes for my one sandwich and one drink.  I couldn't get out of line, because there is no place to turn.  This needs to get fixed asap."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The sandwiches are awesome. Bakery goods TOTALY awesome! Breads magnificent! The ONLY reasons I gave it 4 stars is the new counter staff needs LOTS more training! & prices are alittle high for sandwiches but you get what you pay for here!  I requested provolone cheese on my sandwich & she put it in as Parmesan cheese chips (made for salads!) thankfully person making my sandwich came out to double check such a weird request, so she fixed it and was a great sandwich! They don't confirm which breads you might want & have a hard time figuring out what the prices for certain items are if they aren't marked & many of them aren't.  It took two of them to figure out the price of some Caramels I was thinking of getting I finally just said thanks but never mind.  They try hard but like I said being at the counter they should know what they're doing more than they currently do . If you request added cheese or ask what types of bread are available  they don't have a clue & they should, other than that like I said LOVE this place. I don't mind paying more for such great & fresh food!   UPDATE;  I down graded to 3 stars from 4 I would give it 5 stars because I LOVE the fresh food. But the customer service SUCKS!!  At first I attributed poor customer service as they were new but come on!!! TRAIN PEOPLE!!   UPDATE: it's my third time coming here. I called in my order asked if I could go thru drive thru to pick it up... BIG MISTAKE! They couldn't  even FIND the order!! They had to re-take it went inside to wait ANOTHER 25 mins to get it. Then they had the wrong dessert!!  Any pick up orders CHECK ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE!!   I repeat they need better people better/more training ... Whatever I would hate to have to boycott based on poor  C.S/ management as food is so damn good!!  It's hit or miss so best of luck. They've got ONE more chance with me. Update again:  They messed my order again... the manager gave me a free sandwich on my next visit but they messed that one up as well... I give..."}
{"text":"By far the best bakery/eatery I've been too. Far better than ANY of the competition! Wholesome quality food! So happy we found this place we come here almost everyday for breakfast or lunch sometimes both."}
{"text":"Everytime we order online they never have it ready.  They can't seem to find it we are always asked what was on that order?  They don;t seem that busy and yet they can never get it right.  My husband brought it back and it was still wrong.  I had to call them when the manager asked what he could do to make it right I told him to bring it to me as I am just around the corner.  He seems to not know how to manage either.  You would think they would eventually get it right, but I guess not.  We have given them several chances to get their staff trained and get a system that works, but it's just not in the cards for this restaurant.  I'm so surprise they are still in business.  We will definitely NOT be giving them another try they are just too disorganized...the management and staff don't have a clue."}
{"text":"The Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich is sooo DELICIOUS. Love this place, very clean, very inviting and you can also buy gifts as well. They have this stands with a lot of home needs that I totally loved."}
{"text":"Kneaders is the best service and friendly staff ever and they made me feel like back in Utah especially a view from the temple in the early morning!!! It is"}
{"text":"Went here 2 days ago and the line was to the door. I decided to tough it out because their dessert menu looked so good. I waited for about 30 min before I could actually order!! Insane!! ONE cashier took orders. There were about 6-7 other people working and I don't know why they didn't help?!? It seems they were all focused on the drive-thru orders rather than the long line inside. I finally ordered & decided on a whole pumpkin cheesecake. $32.99?!?! I wanted my whole family to try it so I got it because one slice is $3.99!!! After trying a piece at home this is definitely not worth $32!!! I can get a better tasting cheesecake at Costco and it would be half the price! Will never be coming back. I'll go to Panera where the have their stuff together. Horrible service at Kneaders, Cheesecake. Save your time and your well earned money!! Don't come here!!"}
{"text":"Chicken chopped salad was mediocre. Mostly iceberg lettuce with little else, and dressing was not tasty. Such a bummer since I like the idea of their menu."}
{"text":"Not impressed, ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and the bread was loaded with butter extremely greasy and very hard, chicken was tasteless and chewy, very little pesto sauce in the sandwich and with a side of hair. Key lime tart tasted like frozen dessert, and ice tea was undrinkable.  Husband order the Turkey bacon sandwich and said it was just okay.  Bathrooms were extremely dirty, I could see they were not taken care for the entire day. I'm giving them one star because staff was very friendly and nice, atmosphere okay. It feels like a fast food place with a mini hobby lobby inside."}
{"text":"Pastries are amazing! I've done tge drive thru only so far. Service is slow, they take long to greet and give you your order.  Coffee could be a bit stronger, tastes watered down."}
{"text":"So, we decided to give Kneaders one more try and we were highly disappointed again. The plastic containers that our salads came in were so greasy that one nearly slipped out of my hand. Also, the avocados  in my salad were hard and had pieces of the pit still attached. Then, to top it off, my husband and son ended up with the worst stomach problems after eating. My final decision: we will NEVER eat at Kneaders again."}
{"text":"My wife ordered a salad and there was 2 lettuce cores in it.  She asked for another salad and we took it to go. when she got to work the next day and started eating the salad the same cores were in the salad.  they didn't give her a new one the rearranged the lettuce to the top.  I called the Manager and he just said bring it back and we will replace it.  \"take your salad and stick it buddy\"  we are never going back."}
{"text":"Great customer service this evening. Went in for dinner with the kids and ordered a loaf of bread to-go. After we ordered they came to our table to apologize that the bread we ordered was gone and asked if we'd like another type of bread. We picked our bread and they brought us that loaf plus a loaf of their bread-of-the-month. Wasn't that nice?  Top it off, they brought my kids a Carmel apple when they were done eating. Dinner was tasty, appreciated the super service and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Visited Kneaders for breakfast! I haven't had French Toast in forever. It was delicious. I would have liked a bit more of the syrup, the last few bites were dry. Loved the Christmas decor. Charming place to visit. Breakfast menu seemed limited. Can't wait to try lunch. And all the baked pastries looked amazing! Also the hot latte was on the colder side... but overall good.  They have samples of pastries to try!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch to go! My turkey sandwich was amazing. Great ratio from meat to avocado to bread. Tasted fresh. Also ordered cookies and gooey bar which was to die for.  I've had breakfast before which was great."}
{"text":"Able to order a late dinner for a hungry mom and kids and have the bonus of delicious wheat bread for tomorrow's lunches...and all this without leaving my car! Thank you Kneaders."}
{"text":"it was 230pm, lunch rush was well over. Numerous empty tables, but all were dirty with no where to sit that was clean. The ice machine was empty and 20 minutes later it was still empty. the floor needed swept. Cost me almost $5 for a cookie and a small drink!!   Keep driving south about 1 mile and you will find a Panera that is 200% nicer and clean!!! This store needs new management!!  Thanks Paul Ortman Mesa AZ"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  I tried this place for lunch twice and both times I felt robed. The first time I ordered the chicken pesto panini and it was about 1/2 inch thick. I'm not exaggerating.  I had never seen a chicken breast smashed that thin. The next time I got the chicken salad croissant. The chicken salad had no chicken just huge water chestnuts they were just whole from the can. There was very little salad on the croissant. I will say their deserts were good but the prices are high."}
{"text":"This restaurant is becoming hit or miss. The staff turnover is beginning to impact the quality and speed of service.  We ordered pancakes and French toast and watched our food sit on the service counter going cold while staff was chatting, serving the drive up window and trying to refill the empty coffee carafes.......that were empty when we ordered with only 8 people in the restaurant.  A common occurrence at Kneaders. Oh, and we sent our food back to be reheated.  And let's admit it; the French toast is cooked in advance and reheated for each order.  And back to the coffee carafes: why not set out double carafes for each type of coffee served like the coffee in convenience  stores?  The staff is polite and earnest, but many simply lack experience. This place has such great potential.....their bread and desserts are superb, but the staff turnover is hurting them."}
{"text":"My family and I are very happy with the service and the tasty food. This location had not been open for a month yet and even though its always busy, they always get warm food out in a quick/reasonable time. This place is our GUILTY PLEASURE, since we have literally been here at least once a week. Jim Hipp the owner takes pride in his store and is extremely friendly, I recommend KNEADERS to everyone, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Isn't it ironic that the places that would make a killing on a Sunday are closed? I respect their religious views (company is based in UT). I haven't even tried a fraction of their menu, and don't mind going out of my way to get here. I haven't read other reviews, but I must compare this place to a Corner Bakery Cafe"}
{"text":"I have tried this place 4 times and been disappointed and disgusted 4 times. The food, dressings, service, and staff are all horrible. Each time I have been here, there has been no coffee available-very wierd for a pastry and coffee place. The salad my wife ordered was obviously prepackaged and too cold to eat. The salad dressing with it was a disgusting, gelatinous mess. The \"turkey\" in the salad was an orange, disgusting color, if it was turkey at all. Also, an employee was sweeping dust and dirt all over the place, while we were eating!!!!  This place is a HORRIBLE joke!!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE KNEADERS!!!!!!! Delicious, fresh food! Reasonably priced. Friendly staff. Adorable little shop inside!!!!"}
{"text":"I love kneaders! They have such good tuna sandwiches,  the green avocado salad is great, and the eclairs are to die for!"}
{"text":"I love Kneaders! However this place is definitely new. New on Management and Operations. It  took me over 35 min to get a gift card and a pie to go... I had to wait until the pie could be boxed, they had no boxes and once the pie was placed in a large cake box the pie crusts began to fall apart onto the counter. After waiting so long I just wanted to leave so I didn't make a fuss.   The Pumpkin Pie was delicious! It was smooth and creamy and the pie crust (what was left of it) was perfectly baked. I will be back to buy some pie and other pastries. I usually order to go and call ahead to make sure its ready. It can be a hassle but I rather check then waste my time at the counter. I love their boutique items and gift baskets. Looking forward to the holiday breads and cookies from Kneaders!"}
{"text":"Tried a breakfast sandwich for the first time (on top of my bottomless French toast that I couldn't possibly go without) and it was great! I got it on sourdough instead of the usual croissant and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love their Broccoli and cheese soup and their divine veggie avocado sandwich! Only downer is the long waits in the drive thru :/ other then that this place was yummy and I would recommend."}
{"text":"I am really surprised by the low reviews of this place.  I fully agree with one reviewer, this is exactly what was needed on the corner of Power and McDowell.  If you have problems with your orders, I recommend that you talk to them as they are always willing to help me.  Since our first experience about 2 months ago, we have been almost every Saturday and we've taken a few out of town guests here as well, all of whom say something like, \"this is the best sandwich I have ever had!\".  My kids love the desserts, and they even gave me one for free once (a lime tart that had cracked on one side).  I always get the Turkey, Avocado, and Bacon and it's incredible.  Sometimes I save half for later (it's a big sandwich) and it's still good.  The 4 stars is because they are not open on Sunday, and I always end up thinking about going on Sunday...  Other than that, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow great place! great sandwich and soup combo meals, excellent selection of deserts. Prices are pretty good, like some one else commented like panera but better. Also a great assortment of smoothies."}
{"text":"Now we had heard about Kneaders from some friends at Church and really enjoyed going there. I liked the granite table tops and the colors were inviting. The bread selection looked fabulous and the meal selections were delicious. I had the French Dip, my wife had a club sandwich and our daughter had a kid's meal. It was lovely. We'll definitely go back and would like to refer this place to anyone looking for a good meal at reasonable prices. Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd go try the famous Kneaders everyone is raving about, Sign says Open Street sign says Drive thru Open Cars are in the lot Sit at the drive thru for 10 min and nobody takes your order.  Bad.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Bad experience. Food was gross, syrup was liquid sugar, bacon side was burnt up crisps. Garbage overflowing, no paper towels in the bathrooms.  They deserve zero stars but unfortunately we have to give 1!"}
{"text":"Great food, decent coffee and the people are nice. Service is a little slow so don't go if you want to get in & out quickly."}
{"text":"I love this place!! This is my go-to for lunch.  I pretty much always get the same thing, French dip on baguette and a green suntea (delicious).    They have a wide variety of soups, salads, sandwiches, and even some breakfast items.  They also have a variety of pastries and bread for purchase.  The little store is so cute.  Everytime I come here I want to buy all of the items.  They have pictures, affirmations, books, and a bunch of other cute trinkets.  It kind of reminds me of Hallmark.  They usually have free (bread or pastry) samples up front by the register, which is always appreciated :)  Service is great!  They offer a loyalty card which gives you 5% back from each purchase... 5% isn't much, so it takes a long time to earn a free meal, but still worth getting if you come here often!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a couple chances. Ehhh... there are many better places close by,  that are less expensive too (drink for $3, really). Baited by French toast special $6, then the drink for another $3. Food was cold and not fresh. Nothing special, and not worth visiting."}
{"text":"Reminded me a lot of panera but with much better looking desserts. Long line but because it's new that is to be expected. I only wanted desserts for after dinner and I like that there was a separate line for that. Cute country decor and great tasting cupcakes"}
{"text":"We're still pretty new to the area (6 months) and when I started seeing ads on Facebook for Kneaders, I thought I'd check it out.  Since I was in the area, I decided to visit this location.  Walking in, I felt the set-up was very odd.  I saw the large seating area.  That wasn't odd.  But the ordering area was.  There was one guest ahead of me, ordering at the register area, which was directly across from the door, but almost down a hallway.  On the left was a bookcase or furniture piece with all gift type items...knick knacks and such.  On the right was a pastry case and then counter loaded with stuff. I was expecting that the guy behind the pastry case would ask me if I needed assistance, but he never even acknowledged me.  Ok, guess the girl at the register would take care of me after the other guest.  It sounded like that guest was placing a catering order or something.  Again, surprised nobody else offered to assist me.  That guest then said she wanted to get some pastries and she then he to walk back to the pastry case, but was confused that the employee didn't move over to the pastry case too.  She had to keep walking back and forth.  i can't even imagine if there was a line.  When she commented about walking back and forth, the guy who had been behind the case earlier said, \"just yell out what you want, we can hear you!\". It was all just a little off-putting and I'm not sure I'll be back.  I didn't feel welcomed and felt like I needed to memorize the items available so I could place my order.  I'm always looking for a nice bakery to get fresh bread and treats.  Was hoping this might fit the bill, but I'm going to keep looking."}
{"text":"I have seen a few Kneaders pop around town.  This was my first time coming in.  After checking out the menu, I knew this would be a place that I would have to come back to just to try everything that I wanted.  On today's visit, I had the Turkey Cranberry on a croissant.  It was just the right amount of fresh turkey and cranberries to not overwhelm the sandwich.   I also asked for combo #3 which includes chips, drink and any dessert that is priced $2.19 or under.   I chose the key lime tart....absolutely delicious!!!  But as with the sandwiches, I must keep coming back to try all of the desserts I want to try.  I highly recommend Kneaders for lunch or dinner.  They have a breakfast menu, but can't comment on that since I haven't tried it.  This has officially become my favorite sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with my mom and two little girls. We order a kids ham sandwich which came with a super large cookie, the half chicken bacon avocado salad and a half chicken ala mondo salad. The salads were beyond amazing!!! They were both loaded with all the toppings just how we like them more stuff than actual lettuce. I've been to multiple Kneaders and by far this is the best salad I've ever had from them. Then we ordered a chocolate mousse to share for our dessert."}
{"text":"First time to this location and for breakfast. I visit one near my office for lunch often. Everyone was very polite. Got the pancakes, yummy. But looking around the fence toast looks bomb!! I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"Most Kneaders are amazing but this is my favorite location of them all. Delicious food and great service, no matter what time of day. Whenever the Asian dude with the glasses is there I always like to joke around with him and he always gives spot on service. I wish I knew his name so I could give a proper shout out. I recently moved from AZ but will try to go back to Kneaders whenever I visit."}
{"text":"The food here is great as is the atmosphere. The fireplace makes it feel homey, but it was freezing in the restaurant when my friends and I were there. One wore a blanket-like shawl and the other wore a down coat. We commented about the temperature to the woman who delivered our food, but there was no change.  The bakery is awesome! Their homemade breads are terrific. The asiago and 9-grain hazelnut loafs were very, very tasty as where the baguettes. They also offer lots of samples and everything we tried was delicious.   There is a huge pastry counter, but I saved on calories and chose not to indulge.  I will definitely return, but bring my own down coat."}
{"text":"Every time I go here they are out of something and I leave disappointed.  Today I went to get a chicken noodle soup kids meal for my son who was home sick and they were out.  I asked for a different type of soup but they said they don't substitute.  They don't substitute for something they are out of?!  The last time I went they were out of the bread I wanted!  Not only that but they are expensive and they usually get the order wrong.  Not only did my son not get the soup he wanted but they also forgot to give him the cookie that was supposed to be included.  For the price I paid for my family to eat there, could of gone to a really nice sit down restaurant. The food isn't that great either.  Our sandwiches were smothered in mayo and the salads looked like slop.  The line is always long too.  I think I finally learned my lesson and will not be back."}
{"text":"The food here is so yummy and the service is excellent! I will definitely be coming back. If you love French toast this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Turkey bacon avocado, French dip, broccoli soup, and raspberry bread pudding. Everything was delicious. The bread was fresh, meat was moist and plentiful, and the customer service was amazing. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place, the sandwiches, soups, and salad are delicious! We love sitting by the Fire place. My all time favorite salad is the Thai Salad. It's Fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is good here and their pastry case is oh so tempting.......    The help/service here is always mezza mezza. Never have I asked a question to the person taking my order that they can answer......how can someone working there not know what's in a certain item???     Also while we were in line people left cuz it was taking to long to place orders~"}
{"text":"The staff was impersonal and unhelpful. My prepaid takeout order was not fulfilled  properly; one item was out of stock and the other item was prepared incorrectly. They waited until I arrived to inform me that they were out of one of the items.  I was not provided with a refund on the spot and was told that I was going to have to wait until the next time the owner was in the building to 'go into the online ordering system' to manually process my refund. Never have run into that issue in over 20+ years of placing online orders for pickup."}
{"text":"The food is always great and fresh. Love the Turkey cranberry salad/Tortilla soup. That said my lower rating is over the dining area. The music in the dining area was so loud that people were shouting just to speak to people at thier table. I know the noise was not just attributed to loud patrons because in between songs the noise died down to almost nothing.  I like the food but do not recommend dining here with a group of you want to speak or hear what's going on. It makes the dining experience unpleasant.  I honestly was in a hurry to finish up and leave and was relieved when we did.  My father who is hard of hearing even made a comment. Also an FYI to management that this is not friendly to anyone who is hearing impaired and wears hearing aides. The music volume being that loud litterally causes the hearing aide to drown out people's voices and essentially the person doesn't hear anything but noise."}
{"text":"3rd different outlet we've tried.  As USUAL dark roast coffee is empty!!!!  Obviously people only drink dark roast because others are so weak they aren't really coffee.  So keep it filled.  Creamer was also out, why isn't someone monitoring coffee area in the morning?  If you are charging amount comparable to Starbucks, at least have the coffee taste somewhat close to Starbucks.  We love the French Toast, but only if you are at a table with all young men will you be asked if you'd like some more.  If women or snowbird, or both !, staff looks the other way.  Even if I didn't want more, why not be courteous and ask?"}
{"text":"Good food, however I paid $7.00 for a loaf of hazelnut bread with no hazelnuts. Next time I ordered another one and  I told the woman at the counter to be sure to give me the right one because last time we got the wrong bread,she apologized and said she would make sure we got the right one. Then she proceeded to ring up every one in the long line behind me, before getting my head for me. Was I being punished for complaining?"}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow, but my lunch was pretty good. I had the French Dip and I must say that it was decent enough to have again at the price of $6.99. My friend is a huge fan of the Chicken Noodle Soup. I also got a Fruit Tart, don't think I'll get that again. The mousse was tasty, but the fruit tasted stale, something was just off about it. Will I go there again? Sure. Would I go out of my way for it? Not really."}
{"text":"The nicest staff ever works here. The free samples are amazing. Everything we ate was delicious."}
{"text":"Totally digging this Kneaders!  I eat here often and the soups are always top notch!  The staff is friendly and always ready to help!  This is also the cleanest bakery around!"}
{"text":"I like that they have many vegetarian options to choose from and different choices of breads. The breads are always fresh unlike other sandwich places"}
{"text":"This time we tried the French toast. So thick and delicious! We love Kneaders breakfast"}
{"text":"Well worth the battle for a parking space! Everything I've tried has been nothing short of amazing. The bacon turkey avocado on focaccia is delicious. I have a hard time straying from it, but I have to say, their chicken noodle soup is great too. You can't go wrong with a pastry or bakery slice. The carrot cake and chocolate cream pie are perfect for sharing. They also have a drive thru if you're in a rush or want to take your meal for a picnic."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere by the fireplace! They didn't have a tomato soup I was hoping to order so I ordered the Roasted Red Pepper Gouda that was recommended by an employee. It was AMAZING!! The croissants have the perfect flakiness"}
{"text":"I placed an online order yesterday for pickup today at 11:15 am. I arrived at the restaurant at 11:15. The restaurant was not full and I walked right up to the counter to pick up my order of 2 club sandwiches, 2 turkey bacon avo and 2 chicken salad croissants plus 2 quarts of salad. They had just had a large catering order and seemed to have a little trouble finding my order. Once it was quickly located, I waited for about 15 min before it was ready. The food was delicious and prepared well. I appreciate the quality of food, especially that they use crispy bacon on their sandwiches! My only suggestion  would be to have my order ready at the time it was requested."}
{"text":"Kneaders is always a favorite of mine! I love the ham and cheese sandwich on the croissant, and the little side salad that comes with it is really yummy too! It's also really convenient to be able to run through the drive through and get something yummy to eat, that I don't feel gross after eating. This location is always clean and has great customer service."}
{"text":"We were happy when first opened but lately the sandwich's are skimpy and mostly bread.  Definitely slipping.."}
{"text":"Giving this place 1 star is a compliment. The wife and I went for the first time yesterday. As soon as we walked in I noticed the floors and tables had left over food. I noticed employees on their cell phones. The service was horrible. The food well I'll be nice and say either of us had more than 3 bites and we left. Never again!"}
{"text":"This was our final visit. It's too bad, because the double chocolate chip brownies are delicious.   There was only a handful of people in there tonight. All we ordered were desserts. All were ready made, in the case. We waited less time to get five pizzas made next door than we did for dessert to go. When I expressed my frustration, the manager said there were a few tickets ahead of us and that's why we waited so long. I told him it's always like this. No further explanation, and when he brought our order, the chicken shit wouldn't look me in the eye - just gave it to my husband and ran away.   The other visits were just as bad. Long waits inside and at the drive thru, orders screwed up (only to find out when we get all the way home) and moldy bread on a sandwich. Twice.   Our favorite was when a teenager (not sure if he was an employee or a friend of) jumped out the drive thru window to run across to Starbucks. We almost hit him. Twice. He was going to go back thru the window if it weren't for us.   We've given them more than enough opportunities. There are plenty of other places to spend our money. Places that appreciate our business and put customer service first."}
{"text":"Yeah, not a fan. There was little to redeem my first-- and more than likely, last-- stop. The restaurant was very crowded-- there were things all over the place. The seating was very close together; there was merchandise stacked all over the place. The staff was not friendly, or helpful. Since this was our first visit I hoped for a little more assistance while I was looking at the menu-- there was none to be found. As a matter of fact the cashier had this slack-jawed look of bewilderment all over their face and didn't greet us when we first stepped up to the cash register. The food was not that great either-- very small portions in relation to size of the price. Most of our order was just below warm and put together sort slap-dash. Unfortunately the food looks much better than it tastes."}
{"text":"I was excited to have a drive thru that had seemingly healthy options. Picked up lunch just now and I'm disappointed- my kids lunch was missing the side and my sandwich as did my husbands lacked any sort of taste. We actually threw out the other half of our sandwiches opting not to waste our calories. Maybe we will try breakfast but no more lunch for us again."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff... however.... the salad and soup were VERY average. The turkey tasted like it came out of a can which is crazy. Overall real underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Our food was fresh. Cant wait to go home and eat my chocolate covered strawberries! I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Prices don't disappoint jf you aren't picky about quality. Sandwiches are from about $6.99- $8.99. The chicken pesto panini was so so, the bread didn't have flavor. Dad tried the turkey artichoke focaccia but said the bread was tasteless. We are big bread eaters so we are pickier about texture and flavor. Soup isn't from scratch. Reminds me of a Zuppas- but with more dessert options. Pans of brownies, large pudding pies that look store bought. My chocolate chip cookie was under baked but guess some prefer it that way?  You can order at the counter or do drive thru. If you are tired of burgers and tacos for fast food. Kneaders at least has better options for fast food. I didn't know it was a chain restaurant so they have thoughtful food options and even gift items. Tip- from 2nd visit- crowded at 8am. The drive thru line was long so I went inside. It was the senior citizen crowd with coffees at almost every table."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is so good! They also had like 5 different samples of desserts and I couldn't help myself! I will most definitely be back, never going to paradise bakery again!  Update to my review today, this place always wows me. I had amazing customer service today, I think it was the manager, his name is Gino, he gave me a free loaf of pumpkin bread! He's always very kind when I come in and truly has amazing people skills! Thanks Gino!!! You know how to keep your customers happy!"}
{"text":"Good soup green chili pork.  Staff remembered my name! Tasty decaf coffee.  No Wi-Fi so working during lunch is tough.  But good food."}
{"text":"This bakery has awesome cheesecake for only $3/slice!  I got the German chocolate brownie as well; delicious."}
{"text":"LOVE this cute soup and sandwich restaurant.   I don't know where to start, you walk in and there is fresh baked good, from cinnamon rolls, brownies, and by far my FAVORITE the orange rolls are simply amazing.  There's country store where they sell the most cutest items for the kitchen etc.  The customer service is excellent and they answered all my questions while I ordered lunch and picked up 2 dozen orange rolls for my co workers .   They have a genius rewards program , 5%back it gets added onto your rewards card and you can minus from future transactions.   I will be back and thank you for opening near my home!!"}
{"text":"It reminded me of Panera except there is a huge array of sweets, such as pies, cake and brownies. I didn't see any lighter options. Not a good place for watching calories. I was disappointed that their Breakfast menu is very small they end availability from it promptly at 11am."}
{"text":"We watched person after person leave frustrated or ask for a refund because they got tired of waiting. The wait was over an hour and the place isn't even close to full. We could not figure out why no one was getting food. The drive through is moving. Maybe that's the problem. Either way, I won't be coming again until they work out the kinks.   The food was good and they did give us a free meal to redeem later. I'll just wait a few months before I use it."}
{"text":"Just stopped by to order a drink, wanted to see what it was about considering it's right across from where I work. Walked in and was surprised.. This place is like a perfect cross between Paradise Bakery, Starbucks, and Hobby Lobby. I was greeted by two girls at exactly the same time when I walked in, which was pleasant. Then looked at the menu for a bit, very similar to Paradise, which was my previous job. She asked if I was new here, I said yes and that I used to work at Paradise, and she shook her head and immediately said it's nothing like Paradise.. Which is funny because it definitely is. Just ordered a Piña Colada smoothie and got it within 2 minutes.   Overall not too bad! I'll try to stop in there again to update the review.   #stayposted"}
{"text":"Ordered the upside down chocolate mousse was a quick stop... place looks really nice it's not that big but has decent amount of sweets and gift baskets and other stuff to buy. They also have a small space close to there check out some free tasting of cookies and breads which is really nice I just hope they out signs or someone to watch make sure people won't use there bare hands touching the food or provide. Anyway the chocolate mouse was really good would come back and try the other pastries they have."}
{"text":"I love the food here, their chunky cinnamon toast is the best and I love the coffee. Lunch is delicious also, wonderful soups and sandwiches."}
{"text":"It was a big mistake on my sister and I to go here around 10AM on a holiday (MLK). It was completely packed with patrons inside and the drive-thru line was long. My sister said she hadn't gotten to eat-in yet, so that was what kinda motivated us to go in, and I didn't get to try either of the 2 Vegas locations yet. I'm patient for the most part, especially understandable when it's a holiday.  I gotta admit this though: I wasn't too impressed with the food or coffee. We both had the bacon, egg and cheese croissants. She had a latte and I had a cappuccino. It was definitely fresh - cooked to order. Coffee beverages cannot and should not be compared to specialized coffee establishments.  Even though it took awhile to get everything, the staff was honestly nice and courteous. Also have to give them credit for working hard, even if they were behind - EFFORT. I can appreciate that."}
{"text":"First time here today, well deserved 5 star, staff were amazing, food fresh and to order, prices are extremely reasonable"}
{"text":"Hey Hey my Az peeps I recently went back to this place and the food is always delicious but it was a disappointment because the place was messy , really ...clean your tables and floors people . That speak volumes to your customers . My advice ,order it to go !!! If you go enjoy !"}
{"text":"This has been my first experience at Kneaders and it was super pleasant! The kiddo asked to come here after doing some back to school shopping and I'm happy that we tried it! She had a ham and cheese kids meal, I got the turkey artichoke focaccia and the hubby got the pesto chicken sandwich. Our server was super friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. We mentioned that it was our first visit and she helped us pick out the perfect items for our taste. The shop has a good variety of baked sweet treats and a little area where they can put together gift baskets for you. I loved the homey feel and good food! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Kneaders! They have tasty breakfast available all day and you can't beat the pricing on their all you can eat pancakes and French Toast!  Their gift basket station is super cute! I also can't wait to try their cakes, I've spied a cute one to buy for my daughter next month. Overall I am pleased with everything about this location, the service and cleanliness are on point and there is always easy parking! Good job!"}
{"text":"Won't be back. Ordered a meal that came with oatmeal... it was literally plain oatmeal no toppings, even when we asked. The fruit was gross, out of season no flavor. There was no carbonation in the soda. Not satisfied"}
{"text":"First time at any kneaders.  Wasn't sure what to expect. Cute decor, real Italian coffee ($1.79) & my kids loved their treats - chocolate dome & ultimate cookie bar. Husband wasn't too happy with the key lime tart - kinda soupy and not tart. It was freezing inside so much so I couldn't stay for long. No wifi which is a big problem for me so unfortunately I couldn't come back anytime soon anyway. Was expecting more bread choices vs pastry desserts. No bagels, no challah .... bummer.  But staff was nice and facility was clean."}
{"text":"The staff are always positive and friendly. Great customer service is why I keep coming back to this location. The food is also fantastic and facilities are clean. Good job guys"}
{"text":"I heard fresh made bread and I was like on it!  On entering I was in bread heaven! The aromas that filled this place instantly warms the senses and I was ready to indulge!    We tried their turkey cranberry sandwich and the signature turkey avocado club.  The sandwiches are big and you can also choose just about any bread they carry.  We had ours on their country sourdough bread.  DELICIOUS!!!  My favorite and go to sandwich is definitely the turkey avocado club which has carved turkey their special sauce, avocado, onions, lettuce and bacon.     I also was offered a delicious pumpkin chocolate chip cookie to try and I think I even closed and rolled my eyes back with my first bite like shut up this is so darn good!!!!!  I have come back for sandwiches time after time but that cookie has me finishing my sandwich fast to get to it.  Soft pillowy pumpkin goodness with just the right amount of spices and chocolate chips.  I really hope it is not a seasonal item as I would be super sad.  My husband likes their mint chocolate brownies which were a seasonal item, but due to popular demand are now a permanent offering.    Carbs and calories definitely do not count here hehe, but seriously I look forward to continuing to come back and making my way around their menu and bread baskets and pastry cases.   The place is nice and clean and staff is smiling, however expect a wait, as good bread, pastries, sandwiches, are in high demand"}
{"text":"Eh. Dined inside and the line was incredibly long and very slow. One cashier was confused when ringing in orders. The other was more concerned about handing out mint brownie samples. Those were actually the best part of the experience. The drive thru was visible to us and it was moving far more quickly. I ordered the turkey bacon avocado salad. The dressing was very good. My first few bites of the turkey made me question if I was eating chicken, turkey or tuna. My friend ordered a chicken salad. Our salads looked the same. She didn't know which meat she was eating either. The chicken salad came with a fantastic pink poppyseed type dressing. There is nothing about this place that is crave-worthy. Can't see going back since I will never have nothing better to do besides stand in line for 30 minutes. :("}
{"text":"Service is quick and friendly.  I LOVE their French Dip."}
{"text":"This place is way too expensive for a teeny tiny sandwich.  Save your money and go to subway instead."}
{"text":"They might have the worst customer service out of any place I've ever been to in my life.  6 employees standing around doing absolutely nothing and they can't grab 3 pastries out of the counter. In less than 15 mins. Hope this place closes soon with the way they treat there customers. 12/19/2016 approx 7:30pm"}
{"text":"Good alternative to the poor selections us Far East siders have. Food and service was good, but they must offer deep snow bird discounts causing slim pickings on finding a place to perch and eat. I'm sure the summer months will be less crowded."}
{"text":"I went to this location the other day for breakfast. Took like 20 minutes to get my food. At this point it was cold and my French toast tasted horrible. Everyone raves about this cinnamon stuff. Guess I got a bad batch? Told the manager and she seemed too busy to care. However they did reimburse my money. She has a few sisters that work there. They all appeared to be in a bad mood. The young guy at the register was very nice, he told me he works 6 hour shifts without breaks. Sounds like the company treats their workers crappy. I know a gal that worked at this location briefly. I told her about my experience and she said it took a month to get her final check. Bad business practices. The owners should be ashamed. Hire managers with great customer service and start giving your employees breaks. They seem to work very hard. I feel your food is a bit over priced as well. I'll stick with Panera, Wildflower, and Paradise bakery."}
{"text":"Went last night to grab a bite at 7:00 pm via drive thru.  Tried to order a turkey ranch on Asiago.  We're out of Asiago.  Ok, 12 grain.  We're out of that too.  Ok, surprise me.  My husband orders broccoli soup.  We're out of ALL soups.  Fine, I'll just have a chocolate dome.  We're out of those.  For real? Ok, we'll just have the sandwich.  We pull up, pay, and wait 5 minutes at the window.  Finally, the manager comes to the window to tell me they're out of TURKEY!  Seriously??  So I tell them to just make me a chicken pesto panini.  I'm starving.  I get home, and my chicken pesto has ZERO pesto!  This place is a total cluster.  They should've closed early for the night or something.  What a disaster.  And a disappointment."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Kneaders Bakery around 4 times now.  I pretty much get my food to go for me and the missuses since I am in the area working out.  It is quick and on the way home.   I had the ham and swiss sandwich with potato chips.  They put a mustard sauce that gives the sandwich a good taste and I love it.  My honey bunny had a BBQ chicken salad.  She said it was good too. I did get one piece of lettuce that had brownish part on it.  It was no big deal I took it off and ate the food.  The rest of the lettuce on the sandwich was good.  The salad lettuce was all good nothing bad at all.  The chocolate cake was good and the chocolate chip cookie was good too.    I am not sure why this place has some negative reviews.  I think the food is good.  The staff can be a bit slow, but the food has always been good."}
{"text":"The drive thru here is terrible.  Generally speaking the food isnt bad but going through drive thru is always a big risk.  They ALWAYS forget one of our items every single time."}
{"text":"My wife and I had no idea this place existed, but we're glad we stopped by.  On the Saturday before Father's Day they were giving away Free French Toast for Dads, so we came in and indulged.  My breakfast was great, and my wife had a tasty Breakfast Sandwich.  You come in, order at the counter, sit down, and then they bring you your food. The prices are affordable (even without free french toast), there's a ton of seating, and the staff is very friendly.  They even have a drive-thru!  If you're in the area looking for a good breakfast, I definitely recommend it.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"1 Star for service 3 Stars for the food *Averages to a 2 Star experience at this location because, Meh...I've experienced better.*  Let me preface this review by saying....I have had better experiences at other Kneaders Bakery locations (in Utah.) I am hoping it was just an \"off\" day or something?  Oh my goodness the drive through was so slow, and the customer service by both the girl who took my order & the one at window was horrible. Not sure if window girl was just flustered due to being busy or maybe having a bad day but yikes. She was not pleasant or personable. She snatched my credit card from my hand with attitude and tossed my food at me through my car window after i paid.   Recommendations for food:  - Turkey Bacon Avocado Salad w/ranch (or) Turkey Bacon Avocado on Focaccia (same as the salad but on bread.) The turkey is roasted and pulled/shredded which is delightful and the bacon is crispy. - Turkey Cranberry Sunflower Salad. The poppy seed dressing is scrumptious. - Cinnamon French Toast for breakfast is awesome, if you dine-in it's all you can eat. It's served with fresh strawberries and a caramel syrup that makes you want to lick the plate when you are finished.   I sure hope this location gets their house in order, if their customer service is made a priority then maybe their rating would come up. Go for the food, not the service!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to meet for breakfast at Kneaders, because we have heard many good things and wanted to confirm with our own tastebuds. :) I ordered the ham and cheese croissant and absolutely loved it! It was very filling and tasty, with the right amount of meat and cheese to offset the bread. I also ordered coffee (went back TWICE for more!) and it was piping hot and fresh. One of my friends ordered the all you can eat french toast plate (one serving was all she could get through!). I snuck a bite and it was delish. It was served with a lightly sweetened whipped cream and strawberries, as well as syrup, both on the side. My other two friends totally copied us and ordered the same things. Haha. The restaurant is beautiful with wood and stone accents, a fireplace in the middle of the dining area (I don't know that it functions much in Phoenix) and a little shopping area filled with farmhouse style decor. The employees are kind and helpful. The coffee was in high demand, so they had to continue to refill the carafes with fresh java, which I appreciated. It took a while for our food to be delivered to our table and we didn't get it at the same time; probably because we ordered and paid separately. They were very patient with us--we didn't leave for a looong time (talking and laughing). I plan to come back and try their sourdough pancakes next! Yum!"}
{"text":"I love Kneaders but I hate hate hate this location!!! They close early all the time and blame it on \"computer issues\" yeah right! I've even placed orders online and when I go to pick it up, the doors are locked and the stupid people working in there ignore you when you knock on the door. I will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"Lovely place for a casual lunch.  I was meeting a friend for lunch to a place that was new to both of us.  When we lunch together, the motto is 'Sharing is Caring'.  So we shared the Chicken Salad Sandwich, Turkey Artichoke Panini and some bread pudding. I'll start backwards with the best part ~ dessert.  The bread pudding was cinnamon apple that had a wonderful warm glaze drizzled generously.  The large piece had rich flavors that superbly topped off the meal.    The Chicken Salad Sandwich was a little let down for me.  I felt as if they were a bit skimpy on the filling.  With that being said their ingredients were more fillers and not a lot of chicken.  I would recommend skipping that option.  I did, however, love the turkey artichoke panini.  It certainly beat out the previously mentioned sandwich with a great combination of ingredients. The focaccia was toasted perfect for my taste.  On the side of each sandwich we opted for their Roasted Red Pepper Gouda soup.  Beautiful flavors in each spoonful.  I would love that have it again.  Another option I love are all of the fresh baked breads and treats to take home with you.  Along side them are shelves adorned with little knick knacks, decor and gifts.  The service here is genuine and friendly.  The ladies helping gave me a happy experience.  I hope to return to try other menu options."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after a day of shooting sporting clays.  I had the club as always with a nice little treat.  My sister had a salad and my niece had a soup.  They both agreed the food was good and want to go back.   I recommend this place to anyone.  It was around 9 am and they were serving breakfast.  The breakfast did look good too.  I wake up at 4 every morning so I eat really early.  I think next time I will sample some of their breakfast items."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious breakfast. I wasn't super impressed with their sandwiches and they are closed on Sunday's which brought it down a point. Other than that, it's good!"}
{"text":"I like their breads they use on the sandwiches... and I like the cute country ish charm about the place.  Oh the scone with coconut and pineapple was good.  I tried to find more positives from the three visits I had here but honestly I'm not feeling the enthusiasm unlike the cult following this franchise from Utah has.   Yes, we know they are brand new and popular but stuff like all your carafes of coffee already empty 45 minutes into your first hour of opening, Execution or lack of execution of some of the orders I had.  Soup salty,  French Toast, eggy... ugh.... Im over my case of FOMO for Kneaders.   Both times I just tossed my meal and drove down over to CraftKitchen and had real breakfast meal and the one other time drove to Kitchen Table and had creamy heartier soup, for pretty much the same price!   More like this place is last resort for me since they are open late and have a drive thru... but even that, ya know what a PIA the parking lot and getting out is here? Try crossing four lanes of traffic on Eastern with cars flying down from Anthem! Good luck!"}
{"text":"a bit disappointed on how two employees treated me. i walked in today 7/11/17 at about 3:00pm. I waited at the register for about 4 minutes and no one noticed me. Some other lady walked in a few minutes later and her and i just stood waiting to be assisted. Finally a cashier noticed us and went straight to the lady saying \"hey i thought it was you!, nice to see you again, what can i get for you?\" i was a bit disappointed that i was skipped just because the cashiers buddy walked in. I stayed silent and thought to myself \"no biggie, mistakes happen, im sure the cashier wouldnt skip customers on purpose to get to her friends\" then the cashier starts having a long conversation with the lady who cut me about their personal lives, again i understand that customers like to talk sometimes. 2 minutes into thier conversation I looked at the lady who short cutted me and notice she has Non slip shoes, and a hat saying \"Kneaders bakery\" so i get mad and leave knowing that an employee would cut in front of her own customers on purpose, not feel guilty or say anything, and choose to have a long conversation with the cashier that im almost sure knew that i was waiting for some minutes long before her budy/coworker appeared. i was on a short lunch break and had already lost time..  other then this i must say this restaurant is definitely a very nice and clean looking one and hate to give it such a poor rating because of two employees"}
{"text":"First time visiting this cafe yesterday.   Very similar to the Paradise Bakery chain.  Kneader's Bakery had friendly servers this day.  Great tasting chocolate macaroons!  Fresh, moist and chocolaty!   The strawberry tsunami smoothie was just okay.  I will stop by again to try their meals."}
{"text":"They HAD the best Carrot cake in the city, slice of unbelievable. .  Replaced with a sorry looking cake in a cup, I am never repeating my purchase. .  Boo Kneaders, boo  You just lost one of your very first customers,  who would drive out of the way for your carrot cake.  BOOHOO and good bye"}
{"text":"Tried this quiet little spot today for a quick breakfast. My son had a breakfast sandwich and loved it m, especially the croissant. I had the chunky French toast very good taste. Only suggestions not to microwave the syrup it was very hot and I did not expect it. Also if they had WiFi we would have stayed longer. If you want a quiet place to relax and enjoy a breakfast great place to go. #lfthx"}
{"text":"Wow! Great service and spectacular food! We had the French Toast and the pancakes.  Delicious!  French Toast was thick and one can drizzle as much of the caramel syrup as you want!  The regular pancakes were just as delicious!  Will definitely have to come back and try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"The food is nothing special and the employees combined with the weird environment inside is horrible."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Kneaders was a disappointment. We understand it's tough opening a new business having launched several successful ones of our own over the last 30+ years, so where do we start?  How about when we opened the door and it crashed against the large potted plant outside the entry because the pneumatic door closer had come apart. This is a new location and yet no one was addressing the problem, even though several customers AND employees went through it during the 12 (yes twelve) minutes it took waiting to pay for our bread.  Which brings us to the service. Not once were we ever welcomed or even greeted by the numerous staff that looked at us while we entered and then waited. Not that there was a long line mind you... only one woman in front if us with two well behaved young boys who took a long time deciding what to order at the ONLY register that was staffed.   Even though there was a second register next to the one where we waited no one came to assist. Not the employee who looked to be the manager that walked up, stood right there, shook hands with a younger man to the left of the register and then proceeded to share a conversation the entire time we waited. Nor did the girl who walked up to the register and punched a few buttons as she sucked on the straw of her drink. Nor did the girl taking the woman's order ask any of the SEVERAL employees standing behind the counter to assist us, even though she saw us standing there because the woman in front of me was not large.   They obviously take their name to heart, because anyone who bakes knows that if you knead your dough too much it gets tough. This morning when I tried to cut our cinnamon chunk bread it was so tough I could hardly get a bread knife through it. As for texture, though I've never chewed a sponge that was my first mental image because I had difficulty getting the first bite sufficiently masticated to swallow. Taste was also off and quite unlike any cinnamon bread or roll I've ever eaten, and not in a good way. Sara Lee cinnamon bread from the days old bakery store is FAR superior.  After one bite both my slice and my wife's went in the garbage. My wife and I  briefly discussed taking the bread back for a refund but the thought of driving there then waiting another 12 minutes made us decide to throw the whole loaf in the trash and write it off as a learning experience... even though we hate, hate, hate wasting food.  Whoever wrote the franchisee operations manual, should include instructions to spend time in Wildflower and Paradise Bakery stores to see what customer service and quality are all about.  I could easily have made a fuss and probably would have been justified doing so, but that would have gotten my evening off to a bad start so we waited our 12 minutes, paid, said thank you and left, being careful not to smash the door against the planter a second time... even though the employee seconds behind us was not so careful. I wonder how much more it costs to replace door glass than fix a pneumatic closer.  This location is fortunate to be located next to a COSTCO and a Deseret Bookstore because that proximity is the only reason we can imagine anyone bothering to enter more than once."}
{"text":"The French bread was delicious and priced reasonably. The zucchini while tasty crumbled upon cutting.  Access and ordering is a huge problem. There is inadequate room to peruse the many desert possibilities. One family of 4 plus myself and spouse were in line and there was no place to go. The entrance is way too cramped.  Proper customer service training is needed."}
{"text":"I have definitely become a fan of this place after a client suggested we stop by. The bread they use is mouth watering which makes the sandwiches so much better. Since then I have ordered some gift bags from them and they never seem to disappoint!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to have lunch. The soup and sandwiches are always fresh and delicious Not only do they have great food, the customer service is also outstanding. The next time you want fresh and great food stop  in and dine at Kneaders Bakery & Cafe...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant several times because when done correctly the food is actually is pretty good. But honestly 9 times out of 10 there is an error or your hot food sits on the counter getting cold while we're waiting. The staff at this location always appears to have a bad attitude and are not friendly."}
{"text":"Best sandwich place I've had since being in Arizona. They recommended the club sandwich and it was amazing. Couldn't eat but half of it and the potato salad was to die for. It is a little pricey but well worth every penny."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so good!! I got the turkey avocado sand which and it was delicious! My favorite part was the cute gift shop goodies they have to look at while I was waiting for my food! Definitely need to come back for more!!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping this place was good since it was close to our home. First the good my daughter's peanut butter and jelly was pretty good, bread was good she liked the sandwich. Basically she liked it because it came with a cookie. Since it was one of their signature sandwiches I tried the chicken pesto. There was absolutely no pesto on the sandwich it had about a quarter inch piece of processed chicken with three wilted pieces of Basil the an unripe tomato and a couple of red onions."}
{"text":"Another good casual cafeteria-style eatery on Bell Road.  The salads and soups were delicious and the baked goods looked absolutely amazing.  We didn't try them but you have to check them out!  And Kneaders also has a little retail gift-shop type thing going on, which seems odd but I must say - the items are adorable.   Everything was fresh and the facility is clean.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Drive thru is slow... don't stop if you are short on time. I thought the menu was far too pricey to make this a normal stop. Coffee options are limited so the Starbucks next door shouldn't be worried. I got a cinnamon roll and it was moist, fresh and yummy. My husband got the sausage croissent sandwich and he liked it a lot.  I think our total for both items was under $10, but the lunch items seemed to be much higher. Won't be stopping again anytime soon. There are far too many options like this in the valley already..."}
{"text":"Wow , fantastic choices for breakfast and more.   Nice new convenient location off the highway. The Greek omelet and fluffy pancakes with pecans were great"}
{"text":"Great for a good breakfast or lunch yummy cinnamon rolls would give this a thumbs up...."}
{"text":"I had the French dip sandwich.  It was good, not amazing, but good.  I haven't gone back but I would if it were closer to my house.  The employees seemed nice enough."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite...ordered the 'fully loaded potato' soup...usually pretty good..but not today..mushy and tasted leftover from last week...YUK! If I stop at a Kneaders again, won't be this location...they frequently get orders wrong and today butter was frozen hard and they were completely out of pepper!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Gal at the cashier wasn't that friendly but he food and desserts were awesome. I had the chicken salad croissant and the bread bowl with broccoli chowder. Yum!  The cinnamon roll and croissants were awesome! Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"When I got to Kneaders I was pleasantly surprised with the interior. At first glance the place feels very warm and inviting with homey decorations that can be bought. Everything appeared to be clean, well put together, and the staff seemed to be following health code well from what I could see.  The staff seemed friendly; with the exception of the girl who seemed to be too busy to take my order. I was the 2nd in a line of 3- when the cashier yelled over the family of 5 before me asking to help who was next. I accepted the offer only to be rushed into an order. South West BBQ salad and a apple cinnamon bread pudding and a large drink. The salad, drink and desert came to $16.  However, no place, no matter how pretty it looks, should take 20 minutes to deliver a salad. Lucky for me my drink was given to me at the counter; I had gone through almost all of it before my food actually reached me.  Twenty minute wait to be met with a salad that was a huge bowl of lettuce with just a small bit of toppings that got lost never to be seen again once tossed. It was very dry as there wasn't enough dressing/sauce to lettuce ratio.  The bread pudding (while good) came lukewarm with cold at the bottom/center made it a bit strange to eat. As I sat there in kneaders for an hour, I heard at least 3 other customers complain about mixups and the wait.   Overall I was extremely disappointed. If I wanted a wait and a $16 price tag I would have gone somewhere else. First time here and last time here."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this location. The first time I came here, I was immediately pleased by the warm, pleasant and cozy atmosphere. Their servers were nice, but they messed up my order. They messed up two different times, with two different people. My huge order that was this confusing? A brownie. Luckily, their manager was able to fix it and actually give me the brownie that I ordered. Wonderful. I also decided to order a cup of their turkey dumpling soup, which I couldn't enjoy. Why? The turkey and dumpling soup Kneader's offers is a soup with a couple pieces of turkey and a half a biscuit in it. I was as confused as you are. Today, I decided to give it another chance and order a salad. Impossible to screw up, right? That's what I thought too. So, when I pulled up to the drive thru and the kind woman told me to go ahead and look at the menu and that'd she be with me in a minute I didn't mind much. I waited about five minutes before she finally got back to me and ordered their chicken raspberry nut salad. I get to the window, pay, and wait. And wait. And wait. And wait. To give you an idea of how long I waited: the same girl that took my order and that I paid with, opened the window and asked me if I had been helped yet about ten minutes later. Another five or so minutes go by and I finally get my food. Did I mention that I was the only car there? No one behind or in front of me. This is the last time I will ever go to Kneader's. Besides the horrendous first visit and long wait on my second, the actual salad was the last straw. The \"chicken raspberry nut salad\" promised spinach, chicken, fresh berries, feta, candied walnuts, and onions (I ordered without onions). There were no berries and two walnuts. Seriously. I then opened the dressing and as you can see in the picture it's almost laughable. There's been some pretty bad places in surprise, but Kneader's is near the top of the list. The prices don't help much either. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Even Paradise Bakery is better than this place."}
{"text":"I like Kneaders in Scottsdale, but this location consistently misses the mark. EVERY SINGLE time I go there, they are out of chicken noodle soup, bacon, tomatoes, tea,  some staple of a menu item.Tonight we waited 22 mins in the drivethur for food we didn't even want but because they were out of almost everything else. Then to top it off the salads are gross! Lettuce is pink and old looking, very very little turkey and the avocado has black spots.  I'm done giving them a try. Panera bread is closer and we've never had these issues. $30 waisted. McDonald's serves better salads."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. A lot of seniors live up the hill and patronize the breakfast/lunch only places a lot more than anything that is open in the evenings. So having something open until 10p as well as drive-thru really floats our boat. These are the kinds of items we prefer to eat, as a hunk of anything is often too much---meat, chicken. What I have liked so far are the soups (potato and enchilada) and the tuna sandwich (fantastic moist hazelnut bread, filling a bit meager). What I haven't liked is running the engine waiting in line for food I called in. I'd prefer the way other restaurants do it, bringing it out to you when you call from the car. I found the French dip sand inedible, but my dog ate the filling (cheez!). I threw out the \"au jus\" which tasted somewhat chemical to me. The orange roll is awful--also fake tasting. They apparently keep everything chilled, and that's the way you get it. After letting the chocolate bundt cake thaw out, it was okay. The coconut pineapple cake had very little flavor. The OJ, frozen, was better than most (can't beat the fresh OJ at Jamba Juice).   Lavazza coffee is a great brand, but I didn't care for theirs. A quart of soup to take home might be helpful for some folks. I'm trying salads next. Translating Grandma food to fast food might be a good concept, but it's hit or miss, so Yelping will help us sort it out."}
{"text":"This place is great.  A little on the pricey side, but it's worth it in terms of quality. They also have a loyalty rewards program."}
{"text":"Got the turkey sandwich on country french bread. Bread was fresh but fell apart, small tomato slices , 1 limp green lettuce leaf, few red onion slices and a schmear of their \"sauce\". Pretty sloppily made, but the kicker was the wad of turkey tendon. Grossed me out totally. The other turkey pieces were pretty tasty and moist, just not enough turkey. The sandwich was primarily bread. The drive through was on the slow side, took 10 minutes after ordering with one single lady ahead of me. I'll give them another try but can't imagine having the turkey again. Yuk. UPDATE Went back to drive thru for breakfast on way to work, asked for  egg sandwich on sourdough toast, got the greasiest grilled sourdough sandwich that was barely grilled and it had such an off, metallic taste that it was not edible. How hard is it to make TOAST? I can't believe anyone has had a good experience at this place. Needs new management and new cooks. Not going to bother again."}
{"text":"We were there for lunch They were slammed. The line was out the door. I take that as a good sign. It's good enough that people are willing to stand in line. We had to wait a couple minutes for a table to open up. We were served in 7 minutes. I timed it. They seem to have got their act together. The service problems other reviewers complained about weren't there. Our sandwiches were as ordered and were tasty. I had one issue with the pastrami on rye that I ordered. The red onion was very strong and masked the flavor of the rest of the sandwich. Removing the onion fixed that. Are you listening, Kneaders?"}
{"text":"First time here today for lunch and Kneaders did not disappoint! I was greeted by a friendly cashier who took my order. I was torn between the chicken salad croissant sandwich and the turkey, bacon, avocado on focaccia. I went with the turkey sandwich and it was amazing! The bread is delicious and all of the sandwich fixings were fresh. I wouldn't change a thing about how they made it. If you're super hungry, this could be a one person sandwich but it's Big enough to share. I'm coming back to this place and bringing the rest of the family next time. I've heard they also serve breakfast and can't wait to try it!"}
{"text":"So this is really 2.5 stars...It wasn't great, but it wasn't disgusting either.  Went here for the first time for a quick lunch.  I had the \"homemade\" chicken noodle soup.  They let you choose a side of bread from like 10 different options!? That's overkill, but ok...So I chose the Focaccia.  The soup was super average, and the bread was also extremely average and cold.  The hubby ordered the tuna salad samich and it was decent.  Next time I want some soup I'll go to Wildflower around the corner."}
{"text":"very disappointed!! it was busy we understand that....somy husband and i waited.....and waited....and waited...patiently....waited 25, 30 then 35 minutes!!! i went up to the counter as i seen people behind us in line eating. the cashier said sorry there are busy then he looked for our order and said it got lost. one oher note the tables were dirty customers including myself had to clean our own tables to sit down. we will not ever go back!!"}
{"text":"I went thru the drive thru at about 7:30 PM oin a week night.  I asked what soups they had today and the girl said she has about a cup's worth of soup left.  Ok... ordered the turkey avocado sandwich on foccacia and my husband had the bbq chicken salad. My sandwich was just a sandwich,  tons of bread and little filling. My  husband liked his salad, but wasn't the best. For the 2 orders came out to be a little over $20. No drinks, no chips, no cookies. Definitely pricey. We would rather go to Panera where the prices are better and you get more."}
{"text":"I met two friends at Kneaders for lunch 12:30 on a Thursday. The parking lot was packed and the line was out the door.  Ambiance: the restaurant itself is free standing with a relatively small parking lot. Adjacent to the paved parking lot is an unpaved area. Unfortunately there are some fairly substantially large rocks in that area that need to be avoided. However it is a useful area to park in when the paved lot is completely full. The entire time that we were there, there was a line waiting to place orders extending from the cash register to the front door. Despite the length of the line, it was under 10 minutes  to reach the register and place my order. The eating area is very informal with wooden backed booths around the periphery and free-standing tables in the center. Pretty standard for fast food eateries. It has a bit of an oddity. There is a large display of sundry items that can be used to create a gift basket in the middle of the restaurant. The table turnover was fairly brisk so there was no problem getting a seat after you placed your order. After placing your order, you grab a seat and they bring your food to the table. Unlike other restaurants that I've been in that have this method of service, Kneaders does not have numbers that are placed on the table. Instead, the food runner hollers out your name and you try and flag them down as they go by. Very inefficient and a little weird for a noisy restaurant. Service: the folks working behind the counter and the food runners we're all incredibly upbeat and seem to be happy working there. It took a bit longer than I expected to have my sandwich brought out. But I wasn't in a hurry and this was not a significant problem. Also this needs to be forgiven considering it's a fairly new restaurant. Food: I ordered a chicken and pepper jack sandwich on focaccia bread. The sandwich was good, but not great. One of my buddies got the apple bread pudding for dessert. I did manage to steal a taste of it. It was incredible. In fact, if I come back I would consider skipping the sandwich and going straight to dessert. Value: a filling lunch that is good but not great for under $10 is a good value for a fast food restaurant. I will definitely try Kneaders again. It is certainly good competition for Panera Bread just down Eastern from here."}
{"text":"Don't know what is wrong with this location as of late, but they are always running out of something and they have forgotten chips that we ordered, 3 times in a row. 3 TIMES. So over this place. The food is decent, but the staff has issues."}
{"text":"The croissant breakfast sandwiches are very good as well as the  almond and chocolate croissants.  The reason I gave them 3 stars is because their manager, Tom, has poor customer service. Ordered our sandwiches through the drive thru this morning and when we got home we soon realized that our bacon croissant was missing bacon because they put me down for just an egg croissant sandwich.  I called right away and according to Tom I should've heard the order when they repeated it (which they didn't). He offered to give me a bacon. Can you believe that? Not a sandwich but just a bacon so I can put it in my now cold sandwich.  Won't be going there again."}
{"text":"I walked in to a beautiful location with tempting smells and great looking pastries. Yet that's where it ended, no pricing on the shelves, the cashier wasn't rude but was far from having a friendly personality. I ordered a tuna sandwich, a drink and a cinnamon roll. The sandwich had one piece of edged with brown lettuce on it, with a thin smear of tuna that didn't meet any of the crust and if there was celery or red onion on it it was pulverized like baby food and not viable to the naked eye. It was a disappointing experience but I will probably try it again and stick to the pastries in the drive through."}
{"text":"PROS: + So much fresh bread, several varieties as well as seasonal specials. I really like the harvest grain and rye. Pumpkin bread is $1 off in September. + Service was really friendly and polite, checked on me several times. + Cute retail area to browse while you wait, customizable gift baskets available. + Sandwiches and salads are very fresh, available in whole and half sizes. + Baked goods and desserts are really the highlight, especially the tarts and petite cakes! + They have a drive-thru for those in a hurry (haven't used it yet though).   CONS: - Posted menu doesn't provide detail for ingredients in their salads, you have to browse the hand held menu, of which they didn't have extras. I can see the line getting backed up easily. - Pastry case doesn't have prices, so your total may be a surprise. Some of the desserts are under $3 while others are $4+, I'm not sure why this isn't on the label.  - I really don't care for their poppy seed salad dressing. I wish they'd ask for a dressing preference (like how they ask for a bread choice)  as it was unclear what other options are available (again, posted menu can only fit so much info). - No GF options available. I realize this is a bakery, but it's pretty common to have some GF accommodation these days."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and was satisfied both times. This time I had the tuna on hazelnut grain bread. It was amazing! The tables are kept very clean and the girl taking out order was so sweet. I will definitely be back. I saw they have breakfast and I can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"Bland food, subway has better sandwiches. The food is overpriced for the taste. We tried to salvage the sandwich but adding some hot sauce. It did not make the sandwich any better :("}
{"text":"Great food. Country feel to it. Fresh baked bread. All the treats are very worth the calories. They are closed on Sunday's. It's worth a try. Staff is very helpful. It's very busy so be prepared for lines."}
{"text":"My wife and I and some friends have been going to this Bakery/Cafe for 1 year now as today was it's first Birthday for being open. Except for a few staff changes we find Kneaders as one of our Best Coffee Stops around Centennial Hills Area. The manager Amy is one of the hardest working bosses we have ever seen and with a new opening we think that she has done a superlative job. The tables are always clean & tidy and sometimes the coffee gets a lil behind but if it is brought to the attention of one of the workers it is replaced in less than a NY minute.  Our Kudo's to Amy & all her staff for their perseverance in taking care of the place. Amy deserves a nice raise for all that she does for her place & her employees and customers too. Thanks guys for all that you do for us customers."}
{"text":"Well I was a little hesitant about going with the reviews below. But... I thought it was great. I had a panini and desert. The sandwich was perfect. The sample bread was delish. I bake a lot so I am picky about deserts but the key lime tart was amazing. Overall I liked the seating and the food selection. After going to Paradise Bakery for over 100 visits in the last few years, I am excited to have them in the San Tan area."}
{"text":"Breakfast: lukewarm, watered down latte. Dry toast (no jam). Omelette that was described as full of peppers and tomatoes, but was really just undercooked broccoli and half-melted cheese. No syrup for pancakes, just this weird caramel sauce. No fruit on the kids pancakes, one of which was nice and fluffy and two of which were hard and cold. Not sure what happened here, but we'll be skipping kneaders for breakfast from now on."}
{"text":"This place is so slow!! If you plan on eating here you better have time to spare, ugh"}
{"text":"I'm hoping the manager of Kneaders will read this - I will be back because I love your food, but I was disappointed in the service today.  This was my first time in the Las Vegas Kneaders - I've been to some of your Utah locations.  At 4pm today, Saturday, it wasn't busy, and the girl in glasses was at the register gossiping in a not nice way about somebody else.  When I was ready to place my order, I was not asked if I wanted a sample, I was not asked about a loyalty card - I noticed signs for these after I headed out.  I was looking forward to the Pumpkin Chocolate Chip mini-cake that I ordered in my combo but when I got home it was some kind of German Chocolate something.  These hiccups won't prevent me from returning but maybe a reminder to staff that attention to detail and an awareness that customers are paying attention to the things you say is in order.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Loved this Bakery, fresh from scratch bread......great staff....will definitely be going back soon......."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Kneaders! The staff was friendly and the food was really good. I ordered the turkey bacon avocado salad and it was amazing. The way they make their turkey gives it a ton of flavor so I only used a little bit of the dressing and it was perfect."}
{"text":"I have been living in the area for almost three years and was so excited to find a Kneader's nearby.  I can honestly say that I am in their cafe at least 3-4 days/week and sometimes 5!    Everything is homemade!  Their soups are amazing and I eat it every time!  They offer generous slices of their delicious bread or croutons  to go with the soup. Their turkey is the best turkey I have ever eaten!!!  Better than Thanksgiving turkey!!!  Their salads are made with  the freshest ingredients and their desserts are off the chart!  The managers, Dan and Amy, treat their customers with respect and their staff is treated with respect as well!.  They are a happy bunch!  The staff is very courteous and I know them by name and they know mine!  It is always pristine and I always feel valued and appreciated!  It's wonderful to see how they care about every detail.    Their gift baskets are phenomenal!  I always know I can trust the food, atmosphere, the folks, to be consistent!  And, I am so grateful that I can eat so well, so often at such affordable prices!  Kneader's is the Best!  And, this Kneader's is AMAZING!  Marlene Knotts"}
{"text":"This was our 1st and last visit. Bread was stale and virtually no meat on sandwiches. They were also out of many condiments and side items. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"They do not allow any substitutions and are very rigid. Except when they needed to make a substitution.   Sandwiches, salads and soups are much smaller in size than Paradise Bakery with same price.    Unimpressed, will not return."}
{"text":"great breakfast sandwich, delicious cookies and bread! coffee is very average which was disappointing.   also, I placed an order for cookies to be ready at 10am and when I arrived at 10, I had to wait for the order to be put together."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time going to Kneaders. Let me just put it this way, I ate there twice in one day. It was THAT good. The first time I visited the store, I order a sandwich with just turkey and provolone cheese on sourdough bread (I'm picky hehehe). Let me tell you, the bread was fresh, the turkey meat was real and the cheese was perfection. I decided to make it a combo so I added a salad and a drink.  It was wonderful. I went back a second time later on that day and ordered desserts. My mother got a cinnamon roll, my dad got a German chocolate brownie, and I ordered a regular double chocolate brownie. My parents enjoyed their desserts but I especially enjoyed mine. The brownie was rich and moist. The frosting was immaculate! I will be going back to Kneaders. They give fast food a good name."}
{"text":"Kneader's does the best turkey sandwiches -- they roast turkeys on-site everyday and served pulled turkey in their sandwiches instead of processed deli sliced turkey.  Big winner!!!!  Excellent breads, desserts, sugar cookies to die for, and decent soups.    Their staff at the cash registers need a lot more training, though.  I have yet to eat there that they manage the order-taking process smoothly."}
{"text":"It's November 11th and this chain is in full Christmas mode already. Your best bet  here is to go through the drive through to avoid the constant holiday music, decorations and holiday brochures strewn all over the tables. You won't be able to avoid the bad food though even if you don't go inside. This chain's food quality has really gone downhill and unless your over 65 and don't care what you eat anymore, it should be avoided. The chicken salad was boring and tasteless and the croissant sandwich was on the small side for 8 bucks. They include a tiny cup of spring mix with your meal which has no place as a side dish. If your sneaky, you should go inside and eat their free cake samples and leave. It seems they have cut three entire cakes and a loaf of bread for free sampling. Employees even seem bored as one poor guy was wiping off tables he had just cleaned five minutes earlier."}
{"text":"I am not sure about all locations, but this one isnt good. For the past 3x we have placed online orders for pickup they have been out of what we want and they have not called us. So we go down there to find out they are out of something. Last time they were out of our whole order! BTW, they dont update the website with this information. Your better off with Panera or Wildflower since those are just a couple of miles away."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally decided to give this place a try.  We were sorry we did.  I had called and their recording indicates soups available.  We arrived and not a single soup listed on their recording was available.  We ordered, and we sat down to wait for our food.  Lo and behold, about 10 minutes later, we were approached and told they were out of what my husband had ordered.  I think it's pretty important that the cashier know what they're out of immediately, so this doesn't continue to happen (apparently this is norm for this location based on the reviews here on Yelp).  They seem incredibly over-priced, and clearly, there's a management problem with this location."}
{"text":"Kneaders is great! We love their shakes and baked goods. However, the best thing on the menu is unlimited French toast. The employees are always very friendly and the decor is very comfortable."}
{"text":"Only had a quick $5 breakfast here, but it did the trick. Tried the chocolate croissant and it was square style, but contained a good amount of filling and some chocolate on top as well. The coffee was fairly fresh for 10AM and despite a busload of asian tourists, I got my croissant pretty quickly and was out in 10 minutes. Oh and if you use a knife and fork to eat a croissant, don't bother talking to me again."}
{"text":"The food is ok, the baked goods are good, but the service and wait times in their drive through are poor."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. I love their chunky French toast but sometimes it's dry & not very tasty. Sometimes service is good & they're friendly but it's a hit or miss unfortunately. I was here with my grandma today & the girl working the cash register was rude to my grandma & I was kind of disgusted by her attitude because my grandma was slow while ordering but I mean come on... This place is in Surprise you WILL have senior citizens come here... The employees need to learn to be patient and polite."}
{"text":"Unless you have all the time in the world ...keep driving . Very long lines to order while 3 employees stood around discussing the placing of Christmas merchandise. Food was so so definitely not worth the wait . Will not be back ."}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches, soups, breads, and desserts. This place gets packed during lunch time and you can see why. We love coming here for the sandwich/soup combo and we also get a dessert to share."}
{"text":"I had dinner there tonight. It was pretty dead, as I probably missed the dinner crowd. Restaurant was clean and orderly. Great service, and the food came relatively quickly."}
{"text":"2pm visit. People very nice.  Food was a disappointment. French dip had 4 thin slices of roast beef. Not even enough to cover the bread. Salad was fresh and very good.  Not enough in it to justify the price. Desserts and pastries looked awesome. Didn't try any. Could not clean our table because garbage cans were overflowing. Tried to tell someone but no one was around. 2 people waiting to be served. No one there. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Now I'm not big of pancakes or waffles but I am a fan of French toast and I have to say the French Toast here is hands down, out of this world the best I've ever eaten.  They start out by using their homemade cinnamon bead sliced thick and grilled up with a nice thin batter of egg coating, and god love em for leaving the frosting on top of the bread intact.  My addiction to this French toast is because of the syrup, it has Carmel in it, yep I said Carmel. They must put something in it to make me crave it so much it's  ridiculously delicious. You get 2 slices per order and the syrup is served on the side so I always ask for a large extra syrup cup as I don't pour it over the top I dip my toast in the cup of syrup to make sure it's fully engulfed in this tasty yummy deliciousness!   To top it off when eating it there in the dining room they give you all you can eat, a cinnamon French toast buffet and for only $6.   If you haven't had it try It I promise you will love it!"}
{"text":"Ate here last Friday - realized their menu is very limited for me due to the \"specialist\" menu they offer.  I  ordered the chicken pesto panini - what I got was a slimy, tasteless, \"kitty kat\" chicken (like Chinese that use cats and pass it off like chicken, yuck) with a spinach leaf that they \"showed\" to the pesto on white bread that was also just \"shown\" the grill.  It was a tasteless, dry offering - and I will not go back to throw my money away on anything else. Also, the beverage bar was disgustingly dirty, the condiment containers were filthy with dust, grease and gods knows what. The whole bar should be disinfected and then make someone clean it daily......No more Kneaders for me."}
{"text":"The French toast is really tasty and we also ordered an Italian scrambled omelette, latte and a lemonade.  Rated it a 3 out of 5 simply because they should have given me more strawberries with my French toast and I would rather eat the  food with real utensils vs. plastic. The latte was good and the lemonade was  delicious but it is such a tiny cup I am not sure it was worth the money. The  place is decorated very cute and the  atmosphere is very relaxing. The staff was friendly too! One thing I would have liked to see is more descriptions on their menu that is posted. We had to ask what the scrambled omelette had in it and then she  explained that there were  4 different choices... I am all about face to face interaction but if you have a long line it could be held up by a ton of questions since their isn't any descriptions. However, it didn't take long for us to get our food but you need to be paying attention because they call out your name and when you acknowledge them that's  when they bring it to your table.  Will be back to the one closer to our house.  I will warn you that the parking is very limited at this location so if it is busy it could be a problem finding a spot."}
{"text":"There are four tables with people here (including myself) and it has been over 20 minutes to receive a hot chocolate, a pre-made dessert, and a loaf of bread."}
{"text":"Bottom line- we waited for over an hour for the food we ordered. For a \"quick service\" counter restaurant, this place comes far below the mark in establishing its reputation in a town that relies on reliable and quick service food. Will not be coming back. Completely unacceptable. However, the manager did end up coming over and refunding our meal and giving us food vouches for our next visit (if there is one!)  Three stars because the food that we did receive was beyond delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I decide to check out Kneaders for breakfast this morning and we both went with the French toast which was a great decision. It was super flavorful and while the bread probably could have soaked in the custard longer, topped with the caramel syrup and strawberries and cream it was amazing. Also, it's all you can eat (which for us ended up just being one plate because we were stuffed). Kneaders has been our go-to when we want to be healthy but don't feel like cooking - their Southwest BBQ chicken salad is my all time favorite and a huge portion for under 700 calories! We always visit this location since it's so close to home - everyone is very friendly and helpful. We will keep coming back regularly!  #lfthx"}
{"text":"Went to try Kneaders today.  My husband ordered a Fiesta Grilled Cheese sandwich.  He was disappointed as it was missing the \"fiesta\".  It was supposed to have jalapenos and red bell peppers but all we got was a plain pricey grilled cheese.  The girl taking orders must be new as she seemed overwhelmed. There were sample pieces of bread next to the register but she did not know what kind they were.  I asked twice and she said she does not know and made no effort to ask someone else.  Overall, we were not impressed considering the hype. I suggest more training and better quality control.  Perhaps we will wait a few weeks and give it another chance."}
{"text":"The food is still great service great! Sometimes the prices are slightly higher than I would think they should be, however, the food is very good and that does come with a price tag."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped into Kneaders today for lunch. I had the club sandwich with a cup of broccoli soup and a soda. She had a tuna salad sandwich with chips and a drink. Both of us were happy with our choices and enjoyed our lunches. We both added a dessert-for me the chocolate mint brownie and for her the key lime tart. Both were delicious. The service was excellent and the food was great! I highly recommend this yummy place. Just wish there was one closer to my house in the southwest part of town!"}
{"text":"I give it no stars. I ordered the French Dip. It consisted of a roll so hard it could not be chewed. The cheese had sat so long it was like plastic. There was only two thin deli slices of beef on the roll. All and all I pulled off the meat and ate it alone throwing away the bread. Even my dogs wouldn't eat it. To hard to chew. I could have hammered a nail with the bread. For $7.29 it should have been so much better. It wasn't fresh. I think it had been sitting all day. It was 4:00 when we picked it up."}
{"text":"Chicken Pesto on French Country, combo one is fantastic. I don't understand why Kneaders has such a poor track record but I love it here.  The food always tastes fresh, the soup is awesome and the bakery is killer! We always order fresh bread to go just so we can have a snack a little later.  The service is very friendly each time we have been here but it is a TAD bit slow. I am assuming this is because they prepare each order fresh.  Not one bad experience and will continue to come back until something disastrous happens. We are here about twice a week because that's how good it is.  LOVE YOU KNEADERS *heart*"}
{"text":"I just love Kneaders! Their breakfast is amazing! My kids love the French toast! And the turkey bacon avocado on focaccia bread is just about the best thing ever!!!"}
{"text":"Kneaders just opened and I'm loving it! It's a few minutes away from home (for me) and the prices were very reasonable. We went for breakfast and had a croissant sausage sandwich, pancakes, French toast and a chocolate croissant. Everything was delicious. The wait staff was also very friendly. Kneaders is my new go to for breakfast and lunch. Yum!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try but won't be back. We went on Saturday morning and it was packed. They only had one register open which I thought was crazy. I ordered a white mocha and ended up with a regular mocha that they forgot to put the coffee into, so an expensive chocolate milk. The mint brownie I ordered was so dry and it looked like someone ran their finger over the icing on the top before I got it. When I went to the counter to get my order fixed I was told to get back in line. That would have been another 20 minutes at least. No thanks!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is always so friendly and the food is fast, not to mention yummy! I love the turkey cranberry sunflower salad and the French Toast!"}
{"text":"Very Disappointed. Got the French dip sandwich.  Nothing else came with it other than the au jus. The sandwich was edible but did not taste good."}
{"text":"First time coming in and it was about 530pm and they had absolutely nothing no soup no bread just a few deserts that's all very disappointing for my first time coming to this place. The employees had no knowledge of what was going on."}
{"text":"We've experienced way better. The online ordering was pretty easy and I was told I could go to the drive-thru for pick up. The order was ready after waiting in the line. I gave my name at the order box and said I placed an online order.Timing was perfect.When I pulled up, the young lady was trying to collect for my order that I already paid for. Then she proceeded to give me the drink intended for the person behind me. She looked confused when I reiterated  the online order.  We ordered three French Dip sandwiches. I was expecting how other restaurants serve this and that is piled high with beef served with au jus. On a baguette, there were two thin slices of deli beef and swiss cheese. Kind of 'sterile' looking for a sandwich. We may try something else next time, but that's up in the air."}
{"text":"Kneaders has great food options but the Tuna sandwich on rosemary bread is my go-to! What's neat about kneaders is that 1)they have a drive thru and 2)they serve a large variety of fresh made food. While their options are all delicious, I wish they had the same 'X' amount of soups year round. In the winter they had a ravioli soup that my bf loved but they said it was seasonal. Then we got hooked on the Irish stew which again was seasonal. Now the options that they have aren't too great. I gave for 4 stars because every time I am in the drive thru line it takes a while to get my food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh yummy breads with real ingredients...my turkey was actual turkey!! Awesome pastries! So glad this place is a little out of the way so I can't justify stopping by all the time!"}
{"text":"Panera + Cracker Barrel + Pinch of Mormon Bible = Kneaders  (For the record, I don't care WHAT your religion is, as long as your food and service is legit.  It's just present, that's all I'm saying.)  I have spent the last few months seeing this built in front of the halfway vacant plaza on Craig/95 and was glad SOMETHING was finally going in there.  I have some personal beef with the Indian Restaurant behind it, so I haven't had a reason to go near the plaza until today.    I had the Chicken Pesto Sandwich.  The bread wasn't soaked - it was crispy and the sandwich was flavorful.  Not bad.  The sides?  Potato chips and a pickle? I wish I saw where that was noted, because I eat neither and I wish I had a choice of something else.  Or I wish that the cashier told me that.  The cashier was sweet, but a lot of the staff seemed a little nervous and wet behind the ears.  My table I sat at was just cleaned and was pretty WET.  Not damp, WET.    The girl at the front said neither thank you, hello, or explained the place to me.  She just stood there, looking around.    The presentation of the place was super cute - but very something my grandmother would like - knicknacks and all sorts of things to buy with cute phrases and everything that doesn't appeal to my demographic.  However, if you have KIDS and you are looking for a place that is welcoming for that kind of thing - there were tons of kids everywhere.    I don't see myself going back as I'm a big fan of chains with more of a focus on protein.  This place is legit with their love of bread, (which was pretty good and offered free samples.)  To the owners or management - train your staff. They were not welcoming nor engaging.  You've had plenty of time. I expect better from a Mormon chain.  Look at Z***a's! They're personable and amazing!"}
{"text":"Heard good things from a colleague so wanted to try it out. I stopped in for breakfast with a buddy. The employees were friendly, place was clean and the food was great. The place had a steady flow to it and was near packed for most of the time we were there but it still remained clean and overall just a good atmosphere.    I'll be going back to try their desserts as they had a good selection and they were calling my name.....lol."}
{"text":"A great place to go for a yummy smoothie and good food!! I'm so happy I live close to this place. Great customer service as well!!"}
{"text":"I tried to like this place. I really, REALLY did. First time we all ordered salads. I ordered 5, 3 were wrong. I got a chicken bacon avocado with no avocado. Really?   It was opening week, new employees who looked fresh out of middle school. Ok. I'll give you a pass.   2 weeks later, I order the same thing. Same thing. Messed up again. I guess children have no idea how to make salads?   We ordered online both times. Both times it was a 20 minute wait past the time I said I wanted them. For SALAD.   3rd time I said screw it, let's get breakfast rolls! Hop in the car, get there 15 minutes later and cruise thru the drive through. It wasn't bad as much as it was weird. The sweet girl at the window pet my dog. (Sorry people behind me! ). Then she asked me to show her my nails. And said my hair was super pretty. I think she had a girl crush? Not sure. But I came away with 3 tarts, 2 brownies, 4 cinnamon rolls, and a coffee (I just ordered the last 2). Tarts were great. Fresh fruit. And you can't knock a freebie. Brownies were terrible. They had some awful storebought frosting on them. I can't complain too much for free brownies. The iced coffee was terrible.   Terrible. Maybe I'm a coffeehouse snob (I totally am), but this was disgusting. I asked for light ice and it was full.   Bottom line? They need to hire people above 18-20. People who give a shit about their jobs. Terrible, immature people. If this chick touched my hands and my dog, who knows what else she touched. There was zero time for her to wash from petting my dog to bringing me my baked goods. Which she no doubt touched with her hands."}
{"text":"The food here is sooooo YUMMY!!  The staff is friendly, and helpful.  I love the cute trinket items for sale and how clean the restaurant is."}
{"text":"Kneaders is so stinking delicious!!  Their baked goods are amazing, and the croissants are always so fresh and amazing to eat with a sandwich!   Also they have a cute section where you can purchase cute little home decor items or jewelry."}
{"text":"Love the food but they take forever!!!!!! I wrote this at the same time I wait here 25min and counting"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this to open! To see the food item review , scroll down. There's about 6 items we tried.  I love panera bread but it is a little out of the way for a quick lunch for me. Hubby and I tried it for the first time Friday lunch, we liked it so much we brought friends and ate dinner. We then decided to go eat there Monday. It is pricey landing you at about $10pp and you will be disappointed if you order the wring thing. He went back today for lunch but didn't ask if I wanted dessert ;/ but anywho. Service, everyone was really nice! Now anytime you have a new open, there will be hick ups as they are getting their systems down. All three times they seem to be busting their butts getting orders out in a timely manner. I love that they have crushed ice and limes on the side. Their dessert display case is amazing. I think the desserts are a TAD too sweet, but that's just my opinion, hubby likes it. The restaurant is really cute and has an adorable section to purchase aprons and books and knick knacks.  Food: turkey bacon avocado 5 star. Get this. The foccacia is thick in size but nice and airy.  Chicken cheese and ham 5 star. Super yummy. I got this cause I love ciabatta.  Chicken salad croissant 3.5 star, chicken salad was good, but needed more filling or have it spread out more evenly. French dip 2.5-3 star. Bread was delish but the amount of meat they give you is pretty pathetic. Au jus is good. Needs horseradish. Chicken artichoke panini- I didn't try it but hubby was missing his turkey bacon avocado and wished he ordered that  Broccoli cream soup-yummy! But nothing special.  Get the white choco mac cookies, and get the cinnamon bread. I can't wait to try the French Toast because they use that bread."}
{"text":"Very professional, very quick, very good food.  Thank you to the great people of kneaders"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Turkey bacon avocado sandwich out there.   When I'm in this part of town.   This is my spot."}
{"text":"Like most food in Surprise it is mediocre at best. The locals love the all you can eat French toast- where the morbidly obese come to eat   Lots of people just getting coffee.   If you have the money go to Panera right down the street.   Surprise seems to be a city where, for retirees, the quality of food does not matter. It's the price and the happy hours that drive the business"}
{"text":"I can understand whipped cream in a cream puff, but in an eclair?  Even their menu says, \"Egg flour shell with a vanilla custard filling; dipped in imported Swiss chocolate ganache. (Available weekdays from 7am to 10pm, and Saturdays from 7am to 10pm)\".  Doesn't say anything about whipped cream filling.  Total let down.  I'll drive the extra mile to AJ's where they know all about vanilla custard filling, and theirs are about twice the size.    Won't be returning.  Gonna stick with AJ's."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there to grab dinner quickly before picking up the kids.  We had been wanting to try it for quite some time, but it's always packed at lunch time.  First of all, it took forever for the 2 people working the register to get through a line which was 4 deep at the time.  My wife ordered a chicken salad sandwich, I ordered a chicken chop salad, and we got a bowl of cream of broccoli soup to share.  Again, one person running one ticket at a time, it took forever to get our food.  My salad came in a plastic to-go box, set inside of what looked like a salad bowl, with dressing on the side.  It was a garden salad, with chopped chicken the sprinkled on top, not a true chicken chop salad one would expect (if you've ever had a real, chicken chop salad).  The salad wasn't good, but I was hungry so I ate it.  Red Robin has better salads, by FAR.  My wife said her sandwich tasted like raw white onions.  I declined an invitation to verify that point.  I then picked up my spoon and dunked it in the broccoli soup, which took an extra ten minutes to get to the table because they had to \"make it fresh\".  It came and was grey in color, and tasted like, well, nothing.  Seriously, it was bland and tasteless.  Like a milky water with broccoli floaters.  Almost lost my garden salad and chopped chicken...  We did take a couple of cookies and an ooey gooey bar to go.  I took one bite of the bar and it was marginal.  Overall this place is awful.  Save money and get better food at Paradise Bakery.  You know you will get a good meal there.  I gave it two stars because the cookies were enjoyed by the kiddos.  Other than that, I'm not sure how this place has exploded the way it has.  It's like Old Country Buffet, but without the Buffet."}
{"text":"Food was good but way over priced. $9 and change for a club sandwich. Didn't get drink or sides. It would have cost more than a good sit down meal. If your rich you should eat here. For the rest of us go to Capriottis  You will be much happier."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Clearly soars high above over the chain bakery a few establishments over. The french toast was out of this world. It was love at first bite. Not to mention it is ALL YOU CAN EAT! The service was fast and they were very attentive. Even the owners were getting down and dirty, cleaning, serving and working hard to make sure everything and everybody were taken care of! Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and although I want to love it, I just dont. I dont love it. The service is so slow. The food is hot & generally good but it takes for-ev-er to arrive. Thus, a 3 star rating from this hangry girl."}
{"text":"I have tried Kneaders in Utah and was happy to see it here in AZ. They do not disappoint in the bakery dept, so much to choose from and very high quality. Their rolls and bread are great to go for Sunday dinner."}
{"text":"First time going here day before mothers day, love the decor inside and food tastes fresh! Will definetely be back"}
{"text":"Had croissant and chocolate croissant. I went at 7 but doesn't taste like fresh baked. Hope I can have fresh one next time!"}
{"text":"Best carrot cake in town! Order one for two persons!! Real ingredients must be used as it was as good as my Momas!"}
{"text":"I loveeeeeeeee this place! Ethan the night manager is amazing and always provides my fiancé and I a wonderful experience. Not to mention I haven't had one bad dessert here. Love it, love it, love it!!!"}
{"text":"Not very pleased with the experience I had in the drive through today. Carson was VERY rude. After putting chicken on a Salad for a vegetarian she fought me and told me there was not chicken on it even though it was very evident. I took a bite not being a vegetarian myself I took a bite and sure enough it was chicken. Once I explained that this salad was for a vegetarian she rolled her eyes and took it back making sure to let me know it would take a awhile. After all that they still got our order wrong but it wasn't major so I let it go. When she brought back the salad she looked very annoyed and told me \"next time make sure you go inside rather than come through the drive through\" I will make sure my patients and friends know not to go to kneaders unless they want an unpleasant time. Not going back!"}
{"text":"I've had everything but the soup here, and I am always amazed.  My favorite thing to order here is the sourdough pancakes... and I am never disappointed. #lfthx"}
{"text":"My sister and I just had a delightful experience at this location. This was our first visit to Kneaders, and we were impressed the moment we walked in. We loved the decor for sale, the pastries and treats that were displayed, the charity station, and how bright and welcoming the ambiance of the room made us feel. It's easy to compare their menu to Panera, or Wildflower, the difference is that Kneader's prices were slightly more reasonable, with comparable food quality. Our server, Kelly was the best part of our breakfast. Very hospitable, relatable and an easy conversationalist! She mentioned the all you can eat French toast EVERDAY, which I decided to try out. I'm not a fan of French toast, I don't know why I chose this option honestly. But I don't regret anything because it was SO GOOD. So good, with a plop of whipped cream and strawberries! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I walked in around 9pm hoping to get some goodies for the kid's, bakery was empty, one employee was cleaning the tables, I waited in the cashier area for about 5 mins, no one came to serve me, looked around, no one came to help, walked around again checked menu for 2nd time, still no one was present at service area, waited little longer, again no one to be seen in the horizon, the cleaning employee continue to do her job, I was buzzed and confused, why? finally gave up and started walking towards the exit hoping someone would attempt to stop me from behind with \"can I help you?\" question, nope didn't happen (only in my head), I continued to walk out of the store. I can't comment on food bcs I never got to taste it!.......I did get better luck at nearby wholefood...don't believe me? check your cameras!"}
{"text":"We have liked this place since they opened. We have eaten in and used the drive thru . Food is always good and orders are correct. I dropped a star though because the last few times I ordered the French toast it wasn't hot or fresh. I'm sure they make up a big batch and let it sit in a warmer. But they should make them as ordered."}
{"text":"Sandwiches looked great, but were over priced and found a long hair in one of them.  The person at the drivethru was rude and never said a word.  Bad first experience"}
{"text":"I had a bad feeling from when I walked in the door and saw that they were selling a $1500 Christmas tree.  Seriously? Are they expecting Bill Gates to walk in and be like, \"Hey, I could really go for a reuben...and a Christmas tree.\" People don't go to a bakery to buy Christmas trees, just like they don't go to Home Depot for fine cuisine. Ridiculous.  Anyways, on to the food. I've been there twice now and not impressed. The bread and cookies and desserts are good, but that's about it. Don't come here if you're hungry. I've never seen such a sad, paltry amount of meat on a sandwich in my life. There was literally a quarter inch on the sandwich. Maybe they're practicing rationing in expectation of the upcoming food shortage due to Ebola or something. We've had 4 sandwiches on 2 different days and they were all the same amount. My wife had the French dip and it was simply the Great Depression size serving of beef and a piece of cheese between bread.  Very underwhelming. We also tried the soup which was bland and definitely from a bag or can. Not homemade.  For $8 a sandwich, there better be some meat on it. This place simply doesn't cut it and the crowds will die down once people experience this.  If you're an anorexic hipster, this place is straight up your alley, however, if you're a normal human being who likes good value and amazing fresh made food, skip this place and go to Archie's deli instead. I guarantee you won't be disappointed and it's right down the street."}
{"text":"Tried it twice. First visit tried a salad which was just a huge bowl of greens with hardly any meat or other adds. Second visit, I tried a sandwich which was dry and tasteless. It didn't even come with chips or a pickle!  The place is very noisy and you can hardly even hear when the server comes round yelling out your name! The place has no class. The food is ordinary and pricy. They are closed Sunday's.  I won't be returning......."}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches, however there is no table service, which makes it impossible for the handicapped such as myself. I cannot stand in line, order, sit and they bring it to you. We had to get back in the vehicle and go through the drive-thru, which we didn't want to do. Won't be going back, because:  1) The food was cold by the time we got back home. 2) We don't eat in the car. Would have been good other than that. NOT handicap accessible!"}
{"text":"Love kneaders. This location,  not so much. They never have anything. Last 2 times they were out of sourdough bread, and the cinnamon loaf. The French dip was hard as stone. I could have seriously thrown it at a window and shattered it. They need to step up their game. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Decided to try kneaders today for the first and last time. I ordered the chicken pesto panini  cuz the description (grilled chicken breast, fresh pesto butter, provolone cheese, fresh basil, tomatoes, red onions, salt and pepper on french country sourdough, served hot with parmesan chips and a pickle) made the sandwich sound appetizing right? WRONG! The  description should have said the following flattened elongated ,via clothes roller to fit the larged panini bread,dried out chicken breast , nickel sized dollip of pesto butter on each half of a large sandwich, oily transparent provolone cheese, 2 half dollar sized pieces of melee tomatoes again one for each half of a large sandwich, an unidentifiable skinny shriveled up green thing we'll call basil I guess, 2 pieces of oversized dental floss we'll call red onion, salt and pepper on can't even bite through crusted french country sourdough. That was a more factual description, upon ordering my $9 dollar sandwich I asked for an extra pickle spear to which I get the response that will be a .25 cent up charge I thought really I'm already paying $9 for the sandwich u can't just give me one but ok. So I get home unpack everything pulled a little tiny brown pouch out, that I thought might contain a couple condiment packets, nope it was my 50 calorie serving of stale parmesan chips. Went to take my first bite after a few seconds of tugging n pulling I finally got through the incredibly tough almost rubber like crust. I noticed out of the corner of my eye my wife staring at me through the process I must have looked like a lion tuning up a gazelle. Oh well gave it a shot would have been better off with a lunchable I wouldn't have a sore jaw n i would have saved $6."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Went on Friday and purchased four desserts to bring home. They were lackluster.  They all tasted the same. Nothing special. It's as if you bought them from the Vons Bakery.  Mass market food with no passion. No flavor.   Just went to buy a nice crusty loaf of bread. Same result.   I pass and will not go there again. Food is much better at CRAFTkitchen, just down the street."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience!!! I asked for a recommendation and Ethan recommended the French Dip. I must say Ethans recommendations was exactly what I wanted and needed after not eating all day.  My order was complete moments after sitting sitting down. The sandwich was Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"So far so good. Got the seafood roll and have to say, nom nom nom. Tasted awesome. Broc & Cheese soup tasted great."}
{"text":"If you haven't had Kneaders french toast, you need to RUN right now and get it. The syrup that comes with it is so good, the slices are big and thick...so yummy! I've tried a few different sandwiches during lunch and they are good (but maybe not amazing). I've had sandwiches that are perfectly prepared and some that are a bit more sloppy/skimpy. But their baked goods are my favorite. Definitely worth a trip to get some of their breads!"}
{"text":"The food was just...okay; the highlight was the French dip; quite good except I found the bread a bit too thick; the key lime tart and the chocolate mousse was just not good.  Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Oh M G!  I am in love! Been here 4 times in 10 days. Famous tuna is delicious. Have had turkey sandwich, tortilla soup and tomato bisque. Ordering online is easy. I need to try the French toast that is all the rave. And the bread well, that's what it's all about! Get your butt there soon!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place for the first time and so glad I did. I ordered avocado chicken bacon salads and a quart of Irish stew both were delicious. The dessert selection is great and everything we have tried has been yummy!! So glad this place opened in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Just catered from here for a baby shower, and everything was perfect! We loved it, and it came fresh and on-time! We got sandwiches, salad, and soup, and will definitely cater from here for now on!"}
{"text":"came here after seeing that paradise bakery down the st was closed. never had the chance to try anything but their breakfast menu before so was willing to give it a try. my boyfriend got a 1/2 turkey sandwich 1/2 salad combo, & i got a 1/2 muenster melt with a 1/2 cheddar broccoli soup. wasn't too impressed with the sandwiches, didn't have anything unique about them. the soup was the most appetizing part of our meals, and would probably be the reason i return to this location."}
{"text":"I really like this place to pick up a quick bite. I usually get the combo 3 with the provolone cheese melt. I love a good grilled cheese and this one hits the spot. The service is always fast and friendly. The server also made sure that I signed up for the frequent diner card to get points. If you get a certain points you can use it to save on your next purchase. The manager even put in a couple of new loaves of bread they are selling. I will be bringing them to work and telling them about this place. It is a real class act in service and goods."}
{"text":"I love Kneaders. I personally LOVE their French Toast.... and all their other goodness (sweets) don't help too. Go here! So GOOD!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst restaurants in Phoenix. from Gum popping, over make-uped girls, terrible service, a manger that could not care more. And \"Yes\" a $1500.00 Christmas tree. This restaurant is the perfect example of all show and no go. But in this case no substance what so ever. Now to continue the negitives......Small portions of meat on huge pieces of bread, empty containers, employees not having a clue what they are doing, and the soups have huge chunks of veggies.....My wife and I have been there twice and there will never be a 3rd. Also if they continue to continue to give bad service in this area. The adult community folks will spread the word and they will have cob webs growing with in a year.........One last few rants!! The ONLY saving grace are the parties which are really good. But the rest is just a mess and they should close this store until they get their stuff together....If you are looking for a great sandwich, soups and anything else. Paradise bakery just down the street does it right. And for even bigger and OUTSTANDING sandwiches with LOTS of meat head a little farther east to Archie's. Now before anyone gets all mad...I am NOT an ex employee or employee of any of these restaurants but my family and I know what we like and its NOT Kneaders...."}
{"text":"The Goods 1. Did you know, all you can eat french toast (fluffy and delish) until breakfast end 11am 2. Lots of breads and Pastries  3. Salads and good selections of daily soups   Service  1. Can be a little slower side but maybe it's just today. 2. Friendly and lots of smiles I love it  3. Do a loyalty card   Ambiance  1. Rustic, spacious  2. Serve yourself drinks  3. CC accepted  4. Public restrooms   MoJo 1. Recommended the french toast and glad I went for it  2. Breads are so chewy and have a great bite"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place after we were done exercising. He told me I just had to get the French Toast. Walking in it feels like you walked into someone's home where they are making you food. The decor was nice and it went well with the home theme. They have a large variety of bakery items and coffee. The menu was straightforward and easy to understand. I ended up getting the French Toast and it did not disappoint. They give you whip-cream and sliced strawberries with it. I couldn't believe how fast they got the food out to us. Must had just finished a fresh batch. The food was great!  The bakery is in the shopping center and there is tons of parking. They have a drive threw as well.  I would definitely recommend people try it out. They definitely deliver some pretty good food."}
{"text":"Stopped by Kneader's a few weeks ago on the way home to grab a pastry, and was pleasantly surprised. We liked that they were open a little later (10pm).  Tonight we showed up at 9:05 to a sign on the door that said their lobby closed now closed at 9pm. Fine, we got in the car and figured we would go around through the drive-thru. Wanting pastries, we were a little disappointed to see the drive-thru menu with little options. Individual items were not listed so you had to really know what you wanted.  After asking some questions and finding out our first, second, and third options were all sold out, I made a quick comment that \"Maybe I should take this as a sign I shouldn't get dessert.\" The gentleman's response, \"Yeah, maybe you should.\"  No good options and a rude response... With that we decided to leave."}
{"text":"After a good morning working outside, I decided to stop by Kneaders because I wanted a salad and I wanted it to go. I got the Turkey Bacon Salad and it was amazing. Lots of flavor and everything mixed well. It all tasted fresh and turkey was even better. It was just what I needed, it came with a choice of bread on the side, so I opted in for the asiago sourdough per recommendation from the lady taking my order. Again another awesome choice, evidently fresh baked and light."}
{"text":"Wonderful bakery.  Becoming a favorite breakfast place with locals. Wish they had some vegan entree options.  The gift shop has seasonal offerings and it's a nice place to shop for small gifts.  You can have your dog on their outdoor patio with you while you eat which is a plus. And you get a great view of Oro Valley's beautiful Catalina's."}
{"text":"Dirty dirty dirty.  I was there at 2:30 which should be a slower time for most places. There was food crumbs all over. Not a clean booth in sight. Three employees sitting at a table on a break I would assume which just looks bad given how dirty the place was. Average food. The brownie and sugar cookie was good so I went back to get some to go. I was ignored at the counter. Three employees walked by me and no one acknowledged my presence!  Won't be back.  Must be poorly managed!!"}
{"text":"Went there this morning with my wife to grab a quick breakfast... major letdown- menu sucks & everything that sounds workable has a pork product of some kind in it. To top off the poor first impression of the restaurant, no one- not even the floor manager- greeted us when we went in... not even a \"Hi, we'll be right with you!\" Seriously, people? If you treat your customers with such disregard, what can we expect from your kitchen and food handling? Not going to go back there for anything... too bad, because we were kinda stoked to see a bakery/restaurant being built a few months back & had high hopes for it being a great place to grab a bite. Paradise Bakery is just down the street so we'll stick with what's been good."}
{"text":"I got the ham, egg and cheese croissant and it was amazing. It was cooked perfectly with no extra grease. I was very impressed when the sandwich stayed together and did not fall apart like most breakfast cafes. You can see the quality in he food and definitely taste it as well. My boyfriend got the chunky French toast and it was prefect. They also provided a bowl of water for our dog out on the patio where we enjoyed breakfast!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner one evening. Long story short, nice-ish place, but fairly mediocre food. It's edible, but not very enjoyably so. Also, they use a boring whipped cream in their eclairs and tarts. Not very tasty.  So, you'll get okay food and maybe slightly high, but generally okay prices."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for a bite to eat on our way to Prescott. I will keep this short and to the point. No one opened the drive through window to greet us for at least 7-10 minutes. The the croissant wasn't  cut right so one half of the sandwich didn't have bread on the top. Hardly any meat on the sandwiches. Last but not least, we also ordered smoothies and they were so chunky you couldn't eat all of it through the straw.  I have eaten at the Kneaders in Avondale several times and never had a bad experience like this one."}
{"text":"I wanted bread and panara was a little to far for dinner. I decided to check out this place and asked the cashier if she had Sour Dough. She said yes and I paid. It took about 10 minutes to get my bread sliced and bagged. I noticed my recipe said French Bread when we got to the car but I figured she hit the wrong button. When I arrive home and opened the bread I noticed she gave me the complete wrong bread. I don't mind French bread but that isn't what I ordered. When I order 1 item I expect it to be correct. Very disappointed and probably won't ever be back. Plus their prices are very high I will make the trip to another bakery."}
{"text":"Great new place every neighborhood wishes they had. Love the fresh bread. I had the club turkey, ham and beef sandwich, salad and chocolate dome. They make everything fresh, but the extra wait is worth it."}
{"text":"It was really busy when I went in but things still ran smoothly. The food is good quality and fresh."}
{"text":"Overall very good.   I've been a few times now (2 drive through,  1 dined in)  and the food has been tasty.   I've only gone with the salads and I've enjoyed them all.   Get them with the side of bread as all their breads are very good.   The baked goods and desserts are amazing.   My main selling point: it has a drive through.   My Greek Corner was my go to place for to go food that wasn't fast food.   This place is a good replacement.     Now that they have been open a few weeks,  the service has smoothed out and the lines are shorter.   I will admit that the Xmas trees in early October is just weird."}
{"text":"Sooo disappointed in this place. I heard it was similar to Pandera but it is far from! The first time I went, I asked for a menu and they couldn't find any. I checked online and their site only partially works, so I went through their drive thru and the girl taking orders was listening challenged. I had to repeat my order several times before she finally got it. I still though I should give them another try so I went again today and asked if they could make me a whole pb&j sandwich. I know that they have a half one on their kids menu so it wasn't like I was asking for something special. I said that I would pay extra for it and they said no, they couldn't do that. Really?! Wow! I won't be back."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Kneaders and I doubt I will come back. Went at dinner time on a week day with my wife and daughter. They were out of the soup I wanted to try. They messed up my order and didn't even make my sandwich. I had to re-order. $10 for a Reuben sandwich is ridiculous. Only had two very thin slices of meat. A tiny cup of soup and regular drink was an extra $3.00. The food was good but not worth the money. Spent over $35.00 on three people. Could have gone to a sit down restaurant for that. I hardly ever express my views on places I eat, but they are really proud of their food."}
{"text":"The last three times we've visited kneaders we have had bad experiences. Ordered online at 10:40 for order to be picked up/ready at 11:30. At 11:50y husband was still waiting for it. When he asked management what happened he was given attitude and told they were short staffed. No apology at all. Terrible customer service. Very unfortunate"}
{"text":"I  Kneaders! It's similar to Paradise or Panera honestly but the servings are much larger for a similar price. When you walk in you get hit instantly with the appetizing aroma or cookies & cakes. I usually opt for soup & sandwich w/ dessert & am never disappointed. The staff are friendly & the food comes out quickly. I've never used the drive through but there's always a line & a line can easily form in the lobby if you go @ the peak times. Overall for the price it's better quality & quantity over nearby competitors."}
{"text":"Have liked this place since we first heard about it when we're were in Snowbird several years ago.  We have tried different sandwiches but keep going back to the classic turkey on asiago cheese.  Also recommend either the chocolate covered brownie or the chocolate dome cake.  My only beef with them is that know matter what store you go to they service is extremely slow whether you are the only person at the counter or there is a line, they are in absolutely no hurry and in most cases several people employees are walking around but only one person taking orders...definitely need a review of there training or processes.  I will continue to go there because I like there food but it does get frustrating at times waiting to order...and no I don't do drive through or order online no happening."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, I come here for breakfast mainly, the wait is a bit long but your getting what your waiting for, homemade quality food, it's always fresh and the environment is nice, super kind people working there, drive thru is usually a quicker route if you are in a hurry. Ultimately I will be returning frequently."}
{"text":"Love Kneaders! The chicken and rice soup is amazing. Sandwiches are huge. I always get a loaf of bread when I swing by. Has a drive thru so that's convenient; however, it is a slow line so don't go if you're in a rush. Everything is on the pricey side but I always return."}
{"text":"Wonderful Reuben and chicken salad!  Bread is awesome!  Service was great.  We'll be back for SURE.  Please let me know when you get rewards cards."}
{"text":"Delicious, convenient, and quick! Delicious breakfast croissants (the cheese was nice and gooey!), and several healthy, customizable options. Salads are simple but good, as is the soup. It's great to have a healthy drive-thru option when fried food just isn't cutting it. I'll be back to try the baked goods, too!"}
{"text":"We made it in time for breakfast at 10:15, ordered french toast and was looking forward to ordering some more at 10:45. They took our plates away and made us aware that they'll bring us our second helping a french toast. 11 rolled around, still no French toast and we asked for it again. 11:15 rolled around, we had to go up to the front and ask for it again and we were made aware that they haven't even started to make it yet even though we asked for it a half an hour prior. Matt's excuse was\" sorry we are so busy\" with only one couple in line. Needless to say we are so disappointed we wasted half an hour on nothing and walked away frustrated. The food that we received was delicious but the service was terrible. It put a bad taste in my mouth and I don't know if we'll go back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Update to my last review- We came back with the kids and some friends. Lots of comments from other customers while in line about the menu being pricey. When we got our food though-DELICIOUS and large portions! Staff was much more friendly second time around. We will be back often because it's so close to the office!"}
{"text":"I waited over 45 min for a tuna sandwich and a bowl of soup. I was sick of waiting so I asked for a refund and left. Many other parties encountered the same thing. I won't go back until they get it together."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the food is really good. The service is also very decent. Portions are big enough for a man to eat, and they also have half sizes for smaller people. The pastries are all really good. And the soup is divine."}
{"text":"I've always highly recommended Kneaders breakfast to everyone I know. But moms- listen up! Healthy, quick, DRIVE THROUGH lunch for the win today! I had the turkey bacon avocado sandwich and it was delicious. You'll be hooked."}
{"text":"All I can say is where's the beef ordered a Rueben and could not believe how little meat was on it the rye bread was good but that's it! My wife's sandwich was no better, won't be going back unless I want a bread only sandwich! And prices are no bargain for for what you get!"}
{"text":"I've had multiple experiences here at this locations that's prompted me to write a review. All of the staff is ALWAYS friendly and happy. It's such a great environment to eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner in. The food is always prepared correctly. The dining area is clean, bathrooms clean.   When I've gone through the drive though they make sure to have everything I ordered in the bags - there's never anything missing!   And on top of all of that, the food is super yummy!   Love Kneaders and love this location even more!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the service very average at best. Told the guy there was no coffee and he should not sense of anything but they brought the coffee out a few mins later. They brought my sandwich on a croissant I told the lady put it on a sourdough and it felt like she also had an attitude.   Food portion was small with NO sides. I won't be back but this place might be good for some people just not me."}
{"text":"The 2 times I went here I couldn't believe how amazing my sand which was that I had ordered. It was so tasty that I decided to go back again a few days later. I had gotten the BLT, it was out of this world and very fresh. If you order it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"If there was zero stars! I would put it! I had the worse experience here two times giving them a second chance on their service which failed. The service is very SLOW! You wait forever to receive your food. You also receive your latte without your dessert that you ordered then waiting another 10 mins and then ur latte is cold. Without customer service the employees will never have a paycheck! Food does not take this long to service at all! Please go to another place and save yourself the headache in coming here!!!!"}
{"text":"They just don't have it together! Service is slow (18 minutes to just box cookies when nobody else was in line or at the drive-thru), orders are wrong and quality is meh... equal to a Panera. You will pay $3/ cookie that taste more like flour than it's supposed flavor. If you need fast food, you are better off landing at Subway!"}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time today and got the club sandwich!! OMG.... I'm off the best Sandwiches I have ever had!! And the place looks and smells delicious!! Staff was so nice live that they being your food to you!!! Can't wait to go back for desserts and more yummy food!!"}
{"text":"Becoming a family favorite!!! Great sandwiches, soups, and suuuuuuuper soft bread. Kiddos love the cinnamon rolls. Highly recommend the chicken bacon avocado sandwich!"}
{"text":"I bought 4 items from kneaders on my first visit.  I got a cannoli, a lime tart, a petite carrot cake and a raspberry petite cake. Each dessert was delicious in its own way. They have a great variety of foods and drinks for everyone . Everything looks so amazing I just want to eat it all. Might update the review as well after I try their bread.     If you going during lunch time done be surprised if it's packed, this place is that good. Take your order to go if you don't like lines."}
{"text":"This restaurant has amazing sandwiches, wide varieties of soups and breads, and a dessert selection that will never let you down.  Their rewards card is very reasonable and doesn't take much to earn credits toward future meals.  I recommend the chicken and ham sandwich, and their key lime tarts.  Amazing!  My better half lives their cinnamon buns. I have yet to try anything at Kneaders that isn't top notch.  The only thing that held them back from 5 stars, although they have gotten better, is you MUST check your order before leaving.  Many times I have not been given everything or something is incorrect.  The staff is extremely polite and more than willing to make things right, but hopefully catch the mistake before leaving.  The managers and employees are extremely friendly and exactly how restaurants should be.  Would recommend to anyone and I frequent their Signal Butte location frequently.  Try their desserts!!  Oh timeliness definitely is not the strong suit, but a reviewer mentioned there was no silverware.  The silverware had always been by the fountain drink machine.  She probably didn't see it."}
{"text":"Great quality for the price.  I love that the turkey in the turkey sandwiches isn't crappy processed meat, it's real turkey.  Yummy soups and the bakery treats are to die for!  A great alternative to other soup and sandwich chains."}
{"text":"This establishment is a very good alternative to Panara's Bread or Paradise Bakery. The \"Club\" sandwich entry is excellent and as tasty a flavor meld as any I've experimented with in years (yum)!!!  The soups are rich and hearty ( hello cooler weather!!!). Bakery deserts are this store's signature item, muffin top or bread pudding, oh my scrumptious. Homemade breads??? Ummm ummm good"}
{"text":"Desserts are great here. The cheese cake is one of the best in east mesa. The service is always friendly and they have a drive thru if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Did NOT like this place I got half a salad and half sandwich and the food just tasted generic, fake! I feel like we have so many better options for sandwiches, soups and salad... Wildflower, Panera and Cafe Zupas taste WAYYYYY better then this place!"}
{"text":"Best croissants in the area! I Love their selection of pastries, good filling breakfast foods and that they are all healthier options!"}
{"text":"Came here to hangout with my friends during lunch time.   They have soups, coffees, breakfast, sandwiches, smoothies, salads, & desserts. I got the broccoli cheese soup & a sandwich. I got the classic cafe sandwich ham. It was real good basically like a homemade sandwich."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good at this place, but my frustration is with the service, specifically the drive-thru. Twice recently I've ordered sandwiches and specifically asked for \"no onion\" and they've still put onion on the sandwich. Also, today, I ordered a pastry, which they just put in the large bag as a loose item without any other packaging around it, so the icing smeared all over the other items in the bag. It's just poor customer service which diminishes the fresh, tasty food products they produce."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Kneaders locations, it this location was just, eh.   I came in on a weekday later morning, and it wasn't very busy, but it took a really long time before I got to put my order. The tables weren't very clean, but the staff was very friendly. I got a smoothie and muffin top. I was disappointed by the muffin top because it didn't have a lot of blueberries in it and was very dry. The smoothie was really good, but a little disappointing that the employee taking my order did not know what was in any of the smoothie drinks.  There is a drive-thru option, if you don't want to get out of your vehicle, but I'm not sure how long the wait will be. There is definitely room for improvement for this location, and I'm hoping that it will be for the better."}
{"text":"I had breakfast at a Kneaders outside of Salt Lake City a couple of years ago - it was a cold and snowy morning, and we had time to grab a bite on the way to our meeting.  I ordered the french toast and coffee at the cashier's suggestion - it was AMAZING.  Been wanting to take my daughter there ever since - she loves french toast.  Great news - Kneaders opened near our neighborhood!!!  We went for dinner a few nights ago - I was crushed...CRUSHED...that the french toast was only available from 7-11 a.m.  I got a reuben, my daughter got the french dip.  Good sandwiches!  We got some bakery items to take home - also very good (try the asiago cheese bread!!!).  So, finally...this morning...I got up early so we could get the French Toast.  We arrived.  The beautiful cashier smiled and welcomed us and asked what we wanted. \"French toast, please...and coffee for me, and french toast and water for the young lady.\"  So, was it as good as I remembered, or did the sleepy/cold/snowy/been up since 4 a.m. and hungry and needing coffee put a mystical glow on my memory?  Yes!  The french toast is wonderful (and, all you can eat!  3 slices if you get it to go) - it is made with their chunky cinnamon bread, and served with fresh whipped cream (thick - almost like whipped butter), strawberry slices, and caramel syrup.  OMG...wonderful!!!  My daughter agreed that I was not suffering from some sort false memory covering for the misery of that long-ago business trip - it was really THAT good.  And, for you dads out there, the Saturday before Father's Day is 'Dads Eat Free' french toast day!  (Just don't get up too early - I don't want the line to be too long when we get there.)  Lovin' it!!!"}
{"text":"Long lines. No gluten free on the menu. Otherwise the food smells good. It made me very hungry as I stood and waited to order. Good place for impulse buyers of the merchandise on display in line."}
{"text":"In short:   Positive: Service  Pastries Coffee   Atmosphere   Negative: Didn't warm up pastries, had to ask twice       Pretty decent place. I love the decorations! The pastries are good, I had the cinnamon roll and German chocolate bread pudding and they were amazing! Cafe mocha is pretty good, better than expected. The only issue I had was that I asked for the pasties to be warmed up and they weren't. I ordered them separately so I had to ask for each of them warmed up separately, twice.  Other than that, exceptional service, amazing pastries, good coffee!"}
{"text":"Love this place, took my kids to Breakfast with Santa and had so much fun. Super clean, very nicely decorated, food was delicious, and Santa was great. My kids had no desire to sit with him and he just worked super hard and becoming their friends, my youngest gave a high five(That is it), my middle child was playing with him by the end and my oldest had zero reservations. ON top of that the staff was caroling and playing guitar, and dressed up as santas helpers. Have been in on other days and always busy, it is not \"fast food\" so there is a wait but food is always warm and good. Staff super friendly and love that they are cleaning tables and offering to clear tables of empty plates!"}
{"text":"So excited to try out this new place, close to home. The place is beautiful inside and out, it makes you want to stop by anytime for anything. I went it for a soup because my daughter was coming down with a flu and I thought a soup would help. Of course I couldn't leave without trying some pastries especially with their deal of buy 5 get 1 free. Now on to my experience my order was wrong and I didn't notice until I got home. They gave me the wrong soup and my daughter had her heart set on the chipotle but instead we got the cauliflower cheese soup, it was good but it sucks when your looking fwd to something and get something else. So for pastries I ordered 3 cannolis (mine and my son's favorite) we were so disappointed because the shell was soft and the flavor was not the best. We hate cannolis with soft shells. On the other hand I also ordered some pumpkin muffins, a cream cheese filled croissant which were very good. So just be patient while this place gets the customer service in order and make sure you double check your order.."}
{"text":"I met a friend at Kneaders for coffee. I not only had delicious cofee but a delicious pastry as well.  This location is immaculate with pleasant counter service.  They serve breakfast and lunch dishes.  All of their baked goods are made on site.  The selection of artisan breads is impressive and mouth watering to look at.  Kneaders has an adorable gift center with one of a kind items wrapped creatively and festively.   I will go back when I need a unique gift.   Also, I am a 1950s music fan.  The music overhead was right up my alley !!"}
{"text":"Patty is the best manager of Kneaders.She is very accomodating, resourceful and will go extra mile just to help her customers.  Keep up the great work Patty, u da best! Thanks for everything!"}
{"text":"I've only recently discovered Kneaders for lunch and it was delicious! I somehow walked by the pastries (I'm still amazed that I was able to) but managed to grab a sample of a cherry pastry next to the cashier :) I ordered their Turkey Avocado on sourdough .... mmmmmmm.  They certainly don't skimp on portions so their half sandwich is definitely enough for me!"}
{"text":"The drive-thru is efficient & I have yet to dine inside. I ordered the blueberry muffin top & cinnamon roll bc I have a sweet tooth. Next time I'll definitely try something on the lunch menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is careless when preparing ones order.  How difficult is it to make a turkey bacon avocado salad?  TWICE now I have ordered this salad drive thru so I don't check before driving away and each time it hasn't had avocado.  I called and Steve the \"owner\" didn't sound apologetic at all.  I won't return here I would rather go to Panera anyways."}
{"text":"Nothing remarkable here, a typical croissant with an egg, cheese, and a couple of barely cooked pieces of bacon, left me unimpressed."}
{"text":"Definitely a good place to have lunch.  Recommend the Cafe Sandwishes, it comes in whole or half with a choice of breads.  We had a Ham & Cheese on Sour Dough and a Pastrami on white.  We added the combo #1 which came with a choice of soup/salad and Soda."}
{"text":"Kneaders is definitely over priced. I simple sandwich comes with no side (such as chips) and is $7 plus! The filling (chicken salad) is meek to say the least. A lot of times they have been out of items (such as ice, and bread type). Parking is VERY difficult at this location, especially at lunch time hours."}
{"text":"i absolutely love this place. Ive come here on multiple occassions and Ive ordered their french dip, two different paninis, their turley avocado sandwich, their potato soup, two different tarts, mango smoothie, and german chocolate brownie. EVERYTHING has been delicious, considering im currently 9 months pregnant thats amazing to me that nothing made me want to barf. The customer service is pretty decent and the establishment is pretty clean. This place is definitely worth spending money at."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check this place out since they opened and we finally made it by for lunch today. I had never been to a Kneaders so I was surprised by the display of knick knacks you can buy including a make your own basket section so you can out together a gift with some of the items they sell or some of their baked goods. I was surprised at the amount of baked goods they had. I will definitely be back to try some of them another time as they looked yummy. They had some super cute frosted sugar cookies that are shaped like bees that I want to try.  I ordered the turkey cranberry croissant which came with a small salad. My son had the half chicken Caesar salad and my husband had the full chicken berry salad. I didn't try the berry salad but my sons Caesar was pretty good and a large serving for just a half size. I enjoyed my sandwich. The croissant was delicious and the cranberry sauce added a perfect touch of sweetness. Two salads, a sandwich and 3 sodas cost just under $30.00. The service was just ok...they definitely need to pick up the pace in there and the person bringing the food to the tables needs to speak up as it was hard to hear him call my name among the other patrons eating lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Kneaders and I was definitely impressed by both the food and level of service. The girls who took my order and brought our food out to us were very friendly and accommodating. I got the Turkey, Bacon, Avocado on Focaccia and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. The bread was delicious and the turkey breast used was great quality. I also got a side of their Chicken and Wild Rice soup which was the stand out for me, sooo good! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not looking for this place!   Glad I found it! This place made me really happy!  Looks like there are more food places that are moving onto this strip mall!"}
{"text":"So sad that this place has really gone downhill.  The desserts taste OLD and FROZEN! Cheesecake is GROSS! Also, I went through the drive through and my order was incorrect. Came back and politely told the guy, he was so rude and gave me attitude and acted like I messed up the order! The service and food used to be amazing and the last several times, has not even been edible. I will not be coming back again- too bad bc I can literally walk here from my house!"}
{"text":"I am so frustrated with the lack of having soup at your restaurant! Last night  a friend picked up food for us. Two soups they were out of and then he got to the window to find the third soup out. We ordered the cheese sandwiches and they looked like they were not grilled as nice as they usually are. Terrible food presentation and terrible grumpy service. They were on speaker phone as our friend ordered for us. Sore kneaders you are off my list!!!! This is not the first time with soup issues. I stopped by last week around two. They were out of the soup I ordered. So I got something different. After we got our food the next customer ordered the same soup I wanted and they had fresh made! Seriously I would have waited for soup. Kneaders crappy service and lousy presentation...sad I gotta go somewhere else. I need recommendations for good soup!"}
{"text":"They've recently opened and are swamped, I need to qualify this review based on that. First, the quality of everything was good but there were understandable errors. I had the turkey avocado. I changed the bread from focaccia to 12 grain and asked for no onions. My sandwich was missing avocado but had onions on half. They gladly fixed it and it was great. The broccoli soup was very good. My husband had the chicken salad sandwich. He was very disappointed that there was very little chicken (three pieces) with lots of water chestnuts. The manager (I think) was the one who corrected. When he brought my sandwich back he asked my husband how his was. When he heard about the small amount of chicken he apologized and said it sounded like it wasn't mixed well. He offered to correct or bring a dessert. We declined but appreciated his genuine concern. Because of his attitude, we moved it from two stars to three. If those issues hadn't been there 4-5. We will be back to try again as what we had was tasty and we understand they just opened and were swamped."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try out Kneaders after a friend suggested their French Toast.  Well honestly it was mostly my husbands desire. I am not in to the sweeter things for breakfast but we had Saturday shopping to do and he was getting hangry. Anyways,  it was very busy when we got there  I just didn't see anything that I wanted until I saw the raspberry cream cheese pastry. I wasn't sure as again I am not big into sweets but I decided to try it. I was so glad I did, the pastry was light and flaky and the raspberry jam  was absolutely amazing. My husband got Strawberry French Toast and loved it as well.  Definitely would go back again. It is very busy so patience is key."}
{"text":"As this was the first time here, I was a bit confused when walking in.  I was expecting someone to greet me and explain how to order.  Yes, they have a wonderful pastry case with a large selection of sweets.  I was meeting friends for breakfast.  My partner and I ordered the egg and cheese sandwich on a croissant.  The order was delivered quickly to our table.  Unfortunately, the quality of the sandwich was not much better than what you get from Circle K.  It was reasonably priced; both of our croissants were $12.  Would I go back again for breakfast, probably not."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst kneaders locations. They have gotten my order wrong on MORE than one occasion. This last time was the last straw for me, I ordered a big order for my office, called ahead and placed the order an hour ahead of time of me getting there. Waited in line, paid and waited and waited and waited. Finally I had to ask the girl at the cash register if my order was ready, told her I called it in an hour ago. \"Oh! Let me check\" come to find out, they lost the order, no apology, just her telling me, oh they're making it now. Uhh...what's the point of call ahead if you're going to make it when I get there?!? Terrible!!!!! So mad, done with this place!"}
{"text":"I stopped in tonight for dinner and enjoyed my experience.  The staff was very welcoming and immediately took my order.  I had the turkey and artichoke on focaccia and a cannoli.  The sandwich was really tasty and the cannoli was decent...definitely not the best I've ever had.  The atmosphere is really comfortable and there are several tables outside as well.  Nice that they have a drive thru too...might check that out next time!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and it's always been really good. I don't know why the reviews are bad. The two star about the open doors is hilarious to me. Close the doors then!  The French toast and the pancakes are delicious. Ask for extra syrup. I've also had a salad and a sandwich that were also yummy and big enough to share, and you can't go wrong with the baked goods."}
{"text":"They discontinued the Cesar Salad?? What kind of salad place does not have a cesar salad. I've ordered this every time I have gone. Tried to order it today and was told they no longer have it. The lady said they made it for a little bit after it was discontinued in order to let everyone know that it was being discontinued. They did this in order to avoid inconveniencing anyone. However the past 6 times I have ordered no one let me know. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from Kneaders and have been here multiple times. There are several problems wrong with this place.  First, I consistently get the chunky cinnamon french toast. It is either fantastic, or absolutely terrible. I also ask for extra whip and strawberries, due to them offering very little to begin with. I have probably ordered this a dozen times, before they start charging me $1.50 extra. The price is already decent for what you get, but does it really cost you that much for whip and strawberries? There was never an issue before? When I inquired about how long this extra charge was implemented, her response was a very rude \"since forever.\" After going two or three more times, it seems that she is the only person that either tells me about the extra charge, or is the only person that charges me extra for it. Either say, this place has very little consistency both in quality, and in service.  Second, the drive-thru is slow, and half the time they get my order wrong. I ordered a hot chocolate, which they forgot to give me. Once I came back for it, they handed it back to me saying \"Oops, I forgot!\" It was cold and I asked them to remake it, which they refused.   Third, their prices are a bit high for what they are selling. I have mostly tried their breakfast food, and I've yet to try their lunch food. Smoothies are okay.  Terrible service. Decent food (which can either be on a range from decent to terrible). The only reason I go here is because of proximity. If you want a decent bakery, find your local Paradise or Panera."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Kneaders in Utah and Arizona for years. The food is always good but this location is unfortunately slow and the staff is not as helpful as other locations. I wish the customer service at this location lived up to their sister stores."}
{"text":"I went in for the first time today and was hoping for a extraordinary experience based on the lines inside and outside. I waited in line looking at these beautiful pastries that made me more hungry by the second. I was surprised that with the move in today's society there were not a lot of vegetarian options. I decided on the veggie sandwich. I specifically asked the cashier what was on the sandwich because, the were out of menus. She first had to ask someone else who came over and told me there were peppers, onions, mushrooms, and they removed the eggplant then add avocado. That's it on the bread I had chosen. So after all of that and being told they can't make it...wait now they can. Ok, great! I asked can I try the broccoli salad. She said; \"we don't sell that.\" Huh, did I miss something?? You don't sell a salad that's in the display case?? So, she asked the manager if they were aloud to sell those. He stated they were. I asked if the one with broccoli had bacon and since it didn't if I could have a sample. He said they didn't give samples of those. Now these are remade salads like you by in the deli counters! I am a new customer, this is a new establishment, and yet they can't give one sample. It seems ridiculous. Especially since if it didn't have bacon I would by it all the time. In addition I ordered a Napoleon because I am a sucker to a good one! I waited and my name was called and a young lady came and brought my meal to me. Upon delivery she said my sandwich was something else and I noticed that it had this white sauce dripping all over it!!!! I asked her what that sauce was?? She was slightly rude when she replied, she said that it was their Kneaders sauce and walked off. She didn't bother to make sure the order was correct nor come back and that I was alright. No I sat there wiping this overabundance of sauce that was on both sides of this sandwich( and dripping off when I took that first bite) for 5 min. and yet it was so saturated it did no good. Not to mention the veggies I was expecting....no such luck!!!! I received lettuce, tomato, red onion, and avocado, and  provolone. Nothing like the sandwich explained to me!!! To be honest I was more furious about that sauce, especially since I specifically asked what was on the sandwich and that was never mentioned that anything else. I couldn't get up because my place would be taken immediately this place was so busy.  Now for the Napoleon.....the part I wanted to be the saving grace of the meal. I was hoping to dig my fork into some nice beautiful custard in between those thick layers of fluffy whipped cream....Nothing!!! That's all it was whipped cream....I took bite, after bite,..nothing. Finally I threw it away because it was just too much and just whipped cream.  On a positive note, the 12 grain walnut bread I had was absolutely delicious!!! It was soft on the inside and so much flavor!!! I will definitely be buying that bread!"}
{"text":"Rude manager everybody was mad they have all been waiting 30 minutes or more to get their food. Worst place ever there is only one good location.  Do a better job at staffing. This is not hard."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning around 11am. There was no seating left, and the line was to the door. It took about 15 minutes to get to the register to order. We only ordered drinks. Well, after another 20 minutes of waiting for our drinks, we finally complained. They apologized for the wait and gave us some free pastries, and then had our drinks in about 5 more minutes. Subpar service, and the drinks weren't anything great! Prices were high as well."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh, friendly, and clean!  Sophia Stucki took extremely good care of us. She knew everything on the menu and explained to us patiently. The ambiance was extremely nice. We are excited that they have moved in the Surprise area!"}
{"text":"It was an interesting lunch experience at Kneaders the other day. There's a lot to like about this place, mainly the food is good. Somewhere like Panera mixed with Le Madeline.   The order line is where my frustration starts. The line is made uncomfortably narrow by the bakery case on one side and a gift bag workstation on the other. The times I've been there, the line seemed extra slow because there's only one cash register.   This time, we were in line behind a nice family right before 1:00. They got through their order, so did we. About the time noticed that the food seemed to be taking too long, somebody came out and told the family who'd been in front of us that they were out of whatever they'd ordered. This was at 1:22! Looking at my receipt, we had ordered at 1:05, which means this poor customer has been waiting on their food for over 20 minutes, only to be told that they'd need to make another choice. Our food finally came at 1:30. Why does a fast casual place take so long?"}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of kneaders and am always pleased with the wonderful customer service I usually receive. However, today was different. I pulled up to the drive through and the girl just asked me what what I wanted right away. Usually the person taking my order has some kind of pleasant greeting. I ordered half a salad and soup combo. She asked what I wanted to drink and I attempted to order a smoothie and she told me that wasn't an option. I have been here several times and the workers have always improvised a way for me to get the smoothie but this girl made it seem like there was no way. I pulled up to get my food and she quickly opened the window and told me the total. Didn't say hi. Nothing. When she practically threw the bag at me I said have a good day and she just closed the window didn't say anything back not \"have a good day\" nothing. I pulled up noticed my bread I ordered was missing and my water bottle wasn't in the bag either. Nobody was behind me in line. I waited a good 2 minutes to see if she would realize she had forgotten my water and bread but the door never opened back up. I drove away unsatisfied. The food here is delicious and the customer service is USUALLY very satisfying. This girl needs to be talked too and trained on how to treat customers. She was young and this could've been her first job which is understandable. Coming from someone who has worked in customer service and the food industry for 6 years this is unacceptable behavior. The name on the receipt says \"bernice\"."}
{"text":"First time here this morning. Used the drive thru... service was excellent. Asked the clerk about the French toast, he said i wouldn't be disappointed. I WASN'T!!! It was served hot and fresh. The strawberries were sweet and that caramel syrup.....OMG!!! Definitely gonna be back to try some of the items on the menu. I love Panera and this is a great alternative since it's a lot closer."}
{"text":"I like Kneaders, but this location is so inconsistent with orders.  There is always something missing from the salads or there are more items of one thing and hardly any of another.  I ordered the BBQ chicken salad today and there were no avacado, or BBQ sauce:(  I will not be spending my money at this location."}
{"text":"The food was great, my daughter loved the sugar bee cookie."}
{"text":"Started frequenting Kneaders for their cinnamon rolls. Yum! My wife and I love coming for lunch."}
{"text":"Good selection of pastries and fresh coffee. I enjoy the French toast that comes with a side of fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Dinning room is always empty as I pull through the drive thru, yet it still takes 15-20 mins to get your food. If there's a car in front of you, good luck. Maybe read a book cause you'll be there for a while.   Service is horrible, the staff always forgets an item or two and don't know how to handle any situations. Their prices have also increased. 10$ for just a sandwich no combo or drink. 15$ for a combo, imagine if that's a family or a couple ordering. So expensive, might as well go into a fine dinning restaurant to spend that much instead of going here."}
{"text":"I'm addicted. Cute little home decor on the inside with a fireplace in the middle of the dining area. Have tried their sandwiches, soups (loaded potato is my fave!), frozen hot chocolate, chai lattes, and variety of hot teas. Everything has been flavorful, served quickly, and the right temperature. I can't seem to get enough of their frosted sugar cookies and loaves of bread. Being that I like Panera and Cracker Barrel and this is sort of a hybrid of the two, I always try to go there when I'm on my way into Anthem."}
{"text":"I really love this location. Their sandwiches are always delicious and my little one loves their smoothies. Every staff I've encountered has been friendly. Plus, you can't beat the drive thru! Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work meeting. Looked up their menu prior to arriving, food and drinks looked good. Unfortunately I only came for coffee, tried their ivory mocha over ice. It was decent and came out with not too much of a wait. Overall experience was okay, looking forward in going back to try their food."}
{"text":"I really want to say, \"I love this place!\". Unfortunately, I can't... this place is consistently inconsistent. When they are good- they are great! But those experiences are becoming farther and fewer between. I am a fan of their cream of broccoli soup and the strawberry tsunami smoothie. Lately- the soup has been watered down, tastelessness with an obvious layer of oil on top. (As seen in photo). It's like a bowl of warmed non-fat milk. No flavor, no broccoli and thinned out to a questionable level. The smoothies here you need to keep an eye on. If they run out of an ingredient that's called for in your smoothie, they will sub it out without saying anything. On more than enough occasions I've discovered my smoothie to have a \"different\" flavor, to then be told upon inquiry that they were out of X and just made it with Y. What if I don't like the Y ingredient (or are allergic?!). Tell me you're out of all the stuff to make my order and give me the option to pick an alternative or opt out... I just paid $16 for 2 bowls of soup we can't enjoy and a smoothie that is decent (this time...) #NotImpressed"}
{"text":"Ordered a turkey artichoke sandwich, and it's very tasty! But my partner ordered a latte with no foam and there's a lot of foam... like, 25% of the drink is foam. Service is nice, people are friendly, and the place is clean and homey, just wish they got his order right. Their soft rolls are really good, too."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since moving to East Mesa. I've tried a breakfast croissant and one of their fruit tarts. So delicious! The inside is very comfortable and clean, and the people who work here are very friendly. I'm so glad we found this place and I can see coming back here more."}
{"text":"My parents and I came for breakfast today and I'm so glad we did! I've ordered food to go from Kneaders, but it was so nice to sit and enjoy our food by the cozy little fireplace. The staff was super friendly, my French toast was delish, and we will definitely be back. Thumbs up Kneaders!"}
{"text":"Went today...my daughter ordered the turkey cranberry croissant. The cranberry sauce was very sour and did not appear to be cranberry sauce. I ordered the turkey bacon avocado salad. It came with blue cheese dressing. I went and changed it for ranch and when I was almost done, I realized there was no avocado on the salad. I've been here many times and this was by far my worst experience. Has the management changed??"}
{"text":"I accidntally found this place when my car got towed to the AAA Repair shop across the way.  The AAA guy recommended Kneaders so we walked across the parking lot to Kneaders.  What a treat.  The bakery case is extensive--so many beautiful choices.  The service was friendly and welcoming.  We had sandwich and soup combos and both were delicious.  The bread was fresh and tasty.  We were pleasantly surprised and then grabbed some treats to go.  I had a BLT specialty sandwich called Dave's BLT that also had cheese and onion on it.  Really delicious--would definitely get it again.  Can't wait to go back.  Need to explore the menu because there were so many things that we wanted to try.  I can't emphasize enough how fresh the food was.  Also the place was CLEAN and decorated in a very friendly way.  It just feels warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Got my Cheesecake. I'm so happy. We also tried the cheesecake brownies. Great way to end the evening."}
{"text":"Kneaders is SO good! We recently visited some family in Phoenix and ended up eating here twice!   I can't comment on their lunch items, but the cinnamon french toast is absolutely amazing! It is all you can eat from 7-11am but no one in our group could eat more than the 2 huge slices that they give you. The syrup is very buttery and good. It was a little less than $6 for the french toast.   The restaurant is new and set up very cute. They also have outdoor seating available.  They are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Met with some friends for breakfast here for the first time.  Very cute country home style feel.  They have some deal for unlimited French toast but I don't know how anyone can get past the first plate. I got the pancakes and couldn't even finish. My smoothie was delicious and brought home my pastry. This place has a meal deal like Panera where you can get 1/2 breakfast half pastry along the sorts.  It being first time here I was very undecided but my pancakes were delicious. Came with a side of whip cream and strawberries. The home made maple syrup had a unique flavor I've never had before which was amazing."}
{"text":"Update: 5/03/18 I am currently here and it's going on 15 mins for my bowl of soup to go. Why do I keep doing this to myself? The service has not gotten any better and the wait time is still way too slow. Finally got my soup, which is chicken tortilla, it did not have the tortilla strips it usually comes with. Asked for them and was informed that it doesn't come with them anymore........bummer."}
{"text":"Good food, bad training. Two dining experiences and they blew it both times. Waited 20 min for my food and went up to ask where it was- they lost the ticket. 2nd time- messed up my order/food. Not impressed with the food preparation."}
{"text":"First time here and I liked it. It has a nice comfortable feel about it. The staff was friendly and helped with all the questions I had about the menu. I got a half ham sandwich with potato soup. Very good! They brought out a turkey sandwich by mistake when we told the manager she let us keep it which made my husband happy so he could eat it and she brought out my ham sandwich real fast. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I haven't fully made up my mind on if I actually like Kneaders or not. I really like the concept, homemade food on a fast food dime, but I felt like all of the food was stuff I could have made just as easily at home... I just wasn't that impressed.   I ordered the ham and swiss sandwich on a french baguette and it was such a pain to eat. The bread was tough to bite through causing all the inner goodness to slip right out. My boyfriend got the BLT on white bread and as he's pretty easy going, he liked it.   I did go back and buy a loaf of their zucchini bread after sampling it. However when I asked the girl at the counter how long the entire loaf would last she said 24 hours... They need some training on their products because that bad boy lasted a week without drying out. (buy it, you wont regret it.)"}
{"text":"I love their Chicken Chop Salad with homemade croutons from their freshly baked bread and I substitute ranch instead of bleu cheese. Their salads are always fresh and top notch ingredients. My kids favorite kids meal is at Kneaders. There's a lot of variety for the price and their grilled cheese is so good because of their bread. Their unlimited french toast is so filling and they don't just offer the run of the mill syrup. It's a homemade caramel syrup served with fresh strawberries. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We ate at Kneaders 5 times in three days.  Bottomless cinnamon french toast.  Delicious smoothies. Turkey & cranberry croissant sandwiches. Delicious baked goods including Mini-key lime pie and Citrus & chocolate cannoli.   Pleasant country store atmosphere with a small boutique offering a variety of well-chosen unique gifts and custom gift-wrapping.  Outside drive-through for people in a hurry.  Personable, cheerful staff who notice regular customers.  This place is a gem."}
{"text":"No WiFi.  Not impressed with the salad that I had (Citrus Turkey).  All salads are pre-prepared so they're not fresh at all.    Lots of staff on break (3) and they take up 2 of the booths that customers would love to use.  LOTS of trash on the floor (a pet peeve of mine).  I expected more, I suppose I set my hopes for a good bakery too high."}
{"text":"Went again,but late morning. Service is so slow. Just wanted to buy pastries to go. Had a few people in line. Ordered my pastries, but it took another 10 minutes to pay. They tried to give me some other order. Had to wait another 5 minutes for them to sort out the orders. Finally left after 20 minutes just for takeout pastries. Muffins are good, but need a few more minutes in the oven. Go if you have a lot of time and lots of patience."}
{"text":"The devil is in the details. After months of driving by Kneaders and seeing the parking lot filled I decided to stop in at 11:00 a.m. the other morning because no one was in the drive thru lane. Got my order in for a turkey, avocado, bacon salad and proceeded to the drive thru window. There was car in front of me and that car sat there for over 10 minutes while waiting for their order. Figured someone would have suggested the car move up so those of us with simple orders could pay and move on, nope. After getting to the window the first thing I noticed was how filthy the glass windows were at drive up. Finger prints and general yuk, didn't look like they'd been cleaned in sometime. Actually, a real turn off thinking if the attention to details at the the drive up was this way, then how would the food prep, kitchen area look like in terms of cleanliness? Okay, got my salad and headed back to work to eat. Salad looked interesting initially until I dug in. Red onions chopped in a variety of sizes, styles, inconsistent at best. Got rid of them. Turkey tasted and looked like some odd chicken that had been processed who knows how. Got past that and continued to eat. Then came the lettuce. Oddly cut with some pieces the size of an adult's hand, tiny pieces, others that were partially cut and when trying to eat a lengthy fold of lettuce that wasn't even cut was revealed. Who is prepping salads? Then we can get into the lettuce that was old evidenced by red aging on the ends of the lettuce. It was a toss of about 1/4 of the salad because the lettuce had turned. Obviously prepped by someone who doesn't care and supervision by someone else that simply doesn't pay attention to detail. So, my anticipated visit to a new local food option went awry. Will I be back, not sure? If the attention to the ingredients in my salad is any indication of how a sandwich would be presented then I'll pass. A disappointment after hoping for a new eating option in the Anthem area."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. It was great. The food was fresh and delicious and the pastries are amazing. We brought a yummy delicious loaf of warm cinnamon bread. It smells and looks fantastic. We are so excited to have a new option in the NW part of the valley. Yay!!"}
{"text":"Great food....only complaint is that breakfast ends at 1100 on weekends.  Ended up having lunch and buying some baked good which were all amazing.  Your food is so good just wish you would consider extending breakfast....move to a better Henderson location if you need more room."}
{"text":"Hi All,   My girlfriend and I live down the street and we really like this place!  We get the club or turkey bacon avocado and it is very good.  The chocolate dome and cinnamon roll are very tasty as well!     The reason I gave this place a 3 star is do to cleanliness which if you look at my photo you will understand.   This photo is their front line tray displayed items and for over a MONTH the top glass has never been wiped down!   If they are missing simple things like this what else could be lurking in the back?"}
{"text":"Anyone from Utah can attest to how amazing Kneaders bakery is.  It's fresh and delicious.  Their breads are amazing.  I love their salads and soups for lunch.  Their desserts are bomb... And on the weekends try their French toast :)."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at Kneaders when I was living in Salt Lake City and was so sad when I realized there wasn't one very close to my house after moving here. I was so excited when this location opened and it's just as good as I remember! The Veggie Avacado on Focassia bread is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Once again, Kneaders has been success! I tried breakfast for the first time and was not disappointed. I tried the croissant with egg, bacon, and cheese and it was deeeelish! I also enjoyed a chi tea latte, a little on the cold side, but still just as yummy! Service was also friendly! I had to wait in the drive through for about 5 mins, but that was totally understandable with me being there so early in the morning. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"First time today. So good. Got mini fruit tart which was amazing. Not too sweet. Soup and salad. I will be back again. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Always super fast service and delicious food! I really want to come here before 11 so that I can enjoy their breakfast because it all sounds amazing! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried out the chicken, cheese, and ham sandwich; it was so delicious! The employees were very polite and the food came out very quickly. This was the first time that I frequented this particular location and was impressed with how quickly the food was coming out because the restaurant was fairly busy. Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"I ordered 100 dollar sandwiches online for a family event.  The sandwiches arrived with only the slightest hint of dressing, and just a whisper of meat and cheese.  I have no idea why they thought that was appropriate to serve to my guests.  I was prepared with veggies to add to the sandwiches but not more meat and cheese.  Very poor experience."}
{"text":"I visited this Kneaders today on my lunch break (since I forgot my lunch at home this morning) and I was having a rough day. I was greeted by a man named Gino who took the time to explain the ingredients of each item I asked about. He was very helpful and provided EXCELLENT customer service! The sandwich I ordered was delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried kneaders for first time today and got the turkey avocado bacon salad...it was tasty but could of had some more veggies!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is not very good. My sister and I have been waiting for our order for fifteen minutes, we've been watching it sit in the kitchen (the entire order) for about five. There is no line, and there are at least three people working the front counter."}
{"text":"Love love love the breakfast and all the pastries!! I ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese croissant and it was soooo delicious, I never wanted it to end! I couldn't even snap a picture because I inhaled it so quickly.  The croissant tasted so fresh and the ratio of the cheese, egg, and bacon were on point. I went through the drive thru and they were very fast (granted it was 7:05 am and they open at 7am).  I wish they were open on Sundays!! I have also had the chocolate croissant and cinnamon roll which are both so delicious! (Also, you can ask them to heat them both up which is even better!!!)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently moved to Gilbert and have patiently watched and waited as this establishment was being built. We've since been there twice first for dinner and second for pastries. Dinner was definitely very busy (as it was opening night) but our food was delicous.  The restaurant seemed a slight more upscale than the Paneras we've been to in the past,  in terms of variety of ingredients and a slight higher cost. Though the portions were very big so next time we will probably stick with half sandwhiches instead of full. I got the chicken pesto panni (which half went home as leftovers) and he got the cheese melt sandwich. The chips were different and complemented the sandwich well. The desserts we got were very delicious. My particular favorites were the double fudge brownies and chocolate mousse domes. We will definitely be dining here again in the future. The staff was very friendly and quickly fixed some dessert mix ups for us."}
{"text":"Terrible service this morning....waited for 40 min for an omelette and breakfast sandwich.  They finally brought it out and said sorry we gave your food to someone else.  No offer to comp or give some treat.  Very poor service and will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"So wonderful to have a wholesome dine in restaurant so close to our home.   Great food with a lot of variety."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Kneaders Bakery and Cafe. I was so excited when I walked in and seen the display cases filled with pastries and desserts. Everything looked so fresh and yummy. I ordered the chunky cinnamon French toast and it was delish. Fresh strawberries and cream were to die for! Also their free samples of the pumpkin and snickerdoodle bread was a sweet surprise. I loved the snickerdoodle bread!"}
{"text":"Want to be fair to this place.  Sometimes I get a little critical over inconsistencies in the food.  Been back a few more times, sandwich/soup/salads...perfect!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Kneaders and my smoothie was bomb! The cashier was sweet and we sat on the patio with the dogs! Dog friendly is always good. I called prior to going to check on the dogs and the manager was very sweet as well! The menu is a little odd as far as it doesn't say what's in anything, but the names are relatively self explanatory, so that's good. The food was pretty good and not huge portions for the French toast and panini my girlfriend got. I would definitely go back and try more items!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice this week. Once when it was super slow, like only 4 people in the entire place and then 2 days later where yes it was pretty busy, but both times they have been extremely slow and taking orders wrong. I am still currently waiting (now for the past 20 minutes) to box up 2 dozen cinnamon roles. Within that time standing here several people have come up to complain about missing items on their meal or never getting their meal and asking for a refund. I will say that when people did complain they would fix it or give them a refund with no questions asked which is good, but honestly most of what I saw or heard shouldn't have happened to begin with. Overall definitely good food but only if you receive it."}
{"text":"Kneaders has a very homey feel as soon as you walk in the door. The smell of fresh baked bread permeates the sinuses immediately.  Oh so good. The decor during this visit had a grandma's house home for the holidays feel.  With the maple wood cabinetry and Christmas tree and even stockings hanging from the fireplace, it just felt cozy inside.  Kneader's has a pretty simple menu that includes a handful of sanwiches, salads, and house made soups. I decided to go with the famous Club sandwich with roasted turkey (like thanksgiving style), ham, roast beef, LTO and Kneader's sauce. The sauce was an amazing combo of mayo, mustard and sour cream which was quite delicious.  Served on country french bread which was definitely a highlight of the  famous Club sandwich.  The bread was so soft and fluffy on the inside while have a crunchy crust, one of the best breads I've had in a while.   I also tried the Artichoke Portobello Soup. With chunks of carrots and mushrooms through the rich and creamy chicken broth and artichoke base. The soup was pretty good. On the menu they also had Broccoli cheese, French Onion, and Chicken Noodle, I'm looking forward to trying these flavors as well.   I am disappointed I did not get to try the desserts.  They are very tempting because you have to walk by the pastry case to get to the ordering counter. I asked to many questions today and completely spaced my dessert order. Oh well next time. Which might be later this evening. Hahaha. They looked that good.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time they forgot something in our to go order. The 1st time was our drink from the kids menu and the 2nd time was the cookie from the kids menu. I glanced in the bag and it looked like everything was there but it wasn't. I will give it one more try but I'm not happy."}
{"text":"Over priced sandwiches that don't live up to the hype. You'll get a better sandwich and bigger portions at Paradise Bakery just down the road."}
{"text":"The food is ok, coffee is good, service is a horrendous disaster!! Wow! Rude, unhelpful and stressful. The young girl behind the counter was arguing about my daughters nut  allergy when it was clear that the pastry had nuts!! She rolled her eyes and stomped off saying \"not my problem\" lol can you believe it!? This place is stressful to order and he kids working there are rude and just ignore. They have no clue what's even going on. When we went in to order they got the whole thing wrong, thank goodness I looked in the box before I left. I was amazed how rude everyone was. I just asked the manager to refund me and then we left. Don't waste your time with this hole.. summary: rude staff, so so food, ok coffee, misguided and misrepresenting staff, NOT NUT ALLERGY FRIENDLY!! Awful experience!"}
{"text":"One of the best Kneaders I have been to. Clean, great staff and terrific food. Even my husband, who thinks Taco Bell is a gourmet dinning experience and was wanting to not like Kneaders, was impressed. Turkey avacado and bacon on sourdough for him, chicken al mondo for me. Great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is delicious and when I was in the other day there was a horrible lady in line who was awful to the entire staff and others and the staff here were so kind and patient. Such yummy food! I don't know if I will even go to Panera anymore because this is so much more convenient and has so many options."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. My wife and I have enjoyed this place until recently. We have either come in or ordered on postmates. Recently, i placed an order through postmates and Kneaders took the order and edited it on their end and I ended up paying agonist $70 for two combos, soup, and a pastry. I tried contacting post mates but they are saying that Kneaders gave me four sandwiches (basically they are saying they doubled my order) which they most certainly did not do. I will be contacting my bank to dispute the charge."}
{"text":"We went there for the second time last night and we won't be back. I ordered a chicken pesto panini sandwich. The menu says \"pesto sauce\" but there is no pesto on it, just some butter with a few green specks. Plus the cheese wasn't even melted and the whole thing was cold. I pointed this out to the \"manager\" whose only response was \"it's pesto butter, and that's how it's been made the whole time Ive been here.\" Well that's nice but I don't care how it's been made, it is NOT what is advertised on the menu. So either change the menu or give the customer what they think they are ordering. He did NOTHING. Very rude response, and a gross sandwich. This is the second time we've experienced rude and unconcerned customer service, the first time the girl just looked at me after I pointed out that the counter in front of the register (where I had put my purse down to pay) was covered with water. My 8 year old eveb had more common sense to ask for paper towels to wipe it up. She just stared at us. Even the women in line behind me couldnt believe it. We gave it a second chance because things happen, but this seems to be the culture at this restaurant and we will go somewhere where our business is valued in the future."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is super slow., both inside and especially in the drive thru.This is the second time I've waited almost 30 min. for my order of only soup and half of a sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is so cute inside. The soup is great! Way better than fast food!! You can get baked goods, fresh breads, sandwiches, soups and even gifts!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite bakery & cafe! The food was amazing even my picky eater loved it! The Christmas boutique set up inside was so charming and the gift baskets were amazing! I will definitely be back and will likely pick up a gift basket or two for Christmas!!"}
{"text":"I use this Kneaders every week or two for catering needs through my employer. Mariah, their catering coordinator, has been so awesome to work with. She has awesome customer service skills and I'm able to text her with any questions/orders. Mariah and every employees positive attitude has been the reason this Kneaders is my go-to place for catering orders. Sorry Panea and Zuppas"}
{"text":"I ordered a bacon, avocado, and turkey sandwich and they forgot my bacon.  worst part is it was take out so I was at home when I realized, when I called I had to explain the situation to three different people to get to the manager. I feel like they need better communication and then maybe they wouldn't have to give out free sandwiches for messing up. Haven't been back to get my free sandwich yet but when I do I'm going to ask for the bacon they forgot  Also I don't really know if the first sandwich was good because it was missing bacon but I will report back"}
{"text":"They were out of multiple items, soup was watery, staff wasn't very friendly. Many cute gifts though, wrapped nicely. Ordered a Caeser salad, no croutons. Came with rubbery chicken that I didn't request. We felt as if we were a bother when asking for things. I asked for croutons and the girl said \"well did you ask for them?\" I thought Caeser salad came with them. Then they said they were out."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of three times. The third time was the straw that broke the camel's back.   The first time I ordered the veggie sandwich with no sauce. It had sauce, a lot mayo-naise looking sauce. I don't do mayo, so when I took it up to the counter, she grabbed it out of my hand so hard the sandwich slid from the plate. My lunch partner was done eating by the time they brought me a different one. it's literally just bread and veggies. No cooking required.   The second time I ordered just a bowl of soup. From the time I ordered until the time it was given to me was 23 min. When I told the food runner, she said \"well the drive thru takes priority\". Rude.   Today I did the drive-thru thinking it would be much faster and it's the closest place to work I can get soup without getting out of my car. It wasn't quick by any means but it was decent. I ordered a half-sandwich and a cup of soup. I ordered Asiago Bisque. I'm thinking it's like a tomato bisque but instead of tomatoes they used a boatload of cheese.  Ham. It had ham. Why? I don't eat ham, I can't eat ham.  So now here I sit with a cup of soup in the garbage can (there was no one at work to give it to) and a belly that's not quite full.   Three attempts. Three disappointments."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the staff is nice and food was great. I had a bread bowl which was so delicious and filling along with a fruit smoothie!  I would say it's more pricey than the competitors like paradise bakery, zupas, or the like. But, they do have a reward program that probably works well if you go a lot."}
{"text":"Had very bad experience with this restaurant went into to order 1 quart soup cream of broccoli and 3 sourdough rolls looked like a small family and another customer ahead.  Waited about 4-5 minutes line still the same looked up to see video monitor saw 1 vehicle left and got in line a little late 1 more pulled in before me  . Ok couple more minutes  oops couple more cars ahead of me than I originally thought . Well it can't take to long ? Wrong I finally pulled up to order 5 more minutes had gone by was told no broccoli soup waited trying to call family no answer . Should've waited in line was stuck almost 15 minutes more they need to pull people out of the way worst service ever . Food is great but employees are to slow !  They need to treat it more like business than a family picnic don't know if I'll go back again. Gave it 2 stars for food quality , to bad service wasn't better maybe I'll try it another year"}
{"text":"I love Kneaders. I'm happy they opened up so close to where I am. The place is great for family's and it's like Panera but WAAAY better and more affordable.   They make everything from scratch and their breakfast is to die for. I usually order the French toast or the turkey bacon avocado. Their pastries are really good as well.  The service is a bit slow but it's understandable since they just opened and a lot of times they hire kids with this being their first job. Nonetheless they train them to be courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT THE SIGNAL BUTTE LOCATION!!!! INFESTED WITH COCKROACHES!!!!!!!! I rarely write reviews add whenever I take the time out to do so they are always for excellent service or good experiences. I am so dissapointed in the service i recieved at this restaurant I feel it is worth my time to do so.  Last night i wanted to take my parents and brother to kneaders after i got off of work. The restaurant closes at 10 and we got there at 9:20pm. When we walked in the young dark haired girl at the front made it very apparent that she was NOT HAPPY that we arrived so late as they were cleaning to close. I felt bad for getting so late but i knew we would be out by 10pm when they closed. She was so rude taking and made it known she was less then thrilled to be there, as she was taking our order she made no eye contact and rolled her eyes when i asked what was in an item on the menu. My parents and i were joking that she was probably spitting in our food as they were preparing it back there because her attitide was so bad. We got our food and started to eat quickly as we all felt very rushed by the staff. As my brother was almost through with his chicken ceaser salad he let out a big yell. We all looked at what he was freaking out about and there was a decent sized COCKROACH IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL IN HIS SALAD.... STILL ALIVE!!!!!  I completely understand this happens at restaurants where there is food there is roaches i understand. The young dark haired girl from before clearly heard what happened. We still had to call her to our table for assitance. She was less then thrilled. She actually seemed that she could careless about the situation taking place. When we told her there was a roach in the salad she didnt say anything but walked away and was talking to a bigger blond haired women in the back. We are assuming a \"manager\" they were laughing about something throught the converstaion. The young dark haired women comes back and said \"we could give you a refund\" and walks away my mom had to walk up to the counter as nobody approached her to make the refund they were all talking to each other in the back. The blond \"manager lady\" takes the recipt from my mother and refunds only the one salad. Even though all of our dinners were wasted because nobody had an appetite anymore after looking at the roach walking around in the ceaser dressing at the bottom of the salad bowl. We got no apology. None of us were able to finish our dinner after we were so disgusted by the discovery of the cockroach and the employees acted as of this happens all the time, they were not at all suprised by this or apologetic for the bug being in the food. I am so dissapointed and embarrased that i have been raving about this place to my family i never get to see them and the one night we try to enjoy dinner the entire night was ruined not even over a roach but by the attitudes of these 2 women and how poorly we were treated.  I have never had worse service anywhere in my entire life. I am so dissapointed. Kneaders is great and its worth the drive to the one on Higley and the 60. DO NOT EAT HERE. These employees will have this place closed in no time, treating customers as we were treated.   And by the way we were out before 10pm (closing time) even after finding a cock roach in our food and having to deal with the refund process so there was no reason for the way we were treated, talked to and looked at. I have never been so dissapointed in my life."}
{"text":"Kneaders has such a fun atmosphere, and the smell is to die for! My husband and I love coming here for a date night or for breakfast. You know it's a good day when the sandwich is almost as big as your face. Also, we had a question about our order and the manager was SO nice and helpful. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY!  I went to Kneaders on January 5, 2018 with 2 co-workers for lunch for the first time.  I ordered 1/2 Pastrami sandwich on Rye and a cup of Rustic Baked Potato Soup.  The bill came to $8.75.  The sandwich had 1 piece of thin sliced Pastrami....RIDICULOUS!  The soup was delicious.  Every place that I have ordered a 1/2 Pastrami sandwich came piled high with Pastrami.  For $8.75 I definitely did not get my money's worth.  I will NEVER visit this establishment again and will NEVER recommend Kneaders.  As a matter of fact, I will advise everyone NOT to go there.  I could have went to a Deli and Purchase more than 1 piece of Pastrami for $8.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the French dip and soup and it was absolutely amazing! The bread pudding was great. It is way too crowded at lunch hour but that is a good thing. They even have limes out for the iced tea. Seems like a little thing but, I love it."}
{"text":"I have tried Kneaders a few times already. I went once for take out and twice for dinner. On the day when I just went for take out, I was picking up a meal for a friend. This was my first time. It was during the day. The place was busy and had a nice atmosphere. The bread and dessert selection was big and very inviting, I was so tempted to buy something for myself but decided to wait for a second time when I dine in.   A few weeks later my husband and I decided to try Kneaders for a quick dinner. Place was pretty empty because we came in kinda late. We ordered the chicken salad croissant (unfortunately they were out of croissant) and a turkey sandwich. Both were meals so we got a side with them. I got an extra soup and side salad, my husband only added a soup. I went for the chicken tortilla soup and my husband decided to try the cream of broccoli soup.  Both sandwiches were pretty good. Soup and salad were also good. I tasted my husband's cream of broccoli and it was delicious.   I also tried their strawberry cream pie on that day and it was so good, the strawberries were fresh and so delicious.   Prices in Kneaders are slightly on the higher side. Quality of the food is good, 4 stars for me. Atmosphere is much nicer in the day than at night. It's in our neighborhood so it's a good addition to our selection of restaurants/cafes in the area."}
{"text":"My daughter and I eat here about once a week. We love the speedy and friendly service. I typically order our food online so we just have to grab and go, super convenient! I'm glad that more restaurants are popping up in this area - especially when they never get your order wrong."}
{"text":"Was craving something fresh and delicious - Kneaders was exactly that. We enjoyed an large greens avocado salad, peanut butter cookie, turkey cranberry croissant sandwich, morning sunshine smoothie, pink piña colada smoothie, and a cream cheese brownie. None of which disappointed!"}
{"text":"Kneaders... Kneaders... Where do I start? I like the idea of Kneaders. Soups, sandwhiches, and salads- yum. Their deserts look tasty though I haven't tried them... They have cute little signs, jewelry, and stuff(?) that you could buy as a gift... interestingly! I don't think the seating set up is very innovative or comfortable. The line is horrendous and takes FOREVER. Why... oh why do you have one cashier when you have at least 3 registers and the line is long- well... for a normal resteraunt that could handle a rush it wouldn't be too long- this is not one of those places. I think the food is generally pretty good- their bread is nice... but the tomatoes my friend had in her salad were not ripe, my tomato basil ravioli soup tasted like the great... er- Chef Boyardi, and my sandwhich of which I requested no red onions- had onions. There were people letting their kids run all over the place and scream their heads off. And the place is overpriced. And they don't really have any good combos- such as half of a salad and soup... Overall, the experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth. And now I know why the other resteraunts in this parking lot have much more business... I will only come back if I am desperate. Maybe. :/"}
{"text":"I love the Arcadia location of Kneaders, I love Kneaders in general.   To me this place is an elevated Panera, with a great bakery and really good food. My favorite items are the sourdough pancakes, the broccoli and cheese soup and the BLT with avocado. The pancakes are seriously some of the best pancakes I have ever had, the sourdough taste is subtle but it really brings them over the top.  The only drawback is that they're closed on Sundays (they're like the Chick-Fil-A of bakery chains).  Great spot though, centrally located in Arcadia."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out today for lunch! Quick, friend service which was great! Lots of options to choose from. We got the ruben panini and the chicken salad sandwich. Both were good lunch options! They also serve breakfast and their desserts looked amazing! Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I had the BEST turkey avocado sandwich ever. It was so giant. The bread was so fluffy and the team was so nice! Try the sandwich. Promise you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Mercedes and the Kneaders San Tan pastry team (including the pastry chef) make the best baked goods available! They have made me several special orders and they always get it right. I like to order a large box of cookies and freeze them so I can enjoy one each day. I am very particular but feel confident in recommending Kneaders as a great place for a meal and delicious dessert. Kneaders is casual but nice and a great place to treat yourself or meet someone. very friendly and helpful folks working there too."}
{"text":"While their food is nothing amazing or to rave about, it's an easy drive through meal that is better than other drive through options.  However, the last THREE times we've gone through the drive through our order has been incorrect every single time.  So it will probably be awhile before we come back.  The errors are just too much to justify continuing to go.  1) the first time we ordered a kids meal (grilled cheese), got home to find out there was no sandwich in our kids meal.  Just a milk, cookie and bag of grapes.  So I ended up making our daughter a sandwich at home.  2) The second time in our kids meal we received grapes, chips, two milks, and a sandwich.  Our sandwich order (adult meals) was correct. 3) Third visit in the drive through, ordered potato salad with one of our sandwiches and didn't receive it, (received green salad instead), iced tea was supposed to be large and was given a reg.  They obviously need some quality control on the drive through line.  It appears reading through the other reviews that we are not the only ones who have had issues with receiving the correct order via the drive through."}
{"text":"What a wonderful hidden treasure in Seven Hills/Anthem area. We will be frequent diners here. So many healthy choices and some worth the calories dishes. First thing you smell is the fresh baked breads as your eyes fixate on the beautiful display of artistic and rustic desserts to choose from. Soups are hearty and hot. So much to choose from the menu. The food is made fresh in house and the price is right. We spent less than $20. Staff is friendly and patient. Great service with a smile. Don't be jealous there are two locations in town and I suggest you find one close to you  P.S. Download the App"}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment. I've eaten at Kneaders in other states and had a positive experience so I'm surprised I had such an awful experience top to bottom.  First off, we were the only people in there. Because of this, the place was spotless with every employee in there bored and cleaning tables over and over. Not once did anyone ask how our food was or our experience - not even the manager who was there. I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich and the cream of broccoli soup. My sandwich had no pesto on it, it was completely dry. One half of my sandwich had a total of 5 of the saddest tiny pieces of chicken I've ever seen. It wasn't anywhere close to covering the bread. So I combined that chicken with the other half to make one good half sandwich. I went to the counter to tell them my sandwich had no pesto (thinking its new restaurant growing pains) and the girl proceeds to tell me it's actually a pesto butter and that next time I need to ask for extra if I want more. Ok? Once I added this and the chicken, my half sandwich was pretty good. The soup was not warm, it's probably been sitting in its vat for hours since the place is dead. It was gross.  I also got a chocolate covered strawberry with walnuts - which, much to my dismay, was soggy and did not taste good. It must have been sitting on the shelf too long.  The only positive thing I have to say is the place was so clean since all the workers were bored and cleaned the empty restaurant the whole time.   I might try the place again in a few months if they're not out of business."}
{"text":"Love Kneaders! My favorite salad is the Turkey Cranberry with mushrooms and sunflower seeds. Always get their rye bread to go with it. It's a healthy & quick lunch when I'll on the go. Don't forget  desserts! Their delicious & made fresh every day."}
{"text":"The chunky French toast is a must try! Sabrina did a great job and making suggestions and I'm glad listened. Next time I think I want to the pancakes."}
{"text":"I have ordered the \"Chicken Pesto\" sandwich from this particular location twice already. The first time was amazing. It had the perfect amount of sauce, chicken, and the rest of the ingredients. Today, however I was a bit disappointed. Although it was delicious (as always), the piece of chicken was so thin that it looked like it was just the 2 bread slices. I literally got one leaf of spinach on each half and the tomato was not so fresh. On the bright side, their desserts are amazing and I highly recommend visiting Kneaders for a pastry!"}
{"text":"Is there a reason why their drive-through is consistently, literally (yes, I am using the term correctly) a 30+ minute wait when there are only 2 cars ahead of you?  This is not one-time occurrence, either.  This has happened to me probably 5 times.  And there's no escape.  The curb boxes you in so if you were planning on getting your food in 5 minutes and you're still sitting there 30 minutes later and you have somewhere important to be, tough luck.  You can't get out.  My sister once experienced this and when she got to the front of the line, she said, \"If my food is not in your hand to give to me right now, I am sorry, but I have to go.  I cannot wait one minute longer.\"  To top it off, I once had my credit card information stolen there and also, my salad, purchased through the drive-through, was once so wilted that it was inedible.  I complained to corporate but they don't give two craps about it - I never heard back.  I really wish we had more choices here in North Mesa.  Thank goodness we finally have a Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Multiple times my order has been inaccurate. Watch yourself in the drive through, they are careless and my orders have been wrong. A disappointment when you're on a limited lunch break and find your order is wrong. DOUBLE CHECK YOUR ORDERS BEFORE LEAVING. One can't depend on them. As for the cashier, she needs to learn to smile. Ahwatukee branch is nothing like this one, they are on the ball. If only I didn't work in Gilbert and this branch is my local when I'm working."}
{"text":"Ala Mondo salad good and fresh, the tarts used to be good but they changed the recipe since first opened and not as fresh and creamy. Mint brownie excellent. Soups potato and 3 cheese cauliflower and mushroom Brie all excellent."}
{"text":"Came Saturday morning around 10:30 am and it was busy but not packed. Pretty far out of the way but not too far for much of Henderson. Had breakfast, the greek omelette. Dad had the bacon egg and cheese croissant. Shared an apple bread pudding.   My greek omelette tasted delicious. Not overly stuffed but a decent amount of feta and spinach. Just right. Dad enjoyed his croissant sandwich, but it's pretty hard to mess that up. Croissant was flaky and buttery. The apple pudding was amazing. Sweet but not too much. Lots of goodies for the whole family. Worth trying and I'll be back again I'm sure."}
{"text":"Our first visit today. Not sure we'll go back. One person taking orders even though there were a bunch of people in line. Most of the empty tables were dirty, so we had to clean one off to sit down. The salad and sandwich we ordered were very basic. Not much flavor. Bathroom was also dirty. On the plus side, the bread was good and the baked goods looked amazing (didn't have any)."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Ordered turkey & cranberry croissant sandwich. Prices pretty good for amount & quality of food. Amazing. Will be back."}
{"text":"Did you know Kneaders has breakfast?? Their \"all you can eat\" French toast is a favorite in our house, but I personally like their breakfast sandwiches. You can't go wrong with their baked goods and breads. I haven't found a carb there I didn't like.   Honestly lunch/dinner can be hit or miss. The food is good when prepared correctly (sometimes workers can be skimpy on sauce, etc). Their soups are usually always delicious and their salads are yummy."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it opened and it has gone down hill.  Soups are always out, staff doesn't look like they want to be here and food is hit or miss.  Bread is large and meat portion so small you do not even taste it.  When I asked about the three thin slices on my sandwich I was told \"that's corporate policy\".  Needs customer service training."}
{"text":"Food is always great! It's always quick and fresh. The samples are a nice touch while you wait as well as looking at the fun items along the shelves! Definitely a new fav place :)"}
{"text":"I just love this cafe! This location is near Mesa Community College at Red Mountain so I meet my daughter for lunch often. The atmosphere is great. It has big windows with nice views. I like to make my sandwich order, whether it's full or half a combo that adds soup and a drink. The Butternut Squash soup is my favorite. They also have samples at the cashier of pastry. I have tried the best sweet I have ever had! If you need a gift stop here..not only can you get a cute basket of goodies, but they have a mini CB type retail section that has cute little gift items and seasonal decor. Can't wait to take advantage of their outdoor seating. Did I mention the deuce thru?!!!"}
{"text":"Searching for a cost appropriate location for a late breakfast, Kneaders popped up.  I had been to a Utah location last year, and thought I'd give it a try. O M G ... I'm so glad I did!  It's right close to the Costco in that area, as well as to a ton of businesses, with easy access to the 101, Pima, and Frank Lloyd Wright/Bell.    4 of us for breakfast.  One ordered the Cheese, ham, and egg croissant, one a ham and cheese croissant, another the endless french toast, I ordered the Italian omelette, and we shared an almond croissant and a raspberry pastry.  EVERYONE was completely satisfied with their food.  My omelette had enough filling in it that it filled me right up.  I had a taste of the french toast... my goodness - what a wonderful treat!  Service was prompt and friendly.  I looked at the various breads and deserts they offer - and was blown away by the variety and prices.  I will be back for some lunch soon!  I even took a catering menu and will consider them for the gathering at the house... free me up to visit with our guests!  I saw a to-go salad and even though I had just finished eating, the freshness of the product and size made me realize I've been missing a gem here in Phoenix!  Home run Kneaders!  Head on over ... you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"7:52am: owner speaking with customer, nobody at register  7:58am: owner nor anybody acknowledges us, there's 7 people in line, person and his daugher in front of me wait, continue to look around  8am- still in line, owner has been casually talking w/ customer on other side of counter/dining area and still, owner doesn't even communicate to us that he'll be with us shortly nor does he ask one of his employees to assist us. That's Customer Service 101, isn't it?   8:02am (10 minutes in line!) I finally ask him loudly bc he is about 10yards away if he or someone could help us and he replies with \"I'm with a customer so I will help  you all when I finish, OK?\" (with sarcasm)   So, the other 4-5 employees are tied up?!   All I know is that when I waited tables, I would let all my customers waiting that I would be with them shortly or have someone take an order on my behalf. The sad part is that Kneaders is quite nice with a huge selection of pastries. Too bad I won't ever go back there.   To have to wait 10+ minutes for coffee is absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"I am confused by the bad reviews. Great broccoli soup, bread, kids really liked their meals (chicken noodle soup & grilled cheese). Good quality food. Warm and comfortable and clean. Very kid friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches. If you love macaroons they are wonderful at this bakery. The raspberry bread pudding is also delicious. Yum-Yum!"}
{"text":"I've only tried 2 things from Kneaders, the Chocolate Chunk Cookie and the Snickerdoodle Bread, and neither of those things are any good.   The Chocolate Chip Cookie is dry and cakey. I tried this cookie twice a week apart thinking maybe the first one was a fluke, but it just turns out they don't make good chocolate chip cookies.   The Snickerdoodle bread smells great and the plastic wrap it comes in it's sticky to the touch so you'd figure it would be sweatband moist. It's anything but. Once you cut into it, you find it's dry and not flavor full, and feels like you're eating a bad gluten free slice of bread. Only the very top of the load is moist and has any flavor. I only bought this bread after giving it as a gift to a family member a week earlier who says it was good. After being disappointed I called my family member and they said that it wasn't good except for the very top and they were just being nice.   So 2 items tested twice each a week apart and both no good.   A rule of thumb, if the cookies aren't good, then nothing else is.  2 stars because the store is nice inside and the staff was friendly. However I will never get anything from Kneaders again."}
{"text":"Good salads. I usually call ahead to pick up through drive thru. Today they tried to make me pay over phone first. I'm driving, hence calling it in. I can't get my CC while driving. Wouldn't let me order. Had to wait in the slow drive thru. Pple don't like places that go out of their way to be inconvenient. Other than that, decent food."}
{"text":"Was at this Kneaders yesterday. Lived in Utah for years.  Completely love Kneaders.  Used the drive thru. Service was good.  Salad was pretty decent for Kneaders. Good chicken fresh avocado, decent sized portions.  Ordered large, so deserved that.  However my daughter ordered a baguette as her side.  Worst, smallest sized portion I've ever seen at Kneaders or elsewhere.  Thing was a large crouton!  Disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Good eclairs. The \"benches\" and eating are about as comfortable as city bus benches. Oldies music bleh.  The food is very good though. Surprising that there are no take away menus."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I love the decor and the atmosphere, it has a good vibe. We went for breakfast today, I had the bacon, egg and cheese crossaint and it was delicious.  I also tried a raspberry cream cheese crossaint the other day we ordered food from work and it was so good, so fresh. So far I love everything in this place. I will definitely come back, plus I am so glad is so close from home. :)"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best salads in Phoenix and their selection of yummy sweets is incredible.  I got the turkey/bacon salad with ranch.  It's loaded with fresh turkey breast.  I also had to indulge in the key lime tart.  So good.  The service was great and they have my favorite iced green tea there too!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First visit here...was nicely greeted by Patty who took my order and was just very nice and took pride in her job.  I ordered a Turkey BLT with Avocado on a Croissant. It was very very good. The turkey was actual real white turkey breast taken from an oven roasted bird and hand pulled into nice size chunks. Very flavorful and tender. The croissant was freshly baked earlier in the day. It was not a flakey crispy one but more of a doughy bread style. Ripe slices of avocado and tasty bacon strips were both quality just like the rest of the ingredients used. For a quick yet quality sandwich, I would come back based on this experience."}
{"text":"I thought this place was only soup and sandwiches. We had never been here so we thought we'd give it a try for an early lunch. To our surprise, they serve breakfast! I had an egg, sausage and cheese on a croissant with an orange juice. He had an egg, bacon, and cheese on a croissant with a coffee. We both had a side of fruit.   It was all delicious!! I can't wait to go back and try their French toast, pancakes and delicious looking pastries!! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken Cheese Ham sandwich was the bomb! They also had so many pastry selections for dessert. Love their honey mustard and mayo combination. We're gonna keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Don't forget to order online!  Ordering was easy, showed up to see a line of customers waiting to order (lots of love for Kneaders), but no waiting for me, food was ready right on time and the Chicken Pesto Panini was delicious!  We decided we will order online, even when we are going to dine in; no lines for us when we arrive, our order will be ready when we arrive.  Great new store, close to home, can't wait to go back--breakfast tomorrow?!!"}
{"text":"Why did they close? I love it here!! Pretty disappointed. The food was amazing and the staff was kind. I will miss the soup and bread the most."}
{"text":"Ordered the Kneaders French toast and it was delicious! One of my favorite items because well the syrup is out of this world! Custom service was excellent! Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  They have the best bread in town.  The salads and sandwiches are huge and all made with fresh ingredients.   The desserts are fantastic..especially the brownies."}
{"text":"I had the Reuben sandwich and it was just okay for me;  It was a little on the skinny side. I don't see myself returning back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch during their opening week. Whoa, not sure I've ever seen (or thought possible) a sandwich place to be so busy. Waited patiently in line to order, got the turkey artichoke I believe, on focaccia and also the tomato soup.  I got VERY lucky and snagged a table that was still dirty but since it was the only one in the entire place I didn't care.  I got the food quicker than I expected considering how busy it was.  The sandwich had good flavor, but I wish there was more to it.  It was more bread than anything else.  The chips that came with it, or that were supposed to come with it, were just crumbs mixed with cheese.  I wondered if this is what they were supposed to be like, but looked around and saw people eating actual chips so I figured I just got the bag of crumbs at the bottom of the barrel. :(  Also the soup was just OK.  I loved the little retail section which has a lot of cute, unique items for sale (which could be dangerous while waiting for your food!).  The service was friendly, and I think I will give them another chance in hopes that they just need to work out some kinks after the initial opening."}
{"text":"My mom and I came in for the first time! We had a great experience! The cashier was friendly and gave us a few recommendations!   We shared the turkey bacon avocado salad and the turkey artichoke panini! They were both SO GOOD! We also got a kids sugar cookie for my son and the lemon cake! The cake was light and fluffy and the lemon filling was amazing. Reminds me of a lemon meringue pie filling!!   Loved looking around at all the cute home decor and such. Kind of like a little boutique! Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I had the Ruben sandwich the it had good flavor but almost no meat. It was so thin that I almost sent it back.  Also they need to add cashiers the line was way too long."}
{"text":"We have been going t Kneaders since it opened.  Their food is fantastic, but a little over priced. Every time we have gone there, the majority of the tables have NOT been cleared off and are filthy.  I dont know or understand why this is an on-going problem.  The sandwiches, french toast (the best I have ever eaten), and desserts are dangerously wonderful!  You can count of spending no less than $11.00-and up for lunch with drink and dessert.  I just wish they would bus their tables after each customer!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for kids, it's fast, good soup and good PBJ and grilled cheese. My kids love this spot, I'm a regular customer."}
{"text":"This location may be new, but they are definitely pros!! Drive-thru service is quick and I was able to get GREAT REAL food and back to my morning without a fuss."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time recently and I was pleasantly surprised! I am so happy to have a drive through cafe close by home instead of just McDonald's or Wendy's! The staff was super friendly and the food was pretty good! I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and that came with small side salad and my two year old got a grilled cheese. The sandwich was great! I just wish they hades a few other veggies to the salad isntead of just the lettuce lol the grilled cheese was excellent!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Kneaders for breakfast. The all you can eat French toast was delish!  Very filling, in fact I couldn't take advantage of a second serving since I was full. Will be back to try the other yummy breakfast, like the sourdough pancakes. Great place to carb load after a long run. Wonderful service and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Loved the Turkey Avocado Sandwich. The portions a huge and the sandwich could be shared. The service is always great no matter which location I go to."}
{"text":"Well, I must say I'm thoroughly disappointed. My family decided to stop at Kneaders tonight after seeing a movie. We came in around 8pm and the staff was already trying to close things down even though they don't close for another hour. They only had 1 soup available because they were putting away the other soups. I ordered a half grilled cheese and cup of tomato soup, my daughter got a chicken pesto panini, my son got a French dip and my husband got a bread pudding. My grilled cheese and soup was fine but nothing out of the ordinary. I would have preferred a different soup, but oh well. My son enjoyed his French dip. BUT my daughter's \"chicken pesto panini\" was terrible. Very little chicken. NO pesto, only with, disgusting, grey-colored basil leaves (which she picked out). It wasn't even a panini! Just bread that was maybe mildly toasted. For$9?! A rip off. My husband and I ordered coffee which they had to make because they didn't have any. I also tried a gingerbread cookie and it was terrible. I'm sorry we went in."}
{"text":"Closed on Sundays!!  What?!?!?  No!!!!!  I love how close this place is to my moms, since  I'm there quite often.    Things I always get:  Chunky cinnamon bread  Chicken pesto panini Turkey artichoke panini  Fruit tart  Almost crossiant   For the paninis I would prefer more meat as they are kinda cheap with that.  It's more bread than anything.  The paninis does come with some fresh Parmesan kettle chips and homemade pickle slice.    I love the cinnamon bread but wish I could get it plain and have the frosting on the side.  They top the bread with frosting and it melts and the plastic wrapper gets all nasty and super messy.  It would also be nice if they can cut the bread as well.  Me cutting is a disaster.    The fruit tart and crossiant are good, nothing over the top.  They have a drive thru and some kind of rewards card.  You just gotta ask at the store.  They also have an app where you can place your order for the next day, not same day until they updated it recently."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing. I just moved near one so this is crazy. I constantly crave it. I had a sandwich and I think some kind of bread and/or salad. I don't quite remember. But I can't wait to go back. I definitely recommend it. :)"}
{"text":"When you walk into the restaurant you see all the breads which looked very impressive and the knick knacks which also looked impressive.  Unfortunately the food was not impressive.  My husband ordered the pastrami and it came out cold so he had to send it back.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which came on a croissant with a salad.  I changed the bread type and when my sandwich came out it did not have the salad.  When I asked for it the person behind the counter said if you change the bread you do not get the salad.  When I told him that the person who took my order did not tell me that his answer was that he did not wait on me.  I asked for the manager and he said he would give me the salad anyway and I told him that the staff needs to inform the customers of things like this.  Don't think we will be going back there."}
{"text":"Pretty neat place, had some time. Had french toast for breakfast. It was great! Very thick, so it's going be very filling. It has a little gift store inside, reminds me of Crocker Barrel. Need to come back and try other things."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have been living near Kneaders for so long without stopping by. Now I try and go a few times a month. It is pricey, but to me the homemade goodness and freshness of their food makes up for the pain my pocket feels.  The staff is bubbly and friendly and happy to help answer my questions about the menu. Each time I have been the line to order is almost out the door which give you time to ogle the pastry case and add something sweet to your order.   I love the decor and the large windows throughout. There is also outdoor seating, but it doesn't have a buffer from the parking lot so I don't think it would be very relaxing to sit outside and eat. Plus it is near Craig Road which is loud. So stay inside and enjoy the fireplace and the warm atmosphere.  Besides serving soups, salads, pastries, desserts, salads, breads, and breakfast items-- they have coffee, juices, hot chocolate, smoothies, and tea.  Kneaders has a frequent diner card that will earn you 5% back on every dollar you spend. You can mix and match baskets/gift boxes with popcorn,wines, breads,pies, cheeses, etc that can be delivered or picked up. Kneaders is in 8 states- so keep a look out for them while you are traveling. ( All locations are closed on Sundays)"}
{"text":"Best gift baskets! Lori takes your budget and makes beautiful baskets! I use these for my clients welcome home baskets. They are each one unique !"}
{"text":"Food is very good but they don't know the concept of fast food. Takes way too long to go through the drive-through."}
{"text":"My family and I have loved Kneaders for a really long time, long before it came to AZ. However, this location is run very poorly. Inconsistent door quality, long waits for food even when the restaurant is not busy. Today we placed and paid for an online order more than 30 minutes before we showed up to pick it up and they hadn't even started making it when we arrived. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great breads if you go in the morning when they are very fresh. Most other food is average. Service is pretty good. Staff seems very cheerful."}
{"text":"I've been trying to visit this place for a little while, and now I did, I ordered a salad and it was DELICIOUS. The place is also really cute and I am totally going back for breakfast another day because the pastries looks pretty good! #LFTHX"}
{"text":"Usually go to Starbucks drive thru next door but because of their long lines decided to try Kneaders but ended up being in line for over 10 min with only 2 cars in front on me. Not to mention it's more expensive for average quality. Need to staff better in the mornings."}
{"text":"Tried this place again to give it a second shot. Ordered turkey artichoke on foccacia PANINI. Don't know about the rest of the world but a Panini is supposed to be served hot. Where do I begin the sandwich was cold for goodness sake the cheese in the sandwich was not even melted it was just placed on top like it came out of a refrigerator. The presentation is horrible. I have bread that's broken and super hard. are you guys serious?? Who gives there customer a sand which where the bread is ripped and like a brick and cold when it's suppose to be served hot! And you guys have  the nerve to put the two pieces that are broken off on top? Good restaurants would give you a whole- non ripped presentable piece of bread that is fresh especially if you want to be known for your baking. A sandwich that should be served warm should be warm, not served cold!!! Are you guys on a budget? Not to mention I went through drive thru. I was the only vehicle but yet I waited over 15 minutes for this. For a broken sand which that must be expired. I am utterly disappointed in myself for trying to give this place a second chance.  And p.s you guys need to seriously work on the people who work at the drive thru counter. He girl kept trying to hand me someone else's order and there wasn't even a car behind me!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The smoothies are delicious and the two sandwiches we tried (chicken artichoke and the french dip) were really outstanding. Super excited to have this little deli near our house, especially with a drive through that is super fast."}
{"text":"Took me way too long to post this as I've been going here now for a couple years I don't know about other locations but seriously guys there is no reason to go anywhere else as far as baked goods and breakfast. You simply are not going to get a better pie or pastry anywhere else. It's amazing considering how affordable this place is how high the quality is. Also I have gotten many unique gifts for family here, they have a really cool aprons, jewelry & odd items provided by local vendors. Even the orange juice is fresh squeezed they do not cut corners here. The chocolate cream pie is the BEST in the valley. Was just in here this morning and had the best veggie omelette with their 9 grain bread which honestly taste like a dessert in itself even though it's healthy. The taller gentleman who wears the glasses I'm not sure if he is the manager or the assistant manager he is so fabulous."}
{"text":"When I walked in I didn't have a high expectation of how this breakfast will turn out. My husband decided to pull in the parking lot to try this new place instead of going to paradise bakery down the road. The breakfast section is rather small so ordering was simple. I ordered sausage, cheese and egg breakfast sandwich and a cup of coffee.  After I paid and sat down I  realized they didn't ask what kind of bread I wanted on the sandwich.  That's ok. It'd be a surprise. Lol. I had a cup of dark roast from the beverage counter. It was, to my surprise robust and very fresh. It did not have that 'it's been sitting since 6 this morning' smell or taste. It was actually a good cup of coffee.  Sandwich was fine. Nothing to write home about except it was piping hot with freshly fried egg, not microwaved or ready to microwave frozen stuff.  The sandwich came with a fresh croissant which was buttery and tasty. Overall this was a pleasant surprise and the price was right. If you are in for a quick, hot breakfast this is a good place to stop in. Oh there's a drive through as well.  I did notice they had a good selection of soups. I'm looking forward to giving them a try on my next visit."}
{"text":"Let me start with something good.  The quality of the food was good.  Asiago Bisque soup was very tasty.  Got some cookies to go, they were pretty good. Now the rest.  The girl had to go over the order three times (2 sandwiches and 2 soups - not hard) and it still came out wrong.  My wife's sandwich had provolone cheese on it (she asked for no cheese), my sandwich had an unknown cheese on it (I asked for provolone), my sandwich had ranch on it (I asked for mayo - hate ranch).  The slices of bread for the sandwich are large, but the rest of the sandwich was skimpy.  It looks like a lot of food, but there is hardly any meat on the sandwiches.   So, it could be much better if the people that work there actually paid attention and cared about the customer service."}
{"text":"Well I gave them another try last night do to family pressure.  Again the food was good but I went through the drive thru, the guy ahead of me pulled out stopped parked and went back in.  So I thought \"check the order\". Sure enough they hand me my order and close the window.  I roll forward and realized I had no #5 Blueberry Smoothie.  So I pull out park and go in.  There sits my smoothie on the counter.  I point at it and the girl hands it to me and laughs and reply's oh yeah!  Come on get your act together !  The owners obviously need to take an interest in their business.  Good food but poor help behind the counter."}
{"text":"Yes there are better breakfast options to be found in the area (LGO, Matt's, Snooze, Breakfast Club, etc...) but Kneaders is half the price.  Also hard to argue with all-you-can-eat french toast for $6."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Kneaders and I didn't know what to order. The cashier recommended the chicken pesto panini. It was great. The food arrive quickly and tasted amazing. I'll definitely be back for lunch soon"}
{"text":"Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich was very good. So is the chicken noodle soup. We had oatmeal cookies which were also very good. I had the pomegranate berry iced tea... Little bit different but overall I like it. Lastly we had the cream cheese raspberry pastry one of my father's favorites."}
{"text":"Came in with my friend and 3 young kids for breakfast. First off, the food was great.  Some ridiculously good french toast and one of the kids had a breakfast sammy that looked amazing! Next, the staff - friendly and helpful! Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is growing on me because I really like the French toast. The syrup they serve is liquid heaven. Can't speak to the rest of the food, however, because I haven't tried anything else yet since my last review other than French toast."}
{"text":"I had not heard of Kneaders and I'm okay with having not heard of it until now. It reminded me greatly of Panera Bread with the exception that Kneaders has a drive thru.  I ordered a half size turkey bacon avocado salad one day and a whole turkey bacon avocado sandwich the next. I preferred the sandwich, however, the turkey on the sandwich was at a bare minimum. The bacon helped compensate the lack of turkey and I liked the taste of the Kneaders sauce. My salad was missing its dressing so mom shared her extra raspberry walnut vinaigrette dressing from her whole size chicken raspberry nut salad. The sandwich was of adequate size but the half size salad left me hungry even after consuming the complimentary rosemary bread.  Kneaders was decent enough to try a couple times but it's not something I would seek out if I lived in AZ. Drive thru was pleasant but not quick. I wouldn't appreciate the wait if I were limited on time, e.g. lunch break. I recommend ordering a whole salad over the half size and check for dressing before leaving the drive thru. The whole TBA sandwich appears to be of better value, compared to the chicken salad sandwich or french dip, because more ingredients and size is larger. Overall, Kneaders was alright."}
{"text":"Went inside this time. Gentleman working register must be a manager or should be. He was amazing in explaining everything, knew the menu, and such a sweetheart! My husband, who has never ate here, had soup which he loved and I had soup and sandwich.... amazing! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about Kneaders over the past few months and was excited to check it out for the first time. My co-workers and I went for lunch and didn't have to wait in line long, even right around noon during the week, which was nice.  This was a company lunch, so the boss paid after all 6 of us had ordered. The girl behind the counter taking our orders seemed perturbed that there were 6 of us ordering and made a snarky comment to the boss (something along the lines of \"I'm not even going to repeat what everyone ordered because you won't know if it's right anyways\"). I did like that they had free samples of a few of their breads at the checkout counter (even though I didn't have any).  The portion sizes were ok - the Chicken Bacon Avocado salad I ordered was mostly lettuce (a lot of brown pieces), with a small sprinkling of bacon and 2 slices of red onion. One of my co-workers ordered the same salad and it was missing the bacon. Also, the bread on the side (sourdough) was very good, but it was a little weird that there was no butter or toppings for the bread, just kind of a random slice thrown on the side of the salad.  Overall, the attention to detail and quality control here seems sub-par, but I would like to come back and try it again for a second round since it seems like it has a lot of potential to be a good place."}
{"text":"This a good place to come to when you don't feel like fixing dinner, need to eat on the run,etc. And you won't feel like you have completely blown it by eating out! Also a great place to get a a basket made for the workplace, party, Housewarming,etc. Any basket is bound to have something for everyone to love no matter what their taste. That's what makes it perfect there is something for everyone But it's also not too personal so it"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the restaurant/cafe chain, Panera Bread. It has the same flair to it and both offer savory and sweet treats.  I came here with my siblings for a quick stop to pick up some pastries. We tried their mint brownie, cheesecake brownie, sugar cookies, and white chocolate & cranberry cookies. They were all pretty good. If you purchase 5 or more pastries, you get 1 free!  I wish I tried one of their savory menu items, but we came here right after having dinner. We just thought it would be great to grab some dessert, since we were in the area. Their menu had a list of soups, omelets, and breakfast sandwiches. All the more reason to come back!   Another great thing about this place is that they give you the option of making your own gift basket. If you check one of the photos I have posted, you'll see the section where you can pick ribbons, boxes, baskets, and other lil things to make your own gift set. They also sell random trinkets. So cute!  This establishment sits right at the intersection of Craig & Tenaya, and is right across the street from a Starbucks. It's great for those who are just bias to having coffee from Starbucks. These two businesses are an awesome pairing. lol  I will be coming back to give their other menu items a try, and will be updating this review very soon!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent during the busy lunch hour! Food was fresh and delicious! Didn't have to wait long! So glad they opened a location in East Mesa!"}
{"text":"We saw the place being built and were hoping it would be a good bakery close to our home.  Well...meh....  It wasn't really bad, but it was nothing special (and over-priced).  We got two loaves of bread, and even though they were supposed to be very different they were pretty ordinary.  We didn't try their sandwiches, so can't comment on that part of their offerings.  But we like the bread at Great Harvest, and Whole Grain bakeries better.  And they're less expensive.  Disappointing because both those places are a lot further from our house."}
{"text":"I feel in love with this place. Great food. Amazing breads. The deserts to die for. So excited I was turned on to the place."}
{"text":"I love fresh baked goods. I always get a veggie sandwich everywhere I go but I didnt like the taste of the harvest veggie sandwich. Thats okay though. I put all the fillings in my potato soup and ended up dipping the bread. It ended up good like that actually. I wouldnt order that again but I would come back again to try anything else.  The desserts and pastries look amazing. Its conveniently right off the freeway which I love."}
{"text":"First time trying Kneaders. Great customer service and pastries. The manager was super sweet. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Kneaders.  The first one was so busy that I decided to forgo a review till they got their staff trained.  Tonight my wife and I went in for dinner and some desserts to take home.  We started out by getting over charged and then after getting that straightened out all our food came out in to go packaging.  What can ya do right?  So we unwrapped our food and dug into what were supposed to be these terrific sandwiches.  My wife's was a chicken salad on a croissant which contained virtually no chicken and a large pile of water chestnuts.  She took it back and they gave her another sandwich which contained the same water chestnut salad but on the wrong bread.  After complaining again, the manager really seemed to care less.  Sigh...  My turkey sandwich was nothing special  although the dirt on the lettuce was a special twist on an old classic.  I didn't even feel like speaking to the manager one more time  as by this point I was just ready to get out of there.   From reading other reviews it appears Kneaders did a terrible job of hiring any staff that are willing to pay attention to food quality, and their customer satisfaction policies are non existent.  Ron P's story about being told to bring back a salad so they could replace it was hard to believe but I believe it now. Good luck surviving in in Gilbert Kneaders.  Your chain bakery competition is leagues ahead of you. Oh, they do get one extra star as the desserts we took home (keylime pie, and canolli) were quite tasty and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Was a little reluctant to eat here after some of the reviews but had lunch with a friend here today and we were very happy with the place. I had the turkey, avocado and bacon sandwich on focaccia bread and it was delicious. I love all the baked goods on display!  The place was very busy but we got our sandwiches right away and we were not disappointed. Will definitely eat here again to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Been here twice first time the house French toast was too sweet to eat .had to leave it . Management needs to do some serious training. On both visits , employees appear to not know there roles very well"}
{"text":"Great service.  Love the drive thru option.  Their croissant breakfast sandwiches and raspberry croissants are my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Thus was my first time going to thus new bakery in Surprise, AZ. It looks nice when you walk in but then it happens... Something's really reunited the moment. I spent $10 for a piece of cheese cake and a tart for a special valentines dinner. When I get home and looked the cheese cake it looked like a pit bull attached it. I was SOOOO disappointed. I waited 17 minutes for them to package up something that's not edible looking, see my picture attached. I had to throw it away, I could never of used it for such a special day. I went to Fry's grocery store, spent $9 for a whole cheese cake."}
{"text":"Great service, fresh and delicious baked goods and sandwiches are yum!!! The price for sandwiches is a little high but the taste and quality is great."}
{"text":"I don't get the allure of this place- it's basically fast food. The tuna sandwich is missing something... like the tuna. It's basically thick bread with a slight tuna smear."}
{"text":"Love that you can order a great salad and soup through a drive thru. And on top of that, the drive thru customer service is fantastic. Bread and pastries are amazing. Breakfast is also very good. The pancakes were awesome and they give you a lot. A real nice addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The spring time tulip flower sugar cookies were a huge hit with my three cuties. My turkey bacon avocado sandwich was delicious. The employees were so helpful and friendly. I was so happy with the fact that there are tons of high chairs and super clean bathrooms. My older daughter said, \"Mom this place has everything!\" #lfthx"}
{"text":"Cute little place, my mom took me here after raving at how good it was. I don't mind waiting in a decent line-seeing previous complaints I would say there is ALWAYS a line but they're decent at moving it along. I got a kick ass Reuben panini and broccoli soup, good stuff and quality ingredients but I could get the same at Panera or something similar. I do prefer smaller local restaurants so I would still prefer this place. My mom is a bit on the scatterbrained side so the next part could be slightly blamed on the confusion she causes: we ordered 20 specialty cookies and after our food was delivered we were told they were set aside and ready to be picked up on the way out, along with some hot Irish soda bread-unfortunately one of the younger, more frantic looking food servers decided to sell all 3 boxes to someone else while we were eating and the same server snagged the other half of my sandwich and tossed it while I was in line waiting for my now nonexistent, already paid for cookies. When they disappeared everyone seemed to look around at each other in disbelief instead of giving any real explanation.  Poor counter girl looked frustrated with her younger timid coworkers when we explained what happened and offered all she could while doing what I refer to as \"facepalm,\" haha. They ended up boxing up some fresh baked cookies for us within minutes instead of having to refund us, minus any real apology. I would still definitely come back because it's a cute atmosphere with awesome baked goods and treats. My cinnamon, white chocolate, caramel apple saved the day though, given my sudden interest in every caramel apple offered in Phoenix! I would recommend still giving this place a try but keep in mind that it seems like they are not quite a well-oiled machine, not much communication going on back there it seems. For such a high-volume, busy place they should really get everyone on the same page so someone less patient and understanding doesn't flip out over some damn four clover cookies. ;)"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. However, I can't give them the fifth star because we ordered a French dip and it only had a sliver of roast beef on it. It was tasty and the bread was delicious but  almost no meat."}
{"text":"Couldn't find the place because it was just in front of the church on 75th Avenue. Very pleasant inside and nice atmosphere but voices can echo inside and drown you out when you're trying to have a conversation. The staff is very friendly and courteous. The presentation of the pastries and various Bakery items they have in the display window by the cash register is very nice. I was disappointed to find out they do not have anything sugar free. My wife and I got the all you can eat pancakes. Was pleasantly surprised to see if they served it with a warm maple butter syrup and also strawberries in a whipping cream. Try them both and it was very good eats. I was supported that the next course on the all you can eat french toast was a little bit dry and did not come with the strawberry and whipped cream accompaniment. A nice breakfast and a good place to stop in once in awhile"}
{"text":"Always a lively crowd there friendly staff and delicious food/desserts. As usually I got my French dip on a baguette and this time I got the chocolate brownie omg sugar rush but it's so delicious #lfthx #organicad"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the breakfast sandwich and the ice tea. Overall the price was worth it and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I would definitely come back and try the all you can eat French Toast."}
{"text":"Super expensive.. No combo options only add ons. They messed up my order and took forever to fix it. The bakery items were good but not worth everything else. We won't be back.   Just before I posted this I asked where my fixed salad was and the manager refunded my card since it took so long so that earned an additional star. Still won't be back."}
{"text":"There is a Kneaders by my work that I go to a lot so I was pretty excited when this location opened. I have been to this particular location about 7 times and it's very disappointing. The employees need a lot more training. The food just isn't up to par with other locations. I just left there with two turkey sandwiches and a salad. There was almost zero turkey on the sandwiches and they didn't give us dressing with the salad. Mistakes like this happen every time I go. I know it's not Kneaders since their food is delicious, this location just isn't taking their time to make the food like they should be."}
{"text":"Salads are amazing and do are the smoothies. The entire staff are very pleasurable. Prices aren't very expensive either."}
{"text":"First time here was a good experience.  I've been twice since and notice the staff always seems frazzled.  They are either behind on orders or out of soup or something along that line.  Overall though, the food is very good.  I've had really good sandwiches (love their french country sourdough bread) and their chocolate sweet bread is to die for.  I would definitely recommend coming here for sandwiches and that fabulous bread."}
{"text":"Everything I have ordered, I have loved! Tonight I ordered the turkey cranberry croissant,  but the French toast is my personal fave.  Definitely get there before 11 to try their breakfast if you can!"}
{"text":"Love love love. Sandwiches, bread, bakery, soup all so tasty. I usually get the veggie avocado with soup... so delish. Service is fine, you order and they drop it off at your table, nothing to it. One of my favorite places in Surprise. They are far better than paradise bakery."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and we were impressed! Super friendly staff.. very clean and cute inside. Food was delicious! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered ham and cheese on rye. The bread at Kneaders is noticeably fresh and delicious. They are quite skimpy with the ham. The \"dressing\" they put on the sandwich is very tasty but quite strong and would recommend asking for it on the side to make sure you like it. They only have one size cup for iced coffee which was very small but the coffee was good."}
{"text":"This bakery is phenomenal!! The staff is always amazing and I'm a regular!! Ethan and dezarae are hands down the best employees Kneaders has. Keep up the great work. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We love coming here for breakfast and lunch. Great service! Best coffee. Really cute gifts. Super clean!"}
{"text":"We ended up walking out... We wanted to grab some dessert and had picked out about $30 worth of stuff for our family of 4 when SLAM, our 3 year old did a face plant on the unmarked wet floor, which we didn't realize till my wife went to help and she fell too. When my wife suggested they put up a sign, the kid mopping said the bucket is the sign, but it was around the corner. He continued to argue about how he did everything right and we were stupid for not seeing the bucket. We would've been ok with everything but the attitude of the kid who said he was the manager really upset us... So we decided we didn't want to give these people our business and left. The guy is a complete jerk up to the second we walked out, will never come back."}
{"text":"Too expensive to be a regular customer. Food is top notch.  Very quiet and clean.  Once and a while visit due to the price"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up to Kneaders and our SUPER friendly cashier Mary!  Ordered the Roasted Red Pepper Gouda soup and a Pepper Grilled cheese.  They both were excellent!  Tried the orange sweet bread and my husband was in love!  Will be back to try breakfast!"}
{"text":"Agree with previous reviewers. Excellent food, especially the cinnamon French toast but review the check before you sign it."}
{"text":"Tried this place for breakfast. First timer and we will be back! Finally found an excellent breakfast spot close by. The food is phenomenal but better than that is the customer service. Chris is absolutely outstanding. He will brighten your day and make you feel like you're a regular. Every business needs a Chris. His level of customer service is superior."}
{"text":"Cute little place.  The have a few loaves to sell but mainly a eating place.  Great deserts and they have a few soups to choose from.  Great if you are a soup lover like me.  Also have gift baskets for foodies and cooks.  Mostly country style."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Bad experience two consecutive visits. First time we paid more than $20 for two sandwiches. You could hardly find the turkey on the sandwiches. They seem to count on their bread being good and forget that to make a \"sandwich\" there needs to be something other than bread. Terrible value for the money. This morning we waited ten minutes in the drive-thru only to get the wrong order which we didn't discover until we were home. I tried to call and allow them to make it right, but after five minutes on hold I gave up. There are very few non fast food options in our area but we will drive to a better value from now on."}
{"text":"I would have to say that they have the best French toast that I have ever had. There is not much else i can say other than you owe it to yourself to go there and try it. I think you will agree."}
{"text":"Totally dig this place. Pastries are fresh and not overly sweet.  Try whatever they have pumpkin, really legit. The French toast is probably one of the best I've ever had! The portions are good....not to small but just right.   This place does get busy but the drive thru is very efficient. Recently ordered 1 pumpkin loaf, and they gave us 2 free, because the manager said he didn't like the way the other one looked. Looks more like a mom and pop shop, with a cracker barrel feel.  Everyone is friendly, and welcoming.   Some other visitors must have caught them on a crazy day, or with new untrained employees.  Been here multiple times and satisfied with all visits so far."}
{"text":"I love kneaders so much! My only problem is I can't get my husband to eat anything else  the desserts are amazing though and I'm happy they have some gluten free options"}
{"text":"Wayyyyy overpriced. With all the competition in the area I'm surprised they're still holding it together.   As for bakery items- their bread is really tough and almost always dry. If you want fresh bread, the drive out to the bakery on Southern and Val Vista is way more worth it."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location once. It's mediocre at best. I would definitely give it another shot. Wasn't impressed with the salad, sandwich or chips. Ingredients didn't seem fresh. I did, however, like their desserts and bread."}
{"text":"I finally decided to stop by Kneaders for the first time the other day, it only took me like 2 months! I went through the drive-thru and the first thing I noticed was that their drive-thru is ridiculously slow. They are really going to need to step their game up on that because that is the fastest way to lose business, nobody wants to wait 20+ minutes in a drive-thru line! Anyways, I ordered the sausage and egg croissant, turkey artichoke panini, orange rolls, and the caramel macchiato. The sausage and egg croissant and turkey artichoke panini were amazing! The orange rolls needed some work though, they tasted a little doughy. The caramel macchiato was unbelievable, I still can't get over how much better theirs is v. Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!  We love their chunky cinnamon french toast and the turkey cranberry croissant!  Great, real food for the whole family!"}
{"text":"Went in at 2:30 on a Tuesday and the service was SLOW despite having very few customers inside or in the drive thru.  I ordered a salad with no cheese and it came out covered in cheese. Pesto panini had very little pesto and was flavorless. The portions were small for the price. Several dirty tables throughout the indoor dining room. We were going to try cookies but after waiting for what felt like forever for the one customer in front of us to be helped I gave up. Save your money and drive down to Wildflower."}
{"text":"I don't know why there would be a single negative review of this place! It was awesome! I was hesitant because of the ratings I saw on Yelp, but we were hungry for breakfast, and in the area, with not much else around. It. Was. Wonderful! The girls at the register were super friendly and helpful (and even had free samples of muffins and scones, and let me try both :). They happily answered all our questions, very knowledgeably. Then, because we had so many questions, the line started getting longer behind us (yes, we were THOSE people), and they immediately opened up another register when they saw this happening. The iced coffee was very good and they offer many syrup flavors - both regular and sugar-free - to make it even yummier. Now onto the food. I ordered the Greek omelette... SO GOOD!!! Even the toast on the side was perfectly toasted and lightly buttered (although I do wish they had told me it had butter on it, or just put the butter on the side). My husband got a croissant breakfast sandwich, which I tasted, and it was good as well... And the cinnamon roll... OMG. Get it heated. So dang delicious! Unfortunately, we don't live close to there, otherwise we would have definitely been back! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Lunch - food was ok, not bad, not better than Panera or others, though. Prices are much higher, I expected better quality when spending $35.00 on sandwich lunch for 2 people."}
{"text":"First timer, it is in the top 1% and they offer samples of the soups. The cost is okay particularly if you split a sandwich. $$"}
{"text":"Been here before & loved their chicken salad sammie on crescent. Barely tasted the salad this time. Got lots of romaine lettuce and water chestnuts besides the crescent but I doubt they used 1/4 cup chicken salad. And we must have gotten the bottom of the bowl, the salad was runny and dripped all over the plate making the crescent somewhat soggy. Will look elsewhere for such a simple sandwich. Won't be going back again for what they charged us and what we got!"}
{"text":"The service wasn't too good. They didn't stock up the beverage area (out of straws and tea). The soup wasn't hot, thought it was a bit over priced."}
{"text":"Kneaders is a \"Yay! I'm a fan\" for me, but sometimes the service is a little more like a-ok. I'm not sure how I haven't managed to review them yet! We've been frequenting this location since it opened. My family loves the desserts as well as the food, and my husband and I have even gotten the breakfast croissants a few times (get it with bacon!). I love the club sandwich and my husband get the turkey and avocado. My favorite meal is to add chicken noodle soup and a fresh squeezed lemonade, and tonight I even paid the $1 to add avocado (which is just a crazy price to me, but everybody screws you on the avocado) and it was delish. My favorite dessert is the double fudge brownie, while my Mom loves the sugar cookies (and my Dad always snuck them when she brought them home). My husband has tried a different dessert just about every time we've gone there and his only complaint is that a lot of the frosted items have too much frosting. Like I said, every now and then the service isn't that great. The drive thru is always slow, but it's not fast food. To be frank I don't know why they have a drive thru. At any rate, we are fans of Kneader's and I'd say definitely give it a try if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Tried this place that a coworker said was tasty. He did not lie. This place is great. The sandwich was great as was the soup and dessert. I will definitely be coming back to Kneaders. Their menu looks amazing."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent! The guy taking the order was very informative and knowledgeable about EVERYTHING on the menu. The croissant was VERY fresh. Best I have ever had. Balsamic dressing was amazing too. House parmesan chips were to die for and I am not even a CHIP person! Got alot of BANG for my BUCK. Will be back!"}
{"text":"First time and was empty impressed with the presentation of the Bakery goods. Seemed reasonably priced. We sat at a booth near a large party with a few kids. They made quite a mess. When the girl came out to clean after them she had no broom or mop.  She proceeded to wipe the tables off with a cloth, leaned over and wiped the floor with the same cloth. She ended with one more wipe of the table with the same cloth. I then noticed there was a line to get drinks and they had run out of ice. A guy came out and jumped onto the counter with his street shoes and disappeared to the kitchen with a tub of ice.  He didn't fill the machine.  Instead he left the tub with a scooper for everyone to serve themselves. These were two reasons I will not be back. If  they not concerned about cleanliness in the dining area I suspect the kitchen may have concerns to me."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now and it has not let me down. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is clean and the food is wonderful. We went on a night that Santa was there and our two girls were so excited. Santa was so kind and you can tell he truly loved what he did! I know that's not something you'll see every time you go to Kneaders since it's just for the holiday season, but it was nice to see the Kneaders found a Santa who truly loves bringing joy to families."}
{"text":"I don't ever want to eat any other bread ever again. The focaccia that the turkey, bacon, avocado is served on is SO SOFT AND AMAZING. I'm in literal heaven and will be thinking about this bread for the rest of the day. The turkey wasn't dry, the bacon was crunchy, and the produce was fresh. Bonus: no line at lunch time on a Monday!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed today. I read your article in the West Valley View which stated this special for Grilled Cheese Day  only they tell me I have to have it on my Facebook I showed the ad and I got the advertised price but got a grilled cheese and no bacon no tomato no special sauce. I didn't find the staff paticularly friendly."}
{"text":"Y'ALL I cannot recommend this establishment enough! I got a French Dip with Bbq sauce per the cashiers recommendation and it was delicious. The friend I visited with was also wildly impressed with her sandwich. Our desserts were off the charts delectable 10/10 would return! Also A+ for customer service all the employees were incredibly accommodating and kind. My only issue is that they're not open on Sundays, I want to eat here every day of the week."}
{"text":"Well a few things were messed up a bit but other than that I was happy! This place was a lot cuter on the inside that I had expected! I liked that it was like a little shop. They were selling a bunch of different little holiday things when I was there today! Although everything was a little too pricey in my opinion. One complaint is that they only list the item name on the menu at the counter. I know there is the paper menu too that's more descriptive, but that would've been helpful. The desserts on display looked amazing, the chocolate mousse dome looked especially incredible. One thing that definitely earned points with me was that they were giving out huge samples! Like I'm talking full slices a bread. A bit wasteful as I didn't finish mine but dang it was good. They had multigrain hazelnut bread, snickerdoodle, and pumpkin. The snickerdoodle almost tasted like cake, I loved it! For my meal I ordered autumn bisque soup with quinoa salad with baguette bread. They gave me ciabatta instead of baguette but it looked good so I just ate it and didn't get it fixed. My dad got a sandwich and he didn't know it was going to have mayo on it and contained onions. So he had to replace his sandwich bread with my moms ha. But overall we were all satisfied! The soup was very delicious, was a vegetarian butternut squash soup. The quinoa salad wasn't amazing but wasn't too bad. The bread is definitely the best thing here, yum!"}
{"text":"This place has a bad wrap but I've only ever had good experiences.  If I forget my lunch, I'll stop in on the way to work for a coffee, croissant and a salad for later and I pay $12 which I think is reasonable for breakfast AND lunch.  One time I did get someone else's order by accident but I still enjoyed it so it wasn't a total waste."}
{"text":"We ordered A birthday cake for our daughters Sweet 16 Birthday. We had never ordered a cake from Kneaders before so we were excited. It was the Raspberry Cream.  The cashier said it was one of the more popular cakes. It certainly looked good in their beautiful display case. We also ordered some of their mini bundt cakes.  Those were good.  We picked up the cake on Saturday and Unfortunately when we got it home which is about 3 miles it had slid off the bottom layer and was completely ruined. We had even put it inside a cooler for the ride home. This is the only reason they're getting two stars. Everything else, the service, the taste of the cake was excellent. But the looks of the cake  was less than appealing."}
{"text":"It's a lot like Paradise Bakery, but in my opinion, better.  My daughter and I ordered broccoli cheese soup and sandwiches. The soup was great and came with our choice of bread. We opted for sourdough which was pretty good.  The sandwiches on croissants were tasty.  The desserts all looked really delicious, but we chose the cannolis... and they were just ok. I'll go back and try a different dessert next time, because there is a great looking selection.  Definitely worth trying for fast and fresh food and maybe some decadent desserts.   Also, it's nice to support the locals."}
{"text":"This is by far the greatest kneaders I have ever been to! The staff was super friendly and helped so much with what to order. I got the cream of broccoli soup with asiago cheese bread and it was absolutely delicious! The bread was so soft and fresh and the soup came out HOT! I also ordered a brownie for dessert and it was so moist and actually tasted homemade. This franchise is definitely doing much better than some of the other kneaders I have been to and absolutely blew me away 10/10"}
{"text":"I have been before, but today was the last straw.  Met two friends for breakfast and coffee.  My cinnamon roll was delicious.  However, both of the coffee urns were empty.  My friend informed cashier and she said it would be 5 minutes.  15 minutes later, one of the urns was refreshed.  One friend had to ask for condiments for her breakfast sandwich and both had to ask for cutlery and napkins - met with a sigh from server.  Went back for coffee refill and - guess what - coffee urn was empty again.  Informed cashier AGAIN.  They pulled both coffee containers.  We waited 35 minutes.  They never did get filled - the dark roast coffee was never filled the 1.5 hours we were there.  Gave up in frustration and left.  Please don't sell coffee if you do not intend to have it available."}
{"text":"Well first of all, the food is fresh and the staff is lovely. So I went there about a week ago intending to get a brownie and walked out of there with three different brownies, two cookies and a sandwich. I got the Turkey Bacon Avocado on Focaccia bread. It was amazing!! The next time I went there, I went through the drive through and got the same sand which as well as the Chicken Cheese and Ham on Ciabatta roll. When I got home I looked at the TBAF sand which and it looked really flat compared to last time. It was missing the bacon, avocado and the cheese (not to mention they couldn't have been any less generous on the amount of turkey). I decided to take it back to get it remade. As soon as I walked in the manager (I'm assuming) greeted me instantly and looked saddened to see that I was walking in with the food. He immediately called out to get it remade for me and it took maybe all of 3 minutes. Maybe the lesson to be learned here is to not go through the drive thru and to always check your food before leaving. Great service great food. Can't really complain about anything! So glad I live less than 5 minutes away. Totally my go to place for quick healthy food. (PS the chicken cheese and ham came out fine I believe if you were wondering)"}
{"text":"I work for a doctor's office right down the street from kneaders. We occasionally have pharmaceutical reps come in for lunch meetings. We have had issues both times. Both times we call our order in and explain that the rep will pay for the meal. Both times our reps have called to pay for the meal and kneaders didn't have the order after we had called it in. This of course causes chaos since we are so close to our lunch meeting and we can't extend the meeting otherwise we would be late to see patients for their appointments. This particular time however upset us the most. The stated that they didn't have any record of the order even though we had called it in 20 minutes prior and confirmed with a girl named Jordan. When the rep called the restaurant they stated that no Jordan worked there. The rep was dealing with a girl named Laura or something similar to that name. So our office called to figure this mess out and we talked to an Angela and miraculously she found the order however it had not been prepared. She said it would take an additional 30 minutes and by this point the order should have been paid for and on the way to our office. We could not wait for the food to be done otherwise we would start our afternoon clinical later than expected. So we cancelled our order. Kneaders has good food but the fact that this has happened twice to our office is a little ridiculous. They either need a better system and get organized or they need more competent employees."}
{"text":"Well, been to Kneaders a handful of times since this location opened. GREAT food, terrible service. Today while in drive- I was greeted by a rude employee- not a friendly voice.  When I got to the window, I sat there for 4 minutes until someone came to the window and gave me my total... Not even a hello, good morning or apology about the wait!!!! I then had to wait another 2 minutes for my drink and daughters kids meal. I was told there was a straw for her drink in the bag, when I asked... Only to realize when I left, Nope no straw!   I also ordered a cinnamon roll and I didn't get it!   Wow- not a good experience at all!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this Kneaders.  Their salads and desserts are top knotch.  However their consistency is lacking.  I ordered the same salad 7 weeks in a row and it was made correctly with the correct dressing, ingredients, etc only 1/7 times."}
{"text":"Tried this week and it was packed at 2:30 in the afternoon did have to wait 15 mins to order but if a place is busy it is worth it usually and they are new too and Insee why it was popular.  I tried the turkey artichoke panini and  the bread was delicious good quality ingredients, real turkey not processed and the homemade  Parmesan chips on the side and a delicious chocolate chip croissant in a combo   I think I'll go back again and give it another try maybe shoot for smoothie and breakfast and see if they can earn a 5 star"}
{"text":"Place is always crowded at lunch,  long lines to order and trouble finding a place to sit. You have to hover around people who look like they're almost done---I hate doing that. Food is about what you'd expect. Better than Panera, about the same as Wildfower and Paradise. Like that you can have a good salad , not sure it's worth waiting so long for though."}
{"text":"Horrible drive thru...it takes for-EVER...I just ordered a non dairy berry smoothie and waited in drive thru for 17 minutes...there was only one car ahead of me...geeze...I'm not coming back here...this is my second time ousting drive thru and the first time took just as long and all I ordered was a salad...they really shouldn't have a drive thru..."}
{"text":"I really wanted a brownie and all my places close early so I did a google search and found Kneaders.  They are open late and don't close till 9 or 10 so that is a plus on my end.  They had a lot of bakery type options to choose from.  They were not great but not bad either.  I got a cream cheese brownie - not great, kind of tasted like a fairytale brownie.  The cannoli was soggy and had the citrus flavor which I really don't care for.  My son got a chocolate dome thing that was just ok and my husband got something apple that he said was pretty good.  They didn't have pastrami which is my go to on a sandwich so I got a ham.  It was ok, the sauce was pretty good.  My son's tuna didn't have much tuna on it and was also just ok.  I may be back as they were not bad and are open late.  I would still rather go to Berthas if they are open though but they close way too early.  Another plus was that the total for 3 sandwiches and 4 deserts came to only $37.00."}
{"text":"New location on 75th Ave, just north of the 101. Had a good experience here. Easy parking. People were very friendly. Dining area was clean. Counter service. They bring food out to the table. Self-serve soft drinks.  Kneaders is similar to other chain bakery/sandwich joints, but they seem to do it much better and with more varied bakery selection. I saw pie(!!!), cake, eclairs, Napoleon, cookies, and more!! They had me at the bakery. My husband really enjoyed his sausage, egg, and cheese croissant, and carrot cake. My chicken pesto panini came with parmesan potato chips and a pickle. Decent sandwich. Also got the banana cream pie. Loved the banana slices and pudding part, but thought the \"cream\" top was a bit heavy. Wasn't normal whipped cream, but more like a shortening or butter base. My husband liked it though. Got a rye loaf to bring home and made some great sandwiches for dinner.  3.75 Stars for the great service/atmosphere and tempting bakery case. Looking forward to trying more menu items."}
{"text":"For this area, this is a great place to get breakfast, lunch or a dessert. Their breakfast croissant sandwiches (egg, bacon/sausage, cheese) are melt in your mouth amazing. French toast is great, too! I like the berry dairy free smoothie. I like the turkey cranberry croissant sandwich for lunch. They have great desserts too. My favorite is the carrot cake and I am normally not a carrot cake fan at all. I love that they have seasonal trinkets and gift wrapping station. PLUS, they have a drive thru :)  My only hang ups are: 1. They are closed on Sundays 2. Their loaves of bread go bad fast. 3. Service can be slow after 7pm."}
{"text":"Kneaders is legit. Their signature collection is love. Everything is made like they were making it for their most favorite person in the entire world. Their sandwiches are like when you were a kid and you swam all day and your mom called you inside to eat, yeah they are that good.  They have tasty desserts, pies, cookies and my all time favorite, is the loaded baked potato soup bowl. Eating that soup is like sitting in front of the fire and being bundled up and watching your favorite movie on a chilly day. If you are looking for that meal that reminds your mouth of home and good cookin, then run to Kneaders. It's just good, fresh, made with love eats."}
{"text":"Poor Service but good food.  Soups, sandwiches and French toast are outstanding.  The service is very poor, slow and not the sharpest knives in the drawer.  We ordered our second helping of all you can eat French Toast and after 15 waiting asked about it.  Bad Attitude Matt said they are busy (with 1 person in line and 1/2 full tables). He said he will put in order again.  10 minutes later..still nothing. Asked again and finally gave up and left.  Other great sandwich places to go to, will not be returning to this Kneaders (had great experiences at other Kneaders)."}
{"text":"Always delicious! On Wednesdays they prepare a chicken enchilada soup that is amazing!  You can get a bread bowl and bowl of soup for $5.  This place is quickly becoming my favorite sandwich/soup place!"}
{"text":"My go-to deli/bakery in the top of eastern area! Always super fresh ingredients from they Barbra's to their vegetables to their specialty desserts. Highly recommend trying the turkey bacon avocado sandwich. It is rather large but so delicious that it's worth eating half and taking the other half to go. At time the wait to order can be extensive. I do understand since it's such a quality spot just be prepared to wait. Would be giving 5 stars but being understaffed can be annoying when you're in a time crunch. Ultimately a huge contribution to the area offering quality breakfast and lunch items!"}
{"text":"I had the pesto chicken panini it was good. French toast was good too. Small serving of fruit. Had a yummy latte, was a good morning. Not a restaurant feel."}
{"text":"While the Reuben sandwich was good, it was underwhelming. A few slices, very thin sandwich and basically $8 something for it.   There are other sandwich places out there with more to them. But the taste here is ok."}
{"text":"Okay so yeah ...BREAD like tons of it and it's so GOOD! I mean soup in a bread bowl holy cow don't take your gf friends they won't stop staring at you while you devour the goods! My fav is Asiago soup or their turkey sandwich on a croissant mmmm so satisfying!  Staff is helpful, cheerful and patient. Drive thru helps if you feel lazy or you're on your way somewhere and crave a somewhat guilt free meal!"}
{"text":"Tried the 3 sandwiches. Turkey bacon avocado, chicken panini and French dip.  All were excellent. Cookies chocolate chip, oatmeal and peanut butter w/chocolate chunks all were the best. Lavazza coffee fresh and good.  I would give them 5 stars but they forgot the potato chips."}
{"text":"Great quality of and offering of food with excellent prices.  This is the place to go to pick up your holiday rolls and pies.  Best variety of soups and sandwiches for the picky eater to the health wise.  They also serve breakfast and coffee.  Not open Sunday is the only thing I dislike."}
{"text":"Very clean, great food! Loved the order online option! Order online before I left the house and then picked it up through  the drive up window. Very fast that way, no wait!"}
{"text":"We have visited this place a few times, and have cut them some slack the first couple as they were very newly opened. After a couple weeks, they should have their stuff together.  Unfortunately, they can't seem to find their backsides with both hands.   The food is good enough, but customer service is terrible!  I even went to the Kneaders website to share my frustrations (similar to other Yelp reviews) and haven't received even a courtesy response.  It appears like a great concept, but they won't be around for long performing like they do now.  There are too many other places with similar concepts that seem to care that you want to share your money with them. Kneaders is a big disappointment!"}
{"text":"the salad was good according to my partner. no real arguments there. fresh lettuce it seemed and all other ingredients ok. I had the french dip sandwich....first of all one does NOT juliene cut a sandwich like this..or panni it....makes the bread hard...one slice of poor quality beef??? really? and the dip was SALT PURE SALT...terribly salty...ugh....we can get a better salad anywhere and a better french dip also...never go there again..once and done"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place it was a love hate relationship. We used to get their sandwiches but they kept globbing mayo all over it, as other posters had stated ( picture below).I decided I was going to start saving pics since it was so frequent. I liked the authentic quality I could get for lunch at a drive through instead of regular fast food,like an awesome salad or something  more healthy. These are some other problems I have 1.they always forget forks 2. The food is assembled sloppy to an unedible point sometimes 3.I highly question their sanitation practices. I have so far received a bug in my salad? Do you wash your produce please?!!Why return..you'll just give me another bug salad. Another time I returned my sandwhich that had a blonde eyelash in it. Yes,I have good eyesight. Also when I returned a sandwhich one time because it had only one piece of meat rolled up in a ball they took it even though I bit off it,put more ingredients in it and gave it back to me. How do you bring a bitten sandwhich back into the kitchen and play with it.With that unsanitary logic I have seen I  doubt the chef changed his gloves before making the next guys sandwhich...ewwwwe!Not worth the wait in line or price."}
{"text":"Best oatmeal EVER. Never thought of putting cranberries and coconut together but it was a treat!  Crunchy French Toast was decadently thick, the scramble was too tasty!  Great selection of teas and expresso drinks.  Great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Kneader's raspberry nut salad is wonderful. A definite healthy and yummy choice. Their bread is always fresh and delicious. A great choice"}
{"text":"You have to be patient here. I've been here three times and every time, they've been super slow. Maybe they have high turnover but they seem to be in a constant state of hiring. The food itself is really good. I recommend the chicken noodle soup and any flavor smoothie."}
{"text":"Every time this place is good , I really love walking in and seeing all the goodies and craft stuff ."}
{"text":"We just stopped on for treats, but my daughter got the kids meal; she got the PB&J. We had the cannoli, chocolate some,key lime tart, and a strawberry cupcake. Everything was great! Service was excellent. The restaurant was clean, and tidy. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Needed a place to grab a bite to eat and get some work done. Was very surprised to find out they don't offer WiFi.  I ordered a sandwich & soup combo. For the price you pay, the taste was mediocre at best.  They need to understand what a salad is and not lettuce shoved into a cup. Also when you use lettuce for a sandwich, don't use the hard core parts.   The bakery looked appealing, but the comments from the people behind me said it looked much better than it tasted so I opted not to get any.   The environment is cute and they have home decor for sale, but I can get the same items at Hobby Lobby for half the price.   This will not be a place I will jump on going back to anytime soon."}
{"text":"Best tuna sandwich ever! Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Manager Jonathan is awesome and definitely knows his customer service!"}
{"text":"If I were writing a review solely on their pastries and freshly made breads it would be much easier to give 5 stars since they are the true gems on the menu. I have been by a bunch of times now ordering both inside and the drive-thru. The employees have been very friendly and willing to answer any questions I have about the menu. One thing you might want to do is check out the online menu for this location because there is much more offered there than on the actual menu board in the restaurant and you could be missing out on something delicious by not even knowing it's offered. They slow roast turkeys at each location and hand-pull then each morning for sandwiches and salads. I have had several things with the turkey and it tastes so good! Sometimes there is a wait for your order, but they are making things fresh, so I don't mind.   Banana Cream Pie French Toast ($6.49) - Get this! Sliced bananas and almonds with whip cream and a delicious caramel syrup stop some of the tastiest french toast you'll ever eat. No joke! They use their Chunky Cinnamon Bread loaves, sliced thick, to make the french toast here. I previously had the Chunky Cinnamon French Toast for $5.59 that came with sliced strawberries and caramel sauce and it was great, but the banana cream pie is so much better! If you don't see it on the menu board in the restaurant, just ask and they will make it as it's on the online menu.   I was able to make my french toast a combo #2 for an additional $5.39 which gave me a pastry and a smoothie. I chose the Eclair and it was soooo good! The smoothie I chose was the Morning Sunshine Smoothie, with Orange juice, non fat vanilla yogurt, strawberry and banana was actually not as good as I'd hoped. It was a bit bitter and didn't live up to the description. I also had a Cafe Mocha for $3.99 on another visit and it wasn't anything bad, but it wasn't great either.    Turkey Bacon Avocado on Foccacia (8.49) - Some sandwiches on the menu are available on half/whole sizes, but not all of them. This one comes whole and it was by far the best thing I've eaten on the menu here! The bread was so fresh and tasted great, the turkey was slow roasted over night and hand-pulled fresh that day and had a little salt and pepper added which I loved. They put a decent amount of fresh avocado on the sandwich and there was also provolone cheese, kneaders sauce, red onion, lettuce and tomato making for a very tasty sandwich. I'll absolutely be ordering this one again.  Provolone Muenster Cheese Melt ($6.69 for whole) - This one you can get as a half or whole sandwich. This sandwich has 3 layers of Three layers of french country sourdough bread, yes you read that right. Muenster cheese, provolone cheese and fresh pesto butter are melted in between and it really hits the spot especially on a cold or rainy day. For $2.99 you can make it a combo #1 which gives you a cup of soup to dip your sandwich in. Mentioning soup, it changes daily so check their website or ask when you are ordering what's offered that day. I've had some hit and misses with the soups. You can also get your soup in a bread bowl, score!  Pastrami Sandwich ($6.99) - This was terrible. I know this isn't NY or L.A, but come on the veggies were fresh and the bread was good, but the skimpy, flavorless pastrami they had on there was a joke. I'm amazed that call it a pastrami sandwich and that it doesn't compare in size as well flavor as some of their other sandwiches. If this sandwich was my first experience here, I'd have probably never came back, so I am glad I had such great previous experiences to avoid that.   Chunky Cinnamon bread ($4.59 for a loaf) - They also sell many of their breads by the loaf and this one happens to be the one they make all their french toast with. The price is very fair for what you get and it pairs so nicely with milk, coffee or tea. Ask for a sample they usually have a few different kinds out for customers to try.   Frequent Diner Card - It's free you just have to ask for one and then register it online. Give it to them each time you pay for your order and you will get 5% back on every dollar you spend that builds up and can be used towards future purchases."}
{"text":"Food is great, clean place and nice staff. Gave a 4 because they take forever. The line got so long with only one register open. Gave me anxiety when ordering because I could feel the people behind getting annoyed. Left the first time I was there because the line took soooo long and my lunch hour was being eaten up. Second time I went through the drive thru which was not bad. Third was tonight. They really need 2 or 3 people taking orders on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I gave them 1 star because, i placed an order for a cake for my husband's 40th birthday . I provided a picture of the cake that i wanted , very simple yet elegant and perfect for a guy his age. Gave specific details that i wanted a thing layer of filling . Long story short, the cake came out to be a disaster!!! Nothing like i wanted and nothing like i asked , not even close to the shape and design!!! So i didnt have the time to pick up another cake or place an order for another one. So i had to go to michaels and target and get cake decoration to make it look more proper and presentable. The cake basically was floppy made , frosting was uneven! So thank you for ruining my day !    I prefered if they called me and told me that they cant do it the way i want , i could of came in and we could of worked on something that at least will satisfy my desires."}
{"text":"Yum! The wife and I had a wonderful dinner here last night, We ordered a Bread Bowl with Potato Soup and a French Dip, both were delicious. We had a bad experience at another location but this one seems to have their act together. Good Job and we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has really good food. It's a little overpriced for what you get, but it's good. The employees are friendly and helpful. It's usually pretty quiet and not very busy."}
{"text":"Deli-style ordering at the front of the restaurant.  This place serves good pastries at mid-range prices.  They offer goodies for the kids too."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait for this place to open since I pass by every morning. Unfortunately, they don't open until 7:00 which cuts out a huge portion of morning commuters - including me. I decided to be late for work today so I could try them.  They offer free samples to taste while you wait which is nice since it seems to take a long time to get anything. One was something chocolate filled and the other was some sort of berry filled. Both were dried out I assumed from sitting too long (they had just opened) or that is what they do with their day-old stuff. For some reason they both had a bitter lemony flavor.  The $2.79 cinnamon roll I ordered was very disappointing. I could see a fresh batch sitting on the pastry cart but the one I got must have been yesterday's leftovers. Dry like the samples and very little cinnamon or icing. It also left a disgusting yeasty taste that doesn't wash away with 2 cups of coffee.  At first I was surprised at how few customers were there at 7:00 on a Friday morning. Now I understand. They need to step up their game or this place will be closed."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new Kneaders out since it is fairly close. It's brand new, so it was clean. Line took quite a while from the door to ordering. Staff seemed unorganized and tables are not cleaned between customers. At our table we had two French dips and one panini sandwich. They all tasted good, but the filling was pretty skimpy. The French dips had a small amount of tasty, but dry roast beef. Since I'm able to get a really good sandwich in the same parking lot at Firehouse subs, I probably wouldn't get a sandwich there again. Also ordered a loaf of sliced rye bread which took a long time to appear. I don't think they were waiting for it to bake and I can't imagine why it would take that long to slice. On the whole, it was just OK."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want a good fresh sandwich....totally knocks all the other places out of the water. The soups are very good (broc and ched) and the cookies are amazing. I am a huge cookie monster!! NOM NOM NOM!!!   You will see a lot of Romney's and Osmonds on some night ;)"}
{"text":"The salads are plentiful and nutritious.  French dip had scarcely an ounce of meat and small cheese slice, but plenty of bread and dipping juice.  Chicken  Tortilla soup---OK.  Éclair most disappointing.  Doesn't taste fresh and is filled with more than \"natural\" stuff.  Switched out for one of the chocolate mousse items.  Same experience.  Those desserts are made to last in that refrigerated case for a loooong time."}
{"text":"Basically repackaged version of paradise bakery. Food and environment are similar, menus are similar, quality is similar. Price is also similar which is too much for what you get."}
{"text":"I first heard of Kneaders bakery from my sister-in-law. She said first had a taste of them in Utah. She knows I love Panera Bread so she said I would really like this place. I was thrilled to stop in and check it out for myself. Their grand opening was today and they were offering free cinammon toast until 11am. I love that they have a drive-thru. We went around 12:30-1pm and the line wasn't too long only about 5 minutes. We bought lemon blueberry bread, fruit tart, peanut butter cookie, and a scone. It only cost about $20 for eight items--not bad! As we were waiting they had a few retail items to look at such as aprons, glassware like mugs and other cute dish ware. We were able to sample Some cookies and a mini coconut cream pie tart and s chocolate eclair. They have a lot of delicious sounding pastries as well as a variety of breads to choose from. I was sad that they were out of the almond croissant. So I'll return back earlier for that and to try their breakfast. They also serve sandwiches, soups, and salad. Happy that this location is on the northwest side of town."}
{"text":"I love that they have a drive through that serves real food. Who doesn't want a salad or soup without having to leave their car?  I've been here once. I had a Coke Zero, which was truly terrible. Their mix is way off. This cost them half a star.  I also had the Al Mondo salad. It was very good. Fresh ingredients with well trimmed chicken. No flabby bits. No weird seasoning blend (like Panera uses on their chicken).  I didn't want the sweet dressing, so I got ranch dressing instead.   The salad came with bread and I chose country French. This is basically sourdough sandwich bread. Boo. They also didn't give me any butter. The bread was nothing to get excited about, which is too bad at a place called Kneaders.   The service at the drive through was great, which I appreciate.  Edited - I noticed that their ranch dressing is not that great and I got a couple of bites of flabby chicken. Their bacon has an artificial, chemical smoke flavor but it is otherwise good.   I think it's really more deserving of a 2.5 star rating, not 2'"}
{"text":"I like Kneaders alot.  I usually go to the one on the way to Anthem.  But was over here.   The vibe is the same.  The people were nice, and my salad was delish and fresh.  I usually don't get anything sweet, but the have a cookie that is thick, and has a lot of chocolate chips, and I think it had a brownie bottom on it.  It was so good!  I had to get a second one and bring it to my husband."}
{"text":"Ordered online for dinner and arrived figuring our food would be ready.  Seemed to be some confusion with an online order, but they quickly filled our order and we were on our way. Sandwich and salad that we tried were yummy and staff was very nice.  Super quiet in there at dinner time.  We will definitely go back and try other options."}
{"text":"YASSSSSSS! I am so excited to finally have a Kneaders in Las Vegas! This place is a hidden gem I frequent when I stop in St. George, Utah and I have been saying I hoped one had opened here for years. Finally, a girl's food dreams have come true!  We stopped here to grab a few things from the drive-thru and the line was not bad at all. There were lots of cars in the parking lot but plenty of space to get around to place our order.   We ordered the roasted vegetable panini, the grilled chicken sandwich on focaccia, the three cheese cauliflower soup, an ooey gooey bar, a fruit tart and a loaf of honey wheat bread.  We didn't have to wait too long for our order and everything was organized and correct and the girl who gave us our order was sweet and professional.  We came home to eat a feast! Everything was just like I remember it in Utah and all delicious. I love the grandmother's kitchen feel of their dishes. The fresh bread, homemade soup and delicious desserts. The veggie sandwich was so good! Zucchini, mushrooms, roasted red pepper and ricotta all layered on toasted bread. The ooey gooey bar was my favorite pick. Butterscotch chips, chocolate chips, coconut, caramel and layered shortbread, I wanted two!   We will return to you Kneaders! Thank you for making your mark in LV!"}
{"text":"The French toast and fruit tarts are TO DIE FOR. I've only been disappointed once (dry cinnamon roll bread...meh) but everything else on the menu is pretty great. Love that it has a drive thru too."}
{"text":"I was somewhat unimpressed with my order after stopping here for dinner last night.  I ordered the roasted turkey sandwich on ciabatta and my dad ordered the french dip. We both ordered the roasted red pepper soup and the berry bread pudding to share.  My sandwich had absolutely no meat on it. Considering it was put on a ciabatta which is a larger roll for a sandwich there just wasn't anything substantial about the filling. I also asked for extra cranberry since the spread they put on wasn't a spread at all.  My dad's sandwich had the same problem, not enough meat to bread ratio.   Our soup was barely warm... soup is supposed to be hot. It's hard to eat it when you are concerned that you might get sick from an improper temperature.   Our bread pudding was just ok as well. It didn't seem to be cooked long enough and the sauce they drizzle it with was barely noticeable.   I have always loved Kneaders, but I feel like they need to stop skimping on simple details and portions so that the customers leave happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is poor. We waited for over an hour to get French toast on a Saturday at 10am. The dining room was packed with hungry customers and only 3 people cooking in the back. When everyone asked why there was a delay, they were told they were out of many ingredients to make what was ordered. Unfortunately all customers in the drive thru were being served with no issue so this excuse was not a good pacifier. There ended up being more people in line to get a refund than to get food."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place and breakfast spot. The all you can eat French toast is money. Only like $6 for thick French toast with strawberries, whipped cream, and this warm butter syrup that is to die for. Sandwiches are solid too."}
{"text":"Rating solely on the food because I ordered through Postmates. I ordered the fruit tart, guava smoothie, salad and cauliflower soup.   Fruit tart: 4/5 I felt like there was too much of the filling and it was a bit too sweet for me.   Guava smoothie: 4/5 The smoothie was really good. I just wished the guava flavor was a little stronger.   Salad: 5/5 I'm not sure which salad it was but it had candied nuts and raspberry dressing. It had some chicken in it which I wasn't expecting but the candied nuts was a nice addition.   Soup: 5/5 The cauliflower soup was probably my favorite. I got it with some asiago cheese bread and it was really good. It was flavorful and filling but not too too dense."}
{"text":"After driving by this place a bunch of times, I decided to stop and grab lunch one day. I went through the drive through and ordered a chicken salad sandwich. The gal working the drive through had excellent customer service- you could tell she was trying. I wish the same could be said for who ever made the chicken salad. They add water chestnuts, I am assuming for crunch. Good idea if 80% of the \"chicken salad\" isn't made of water chestnuts. It was flavorless and under seasoned. Huge disappointment. Not sure if I got a bad scoop or if they are trying to cut cost but I will never order this item again. I'm hesitant to go back at all."}
{"text":"I am really happy to have this new addition to Surprise.  I have never eaten at Kneaders before, so I was a little hesitant (I usually feel waaaaayyy let down with sandwich spots, except for those few that are AMAZING... ie Dilly's, Niccoli's, and I really do love me some Jimmy Johns)  I was soooooo happy with my order.  I love the drive through, the customer service was outstanding, and the sandwich was reallllllllly good. The bread (hazelnut multigrain) really took the sandwich to another level, but the fresh turkey and awesome house spread (mayo mustard sour cream blend) were amazing already.  The filled croissant was great, like Cali doughnut/bakery great.  My order was under $8, I appreciate the half sandwich option, so I can add a pastry and not have too much food.  I can't wait to try their french dip and other menu options!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to have a French dip since i have not seen any shop offer this meal. The baguette was on point as well as the au ju. I wouldn't mind trying other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was truly homemade, I have been here 3 times so far and each time the food is great!!! I love the customer service as well as they homemade bread choices they have to offer."}
{"text":"Really craving there French onion dip and ordered online to pick up at the drive thru which is a nice feature they have ! The bread looked fresh and tasted fresh, but I was really disappointed in the amount of meat inside the bread. The flavor of the sauce was very plain did not seem to have any salt like at other places I have been to. Maybe next time the sauce and meat will be more fulfilling."}
{"text":"I was very dissatisfied with what was handed to me at kneaders today. For $10 you would think you would get more than just 2 tablespoons of tuna fish and a wilted piece of lettuce!!!"}
{"text":"I love the bread pudding and the soup.  But the prices are high, not open on Sunday, and I was not impressed with the breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a disorganized place that does weird things.  The food is excellent (if and when you get it) and employees are nice (although not generally knowledgeable).  I would not recommend this restaurant, although I still have hope for it."}
{"text":"Look out breadco, breads-pastries, soup salad and sandwiches.  Delicious and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Really disappointed this morning.  I normally come to kneaders once a week either for breakfast or dinner and overall have had fairly good experiences.  This morning however I went thru the drive thru and ordered 2 items.  BEC sandwich and Greek omlet.  In pulling up to the window I was greated and immediately paid.  I then sat for 15 min before my food was shoved at me.  The sandwich was for me since I'm pregnant and knew it would come with a fried egg fully cooked.  However I was wrong.  Almost half way thru my sandwich I realized over half the egg white was runny and not cooked.  I understand it was a busy Saturday morning but that shouldn't change the quality of food being served, especially when it could be dangerous to people who have specific diets to follow for health reasons.  I tried to call the number on my receipt to express my concerned and was instead greeted by and AA and not a person at the store."}
{"text":"I  love the food and ambiance! Just got my French Dip and my husband a Rueben Sandwich, we both love our orders. I actually asked for extra aus jus to bring home my half sandwich, that's how I loved it.  I like the Holiday decorations too, feels homey. I was salivating from the brownies and sweets displayed. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for what they offer. Their food is ho-hum at best. Their sole claim to fame is bread which is sub standard to Pannera."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through and ordered 4 sandwiches. One tuna and three turkey. The tuna amount was very sparse. Good thing the bread.tastes good because the sandwich is just all bread. For the money  they charge It is a rip off. The sandwiches are too expensive for what amounts to  2 slices of bread"}
{"text":"This became my Panera/Paradise bakery replacement yesterday.  The sandwiches are huge, the bread is crazy fresh, and the soup is really hearty.  I love their rewards program, they give you 5% off.  So much better than some of the stupide ones out there, Keeps it simple.  I've not had the chance to try the baked goods I saw, but the Raspberry crème cheese cake looked dreamy, and then there were the gourmet carmel apples.  Place is not super busy and doesn't feel like a factory when you go in, it has a bakery type feel.  They also give you two types of combos for your sandwich or salad.  Best yet, its costs only slightly more than Paradise or Wildflower.  Time for some Pie for dinner!"}
{"text":"I was literally interrogated this evening when I asked for the sandwich that Dustin the manager promised as a result of a previously horrible sandwich. They made me feel like a thief after to speaking to 3 separate guys. The sandwich was better. The treatment was embarrassing.    Email content-   You must not have written down my name. I am the one that drove by this evening and got my sandwich. I felt like I was being interrogated initially. The sandwich however was much better.

{"text":"The food and the to go service was very good. I had the French dip and my husband had the Panini pastrami. They were both short of meat and the pastrami had little sauerkraut. We will be back to check it out again."}
{"text":"The egg, ham and cheese croissant was super delicious!  No doubt this is what my daughter will order the next time she goes here, although she really liked her french toast!  Hubby could eat only half of his pancakes, so you know that means the portions are large!  I had no idea I was walking into a gift shop as well as a restaurant......I wonder how that concept will work."}
{"text":"Oh no! I have to update this review, because the quality has slipped. My first visit was when they had just opened up for business so they must have been on their best behavior. I ordered the French Dip again, and was disappointed to have hard, tough bread. They also skimped on the meat, which was okay since the meat was dry and charred on the edges. Not sure if they are going to keep me as a returning customer. I gave them three stars only because I have had fairly good experiences with their salads."}
{"text":"Not sure why we even bothered. The young staff is going to bankrupt this place. The young girls were clueless on the menu, rude and too busy chatting with friends instead of working. Combo's are confusing and not even the staff could understand. Order was wrong so we asked for a refund and went to Panera."}
{"text":"Very good salads and sandwiches but very expensive for what you get. Not sure if I would go back again!!! Lower your prices kneaders!!! Also they have NO half sandwich or half salad combo unlike corner cafe!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is fabulous here but the chicken always tastes like rubber and fake. It's gross. Do not order the chicken EVER"}
{"text":"I went here with my girls after soccer four times this month and they have never got my orders correct. For example I got a BLT. Just that nothing special and I got  onions and 1 leaf of lettuce. Then I ordered a turkey Avocado  Lettuce on a croissant and got turkey onions tomato no avocado. They are lazy and stupid and will never return"}
{"text":"We like the atmosphere here. Food is really good and great pastries. Great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is super bomb! I always get a salad. Turkey cranberry or the sante fe. Both are super good. Sandwiches are good too. Desserts are too expensive as not that good. But the peanut butter cookies are heavenly! Your welcome."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb!! I want to eat here everyday.  I ordered the BBQ chicken salad and not only was it super delicious but it was huge. The desserts are actually worth the price too. So good. Everything. You MUST try his place."}
{"text":"Best customer service around!! Never messed up my orders, and always has caring employees throughout the establishment. Have tried Panera down the road and nothing comes close to the quality and freshness of Kneaders."}
{"text":"I eat here more than I probably should because my wallet isn't a fan! But it is worth it every time. My favorite thing to get is a classic cafe sandwich and one of their many pastries! If you have an issue with your food, don't whine about it unless you brought it up to the staff first. They are always willing to help."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and usually the food is pretty good. But today I bought a Ruben sandwich, and it had less than half the amount of meat as normal.  Really, a very small amount of meat.  I've had this sandwich before, and it always had a nice amount of corned beef on it.  But not this time.  I decided to talk to someone about it, just so that they could be aware that something went wrong with their quality control.  The employees just shrugged their shoulders and said, \"sorry, you only get that much.\" They didn't believe me, and they didn't care."}
{"text":"This place is beyond awesome. We've had several different sandwiches, breads and lots of desserts loved them all. Oh and the coconut cream pie is holy mackerel delicious. Try it you won't be the same."}
{"text":"Ordered a 1/2 turkey sandwich and 1/2 chicken noodle soup.  Took a couple of bites out of the sandwich, wasn't tasting anything but mayo and opened it to up find that there was maybe about one ounce of turkey on the sandwich.  Why bother?  I posted a photo on the main Kneader's Facebook page and they responded with a stale \"thanks for letting us know, we'll tell the operations team at that location.\"  Uhm, how about you offer to reimburse customers or read the other Yelp reviews here showing the terrible food?  I'll never be going back."}
{"text":"Why ohhhh why do i come to this store...ordered a 1/2 sandwich and soup 35 minutes ago and I'm still waiting...this is the WORST store...when i have Time i literally drive 15 minutes farther to avoid this store!"}
{"text":"One register open. Late Saturday afternoon. We came to try their salads.  12 people in a line that is moving at a snails pace.  The baked goods were well presented, you notice this because you are looking at them for about 20 minutes.  The menu on the wall is vague.  It names salads but no descriptions.  What type of lettuce?  What type of dressings are available?  Is the meat flavored?  What is on the salad? We didn't want to ask questions as others ahead of us were and it took so long to get answers.  We took a gamble and each ordered two different salads and coffee. The coffee in the carafe must have been sitting all day.  I could have poured it on my wrist like testing the heat for a baby bottle and it would have been just right.  I couldn't get anyone's attention to ask for more to be made so I dumped my cold java and filled my cup with soda.  Tried to search for a clean table.  None.  they had been cleared, but not wiped.  Crumbs and smear on every table.  This was the same the entire length of our time there.  Trays were pulled off tables, but never wiped.   While you are sitting waiting for your food as an order comes up the \"server\" tromps through the aisles announcing \"Joe\" \"Joe\" \"Joe\" \"Joe\" \"Joe\"  until Joe raises his hand.  This constant calling of names to find the person who placed the order is ridiculous.  There is technology for that...Pagers, cards on tables, and so forth.  This constant calling of names adds to the noise pollution that comes with tile floors and marble tables.  This place is noisier than a McDonalds with a Playplace. The salads were ordered to eat in.  They arrived in a square clear plastic flip lid container like you would get at a grocery store salad bar.  They were very small in size ( smaller than a half salad at what I thought would be a comparable restaurant) and had no dressing options.  I didn't come to a restaurant to eat a skimpy salad with a plastic fork out of a plastic container.  I went up to get an extra napkin.  There was a worker moving the empty lemon container around (not filling it).  I kindly said excuse me as I reached for a napkin and she acted like I was bothering her. Some people may like the gift items they have incorporated to sell at the entrance.  If I want gifty items like a replica of my Granny's apron I will go to a nursing home Bazaar in the fall, or a cutesy gift shop.  This space could be better utilized for traffic flow.   This was 1 hour of my life and $21 of my money I will not get back.  I will not even give this place a second chance as it wasn't even a scenario of hitting a bad day.  They just have processes that just won't be remedied without a total transformation of policies."}
{"text":"Review is for AM Drive thru service only. First, no bagels?!? The place is called Kneaders and when I scanned the drive thru window menu, I was unable to find any mention of any bagels. When I asked if they had bagels I reviewed a short \"Ma'am we don't have bagels at this location, but we do have other pastries...\". I ordered the chocolate croissant and it didn't even come out warm! It left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Called in my order ahead of time for a pick up and they had it ready before I got there, it was great. I got the turkey artichoke panini and it was DELISH"}
{"text":"Been there 5 times since they have opened, which is almost daily. great food. The owner of this franchise was working the drive thru window and is very nice and young, i am guessing early 40s. Definitely worth every penny. Ill see you guys soon.Thanks again   Cheers."}
{"text":"I love how fresh the sandwiches are here and that they give you fresh baked parmesan chips with your sandwich. It's not just a lunch place though, they have a very tasty breakfast menu as well."}
{"text":"Used drive up window to pick-up 1 each brownie and cookie.  First, we could not understand what the gal said when she repeated the order and we think the cost.  Drove up to window and waited over 5 minutes for 2 items when the gal walked away.  Finally, she opens the window, handed over the goodies when we mentioned we could not understand her, the young immature gal rolled her eyes handed over the change (not in his hands) only to have our five dollar bill fly away.  Never an apology as she slammed the window."}
{"text":"This place is so good. We had turkey bacon avocado salads and sandwiches and the caprese salad. Everything was super fresh and delicious. The cookies are to die for. Definitely try the chocolate chip. The restaurant was really clean and the staff was quick and friendly! Can't recommend it more!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place to get good sandwiches. The bread there is so good. The only issue that I have with kneaders is that it's always so packed and there is never an open seat. They do have a drive they that is very quick so we use that In order to avoid the crowd. They have really good deserts too. I had a cannoli that was awesome."}
{"text":"My most favorite thing from Kneaders is their raspberry bread pudding. It is out of this world! My next favorite thing is the fact that they have a drive thru! Their sandwiches are always tasty too! Rueben, French dip, and their turkey artichoke are my favorites."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try. I was awake early and was craving some kinda fresh pastries. The guy at the counter was friendly and upbeat and had a good attitude right off the bat. He wasn't the usual sleepy, mono-toned, dead-behind-the-eyes teenager. I had a simple croissant and coffee. Sat in there and ate. Nice quiet atmosphere. But this was 6 ish, im sure it's zoo around 8:30. Then I was still hungry and wanted more. Dude suggested a breakfast sandwich which was awesome. So I had a good experience and I think the cleanliness of the place, the food, the great customer service....5 stars."}
{"text":"We went to Kneaders for lunch and it was great! We ordered the turkey bacon avocado sandwich. It was delicious! We also ordered a kids meal and my son wanted soup, which they gladly let me substitute his entree for that. They also let him swap out his sugar cookie for chocolate chip which I really appreciated because they said they normally don't do that. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was amazing! Girl at the cash register was really sweet"}
{"text":"I continue to come back to Kneaders for their awesome sandwiches and soups!"}
{"text":"I never thought this would happen to me, but it did. This metal S hook was found in a bag of Parmesan chips. We had a big group meeting at work today and lunch was ruined after I found it. Nobody wanted there meal after. Hopefully I don't get sick."}
{"text":"I am new to this café and still exploring the menu.  I tried lunch options a couple of times, but there are not a lot of healthy vegetarian items to choose from, so I frankly avoid coming here for lunch.  Breakfast offers a better variety but nothing so unique that I would want to make a special trip.  I do love the bakery items.  There is a large selection of freshly made pastries of good quality.  Everything is fresh and delicious. The pricing is reasonable.  Service seems to be hit-and-miss.  Some days you get excellent service and the staff is attentive and helpful.  Some days ... well ... last time I waiting for a good 3-4 minutes to be acknowledged by two staff at the register who were chatting away about someone who was not doing his job (the irony!).  When one of them finally turned around and noticed me, she was quite helpful, but then messed up my order (I was just buying two pastries, nothing super complicated) and it took forever to get those out of the case.  Overall, I would say this is a nice bakery, and an-OK breakfast/lunch joint.  Good to have as an option, but if they were gone, I would not be terribly sorry."}
{"text":"Love the food but had major issues with our online order. Used regular bread instead of croissant, chips instead of a side a Rosemary focaccia bread, waited 10 minutes in drive through with no acknowledgment. Server at window was very brusque. If you're spending $30 you expect more."}
{"text":"I have been going to Kneaders for years, starting in St. George, UT. I was so excited when this location opened up. Hands down, the best french toast you will ever have!"}
{"text":"I wish we had one in Chicago.  The food was excellent.  We had breakfast and took pastries home.  Everything was delicious. Very affordable.  The restaurant is adorable."}
{"text":"This place was packed for a Monday afternoon then again its new to the area. It's great that Kneaders chose this site to set up shop in an area that is lacking healthier options and variety. I didn't get the chance to try any lunch or breakfast items so I will be back to try the rest of their food. I end up taking my items to go because it was too busy. Being inside did remind me of a Panera Bread mixed with a bit of Cracker Barrel especially the retail section. The fresh and made from scratch bread & pastries were delicious. I Will be back for sure since its not too far away from my place. They do online orders and catering so call ahead or check out their website."}
{"text":"Love this place! I only tried it recently for the first time but I'm pretty sure I've been back at least 15 times already. It's moderately priced (similar to panera bread) but the flavors are better and the bread is amazing! I love the walnut and rosemary breads. Ordering a pie for Christmas so hopefully that is just as delicious as everything else! They also had a good range of kids' meals."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time. They wasted 30 minutes of my time in the drive thru and didn't even have my order put in when i got to the window. Needless to say i did not get to have lunch today because they had incompetent employees."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting this place to have such good breakfast. I ordered an egg, bacon, cheese croissant. It was made fresh and wasn't pricey. About $5. I got a fresh squeezed lemonade which was amazing. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to kneaders in a while, so I decided to go through the drive thru. I ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich. I was excited to get home so I can eat my meal and there was NO avocado and NO sauce on it. How do y'all have a sandwich with avocado in the name and not put avocado on it.?"}
{"text":"Seriously slow!   It takes about 3 weeks for me to forget how freaking slow this place is and then I go back and then I remember to not go back.   Pack a change of clothes if you want to eat here."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation, so glad we did! I tried the 1/2 turkey cranberry sunflower salad & cup of fully loaded baked potato soup with Asiago cheese bread. The salad & soup were fantastic! Turkey is very moist. I could have done without the Asiago bread. Also tried an orange roll..yum! I will definitely be back & I'm so excited for the NW location to open!"}
{"text":"Finally came by to try this location. Hubby had French dip, very good! Fresh, tasty, dip was good.  I had the turkey sunflower salad, 3 cheese cauliflower soup, honey wheat bread. My meal was delicious! Tried chocolate chunk & oatmeal raisin too. Everything was very good, including the service."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I order lunch every Friday for a group lunch so we can all eat together. It is nice when we find a place that lets us order online and then one or two people can pick it up and bring it back to the office. Well, this week someone recommended Kneaders - so we all ordered and I was so not happy with what I got.   My co-workers that went to pick it up said that the restaurant had no clue what order was what, and even though we ordered in advance, nothing was ready when we arrived to pick-up the food at the designated time. So -- it was chaos picking up -- and of course there were problems with the orders once we got back to the office.   I had no soup that I paid an extra $2.99 for.  AND -- someone in our group was missing ham on their ham sandwich!!    So - what I DID get was a soggy panini that was like mush in my mouth -- not worth $9 -- not even worth $1. And -- a super bitter pomegranate ice tea - which I would not recommend.   Overall -- feeling annoyed and hungry. Called for refund on the soup -- was offered store credit, or I could drive down and get my soup right now.   Not a happy customer. But all in all- it's okay, because we have OTHER OPTIONS!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake is sooooo good. It's really dense but still really creamy and has just the right amount of the berry filling. I've also tried the oatmeal raisin cookie and it was super soft. I didn't eat the whole thing right away and forgot about it. I went back to it 2-3 days later and it was still soft! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute rip off! Last time I ordered a chicken salad and it was nothing but lettuce!  I gave them another opportunity and ordered a chicken salad sand which. I received bread, mayo and scallions. Jan, the owner was non apologetic and said it's  all portioned out. With that info, I know this is their standard and will never return"}
{"text":"This is exactly what this corner Kneaded - McDowell & Power Rd.  Today we braved the opening day and the service was great.  They had the entire staff on board greeting customers they provided samples of their breads, desserts and sample drinks.  Although there was a line it was perfect opportunity to look at their bakery display, read the menu and look at all their beautiful gift baskets.  This was my 1st experience at a Kneaders and I was really impressed with the setup.  They do have a nice patio although it's facing west during the summer months the sun will be beating on you.  Plenty of seating inside and out to enjoy your meal. I thought one of the best deals around is for smoothies 16oz for 3.29 and they have quite the selection.  The only downfall I see is they are closed on Sundays.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm re-reviewing the Surprise Kneaders because it's service has dropped significantly. While I still like the food, the people now working there (they have had a complete turnover of staff) don't seem to know what they are doing. Recently, and on two occasions with two different cashiers, it took us telling the cashier our phone number (for the rewards program) more than 6 times before a manager walked over and helped the cashier enter it correctly. Not sure what's going on over there but I hope they get it turned around soon."}
{"text":"I think the place is great.  Only thing is that they are always busy unless you go at 7:30 in the morning.   I have a thing about good food, if it takes a few minutes more, that is fine, after all, I am here to eat.  You whineboxes that think it should be faster and think they should do this and that please try to get over yourselves.  It isn't a fast food joint."}
{"text":"The one star is for a few of the breads and the chocolate zucchini muffin tops which honestly if they did not make I would probably never go here again. The actual food is mediocre at best and blah at worst. You could really make a better sandwich at home. Like several of the other reviewers noted- the lack of customer service and unprofessional management is appalling.  It is hard to fault with the employees when it is clear the major issues are ineffective and unethical business practices and a lack of focus on the customer and quality control. It took three different people to handle my order because one person could not get my pastries from the case two feet away and ring me up- they had to wait to ask someone else to do it who was already busy in the back (?). I tried to give her my rewards number twice and she asked for my name to give to the other employee to get my pastries (?) and when I asked why and if she could just grab them for me she said \"you want me to do it\" and I said \"yes\". Then she grabbed them and rang up my order right when I was trying to give her my rewards number a third time. Then she said she already rang up the order and it was too late to put in my rewards number. I asked her to redo the transaction or do whatever she has to do to add my points and a manager came back who had no idea what happened, but basically tried to chastise me for her mistake. There was even another sweet female employee there who heard everything that happened and was nodding her head with everything I was saying while the manager bumbled around trying to justify her actions. He stated he didn't need to redo the order because he has a password and can add points on the card so he would take care of it, but (incredibly) said that she did what she was supposed to because they instruct their employees to LIE and say that they can't add reward points after an order is rung up because then \"thousands of people\" would ask them to do it. Really?!! Thousands- there are that many people you are trying to basically screw over with a Rewards program that you don't really want them to use!? And if she did what she was supposed to then she would've entered my rewards number during one of the first two times I tried to give it to her. Keep the 50 cents and don't have a program if you can't run it honorably."}
{"text":"Had to wait 30 mins in the drive thru with only one car in front of me. The hoes inside were yapping the whole time need new employees"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but they ran out of napkins!  Ok you can get low on napkins but how about running to Costco and getting some napkins??!!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! They have great sugar cookies and mint brownies! They are a little drier than I would like. The main reason why I am posting this is because I am hoping that a manager or someone who has some power will read it and feel the need to find a way to preserve freshness in baked goods. It's sad to me that bakeries always put all their baked goods on display. I'm sure this is to help them sell. Bakeries need to change this technique. They need to put one item on display and then keep everything either bagged or kept in a Tupperware container. Things will sell better if they are fresh, soft and preserved rather than dry and crusty. Please Kneaders, change the way you store your baked goods! They are too yummy to be left sitting out in a display case!"}
{"text":"I only had their frozen hot chocolate, but it was unforgettably delicious!  Comfy cozy environment that smells like heaven. Close to the beautiful Gilbert Mormon temple, which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Very quick service at the drive thru and nice pup friendly patio! Super fresh salad and the bread was served nice and warm."}
{"text":"They just opened, but everything is awesome! The food is super good, the owner is very friendly, and the atmosphere is very cozy and cute! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a good, hearty sandwich!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and I will definitely be back. The food is delicious and Tiffany is a walking advertisement for Kneaders with her great personality and her knowledge of all things Kneaders!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! The food is fresh and delicious. My go to is the chicken pesto panini. It's full of flavor and the perfect size to fill me up. I have tried multiple soups and breads as well. Desserts here are no joke! I recommend the turtle cheesecake. Service is also top notch. The only thing I would change is I wish they delivered. Until Then I'll make the drive"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great! The turkey and avocado sandwich was so yummy. My husband had the French Dip...but the homemade chicken noodle soup is amazing! So glad they're here!"}
{"text":"I decided to go inside for breakfast.  I had been through the drive thru for lunch once, but I have not been inside for breakfast.  I think I will just list the issues I experienced: 1. It is confusing on where to go when you first walk in.  No clear signage to direct you to \"order here\". 2.  There was no one at the register for a good five minutes while I stood there.  That may have also been why I was confused on where to go also.  3.  When the person did arrive to take my order, she did not give me any type of greeting.  She just looked at me, almost annoyed like.  I was clearly confused and trying to figure out the menu.  I found the menu to be confusing and not easy to figure out since it was my first time inside. 4.  I ordered the egg and cheese sandwich and a small coffee.  After paying, I was given a cup and no instructions on where the coffee is, how I will get my food, or even a \"thank you\". 5.  The coffee station was a mess, trash on the counter, the cream and milk strewn about, the coffee not clearly marked as to what it was. 6.  The coffee was not hot, just warm, and it lacked good flavor.  It tasted watered down to me. 7.  The sandwich arrived and it was a messy looking one.  The two eggs and cheese not evenly distributed, rather it seemed like it was slapped together in a hurry with little care.  The croissant it was on was huge compared to the filling also.  Not a good ratio.   8.  No one ever stopped by my table to see how my meal was, if i needed anything, or to take away the empty dish.  Although, one lady delivered someone else's food to me by mistake and I had to tell her that it was not mine.  I was hoping this place would be better.  I see it being compared to Panera on other posts.  Sorry, it is no Penera, not even close.  They need to improve in many areas.  Also, what is up with the wrapping paper and ribbon area?   That seemed odd to me.  Anyway, there are way too many other options for this place to get my business in the future.  Do yourself a favor and just go to Panera."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would. We have gone several times and the employees are dumb. No one knows anything at all. I bought my son a pb&j at first I looked and i thought they put the pb&j in little containers for him to spread on for himself. When we got home I noticed there was no pb&j, I opened the bread to put our own from home and saw the atrocity. It looks like they just dipped the knife and did a quick swipe.  There was literally nothing there. I spoke with Chris and he comped us a meal. Went again today to get my sons free meal and it took us 30 minutes for 1 pb & j sammie. Really. We will never set foot in this location again. When my husband asked why everyone else got their food before them the cashier sais she didn't know. This place ia ridiculous and will never get a good review from me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing food! Love the decor that is for sale, and the Turkey Bacon Avocado on sourdough bread!"}
{"text":"There was one little slice of meat on my pastrami sandwich. Chicken Noodle soup had hardly any chicken or noodles was basically broth. Prices were very high for what you get. Cafe Zupa is a much better value!"}
{"text":"I found mold on my ice. Showed the employee so they gave me new ice and new cup and when I got my soda it was flat. So I just ordered all this food, still waiting for it to come and by my experience so far, I'm more than worried about the quality of food."}
{"text":"I just barely went through the drive through and ordered a sandwich with no onions. They repeated back \"and you wanted no onions right?\" Right, I say. Then they repeat the whole order back to me and again acknowledge the no onions. I pull to the window, she hands me the food and reads the order again. Again stating \"no onions\" I get home and what do you know, onions are on my sandwich. I took them off and it is a delicious sandwich, but come on. What else could I have done other than being that annoying customer that holds up the line so she can make sure they got the order right? Super frustrated. And if onions go on a sandwich, even if you take them off there is still the smell and a lingering taste. Super frustrated."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The staff is wonderful and very well trained. The pastries, sandwiches, and soups are all amazing.  You can tell customer service is of the utmost importance, and you shouldn't be surprised if the team remembers your name, orders, and tid bits of conversations in passing.   I give praise very sparingly, but this place deserves it all.  Kudos to Ethan and the team, and I know will take great care of you when you decide to give this place try."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with cute gifts and some beautiful looking desserts. Our second time here yielded poor results once again. Long lines to order and even longer wait times for food- which was standard at best. I can't imagine how they are even able to run a drive thru. They have been open a month and we were here on opening day. By now the kinks should have been worked out. We waited 1/2 hour for food and had to check on it twice because sitting outside they would never find us. They don't give beepers or table numbers so you better keep an attentive ear or check frequently. My egg and cheese croissant was tasteless and even my iced coffee wasn't done correctly. Hubby had the omelet and commented that it wasn't bad but it also wasn't great. I think we are done here and going back to panera who seems to know how to get things right."}
{"text":"We want to love Kneaders but we had the worst experience the last 2 times we ate there...we even called the manager after the last time when I had 1 teeny slice of avocado on my \"turkey bacon avocado\" sandwich and one half of my sandwich had no turkey on it and got completely blown off....I wanna say we were laughed off. There is just a lack of quality control...so if you order take out make sure your double check all your items to ensure they are the way they should be!"}
{"text":"I love this place or chain. I don't have the complaints like the other yelpers because I just come for the good coffee and pastry. Occasionally I will get a bread loaf. Service is always warm and friendly along with the manager saying hello."}
{"text":"I ordered a birthday cake for my 2 yr old and it was delicious.  Everyone raved about it. I will definitely reorder for other occasions"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch after a friend raved about their breakfast. The food was good and the baked goods were also good. The faults I saw were that no one was cleaning the tables or floors and the trash was full. Also, the cashier was rude and ended up keeping my change. Might go back ...."}
{"text":"This place just opened a week or two ago and the start has been both smooth and rough. Here is our experience:  We read on Yelp that the drive thru took forever and always got food wrong. Due to having a large order, my wife went in. The line was to the door and moved at an okay pace. Considering that every seat was taken, the drive thru was in use, and the line was a good 10+ people it is not surprising that it took a while. She was slightly annoyed that it took nearly an hour from entering to exiting with food, but the food is supposed to be fabulous so it might be worth it! The food we received was definitely worth the wait!!!   HOWEVER...  We didn't receive several things we paid for and several of the things we did receive were incorrect (the wrong type of pastry, the wrong type of pie, etc).   Let's get back to the food. So delicious! The orange rolls are sweet and sticky and divine. The orange flavor permeates the entire thing. A+ The paninis seemed like they were lacking and a little thin. I feel like sandwiches should be a mouth full though. In the end my wife says that they tasted great and weren't like scary thin so over all I would give a B- for quantity of filling and an A+ for flavor and overall size (large side to side).  The salad was a surprisingly large size for one of these types of places. We got the sunflower turkey one and it was very good and very fresh tasting. A+ Pastries over all were a win! A+  So let us get to the big issue on the table, missing and incorrect product. My wife called immediately and a higher up guy from the franchise company answered. Apologized and was ridiculously friendly. FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Offered us a remake or a credit. We accepted the credit and my wife just went in. The manager on duty (she thinks) Chris took really great care of her. Made sure to talk with her, apologize profusely, went way above and beyond. Took off the large credit that Jody had written in for us. They had a specific employee working on packaging our order. He came out to go over the entire order with her. In going through it there were still a few mistakes. A couple were the fault of putting it in incorrectly and a few were the packager. My wife pointed out the packaging mistakes but felt bad and didn't want to make them remake the stuff from the cashier inputting it wrong so she didn't mention it. One of the fixes included giving her a higher priced item than she ordered. Very nice! Chris then offered to walk her to the car because the ordered was large. She accepted and he kindly helped her out.    I wish they had half stars because I would have gone up a half star. They have their service issues which we are attributing to being freshly open with a new computer system and being swamped non stop. Food quality and customer service are top notch! Just make sure to only go when you have a spare hour to pad your lunch time and you are okay with having to triple check your order."}
{"text":"I am glad that Kneaders is here. It sure is nice to have an alternative to greasy fast food in the area.  The menu is pretty large, with sandwich, salad, soup and sweets to choose from. The hot Turkey Artichoke focaccia is fantastic. The sandwich is huge, so a half really will do it. The parmesan kettle-style chips are a nice side. I love to try the different salads, and have found them all to be tasty and plentiful. The breads are fresh, and the sweets are to die for. Our recent addiction is the raspberry bread pudding. It is served with some kind of sweet cream. I bring it home, heat it up, and throw some ice cream on it for a decadent dessert.  The best part of it all, it that there is not only online ordering, but also a drive through! So those days I can only muster pajama pants, no one is the wiser! I do find that the drive through can take forever. But when you figure that they are making your food fresh, it's worth it."}
{"text":"First time trying Kneaders.  The store itself, I don't get the jewelry and lotion stuff...I'm not sure why don't put more of their bread on display or just open the place up a bit more and remove that stuff.  I ordered the chicken avocado and bacon on focaccia.  The focaccia was very good, unfortunately there was hardly any chicken, avocado and bacon on it.  It was way to much bread, though again...very good bread.  I thought the price included a drink and bag of chips but no, so it is a bit pricey.  The menu isn't to diverse either, wouldn't be first on my list grabbing a sandwich but I'd buy their bread there."}
{"text":"We have been to Kneaders before and this one fit the bill.  We had a Reuben sandwich and a smoothie.  Their smoothies are great and we love their sandwiches.  The people are really friendly and it has a little bit of a Cracker Barrel feel.  There is bread to buy to go."}
{"text":"Some people should not be in the service industry. Her name is Marlee (sp?).  She's abrupt when speaking to customers & never smiled (not pleasant) while addressing me. Customers should ALWAYS BE RIGHT! If she prepares my food, I will throw it away. I like my food made from a positive person. Speaking of which, Deana is fantastic. She understands the meaning of customer service."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I think I love this place. It kind of reminds me of a mash up between Panera and Cafe Zupas. I love the selection of sandwiches and soups they offer and will have to come again soon to experience other items on the menu. My last visit I had the Turkey, Bacon and Avocado sandwich along with the Chicken Enchilada Soup I think it was. Both were great!  If you want to check this place out a fair warning is that they're packed during normal lunch and dinner hours. Come at an off time if waiting is not your thing. I came with a friend and we made a point to get there a little before noon and it was still a little packed. But it was worth the wait. I'll be a frequent flyer for certain."}
{"text":"The food was good but the online ordering and service there after leaves much to be desired.  Our online order was supposed to be ready at noon. We had to wait for 20 minutes for the food to get prepared and then they shorted us on some items in the order.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"I love the kneaders in Avondale so I stopped in this one on my way to the airport. Grabbed 2 loafs of bread and literally stood in line for 10 minutes. The place was dead. The guy with the slick back black hair looked at me twice, 5 other employees passed right by the register and NO ONE offered to check me out."}
{"text":"I love Kneader's, to me it's a upscale Panera Bread but with better portions and salads. I like the baked goods and being able to have a gift basket made with your favorites for as a gift. I utilize the drive-thru from time-to-time as easy access but I like going in as well, great environment."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst Kneaders experience I've had in weeks upon weeks. I was in the kneaders drive-through at 8:10 PM Wednesday night November 8, 2017 upon ordering I experience that they were out of almost everything coffees, soup, iced teas and cheesecake. All that I ordered the response I got was we're getting ready to close. The response I got that they don't have any of the items were getting ready to close because we are short on employees. Why should I have to suffer for Kneaders closing early at 8:15 when the sign on the window says 10 o'clock. The night asst. manager is never insight to help when there is always a line. When I received my order my coffee was cold. The manager was aware of the issue and took my coffee to the back to warm it up in the microwave. The weather has changed and therefore they should have hot beverages available to have with desserts."}
{"text":"I've been her a couple times and it is pretty tasty food. Definitely not fast food though. Even a short line is a long wait. Usually there is only one cashier taking orders--even with the line out the door. They have two cash registers but from my experience they typically only use one. Also they are always out of menu items. Tonight very few soups left at dinner time once again. And no bread either, that's kind of a bummer for a self-proclaimed bakery this is disappointing to be out of bread. Sad really. The service is very nice but management has to get a handle on the flow of people and the inventory. I have been here for close to 45 minutes for a soup and sandwich. They have only been open a couple months so I hope they can get things under control soon. Pretty unhappy with my experiences here; every visit I find myself getting really upset with how they run things. I write this as I wait...and wait...and wait. Closing in on a full hour now waiting for a consolation soup and sandwich... Just arrived home and the French Onion soup doesn't have the bread or the cheese in it. So basically it's missing half the ingredients. More like a cup of onions than French Onion Soup."}
{"text":"You know I love this place but can't take their ineptitude any longer.... Went through the drive thru tonight and almost every order was wrong... From being served soda water for diet soda, sandwiches missing veggies or being served the end cut of the vegetables, to being laughed at in the drive thru for correcting the workers that our order was still missing items... Good luck kneaders, with service like that your gonna need it!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed, good service, the expensive sandwich I had didn't t have much meat, subway puts more meat on there sandwiches & that's not good, chips are extra, drinks are extra, we saw it, tried it, won't go back, I'll stick to the piled high sandwiches at Jason's Deli or Panera, to each is own, looks like a busy place, just not good value for the money, nice atmosphere, maybe that's what your paying for."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our breakfast there.  Also, we had a get together of 6 of us at my sisters condo and I volunteered to bring dessert.  I stopped at Kneaders and bought a Apple Cobbler Pie and it was a hit at dinner. Good Coffee there and great breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"I'm always disappointed when I go there.  Every single time , they are out of what I want.  When I request a different one, that's also out.  I don't eat the sandwiches, because half the meat is missing snd the sandwich is dry.  They are always out of the two soups I like and three different desserts.  Very disappointing.  Yesterday, my husband came out with his meal, but I got nothing.  I'm disabled, and we are always trying to figure out what I can eat.  I think your foods are a bit pricey, but if I can get something I like, it's worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to this Kneaders location about 6 times now, and I believe I have a firm grasp of what service you receive on a given day. I will break this down on a couple different topics.  Décor: This is one of their best attributes by far. If you've never been to one, you'll be greeted with amazing holiday décor or seasonal trinkets. They have tons of seating, and gift wrapping for any gifts you may want. Most locations also have a drive thru, which is helpful, but can also take quite a long time.   Food: OMG!!! If you love baked goods, look no further. I love the brownies, cakes, I could go on and on. The baked goods are always on point, so don't be afraid to try them all!!! They bake bread daily, and have a take home section for all their baked goods. They serve normal fare for a bakery/café. I usually get the French dip, and the Aus Jus is amazing! One of the reasons I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the bread to protein ratio. You get a huge amount of bread, with little protein in comparison to the bread. I recently put in an order for Thanksgiving. I was able to reserve 1 dozen rolls, 1 pie, and a pumpkin bread. I love this idea, and this should really be looked into for those who may need help. Customer Service: I have never had a problem with this. The service, for me, has always been spot on. The manager said hi to us while dining in, and the servers/workers are always moving.   Overall: I truly do love this place, and I would've loved to give 5 stars. Unfortunately, I believe the combo prices should be lowered slightly, and maybe adjust the ratio for some of their food and I will raise this review. Of course, I will return, I will continue to support a business that is closed on Sundays, and on holidays for the staff to enjoy family time."}
{"text":"Great place! Great food! Great employees! I must commend the management....a family of DB's came in with their little dogs....manager \"hey folks we can't have the dogs in here it's a restaurant\"  I imagine there are health codes ect....DB's \" yeah we know, we are eating outside\"???? And just continued to just stand there I guess they thought they could just wait to order then go outside,,,,instead of one DB goes outside with the dogs and the 3 other DB'S order....poor manager had to go up to them again and inform them that this is a restaurant and dogs are not allowed. The next thing you hear is FU A**hole, and all four DB's run out....I sure taking the filthy mutts to another restaurant. Haha. I know! I have dogs and it's everyone else's problem. Ridiculous!  Do the world a favor and don't be DB's, even more importantly don't teach your kids to be DB's showing them that this BS is the correct way to act in public when things don't go your way.  Let's take the world back from all the DB's!!"}
{"text":"Best smoothies I have ever had!  Such nice people working the til.   10/10 will be back. Strawberry Tsunami is worth a try! Very light & refreshing.   So close to my house, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice....just what I need not too far away from my house....fresh baked CARBS!  Kneaders is very much like those other chain companies that advertise lots & lots of fresh baked in-house breads and baked treats.  Kneaders has it in spades!  I assume it's busy because it is basically one of the only bakery/restaurant types in that area of town.  But actually it's not a bad place to visit!  Upon stepping in you get hit with that scent of fresh baked goods and boy can it be totally inviting.  Step right in...get your daily dose of gluten!  Before this review, I'd say we have gone to Kneaders at least 3 times.  A couple times at night and once in the wee of the morning.  I gotta say I don't mind the food at all.  Very rustic charm, very old-timey country American.  Kneaders is known for their sandwiches, breads, and pastries.  They also do soups and salads and even pies too.  On our first visit there we had:  -Club Sandwich ($8.39) - turkey, roast beef, ham, Kneaders sauce (similar to 1000 island), provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, salt & pepper, all on French Country Sourdough  -French Dip ($6.99) - roast beef, Swiss cheese, salt & pepper, au jus on the side, served on a baguette  Damn, they make some mighty fine sandwiches!  Wifey's club was a good side and loaded with meat.  Bread was baked relatively fresh, good crust on the outside with a nice tangy taste from the sourdough.  French Dip for me was great!  I love me a French Dip!  This one sure didn't disappoint!  Au jus wasn't too salty, baguette was crunchy and hearty but not stale.  Quite surprised, a decent sandwich from a chain!  With the sandwiches you can also combo up and add a small dessert/pastry, chips and a drink for an extra $4 or so.    Don't forget the breakfast!  Upon a return visit the little one got the all-you-can-eat French Toast or Sourdough Pancakes for just $6 and change.  She liked their thick slices of French Toast!  Comes with a side of strawberries, whipped cream & caramel syrup.  Beware though, you can only choose French Toast OR Sourdough Pancakes.  When you refill, you can only get the same item you first ordered.  Which seems kinda silly to me but I guess that's just how they do it at Kneaders.  Same set price...why not let us try BOTH?  They also do something I've never seen in a restaurant before, build a basket?  Yep!  Have one of the staff create you a gift basket to take home while you wait or while you eat!  Full of fresh baked breads and pastries!  They really have all the boxes/ribbon/wrap all right there in store.  Strange, but I guess it works!  Only downgrade I have is that it can get a bit pricey dining at Kneaders.  I guess it would be on par with that of a deli joint.  No value meals here, but I suppose you do get value for your money regardless.  Just be careful, wifey's sandwich combo alone set us back more than $12!  To make up for it, grab an extra helping of some of Kneader's samples up at the checkout counter!  #carbfriendly"}
{"text":"I ordered food from the drive thru. Food was piping hot and fresh. Pretty quick drive thru too. The canoli was on point! A little hint of orange. Soups and sandwhices tasted fresh and homemade. This place def has a leg up on Panera because of the drive thru. To be able to get good quality food fast is awesome!"}
{"text":"A small and quiet cafe that's a really good place to get work done, like a Starbucks. The food is decent but I think the prices should be lowered. The baked goods are what draws me in. The cinnamon rolls are to die for and the cheese danish is amazing. The drink selection also lacks creativity and customization. I recommend picking up Starbucks and getting a sweet treat from kneaders to start your morning."}
{"text":"Oh my my my! This place is phenomenal! I've been going to kneaders for a couple years now!  Homemade breads made into sandwiches and even croutons. The Turkey Bacon avocado sandwich/salad are loaded we with goodies.  They don't scrimp or hold back, they pile it on. And the coolest thing about this place is they have a drive thru at all the locations.  My favorite thing to do is pick up their famous french toast in the morning while still in my PJs! They went over the top when making this sinfully delicious syrup! Try it! And don't forget to try the smoothies....they are like icing on the cake! ."}
{"text":"I loved Kneaders at first, but now it's just okay. The omelets are looking more like crepes instead of an omelet. My 8 yr old looked at it & said 'that looks awful.' It's very brown and cut into strips. They also cut the toast back from 2 pieces to 1. Lastly, the coffee (decaf & regular) used to be really really good! But now...it seems as if they made it weaker or they changed it altogether.   The desserts are still good. That would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"I want so badly to love this place but their meat to bread ratio is rediculous!!  Don't get me wrong, they do have some good stuff, but come on.  When spending that much on a sandwich, in this case a bacon, lettuce, avocado, I expect there to be SOME meat and avocado on it."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch today and the food was great! I had a BLT that was the best I ever had. We also ordered the RUEBEN and it was delicious. There is a full selection on the menu and there is something for everyone. I will stop in again when in the neighborhood for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The salads are always incredible - Chicken A La Mondo is the best but they're all good. (Unlike what another reviewer said, they are always made fresh...dunno where he got that.) The bread, no matter what kind you get, is phenomenal. The salted caramel cheesecake was to die for.   The coffee is kinda pricey, but it's worth it for the rest of the food. And I personally love the little stuff they sell. It's like a more stylish version of going to Cracker Barrel. One of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at 1130 today and the line as out the door. They had samples while you're waiting in line which was nice. The soups don't have a description of what they are so I asked the cashier what the \"Irish stew\" was. She said she didn't know. So obviously I didn't get it but that's sort of weird she didn't know what it was like. I got a 1/2 soup and 1/2 salad. The soup (chicken noodle) was good, salad (chicken chop subbed a vinaigrette for the blue cheese that came with it) it was okay, very basic.. nothing special. Although the bread & croutons that come with it were great, so fresh & delicious! They have some bread on sample too. Also, the selection of pastries, breads and desserts (cakes, pies, cupcakes, everything) is pretty impressive. I would definitely come back, just hoping the crowds die down a little :)"}
{"text":"Always run out of popular soups and carrot cake. Now they cut corners and don't sell the cake in loaf slices..WOW. Talk about cheap. They offer cake parfaits! 1/2 the size of their regular size and doesn't taste the same. Too bad as we always brought groups of friends here and out of state family who all LOVED the sliced cake. Where's the pumpkin choc chip cake? Bring back cake loafs!!"}
{"text":"I had never been to kneaders so when they opened up down the street I decided to give it a try. Not knowing what to expect it was not what I expected. Turned out to be an overpriced Corner Bakery. The cashier had an annoying valley girl voice and had to repeat our order 3 times until she repeated it back to us properly. The food was average (pancakes, French toast, omelette) and the French toast was not warm at all. The desserts in the case looked delicious but I did not try them. Probably will not go back unless I'm in the mood for high priced Denny's food"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Kneaders and I ordered the Chicken Pesto Panini. The drive-thru service was pretty fast which was nice. The sandwich was better than average, but not as good as some other chains (Panera paninis are better, in my opinion). The bread was great but the sandwich seemed to be lacking something. More herbs? A distinctive taste? I give them a thumbs up for using fresh natural ingredients and not adding loads of salt or other additives. The reason I gave it three stars and not four is the chips seemed a little stale. While I loved the Parmesan topping, they were more on the chewy side while I prefer crunchy. I would go back here and maybe try a salad or smoothie."}
{"text":"Really cute place! Service was extremely friendly. Food was very good. The turkey artichoke panini took a little long, which they apologized for and then they brought out a second one because they said they delivered one that was missing some of the ingredients (someone else ordered the exact same thing but modified). They boxed up the new one for me to take home. Awesome resolution!! The chicken ala mondo was delicious!! Especially the dressing! I will return -- just wish they were open after church :)"}
{"text":"Came here for dessert around 1:30pm and the place was empty. I wonder what it's like during the breakfast/ brunch.  The pastry were average for my taste and the service is more like help yourself.  Although the decor was cute."}
{"text":"We got a large carry-out order for a work function and the food was amazing. The bread is made fresh at the restaurant and you can taste the difference. Everything was amazing. Prices are reasonable too. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Consistently really good and extremely fresh. Love their bread and meats veggies. Just got their club sandwich and it's probably the best club I've ever had. A little on the spendier side but as they, you get what you pay for. This ain't no Subway. Friendly service, clean place. Full on 1/2 a sanwhich, meal for later."}
{"text":"What a pleasant place to walk in to. Interesting and fun knickknacks and jewelry to look at, which is fun but WAIT... it smells SO GOOD. My mouth started watering just at the thought of freshly baked goods. I got a breakfast sandwich on croissant. DELISH. The croissant was buttery and flaky just Luke's it's supposed to be. I had no idea that they served breakfast and lunch, plus the display of baked treats looks amazing! Can't wait to come back for dessert next time. They also have this really cute wrapping station where you can have delicious treat wrapped up for gifting. (Super helpful for people like me?). Really the only \"grow\" I could give would be to be acknowledged sooner. It did take several minutes for someone to even say hi. Overall very pleased with my experience, thank you!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant.  Had lunch there.  Food was outstanding.  What I love most is all the bakery goods. They have a huge variety and looks delicious.  So impressed that I signed up for their rewards card.  Can't wait to try breakfast.  Parking lot is full all the time.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch between errands and decided these salads are far superior to Panera or any other local salad place. Plus, their to-go containers are amazing for reuse! A+ customer service!"}
{"text":"I don't really know what the hype is.  This place just opened, so we tried it.  Had a turkey avocado sandwich... Bread was NOT spectacular and whatever mayo mixture on the bread was just gross (and I typically like mayo).  It seemed just like any other bread.  The turkey was essentially tasteless and dry.  We also ordered a southwest salad.  Seriously very plain and the dressing was again tasteless.  The inside atmosphere is VERY loud.  People barking order names out (in lieu of a table number system for food distribution)...   Also it may seem odd, but they simply bring the food to your table.  No utensils or napkins.  The person delivering the food to the tables was outright rude about the arrangement.  At lunch, the parking lot is crazy full with tight spaces (Mostly old people with large cars, who can't seem to fit in the marked spaces).  For the food and prices, Zupa, Panera or Grand Lux Cafe seems to be a better choice."}
{"text":"Great place! Food and service were prompt. Ordered the Southwest BBQ Chicken salad and it was one of the BEST I have ever had. The full size salad was plentiful with lots of great ingredients; even had enough chicken for the entire salad. The only bummer about the salad is that bread doesn't come with it.  The only reason this wasn't five stars is that the booths had not been bussed at this restaurant and the drink station was unkempt (ice tea was HOT and immediately melted any ice making it watery and undrinkable). Also, we originally were told that salads come with bread - although the one we ordered did not apparently because of the tortilla strips (we had to go back to order bread separately because we were told incorrectly)."}
{"text":"Have been to this location twice. Both times most tables are filthy. Never once have I seen anyone wiping off tables. We have to clean our own table in order to sit down. Today was my second visit. Order potato soup to go for my sick daughter. That's all she wanted. Waited 30 minutes - still no soup. Inquired at counter - seems they lost my order. Then they said they are out of potato soup! Got a refund and will never return. This place has serious management problems."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this location opened and we usually come here for breakfast and it's always great - no complaints there.    However, I've been twice now for dinner and both experiences were lack luster to say the least.  The first time, my panini wasn't super warm, like it hadn't been in the press long enough, so it was just okay.  My daughters sandwich was really greasy though, so that was kind of gross.  On our most recent visit I was thoroughly disappointed.  My panini was cold. Not cool, ice cold.  The cheese wasn't melted at all. As good as the breakfast is I wish the effort was consistent throughout the day.  Everyone is so friendly in the morning and in the evenings, even when it's not close to closing time, I feel like they are getting ready to leave and I am slowing them down.  It's a little out of the way for us to keep coming back just to be disappointed, especially when Corner Bakery Cafe just opened and they are more consistent."}
{"text":"MAYO ON EVERYTHING. Literally mayonnaise on every single ingredient of my vegetable sandwich. Barely edible. Not healthy."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. I love it. The food selection is good and everything I have tried has tasted great. Although they are still working out some kinks since they just opened, the manager is doing an amazing job providing top notch customer service despite the learning curve for some of the employees. I really enjoyed the Irish stew and Reuben sandwich. All the desserts are amazing."}
{"text":"This is a good breakfast place as an alternative to Panera. The breakfast selection was more vast and comparable/ slightly better pricing. The service was pleasant and the food tasted great :)"}
{"text":"They never have soup ready or they throw it away too early way before closing time!!! And don't ever try drive thru you'll sit there forever!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous.  Fresh.  Great assortment and the pastries excellent.  Service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing hot sandwich I've ever purchased!  Went through the drive through window so I didn't know what I had purchased for $9 until I got home!  Skimpy piece of meat, one leaf of basil and the worst pesto I've ever tasted.  Do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best desserts ever! Great place to pick up bread bowls for homemade soup too! Been there for breakfast and lunch and both are good!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for coffee on a chill Tuesday morning. Just a medium coffee to warm up. Cashier offered free samples so that's a good thing. Coffee was good and the shop was really quiet except for the four elderly gentlemen behind me planning an event and discussing the size of appropriate name tags. Kneader's is close to Panera which is always busy. I'd comeback to avoid the crowds up the street."}
{"text":"Their bread is delicious love the breakfast and all the cute stuff inside the shop is so fun!!"}
{"text":"Service in drive thru was quick and friendly cause place was empty for lunch...granted new and not on corner.  However salad was mostly spinach and nothing very good. I could have made that ay home and for 9 bucks i can go to many other places and get better. Dissapointing...was so hopeful for a better option."}
{"text":"I'm so glad a decent cafe opened in Vegas that isn't Panera. Fresh-baked breads and pastries aside, the sandwiches are delicious -- I had a great chicken pesto panini combo with homemade(?) thick-cut parmesan chips and tomato basil soup. I also ordered 3 cinnamon rolls to take home for my family because they looked irresistible. It's nice to find a good bun in Vegas (hear that, Grindr?!).   The parking lot was busy as well as the drive-thru window. The line inside was a few people deep, but it moved quickly. There's a separate counter to order breads and pastries only. Drinks are self-serve (3 kinds of unsweetened fresh-brewed iced teas? Yes!) unless you get one of their smoothies.   They also offer breakfast and salads, which I will definitely come back to try. I was very impressed with the service from the order-takers to the food runners, everyone was very friendly and had smiles on their faces even though they were super busy.   As I'm writing this, I witnessed a lady who complained to management that her french dip to-go order has cheese on it (which I'm sure she never bothered to say she didn't want so now it becomes the restaurant's problem -- such is the false mentality of \"customer is always right\"). The manager quickly and politely offered her to keep the sandwich, and he'll have another one made without cheese for her right away. Now that's service!  Definitely a great alternative to grabbing fastfood."}
{"text":"Their chunky French toast is wonderful; their decaf coffee was great too.  Have made numerous visits and good each time"}
{"text":"The staff at this store is completely incompetent. We had ordered online and prepaid, only to arrive at the store and find out that they were out of two of the three items that my wife had ordered. When I asked for a refund, they were unable to, saying that it had to go thru their corporate office.  What was most disturbing though, was that they were completely unapologetic and lacked any discernible customer service skills. Needless to say, we wont be back."}
{"text":"Usually great quality but food is slipping. Recently had problems with stale chips, Poor cuts of meat, sloppy preparation in kitchen."}
{"text":"So disappointing! We ordered a few sandwiches- one of them being a French dip sandwich. We got the order to go and when we got home- the French dip literally had 1 very thin slice of meat on it, with the baguette being rock hard, even after being dipped in sauce. So don't order this sandwich unless you want to have bread dipped in sauce- seriously- which I would have taken a picture. We had to add our own leftover meat from Christmas for it to even be edible. What a waste of money and time even picking it up. This place use to be good, but something has changed and it is utterly disappointing and I will not ever go back!"}
{"text":"Out of rolls the day before Easter. Very disappointing. Watched someone walk in and then out right before me, obviously looking for the same product. It's a shame that such a good bakery comes to our area and can not fully service our community."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and the staff is always very welcoming and pleasant. Please note, I have only utilized the drive thru. I ordered a ham, egg, and cheese, on ciabatta bread. The awesome thing is, you can substitute egg whites in all orders! My two complaints are it seems to be a very heavy sandwich, lots of butter or oil on both the eggs and the bread. Secondly, there is no consistency with the sizing on the sandwiches. I order the exact same thing and sometimes I would receive a triangle shaped sandwich, a rectangle, a square. All different sizes with no real consistency on what I should be expecting."}
{"text":"I was a little worried about this place as I typically don't like salad and sandwhich places but not only do I love my chicken tortilla soup and my turkey sandwhich, the service was amazing. A manager went out of his way to help me with my order then I saw he was willing to help in the kitchen when things got backed up. Somehow there was a mistake on my order so he gave me both and I really wasn't waiting that long for it. They were so great!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Kneaders, they have great food and amazing customer service. I wanted to try a smoothie since everything else is great, but they were out of one of the ingredients. Daniel, the employee working the drive-thru, was very polite and apologetic. I will never understand how some people can get so angry over simple mistakes, especially when employees handle it with professionalism and kindness. I can, however, tell you this is the greatest Kneaders I've been to and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This location is right down the street from me so it is very convenient.   They have breakfast items, salads, soups, sandwiches, specialty coffees, smoothies, fresh baked breads & rolls, pastries, cakes and pies. You can also make your own gift baskets. They also have misc. items to purchase such as aprons, mugs, ceramics, etc...   There are two separate lines; one for the bakery and the other for food. Lines can get long depending on what time of the day you go. They also have a drive thru. I personally have never used it.   Items tried and liked (so far): Turkey Cranberry Salad Southwest BBQ Chicken Salad Thai Chicken Salad Turkey Cranberry Croissant Sugar Cookies  Chunky Cinnamon Bread Aloha Coconut Sweet Bread Asiago Cheese Bread  Their salads are pretty filling so a half order is perfect for my daughter & I.  *Note- we usually order the full size salad at Panera & Cafe Zupas. They also have free samples of breads (2 or 3 different varieties) at the order/register area so don't forget to grab a slice or two :) Also please use the provided tissue to take your bread and not your bare hands! :0  I swear some people have no common sense!   They have a Frequent Diner card.  Ask for it at the register.  The more you eat, the more points you get. You earn 1 point for every dollar spent. For every 100 points, you will earn a $5 reward that will automatically be loaded to your card.   They have an ongoing fundraiser called \"Hope Fights Childhood Cancer\" on their website and sometimes items are available at the restaurant. All proceeds go to childhood cancer research. Everything is elephant themed; cookies, t-shirts, stuffed animals, etc... If you are able, please help by purchasing any of these awesome items!   Place is clean & organized. The decor Farmhouse.  It's quite roomy and perfect for big groups. There are also tables outside.  So far the staff that I have encountered have all been helpful & friendly.  This franchise is Mormon owned which means they are closed on Sunday's.   Overall Kneaders is a nice & relaxing place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place ZERO STARS. alright well first off, I went here with a friend on a Saturday morning and ordered very non complicated breakfast items. our order came very late while other people who came in 20 minutes after us were getting their food first. our coffee was done very poorly and had to be sent back twice and my caramel macchiato was still basically a cup of ice and milk and my friends was nothing but black coffee after she had ordered cream and caramel in it. next, we both ordered fruit with our breakfast and my friend found an EYELASH in her fruit. next, I ordered the egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and it came with just egg?? I had to send it back and the server was very rude, looking very annoyed that I was asking to had my order done right. overall this entire experience was frustrating and I will definitely NOT BE COMING BACK. this was absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place does have amazing desserts but don't bother to order the chicken noodle soup.  The noodles are so swollen they are like mush and look like they are about to disintegrate.  My guess, it's been out all day  or made way too many days ago.  Additionally, I may as well of gotten chicken noodle soup in a can when it comes to chicken quality. I hade to pick out the prices that looked foreign.  Also I ordered their grilled cheese sandwich and it tasted like something I can't say on here. I've had their French dip and is pretty good but the soup and grilled cheese sandwich was so disappointing that I felt the need to leave this review. Also my husband got the club sandwich and he said we will not be going back there but for anything besides deserts."}
{"text":"The food is excellent but not enough to make up for the super unfriendly and unhelpful staff and manager.  The cashier could've cared less if we were there or not and clearly wasn't paying attention to our ordering based on the follow up questions she had to ask. The servers were unhelpful and dissappered when asked a question or for help. The manager finally came out to our table and his only response was I'm sorry you had an awful unpleasant horrible experience and didn't get what you asked or paid for!!!!! Won't be back to this location maybe ever or any Kneaders for awhile"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with Kneaders. Sandwiches, soup, cinnamon rolls are all amazing!"}
{"text":"First time checking this place out.  When you walk in it feels like fall.  The smell of the pastries and breads are to day for. I tried a turkey feta salad and it was so fresh and good.  I had a full portion for $8.99 and they also offer a half for $5.99. They also have sandwiches and soups. I will be going back. Very nice and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just waited over 25 min for 4 already made desserts and a simple cold coffee drink...   Was very unwelcoming and everyone was beyond rude.   This is a Utah owned establishment so you are being warned now the vibes are very country and republican...       Again this place is very horrible and bad bad bad customer service!"}
{"text":"Heard rave reviews about this place, so stopped in to grab a quick breakfast. Got a ham, egg and cheese croissant sandwich, side of fruit, orange juice combo and a chai tea latte. The sandwich was ok, nothing special, the fruit iMessage in ripe and crunchy, juice was good and the latte lacked flavor.. Had had much better at Dunkin Donuts surprisingly. For $12, I'm unsure if I'll return."}
{"text":"I'd been here once before, recently, but I'd only gone through the drive-thru so my visit  this past Friday was my first time dining inside. This place is so cute!! There's a pop-up boutique inside on your way to the order counter, and right now it's decked out with Halloween decor and goodies and I want it ALL. Their fresh bread display had me drooling, too! Great pricing. Why buy stale bread at the store when I can pay the same here for fresh artisan bread?! Clearly not a whole lot of people know about this place yet. Oh, best part: BOTTOMLESS FRENCH TOAST. YUH HUH HUM."}
{"text":"I LOVE that there's a drive-thru option. Convenience AND tasty food that's way healthier compared to any other drive-thru in town."}
{"text":"It blows my mind that this place even has three stars considering this was one of the worst meals I've had in my life. I ordered the chicken caprese panini with a strawberry smoothie. It took a while to get my food- strike one.  When I got the food (I got take out), it was just awful. They should have put deli paper on the bottom of the takeout container. I only ate it ten minutes after getting it, but the bread was super soggy. Also, the bread (Which you'd think would be good), tasted like day (Maybe week) old bread that they had microwaved. It was so chewy it was inedible. The chicken was also horrendous. It was flavorless, rubbery, and had a funky taste. I took all the chicken out and gave it to my dog. \"Marinated in pesto\" -- such bull. The only redeeming part of the sandwich was that the tomato and cheese were edible.   The smoothie was also garbage. It was sweeter than a capri sun with melted jolly ranchers. I only say that because that is how artificial it tasted. I tasted it and immediately thought I was eating some form of liquid jolly ranchers. The chips that came were also stale and over cooked. It is not that difficult to make chips and yet, Kneaders successfully messed that up. For over $10, I was horrified at the quality of this meal. You could not pay me to come back. Only in Mesa could a place like this be moderately successful. Do yourself a favor and avoid eating here like the plage-- heck, even go to Subway across the street. Subway is also trash but it is worlds better than this place."}
{"text":"Cultural wasteland of an eatery diluting the quality of Arcadia. Easily the worst Reuben I have ever had and quite possibly the worst sandwich - I look back more fondly on 99 cent Carl Budding meat sandwiches as a kid than what I had. The misses barely ate any of her turkey sandwich. The meat was weird and it was mostly just bread. On the bright side, she said the soup was okay. 20 minute wait in the drive thru. Kind of expensive for the Panera-esque food. The staff at this location was friendly so kudos to them."}
{"text":"I had been waiting to try this place for a while and I can at least say that the cookies are good. So why the one star? Well that would be the service, while most places with this type of setup will take your cookie order and then ring you up our person made us tell her our order from the register. This really wouldn't be a problem if the register was right next to the cookies but it was over 6 feet away. I don't really understand what her issue was just grabbing cookies.   Still not really worth a one star, that being said it was the next action that hurt. She had started to grab other orders which I understand but then a costumer came up to the register and she proceeded to take the ladies order with her gloves on and then proceeded to grab other hot food orders without changing her gloves.  Think about someone taking cash with the same gloves without changing them or washing their hands."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. But awful service. I placed online and phone orders multiple times and each time my order is never ready on time. It's atleast 10 minutes late. And I can see the food ready no one takes the time to put it in the bag. Today I went in and there was only a few people in the whole place and I was waiting 15 past the time my order was to be ready. They need to hire more people who give customer service with a sense of urgency. It is ridiculous"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a delicious breakfast today at Kneaders. We ordered the cinnamon French toast. The toast was thick and sweet and I loved the addition of cream, strawberries and amazing caramel sauce. The whole visit was a treat! Thank you Kneaders, for offering breakfast."}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL!! The food is pretty good but if you have nut allergies, BE CAREFUL! My youngest son is VERY allergic to nuts. He had an allergic reaction to a (nut free)mint brownie. There needs to be signs saying all of the food is prepared where nuts may have been present."}
{"text":"Always very good. The service has always been friendly and prompt...exceptional!! Love the turkey, cranberry, sunflower salad..,.and all of their breads!!"}
{"text":"Order their chicken raspberry salad Chicken was way dry like it was sitting uncoverd and had dried out due to lack of moisture. Dressing was good cannot mess up spinach, but the candied nuts really lacked flavor. Pricey place and really need to step up their product quality. Only to revisit if I'm with someone who wants to go there."}
{"text":"We recently stopped by and tried the french toast and it was delish.  The whipped cream and homemade caramel sauce was super decadent and the perfect sweet start to our morning.  This place is super kid friendly."}
{"text":"amazing fresh food great people great service bakery is incredible"}
{"text":"I like Kneaders, but this location is the worst! Been a few times. My order is always wrong and the food tastes aweful!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you need fresh orange juice Sometimes you need an almond croissant Sometimes you need bacon, eggs, cheese on a croissant Always you need pie All of the above was to go, but it was so good I had to finish it immediately.  First time here and it won't be my last. Friendly staff that do an above average job! Comfortable seating! Holla atcha boy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Kneaders and now prefer it to Paradise/Panera. The people are always friendly and the food is high quality. The meat is fresher than comparable places too. Love Kneaders!"}
{"text":"Kneaders can make really good bread and deserts but the soups but sandwiches and soups are not that great. I had a chicken salad sandwich and it was so boring. It was served on a croissant and it had tiny pieces of chicken and celery mayo too. I had the wedding soup and it was just blah. I could tell it was a serious pre-mix. My two kids had the chicken noodle soup and the noodles are bigger than Paradise Bakery but it has little flavor. Its just boring and it sucks that its boring."}
{"text":"I have been to kneaders dozens of times because the girls from work like to go. I have yet to have one order fulfilled properly. They can never get a simple order correct. They will however correct it for you but this last time I went I went through the drive thru I got extra turkey on my salad and when I got home I seemed to get less turkey then a normal amount and I took a bite and it was like I was eating sand. You could literally see dirt all over the lettuce. I have literally never had my order correct and it's a simple order-salad with turkey and ranch. One time they actually had to remake my salad 3 times and I'm not the type of person to send food back. I am officially done with this place!"}
{"text":"While eating here on a Friday night, sampling the food, and studying the décor, I said to my girlfriend:  \"This place is the textbook definition of a generic corporate bakery buried in the suburbs.\"  There's your soups, salads, coffees, and pastries - all of which are subpar in quality to what you can find at any reputable, locally owned sandwich shop.  I ordered a half classic café sandwich, which consisted of dry turkey, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions. My girlfriend ordered the ham and cheese. We both chose the focaccia bread. We've had some incredible focaccia bread in the past, but I guess I was simply asking too much from this place. Both choices were as painfully dull as those horrendous airline sandwiches they'd provide flyers back when they still served food.  They were stocked with packets of Tapatio, so I could at least attempt to breath some life into mine. Unfortunately, no amount of hot sauce could save these things. It was honestly no better than something I could have made at home using ingredients from the Wal-Mart deli section. In the end, eating it was the equivalent of a pill junkie trying to obtain an intense high from Ibuprofen. It just ain't gonna work!  I ordered a cream of broccoli soup, which was pretty consistent with the broccoli soup I used to serve while working at McDonalds in the late 90s. My girlfriend ordered a chicken noodle, but requested to swap it out after it wasn't hot enough for her taste.  Even my sugar cookie, which was soft, dry, and probably several days old couldn't boost my spirits by the end of our meal. Since it my was my choice to try this place, I had to take the blame for our Friday night failure.  Honestly, I've never really been too keen on these chain bakeries that so many people frequent, while pretending to eat healthy. While I'm sure there are some that are better than others, I don't really feel that Kneaders does anything different than what you can find at any other bakery chain in Phoenix.   In the end, Kneaders does everything they're supposed to do - it's just that I've seen it done better. So much better.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Kneaders Bakery Cafe I wanted to try it out my Experience was Great I ordered a Chicken Caesar salad and added avocado the portion was big and they were very generous on the avocado  It was very fast and extremely friendly service the young lady also brought out my food to me as I placed it to go  She was super friendly and nice , also chose the key lime mini tart and it was also very good . I highly recommend this Restaurant  Bakery I will definitely be back to try the French Toast :-)"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. I came in at 5:30pm and ordered. It is now 6 and haven't got my food. Poorly managed"}
{"text":"We will definitely be back, especially since there is a drive through! It's like Panera Bread and Cracker Barrel had a baby! Such good food and at an amazing price!  Not to mention the staff is so nice and tbe manager seems like a pretty great leader! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Love the breakfast here! Cheap and delicious! Also, the bakery is amazing! The orange rolls are to die for!!!! The lunch here isn't the best in my opinion but my family does enjoy that too!"}
{"text":"Just ok.  Nice service, military get free fountain soda, no wifi.  Had the $7 pastrami on rye, no rolls available.    Sandwich was served quickly, cold.    May be back if group attends, but not going to be a regular."}
{"text":"As someone who recently moved here, I was very impressed with the place. I went around 1:30pm, and it wasn't very busy. I got a panini from them which tasted fine, but it was really their cauliflower soup and my moms croissant sandwich that won me over. And their Napoleon tasted great too.  Nice staff, pretty good food, super fast."}
{"text":"Meh.   Tried multiple sandwiches, not impressed. Front counter seems extremely disorganized as well. Myself as well as another customer waiting for pastries which could easily be grabbed and bagged in 2 seconds. Literally had to ask someone to just take care of it after watching people stand around. Why are you processing ALL orders in the order they were requested? I shouldn't have to wait 5 minutes for someone elses sandwich in front of my single grab and go cookie."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is so cute inside, the food is just delicious.  The staff is very friendly and helpful!  I really enjoy the turkey cranberry croissant!  A must try!  If I could I'd give it a 10! this place!  Best chocolate eclairs ever!"}
{"text":"The Mango Tango Smoothie with spinach was recommended and it's my new favorite! I went there for breakfast this morning and tried the Chunky French Toast which was yummy and filling. My husband tried the Croissant Sandwich with eggs and shredded turkey, and he said it melted in his mouth! I was impressed by the atmosphere and the food! Kneaders Bakery has the cutest gift shop, a fireplace, and ample seating for larger parties and meet-ups. Try them the next time you need a spot for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Thank you Kneaders for putting nuts on my salad when I requested your people to please leave them off, and then to add insult by not giving me my bread.   Damn I wish there was a place closer to get a freakin salad."}
{"text":"Well after seeing this place off of the 95 I thought I'll try it. I looked on their website and thought they had a great selection on their menu. I got there today around 11:15 just to avoid the lunch crowd. When I walked in, I noticed the place seemed a little disorganized. Customers were standing around looking at the menu which you can only see if your in the front of the line. Once I finally got to see the menu, it's very basic it doesn't really tell you a lot about the items food etc. I decided to ask the Cashier about the Ruben panini...she had no idea what I was asking about. She had to go and grab someone else. I know they just opened but really??? How difficult is it to learn what your serving? Then I wanted the sand which on their cheese bread and no sour kraut. That took another 3 minutes how to input that into the register. Then I wanted a chocolate eclair. So just these two items ended up costing me $12.20. This was not a combo etc! WOW! I sit down find a dirty table to sit at...waited another 18 minutes for a very small sand which with a pickle and a few chips. I must say the food is tasty but extremely small in size for the $12.20 price tag. Customer service was non existent and it seems like they have a lot of issues to workout. For this price I could have saved some money and eaten somewhere else or had a bigger meal. I actually walked out of this place starving! I do not think I would come back. Very over priced food for the area and nothing great to go back for."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today before I went for a walk at a near by park. I give them 4 stars and here is why... The location was easy to find and the parking lot was designed to guide traffic efficiently. It was clean with ample parking.   The wait to place my order was minimal and they were busy so I give them credit there too. Besides to your right are these beautiful display cases of delicious baked goods to look over. They also have cute aprons and items for sale too. Plenty to keep your mind off of the minimal wait. The cashiers and food runners were organized and friendly.    I ordered the turkey cranberry croissant and it could not have been any better. It was freshly carved turkey breast with cranberry on a fresh baked flakey croissant.  It was super filling. On my way out I ended up buying two cranberry white chocolate cookies that were equally satisfying.  And it is all about the bread. I also. Light a loaf of white bread and some dinner rolls. I have already had the pleasure of making a sandwich on the bread. The cost is about 3.50 a loaf. It so worth it.  Wish there was one in Summerlin because I would be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"The food was just okay.  It was pleasant looking and tasting, but after seeing crowds every time I tried to visit, nothing really wowed me. The staff was friendly enough, but again, nothing that made me take notice.  I also thought the portion sizes were small for the prices."}
{"text":"This place is nasty, and very expensive! I don't understand the good reviews, they call it mushroom cream a cup of flour boiled in water, waste money! MacDonald's is better than this place."}
{"text":"Love the options at Kneaders - salads, sandwiches, soup.  It is a regular stop for us when we want to pick up something and bring it back home.  I highly recommend the Barbecue Chicken Salad and the French Dip Sandwich...  the Cauliflower Soup is also amazing.  The wait for your food can be a bit long, however, well worth it."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh! I love that they have a drive thru! The atmosphere inside is so cute. My kids love the all you can eat French toast. I love the salads! The fresh bread makes the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I've only had one sandwich so far and it was good, well except for the tomato ( end piece yellowish and mushy) no big deal.  I will be back to try other things.  My son loves the food, but he has the same complaint .....the service.  They are new, I understand, but why open if your staff isn't ready. They have other stores they could have trained in before throwing them to the lions.  Right in the middle of snowbird season in Dysfunction junction.  My son has been there 4 times, he uses the drive-in.  He says it takes forever and they didn't  get the orders right 4 out of 4 times.   Their delivery system needs work, too.  You order, find a seat and soon a server comes wandering thru the place calling your name.  One poor little girl came by 3 times, she looked very embarrassed.  When I realized what was going on, I told her our name, And although it was very busy, she skipped us until she had our food.  They all just look flustered.  I will try them again, because like I said, the sandwich I had was ok and their deserts look o so good.  I may wait awhile until after snowbird season or they get better a little more experience under their belts, which ever comes first.   The thing that turns me off on them the most is that they didn't care enough about their employees to train them properly before opening and making them all look like idiots.  They say they are a \"family\" business but it just seems selfish and greedy to me."}
{"text":"I have to say I was underwhelmed by this place. I was very excited to try a new lunch spot and highly disappointed by my salad. I was surprised when a \"dine in\" salad was served in a plastic togo container on a charger with a hunk of bread with no butter. My salad had 5 ingredients:  grilled chicken (good), feta cheese (barley any), raspberries (5 total), candied pecans (they forgot to put them on), and dressing (yummy).   I think you are better off to eat breakfast here or go with a sandwich. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I Have tried this location three different times. Needless to say I will not be back. First visit they had only been open for a week. They had several employees working however most of them seemed to just walk around looking for something to do. The managers were also oblivious to the poor service that was going on. Helping a customer was not one of them. It took 25 minutes to get our order! They were also out of the soup that I wanted even though it's posted that they still had it. I had to choose another option. On the second visit I decided to try ordering online then going to pick up the food. Online it told me my order would be ready in 15 minutes. After 20 minutes I received a phone call on my phone stating that they were out of the type of bread that I had ordered on the sandwich. They offered a replacement and gave me a free brownie.    Last night on my third and final visit. I once again placed an online order at 6:35 PM. The website told me my order would be ready at 7 PM. I left my home at 7 as I am only a few minutes drive from the location. I arrived at 7:05. Observed not one, not two, not three, but four different employees trying to figure out how to order a sandwich on one register. None of them bothered to look up and ask if they could assist me or the line of customers that was behind me as We were standing there staring at them. I finally interrupted them and said I was there to pick up an online order and did I have to wait for them to figure out how to order a sandwich or could they just get me my food? At this point I got a managers attention who was walking around oblivious to anything that was going on at the restaurant. He then walked up to the four employees and helped them correct whatever problem was wrong on the register. A few moments later I was told my order was still not ready. Keep in mind I placed the order at 6:35 PM and was told it would be ready at 7. I looked at my watch and it was now 7:10. They told me it would be about five more minutes. So I waited. About a minute later they came up to me and informed me that they were once again out of the soup that I had ordered and had been out of it all day long. I then just asked them to refund my entire order. I informed the girl that was assisting me through this entire process that their manager needed to figure out how to manage a business and not make customers constantly have to wait for food. This new restaurant service is so disappointing. The place has good food but they've lost my business."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to stop.  I really don't care for Panera and I got tired of Wildflower, so here I am.  I like the food here and the employees!  My favorite foods so far:   Grilled Cheese on Country White Bread; Raspberry and Chicken Salad; Poppy Seed Muffin Top, Oatmeal Raisan Cookie, Chocolate Cream Pie, Chocolate Bread, Banana Bread, Orange Muffins and my all time favorite ice tea:   Green Tea Ice Tea...    I come here about once a week and just love it..."}
{"text":"I was glad my husband was behind me--pushing me along as I gazed longingly at the incredible pastry selection one must pass before ordering.  I had a salad with bacon, turkey, avocado and over crisp fresh greens. The salad was impressive, but I could only eat half. Next time I will order the 1/2 size. My husband, who is difficult to please, ordered a club sandwich and wouldn't stop talking about how great it was. This huge sandwich had the most beautiful roast beef, turkey, ham cheese and various bits of greenery. He kept telling me how spectacular the bread was (knowing I had already hit my carb limit at breakfast!).He barely got through half and finished the rest for dinner. Prices are reasonable and everything looks so fresh and beautiful. There are so many choices so you can customize what you want and even the pickiest eater can find something delectable. I am seriously thinking of putting in a mile on the treadmill and heading back just  for coffee and something chocolate."}
{"text":"There is Not enough Staff to Accommodate the customers there's always a big long line , And that is because they take your order and that is the only order the are concentrating on , the food is ok the pastries or ok too the Prices are on the high-end"}
{"text":"Update: We were back again for late lunch today and everything was still terrific! The restaurant was clean and comfortable and the staff were all friendly and helpful. Our sandwiches were excellent! My brother had the French Dip and I had turkey with cranberry sauce on a croissant. On Saturdays, pastries are half off! We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Cute spot for lunch with great service, good food, and delicious baked goods.   My friend and I shared everything we ordered. With our meals we were able to make them a combo which added a drink and a cup of soup. Each meal was a nice amount of food.   The service was great. When we ordered the employees helping us were warm and explained different menu options. The restaurant was clean inside too.   The Chicken Salad Croissant Sandwich was good. The croissant was buttery and flaky and the chicken salad was good too. The sandwich came with a small cup of greens and a nice tasting balsamic dressing. The Turkey Artichoke Panini was good and had a nice amount of vegetables on the panini. The chips on the side were good. We both ordered the Roasted Red Pepper Soup and that was really yummy. I'd definitely order that again. To end our meal we enjoyed the Cinnamon Raisin Bread Pudding. This was so good! The texture and cinnamon flavor were great. The glaze on the top was delicious too."}
{"text":"First off I hate leaving bad reviews but for the amount of money spent on two sandwiches and soups for almost 30 bucks I am absolutely disappointed in my food today. I was told through the drive thru that their pesto chicken was on a panini and it ended up being  on sourdough and it was dry as can be. I got their grilled cheese and it wasn't warm or even melted the bread was barely crisp! I am highly disappointed since I've heard so many great things about Kneaders  and to wait in the drive thru for 15-20 mins I should've gotten better food atleast hot food"}
{"text":"I've come here once with my M.I.L. because we wanted a quick bite as she just got in. She wanted something simple so we decided to give Kneaders a try. I got a half a sandwich and salad and she got the Chicken Pesto. Both of us were happy. They had great food that night. I hear they have wonderful dessert, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great selection, very clean, friendly staff! #lfthx, #kneaders"}
{"text":"ordered salad online as I have a short lunch.  Asked for it to be ready at noon.  It was not ready, even though drive through line was 10 minutes long.  Drive thru customer service was less not good.  I asked for side of blue cheese chunks (which apparently they don't have) and Customer service girl seemed annoyed I had the nerve to even ask for it.  Literally 4 croutons in my $6.00 half salad.  Not worth the money, customer service or time.  No I will not go here again"}
{"text":"I called in breakfast yesterday morning, an omelette and iced coffee. They stated it would be ready in 5 minutes. I get there and wait in the long line only to be told, once I finally make it to the front, that I have to go to the register when you walk in (that no one was working at). Food is ready but drink is not, so after waiting another 3-4 minutes, I finally get my drink. I should have known that this would not be a quick grab and go, although I called ahead and he made it sound like it would be.   Try it again tonight for dinner. Pretty excited, not many people in the drive-thru. I order the turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich and the asiago cheese soup. I get home to find no bacon on the sandwich and the wrong soup. Thankfully the roasted red pepper soup was really great.   Overall the food quality has been good. Not exactly sure that it's worth the hype and hassle yet but not ruling it out entirely as of yet."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have a tradition of always going out for Saturday morning breakfast. We recently discovered this place and thought \"hey, we should try it out!\" So we did- and we regretted it lol. It was pretty busy when we got there which is understandable, its a Saturday. So we waited in a long line to order our food. My boyfriend got a plain coffee, I got a hot latte, and we got one sandwich to split. My boyfriend got to get his coffee instantly since they have the coffee out on the counter for you, but I had to wait. In fact, not only did we have to wait quite a bit for our one sandwich, the sever didn't realize I didn't have my latte until after we got our sandwich. So I had to wait an additional 5 or so minutes for my basic hot latte. I was excited to try it, regardless of the wait but boy that latte was HOT! So i couldn't really try it until after we had left the place when it was actually at a drinkable temperature. And thats really sad for me, because I like to drink my coffee while eating. The sandwich we had was some chicken pesto sandwich I can't remember the name- but it was OK overall. Not the greatest, and so not worth the price. Basically, this place is a slightly upgraded Panera. Not worth the price or wait, and mediocre food. Which is super sad because we were excited to try this place out. Save your money, and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Several occasions, I've spent approximately 15mins or more  in the drive thru for just small pastries. Expect to wait regardless of busy hours."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The decor was really nice and they have things you can buy, almost like a mini Cracker Barrel). The bread, salad and soups that our group got was all delicious! I had the Thai chicken salad and a half portion was more than enough. The wait wasn't long before I had my salad. The staff was friendly and the restaurant clean. I really liked this restaurant and will be back!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place out and it was amazing! Food was great! Drive thru lady was nice and funny! Although, they did forget my chips, I'm still very pleased with everything else! I will definitely come back and try it again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love kneaders. Excellent food. Excellent staff. Very clean We used to only be able to get our all time favorite Chunky Cinnamon French Toast when we went to Provo, Utah and we would always stop at Kneaders . Well to say we were excited when Kneaders starting popping up in Arizona is an understatement. Best breakfast is town - chunky cinnamon french toast served with strawberries, whip cream and homemade caramel syrup. If you have teenage or young adult boys you can't go wrong because it is all you can eat for $5.99  we love that there is Kneaders  in North Phoenix. Have you tried Kneaders ? If not you should. You will thank me."}
{"text":"Pastrami on rye and Irish stew were excellent. Going guava smoothie always wonderful. Great customer service. We will be back."}
{"text":"I haven't physically been to this location. So this review is based on the food ordered from here. The first time I had their food was an office lunch. I was the person that put in all of our orders and somehow my order was of course the only one that was incorrect. My salad came with zero dressing. None. Nada. Everone else had a small container of dressing in their salad container. Not me. The 2nd (and most recent time) my order was incorrect again. Also a salad. This time, no croutons. The sandwich was correct and the food tasted very good though. So I'll give them another try, but next time it'll be in person and I'll check my order before leaving."}
{"text":"Great place for Wonderful soups, salads & Good sandwiches! The desserts are out of this world! Clean & friendly staff. I've been eating there at least 3 times a week. Needless to say I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"This was a surprise! I thought it was just the usual bakery and cafe that only serves the pastries or sandwiches. It turned out they actually serves breakfast. Had I known, we wouldve gone there earlier to take advantage of their all you can eat french toast. We arrived there about 15 mins after 11 and they only serve breakfast until 11am. Oh well, I just thought to let everyone know this so you can enjoy their big breakfast meals. As for what I ordered, it was HUGE! I had the turkey avocado sandwhich and made it into a combo with cinnamon roll, coffee, and chips. Boy, I was stuffed! The food was delicious! My husband had the club sandwich and made it a combo with soup and coffee. My son had the cinnamon roll. Everyone was happy. We'll definitely be back there, and this time around, we'll be there early! #LFTHX"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and fast!  The girl who helped me was named Brittany she was so attentive to our order and very friendly!  The food was very delicious, highly recommend! The chicken pesto sandwich was delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Wonderful service! Great atmosphere!!!  I have been here at least 3 times in the past 2 months (which says a lot since I don't go out often). The same kind woman is always there and I wish I knew her name! She wears a head scarf, has the best smile, and is very knowledgeable and attentive!  I always get the chicken pesto panini and tomato soup!! Always delicious!!  Come here if you want great food and great service for good prices!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times, but they always have great service. It's very clean, and you can get a great meal for a good deal. I love their French roast for breakfast with the fresh fruit and the panini is awesome! Oh and if you have a sweet tooth the fruit tarts, brownies, pie, cupcakes are amazing!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, and quite knowledgable. I would highly recommend this bakery for their amazing croissants. I have called ahead and the orders are always fresh when I pick them up. May want to plan ahead during a holiday, they can be very popular."}
{"text":"Tip: don't come here if you're in a hurry.  Now that we have that out of the way, the food is good; The baked goods are really good; The service is 'meh'. I've tried a few different sandwiches here, most of them ok, some disappointing like the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant; there were maybe three cubes of chicken on it. The BLT has been my favorite and the soups are consistently good.   The service is the only consistent downfall. They don't have silverware sitting out so after you've waited 45 mins for your food, you will get it w out a fork or spoon and then you will have to wait another few mins for them to bring it back to you. Little things like asking for a roll w your cup of soup gets pushback because 'a roll doesn't come w a cup of soup.' After waiting 45 mins for your food, that's probably the last thing you need to hear from the server that has no recognition for customer service.   The pastries are very good here. I just think they should work on timeliness, consistency in customer service and the little things like silverware."}
{"text":"This place is really great.  Their breads are delicious and priced very reasonably. I do a lot of marketing so I often call to place a large order and every time I get to the cafe,  my order is done and beautifully wrapped.  Breads are not the only thing they serve, they also have soups, sandwiches, cookies and other goodies.  Need a place to grab a quick bite?  I definitely recommend Kneaders."}
{"text":"Amazing find! Great customer service and logistics for drive through and call in. Possibly the best sandwich shop ive ever been to. Decor is a little nerdy or elderly but who cares. 3rd time here and 3/3 for awesome."}
{"text":"My only complaint is that they are not open on Sundays! Haha :)  Everything I have had from here has been delicious. My favorite is the turkey cranberry croissant sandwich and their potato soup. Their fruit tarts are super yummy too!  The employees have been very very sweet and welcoming every time I have been there and have been super patient when I take too long deciding what I want. :) 10/10!"}
{"text":"I am always down for a good Thai Chicken salad from kneaders. I also love their deserts, especially the fruit tart and bread pudding. A perfect place for a ladies lunch or a date night after visiting the Gilbert Temple."}
{"text":"A friend had recommended this place and I'm glad I finally went and tried it out. This location seemed to be much newer and was rather clean inside. You order at the counter and your food is delivered right to your table. They have a coffee and tea station and a good menu selection for comfort breakfast and lunch. My boyfriend and I both ordered the \"all-you-can-eat\" French Toast. However, the toast is so thick-cut you might barely be able to finish the initial two slices. It is accompanied by delicious \"homemade\" brown sugar syrup that is not too sweet, but just right and fresh whipped can and strawberries. I ordered a Chai Tea Latte along with it and their drinks are coffee shop quality.   Apart from their menu, they have small, cute selection of knick knacks that you can purchase while you're there. The selection changes every so often, so keep going back to see what's new!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Yelp, so this review is a tad late. However, I got to experience Kneader's pre opening breakfast & lunch. We were greeted with warm smiles and a huge hello. The restaurant is absolutely stunning, inside and out. The employees are friendly, upbeat, and very helpful. My boyfriend and I had their chunky cinammon french toast & it was delicious. The toast is baked fresh in the morning from scratch and they make their own syrup as well. The lunch was even better, which I didn't believe was possible. All around, amazing experience."}
{"text":"Love the fresh food at Kneaders! The French toast is to die for! I only wish they would come up with some gluten free bread and baked good options. There is so much deliciousness there that I don't get to eat now since having to go gluten-free.  Great atmosphere for a fast-ish food type restaurant! Clean and homey feeling."}
{"text":"Terrible Mocha, it literally tastes like dirt. I ordered a large and it was only filled half way."}
{"text":"This is my new addiction. Picture Panera Bread company but fresh and with a farmhouse feel. A family member told me about it 2 weeks ago and I've already been in three times.  It's just off of Craig and 95 which is less than an 8 minute drive from me (dangerous) and has a drive-thru (even more dangerous).  Everything is made in-house fresh, you can definitely taste it and if you choose to dine inside the decor is ADORABLE.   Henderson friends, there's a location near you :)   My new go-to stop while we're out."}
{"text":"I have a general rule about not trying out a new place until it's been opened at least a month. I broke that rule and had an early dinner here tonight. Even tho they have only been open for a few days, we had the same quality service and food as we've come to expect. I tried the Irish Stew. It was delicious. The carrots were cut into about 1 inch in size and were kind of hard to eat but it didn't distract from the flavor. I still enjoyed it. I'm taking home a caramel apple and hope it's as good as I've had from other locations. My daughter had the kids grilled cheese and devoured it. The staff is trying their hardest to hustle. There were a few hiccups but you can see they are clearly working hard and trying. Despite the fact they just opened last week, the line out the door moved very quickly."}
{"text":"I don't get some of the negative reviews. I don't think it was bad. The only reason why I'm giving it 3  1/2 stars is because they do not have wi-fi. The place is perfect for breakfast!  Very spacious and clean. I had dinner here today after my long bike ride. I ordered the child's meal because I didn't want to get a big portion. I got the grilled cheese sandwich with grapes, and a small cup of roasted tomato and gouda soup. Totally hit the spot!  They have a bike rack in the back which is great. Nice to see that Arcadia is booming with new businesses. Hope to come here again next time, and hopefully, they'll add free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Live nearby so I thought I'd try it as it just opened.  Went the first or second day and bought a turkey sandwich.  A LOT of bread and very (I mean very very) little turkey -- a few quarter size 'blobs' (not 'slices' !!??).  Wasn't cheap either.  Hard to believe others liked the turkey sandwich.  Maybe they ran out of turkey?   Also, not able to get mustard.  Weird.   Anyway, that's it for me.  THere are other MUCH nicer places to go for lunch."}
{"text":"Wow! Is this a hidden secret? So I'm sure you've tried different places that have bread soup sandwiches salads and this place is going to blow all of those others out of the water! I love soup. I love broccoli soup. Kneaders bakery and café has an out of this world broccoli cream soup. I didn't even use my spoon I cupped it it was so good! I ordered the pastrami on sourdough and wow my mouth watered just writing about it again. I can't wait to go back especially to try their breakfast. They have breakfast sourdough pancakes!?! Yes please! Also thank you for being drive-through thank you for having friendly staff and thank you for being my new favorite spot"}
{"text":"Ordered a turkey cranberry sandwich for $6.99 and it came with one piece of lettuce, cheese and about a tablespoon of turkey. They should be ashamed to serve this. Will not be going back. They lost another customer."}
{"text":"Delicious baking goods , awesome salads and sandwiches . One of my favorites . You can get great gifts for friends, family and neighbors. Fresh bakery, sinful desserts yummy"}
{"text":"ordered a slice of pie and a cappuccino from the drive thru.  cappuccino had sticky syrup dripping down the side and a thumb print on the mouth hole of the lid.  it tasted watery and sugary like gas station cappuccino.  attaching a photo of the pie which tasted like  chocolate dipped donut in pie form.  not in a good way."}
{"text":"While it's barely been open a week, be warned, it is crazy busy!  We went on Saturday afternoon around 2pm and the line was out the door. Waited about 15 minutes in line to order and 15 minutes to get our food to eat there. We asked for a chocolate eclair ontop of our sandwich combo, which was delicious if I might add, but we didn't get it. Luckily we  weren't charged for it. Big portions for the sandwiches, especially the Focaccia. Pastrami was great. Try and come off peak hours to avoid the crowd, around 3pm - 3:30pm when the crowd is leaving. Food and service was good overall, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"We've given this place so many chances but every time we've ordered drive through there has been missing food and the wrong something. I've also ordered kids combo and twice gotten grapes with mold. First time found out while my son was eating them and the second time I checked first so to make sure and sure enough again. Please check the food before you give to customer. And parents check the food before your children start eating."}
{"text":"Scott the manager provided exceptional customer service. I was extremely pleased with his friendly demeanor and customer service. He made my trip to Kneaders fantastic!"}
{"text":"Called in ahead to pick up a loaf of ciabatta bread for later after running errands. The girl on the phone said it would be best to pay for it now over the phone because they'll run out. So, around 5:30 PM my friend and I showed up, she stood in line while I hung out by the pick up section.  After a couple minutes of no one coming by or acknowledging me I just stood in the food line with my friend. We finally get up front and they handed me my order and my friend ordered some desserts so we sat down. The place is really clean and the employees were friendly. Their brownies are really moist and tasty. I would have picked up something too (I had my eye on their blueberry lemon loaf) but nothing was priced and the line was long so I didn't bother asking. The ciabatta bread was super fresh and tasty, id come again to check out their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Kneaders and I have a love/hate relationship. Their desserts are fantastic. So delicious and so bad for me. Their Key Lime tart and Raspberry pie are unbelievable but you just can't go wrong here. They include one of their amazing chocolate chip cookies with all the meals and you can try out other desserts in their sample section located next to the cashier. Nice espresso drink options. Their iced mocha is pretty good. Also, all the fresh brewed ice teas are delicious. Green tea is 100% healthy - no additives and no sweeteners.   You can order online, they have a drive through, and can cater. I can't tell them how much business they get of mine just because I can feed my family without getting everyone out of the car. Kids meal bundles are loaded - sandwiches or soups, drink options, fruit, cookies, and a toy.   If you're looking for a cute present for a girlfriend - this is definitely a place to check out. Surprised? I was too. Jewelry, house goods, aprons, and they will wrap it for you too.   The reason they aren't 5 stars for me is that I can fatten up easily here but I can't slim down. Even their veggie sandwich has mayo on it. Only healthy breakfast option is oatmeal but you have to request no sugar ,just berries. Even their salads come with bacon or ranch or sour cream based dressings. Yes, I could pick things off and request no croutons or rolls or bread but it would be nice if I could receive the full entree I paid for without having to pay for things I don't want."}
{"text":"I have a favorite soup here. However they almost never have it when I come. They only have it 2 days a week and it doesn't matter what time I come they don't have it. Today I even called before I drive there and was told yes we have it. Only to find out when I arrived that it's not ready. I've ordered online multiple time and I get to the store and it's not available."}
{"text":"We eat at kneaders on average three times a week. Very clean food and fresh breads and such. I am a deli rat myself and I must say the wife turned me on to this place.  It's no Katz deli with the foot and a half of pastrami stacked (which I love) but again clean and fulfilling. The one Snark I have is if you go within an hour of closing time they are usually out of all of their signature items (turkey, croissants, soups) drive-through line can be long it's hit or miss. The employees are all very nice. Definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service. We ordered a cake that was already made and a brownie that was already made. According to the receipt we waited 15 minutes.  This is the third time we've come and didn't have to wait in line. The first 2 times it was packed and the line hardly moved in 20 minutes, so we left.  We figured this time it would be in and out...not so.  We were given extra brownies for the wait. That was appreciated. But, for the items already prepared, It really should have been in and out. While there was quite a few people working,  only one was taking orders and one was getting them together. Something they might want to work on."}
{"text":"This place is hit-or-miss. The salads are really good, but only when they use fresh lettuce. The past 2 times I've had to take back my salads to have them remade.The sandwiches are usually pretty good, and we enjoy the free dessert samples. Unfortunately, the tables never seem to be clean. We always have to wipe our table down ourselves before we can sit down."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times since they opened normally it is good however, tonight was disappointing-The French Onion soup first was not hot and I had to stand  at the side counter and wait for someone to get a hot soup to me... Then when I started eating I discovered It was TOO SALTY!   I should have had a salad but was hoping the soup would have been good!  What a sad dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and French toast!  Not a fan of the soup. Favorite sandwich is the turkey avocado--my husband and I order it on the baguette. Sandwich is huge!  Great for leftovers. Went to this location for the first time today. Tried a key lime tart and it was yummy!  Love that it has a drive thru."}
{"text":"I went here twice. The first time was bad, lack of properly trained people at both the register and the bread area. At the bread ordering area I stood for at least 5 minutes while 2 people behind the counter just did busy work glancing over at me occasionally until I had had enough and asked if either of them could help me order a loaf of bread. There were at least 4 different bad experiences during that trip.  Yesterday I was driving past and thought I would give it another try, thinking they were just learning. After spending $10 on breakfast I got food poising, (first time in 15 years) and I vomitted over 20 times during the course of the day and evening. I know it was them that caused it as it was the only thing I had eaten. Needless to say I won't be back. Stay away if you don't want to be sick from eating their food!!!!!! I haven't had problems at the surprise location."}
{"text":"I hardly ever write reviews, but I went to this location for the second time today and my order was totally butchered both times by different people! Today (drive thru) they forgot my bread, put the wrong cheese on my salad, charged my an \"upsize\" fee for a large coffee then said they only had one size, and the coffee was completely white with creamer/undrinkable. Last time (a couple weeks ago, dine in) was even more off, and we waited for sooo long for our order that the kids were tired of being there before we even got our food. It's so disappointing because I usually love Kneader's and this is the closest one to me. We won't be going again."}
{"text":"Soup was warm not hot and they always run out of the good soup. The sandwiches hardly have meat on them and way over priced. I have wrote the company and they do not respond at all, rude! They apparently do not care they just want your money. MORONS!!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are terrible. Breakfast sandwiches are decent. Wildflower bread company is way better."}
{"text":"Went here with some girls friends on a Wed evening. We usually go to PB Bakery...but wanted a change. Of course it's very hard not to compare the two. Overall I think the portions of soup and sandwich were smaller than I expected. I had the Gorgonzola mushroom soup and it had great flavor. I also had the vegetarian sandwich...I am pretty sure they forgot the cucumber...but I usually pick that out so all was good. There was about a 2 minute wait and they were out of detailed menus but the staff did their best to guide you through what was on everything. The best part of the experience...the apple bread pudding!!! WOW! I will he back for that...and to try breakfast!! 3 stars because I think they are a little overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"First time for us to visit. The owner and staff are very nice. We tried some breakfast and I was good! We will come back again soon!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this Kneaders since it opened, January 15th of 2016. They have always had the best food, and service. I am greeted right as I enter the building almost every time. Their food has almost never let me down. Yes there are some items I am not a huge fan of, though that is to be expected with every establishment. Now the customer service is extraordinary. The staff treats you as their number one priority, and deals with issues in a professional and over the top manner. I will definitely be recommending this location to every I know, as well as the brand in a whole. Glad to see businesses to doing things right!"}
{"text":"This is a great Kneader's location. All of the staff are so friendly and accommodating. I tried the chicken pesto panini for the first time and it was amazing! I can't believe I've never tried this before. It was so cheesy and the pesto was delicious - I just wish there was more! I will definitely be coming back for this sandwich."}
{"text":"Sitting in kneaders right now. After a 45 minute wait, we received our food. Two ham and cheese croissant sandwiches two smoothies and a breakfast sandwich. Absolutely ridiculous. When I went to the counter to ask what is taking so long, they replied most people order online. What?? Then why am I standing here with 5 other disgruntled customers? Another woman who has waited as long as me said she wanted a refund and was going to leave. They handed her her food. No offer of a discount free brownie or cookie for her wait. Unbelievable. I will not be back, and I live around the corner."}
{"text":"This is a good place for a really large and inexpensive sandwich on fresh homemade bread with a good selection and an amazing bakery display guaranteed to destroy anyone's diet! LOL I try to eat here when I'm on that area of town, and I have never been disappointed in the food is here. When I order a side of soup I do wish that it would be a bigger cup than the tiny little portion that is served. They've been busy every single time I've been there whether it's in the morning afternoon or evening. Sometimes it's chaotic, but they're serving time is reasonable. I recommend them for their sandwiches and they become one of my favorites."}
{"text":"What is better than fresh bread? Prices are high but from how much my bf loved his sandwich I say worth it. I am vegetarian so didn't order anything. They had a couple menu items I would eat but rarely eat out anyways but got some really yummy sourdough and had some delicious toast all week. Sweet breads were great, deserts were good but pricey."}
{"text":"Although I waited 35 min in the drive thru lane to order it was not until I received my chicken salad sandwich on a baguette that was the huge turn-off. Half a baguette, with lettuce and tomato (tomato was extra) and hardly any chicken salad. I was taking bites without any of the chicken salad because so little was put on! Cost was 8.41 including a bag of chips and tax. Not worth your time and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in Kneaders lately. The last two times I've gone I've had to wait ten minutes in the drive through with issues. This last time I ordered a sandwich I was really craving, waited ten minutes in line and then when I got to the window I was told they didn't have the bread that comes with that sandwich. That's terrible customer service and could've been communicated at the intercom so I could have backed up. Then no one even said sorry, a blonde lady looked at me and said, \"Ok, so we're good, then?\" With a snarky attitude. It was 8 pm I get it, it's late and your annoyed but there's a thing called customer service. If you don't have it work somewhere else. Something else offered would have been nice especially after wasting my time."}
{"text":"Kneaders is a great place for a healthy, quick lunch. They have a drive thru for convenience when you're in a hurry, but it's hard to beat the ambiance inside too. They have a cute little gift shop with novelty items, gift baskets, decor and more that is always changing with the seasons and makes every trip unique. The staff are attentive, helpful, and beyond friendly. They recommended the Thai Chicken Salad on my last trip, which was delicious, fresh, and ready by the time I finished browsing the gift shop. Extremely reasonably priced and it lasted me two lunches!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent! Just be warned, there is always a long line, so if you are trying to have a quick bite, skip Kneaders.  They have a very large menu filled with a lot of different sandwiches, soups, salads, breads, pastries, deserts....... pretty big menu for a bakery/café. I enjoyed a bowl of their tomato basil, ravioli soup, along with their French Dip. The soup was very tasty, I just felt like it was a little watery, thicken it up some more and you would have a perfect tomato soup. The sandwich was definitely filling, but I feel like that was all bread. The bread was very thick and soft, but I feel like it was a little much for it took away from the inside of the sandwich, which was the roast beef and cheese. Along with the au jus sauce this was a pretty decent sandwich I just like my sandwiches with more meat/filling and less bread. Last but not least of all I finished up lunch with one of their double fudge brownies! You can not go into this place and not order some kind of sweat treat! THEY ARE EVERYWHERE! The double fudge brownie was moist, very chocolaty and...... lets just say warmed my soul! LOL!  The only thing I dislike about this place is the \"home décor\" they have for sale in the center of the café. The café is quite busy, so they could definitely use the space for tables and chairs for their customers to eat. It's a cute little touch to make the café a little more homey/country feeling, but it takes up a lot of space and makes the café feel quite enclosed with all the small pictures, plaques, aprons and little knickknacks for sale."}
{"text":"I love this place, much like a Paneras.   My only big critics is the lack of nutritional info - none posted in the restaurant and the online tool is awkward to use.  Nothing I looked up included full data - for example the mg for potassium totally absent.  My husband has to limit both sodium & potassium so for us it's a big issue   The place seems clean, food fresh, staff friendly.   I'll have to limit future visits to when my husband isn't with me however!"}
{"text":"Idk why people complain about this place so much I've never had a problem at either of the east valley locations. I've had the French toast and it is AMAZING the syrup is even better, my daughter liked the pancakes, breakfast sandwich on a croissant was great, the cinnamon rolls are mediocre not worth the calories or money. I've had a couple different sandwiches all were great, tried the artichoke portobello soup  tonight and it's pretty tasty, chicken noodle soup is really good too. My daughter and I shared a mint brownie and it was pretty good, wish the mint layer was thicker though. I've also had the apple bread pudding which was good, would be amazing with a good creamy bourbon sauce. The line is long but it goes pretty quick, my biggest issue is that there isn't someone making sure to wipe the tables off when someone leaves, tables are always dirty; and tonight it was FREEZING in there, I heard several people complain and move tables to try and find a seat that wasn't soo cold. In the summer that wouldn't be a complaint :)"}
{"text":"Wife & I decided to go here for dinner & grab a sandwich and some treats.  1. The potato bread was simply amazing with actual real potatoes in the bread!  2. The sandwiches we ordered were worth the price at around $8.00 they were absolutely delicious and stuffed with great fresh ingredients.  Easily one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.   3. The staff appeared to still be quite new, and I was not really impressed with the service overall.  In fact like others have said it's a bit confusing when walking in as far as how you order, etc.   4. The 5 pastries we purchased overall were outstanding.  Our favorite being the double fudge brownies..WOW!!  Best brownies we have ever had in our life!  The worst pastry was the cinnamon roll, not really impressed at all & I've had better ones from Smiths grocery store.  Overall we were impressed & will defiantly be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food here ok, about what I expected.  The prices are good compared to places like Panera and Zuppa's.  My only complaint is the cashier lady was very dismissive, bordering on rude.  The food isn't good enough to deal with that."}
{"text":"First time at this cute sandwich shop.  Decent selection and yummy fresh breads. House baked chips were also delish.   Definitely want to come back to try breakfast. #lfthx"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place as my Panera alternative! I'm hooked on their soups and sandwiches but have yet to try their breakfast and pastries/sweets.   Both drive thru and eat in is always a good experience. I've never had a line in the drive thru, and although the two customers in front of me in store seemed to have MAJOR bread malfunctions (is it that difficult to order?) my cashier helped me wonderfully (wanted sour dough bread and they have an alternative). Also, samples of soup and bread!! YES!   The classic turkey sandwich is a favorite of mine and I've had all of their soups, coconut chicken being my favorite (Thai soup).  Ingredients are fresh, bread is delicious, and portions are plentiful!  Really glad we have a location this far north as we are lacking in good options."}
{"text":"First time ordering from Kneaders. I got the Thai Chicken Salad and their Chicken coconut curry soup. Both were amazing! I'm actually surprised by how flavorful the soup is. The service was great! Will definitely be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Good but 1 star for this location as they don't keep up with their daily items or hygiene.  They make a batch of cranberry sauce for their turkey croissant sandwich once a week but they've always run out whenever I've asked for that sandwich.  They say they usually have enough but sometimes somebody \"spills it\" and then they don't have any the rest of the week.  It's Monday right after lunch and they don't have it.  No apologies, just they don't have it.  They also run out of tea a lot, too.  Last visit I found a blonde hair inside my sandwich. Very poor customer service and upkeep with their duties and following their posted signs about wearing hairnets and not being on their cell phones.  Needs better management."}
{"text":"We were so excited for a Kneaders to move into the neighborhood. We used to drive to the Greenfield location. However, this Kneaders is not the same as the Greenfield location. Food quality is inconsistent. We hoped it would get better with time, but it really hasn't changed.   For example... We love Kneaders French toast. We typically get it to go. The wait in the drive thru line is ridiculously long. (This seems to be the case no matter when you go to this specific Kneaders.) The French toast will be hot and fresh one time and barely warm the next. The last time we had it they did not even make it out of their famous cinnamon-swirl bread. Whatever bread they did use was so hard on an entire edge it was inedible.   Another example... On the two occasions we have purchased the chocolate domes. They tasted stale. At least day (likely more) old. Both times they were not completely full of mousse and the chocolate bottom was dry and crumbly.   Sandwiches seem fairly consistent. My favorite is the turkey, bacon, avocado. Only problem is when I ask for no onions I still get onions... Every. Single. Time."}
{"text":"I give Kneaders 2 stars for convenience.  The quality and quantity of a tuna sandwich has gone from a 10 to a 1 with 1 being an unacceptable rating. This decline has happened since my first visit on opening day three weeks ago to my 6th visit last evening. I eat out every day and Kneaders has moved to the bottom of the list (restaurant of last resort)."}
{"text":"I've really enjoyed their customer service lately. I ordered a catering order that went smoothly with the delivery. They even gave me extra food! The rewards program gives you some Kneaders credit back on every purchase. I really like the baked good options. It's a great place for desserts. And they also carry gift items (like frames, trinkets, decor) if you ever need to pick up a gift. Do yourself a favor, and stop in!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been to this kneaders (probably 4x in the last 6 months) they have always been out of sugar cookies. The billboard says kids meals come with sugar cookie, which is what my son wants but... They are out!! So chocolate chip instead... It's frustrating. Also, plan on at least 15 minutes MINIMUM in the drive through - but usually way longer."}
{"text":"Omg the French toast are the bomb the best I've ever had they are very thick like I like and that homemade syrup I highly recommend them..."}
{"text":"Kneader's was ok. The fresh bread was delicious however. Would probably go back to buy their home made bread. Will go back to try breakfast."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite bakery/café/sandwich/salad restaurant. I have ordered from them several times when I have bought my team lunch, and it is always a hit. The bread is so fresh and soft and delicious. I want to take a nap in it. The salads have lots of fresh greens and protein. The bakery items are amazing. Truly. And when you go to pay, there are always a couple of samples of the bakery items..I usually try one of each! There is a really cute store with kitschy items as well, and after the holidays they go on sale for crazy cheap. Overall it kind of reminds me of my Grandma's house, in the best possible way."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, but wont be my last. I had the Chicken Tortilla Soup, Caesar salad and a Canoli. All are worth getting.   And the service was outstanding"}
{"text":"My son loves this place. The turkey sandwich is made from real turkey rather than lunch meat, which is a nice change from typical sandwich places. Also, they are very happy to replace a sandwich if it doesn't come out as desired.   Their chicken noodle and portobello artichoke soups are delicious, and their bread ends make great toast. Just be sure to get them early, because they sell out."}
{"text":"Kneaders French toast is my favorite way to start the weekend! And when I eat at kneaders,  I can have additional slices at no additional cost! I love the fresh strawberries and homemade whipped cream on top!"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times both for breakfast and lunch.  They do not have a big breakfast menu and for lunch, they have some typos and they kind of lie to you on the menu as some of their salads say they have dried cranberries which I love the sour taste of dried cranberries but in fact they are not cranberries at all but high in sugar cran-raisins which is a big difference and I have talked to the management about this and they know about it but refuse so far to correct their menus.  The ordering is pretty simple but when you make an adjustment to the food as I did today, they do not know how to handle special orders so be very careful.  Also the manager does not seem to know how to interact with customers much, he always wants to argue with them rather than being cooperative.  They need to train their staff much better, the food is def good love all the free specialty bread and the atmosphere wish they had pillows on the booths as they are very hard wood."}
{"text":"My first and only experience failed to meet my expectations.  My whole meal, both doors to the restaurant were propped open and I have since noticed them open when I drive by.  I just find that to be unappetizing, so I don't even consider eating here, which is a shame, because I had looked forward to its opening.  The one meal I had was grilled cheese with potato soup and a drink, which was ok, but the service was fair at best and the restaurant just didn't meet my overall expectations."}
{"text":"Love the food here, if you are looking for a GOOD sandwich/soup/pastry this is the spot to get it. I was really surprised by how good all the food has been. My two favorites so far are the French dip and chocolate moose dome."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and it was in search of a good bakery place. I got the Hot Raspberry Bread Pudding ($3.99 and the napoleon ($3.99). I love bread pudding, in general. So, it was tasty enough for me, although I had better before. The napoleon was just okay... I let me friend have a bite and he also thought it was just okay... IF we ever go back here, we probably wouldn't get that again."}
{"text":"There's plenty of better options in the same plaza. I wouldn't eat here again. They are out of most of their items on their menu. Staff is not friendly and seems annoyed with customers. Only got 2 stars because of their desserts."}
{"text":"So awesome. Love coming here for the Ruben. Desserts always yummy.  Staff is wonderful. My favorite local cafe."}
{"text":"Loved my salad! I got the Chicken Raspberry Nut salad and a Green Tea; a perfect lunch it was.  The customer service could be improved; a simple smile would do!  Overall, convenient location and lovely options for lunches."}
{"text":"The days of Paradise Bakery and Panera Bread are over my friends! If you haven't been to kneaders you are missing out. They have a drive through but I urge you to park and go inside so you can get the full experience. The pastry case is lined with gorgeous deliciousness and they have really cute knick knacks for sale! Lots of ice tea choices as well. I've been here twice now, once for breakfast, and once for lunch, both times were perfect! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because the white guy who served us was a rude condescending asshole. I'm not sure who he is, maybe a manager because he wore a tie. At least the other waitresses are nice."}
{"text":"We love Kneaders! Their baked goods are beautiful & delicious. They have phenomenal breakfast (& lunch/dinner!). There are always super cute gifts & decor items in the store too! Yesterday I tried their American omelet & it exceeded my expectations! It was also big enough to share with my daughter, which was awesome considering it was around $5. It also came with toast & orange slices! I don't think this place gets nearly enough credit but it's a gem that we really enjoy. As a bonus, they have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Wow,  what a place,  almost token back, as this, be my first time of many times, the place looks and has such a great feeling to it, for sure a place that is great to start the morning and start your day off right and hay, even end your day, to start a day that much more great, just by eating dinner from their; okay okay, lol, simply, yes, a great place, with great CS, clean areas all around and a great place to sit and enjoy a meal or even just a cup of tea"}
{"text":"First off, I have been here a few times and for the most part the food has been pretty good.  I really enjoy the french toast for breakfast.  Today, however, I went in for breakfast (all you can eat french toast).  I was with my young son.  It took over 10 minutes to bring out my french toast.  While I was eating I noticed a large caravan of Mormon Missionaries arrive for breakfast.  I waited till they were all done ordering and went up and asked for 1 more piece of french toast.  I sat there and waited and waited.  Meanwhile, they kept bringing plate fulls of french toast refills to the Mormon boys even though their original order was after mine, by about 10 minutes.  So, I went up to the counter to cancel my refill  due to time constraints and the worker says, \"Oh, you didn't get your refill yet?\".  No, because you guys were to busy taking care of the Mormon boys and ignoring me.  Now, I have no problem with the Mormon boys, but since this place is owned by Mormons, I couldn't help but think they were getting preferential treatment over myself who was being ignored.  Not happy about that and unsure if I will return.  There are plenty of other good places out there who treat all their customers equally."}
{"text":"Tried the French toast, very tasty!  They have this butter infused syrup that tastes so rich and savory!  And it pairs well with their coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great service! I feel that it is good value for the price. French toast is awesome but only served until 11am. I highly recommend the turkey, bacon, acacia do sandwich. yum!"}
{"text":"Kneaders is hella underrated! I came for the first time today. I got a club sandwich with pomegranate berry iced tea. You can never go wrong with a club - it totally met my expectations. The tea was the star of the show imo. It's fruity and super flavorful but not sugary. It's actually quite similar to Pita Jungle's tea, but even better. Hard to imagine, I know. Oh! And they have pastries! Like real fresh pastries like fruit tarts and mini bundts and something called orange rolls (looked BOMB but didn't get it).  The staff was also really friendly! Girlfriend at the counter was literally a cashier out of a commercial. I swear she's either getting a raise, or just got one.   The ONLY downside is that they don't have wifi.  Still, I really doubt I'll go back to a Panera after this. Ate the whole sandwich, I'm full, and I don't even look 3 months pregnant. This is great."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous quick lunch at Kneaders. The place has quite a bit of charm with cookbooks lining shelves and items such as cute kids aprons. While I waited in line to order, I couldn't resist looking at all the scrumptious desserts. I ended up enjoying my Thai chicken salad. It was crisp and fresh and a very good portion. I also grabbed a cinnamon roll for my kids for after school pickup! I couldn't resist, it looked too good not to come home w"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Kneaders. I had the turkey bacon avocado on focaccia bread. The service was prompt. The sandwich was yummy, but I asked for it to be without onions so I had to pick them off. Also, I think next time I'll ask for it to be warmed up. Otherwise, a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here nearly every Saturday morning. The French toast is all you can eat and tastes amazing. Plus it is very reasonably priced. Comes with two slices of thick cinnamon bread toast with a side of syrup, and a side of strawberries in cream. I normally am full with the first plate however. I have also had the turkey sausage and egg sandwich on a croissant which is great. I like to have a protein with breakfast and you don't get one with the French toast but you can add a side of sausage which is good. Everyone is friendly, and food is always good. I have come here after work at times to pickup some cannoli or other pasties or a Sandwich too. I really like the Chicken, cheese, and ham on ciabatta roll. Definitely worth stopping to check it out. My wife likes to shop her too, they have an area with seasonal items for sale along with loves of bread etc."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I had the Turkey, Bacon and Avocado on Focaccia. The bread is very fresh and delicious and the turkey is whole breast and tasty. The restaurant has a very charming decor and the staff is extremely nice. As for the desserts, If you like chocolate I recommend the double fudge brownie and if chocolate is not your thing, the key lime tart is amazing!"}
{"text":"Better than I thought. Very fresh food which we all enjoyed. Turkey avacado sandwich was great but lacked enough meat. Wife and I both had broccoli cheddar soup which was definitely good. Overall good food just a little slow and overpriced."}
{"text":"The management is terrible! Staffing is always short. Wanted me to pay an extra $1.50 for strawberry/whip cream. Food is just ok. I won't be back. Goin' to Paradise."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried to eat here a couple of months ago, but learned that they are closed on Sundays.  That IS the day many people go out to breakfast; or go to lunch after church.  But okay....  My friend and I came here for lunch yesterday.  She recommended that I buy only half a salad.  That was a good recommendation as I left most of it.  I ordered the turkey cranberry salad.  There were a lot of chunks of white turkey meat, cranberries, Spring Mix for the greens, onion slices, and mushrooms.  My friend thinks the salad also included tofu.  I don't know.  What I do know is that I would have liked twice as much dressing.  I also know that it was hard to eat with a small plastic fork and a small plastic knife, especially since the bowl was so deep and so light  (plastic).  The reason I left so much of my salad isn't because it was too filling; it's because it was too damn hard to eat.  The salad came with a single slice of bread.  They have a nice selection of soft drinks.  The parking lot is pretty easy to maneuver; but it can be hard to get into if you have to make a left across Eastern coming out of Anthem.  Just be patient and be safe.  When you leave, be patient.  The place was clean enough; and the staff efficient.  I don't see myself becoming a regular because, when I order a salad, I want to be able to eat it with ease.  Cheap metal utensils would be better for the environment as well as ease of use by the customer."}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to the neighborhood...  -Great location  -drive thru service -staff are all friendly and welcoming  -quick service  -amazing pastry case with an option for every sweet tooth -comfortable environment  -solid menu with lots of soups, salads, and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I am quickly becoming a fan of Kneaders Bakery.  Having taken several friends here over the past month dining in, as well as purchasing some baked goods for gifts, I find this is a pretty good alternative to other bakeries we have in town, and the main difference being that this one is definitely for eating in.  1. Breakfasts - Some pancakes, french toast and egg dishes and then sandwiches and oatmeal, the place does have some breakfast selections. I did not order any, since they were serving their normal sandwiches already.  2. Selection - A very good selection of sandwiches and salads and soup as well, although I did not have any soup.  Turkey Bacon Avocado on Focaccia bread - A large stacked sandwich that looked great but hard to eat.  The sandwich kept falling apart.  The good news is that it was tasty and it was large. I took the rest home.  The turkey and bacon was very tasty. I wonder how to order these with the right type of sauce or spread or dressing.  I did not sense there was a way to customize it.  Club Sandwich - This is also a very large sandwich with Roast beef, turkey, ham cheese and the bits and bobs.  Very tasty and I really enjoyed this one which I had the first time I came in here.  2. Soups and salads  they have plenty of choices of salads and they have soups of the day or their normal soups. You can order combination of soup and half sandwich.  I did not order this style, as we were in groups and sharing some items.  3. What is missing  Not much, although with their sandwiches, all you get is the sandwich. If you want chips, cookies or something with it, you should order it separately.  Good selection of iced teas, organic teas and your standard soda fountain in a self serve drink area.   Once you pay, they will deliver the items to your table.  There is also a Kneaders frequent card that you can sign up for free. I have it and will see how that goes!  GK says, check it out."}
{"text":"I thought let's go here and try this place out. First off we walk in and no one even looked at us to say welcome even though there's two people looking at us that work there. So we went up to put our order in and i went with Panini Chicken Pesto. It was to come with grilled chicken breast fresh pesto ,fresh basil, tomatoes, red onions and provolone cheese on a sourdough bread. To say the least i wasn't happy because mine don't come with all the stuff on it at . My food was over cooked they burnt the bread. And what little they did put on wasn't fresh at all. It looked like they just throw it on and sent it out.  Will not be going back here anymore."}
{"text":"This place had me totally excited but left me wanting at every turn I truly was not please .. Service at lunch was super slow , my turkey salad tasted like it had old turkey and the raspberry rolls I purchased legit were not worth the money ..   Definitely recommend you drive to panera instead"}
{"text":"I'm not sure about how to review this place. The set up is great, clean and friendly. All the selections look delicious and everything I have tried has been good  One big thing, every time we eat here both myself, my daughter as well as some friends end up with stomach problems. We aren't sure if it's the flour or leavening agent they use. We keep trying though because everything tastes great."}
{"text":"First time we went we ordered a few things Togo. They got one of my sons sandwich wrong (put mayo on it when I said none and they said it would be hot but it was cold) I had to make him something else when we got home which was a waste and a bummer.  So make sure to check your Togo orders before you leave! Went back for breakfast and my son had the French toast which he loved and it really was pretty tasty.  Prices are pretty good too! I love the look of the store inside and all its little charm and goodies. Most of all I'm beyond excited to have another place (bonus with a a drive thru) near anthem! We need more restaurants!!"}
{"text":"I have been sitting in the drive thru for 15 minutes.  no matter how good the sandwiches I cannot come back and risk being late for work."}
{"text":"Ordered online yesterday and was so impressed!! I read some reviews before ordering, and was hoping that I would get the chance to see Amy in action and I totally did! She's great and totally deserves a raise or something!! Oh and the fruit tarts are good too!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, pastries we're excellent, but the customer service is what will bring me back to Kneaders. Tiffany was fun, knowledgeable, and very helpful.  Thank you, Tiffany!"}
{"text":"This place is great !!! Soup is awesome and the chicken salad does NOT have fruit in it.. PERFECT !!"}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious.  Breakfast french toast or croissant sausage egg & cheese.  The French dip is one of my favorites, but their baked goods are even better.  The chocolate dome is a chocolate lovers dream.  Service is quite good.  Been here many times and glad it's close to home."}
{"text":"This was my first Kneaders experience. The food was tasty and the cashier was super friendly. I was eyeing some of the treats in the case and wish I had gotten one. I will be back for that. I also loved the atmosphere of the restaurant with the cute items for sale.   My only negative is they were having issues with a number calling their phone non-stop and instead of answering and hanging up or taking the phone off the hook, they let it ring non-stop the entire 30+ minutes I was in the restaurant. I am sure it was frustrating for them, but it turned out to be a very annoying background noise."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of panera bread kind of the same concept just more expensive. The food was really good, their actual sandwiches are actually really big so for the price I think it's worth it"}
{"text":"This place is great! This was my first visit to a Kneaders, and I loved it! I had a turkey sandwich, chicken noodle soup, a drink, and a fruit tart. The soup was thick and delicious, perfect for the cold weather coming through Phoenix lately, and the fruit tart was PHENOMENAL! I'm a sucker for fruit tarts and am always on the lookout for a good one, and this may be one of the best I've ever had. The restaurant itself was clean, the service was quick, and the staff was extremely friendly - we had at least two different people come check and us and make sure we were doing just fine. I had no idea before I arrived, but Kneaders even has an adorable little gift shop with journals, mugs, jewelry, etc.   Overall, a very pleasant lunch! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I keep trying to like these people and they keep disappointing me. Today it was a $9 for a Reuben sandwich with  2 thin slices of shaved corn beef and a dozen stale potato chips. Last week it was a turkey croissant that I asked if it was half a sandwich.   I see granite tables and upscale decor and I expect a generous meal.  Maybe they'll let me know when they fix their menu problems. i won't be back until they do."}
{"text":"We love Kneaders for lunch/dinner and went here this morning for breakfast and it was delicious. My husband got the pecan pancakes and I got the Italian omelette. Their pastries are great as well! Service was very friendly! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped in about quarter to 5 in the afternoon to find the place absolutely mobbed with customers! We checked with a couple on the way out who said that the portions are large and the food delicious. Will make a point to go back at a different time of day when it's not quite so busy and rape them then as the menu looks like the offerings are quite tasty."}
{"text":"I love Kneaders! The food is great and the drive through makes it so convenient for mom's on the go like myself! The breakfast omelettes are my favorite. :)"}
{"text":"We have been here 6+ times at varying times of day. Employees are always personable and the food is delicious!  We especially love the cinnamon rolls, mint brownies and salads. Drive thru service is routinely slow, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is my first time ever eating at Kneaders and I was impressed. I had the Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich which was delicious (but let's be honest, you can't go wrong with anything that has avocado on it). For dessert, I had the Key Lime Tart which is my favorite dessert. I lived in Florida for a long time and got spoiled with having fresh Key limes all the time. Kneaders Key Lime Tart was as good as any that I remember having in Florida and that says a lot. I will be dreaming about this dessert but fortunately, I live right around the corner so I have a feeling this will be my \"go to\" treat when the sweet tooth needs to be satisfied!   Restaurant was clean. Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"1st time here. Emily greater us with a smile promptly and was very helpful. Food was brought out quickly and to our order. Food was fresh and very tasty. We will be back."}
{"text":"Thank you to Tanisha and Amy!...you saved the day with my catering order! Beautiful as always. You all are great!"}
{"text":"I love Kneaders but this particular location needs new management. It's always filthy inside. Dirty tables, dirty drink station, dirty floors, etc. They are also frequently out of \"staple\" items - one time it was kids-size sugar cookies, another visit they were out of focaccia, and at our most recent visit they were promoting a 'slice of pie for $2\" special....but they were out of pie..."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!! I ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado Salad, cup of French Onion Soup and and Kids Meal with the ham sandwich.  First I was given a hard time about putting red onion on my salad and told it was against protocol to add red onion the the kids sandwich.  The said they could add it to the side which I was ok with.  When I arrived home(5 minute drive away) the soup was cold and they forgot to put on half the ingredients to the salad.  There was no feta cheese, cucumber or tomatoes.  I decided to take the salad back which was a hassle.  When I told them what happened I basically got, a \"sorry.\"  After a long pause she reluctently asked if I wanted a new salad which I did.  So I drove back and waited in line for my new salad.  When I got the salad this time it had no croutons on it!  Once I fianally got home to eat the salad it was gross to say the least.  The turkey used on the salad seemed like they got it out of a can and was not fresh at all!!  I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Service was not good - ordered oatmeal with fruit and was never delivered even after I requested it a second time.  Asked for my money back and it was refunded with an \"I'm sorry\".  So am I  - for coming here!"}
{"text":"I had the French dip which was very good. The au jus was plentifully and tasty. I've seen on other posts about the lack of meat, I don't like a foot of meat on my sandwich so I was fine with the amount that was on this one. The bread was great, held up to the dipping. The side salad was fresh, no complaints. The croissant with dark chocolate was great. Flaky crust that was buttery with just the right amount of chocolate was just right. My husband had the club with the collie-flower and cheese soup, he liked both. 50's music was fine. The items for sale are really just a pleasant way to decorate for the season. It is what it is, I was not expecting fine dining, it's a fine place for a quick meal. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Same here.  First time I went and ordered the club, it was awesome. Now last night my club looked like it was just thrown together very sloppily.  Not happy. Probably won't go back. Wasn't that good this time either."}
{"text":"I've only ordered from this location twice, both times online.  The first time went well; I ordered the turkey bacon avocado sandwich on sourdough with no onions.  The order was perfect and ready when I came to pick it up.  The second time was a disappointment.  I ordered the turkey bacon avocado salad with a side of sourdough bread and no onions.  They forgot the BACON.  I was already back at work and had no time to return to the restaurant to resolve the issue; hence, I'm writing this review.  I know I'm not the only one whose orders have come out wrong, and it's not just at this location.  Where's the quality assurance?  And don't ever forget the bacon.  It makes everything better."}
{"text":"Driving thru for a fast easy healthy salad and great service!  I got the avocado turkey (without bacon) and loaded with extra veggies and an iced green tea.  The young lady who took my order was helpful and sweet.  The man who gave me the salad was very friendly!  Great find for a good lunch on the go!"}
{"text":"Awful. Greasy BEC sandwich. Will not ever try again. Still on the hunt for a decent breakfast in Nevada."}
{"text":"Today was our 1st visit here to check it out. Food is pretty good. I would also say our 1st impression when we came through the door was an extremely long wait in line. Granted it was early Saturday which is probably thier busiest. There was only 1 cashier taking orders for a line that went out the door. It was so busy it reminded me of eating at the airport or waiting at the DMV. The employees were working very hard but not at all efficient. They bring the food to your tables by walking through the dining area calling your name. So many people. And why is there wasted space by putting a gift wrapping station in the middle of the restaurant?? The variety and assortment is pretty good as are the prices. Will I come back? Yes. It's a new business and I'm sure the experience will get better over time. I had the cinnamon French toast. It was very good. In case you may not know, they are closed Sundays. Bummer. I will come back and try the sandwiches  during lunch. Give it a try, just don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"I saw the big \"French Toast\" sign outside & decided to check it out. The cinnamon swirl inside was perfect & I LOVE the way the syrup & whip are on the side since I'm. It a fan of whip cream on French Toast. My neighbor tried the ham & egg croissant & it was beautiful!! Fresh croissant & perfectly cooked eggs. This is a great option for causal breakfast with reasonable prices.  Now to take home some extra treats!!"}
{"text":"A Panera-ish type establishment that has a drive thru! They offer sandwiches, soups, salads, and baked goods.   I love the fast, friendly service here and the convenience of a drive thru.    The breads here are excellent. I really like the pumpkin bread, a seasonal offering that is moist and full of pumpkin spice flavor. They have bread samples at the cashier, which is a great opportunity to try different flavors. The jalapeño cheese bread had a nice kick to it!  The sandwiches are filling, yet average. The chicken pesto had a good portion of chicken, but was light on the pesto flavor. The breakfast sandwiches are good too. The  sausage, egg, and cheese on a toasted croissant are definitely better quality than typical fast food chains.   The bakery goods were hit and miss for me. I did not care for the key lime tart or cinnamon bun. The cream cheese brownie was okay, but tasted old.  It's nice that they offer smoothies, but nothing spectacular. The french toast was pretty decent! Nice thick bread and cooked perfectly.   Will return for the bread and to try more sandwiches!  ****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 54/100"}
{"text":"Waited a month to try place so they get the kinks out. The owners are maximizing their profit by hiring KIDS and obviously don't even train them. ?Ordered a simple cappuccino and asked about what size they come in and they had no idea. Then after asking 2 others had to search the register to see that it only comes in one size. So I ordered one. But they never asked if I wanted cinnamon or Caramel on top (which I don't like) so asked for it to be made the way I wanted it and they just stared at each other. I finally asked for refund and left. Kids=low wages=less hours=no benefits so no adult raising a family could ever work her. THIS PLACE SHOULD BE BOYCOTTED!!!!!"}
{"text":"Drive Thru was fast, staff were friendly and the omelette was delicious AND still hot when I got to work 15 minutes later!! Awesome way to start the day!"}
{"text":"Fresh, good quality, tasty sandwiches. Drive thru wait was slightly long but the food made it 100% worth it."}
{"text":"Man, I love seeing people write a short little review and be super petty. Usually things that the restaurant has no control over. #1 goal: DO NOT BE PETTY. That's for myself, anyways. Unless this is a consistant problem.   I've been looking forward to this place since it's right down the street. We don't have a Panera TOO close by, so I was hoping for a nice alternative when I wanted a good sammich. And I was very satisfied.   I had the Famous Club. Everything about it was great. The bread, the meat (they pile it on), the quality of the meat, the veggies...it was great, guys.  My Sugartoosh had a panini and said it was really good too.   I'm really looking forward to their breakfast. I don't eat bread much...but I love, LOVE bread. And this place is off to a great start for me.   Plus: They have a drive up and it took less than 10 minutes to order and be on our merry way.   *thumbs up* guys."}
{"text":"This is a cute little bakery and cafe located in anthem. Inside they showcase some delicious pastries and desserts as well as a little spot for random gifts to put together a little gift basket... it's totally cute and original! The Turkey and Avocado sandwich with hazelnut bread was not only delicious but appreciated!! The hazelnut bread actually had hazelnuts in it, it gave it a little crunch!! Delicious!! And the turkey, it's not your typical deli meat turkey, it's actually real carved turkey!! The whole sand which itself was just amazing and refreshing!! Then I got a large avocado salad and though it was a simple salad with just lettuce, tomato, onion, cucumber, cheese and of course Avocado it just paired great with my sandwich!! This was a refreshing lunch and will be back again, who knows maybe I'll come back and shop their little boutique!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by the low reviews.  I am visiting from out of town and drove by the bakery and decided to stop for lunch.  I thought it was delicious.  A bit on the pricey side for a sandwich combo but definitely delicious.  I had the Chicken artichoke sandwich on ciabatta.  It was so good I figured I would stop for breakfast on the way home Sunday but just saw they are closed...bummer."}
{"text":"AWFUL!!! The ONLY thing worth buying here is bread. Salads....NOPE!!! I paid almost $10 for a salad that was 95% romaine lettuce and 5% crap. The staff also couldn't get the orders correct. NOPE......I'll stick with Wildflower from now on."}
{"text":"I love kneaders and try to go there when I'm in Utah... I was really happy to see one opening in Las Vegas - especially in the Northwest part of town. I took my kids there last night - they had kids meals and I had a turkey sandwich. I love their turkey and of course their bread is delicious. For dessert the red velvet mini Bundt cake is awesome. So happy to finally have something like this on the side of town... I will say that I've been there two times now - both times they messed up my order but fixed their mistakes promptly"}
{"text":"Kitchen can't multitask, waited 20 minutes for a Panini and was very dissatisfied with the Panini. Looks like they threw it in my to-go container. I ordered a Rueben and hardly no pastrami or sour kraut on it! Hardly any sauce. I paid $9.00 for this joke of a sandwhich! Doesn't corporate care what they are producing at this new location. Not good for future business! Had a better Rueben on a cruise ship! True. Was very excited about this cafe opening near my neighborhood but will never return."}
{"text":"Don't go at 8:00 because they will be out of soup by then. Not the first time I've gone and they've ran out of soup. Always slow in their drive thru too. Took my money to cafe zupas :)"}
{"text":"5 stars because they have ridiculously yummy french toast and you can get it through the drive thru! The cinnamon loaf is also top notch!"}
{"text":"Fresh breads and desserts to go were very good. The sandwiches we had were skimpy and very disappointing and with one cashier we had to wait for fifteen minutes to place an order. We heard the buzz and tried it out, I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"This is my first time here I absolutely loved it! Very clean & attentive employees. Food was really good I got a pannini with chips & euclair! Everything tasted fresh & delicious"}
{"text":"I love the food and baked goods here, but the organization could use some help. There should be a separate register for people just ordering bakery items. Currently if you only order bakery items, which are already prepared in the case, you still have to wait behind the people ordering soups, sandwiches, salads, etc. Bakery only customers could be moved in and out much more quickly.  Also, some kind of description of what is in the salads, smoothies, etc would be helpful. Customers shouldn't have to ask about every item when they're trying to order."}
{"text":"Came upon this place while on vacation!  Had an early lunch and it was Fantastic!!!  We had Reuben panini, chicken pesto panini and turkey, bacon avocado on focaccia. All of them were lucious!  The breads are all homemade. We split the sandwiches and ordered 6 pastries for dessert. Everything is made fresh in store - even the potato chips!  Pastries were also wonderful! Came out to about $8 each. GREAT FOOD, Great value and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"First time and enjoyed it. Excellent Italian coffee. Fresh baked bread. Spinach Omelet was very good. Nice service. Restaurant felt new. Very clean. Only inconvenience was pulling out of lot onto Eastern - have to go south and no U turns. I will go back."}
{"text":"Grabbed a sandwich here on way through town, quick friendly drive through service, and a cut above the usual fast food fare.  Lot of options."}
{"text":"First time today and we love it.  Fresh made sandwiches, salads, soups and , oh yeah....bakery items.  Needed something faster, so I ordered online and it worked well.  We had a custom made Cafe Pastrami and a custom made Cafe Turkey, both made our way with the bread and extras we selected.  Made them combos with a soup for one and potato salad for the other.  Good flavors.  My only food suggestion is to have an option online for the ice...heavy, light or none, as I don't use ice.  They were out of Loyalty cards, so I'll have to pick one up next time and have them add these to the account.  They have an excellent selection of breads, baked goods, pastries and more.  They also have gift things, like ceramics, etc.  A little odd for such a place, but if I read right, they come from co-ops, which is a good thing.    We'll be back.  Can't wait."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place. I had a chicken raspberry spinach salad and it was great! There was a good amount of chicken, the raspberry vinaigrette was delicious, and overall I think it was a good amount for the price. And the bread was super yummy! I was impressed."}
{"text":"If Cracker Barrel and panera had a baby, I believe you'd get kneaders. The Decor is very country home and they have various things for sale like signs, breads, jams, and aprons. The dessert case is to die for. Pies, cheesecakes, cannolis, cookies, brownies, anything your fat little heart desires. They have the classic sandwiches, salads and soups to chose from and a pretty good variety at that. They also serve breakfast which i think we may try this weekend. Ordered a turkey bacon and avocado sandwich on country sourdough and my husband had a pastrami sandwich with the chicken noodle soup. (I liked my sandwich better than he liked his, but both still tasty) For dessert we had the apple pie and the salted Caramel cheesecake. They were AMAZING. The only complaint I have would be that service was slow. However, they are new and I'm sure or I hope this improves. Last things to note- They have a drive thru and are closed Sundays."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Kneaders and I'm converted! Super cute inside with delicious pastries (and they build a basket for you!!). The sandwich was exactly what I wanted and came out in minutes. Excited to try their breakfast sandwiches next. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I've let Kneaders fly under the radar so long. I guess I kind of assumed it would be a Panera, but I was so impressed. First off, it's super cute and gives off the local bakery vibe, even selling cute holiday decor next to the adorable fireplace. The bakery items look AMAZING! I didn't try any this trip, but definitely will.   I eat primarily plant based so their Large Green Avocado Salad (sans cheese/ranch, sub balsamic) was a great option for me. It was delish and so was the sourdough bread slice that came with it.    The staff was super friendly and not one thing on my special order was incorrect, which is rare.   I'll be back for sure. Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Smelled good. We waited about 20 minutes for my soup and bread and her breakfast sandwich. The soup was pretty good chicken noodle and authentic noodles were a nice touch. The asiago bread was nothing special and tasted like sourdough without cheese. Her sandwich was good but Burger King makes the same croissant sandwich even better except for the bacon."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money - stick with Paradise/Panera.  First visit here - ordered a chicken salad croissant.  Took the girl forever to figure out how to add a bag of chips to my order.  Got my sandwich - that was 90% sliced waterchestnuts and 10% chicken.  I kid you not.  Wish I had taken a picture.  Too much mayo.  BLAH!  Never again.  Just not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"This is my our favorite new place! I was told by a coworker to give it a try we have been three times in the past two weeks   I have had the chicken salad sandwich on the croissant... which was probably the best person that I've had since I was in Europe.   My son ,the first time, had the pumpkin cheesecake which was phenomenal ...the second time he tried the cinnamon roll which was equally as delicious   We  took home a cinnamon bread (which lasted about two days in our household lol)  The last time we went I had the poblano soup which was delicious creamy, but not heavy or greasy. Everything there is so fresh, you never feel like you've eaten anything processed when you leave there ...it really does have a Bistro- like homemade feel and taste to all their products-- highly highly recommended!!!   both times we went it was not crowded we went on a weekday around 2:45 to 3:30 and it was just great   I love their gifts section I hope they expand it over the holidays really cute and the prices are right their coffee is fantastic, and it's literally not even 10 minutes from my house this place is doing everything right   I'm a fan"}
{"text":"The produce was very fresh and staff was very friendly. I highly recommend this for a quick lunch or light dinner."}
{"text":"We have tried kneaders 4 times now for breakfast and the all you can eat French toast.   Which is AMAZING!!!  But every time we go here my husband always orders another serving of French toast when he finishes his first plate.   Every single time they never bring it out.  The first time we gave them the benefit of the doubt that it got lost in the other orders.   The second and third  time I was like this can't be a coincidence.   We always have to go and say something to them about waiting for it.    Today our 4th visit we waited and  waited and after 15 minutes or so still no french toast.   We finally gave up and left.  Needless to say the all you can eat french toast is not so all you can eat.   FYI the restaurant was not crowded."}
{"text":"First time at Kneaders. Not sure if I will return yet either.   I ordered a loaded potato soup and the Turkey Bacon avocado salad. The menu says it comes with ranch. When I get to the window, I am told they are out of ranch. No problem, I ask for balsamic instead. When the drive thru employee is handing me my salad, I'm informed that they ran out of avocado as well. Then, I get home with the food and am eating the salad, there is no bacon in the salad either.   They need to be more informative about what they are out of before handing the guest their food. And offering to make up for it somehow. It would have been nice to have a different salad if the one I ordered was out of ingredients."}
{"text":"I used to drive all the way to Gilbert to go to Kneaders!  I was thrilled when they built one over here.  Sat in the drive-thru for 25 minutes for a half-salad!!!!  Very frustrated with their customer service.  Don't tell me the delay was because the \"chef\" was cutting fresh lettuce.  My nephew used to work at a Kneaders and he wasn't a chef.  They need to figure it out real quick."}
{"text":"Turkey bacon and avocado on focaccia bread was delicious with tasty tomato lettuce and a slather of mayo. Perfect!"}
{"text":"I tried out this place when I first moved to the area, but I will probably not come back here again. My girlfriend and I both ordered pastries and some iced tea, and everything just tasted awful... the croissant I got was oozing with cream (WAY too much), and as a result was way too sweet. My girlfriends wasn't good either. The iced tea also tasted like it had been in the containers for weeks, or that they had never been cleaned - we had to throw it out after having a couple of sips. The place is also directly next to starbucks, which I don't understand, as they serve some similar items. I was hoping for it to be good, but was honestly pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"I tried this place when I was craving soup. There were only two choices, but I suppose I retrospect it isn't really \"known\" for its soups. I ordered for myself and fiancé: chicken enchilada soup and pastrami. The soup was spicy and warm, the pastrami was mostly bread and lettuce. The prices are expensive for the portions you get. In my opinion, I would rather drive to Zupas for better food and more bang for the buck. I probably won't be going back unless I am craving carbs and lettuce."}
{"text":"I always get the french toast. Everyone is so friendly and the prices on food and bread are reasonable."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and right to the point, food is good. I've always gone here and swapped out bread on sandwiches this time the lady over the drive thru said i couldn't do that.. when I've done it previously. The place takes 25 min. To get me in and out of the drive thru, and the employees are always rude. Customer service is horrible everything is a hassle and there job must be to hard to provide a smile apparently."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service! Waited 25 minutes for a sandwich and salad. This is not a steakhouse..i will not be returning. Food was mediocre. Not worth wasting half your day sitting here."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Chunky Cinnamon French Toast Apple Cinnamon Pecan Bread Pudding Cinnamon Roll German Chocolate Brownie Chocolate Chunk Cookie, Oatmeal Raisin Cookie, Peanut Butter Chocolate Cookie Chocolate Dipped Pecan Tussie Carrot Cake Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Cake  One of two Las Vegas locations for the rapidly expanding chain from Utah, an early morning meeting at Kneaders Bakery & Café showed the restaurant to be something akin to the 'quick-casual' experience offered at places like Panera or Great Harvest Bread Company, the focus a bit more on breakfast and baked goods than the others with otherwise similar ideas and pricing.  Opened in April 2016 and garnering mixed reviews in an evolving area with no lack of options for grabbing an abbreviated meal or something sweet, Kneaders brings the concept of \"European Hearth Breads, made from scratch\" from Gary and Colleen Worthington to the masses with a concise menu featuring Soups, Salads and Sandwiches, a few shortcuts undoubtedly taken in expanding the original iteration but still focused on doing as much as possible in-house each day.  Staffed by a youthful team of smiling faces, table service offered along with grab n' go choices plus Drive-thru, entrance to Kneader's brings patrons face-to-face with several loaves of Bread and other Pastries; Coffee, Tea and Soda service a DIY situation with Smoothies and Blends also offered for those in the mood for such things.  Pairing a small General Store with Gift Baskets to the experience, items currently offered largely Halloween-themed, it was after exchanging $28.35 for a sizable order that seats were taken at a table in the front corner of the space nearest Eastern Avenue, a pair of mistakes in boxed-to-go selections quickly remedied, though had the contents not been perused prior to leaving a rude surprise would have been found several miles away.  Starting off with two Kneaders classics, the Chunky Cinnamon French Toast only offered with Fruit, Cream and 'Caramel-Syrup' despite suggestions on the website of a Banana Cream version, it seems as though the baked slices would benefit greatly from more custard or a quick-sear to impart a little more texture, a far better composition found in Frosting-topped Bread Pudding of which three different flavors are available, the one with Apples and Pecans perfect for Autumn thought the German Chocolate version also looked quite grand.  Completely underwhelming with the doughy Cinnamon Roll, a far better version offered at CRAFTkitchen just up the road, German Chocolate cravings were quashed by a gooey Brownie beneath layers of Coconut and Pecan topping, a trio of Cookies unfortunately seeing 'Chocolate Chunk' lacking in its eponymous ingredient while the Oatmeal Raisin and Reeses-esque Peanut Butter versions were well constructed with a soft center and crisp edges.  Fortunately recognizing the requested Carrot Cake to have been replaced by seasonal Chocolate Chip Pumpkin layers it was with both tasted that Kneaders proved more capable than other similar spots of creating something on par with a restaurant quality dessert, each $3.99 stack offering far more spice than sweetness with good cake to frosting ratio, the \"Tussie\" like a miniature Pecan Pie better on the un-dipped side as the Chocolate came across a bit too sweet and waxy.  Pricy for what it is, though really no different from other similar ideas in today's \"quick casual\" culture, Kneaders offers a slightly different look from Panera to those looking for a soup, salad, sandwich or pastry, though in an area with the likes of CRAFTKitchen and others nearby the simple fact is that residents of Henderson and Las Vegas can support a local business and eat far better for only a few cents extra."}
{"text":"My Kneaders addiction is out of control. I 'knead' their delicious pancakes, french toast, tuna sandwiches, turkey sandwiches, chicken sandwiches, and pastries on the regular. They even have a rewards card where a percentage of what you spend comes back as reward dollars."}
{"text":"Food is good, but they like to make you wait.  My 3rd time here, 3 weeks after open and at 6pm on a Friday night they only have 1 register open. I was in line for 15 minutes, because they Chose to only run 1 register.  Management needs to make better decision. I have purposely passed on a trip because I know I have to wait."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the menu options, atmosphere and staff of kneaders. Your bill certainly can add up quickly with only a couple items. My chai latte was excellent and service was with a patient and with a smile. There's also seasonal knick knacks available for purchase, or just to scope out while your meal or beverage is being made to order."}
{"text":"My portabella panini was basically just cream cheese and bread... Easily the worst panini I've ever had."}
{"text":"My favorite classic sandwich is the turkey. This is fresh off the bone turkey. The portion size is large. It's delicious!  I find it hard to walk past the bakery display case. I've sampled many of the desserts and have never been disappointed.  The chunky cinnamon bread makes the best French toast."}
{"text":"I ordered rolls and a pumpkin pie from their online ordering system. The rolls I received were light and fluffy with a slight crust. However, the pumpkin pie was not as advertised. I received a pie with globs of deflated whipped cream. It was not appealing at all and nothing like what is displayed on their website or even in the display case. It seemed that little care was taken to prepare and present the food. When we cut into the pie the crust was raw and filling was bland. This has to be, by far the worst experience buying prepared food. I will not visit this place again. I am sure, for a lower price, (they charge almost $17 for a pie!) I could get more appealing and delicious food. Do not count on their pies to be a finale to your Thanksgiving feast!"}
{"text":"I like the soups here, but that's about it. The pastries and sandwiches are ok, but really nothing to write home about. Sure, the bread is always fresh, but they're just a bit on the boring side: I can make the same at home.   The people at this location have been consistently friendly, and the soup selection is good. Their tea vats and coffee jugs have always been full when I have needed them. All of that is great and enough to be worth a solid 3 stars, but that doesn't make up for the food being mostly boring.  They have an all-you-can-eat French toast breakfast deal ... good to know if you're into that kind of thing."}
{"text":"Beware! If you buy anything in the retail store, they will not let you return it no matter what.  I bought an apron for my niece, only to remember that I had just bought her one the previous year at Kneaders.  I brought my apron in with the tags still on a couple of days later with my receipt and was told a flat \"no\" when I asked to return the item.  I asked if perhaps I could just get store credit and was told a flat \"no.\"  Kneaders, if you are going to be a retail store, I suggest you have similar policies to every other retail store in the U.S.  I am sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"Whoever said bread is bad for you has never been to kneaders. They have a great selection of daily, fresh delectable baked goods. I often stop by there for a hostess gift, or an inexpensive present. The recipients are always grateful as they know the products are fresh and of good quality. Just writing this review, is making my mouth water!"}
{"text":"This place is basically a Panera but it lacks the hot food that Panera has for lunch. Don't be fooled by the sign that they offer unlimited French toast that only runs until 11 a.m. the pastries are delicious and the sandwiches are good but again they're not hot and they don't offer the same variety the Panera does. Where this place lost its star was not the lack of hot sandwiches but rather the lack of good customer service and being a new business in the area you'd expect them to explain their menu better"}
{"text":"Service was very, very slow today. They might need to hire more employees for the Saturday lunch crowd. Also, just a heads up. If you order a BLT, it does NOT come toasted. They were kind enough to fix it for me, but it took FOREVER. I had to ask someone to check on it. From what I could see, it was sitting on the counter and hadn't been addressed until I asked about it. Other than that, the quality of the food was good."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Great people!!  I love this place.  Dinner rolls and pies are to die for.  Great soups and salads.  I haven't tried any sandwiches yet but I hear others who have that they are very good.    Thank you Kneaders for opening this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I called to find out if the beef dip was toasted or grilled. The wonderful manager said she would definitely grill it for us and suggested adding extra meat for an even better sandwich. I definitely was excited to try our sandwiches and they were AMAAAAZINNG. Thanks to their customer service we will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of out of the way from me but I've heard interesting things and have wanted to give it a try. We've tried going with friends before but the lot was too packed and we couldn't get a spot, except for the unpaved area across the way. But the day we went it was muddy from raining all day. Finally went today for \"dessert\".   The pastries were delicious. Much better than, let's say, Panera. My husband had a Napoleon cake and I tried a peanut butter cookie and a cream cheese brownie. All were delicious.   Besides the small parking lot, I don't like the system they have for getting your order to you. They take your name and just walk around the store calling it out. Feels like a game of Marco Polo. They yell \"Bonnie\" and I yell \"here!\" just so they can find me.   I enjoyed the country decor and they had lots of cute things for sale for the home. I want to come back and try some of the sandwiches and smoothies so I'll try again but, as of now, I'm not overly impressed."}
{"text":"First visit and food was good, staff was so nice. They gave us a free loaf of CHOCOLATE bread for being our first time!!  Soup was delicious!!  Thank you for your kindness today, made my son and I smile!!"}
{"text":"Went today for breakfast - not a very pleasant experience.  Waited a LONG time to place our order - waited a VERY long time for the order to be delivered.  The food (an egg and cheese sandwich) was mediocre at best.  Paradise Bakery is MUCH better in every respect (and it's just down the block).    Won't be back to Kneaders!!"}
{"text":"Just ok.  My french dip was nothing special and my mom's salad was all lettuce.  Kids liked their grilled cheese kids meal with the cookie."}
{"text":"Best Turkey Sandwich I ever had.  I didn't like the parmesian chips though.  tasted like ordinary potato chips and I had desert.  The sandwich was so good that you do not need anything else.  I will come again and just order the sandwich.   the only down part was it was so busy and the chips.  I also did not like that they only had splenda cause I do not like it.."}
{"text":"This place is awefull to say the least!"}
{"text":"Overrated & expensive... I do not  need to leave a long review. I'm more of a straight to the point person."}
{"text":"Kneaders reminds me of a Panera Bread, although they have more pastry options and their ingredients are different. I ordered a turkey croissant sandwich combo #3 which it comes with chips, pastry, and a drink. The food overall was good minus the fact that the amount of chips I got is less than you would get in a regular small bag of chips. So a little disappointed in that, especially with what I was paying for, I expected more.   Overall Kneaders is a nice addition to the Henderson area and much closer to my house than some other food spots, but I suggest giving more to the customers when they are putting out money for this business."}
{"text":"Just discovered a gem in a line of rough eateries. I've had the turkey, bacon avocado sandwich. It's was a fresh and filing sandwich. The meat was so tender and tasty. The veggies included were fresh. A very good sandwich. I also stopped by for breakfast. I had the sourdough pancakes and a side of bacon. Yummy. He pancakes were filling. The syrup was tasty. Nice light caramel flavor. The bacon was the nice thick cut. Really good. I recommend if you haven't tried Kneaders your missing out. It's nice that they have a drive-thru. I'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Overall this place is basic. Sandwiches, Soups and some baked goods. Seems like they also have a fair amount of coffee drinks, however I did not try one of these.   We did try the banana crumb bread, eclairs, and apple pecan bread pudding. The bread pudding was good and I would get again if I return. Both the Eclair and the Banana bread really did not have much flavor. My wife bought the loaf and I honestly did not know what kind of bread it was and at first thought coffee cake. It's sad when the most tasty part is the butter spread.   I can't recommend this place when not too far away is a place called the bagel cafe. They make everything from scratch and offer a greater selection of baked goods among many other items. Also for the same price.. the portions of cake and the eclairs are about 5x the size.. no joke."}
{"text":"I am so excited about this place after I've heard people raving about the Gilbert location.  After eating breakfast here today I am not disappointed. The breakfast sandwich is delicious.  Cinnamon roll my husband had...amazing!!!  They just opened last Friday so they are even giving out samples.  I got to try the bread and a salted Carmel cupcake. Wow! Definitely impressed. The service is also very very good. Everyone is so nice and friendly. They told me that at the end of the day all the leftover breads get donated so it doesn't get thrown away.   They also have a basket wrapping station that I guess you can build your own bread/gift / goodie basket with ribbon for gifts!   This will definitely be replacing wildflower for me.   This is in the Home Depot center next to the AAA building."}
{"text":"I don't come to Kneaders often, but when I do, I always have a great experience. I brought my grandmother and my mom here for lunch the other day and splurged on their cheese melt and chocolate dome dessert. It was so good, and the staff here is very friendly and helpful! I will be coming back for sure and probably end up eating the same thing!"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant! For east Mesa and the normal choices out here this was a great first experience coming to this restaurant. Their bread quality was very fresh, all the other ingredients were top notch as well. I had a turkey club with avocado and it came out perfectly presented. I split a whole sandwich with my husband and they brought out a 2nd plate with the sandwich split in half for us. They bring the food to you. They fresh brew their iced tea. Their pastries are also damn good. I would come here again. As a first experience I'm impressed so far"}
{"text":"First time at this location and we really had a good experience, the people were very friendly and helpful and the food was great. I had the Reuben which was perfect and the desserts were wonderful, we had the carrot cake and also the chocolate croissant was moist and very flavorful. The restaurant was very clean and the atmosphere was very nice."}
{"text":"Not sure I understand the 2 1/2 star reviews. I had a great experience going to Kneaders with a friend. The staff was all smiles, very welcoming and our coffee drinks and pastries were great. It was my first time to a Kneaders, had never heard of them before and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and drinks. Thank you Kera and Matthew!"}
{"text":"They do good with breakfast at least. Don't go there for dinner and order a sandwich on a croissant because the ignorant staff doesn't know what that is. That's what I ordered and I got regular bread instead. I thought this place was a bakery? It seemed like the employees would rather sit around on their phones than work anyway."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I ordered a cafe turkey on their hazelnut bread and the turkey cranberry sunflower salad. Both were delicious. The bread was so soft with hazelnuts baked in. The dressing on the salad was delightful. The man at the counter was friendly and helpful. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Okay, so my husband and I decided to get some soup and sandwiches here for dinner. I called and a recording said on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, they served broccoli, chicken noodle, chicken tortilla, and some other soup; however, when we arrived, only two soups were available,  but they weren't even ones listed on their recording!  I ordered the turkey, bacon, avocado on Focaccia and he ordered a Reuben.  I got a small cup of Asiago soup and my husband got a small cup of potato salad.  $26 was our bill, which is ridiculously overpriced for what we got.  Then, after we ordered and sat down to wait for our order, my husband was informed they were out of pastrami, so he had to choose a different sandwich after we'd already paid!  Get a clue, Kneaders!  The bread on both sandwiches was delicious. The Asiago soup was also delicious, and I wanted more--their cups were incredibly small.  My husband's potato salad was just mediocre.  I don't think we'll go back; too expensive for just mediocre food."}
{"text":"Went there twice this week and they only had one soup and were out of cinnamon buns this morning at 11. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed with  this place!! Waited in the drive thru for 15 minutes and only 2 cars ahead of me..ordered a grilled sandwhich and they gave it to me cold...CLEARLY not grilled. Not impressed that i had to get out of my car and go inside after all this and then there was nobody at the register to help me..waited at least a full minute before anyone even noticed me standing right there and  took them an unbelievable amount of time to grill the sandwhich..never did get the pickle spear which really upset me because they charged me for it..these people need to get their act together.."}
{"text":"I come here all the time always order the same thing, raspberry nut salad chips and a smoothie. They always charge differently. One day the cashier will charge for a combo and add 2.29 for the smoothie and then the next day the charge full price for everything which is fine just keep it consistent. Also one day I ordered the salad no chicken no onions and they gave me no raspberries. The next time I ordered it with no nuts and they still gave me the nuts. So I'm not getting what I order, I'm getting stuff I don't want on it or stuff I do want on it not on it. The quality of the food is always good, but the consistency of the cashiers is always off."}
{"text":"Listen. If this place wasn't where it was, I'd have probably gone insane. Back in school I had a Java Hut to escape to in order to make my days more bearable.A year later, I have Kneaders close to work.   I work at a preschool literally 1 minute away, located in the same plaza and I can't tell you how many times I've escaped to this place for lunch. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.   Their employees are all amazing and kind. Fast, reliable and respectful service. Remembers their frequent customers and treats them well.  My go to: Rueben on rustic rye panini with a cup of broccoli chowder.   Trust kneaders to make me feel better. Even on an incredibly shitty day."}
{"text":"Delicious breads,  pastries and soups. Call order ahead and use drive through on the way home. Very nice staff."}
{"text":"Kneaders Bakery is tasty and has a fun atmosphere. Plus, they have a drive thru.  I had a half turkey sandwich on hazelnut bread with a side of broccoli salad. Plus, I had a bowl of white cheddar & poblano soup with slice of baguette bread.  Also, I had a pomegranate berry tea. The bread at kneaders is fantastic. I especially like the white cheddar & poblano soup because I like the taste of poblano chilies.  The turkey used on the sandwich is nice because it is not deli meat.  They make the sandwich with a cut of turkey meat. Plus, the tea is brewed fresh. They are not using the chemical tea dispenser here.  They have a couple other great iced tea selections as well as some hot tea choices.  I like broccoli salad but the one they make has too much dressing for my liking."}
{"text":"The food is good, but that's where it all ends. There is always a line out the door and only one register open. Staff is semi friendly, always the same excuse that they are understaffed. Nobody seems to care when I bring up the line and waiting time... very substandard."}
{"text":"When daddy is at home we really enjoy our lunch time at kneaders Bakery and cafe, nice people, excellent service and delicious food. Did you know they have breakfast ?? You can choose between:  chunky cinnamon French toast homemade sourdough pancakes  pecan pancakes  Greek omelette  Italian omelette  American omelette  American omelette Mexican omelette  tell us which one do you want to try"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at my experience eating lunch here recently. The staff was super friendly and patient as we had difficulty deciding on so many choices. The gluten free options were clearly noted too. I had a gluten free broccoli soup and a turkey salad. The turkey was so fresh as were all the other ingredients. Since the breads were not GF, I asked to take home my side bread and it was nicely wrapped for my hubby at home. I was with three other ladies and each of us was satisfied and would go back."}
{"text":"On par with Cocos or Panera.   Some of the reviews of this place are hilarious.   This isn't a Michelin star rated place, guys.   Let's not take ourselves too seriously.  A good alternative to fast food.   Bread is great.  I normally just hit the drive through or pickup our order.  Everyone is always pleasant.  If you want something that is waiting under a heat lamp until you order it, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Wow such a cute place, the staff was very nice, the food was so good, can't wait to go back! So much I wanna try! Breakfast served till 11am their croissants are prefect so fluffy!"}
{"text":"The moment Kneaders came to Las Vegas I was lucky enough to get the chance to try out all the delicious breakfast pastries, cookies and especially there AYCE French toast. I highly recommend trying the orange rolls when they are season. Absolutely dericious!"}
{"text":"I had a good experience at Kneaders.  Went for lunch with my co-worker friend.  It was busy and loud, but I was happy with the salad.  I ordered the Chicken ala Mondo without bacon.  It was fresh and delicious.  I preferred it over what I've had at Salad and Go.  For dessert I tried a sugar cookie and a brownie.  I preferred the cookie.  The brownie had an strange texture.  I like dense moist and chewy, and this was kinda sandy.  They had a good selection of desserts.  I like that they have a drive through.  It's a good place for a work lunch or just to grab a quick bite and head back for work."}
{"text":"I'm over this place. They're over priced, customer service isn't good seeing that the cashiers seem to completely hate their lives and everyone that orders from here and they always make me feel like an idiot when I order. If the pancakes weren't so good I would stop coming here"}
{"text":"You have to love this place!  If not for its huge menu selection, then for its ambience.   I love their salads and sandwiches - particularly the turkey, avocado on focaccia. Half a sandwich and cup of soup is a great way to wind down after a hectic day in the city, or a great way to start your lunch.   I've never tried their breakfast items due to all the other menu items.   Go to Kneader's the next time you're craving a cool sandwich or hot bowl of soup. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Great customer service and I love the sweets this place has. The key lime tart is wonderful also enjoy the French dip . The French dip is huge it can be shared"}
{"text":"Horrible service, told the server our food order wasn't correct and she was upset an threw my child kids meal down towards him. Told the manager and she was behind him rolling her eyes and said yeah right whatever and walked off!! Will NEVER eat st that kneaders again. If you want excellent service go to Mesa on signal butte or queen creek one!!"}
{"text":"Good food. The oatmeal was great and egg and cheese croissants were good too. Will come back for more."}
{"text":"This place is packed mainly because it just opened.  Stood in line for 10 minutes but that gave me a chance to check out all the goodies.  There are no prices and no labels of what the products are... I guess if it looks good, who cares how much it is or what it is, right?!  LOL.    I ended up ordering a regular croissant, a chocolate croissant, and an Almond croissant.  Hands down -- the Almond croissant was the best.  Apparently, they have a Loyalty card -- but for some reason, the gal did NOT offer it to me, but I heard her telling the customer about the rewards program after me while I was waiting for my croissants.  Hmmmmm..... do I NOT look like I could be a loyal customer?  lol.  Anyway -- it's so loud in there so make sure you pay attention to your name being called or else you'll be standing there for a long time.    I'll be back... with or without a rewards card.  HA!"}
{"text":"stops breakfast at 11, I have to type more to publish this. wonder how many more words are needed"}
{"text":"Decided I'd try Kneaders this afternoon. There was only one person in front of me and about8 people in the dining area. I ordered the turkey, avocado, bacon salad. I ordered it to dine in. When I went to sit down, I found the table I'd chosen was dirty. Looking around, I realized the majority of all the empty tables were dirty and there was food all over the floor. A nice girl brought out the food which was wring...it was a sandwich rather than a salad. I told her what I ordered and asked her to make it to go because it was too cold. It was cold, but I was leaving because I didn't want to eat in a filthy restaurant. When I got home, I found that there were about 4 pieces of bacon the size of a dime in my salad. The turkey and avocado appeared fresh. Boy sure if this whole thing is the norm...it's unfortunate they don't place emphasis on cleanliness. Will not return. I gave two stars instead of one because the gal that brought the food out was friendly."}
{"text":"I really love how friendly the staff is at this location and how quickly they serve food to their customers ! This spot is great if you are in a rush cuz they are fast and have a drive- thru.   I tried their Breakfast Combo and ordered a Sausage, Egg, amd Cheese Croissant with a side of Steele Cut Oatmeal topped with sliced Banana and chopped walnuts. It also came with a drink and I thought  Fresh Squeeze Orange Juice - YUM!   It's 's a great way to start your day with a delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"Ordered a simple French dip sandwich and salad and it took over 30 minutes to get it to our table. Literally 4 other people in the restaurant so it wasn't busy. It seems all of us were slow in getting our food. My sandwich was cold, cheese was hard and stale and bread was rock hard and su jus was lukewarm. When I took it back to counter to complain I had to wait 5 minutes til someone even noticed I was there. When I finally told them I was upset there was no warm sincere apology just an \"ok\" do you want your money back?   Have been here three times before since it opened not long ago and it had been pretty good. Tonight it was a terrible experience. Not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"To start off, it took 30 minutes to get me my sandwich. I ordered the chicken pesto on sourdough. After giving my full order, and telling her I was finished, she read my order back to me. I then told her it was correct and right before paying, she said they were out of sourdough. Now I know what you're thinking \"well why didn't she tell you that when you asked for sourdough?\" And my answer to that is I have no clue. After finding out they didn't have the bread I requested, she read off the other options, I decided to go with ciabatta since all the others sounded absolutely disgusting. After ordering I sat down where there was only 1 party ahead of me, and a party of 2 behind me. I then waited 30 minutes to get my sandwich, which was made wrong. The bread was stale, they added mayo, and the my put 3 pieces of chicken on it which were the size of a McNugget. All in all, never again will I be dining at this establishment."}
{"text":"Tonight was our second try at this kneaders. Lots of people working there so I would think the manager or someone would take the time to wash the windows. It would make first the impression more impressive and guest would think the kitchen is kept up to par. Aside from that, the soup's tasted good but should be hotter.  We hope the manager takes notice of the comments being made and brings this restaurant up to standards."}
{"text":"The chicken salad sandwich was pretty good but jeez, for what they give you and the price you pay...I would honestly rather have a ham sandwich at home. My sandwich didn't come with chips...fruit....salad...or even a drink and it was (with tax) $10...and I was still hungry after I ate it. I prefer to eat at Wildflower Bread Co. or Panera where the price seems to be more fitting for the type and portion of food you are getting."}
{"text":"I love that this place has a drive thru! Since it's colder out I have been coming here regularly to get soup. A bowl of soup and bread is under five bucks and is never disappointing! Give this place your business, they deserve it!"}
{"text":"What do you expect when you order \"French Onion Soup\"? Right: a nice rich broth, well, maybe it won't have wine, but still, good broth, caramelized onions, some gruyere cheese, some bread, and if not bread then at least some croutons on top?  Here is the recipe from Kneaders: boil water, add spoon of beef stock powder, add a bit of chopped up onion, boil the heck out of it. Let it cool down till it's almost cold, serve to your customer who them pays $4.59. Management laughs its way to the bank. Never again!! We will never back. We have tried Kneaders three times and each time was worse then the time before. What's happening with this company???"}
{"text":"Super nice staff, great prices, very clean and I love the gift shop inside! I got the Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich and it was awesome! I also had their green tea. Super good. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"No wifi here which is a big disappointment. I only get salads here and I'm never too impressed - I think food is overpriced. Unfortunately this won't be a local spot for me :( I need wifi. What kind of lunch / coffee spot doesn't have wifi for remote workers who want to work thru lunch?"}
{"text":"This place is good! I had the turkey  cranberry croissant.  It could have had more cranberry, which would have made it excellent, but whatever.  It was fresh and quick and a fair price."}
{"text":"Although I think the sandwiches and salads are pretty good, the bread is what really makes this place good. I always buy a couple of loaves every time I take my office staff here for lunch. I once had a bad experience with the panini's, but to be fair, the management was very apologetic about it and made it up to us on a future visit. If you like cheesecake, their cheesecake is absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"The location of this store is not convenient to me as it is hard to get in and out of.  Also, they have a fairly small parking lot.  As another reviewer notes, upon entering Kneaders it feels like Panera Bread mixed with Cracker Barrel.  One thing they should change immediately is the system they have for getting your dining room order to you. They take your name when you order and then to deliver your order just walk around the store calling out your name. If I return I will use an alias since I don't want the whole dining room to know my name.  I mean if I wanted to introduce myself to everybody in the dining room; I would just stand up and do so.    It was our first visit to this location today and we ordered a chocolate croissant, latte and smoothie.  The cashier did not know what was in any of the smoothies and had to call a co-worker over to explain the ingredients.  If you don't know the menu you shouldn't be on a register.  The croissant and blueberry #5 smoothie were good.   However, I found the Lavazza latte to be quite strong and cup wasn't full so I think it just needed more milk.  Also, they could save some money on to go orders by not using heavy clear plastic to go containers and a plastic bag for one croissant  Lastly, this seems to be a breakfast/lunch establishment so the hours of 7am-10pm don't make sense to me.  Why not open at 6am and close somewhere between 6pm and 8pm?    Overall, a meh experience so nothing driving us to return next week."}
{"text":"Kneaders... it's like Panera with a smaller menu, but with way better options for desserts/sweets.    I normally opt for the Chicken Salad served on a croissant... but most recently I ordered the Chicken, Cheese, Ham sandwich.  And that sandwich!  OMG... the CCH sandwich comes on a ciabatta roll and includes grilled chicken breast, ham, mayonnaise, honey mustard, Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, salt, and pepper.  It's my new happy sandwich.  If you're in a bad mood, then order this sandwich and you will feel better.  If you're having a bad day, then order this sandwich and your day will be better.  If your wife just left you for the postman and your dog ran away, then order this sandwich and hopefully your dog will come back and your wife won't!  For dessert, order the eclair.  It is DIVINE!  I wish I could eat one of these every day.  For every meal.  I wish there was an alcoholic beverage version of this.  So good!  I am a fan!  If I got kneed on the way to Kneaders, then I would still need Kneaders!  ****FOUR STARS****"}
{"text":"I am always looking for drive thru places that have fresh and good-for-you food.  Today I tried Kneaders on San Tan Village Parkway and it did NOT disappoint!  The service was quick, the cashier was friendly, and the Southwest BBQ Chicken Salad I chose was delicious.  Fresh ingredients, nice sized portion and excellent Cotijo Cilantro dressing.   I will be back.  :)"}
{"text":"Great baked goods. I love that their turkey isn't lunchmeat, but roast turkey. I'm not thrilled with their drink selection...worst iced tea I've had. But food is usually good. Lately,  they've been hit and miss with getting the order exactly right...both times, the same girl was taking our order.  I like their salads. Hubby likes their sandwiches ...and soups. We have never been here for breakfast...very limited breakfast menu.  They have great gift baskets and a small gift section. Closed on Sunday. They have outside seating and plenty of parking. Very convenient to the 202 freeway onramp."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is a dream come true. Good hours, good food, great service and selection and gift wrapping as an extra bonus. We had a delightful lunch of chicken salad and pastries. They have salads, sandwiches, pastries, pies, cookies, brownies and much more. I need to revisit to try other selections. Yum!"}
{"text":"If you are going to charge so much for a sandwich, at least put fresh lettuce and avocado on it. Overpriced!"}
{"text":"After posting my scathing review, I posted a complaint on Kneaders' corporate website. This was weeks ago. No response of any kind. Another Utah based restaurant chain (Zuppa's is another) showing a complete disregard for customer satisfaction. Shame!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Went for the first time yesterday and had a turkey sandwich and brought some cinnamon rolls home.  Phenomenal!!  Great food and cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I will definitely go through the drive thru next time. The entire time I Sat  in the dining room no one came out and cleaned the tables as people left. I had to sit at a table that hadn't been wiped down. There were 3 or 4 staff members but they all stayed behind the counter and it was not busy. Also, constant beeping! I work in a restaurant, I know what a timer sounds like. I'm pretty sure it means you're supposed to check on something or take it out of the oven not just let it beep forever and ignore it."}
{"text":"i am so so so so pissed i could cry. first of all let me start by saying i love this kneaders. this location has always been consistent and i've never had an issue with anything i get. so after an extremely long and hard day i make the drive to this location (15-20 mins) and get there at 8:30 on the 31st. sign on the door says closing early due to halloween.  ok so i barely make it. put in my order ($35) and wait (observing the staff literally scrambling around trying to get everything done to get out of there)   i ordered:  - the large green avocado salad extra cucumbers, avocado on the side and extra thousand island dressing with croutons.  - large turkey bacon avocado salad with caesar dressing and croutons  - club sandwich on asiago bread  i receive my food and leave. as i put the food in the car one of the salads fall out. i look at it and notice the dressing is white. looked closer and no extra cucumbers.  looked at the other salad to make sure it was ok.  looked fine. i took the green avo salad back and as i was walking in the i overheard the cashier say \"omg i gotta lock the door\" it's 8:52   i showed her the salad and said wrong dressing, no extra cucumbers and no extra sauce. she promptly took it to the back and had them fix it.   no problem, it happens and i head home.   i get home and unpackage everything and here's where it goes down hill for me:  1. the green avo salad had literally 2 pieces of avocado the size of my pinky in the salad. seriously?!? and it wasn't on the side like i requested.  2. then i notice i didn't get any croutons. NONE. ON EITHER SALAD. really?!?!? the very highlight of my salad was missing.  3. proceed to dip my lettuce and turkey in the dressing and that's when i blew it. they gave me ranch instead of the requested caesar dressing. I F*#*^%NG HATE RANCH DRESSING.  4. club sandwich was not made with the requested asiago bread. jeeeezzzzzz   it is now 9:30pm, i have no dinner and no way to call them and complain. if they weren't in so much of a damn rush to get out early none of these mistakes would have been made. $35 down the drain   i own a sandwich shop in town and i completely understand the desire to leave early whenever management allows. what i don't understand and will never tolerate is the complete lack of attention and care given to a customer and their food order. unacceptable at my shop and unacceptable anywhere else.   if management is reading this, please reiterate to your staff the importance of getting customers order right. i don't care if someone comes in within the last five minutes of the day, you get their order right."}
{"text":"Took the kids to grab a late breakfast, I didn't event know they had breakfast until recently, and it is top notch! I got the Mexican omelette and it was delicious, I totally recommend it. Service was quick and friendly, restaurant was clean and the baked goods are AMAZING. I'll be visiting again for sure!"}
{"text":"I love Kneaders. The food is AMAZING! The desserts are AMAZING! It can get busy so if you are going during a rush hour, please allot yourself some time. Inside is bright and open. It's seat yourself but you can go inside or outside.   The signal butte location is closest to my house but unfortunately it's not my favorite. Every time I have gone to this location my order is usually messed up and nobody cares. Things like forgetting dressing on my salad and getting irritated when I ask for salad dressing, or changing the bread without asking and saying they are out of the one you want; after specifically telling you they have it when you order and pay, and then expecting you to like the bread they chose for you in lieu of other options. I typically don't have this problem for other locations and easily rate other locations 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times and only used the drive through. The drive through is slow even when your ordering just pastries where it doesn't take much to put together. I've been there when the drive through was light and they still took too long to provide the orders. I also didn't like any of the pastries. Like I've ordered their bread pudding n it was dry n hard, not soft n warm like most bread puddings. Their salty caramel cheesecake was just okay nothing to write home about. Their fruit tart was also just okay. I also have ordered the sandwich roast beef w dip and it was a bit salty. The only thing that was good was the French toast which was also a bit dry, but I have had better from monami gabi. So to sum up I have given this place enough chances, I don't think I will be going back here for a while."}
{"text":"stopped here for breakfast on my way to work and it was perfect. there wasn't a long wait in the drive thru, the staff was very competent and helpful and my order was correct.   i ordered a bacon & cheese on croissant and the croissant is so soft and buttery! the coffee is good as well.   i will be back and think it's a great place for good quality breakfast on the run."}
{"text":"Have been to Kneaders 3 or 4 times now. Here is the deal with this place.....Go for the bread loaves...especially the Jalapeno Cheddar loaf. 5 bucks for that one and a better buy then Great Harvest bakery. The pastries are all overpriced. I bought a Blueberry Walnut White Chocolate muffin. They sell just the Muffin Top for 3 dollars ? Where is the rest of the muffin ? For 3 dollars you should get the whole thing ! I have had breakfast a couple times and lunch a couple times. All of the Breakfast or Lunch choices are all very overpriced and underportioned. This last trip one day ago , I got the French Dip on baugette and my brother got the Reuben. Both sandwiches were about 8 dollars , sides and drinks were extra. Each sandwich had one or two slices of meat. Everything is portion controlled , and the sandwiches taste great , but have very little fillers. Capriottis for the same price is a way better deal. Overall , the quality of the food is great ; but expect to walk away with a lighter wallet !! Go here for the bread loves though...the BEST !!"}
{"text":"Not much of a breakfast menu and mediocre breakfast food at best."}
{"text":"What an incredible and delightful bakery! I will be back over and over again the apple pie that I had was delicious, and the cinnamon roll reminded me of cinnamon rolls my mother used to make as a child. On point!  The pumpkin bread flavor and spice combinations were out of this world."}
{"text":"First time here very home like atmosphere, the food was good we actually came for breakfast. Prices are good & food quality is excellent. Place is very clean. No WiFi but who cares enjoy a meal and talk about your day.....will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"I would totally give this place five stars if it wouldn't be for the very rude cashier. She is a lady much older than everyone else there. I can tell she's been there a long time. She seemed extremely irritated by the few questions I had for her. I told her it was my first time there. She didn't even tell me about the samples of bread that was there. I asked her about it, but she pretended not to hear me.  Other than that, I had a wonderful experience. The food was simple yet delicious. I had a half of a turkey sandwich which was very filling, butternut squash soup which was warm but not hot, flavorful but not salty! And, for dessert, I chose the much talked about fruit tart which is all it's hyped up to be! I also love the decorations and all the cute aprons that all the servers were wearing!   I will definitely come to this place again and again. And, each time, I will try a different sandwich and soup and definitely a different dessert! They have so many to choose from!"}
{"text":"It's a great bakery! Very cute ambience.. Their desserts are really fresh and delicious. Try the chocolate mousse cake and you won't be disappointed  ---// sigh they have shut their business here :("}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Food was delicious, staff was friendly, and their raspberry pastries were amazing. Love this place so far. Will be back for certain."}
{"text":"This place feels like a small town Bakery and cafe. The employees are always so welcoming and quick to help you with your menu choices. I was originally introduced to them when someone gave me one of the double fudge brownies to try...I was completely hooked after that! They are heaven! I now go whenever I get a chance to head up to Anthem, yep, just for the brownies. You can buy 5 and get one free. You can try the other flavors of course, they are all good, but please do not pass up the double fudge...to die for! We have also taken the time to dine in for their breakfast. You order at the register and they bring the food to your table when ready. Pancakes were good but the syrup is probably an acquired taste. Our egg sandwiches were good. I have yet to try lunch menu items, but they definitely look appetizing. They also offer a drive though for those who like a drive by!"}
{"text":"Worst kneaders we've ever been to. Tonight will probably be the last night we ever go to this location and make a longer drive to another one just to avoid them. They consistently skimp on the meat. If I'm paying more than $8 for a sandwich, I would hope it would be more than just the bread. The waits are always longer than what we are used to and the customer service is NEXT TO ZERO. Also, EVERY time we have gone, they are always out of something. We were very excited when we heard they were opening one up in this area since we are originally from Utah and that's were this franchise started but every interaction with this location has been negative. I recommend going to the other locations to get the REAL kneaders experience."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed. I ordered the turkey bacon avocado sandwich, for the price I would expect there to be way more turkey, there was only a sliver of meat. It was so disappointing! I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We've never had anything but good food and service at Kneader's, but they just don't blow me away.  It's a busy place, and they are not open on Sundays. I love the drive-thru and their prices are pretty good. I've had a selection of items here: omelets, breakfast sandwiches, pancakes, etc. Everything is tasty and fresh.   Overall, I would rather go to Dunkin's down the road, but then again, I haven't had any of the lunch items. It's pretty convenient for us, so I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really don't want to be negative but I use to love Kneader's. Their prices went up and the customer service and efficiency has lacked over the year. If the prices increase well so should the service and quality. I spent 15 mins waiting for my food behind one car and an almost empty dining room inside. When I got to the drive thru window the staff worker told me how much the food was and I was baffled. He responded \"yeah they increased the prices\". I didn't know how much the panini was because it wasn't listed on the drive thru menu. I could have gone to a non-drive thru restaurant and would of had paid similar prices or cheaper with customer service. Basically, it would of costed around 30 dollars for 2 people for two sandwich combos!! I was speechless at first and I said I really do not wanna pay for that especially having waited for 15 mins almost 20 mins at this point. He didn't know how to handle the situation and there was no supervisor around. He just said well we already made the food with no apology for the wait. We just left after saying we are not going to pay for this experience. I have no reason to come back to pay 15 dollars for a sandwich combo for a 20 min wait."}
{"text":"We are definitely breakfast people but always in a rush. Kneaders is totally a staircase up from our regular DD. It was delicious! Better quality breakfast. Fancy treats. And the coffee was good too. We got a Kneaders card and will be using it again soon!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area so we thought we would give it a try.  Fresh is the first thing to come out of my mouth.  We waited a bit but it's not MacDonald's.  We've since purchased the cinnamon bread loaf - wonderful and the German brownies are super delicious.  There's such a huge selection of desserts and bakery items, It will take us awhile to go through it all.  Bottom line it's worth trying:)."}
{"text":"This place is a better Panera.   Food: almond croissant and breakfast croissant with sausage and egg and coffee. The almond croissant was a bit different in that it had an almond flavored custard on top. A bit sweet, but fresh. Hubby REALLY liked his breakfast. I guess compared to McDonalds it's an upgrade. Quality better than Panera.   Ambiance: I liked the nice, clean seating area with comfortable booths and quartz counters. Nice to sit here and relax a bit and not feel rushed.   Service: friendly, although they should have more than one cashier going... Food was brought to our table in an expected amount of time.   Location: convenient to me, but like others said hard to turn around and go back towards 7 hills. Basically make a right on the first street, otherwise you enter Anthem and can't make a u-turn anywhere!  Will try the carrot cake next time."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.. Very cute restaurant, nice set-up, order your food and they bring it to your table ... Friendly service and nice selection of soups, salads and sandwiches ... I ordered the turkey, bacon avocado sandwich on focaccia bread .. The menu said fresh pulled turkey but this was definitely canned turkey.. After 2 bites I pulled the canned meat off and just ate it without.. My friend got the same but in a salad form and immediately said the same.. Would try this restaurant again but not order anything with canned meat.."}
{"text":"So glad we gave this place a try! The food was food was really good! We will definitely be back....and with the family. Price was great. Can't wait to try all those delicious desserts!"}
{"text":"Stale.   So bummed about this location  - purchased 2 turkey cranberry croissant sandwiches tonight with their homemade parm chips.  Both croissants and chips were Stale.  The bread was hard and the chips were soggy.  Not impressed at all - Should have went to subway across the street."}
{"text":"When I walked in here at 10:00 a.m. today, I was hoping to see an assortment of scrumptious bread products (perhaps of the breakfast variety, given the time of day) and attentive friendly staff. Instead, the first things I encountered were a closed register to my right, a tower of products for sale to my left, and a short line of patrons ahead of me.   I scanned the menu overhead. Nothing offered for breakfast jumped out at me as particularly exciting. There were several staff members behind the counter, some bustling about, others not so much. For the four minutes I stood in that unmoving line, not once did any member of the horde of visible employees greet me, smile at me, or even freaking look at me. This made me unhappy -- hey, Kneaders, let me know you appreciate my business!   As I continued to stand there like the ghost I apparently was, things started to agitate me, like the location of the merchandise mountain blocking the dining area from view and the fact that the bread behind the counter was haphazardly thrown onto wooden shelves (I assume this was the look they were going for, though). I noticed a display case filled with dessert-type items. It was still breakfast time according to their posted menu (\"till 11 a.m.\"). Why weren't breakfast items showcased? Maybe hip Arizonans eat frosted brownies for breakfast and I'm out of touch.  I wish I could comment on the taste of the food, the speed & accuracy of service, portion sizes and what not. Unfortunately, I departed after those four uneventful minutes. This first impression of Kneaders is a crappy one and I don't plan on giving a second chance any time soon. Great job rubbing a bread lover the wrong way!"}
{"text":"Fresh bread, gr8 soup, yummy smoothies, crisp salads and wide breakfast and liunch selections.  Drive in is a good idea but it could be smoother.  Can be congested when crowded and they have to shout out your name.  Like the combination specials.  Like the club sandwich and the paninis.  Coffee is good."}
{"text":"It's OK if you like bread, I guess, which was the overwhelming majority of my sandwich (see picture). I pulled the top half off and ate the sandwich open-face style. The chips were good, but very sparse. It's fast food chain quality food - nothing special."}
{"text":"I ordered a half pastrami sandwich. It was a leaf of lettuce, 2 thin slices of pastrami, 2 slices of tomato, a slice of cheese, and mayo. That's it. It sucked. My wife had a salad and she liked so it gets 2 stars."}
{"text":"Sarah has been amazing. In December, I ordered a bunch of cookies for my students and they looked and tasted amazing. Then I called a day later and ordered 9 breads to be wrapped for Christmas presents again she smiled and said we can do that.  I drive for Lyft on the weekends and she made sure I had fresh coffee for NYE night. Again and again when I come in she always make sure that my order is correct and goes above and beyond to make all her customers happy. She is the reason I keep coming back to this location. Thank you Sarah for making every experience a great one. Now it's hard to go in when she isn't here at night we miss her."}
{"text":"As much as I enjoy the food and yummy goodies here, the wait is horrendous!  I ordered a hot sandwich and iced latte at 8:32 and I'm still waiting!  It's now 8:54. Not sure if I'll be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Fresh baked goods. Salads, sandwiches, fresh soups and home decor shopping!? What more could u ask for?  Friendly staff and clean establishment."}
{"text":"Got my food quickly and it was really good. Employees were nice too! So many treats to choose from."}
{"text":"Tbh this place has some bomb food. I was impressed by the freshness of the deserts and bread. I haven't enjoyed fresh baked bread in awhile, it was a pleasant experience. Their smoothies are smooth and refreshing. And their water is very nice. You know sometimes you go to a restaurant and the water is wack, now worries this place got nice water."}
{"text":"Thank you For a drive through! I'd like you guys better if you came with a side salad. Good fresh sandwich! I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"Argumentative, underportioned, overpriced franchise with a defensive owner uninterested in your issues with his poor food quality, preparation and undertrained staff as of Thursday, February 2nd 8pm for carryout."}
{"text":"Great little place! The community needed another place like this. Homey atmosphere, solid American bistro menu items, the desserts were amazing as well. Only comments would be that the \"line\" is a dense funnel that makes it a little packed with only two parties in line; and the team member at the register was ready for us to order however stood there blankly staring without acknowledging us to indicate that she was ready to receive our order. Not really anything big to gripe about but definitely the team needs some room to grow. Food was great, though!"}
{"text":"Always love Kneaders!! I also love that it has a drive thru! I ordered the turkey bacon avocado sandwich and it did not disappoint! So good and fresh. And don't forget their delicious double fudge brownie for dessert."}
{"text":"$5.60 for unlimited, delicious and amazing French toast, I am a fan. Service was quick, coffee was hot, and all of their baked breads and desserts looked amazing as well. Quick, easy, cheap breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This place was yummy !Its pretty much Panera bread with a different name..I had a French dip the bread was super soft with a crunchy outside ."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food is always fresh, friendly service. The French toast is delicious and I dare anyone to try to finish more than 2 pieces. The manager, Johnathan is very personable, good resource for local things to do recommendations. Cute decor and the bathrooms are very clean"}
{"text":"Food is delish.... just takes 100 years to get it. Worth it if you have the time to wait.    5 stars for taste   1 star for customer service/timeliness"}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches, soups and chocolate domes.  All the pastries are delicious.  And the French toast for breakfast is SO good."}
{"text":"I only give it a 3 star because the service is always really slow , the fact that you pay almost $9 for a sandwich and then have to pay another $4 to make it a meal . On the upside the food is usually pretty good , and the decorations are very welcoming ."}
{"text":"Drive thru is painfully slow - 25 minutes with 3 cars all for a coffee. The vanilla latte was terrible.  On top of all that the girl at the drive thru was rude ' if your going to have slow service and terrible coffee at least have outstanding customer service.  Will never return."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in to pick up some food on my way home from work. This place gave off Panera bread vibes and I decided to try the turkey bacon avocado sandwhich with a small chicken noodle soup and a fruit tart. The sandwhich was good the noodle soup was disappointing and tasted like canned store bought overpriced soup. I am usually a big fan of fruit tarts and was disappointed as well. Save yourself a trip and go to Panera bread instead. The quality is better and they have a bigger selection."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I find something new to love.  Their sandwiches are made with fresh ingredients and the fresh-baked bread is amazing.  My mom and so appreciate that their turkey sandwiches have real turkey and not that preformed junk.  I haven't had the heart to try any of their desserts yet because they are so decadent and they look delicious. Someday..."}
{"text":"This is the Kneaders closest to my house, however my favorite location is the one in Mesa. My least favorite is the one in Scottsdale with the worst service. I love Kneaders. I love browsing their decor (even though it's over priced) and I love their bakery. I have liked all their soups and most of their sandwiches. Pretty much all of their food has been very good. But most of their time their service had been very slow. I usually don't go there unless I don't have somewhere to go after and I can just take my time. If I am in a rush, there is no way I'm driving thru Kneaders or eating there. They aren't quick or very attentive. Plus it's a little overpriced. But for tasty bakery foods, soups and salads. This is your place."}
{"text":"Went back a second time for lunch, definitely did the drive thru again, a lot faster than the first day, but the food was meh the second time. I ordered the same sandwich I did the first day which was the turkey bacon avocado on focaccia....it was good the first couple bites, but whoever made it this time out so much salt, I couldn't finish it. The citrus coconut scone was still amazing. My girlfriend ordered a sourdough bread bowl with the baked potato soup...but the soup wasn't hot but lukewarm...  We will still keep giving this place a shot, I understand the opening scheme of things, so hopefully the next time we come, the food is like how it was the first day!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times, and every time I've been underwhelmed. Twice I ordered the turkey bacon avocado on focaccia, and one time I got a salad. Simply put, the prices are too high. Almost nine dollars for a salad or sandwich? I would gladly pay this amount for an amazing sandwich with a side included, or a salad with creative ingredients, but I haven't seen either out of this place. It's ok in a pinch, but I definitely wouldn't recommend going out of your way to try it. Boring menu and you will likely feel ripped off."}
{"text":"I had Kneaders for the first time yesterday for lunch. I was in the area for a doctors appointment and needed to rush back to work. I had heard about Kneaders and thought I would give it a try. The staff was friendly enough, they didn't go out of their way to suggest anything even after telling them it was my first time, which was okay...at the end what I want is good quality, great tasting food, even if that means having someone less enthusiastic prepare it, I'll take it. There is no point in having a bright and chirpy worker if my food is nasty. Any who let me say my food was beyond amazing! I ordered the large green avocado salad (half portion - which was a good size) and I practically licked my bowl! it was fresh, it was light yet filling. it was crisp, it was delicious! I was given a choice of bread and picked the baguette which was equally as good. I'm sad now that I don't have one close to my area, I want to try more of the menu items. OH, and while I didn't have any dessert or pastries the presentation alone in the display case made my mouth water! next time I'm definitely getting dessert."}
{"text":"Broccoli cheese soup was great, Turkey was chinsey on the cranberry turkey croissant. Bread pudding was weird. It was layers of sliced bread with granola in between. It wasn't moist like real bread pudding. I ordered a combo, which usually is half sandwich and salad or soup. Right? This was a full sandwich, half salad, cup soup and a drink. But since the sandwich had barely any meat on it, I put everything on one side of the croissant and made a real sandwich. But, the soup was good. And!! And! There's a drive thru....that was nice."}
{"text":"Waited 20 mins in drive through for a cinnamon bun ...!!! Hav to be to work n 5!!! Went inside they hav no help long line inside too...this place has went down....."}
{"text":"Incredible food!!!!  Once you walk through the first set of doors you immediately smell fresh bread and cinnamon that you can literally taste.  The soups, sandwiches, pastries, and breakfast are absolutely delicious.  If you haven't been to a Kneaders please stop in.  You will be pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant has a country theme and feel to it that radiates a warm and pleasant atmosphere.  Kneaders has a new customer!!"}
{"text":"We used to live in north Phoenix. I loved the cinnamon rolls at that Kneader's location. They were huge with lots of icing. The store managers knew our names and were so nice.  Since moving to Surprise I have been continually disappointed. The cinnamon rolls are small, often hard or stale tasting, have little icing on them, and if you ask for extra icing just to cover up the holes they refuse and say they don't have any.   Everything else on the menu is very comparable to other locations. I just miss the rolls and service at the other store."}
{"text":"Just another paradise/panera, corner bakery, cafe zupas wanna be! Horrible mid block location & ingress/egress + a drive thru! Who approves this stuff?!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here yesterday for the very first time & I was very pleasantly surprised by all the goodies they have. I purchased Roasted Red Pepper Gouda soup which comes with 2 slices of bread, amazing. Also purchased a loaf of Asiago Bread which is to die for especially when you spread butter on it. I will define coming back with friends & family.."}
{"text":"Mediocre food in a cute setting. I had to pick the moldy raspberries off of my Chicken Raspberry Nut salad. Yummy Raspberry Walnut vinaigrette dressing, though. Fully Loaded Baked Potato soup seemed only half-loaded and watery - good flavor but it should be thicker & have more goodies within. It'd be better with some cheese sprinkled on top, too. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and I'm so excited I'll be living near here soon.  They have the best tuna fish sandwich on this absolutely delicious whole grain break with nuts inside. Ahh! So good. They let me add provolone at no charge every time I ask. SCORE!  And their croissants...heavenly!  I also love the iced sugar cookies...seriously they are next level. I'd say they're easily the best as far as fast casual restaurants go. Definitely better than Panera.  I look forward to trying more of their baked goods because everything here is so fresh tasting and it doesn't \"feel\" like your typical chain restaurant.  The employees are friendly and helpful and cleanliness of the restaurant is on point- it's always pristine. Can't wait to become a more frequent customer of Kneaders!"}
{"text":"Food and service were both good. Didn't know they also served breakfast till 11am Monday through Saturday. Ordered the chicken salad croissant and a chocolate chunk cookie, both being above average. Prices were reasonable too."}
{"text":"I wish I could do 0 starts because this place was awful. I ordered online spending around 75.00. I placed the order at 2 for a pick up at 415.  So they had plenty of time not to screw this up. When I picked it up the place was dead. Maybe 3 people. It took them about 15 min. To get it all together and just a side note, they were very unfriendly.  I get the order home and what appeared to be a chicken sandwich with ham was almost comical. First, the chicken was over cooked and there was about 1 tsp. Of ham and I'm not too sure what the green stuff was. And could they spare the chips? Maybe 1/4 cup in the paper bag. The other sandwich I still can't even get over. We picked this chicken breast up and could knock it on the counter. And I'd like to say thanks for the canned broccoli soup.  I called and told them I wanted a refund. Which, this is why I guess they can keep the one star. They did refund me my money back. When I got there to return everything each and every single worker looked like they wanted to jump over the counter and attack me. but hey, it's all good. They offered to give me a voucher for 5 people to have dinner but we never saw that. Not that we would have. This isn't my first time here. Before was a salad that honestly is not worth the cost. I don't recommend this place at all. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ok...we decided to try this place, instead of going to Paradise Bakery. Well, the food was good, but the service was horrible. We ordered and the cashier was new and there was no one available to assist her. Then we sat down and waited...and waited...and waited. Finally I got up to see if the staff left and found out they were still there...helping others...anyway I could go on but you get the point...we won't be back!!! That's what we get for trying to escape Paradise!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast or even a quick lunch. The deserts are super fresh and amazing."}
{"text":"The service is usually pretty great here, and the pastries are comparable in prices to most pastry shops.  With one cashier, the service can be a bit slow at times when it's a semi full house.   I came here for the AYCE french toast served with caramel maple syrup with a side of strawberries and whip cream.  During the second round of french toast the strawberries and whip cream were left out, since they cost for another serving, which I thought was totally misleading.  The presentation of the second set was total lack luster, and not as great without the fresh strawberries.  My ultimate favorite is the free gift wrapping when I purchase their sweet treats as a present.  A real personal touch, that makes this place stand out."}
{"text":"Turkey avocado on French country will change your views on what a sandwich is capable of...it's that good. Top it off with raspberry bread pudding and your taste buds will thank you profusely:)"}
{"text":"I love Kneaders! But won't ever go back to this location. 30 minute wait for a sandwich to go?!?!?!? Manager here must just not be up to normal Kneaders standards. 3 stars rather than lower due to it being a holiday, great food, and friendly employees. Can't give higher though having to wait sooooo long."}
{"text":"OMG I JUST HAD THE BEST HAM AND SWISS SANDWICH. I got it on ciabatta bread. I am so glad I tried this place and maybe deep down a little sad since I'm probably just going to be massive soon from 5+ ham and Swiss sandwiches a day. lol Friendly staff and I got my food quick. Oh, I also got a fruit tart and it was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Went over today for a turkey, bacon, avocado on a baguette. Ordered the combo #1 with a cup of soup and a drink, and a chocolate croissant on the side. Got home and opened the bag. Half a sandwich? Really? For approx $15.50 total, I expect a whole sandwich- not half. Very disappointed. Also, when did you guys start putting the soup inside the sandwich box? It steams the bread and fillings so that I get lukewarm tomatoes, wet bread, and semi melted cheese. Gross. Please stop."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The wait for lunch was so long from finding parking to waiting to order that I wish that the process was more efficient. The friendly staff and fantastic food made up for a star I would have taken away!"}
{"text":"My life has been changed!   Let's review the facts: 1. I am mama to a 3 month old. 2. I enjoy meals that don't make me think \"I'm going to die\" or \"that was a mistake\" after consuming them. 3. I run a lot of errands in the Arcadia neighborhood.  I was delighted to find there was a drive thru alternative to Taco Bell* during my most  recent Yelp search. Cruising around with my little, I regularly find myself wrestling with waking him up to go inside or sacrificing taste for convenience. Wrestle no more! Kneaders has an incredible Turkey sandwich served with bacon and avocado on bread as big as my face. And it is delicious! And accessible via car with a drive thru! So stoked to try out the rest of the menu and enjoy it from their spacious parking lot in sleepy silence.  *I am not hating on Taco Bell here- I love me a Chalupa just as much as the next guy. However there is a time and a place for it. For me, that time is usually shortly after I lose my sobriety."}
{"text":"Panera mixed with cracker barrel = Kneaders. This was my first time inside of Kneaders but second time enjoying the food. It has a country store feel like cracker barrel and is similar to Panera with the menu. As you walk in you will pass all of the bakery items, and there are a lot!   Cookies, cupcakes, cinnamon rolls, fresh bread, cakes, pies, etc. As other reviews mentioned the wait at lunch time can be very long. Lines are out the door and the parking lot is packed. When we arrived at 11:00 there was no wait but the food still took quite some time.   I ordered the turkey, bacon avocado on sourdough. The sandwich is really big and the bread is so fresh and soft. The turkey is real turkey, not processed. I had a side of the quinoa salad which had black beans and corn added to it, it was good but the sandwich was filling by itself.   They have a nice drink bar with sodas, two different brewed coffees and three different iced teas. I like Kneaders much more than Panera and the drive thru is an added plus!"}
{"text":"Very nice interior, delicious latte and a cake Napoleon!"}
{"text":"On the morning of 5/24/16 I had to have some fasting blood work done and had some time for breakfast before I had to go to work. I thought cool I can check out Kneaders. I arrived at 07:35am.  I walk in and the place looks nice and there is no one else in the lobby. I see the menu and hoped to get a bagel. Well no bagels here so I decided on a breakfast sandwich. I walk up to the counter & wait. And wait. There is a guy working the drive thru and a young lady hanging near the kitchen waiting for food to come out so she can deliver it. The food comes up & she walks it into the dining room. On the way back she looks at me, yawns & goes back to the runners station where she had been hanging out. At this point nobody has greeted me or acknowledged that I even existed. No, someone will be right with you. Not a word. So, I walked out. That's all there was too this visit and I'm not even sure if I would return in the future, at this point I'm pretty turned off.  Plus if you're going north when you're  leaving this place you need to take the long way home."}
{"text":"We got breakfast here because my nephew says he likes it better than Starbucks. In the end we were disappointed. My sister got a Caffè latte and instead got an iced coffee. The omelettes are incredibly overpriced for how little food you actually get. The breakfast sandwiches we got were good, though they skimped on the bacon on my sister's sandwich. Buy we could've gone to Starbucks and gotten a cheaper sandwich that wouldn't fall apart. The frozen hot chocolate was good though. Very cocoa-y. I probably wouldn't go here again though."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Kneaders today for lunch. Some of us ordered  sandwiches and I ordered a half order of the turkey cranberry salad which was wonderful.  I love the fresh turkey breast that they used and it was a very generous portion.  The accompanying breads were delicious I had back yet but I also got a taste of the hazelnut bread yummy.  For dessert my friends and I shared a chocolate loaf cake which was loaded with chocolate chips.  All of us were extremely happy with our lunch.  I will return for other meals at Kneaders."}
{"text":"So I came here one night on march 22 for the first time. From all the yelp pictures i saw i was kinda excited.. but my experience there was NOT SO GOOD... I came here about 15 to 20 minutes before closing. When I parked my car the open sign was on but all the chairs were put on the table. when I walked in the entire store was covered in water... there was literally puddles of water everywhere. I was careful when i walked thru the floors to make sure i don't slip and fall. thankfully i didn't... that would not be a good thing for the restaurant if i did.   Anyways I went over to look at the dessert area and literally NO ONE was trying to help me. There were about 3 people working there and totally ignored me. I literally stood around for over 5 minutes waiting for help and finally had to call for help from someone behind the counter. The young girl working there acted very disinterested in taking my order. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup but unfortunately the tomato soup was all gone ..so they offered me a different soup.. which was fine.. i believe it was irish soup or something like that. anyways... after 10 or 15 minutes of them making this order it came out. I had also ordered 4 desserts as well... so when i got my bag before i left the store i checked to make sure everything was all there. Well everything was there alright .. but the soup was NOT HOT or even the slightest bit warm... it felt like it had been sitting out all day and was just room temperature at best. I was shocked!! i mean if i ordered hot soup i would like hot or at least warm soup. Well i didn't want to complain cause they were closing up shop and the people that worked there seemed like they hated their job ..and who knows what they would do to my soup if i asked for it to be hotter. It was a risk i didn't want to take... the grilled sandwich was warm to the touch tho. When i got home tho which i live 5 minutes away i grilled up the sandwich again ...and heated up the soup on the stove to be hot. The food was tasty... not too bad. BUT the level of service I got for it wasn't worth the hassle.  Now.. the 4 desserts I got also tasted not bad.. but was a bit pricey for a small cake.. a cupcake.. an eclair and a mouse.   Overall.. this place is NOT WORTH coming back to. I was extremely disappointed and upset that day when i came there and felt like I should have taken my money and spent it somewhere else that deserved my money. With so many other options out there in vegas.. I would encourage others to try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I LOVED my Thai Salad and iced coffee today :) The salad was so fresh and colorful! I loved the dressing - defiantly would buy it bottled up. My iced coffee was great, I really enjoy the flavor of their coffee, its not too rich, but also has a ton of flavor. This is one of my fav go to lunch spots - to grab something fresh!   Also the girl at the window is always so nice.  Thats all. @Art_beauty_n_fitness"}
{"text":"I usually don't have issues with Kneaders but I just couldn't help but laugh at my salad when I got it.. pretty simple order for waiting over ten minutes in line for a Half Turkey bacon avacado salad... I got what I presume is supposed to be bacon.. or remnants of what once was a part of a piece of bacon.. I usually go to the one on 9th street and Bell so I'll probably stick to them from now on... they give me more than a sliver of bacon so... lmao"}
{"text":"Was hoping for more but got much less French toast was gross . Breakfast options are a joke . Coffee isn't terrible tho and the bread samples where good."}
{"text":"Nope.... Visited on based on Review Journal article. Came on Saturday afternoon after 2pm for coffee and a treat and to take a loaf of bread home. Not including the time it took to stand in line to place order, it took 22min (based on receipt) to put bread in a bag and a piece of pie and bread pudding on plates. There was no cooking or prep involved! Then it was brought to us in a to-go-bag because they knew we were waiting so long and thought we may want to leave.   There were no prices in the display case. What they brought was not worth what they charged: pie and bread pudding were both $3.99 each. It tasted fine,  but my mood ruined the flavor. They sliced the loaf bread we ordered, and we asked them not to. While we were in line, someone else returned a mistaken order (they gave her the wrong bag).  It seems as though they were spending too much effort in the sale of bakery baskets with all the wrappings and knick -knacks to dress it up in. I would hate to be that person who actually attempt to have a basket put together. Plan on being there for 3 hours...  I won't make the short drive to come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place for breakfast. The inside was very cute and charming. I ordered a Greek omelet which was absolutely fantastic. Well seasoned and plenty of ingredients. My husband had a piece of cheesecake and we each had a cafe latte. The store was clean and the service was great. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty terrible. 3 of us each got a different sandwich and they were all bad. I got the surf sandwich I think, I could make the equivalent or better by getting some of Albertsons seafood salad and throwing it on some Hawaiian rolls. The only reason kneaders gets 2 stars and not 1 is there desserts. I don't eats sweets myself, but everyone I know loves certain things like the German chocolate bread pudding, tarts, pies etc."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to a Kneaders.  The place is clean with lots of food and pastry options.  I had the egg omelette with feta and spinach with a side of toast, fruit and jelly.  It was very good.  The omelette was so thin, very crepe like, but I liked that.  Free refills on drinks at their drink station.  I'll definitely be back to try their other stuff - including their cookies that looked really good!"}
{"text":"I  have been wanting to go to a Kneaders for a very long time and it did not disappoint. It is the cutest place. The chicken salad sandwich was very good and I am a Chicken Salad snob.   I brought home a loaf of their coconut pineapple bread which is fantastic. Their salted caramels are good, not the best I have had, but good. All in all I would definitely come back here. The decor is so charming too. They have a little gift store section."}
{"text":"Just meh! Went after a funeral on a Friday evening. The place was busy but not sold out. Dessert case is very tempting with everything picture perfect.   I ordered the Asiago Bisque in a bread bun. Husband ordered a pastrami on honey wheat. Kid ordered kid's ham and cheese. Three eclair, ALL to go.  Everything was presented nicely. Service was great. Girl was pleasant and explained the menu to us.   Food was just ok. My husbands sandwich looked liked something I would have made at home. My son's ham and cheese was just that, ham and cheese, no lettuce or tomato, I guess you have to ask for it.  The star sugar cookie that comes with his meal was absolutely horrible. Void of any sweetness except for the red icing on top. My soup was good but I have had better. Asiago is a white cheese and this soup was orange. Please just call it cheese soup.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with our meal I was just expecting more for $30+ dollars. It was quick, easy and a healthier option than Popeye's next door but we probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"First trip here. A friend said it was a good place for breakfast. Place was very clean. They deliver your food to the table. The bread was very good. We ended missing breakfast by 5 minutes so I ended up having a wrap.  If you are in for a sandwich, soup? This is a good place to visit."}
{"text":"I see a lot of reviews with 4 or more stars and for me, in order for a business to get that much stars it just needs be on point in every aspect- service, food, environment, creativeness. So with that being said this place does offer some delish food and the staff were friendly especially for having just opened up (we were there first thing). Fresh breads are always a nice option and with this place being nearby, its good to know its there. We tried a few of their breakfast pastries and nothing bad. I also bought some Pumpkin bread which my dad really liked and like my kid, he's a tough person to please food wise...and in everything else but I digress.   Now the reason for the 3 stars, nothing really bad about the place but nothing really WOW's me about it either. It offers the cafe staples: sandwiches, pastries, desserts, coffee, smoothies and fresh breads. It even has a small retail area and they do gift baskets right there for you. The shop is new and clean looking but again, nothing really to exciting to make me want to revisit soon. Well since the holidays are coming up, this would be a great spot for holiday breads and such."}
{"text":"First time at Kneader and eat here on a Tuesday Morning with not to many people there.   The restaurant is where you order at the counter and then they bring the food to you. Was not expecting that initially but kind if liked the setup.   The restaurant is kind of like a store, bakery and restaurant.    Tried the Endless French Toast and Ham and Egg Breakfast Sandwich Croissant. The Endless French Toast is prepared on Texas Size Toast so you really can't eat too many slices. The French Toast itself is pretty good but did not knock my socks off.  The Ham and Egg Sandwich on the Croissant was actually pretty good but almost seem a little sparse.  Overall not too bad if you are not looking for a nice sit down breakfast place but want something more on the quick side."}
{"text":"Came all the way here over 6 miles from home . It's before 9:00 am and no croissant bread ... You know for there croissant breakfast , the primary breakfast sandwich ."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! I and my wife got one Greek omelette and a coffee, which they so nicely separated into two plates. The whole thing was less than ten bucks and super yummy! Besides, they have free sample pastries and bread you can sample on while you wait (or eat for dessert hehe). On top of that, you can keep refilling your coffee, tea or soda for free. We tried the tea, it was gross, but the coffee was good. Another great aspect is the clean and cozy atmosphere: pretty wood furniture and classic Americana decorations (some to buy) are pretty cool... Felt like eating at my grandmas. Pro Tip: If you are super hungry, get the pancakes or french toast - they have unlimited refills of your plate... all you can eat pancakes or french toast sounds like a deal for two people trying to save moola."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, good food, very polite service, reasonable prices.  This place was recommended by my nieces, and I decided to try it out. I'm glad I did! Kneaders is part bakery, part restaurant, and part crafts fair. When you walk in, you will notice the warm, homey décor right away. I ordered right away, and while waiting for my food, I took a look around. There is jewelry for sale, a section of ribbon spools, and a few other random things- I felt like I walked into my sister-in-law's kitchen. It was very clean, and soon my order was ready.  All the food is fresh, light and HUGE. I ordered the turkey bacon avocado on foccia, and just couldn't resist a canoli, too. The foccia bread was a little thick, but the turkey was fresh cut. Cut, not sliced. very delicious. the canoli was good, too - not too sweet, a little crunch, and a great little dash of chocolate. With so much bread, I wish there had been a little more mayo, but otherwise, it was delicious. will definitely come back again."}
