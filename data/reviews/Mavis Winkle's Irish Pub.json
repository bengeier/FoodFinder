{"text":"DO NOT USE THESE GUYS FOR CATERING!!!!!! They were to cater a brunch on Sunday morning and never showed up! Or at least not for over an hour. We waited for over an hour before giving up. Imagine! And then when I called on Monday, \"Kevin\" was in a meeting and was to call me back. Did he? Hell no. So no food, no explanation, no apology. Disgraceful performance!"}
{"text":"Love it, Guinness on tap and proper pour. Good atmosphere and friendly service.  I would recommend this for any Guinness lover."}
{"text":"Came in with a group of about 20.  We had a reservation and we were seated immediately, even though we were about 15 minutes early.  Our waitress was very friendly and did a nice job taking care of such a large group.  They have a nice beer selection.  We had the Pierogi appetizer (it was OK) and I had the Italian Beef Sandwich, which was good but the beef was a little fatty.  On par with your average Applebee's in my opinion.  Likely wouldn't go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Mavis, Mavis, Mavis.  What has happened to you?  We've been going for years and there has been a steady downward trend.  Primary issue is that the menu is just bloated, with the majority of items nowhere near Irish.  Hummus, flatbreads, pasta alfredo, key lime pie, pierogis, seafood tacos, and on.  Back in the day they would at least try with \"O'Toole's Chicken Paprikash\" or \"Paddy's Chicago Style Italian Beef,\" but no longer. More traditional Irish items have disappeared (boxty appetizer, colcannon, banoffi, to name a few). It's really just an American restaurant now with a few token or quasi Irish dishes, if you're lucky (\"we'll have the reuben spring rolls as an appetizer\"....\"oh, we're out of those.\"). I realize that a restaurant needs to appeal to everyone, but just be done with it and make it Mavis Winkle's Neighborhood Bar and Grille.

I generally get the corned beef and cabbage because...Irish!  It's a simple, but well done dish; the corned beef is lean, and the cabbage/carrots are well-cooked.  Colcannon has been replaced by two scoops of dry, crumbly mashed garlic redskins.  Pass. Husband's corned beef boxty was good, kid's cheese quesadilla tasted of burnt oil.  Very strange.

Service is all over the place - our server this visit was good and attentive, but it's really hit or miss."}
{"text":"We went for dinner - he had to send back his mushy fish and cold chips that weren't fully cooked.  I had the bangers and mash - the sausage was dry Italian sausage, the garlic mashed potatoes had no flavor; there was about one tablespoon of gravy on the whole thing. The snow peas were disgusting, floating in oil and salty. 

Obviously, we will never go back. The waitress was good, but a manager never came over after my husband sent back his meal."}
{"text":"This place has promise, but it's confused. Is it an Irish Pub? Is it a \"gastro pub\" as it purports? In my opinion it's none of those. It is okay for some drinks, but that's about it. The food and service has declined considerably over the years. 

The menu is varied, but the preparation and quality of food is not very good. Staple Irish fare is poor, the fish and chips is irretrievably bad. I think they used pancake batter on the fish, and the chips were Sysco's specials. The wings were rubbery. The BBQ bacon cheeseburger featured a gargantuan, inedible onion ring, coated in two pounds of pancake batter. Aside from its temperature approaching that of molten glass, the onion wasn't properly peeled, it seriously looked like a donut. The pretzel bun was okay, I grade it a C, and that's generous.

The atmosphere is the best part of this place. If you're looking for pub ambience, this is the place. If you're looking for some good food, you're going to be disappointed, unless you are satisfied with mediocre pedestrian food service fare dressed up as gastro pub creations.

I hope they get better soon."}
{"text":"Horrible food...service...management.  Three meals out of 4 had to be returned for various reasons.  Waitress did not listen to orders and some of the items of food were missing.  Manager asked what was wrong and we told him.  He explained there were new people in the kitchen.  He did not offer a free drink or something off the bill."}
{"text":"After rolling thru 4 brightly lit bars thru twinsburgh. This joint was the coolest around. Irish coffee on point. Burger was too perfect. Great stop n eat. Wonderful beer selection. I would deff come back. If I lived close I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"If Zero stars was a choice that's what this place would have!!

Short version

Horrible for large group. Staff hates their life. You will be there for hours. Food had bugs in it and very unorganized. 

I called 6 days prior to make reservations for a large group . Person who answered was super friendly! The day of the event someone called to confirm was asked if it would be one check or separate .. I said separate. I arrived and mentioned the reservation to the girl , and she said they were setting up . Then a man who I think was the manager asked who the party was under and how many people I told and he had a rude comment bc he didn't think I had a reservation. Once  he found the reservation his was a little more friendly. Once we were seated we had a girl who hates life. Service was slow, server was rude!!!! The place was very short staffed. There was a bug in someone's salad ( they did replace it and didn't charge for it ). They also charged someone's credit card twice. I could go on but I won't!"}
{"text":"I had a surprise birthday party at Mavis Winkle's for my husband and they did a really great job. We chose to have 2 hours of endless appetizers (6 different types and all good). The staff took very nice care of us and I was very happy to leave at the end with nothing to clean up or drag home!"}
{"text":"When for lunch a few weeks ago. I ordered the avocado BLT, it took about 25 minutes for our lunch to show up and when it did I had bacon lettuce tomato no avocado and no dressing. Every time we asked our waitress for something that was missing from our lunches she got upset or annoyed that we are asking for what was expected to be on our lunch orders. No manager ever came out to address issues that we had with almost every single order every person placed nor did they remove any money from our bill."}
{"text":"Monday night I went here for happy hour and it was excellent great service the drinks was on point in the food is better"}
{"text":"Mavis Winkle's is a fun Irish restaurant and bar located in Twinsburg right off 480 on 91. There's another location in Independence. Granted, most of the food isn't Irish in any way, but really, how big of a menu would you have if you only had Irish food anyhow? The area around the bar has a fun atmosphere, while the main dining area in the back feels more bland. We sat in the bar area. The staff is very friendly and helpful. For an appetizer, we had the reuben bites, which are really addicting. They're small fried dough balls stuffed with corned beef, cheese, and sauerkraut and come with thousand island dressing to dip them in. For an entree, I had the shepards pie, which was good, but not outstanding. It was a giant bowl of ground beef, root veggies, and corn all in thick gravy. It came with mashed potatoes, which were really good. The shepards pie was good, but it wasn't memorable. That being said, Mavis Winkles is still a really good place to grab a bite to eat with some great menu items, even if it isn't all Irish."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  I ordered the potato soup but the cream had separated. The calamari were soggy. Do not order from Cravecle, Eat216 or Food Fetchers at this restaurant. The company surcharges all items, and adds food charges to your order. Perhaps the food would be better if it wasn't delivered by this fraudulent company. Whatever you do, do not order from George Seoud!"}
{"text":"Gave this spot a shot today for dinner/drinks.  Sat at the half empty bar for over 10 mins & got nothing but occasional blank stares from the 2 girls behind the counter.  We left disappointed and spent our $ elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to Cleveland for a few days to explore. Nice, big, clean open space. Pleasant staff. Good service. It was in between lunch & dinner when we came in   Happy hour prices were nice. Had rueben spring rolls which were very good& I would highly recommend. My husband had a corned beef sandwich, it was dry but not terrible.  Lots of beers on draft to choose from. It's nothing special but if you are just looking for somewhere to kill time & grab a beer and app this would be the place. I'm not disappointed. Oh yeah and the bathrooms are really big & nice & clean!!!"}
{"text":"I have never been more disappointed in a meal in my life. Even though it was St. Patrick's Day, you would think that an Irish pub could make a good corned beef. My boyfriend ordered corner beef and cabbage. He described it as rubbery. The cabbage with shredded carrot was more like a garnish. I ordered the boxty. My corned beef was dry and flavorless. My machine made sad excuse for a potato pancake tasted like salty grease. It was vile! At $12.99 per meal his potions were small and left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"We visited on a Wednesday night.  We were greeted quickly by the hostess and told that the air conditioning was out in the bar.  We sat in there anyway and at first it was tolerable, but the service was very slow, and the heat was stifling before too long.  We were at our table for several minutes before seeing our server, despite the fact that it wasn't busy.  We actually thought of leaving because of it.

The menu was nothing like the one listed online -- we were told it was \"in transition\" and to ask if anything we wanted was actually still available.  No pierogis (which is a weird thing to have in an Irish pub anyway).  The shepherd's pie was odd -- no peas or carrots, but celery and corn instead.  It also didn't have the traditional layer of potatoes on top and just had a dollop on top instead.  Chicken paprikash was just a bunch of doughy noodles and sauce, with not much chicken.  The sauce was tasty though.  There was a decent selection of adult beverages.

The server was slow throughout our stay, and it took forever to pay our bill.  The hostess, however, wouldn't leave us alone.  I got the impression that she was either bored or hitting on one of my friends, because she just kept coming to our table, but wasn't helping bring food or drinks -- she just wanted to chat.  This was particularly annoying because we were seeing friends who we hadn't seen in years and our conversation kept getting interrupted.

All in all, I think Mavis Winkle's is past its prime, and I would definitely not be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our children along with my in-laws, who highly recommended the place.  It was a Saturday night, around 6, and very few tables were occupied.  I was really looking forward to eating here for the first time, as I hadn't had corned beef in awhile and had a taste for it.  When the waitress came to take our drink order she seemed a bit put out to have to wait on us (can't quite put my finger on it).  She returned to take our food order and that was the last we saw of her at our table.  We called over another waitress (who was quite pleasant) because something was wrong with one of our drinks, and when she returned she informed us that she would be our waitress from that point on.  It seemed as if it took forever for our food to arrive and by the time it did mine was cold (however the flavor was good and the corned beef was lean).  We were there so long that I did not accept her offer to reheat my dish, as I just wanted to get on with our evening.  By the time we finished and got our check I realized that we had been there for 2 hours and 15 minutes - and we never even had desert or and appetizer!  Those of you with small children know what a challenge it is to keep them entertained for that long of a sitting.  I don't really think that I will be returning, unless it's to order carry out."}
{"text":"Good food, average drinks.

They have party rooms meant to accommodate large groups but don't have the staff to keep up with the larger groups.

9pm came and the place was a ghost town. Irish pub empty after 9pm seemed odd."}
{"text":"Went to Mavis Winkles in Twinsburg on 12/7/2013 for lunch. In a short time, they broke 2 critical health code violations (I included both violations below) with the food they tried to serve me. The clever waiter served my corned beef sandwich to the patron behind me. After the patron picked it up and noticed it wasn't his, he called the waiter back over to tell him he didn't order this, the waiter took it back to the kitchen, waited 20 mins and re-served me the same sandwich. When I confronted the waiter, he admitted to the critical error and thought it would be ok, he even added, \"but I did give you fresh mashed potatoes\". It wasn't until after I complained he would offer to replace my sandwich with a fresh one.

I went directly to the GM. After getting an insincere apology, he offered to comp my meal. But what was there to comp? All I had was 2 beers. If a waiter had the nerve to serve me old food, what else could he do to my food after I complained? I didn't want to take that chance nor could I trust him or the GM.

The GM then tried to blame the waiter for inexperience. I told him, I had the same waiter 3 months ago and had lousy service then. I didn't know it takes waiters 3 months to learn how to serve the food properly. Then the GM created another excuse, he said \"I'm having a hard time to get quality applicants. I only started 3 weeks ago and I have to work with I can get.\" What kind of excuse is that?

I've been a long time customer to both locations and I don't know if I can ever return or even suggest Mavis as a goto place. I've had many great experiences here, but this one incident changed everything.

The owners Bill & MaryJo Demopoulis were contacted durning this and have my contact info, still haven't received a call or email.

It's been over a month and still no contact from the owners.  I've made several attempts to reach them.

{"text":"Still a 2 star experience.  Ordered some takeout for lunch and was told it would be ready in 5 minutes.  20 minutes later I was still waiting, and watched more than one group get frustrated at the lack of acknowledgement when they came in and wanted to be seated.  I got the thai salad with oranges instead of chicken, and the oranges were really great.  They should consider adding them permanently.  The salad overall, however, was a disappointment.  Dirt clumps on the lettuce and no broccoli.  To me it is a huge deal to list an ingredient in the description on the menu and then just leave it out without mention.  The portion size for the buffalo chicken appetizer looked pretty small for the price ($9); I would have expected at least 50% more."}
{"text":"I had a less than satisfying experience during my last visit to their Twinsburg location about a year ago, but I was pleasantly surprised when I recently had dinner at the Independence location.  I don't know if there are differences between the two restaurants, or maybe just some changes happened over the last year to make it better.  The space is enormous.  I'll have to keep it in mind for future group events.  I also was pleased to notice many health-conscious options on the menu.  I love the idea of getting the salads in a wrap, too!  The biggest negative I'd say is the cocktail I had.  It wasn't bad, but unremarkable."}
{"text":"I would have never thought I'd have left a place called \"Mavis Winkle's\" feeling as satisfied as I was. But this was a pleasant surprise.

I tried to stalk D&DS but they broke down (funny thing, I was on 77 South and saw their truck smoking at the side of the road. Actually, no, let me reword that: it wasn't funny that their truck was smoking, but it was funny to see them there considering I was on my way to 4200 Rockside to get some of their stuff).

AAAAAnyway, I happened to have a $10 off coupon for Mavis Winkle's on me because of a race I ran (it came in the goody bag). So we went, and I really can't complain!

I had a salad with blackened salmon atop romaine, almonds, and feta. What a treat! I couldn't believe it. The salmon was not just cold and dumped on there with no thought. It was hot and fresh, and cooked PERFECTLY! Really good, and just a little spicy. Derek got a boring chicken sandwich. Whatevs.

Everyone there was really nice, it was spacious, and they had huge screens with sports projected onto them (if I cared about that sort of thing, I'd be really happy about that). Seems like a great happy hour spot. Would love to come back with a group."}
{"text":"Goos service and nice atmosphere.  Greasy fish and cold fries...just like Ireland. Overall just average.

There are many other excellent choices in the area so give this one a pass."}
{"text":"Good Irish pub food.  I threw down w/ some Guinness and Corned Beef.  Lots of good food, good atmosphere and good spirits.  Definitely will try again."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant in the past and enjoyed their menu. 

Tonight I went in at 8:53 happy that I had just made it. (The sign states kitchen open until 9:00 bar open til 10:00). 

I had only a snack for lunch and was very hungry. 
After waiting several minutes, the hostess came and told me \"the kitchen is closing at 9 o'clock\". 

I really had a taste for shepherds pie and was looking forward to it.

Imagine my surprise when I believed I had arrived in time for a delicious meal and was turned away. 

I am extremely disappointed in this restaurant!!!

Is this treatment of customers why their Independence location closed?"}
{"text":"For an Irish styled restaurant that promotes celebrating St. Patrick for an entire week, St. Patrick's DAY sure snuck up on em. 
My friend and I showed up at 10:55am before it started getting crowded. We ordered our corned beef and reuben sandwiches at 11:05. Fast forward to 12:50pm and the first sandwich shows up...a corned beef with Swiss on rye bread(as it appeared on the menu). Well it was served without Swiss. I asked for a new sandwich prepared right, and 10 seconds later I had the same sandwich in front of me with 2 cold slices of Swiss cheese. I know I'm starting to sound picky. Well as this was going to be the first thing we ate for the day, I gave my friend half of my sandwich because his didn't come out at the same time. After reminding the waitress the first time, we had to remind her again, and voilà 30 minutes later the second sandwich.
As all of his was happening I watched the poor line of take out people waiting for over an hour for food they ordered ahead of time. 
Usually good food and good service. Not so much on this day."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with the wife today.  Love the atmosphere.  Food was decent.  I had fish and chips, a full order, and the portion was huge.  It was good although the breading/batter was a bit on the thick and heavy side.  Not the best fish and chips I have had but I would order it again.

The service was good.  Our server was attentive and checked on us several times.

Overall it was a decent experience and I would return."}
{"text":"I have only come to this place a couple of times and it has been a good experience every time. This restaurant is really great to go to during lent because they have a ton of options besides fish. The service has not been bad and we have enjoyed ourselves every time we have come. They keep the restaurant very clean and tidy. The staff is very nice and respectful."}
{"text":"We use Mavis Winkle's a couple of times a month to cater our meetings. We have always been satisified. The food is good, hearty, and a bit different than the usual catered meeting boxed lunch. They have always been on time too. 

Everyone LOVES their colcannon and corned beef."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting much to be honest. Their menu seems too large to be done well. We went for the music on a Saturday night. The place was absolutely packed. Burgers good but overcooked. Garlic wings good. Acceptable bar food. We didn't venture far from typical bar selections on the menu.  Service impressively accurate  and attentive given the volume of patrons in a short window of service before music began. Will be back for another night of music soon."}
{"text":"Had the Shepard's Pie here and my coworker had the fish and chips.  Like most places in Ohio, order a half or you are taking it home, or in my case the hotel.  This place has a great environment, and the staff is nice but not overbearing.  It is a good location to come by and just hang out."}
{"text":"Fun place. Classic Irish pub feel. Very good Reuben. Clean, well lit...cheesy irish canned music was a bit too loud. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the Twinsburg area! Really friendly service, amazing Irish coffee, and delicious food. Get their Mad Reuben and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great time and food.  Band No Stangers Here was Excellent.  Wonderful time and highly recommended.  Only suggestion would be to keep the kitchen open later."}
{"text":"Excellent fish fry, boxies, and beer. Fast and friendly service too."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, not great food this time. We go here at least 10x per year.  Saturday night and no bangers and mash?? Seems off since that is an Irish staple.  Instead, we ordered the prime rib special.  Big mistake.  No flavor and lots of gristle, but we should have known better ordering prime rib at an Irish pub.  Our server was fantastic and the atmosphere was great. Hopefully, this was just a blip and not an indicator of what is to come."}
{"text":"I like this place-the food is ok but that's not what really makes the place it is the service and drinks. This is an Irish Pub the Irish food is the only thing worth ordering off the menu. Don't try to be different here. I can not say enough good things about the service... the people are soo nice, relaxed and accommodating. My brother in law got married on St. Pattys day this p[ast year and the rehearsal was here the night before...we had a blast!!!"}
{"text":"The Guinness onion soup was very good. Unfortunately, this may have been the worst shepherd's pie I've eaten for awhile; the potatoes were bland and proportionally small compared with the beef.  The beef was low quality (decomposed meatballs?) without the stewed flavor I expected. However, the service and atmosphere was decent - what you'd expect from a bar.  The recipe and menu tends to change, so it's been a bit of a hit or miss for me. My husband did enjoy his Reuben sandwich though."}
{"text":"been coming here on and off for awhile now and occasionally get the chicken paprikash - every time I get it the portion is different. Same thing with fries - we had two different portions on our plates last night.  The kash I get is full size, $13, no longer worth it. The food itself has been good, but no longer feel like I'm getting WHAT I ordered.  They also have this \"pub club\" that NOONE knows how to work it or addresses it when u order.  I'm sad they were my go to."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and maybe a bar nibble before an appointment.  Peak happy hour, hardly anyone in the place.  OK, that was my signal.   As you entered there was a sign that said $4 wine on Thurs, I thought perfect, keep it light before the appointment.  Grabbed a seat at the bar, asked what reds they had, asked for the Malbec.  No indication anywhere of other happy hour specials or bar food specials, until midway through I went to the mens room and saw a poster about happy hour specials.  Well unless they are serving the specials in the men's room, that was a bad place to place the sign.   The wine was OK, i've had better Malbecs.  The bar maid had an attitude, well not a bad bad attitude, but it was not one that made you feel welcome, or even that she enjoyed her job.   With so few people at the place, maybe at least a bartender with a personality would keep or attract customers.  Oh and as far as that $4 wine special, my check was $7.  For $3 I was not going to squabble, I just won't come back.    Pull your act together Mavis, this is not working!"}
{"text":"I have been to an \"Irish Pub\" or two, but Mavis Winkle's does up some fine fare and in a great atmosphere.

They have  a wide and varied menu, with great seafood, amazing burgers, and sides like their wonderful potato soup and salads that will just make you want more. In addition, the biscuits that come with every order were sweet and wonderful and just added to the joy of the meal. 

Their wine, beer and spirits selection is another plus, and after we had a slice of the raspberry cheesecake (a shared splurge for Valentine's Day) the meal, along with the innate warmth of the place was tremendous. You would never have guessed this was a restaurant in an office building. 

On top of it all, we had wonderful service. The meal came out a bit slow, but it was worth it as each course was nicely timed. All in all, a great time, and a restaurant that I, for one, will be going back to."}
{"text":"Darn good food. Had the shepherds pie. Very authentic.  Everyone else liked what they had too."}
{"text":"With several options for veggies like me, and still a great menu for meat eaters, this is one of our go to dinner spots. 

Friendly staff, clean, great pricing, good food."}
{"text":"This is a good solid 4 stars. From the time you walk in you get the feel of being in a Irish Pub. Ambience is a lot and this place has it. 

Service was friendly and took good care of us. The place was busy but not overly crowded. We enjoyed the game on the big screen and the whole place was cheering. 

The menu was not limited to corned beef or other normal Irish meals but had the important ones. The non Irish dishes were appealing as well. 

All said, we will visit here again when in town. A very good experience."}
{"text":"It was ok. The fish was cooked really well. The burger was so-so. The bartender/server was very friendly though. And this place is pretty big and has a relaxed atmosphere. I'll probably come again sometime and try something else."}
{"text":"Come here once a year for annual luncheon, and each year I wonder why we continue to come back here. Food is not good, several people commented that the corned beef was terrible (pretty bad for an \"Irish\" pub). Service was good though for a large group though."}
{"text":"I enjoy stopping here for lunch. the service is fast and food is very good. I especially enjoy the Salmon Boxty. The burgers are good too. There is always a nice selection of beer and drink specials."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice and the high top chairs are very fitting for an Irish pub. I got the citrus salad and it was very good, there was a nice serving of chicken for only ordering a half. My date got a BBQ bacon burger, it was okay. The fries are battered, so they were good. However the lettuce and onions on the burger seemed a bit old and dry, also it was vey greasey. My date had to wash his hands afterward. However the service was fast and overall has an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Since this was an Irish pub, I wasn't sure the Gyro would be the best choice  
But what a pleasant surprise--it was one the best Gyro's I ever had. Plenty of lamb and Sauce
Also had a great selection of craft and bottled beers
Will definitely come back whenever I'm in this Twinsburg area"}
{"text":"I have frequented this location as well as the Independence one a few times each. I must say I like this spot a lot more. Maybe since the Independence one gets so much business traffic the service never felt that great. But the Twinsburg spot is a much better experience. Let's start  with the interior design, this place just has the feel of a cool Irish pub. The food is bar type food, with a healthy mix of \"Irish\" food. This means there are plenty of options with corned beef, boxty, and some shepherd's pie. The service seems to always be friendly, and the drinks are quality. In all, if you are looking for a goof pub style meal, and great service, hit this Mavis Winkles location."}
{"text":"I went to Mavis Winkles on an afternoon when the traffic on I-77 was too congested to get to Akron in any appeciable time frame.  I have eaten there on one occasion in the past but don't have any \"outstanding\" memories of my meal.  

The restaurant/bar is reminiscent of Rocknes or On Tap.  The wine list was what I'd expect from a chain-type gimmick restaurant... over-priced and under-impressive.  I opted for a glass of merlot and the corned beef deep fried roll appetizer (the roll was sensational and BIG!)  So good in fact that I ordered one to go for my boyfriend!  I settled on the Chicken Paprikash for my dinner because it's peculiar to find on a menu (why is it on an Irish Pub menu??)  It was served with spaetzle and was surprisingly good.  The rye bread served with it was a bit greasy but the paprikash gravy cut the richness when I dipped it. 

Overall it was a nice restaurant to go to while waiting for traffic to die down but I think it is \"much ado about nothing\"."}
{"text":"This place has a very distinct chain atmosphere.  If you go to an \"Irish Pub\" for Easter brunch I guess you get what you deserve!  My wife made a last minute decision to do brunch for Easter so there wasn't a lot of choice regarding where.  I picked Mavis's because the advertised menu indicated a roast lamb and ham carving station and I love freshly carved lamb.  Imagine my chagrin when there was no carving station, the lamb provided in a steamer tray was dried out and tough, and the rest of the buffet was mediocre.  This may be an OK place to go for a Guinness and some chain-style pub food, but don't expect anything other than that.  I certainly don't recommend the $23 brunch."}
{"text":"I gotta admit, I was kind of shocked.  I expected a one-star experience, but it was ok.

We had a gift card from Christmas and figure we better use it.

Service was ok to start off with, but once the food was delivered the server went M.I.A.  Only to return for the check.  I understand if folks don't want to be bothered, but would it have killed them to top off even the ice water, or ask about another beer?  We were one and done, we left for drinks elsewhere.

The food was surprisingly ok...I fully expected lots of frozen, blah, microwaved foods, but all of ours were ok."}
{"text":"I'm sure that Irish food in Ireland is wonderful, but here in the US, Irish themed places are def not my go to kind of place. Mavis' location is great, right off I-480 and SR 91. There is a bit of a surprise with the menu that includes burritos, tacos, Pierogi, and gyros. And some good versions of these dishes.

The interior decor is quirky and fun for a strip mall location, and the service is (as with many places in this area) well intentioned but lacking in execution. Please, restaurant managers, let your people know that delivering food from the end of the table and then letting your guests distribute the food is a BAD practice. We're dining in your restaurant to feel welcomed and served. 

Overall, this place offers a decent product and service, but nothing out of the park. If you're traveling I 480, give it a shot."}
{"text":"I have been to Mavis throughout the years from when I was younger in school to now as an adult. It feels like it has gone through many different owners/managers but some of the same staff has been there throughout it all. 

Whatever is going on now is the best its been. I order take out from them and they even offer curbside and easy ordering on their app. The takeout food is always the same portion, hot and fresh, and they provide you cute napkins tied around silverware. I like that they include the to go menu in the bags and the monthly specials. 

The meatloaf is my jam, it is a great cut and fills ya up, but i order the full size because its worth it. The mashed potatoes are smooth with a touch of garlic and the fresh veggies are always amazing. I like it when they do the zucchini and carrots. Best part is they don't charge more for veggies you can get any \"classic side\" with most dishes. Other things I love are the pierogies & hummus platter. 

The salads are also great portions that actually fill you up and they have a lot of delicious unique dressings like cilantro sesame. 

True Irish pub feel with great glass doors, Celtic fireplace, and nice sized private space for parties. We had my mothers rehearsal dinner there and it was a great set up. 

We will continue to be a regular here, more so now that everything has consistently been great for the past few months!!"}
{"text":"An Irish pub in the ground floor of an office tower in Independence, Ohio? I know what you're thinking, there's no way that could be good. Well, my friend, you are right. It's not. Our visit, our second to a Mavis Winkles (our last was about 6 years ago at their Twinsburg location) and our first to this location (we were here last when it was a Cooker) was on a Thursday around 6pm. 

The atmosphere, where to begin. There's really nothing authentic about Mavis Winkles. It's just another wannabe pseudo-Irish bar/restaurant that comes off more like a rundown Applebee's than a neighborhood pub. The menu calls it a \"gastrohouse\" whatever the hell that means and, aside from some tchotchke hanging on the walls I'm more Irish than this place. The crowd was your typical after work groupies, clad in office apparel, drinking and commiserating. Not a bad vibe. We were greeted by the hostess when we entered and seated in the bar area. Great, we thought, bars tend to have better service. We were wrong.

We sat at our table (loose bench padding included) and after about 10 minutes the bartender came over. That's when the excuses started flowing like a sermon from the mouth of a greasy televangelist. \"I apologize for the wait\", \"Everything's a mess tonight\", \"I came in tonight to a disaster\", \"It's usually not like this\" complete with rolling eyes and shaking head, as if this made what was about to happen somewhat excusable. She took our drink order and we put in our appetizer. It couldn't possibly get worse, right?

We finished our salad and waited. And waited. And waited. The bar was buzzing at this point and we could clearly overhear the frustration spreading to the surrounding tables. Our server/bartender had retreated behind the bar again and we sat, empty salad plate and empty drinks, for nearly 20 minutes. It would have been longer had my wife not literally stood up and flagged down a server as she was scurrying past. The bartender eventually returned, complete with more apologies and the promise of a comped salad and drinks.

Look, I'm not a complete asshole. I understand that shit happens, especially in the service industry. People quit, they call off, there are scheduling conflicts, I get it. I just don't want to hear about it and I certainly don't want my experience to suffer because of it. The manager is to blame here. I saw him behind the bar a few times but not once did he come over to any of the tables to take responsibility for the shitstorm swirling around him. Anyway, enough about the service. It was abhorrent. Enough said.

The menu here is all over the map. They call themselves an Irish pub, a gastrohouse (cough) and a family restaurant. They have the obligatory Shepherd's Pie (made incorrectly with beef and not lamb like just about everyone else does) and fish and chips but tossed into the mix are things like fish tacos, pierogi, and chicken marsala. Saying this place has an identity crisis is like saying that Miley Cyrus has daddy issues. If you order chicken paprikash from this place you deserve what you get. We decided to keep it simple, soup and sandwiches:

Pear & Asiago Salad - The highlight of the meal and 90% of it was probably out of a bag. Mixed greens, sliced pear, raw walnuts, craisins, and shaved asiago cheese. The ingredients were decent enough, but the berry balsamic dressing was terrible - cloyingly sweet and overwhelming. It was like someone had mixed Smucker's strawberry jelly with balsamic vinegar and dosed it with corn syrup. It's only saving grace was that it was served on the side.

Potato Soup - Pretty basic offering that was forgettable and bland. Chunks of potato in a cream-base. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that this wasn't made in-house that day. It also had a strange sweetness to it that was off-putting.

Mad Reuben (turkey style) - The best part of this sandwich was the turkey. It was actually quite flavorful with a hint of smoke. The rest, including the greasy rye bread, sauerkraut with no personality and barely melted Swiss cheese, was just OK. The side of cole slaw was bland, lacking dressing and heavy-handed with the carroway seeds.

Turkey Club - According to the menu the turkey is \"herbed and roasted in house\". I thought it was a bit on the dry side and the rubbery vein I had to pull out didn't help matters. I did like the tomato chutney and the horseradish mustard was a nice spin but I couldn't really taste the bacon. The bread and cheese suffered the same fate as the Reuben. The side of thick-cut fries were greasy and unevenly cooked.

I don't know what else to say other than this was the perfect storm - terrible service, a menu that all three faces of Eve could appreciate, cheesy theme and forgettable bar food. Yet another one-night stand, I'm afraid.

BTW, remember the promise of the comped salad and drinks? I did get a free beer but we still got charged for the salad. I should have said something but I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Never have been here before and We went here on St Patrick's day and it was amazing! The wings were huge! My fiancé loves the wings! Can't wait to return on a regular day to check out the menu! Our server was amazing and she made sure we were taken care of! I love the fact that they said the wait was about 45 minutes but we only waited 20 mins!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to please a variety of tastes give Mavis a try. Creative salads and old school Cleveland style chicken paprikash just a few of the many choices. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Yearning for a genuine Friday fish fry, we tried out Mavis Winkle's.  I don't know why, but MW hasn't been on our \"usual\" list.  Maybe since it's basically an Irish pub, and we're usually going out with two kids in tow...

It will be on the list now.  We enjoyed the fish & fries, and the pierogies.  Yes, the Irish pub has pierogies, and they're good, very good, although they are mini-sized.  The star was the fish.  Perfect, golden-brown batter and flakey, moist fish.  This us what fried fish aspires to be.  The skin-on fries were also very good.  BTW, the fish dinner is buy one, get one during Lent, so a bargain too.  

I shouldn't have to mention, but will, that they'll put you a perfect pint of fresh Guiness as well.

They do often have a band or other entertainment on Fridays as well.  We enjoyed an Irish dance performance during our dinner.

Run, don't walk here.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Not so good...The chicken wings were crisp (good)...their award winning garlic sauce tasted a lot like butter with a hint of garlic powder to me.  I ended up dipping them in hot sauce too that was runny and lacking in flavor.

The fried fish, AWFUL...greasy, flavorless, just like the coleslaw. 

The best thing was the spinach and artichoke dip...too bad them dipped the tortilla chips in grease before serving them.

Beer a bit pricy and wasn't all that great...I should have known better...the place was DEAD on a Saturday evening...



Really enjoyed the Michael O'Mally Jackson Irish music...."}
{"text":"The new \"crispy\" potato pancake things with artichoke dip are not crispy at all, the dip was good. The \"crisps\" were too greasy. The pretzel bread is really good, but beware...they put too much sauce on the sandwiches and burgers, thus making a sticky meal."}
{"text":"Bar service is good. Draft beer is cheap but wine is about $6 a glass. Rueben is good and apps are good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Come here for happy hour food is great and employees r very friendly and the best part is coustermer service which is hard to find anymore"}
{"text":"Decent wings. Had the corned beef boxty and it's was actually good. Very poor service however"}
{"text":"1st of all I am biased when it comes to any Irish establishment... This place however didn't disappoint us... Excellent service ... food was very good and plentiful... atmosphere was comfortable... place was very clean... we had a few small nephews with us and the servers were excellent with the children... it's tucked away in a corner and not easy to find, but if you do, you will not be disappointed... Enjoy"}
{"text":"I am not sure what has happened to this place over the years. The menu seems to change all of the time. Service is hit or miss(usually a miss but we had good service this time around) but food is waaaaaaay overpriced. A corn beef sandwich with fries and a pop $13.50 before tip. The sandwich was very small(used to be larger) and fries were old and cold

Very very average anymore and it's a shame. Used to be a lot better"}
{"text":"This place is weirdly situated in an office building, but it was just a 1/2 mile from my hotel and I saw positive reviews. The menu is eclectic. It varies from traditional Irish fare like Shepherd's Pie, regular pub food and then...\"Sunflower seed Beet patty.\" Whaaaat? There is a a whole mini-menu of healthy options. I ordered the portabello Mushroom burger - which is ground portabello with Quinoa smushed in a patty on a wheat bun with red pepper hummus. It was OK. It wasn't mind blowing...but let me tell you what IS mindblowing: the Irish soda bread biscuits. In hindsight, my initial thought to steal them away in my purse for later was a better idea than simply NOT doing that. I guess I have never had amazingly prepared soda bread. It's usually really dry and bland. But these biscuits...Seriously. They are served warm and the exterior is hard and crunchy, and inside is melty-rich soft bread with just a bit of sweetness. I have never experienced anything like it...I guess the next best thing which is a distant 2nd would be the cheddar bay biscuits at red lobster.
So to sum up - menu is ok - it's not offensive. But it's not \"Melt Bar and Grilled-holy Lord-that's-amazing.\" But go for the biscuits. just...just do it."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant. We went on a Saturday and it was not very busy but they only had one waitress and some of the parties were a nice size. This led to slow but friendly service. I ordered the Fish and Chips. It wasn't terrible. On the greasy side but the coleslaw tasted spoiled. The Spinach Dip is great. I would go back just for that. If the had more staff, and not spoiled tasting coleslaw, I could see being our weekend lunch spot when we are out."}
{"text":"It was my first time being here.  I dragged some of my  friends with me and told them all about this yelp event.  I couldnt find where to check in though lol.

We got seats right at the bar and were pretty stoked on the drink specials they had. 2 dollar bud lights and 2 dollar shots from the shot girls.  The bartenders were super cool and were dressed in browns attire (whooo go browns).  I didn't get to try their food, but the food from the food trucks outside were awesome.  Wasn't a big fan of the taco truck though. 

The bistro trucks were good. I got some awesome Chili-mac n cheese, cupcakes, donuts, and a buffalo chicken sandwich.  The tacos were my least favorite though. Super bland no flavor tacos with under seasoned meat.

My experience here at Mavis Winkles was great though.  Atmosphere was mad fun along with a rowdy browns crowd.  Screaming and wooting as we go in for the touchdown with bells being rung in the background.  I would definitely consider coming back here for another browns game and would definitely give their food a whirl next time."}
{"text":"Ordered the food as take-away. The woman I spoke to was very accommodating and patient when she took my order. She even went to check on what types of beverages were available. When the ordered was delivered, I specifically asked if there was silverware in the bag and was told yes. There was no silverware or napkins provided. We were missing a drink as well as the extra tartar sauce I ordered. 

The food was okay. Seemed a lot like prepackaged meals like Applebee's. The Fish and Chips was the best part of the meal. The pasta dishes lacked a lot of flavor but I do understand it is hard to prepare take-away food as it is not the same at if you are eating in. If we are back in the area, this is not some place I would go to again."}
{"text":"For an Irish themed bar. The Wednesday wing special is to die for.  the bartender Lindsay is always helpful and fantastic good rotating draft menu"}
{"text":"Seems to be just average place now. For example, they used have pretty good fries but now seem like cheap WalMart fries. May not be going back."}
{"text":"The food selection is outstanding and so is the food. Service is spot on. I love this place."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and there are a few restaurant's that give me the WOW experience and Mavis Winkle's is one of those WOW experiences.  I was in the mood for wings but didn't want to go to the Winking Lizard.  I figured an Irish Pub had to have wings. These were some of the best wings I have ever had!  They were meaty and cooked to perfection.  Too many restaurants over cook the wings or the wings are too small.  Not at Mavis Winkle's.  

The other WOW factor is the number of regulars that were dining at the bar.  I don't just mean Clevelander's but the number of out-of-town business people like myself.  Erin is the bartender and she knew everyone and everyone knows her.  I struck up a conversation with a guy next to me from Cincinnati who eats at Mavis' Winkle's every time he is in Cleveland on business and that is a least twice a month.  That in itself says a lot.  

I am looking forward to my next visit to Cleveland and my visit to Mavis Winkle's.  If you go in, ask for Erin if she is working the bar.  If not, ask for the owners Bill and Mary Jo.  Tell them you read this review on Yelp and that Pete say hello!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was great. I got the Vegetable Boxty with Chicken and it was awesome. Will come back good environment for kids too."}
{"text":"Good bar food.  I got the steak, and it was both tasty and cooked correctly.  Nice bonus that it came with fresh asparagus rather than mushy, greasy veggies.  Beer was cold.  I should note that it was a Wed night, so there weren't too many people there.  I would definitely go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I didn't eat there. I went to meet some friends there and had a few drinks. I had a beer on tap and chatted most of the night. But I tell you what, our waitress was awesome. We were a big group on a weeknight and she took good care of us. I'll write more again once I return and try more of their food- by the way, their little beer shot is to DIE for (so says my friends)."}
{"text":"First time to visit here and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered the fish and chips. Half order had one piece of fish the full had two along with fries and coleslaw. Very tasty. My husband had the shepherd's pie. He wished it was warmer but didn't send it back. Very friendly staff. Prompt food delivery and beverages from the bar. Seasonal pumpkin with cinnamon and sugar rimmed glasses was very popular at our table. Tuesday is burger night. $2.00 off all burgers. Nice sized sandwich. I would good back!"}
{"text":"I got a sandwich from here and it wasn't even filled like normal sandwiches so I was not feeling it. The server was a sweetheart though!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really worth going to. If you grab something to eat try the corn beef and cabbage. Worth every bite."}
{"text":"Better than expected. There is a bar section that is more pub-looking and then the restaurant which is a little more brightly lit. Gooooooood shepherd's pie... but you can't really eff that up. Good salads and fish too. And the soup! On a snowy cold day, that soup was amazing."}
{"text":"Nothing awful to say, but no reason to run back here. 

It bills itself as an \"Irish Pub\" but ... is it really? Was the chicken paprikash Irish? Or the crab cakes? (note: the crab cakes were tasty, not best ever, but certainly hit the spot). I feel like every time I go there, I end up sitting next to people from a conference... but not one I was at. Lots of business people and then I feel like a slacker. The guy next to me said his burger was great, but the fries were gross. The salads are just okay. Next time I debate going here, I'll probably head to the Winking Lizard or Melt."}
{"text":"After 15 minutes of waiting we finally got a table.  5 minutes of being ignored.  5 minutes after they take our name and 5 minutes of 3 people talking to one dude about New Years Eve dinner.  Had I known who the hell the actual hostess was I woulda asked whats up.  Ordered a Chriatmas Ale (which the keg kicked) and then ordered at 12 Dogs instead.  A nice touch was she brought me the half glass of GLBC goodness from the kicked keg instead of just throwing it out.  Ordered a Greek salad and Greek pasta..not remotely Greek but both seemed somewhat healthier than all the fried, cheese covered stuff.  First off, the salad was literally 1.25 worth of Sysco veg and feta in a dish.  9 bux...what a deal.  The pasta was all Sysco, frozen shrimp and romas SWIMMING in butter and capers.  The menu never stated capers.  SOME PEOPLE DONT LIKE CAPERS.  They are the dingleberry of cuisine. Should'nt that be a responsiblity of the kitchen manager and owners to go over what goes in the food and that its actually listed on the menu???  Some people have food alergies too.  Said \"fresh basil\" as well..if there was \"fresh basil\" in there I will toss YOUR salad.  Also, when big red showed up late she ordered a quesadilla (I know shes apparently 5 years old) with NO chicken...guess what...there was so much chicken on here Colonel Sanders had a boner.  After we pointed all this to the server and sent half the butter caper monstrosity back we were STILL CHARGED for stuff that came out to us wrong.  Wow.  That takes balls.  Nollaig Shona Duit, Mavis..."}
{"text":"I wandered in on a cold evening expecting typical bar food...Wrong! The restaurant just happens to have a good bar but the food was AMAZING. The corned beef and cabbage was excellent, so excellent I came back the next day for the bangers and mash....another wise choice. The menu has so many appealing meals, I may not eat anywhere else for the two weeks I'm visiting Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I did not expect to be wowed by this place but what a pleasant surprise. I picked up a to-go order of their Guinness Onion soup and 6 Dry-rub Cajun wings. The hostess, Linda (I believe) was extremely sweet and my wings were ready within 15 minutes during the lunch rush. 

The soup was very good, although questionable if it is a true Guinness Onion soup because I couldn't detect a hint of flavor different from the norm. A little salty, even for French Onion, but still very tasty. The wings though!!! Oh the wings are phenomenal. 

The interior of the joint was cute enough and if you're biggest gripe with this place is that they're calling themselves an Irish pub but serving quesadillas, you probably need to loosen up. Who cares? The food is great."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have been satisfied with the food taste and portion size until today.  I ordered a half salad as I do elsewhere and often have a difficult time finishing it, but today's portion was disgracefully small.  The chicken in it was skimpy and tasteless.  The biscuits were burnt.  I should have complained and switched my choice, as the staff is very friendly and accommodating. I will return and hopefully have a better experience."}
{"text":"I've got to say I was impressed. I recently flew to Akron for a family wedding and my cousin took me to Mavis Winkles for my first night's meal. 

Atmosphere-wise it was perfect. There's lots of dark wood and Irish gewgaws. Service was friendly, helpful and unhurried. The menu was a combination of \"traditional\" Irish fare and other dishes with irish-y names. Celtic Calamari and Keiran's Quesadilla? Really? That I thought was a tad much. 

However, we decided to order off the more authentic part of the menu. We both started with a cup of potato soup and ordered the beer-battered fish and chips (in honor of our Bostonian grandfather). Everything was great, but HUGE. There was no hope at all of coming close to finishing! One item worth mentioning are the rolls. I was not a fan of the chives mixed in but, that aside, they tasted just like my grandfather's Irish soda bread! 

Also, should you attend during this holiday season, consider their drink of the month, mint chocolatini. Pretty good stuff!"}
{"text":"i would recommend skipping this place and going to another chain restaurant you are more familiar with. it's basically a Friday's but the food isn't as good."}
{"text":"Good beer and excellent food. I was not expecting the food to be as good as it is since it's an Irish pub. The service was prompt but not annoying. Our drinks and beer stayed full. The inside is Classic Irish pub. I would come here again. The portions were good size and prices average. Enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Their drink selections is decent, and their menu is okay.  Certainly not authentic Irish food, it's more like Americanized Irish food.  I'm a fan of the Shamrock Dip.  The atmosphere is casual and fun.  I really only came to this place when I happened to work for a business that was located several floors above it, though."}
{"text":"Service was poor.  Food was average.  Value was less than average. Place was clean, except for the bug in my drink (fruitfly)   Great location."}
{"text":"Came here while on a business trip. I like alcoholic ciders, and I can always get them at Irish restaurants.  Was disappointed that the didn't have any on-tap, so I ordered a Magners in the can (the only one they offered).  They were even out of that!  At an Irish Pub. I was very disappointed.  Food was mediocre."}
{"text":"No longer our \"go to\" pub. Many Irish dishes left the menu to make room for hipster gastro pub concoctions. Service has notably declined. They seat you where it is convenient for them, not you--such as 
putting a table of seniors in the same area of a bunch of out-of-control soccer children. Sad."}
{"text":"This is a classic and pretty cool little Irish pub.  Service is good, atmosphere is great, and food is a good quality and value.

No worries here.  Good to go."}
{"text":"Black and Tan with Guinness Onion soup, and Ruben spring rolls. Very good, good service, we would come back."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is phenomenal. Half price apps are always a winner right? We always order the chicken wings and reuban egg rolls. They are So crispy with just the right amount of corned beef. The food is always freshly prepared. I've never had old fries or cold anything. There is always a new beer on tap for my husband to try. Overall the environment is just professional, structured, and casual."}
{"text":"Pretty traditional Irish Pub.  The potato soup and biscuits are really good.  The corned beef is actually one of the best I've had in the area!

I would love to give them 5 stars but the service was so slow.  On a week night with a lighter crowd, it still took an hour and half to get served from start to finish.  I have no idea what my waitress what doing!"}
{"text":"As an Irish pub, I'd give this place 4 stars.  The atmosphere is classic pub, with a large selection of Irish and imported beers.  An interesting option was four 6.5 oz samplers for $8, I think.  I regrettably opted for a Guinness.  Bad move, it didn't taste very good.

The food was very average and is what dropped the fourth star.  I had fish and chips.  The fish was a bit mushy, the breading not very crisp, and the chips were fries, like all-American, thin-cut fries.  I'm used to the thicker cuts.  

The service was great.  Malt vinegar was supplied without asking.  

I could see this place is quite popular and understand why.  I'd keep it to drinks and some light fare.  It is convenient to I480."}
{"text":"What an awesome place!! They have a great happy hour, dinner menu, and a terrific staff. Our server Gina was great and Maura is the best!! She has an incredible personality and positive attitude. I went to Ireland in July and had Guinness for the first time. I've been to five places in Cleveland trying to find \"real\" Guinness and Mavis is the best!!!"}
{"text":"It makes me sad. This used to be a favorite restaurant. But the food is just OK. And the last two visits featured awful service. Messed up orders, long waits, cold food. This last time the beer was flat and warm."}
{"text":"Been to Mavis Winkle's a few times, including once on St Patrick's Day, and I think they've got their niche figured out.

The restaurant is good size, with a broken up layout.  The bar area is great at being a bar, but there's not a ton of space if it's crowded (like St Patrick's Day) nor is it good for viewing a TV.  

I will say that they have St Patrick's Day figured out.  They have a system for getting drinks, they have servers, and the food is fresh.  The other time I ate here, the corned beef was great, probably as good as Slymans.  Servers have been very attentive, and efficient.  What more do you want?  If I craved Irish food, beer, or whiskey more often, I'd probably frequent here."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long while, but only because it is far from where I live.  This is actually a really nice place with good food.  We had wonderful service, last we were here, but it is not kid friendly.  The tall table chairs make it difficult for children under 6 to sit on.  It's a pub, so treat it like one.  Otherwise, worth trying at least once!"}
{"text":"Friendly, attentive service was the highlight of my visit. I'm willing to give Mavis a second try because of it.

The place has a slightly unusual menu, not exactly what you might expect from a place that puts \"Irish\" in its name. Nothing fancy, but some unexpected choices.

I started with breaded zucchini. These were certainly not the usual frozen off-the-shelf appetizers. I got five long, thick wedges in light breading. The taste of the zukes probably came through much more strongly than the typical thin spears that are overpowered by the grease they're fried in. I say \"probably\" because the first bite singed the inside of my mouth (I literally had strips of my upper and lower palate coming off afterward). For all the heat, the zucchini was still very firm. I don't understand the physics of that. The zukes came with a dill dip which didn't have a deep enough dill flavor for me -- but, again, I was tastebud-impaired at this point.

(Should I have known better than to pop something this hot into my mouth? In my defense, a) The speed with which these were conveyed from kitchen to table was far above the norm; b) These are very thick wedges, so I couldn't just nibble -- i had to open my mouth wide to maneuver for a bite; c) the light outer breading must have cooled slightly, so I wasn't prepared for the intense heat that the zuke itself retained.)

My main was the Chicago-style Italian beef sandwich. (Like I said, the menu is unusual.) For something that's not the real thing, this was OK. The beef was suitably thin, but kind of dry, as if it had not been soaked in the juice for some time before serving. Indeed, the traditional herbed beef broth came on the side -- an affectation you'll never see in Chicago. Dipping was a problem because the beef just fell out, so I tried pouring to create the traditional \"wet\" style. Alas, the bun was not the proper slightly dry, absorbent roll; the juice mostly flowed away. Mavis does get points for the correct giardiniera (hot peppers and chopped veggies). 

Two tables next to me were filled with elderly ladies who seemed to enjoy the heck out of their clambake combos (a seasonal special) and drinks. (And their mock-flirty waiter.) Overall, this seems like a nice place. The prices are lower than you might expect. Next time, I'll approach things slightly more cautiously -- in both my choices from the menu and my approach to the first bites."}
{"text":"The fish and chips are alright.  I've probably had them 3-4 times.  We've stopped in here a few times while visiting OH for business.  The food and service are ok.  A few weeks ago the waitress dropped 10 of our orders on the floor, which was fun.  She came back minutes later with brand new entrees waiting for us.  They do have a fair amount of beer and we've never been around for the live music.  Whoever runs the jukebox does seem to have a weird obsession with the band Lighthouse though..."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun!
I went there for the Yelp Elite event and glad I was introduced to it. I love Irish pubs in general and Mavis didn't disappoint. 
Very friendly staff. The owner came and chatted with us for a bit.
We tried some of the food choices on the menu and everything was delicious. I especially loved the buffalo chicken dip, which I was told is new to the menu and I believe is on the appetizer portion.
The corned beef on top of the potato pancake was fantastic as well!
Am definitely planning on coming back. Even considering going there with kids for a family dinner sometimes."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the zucchini burger and steamed vegetables.  They are light on vegan choices but the do have a few and they do list what is vegan, vegetarian,  and gluten free which is helpful."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. It has vegetarian options so obviously, I'm a fan! Really good food, cute atmosphere... decent (but not cheap) pricing."}
