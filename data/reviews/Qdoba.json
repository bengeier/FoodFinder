{"text":"Food was just ok. The meat (chicken) was barely existent. Very little of it. I ordered a bowl. nothing really special about it. Chipotle is much better!

IT was my first time here. And the lady there was not helpful at all....I apologized several times because I had to ask about different ingredients. She was BARELY helpful. She just looked at me, when I asked what type of sauce something was.

Definiltely needs improvement in CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"Qdoba what happened!!!! You guys came to Cleveland After success in Mentor and did a great job. The food and customer service was fantastic when you first opened. Now you get sub par meat that has been held in a hot unit for who knows how long. Not that clean anymore. No more foot traffic and you have closed locations in the area. Please rethink your community presence because you have a great product going for you or shall I say had. I know I know I may be harsh but someone needs to wake up the owner and get this place thriving, yeah Chipotle has a strong following in EVERY community it touches but think about the other half they are not touching. People with tolerance to spices, Families, elderly that want to sit and watch that hanging tv of yours. Get it right or move along...."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and the food always comes out perfect. I've never had a bad experience here and will continue to choose Qdoba over Chipotle."}
{"text":"I do not like this food all that much.  Yet, like McDonald's, occasionally I feel a deep stirring in my soul that cries out for processed chain food.  And lo, this place delivers with the rich taste of Mexican food as passed through a homogenization factory.  

Okay, the truth is that the food is reasonably fresh, the beans are good, the meats are a cut above what you'd find at, say, Wendy's.  As far as national chain menus, this is pretty decent; sure, the menus are bog-standard, but having hot, fresh ingredients makes it all right even if the ingredients aren't melded so much as \"flung together into the same burrito.\"  And I do like it more than I do Chipotle's.  

It's decent.  But if you have any honesty in your soul, the food will be tainted with the tang of guilt for eating at some national chain restaurant when delicious Lebanese food like Saj is around the corner.  

But if you want Mexican, this isn't a bad choice.  Just a mass-produced one."}
{"text":"I prefer Qdoba and Moes over Chicraplay anyday.  I have been to this place many times.  People working are always good and fast.  They take coupons without giving me any crap.  Last time I was here the lady ringing me out dropped one of my items on the floor and proceeded to put it in my bag and hand it to me.  Normally, I would have went all Roamey Rome from Martin and flipped out but this time I kept my cool.  After I paid for the stuff that fell on the floor I took it home and threw it out.  Total waste of 12 bux.  Funny thing is, if you email corporate they don't even give you the decency of a response.  Good deal.  Looks like Ill drive the extra 10 minutes and go to Moes at Great Northern.  Rocky River creeps me out anyway.."}
{"text":"Okay, so the food isn't that good, but it's different.  When I'm in the mood for a fast burrito that isn't Chipotle...well, I guess this is the only other option.  

In any case, the options are fairly original, and they make some good sauces, such as the Queso, Ancho BBQ, and Poblano Pesto.  These sauces are what saves an otherwise pedestrian meal.

The employees at this particular location are particularly friendly and funny.  It's nice to see that from a fast food service worker."}
