{"text":"Have been to this restaurant a few times before with my family and this is the second time where we have experienced horrendous service. The waiter was very slow and spent most of their time chatting with customers rather than serving them. The food (normally decent) was overcooked and burnt. I was very disappointed from my experience at this restaurant. I thought I had found a local go-to restaurant but sadly I was mistaken. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just disappointing quality of food. Spent 35 dollars on nasty nachos and quesadillas. How do you mess up nachos!?"}
{"text":"Ok place.   Many Gluten free options, which is good for a bar!  They have Gluten free apps, salads, sandwiches, Pasta and a dessert. Not bad!!!  Over all food is fresh, friendly server(a little slow) with only 4 tables and 2 servers!   Tons of TV's around to watch water ever your heart desires(sorry sports only)!  For Bradford it's a good spot, if it was in To or Mississauga I would have dropped it to a 2 star rating because you expect more with a lot more competition around."}
{"text":"Absolutely great place for any occasion... Food is INCREDIBLY high quality for a \"sports bar\"... they have great bands here, and the service is amazing... Probably my fave restaurant in Bradford. ..   PRO TIP: Ask for \"Don's Ultimate Hot Sauce\"... it's not on the menu but it's the perfect mix of spicy and sweet..."}
