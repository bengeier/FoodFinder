{"text":"Awesome!   Great addition to the neighbourhood.  James (the owner) is so knowledgeable and will ensure that you have a fantastic dining experience. We have already been there twice and will definitely be regulars there.  There is nothing else like this in the area.  Ceviche is off the hook!!!!"}

{"text":"What a beautiful place to have dinner with the ladies. An upscale restaurany with food that definitely appeased the taste buds. The server was very helpful in answering any questions we had on the food choices. Plan to come back for their oyster night."}
{"text":"Celestin of the same location has morphed into a  Peruvian tapas restaurant. It has the same owner and chef as in its previous incarnation.

Overall the quality is good and interesting, portions are small.

The ceviche is not too acid, the fish soft and an added touch of big grains of corn crunchy.
The avocado and tomato salad is beautifully presented. Furthermore, the aspic in which it sits is fragrant and sweet.
The pork belly was spicy and delightful.
The scallops were purple and gingery, different from the ceviche, with a cherry flavour.
The sole was excellent, and plentiful; the accompaniments were slightly weird.
The octopus was well-prepared and very rich, slightly spicy.
The chicken anticucho was a disappointment being unremarkable and very small.

The wine list is apparently having a makeover, but we found a perfectly acceptable Sauvignon for just over $40. (They now offer Pisco Sours).

There is a pleasant patio, but otherwise the decor doesn't seem to have changed much from its French origins of Celestin. 

The service is friendly and intelligent."}
