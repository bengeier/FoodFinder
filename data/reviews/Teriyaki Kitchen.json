{"text":"Great food! Great prices! Awesome environment. Looking out the window at Guadalupe Road almost makes you feel like you're at a diner in Tokyo.I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Reasonable prices. Nice lady at the counter. Decent environment.  The only thing is the restroom needed attention."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place driving home. Decided to just give it a chance. Good priced food, you'll get your fill. Exactly what you'd expect for a smaller teriyaki house. We did order teriyaki sauce twice and got soy sauce instead so that's weird. It was good, I'm satisfied. If you've got $8 and want a nice plate of food definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on all the raving reviews and thought I would place an honest review of the teriyaki chicken- it was not very good at all. Requested to add vegetables and had to order a separate small side. Ordered the white chicken and it seemed all of it was dark meat. It probably would have been just okay but they put way too much teriyaki sauce that made it really inedible. I ordered an egg roll and it was super crunchy inside like it wasn't cooked and then I found this weird piece of something in it that was white and stretchy looked fresh mozzarella- yuk yuk. Im guessing they probably don't have fresh mozzarella at a Japanese place so who knows what this is. I hope it was something food grade at least. I didn't much of either thing ordered so it was basically a waste. I don't know how this place gets such good reviews when the most basic thing they make is not very good."}
{"text":"Been going here off and on for many years. This isn't as close to home as it once was, so before today it had been a long time since my last visit. Can't believe how consistently good their teriyaki chicken is!!! If you're looking for healthy options you can get white meat & brown rice; plus they have other low carb options (haven't tried them but they're available).  5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"This place is on point! I give it 5 stars for some simple yet great reasons:

-Food comes out fast and fresh!
-It's not pricey.
-the chicken teriyaki is so good, I get the large which comes with enough rice and chicken that I can't finish (I'm 6ft, 275lbs).

All around good flavor and plenty of food, much better then a Panda Express or other fast chain. 

Great ppl working there that are friendly and helpful. 

Go in there, nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"It's local, convenient, delicious, and affordable Japanese food. The udon soup is wonderful and it is possibly the cleanest restaurant I've ever been in. They also will customize the order for you, such as going light on the sauce.

If you want casual, unpretentious Japanese food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Love the chicken teriyaki! Great quality of chicken and large portions when you get the box!"}
{"text":"This is a Tasty spot.  Very affordable prices and good food.  Quaint and quiet and friendly staff.  Big portions.  Huge Menu and freshly cooked.  Give it a bit to cool off though cause it is piping hot."}
{"text":"The Happy Family has owned and operated this wonderfully consistent casual Japanese eatery for 23 years.
Clean, friendly and most of all, the food is made to order and is delicious!
Very neat indoor dining area with a very long \"group\" table in the center of the room.  There is also a separate dining area and a very cool jungle patio also available.
The menu is diverse and has a lot to choose from."}
{"text":"This was the BEST!! Food and Service- VERY VERY clean and nicest people ever. 
Cannot wait to eat here again! If you are in the area you will not be disappointed. Ditto on the crab puff's"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the Tempe/Mesa area so far!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good. I can't believe more people have not discover this place.  Food is great,  but the price is even better."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite local restaurants in Chandler. They have a large menu and everything is authentic and delicious. I personally am addicted to the vegetable yakisoba it's one of the best in the valley."}
{"text":"This place has a 26 year old tree growing inside. Wings are amazing. Orange chicken is amazing. Family loved dinner. Thank You Peter!"}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken was good but the yakisoba noodles with beef was very disappointing! It was salty to greasy I also ask for a regular bowl and they gave me rice on the bottom of my noodle bowel.. I don't know if that is normal.. But I was surprise at the cutting of cornors.. I will try it again with an updated review because the chicken was good.."}
{"text":"This place is great to have lunch, etc.
The food is amazing.
The atmosphere outside in their custom made \"forest\" is a great place to calm down and relax."}
{"text":"Great place.  Nice little patio retreat just outside the door by the pick up area.  Food was delicious.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We were in the vicinity around dinner & I checked yelp for reviews. With a 4 star review I thought there is no going wrong! Well... we didn't like it much. Tried the teriyaki chicken & house chicken bowl. The Oishi or Sarku @the mall are far far better. I guess tastes differ a lot & there are obviously people who like this place. Ambiance is funky, a little tacky but cute. Food is inexpensive, so can't complain as long as you don't hurt your tummy."}
{"text":"Looks can certainly be deceiving. From the outside this establishment doesn't seem like much, but once inside you'll find a very relaxing and comfortable ambiance. The food is absolutely delicious and affordably priced. It's one of my favorite places to grab a quick bite in Mesa. The Sakura noodles are amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today. Had the teriyaki chicken. Chicken was very good. Not cheap gristly meat you sometimes find. Service was very good as well. I didn't have a soda, but I noticed they charge 33 cents to refill a small and more to refill a large. Pretty annoying to have to pay for a refill. Not the price, but the principle of it. This is why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"First time here. Got the Phoenix chicken bento which is their version of kung pao. It comes with teriyaki chicken, soup, salad,
Rice, egg roll and crab wonton for 9.75

I didn't find the teriyaki to sugary which is great. Good portions, good and fast service, good prices and I thought overall above average and appeared clean. 

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food and perfect atmosphere. Very relaxing ! It would make it much better if they had decent hot mustard and sweet and sour verse the poor quality generic kind that comes in a package.  I would recommend the dine in experience"}
{"text":"Casual, affordable, family-owned fast-food restaurant with mostly Japanese food, but some Chinese selections.  As far as fast food goes, this place rocks.  The food is consistently good, the staff is friendly and it's very affordable to eat here.  There's plenty of parking, indoor and outdoor seating and the place is really clean.  What's on the menu?  Teriyaki chicken, katsu bowls, fried rice, california rolls, mongolian beef to name a few of my favorites.  They are really accomodating here as well.  You can ask for spicy, extra spicy, not spicy at all...white meat chicken, dark meat chicken."}
{"text":"Been coming to Teriyaki Kitchen as long as I could remember. I moved down to Tucson for college 5 years ago and I still drive up every so often just for their Tokyo Chicken. Everything is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Yummo!!!! Went there today with the whole family.  The Bento box with teriyaki chicken was great.  Then the owner suggested the house chicken.....yummy, yummy!  The bento box comes with one egg roll, crab puff, rice and the chicken...Wait it doesn't stop there!  A salad and a house soup was also included.  Will be going back.....We need more Mom and Pop kitchen like this...No frills just great food!"}
{"text":"Small neighborhood restaurant with a big menu and with big tastes. The staff is always friendly and fast and the food is consistently tasty. No matter what you order you won't be disappointed. Recommend stopping in if your in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great 'mom & pop' spot.  I always come here and I've never had a bad experience. 

The place looks to be an old Filiberto's building but the inside is really nice.  The plants, decor, music, and the sound of running water from a little fountain makes this place very relaxing and comforting. 

I've tried a few different things on the menu and while not everything is great, the teriyaki chicken is on point. Never fails me. Plus the owners are always nice.  This is one of those places that I default to when I can't decide on where to have my lunch."}
{"text":"Only so so. Somewhat overpriced for cheap Chinese. Crab puffs very good however. I found the complete over reliance on teriyaki to be somewhat underwhelming. No good for large groups unless you like bench seating."}
{"text":"Fresh and wholesome food. Good value. Decent price. The owners take pride in providing a clean, relaxing, welcoming environment and good food. It's a hidden gem. Will come back."}
{"text":"I used to come here weekly when I lived down the street about 20 years ago. It was really good and the price was like less than $5 for the teriyaki all white chicken bowl. I was in the area today just after 4pm with my son. He was starving after work so I ran in to get an order to go. I was the only customer at the time and I literally waited 15 min for my order since \"white meat\" takes a little longer. I got my order ran out to the car, my son and I each took bite. I should have known it didn't look right from the beginning as there were no char grilled marks on the meat. I was so hungry that I swallowed my bite and my son spit his out. The meat was chewy and raw. After looking at it again, I noticed it was pink and not cooked well.
I went back in and told them and just asked for my money back. I dont know what happened to this place but I will not return again. I hope I dont get sick."}
{"text":"My friends and I found this place so randomly on yelp and it was so tastey that we keep coming back. This is the third time I've been here this month!  The bento box keeps bringing us back here!!  I love their yakisoba too!!! 

The decor is so beautiful and there are seats that are tucked away if you want some privacy and even an outdoor patio!!! 
Not expensive and worth the drive from where you are ! 

I really wish I could give them more stars!"}
{"text":"Much more inviting on the inside than the outside so don't let its outer appearance fool you. very green, very cool with pretty fountains and relaxing music abound. What really matters of course is the food so fresh, great tasting and made-to-order."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant and they are all very kind and helpful. Food is very fresh and tasty, although their chicken dishes are far superior to their beef entrees. Definitely get the bento box if you are hungry, you get salad, soup, egg roll, crab wonton, their famous teriyaki chicken and another entree all for usually under $9...what a deal!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place for a date.  The food is really fresh, really good.  All the gold awards from their latest health inspections proudly displayed for all to see.
Great menu selections and very reasonable prices.

We took our meal out to their patio which is more closely described as a small enclosed Japanese Friendship garden. There's a trickling fountain, wind chimes and lots of plants and various decorations from Asia

I would whole-heartedly recommend this restaurant for not only a nice place for a date, but it also serves well for families and caters to larger crowds.

Great food, great service and friendly staff = 5 stars!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get Japanese food at!! Definitely recommend their teriyaki chicken, it's my favorite thing on the menu. + the place has really a really great atmosphere and such good vibes! Love it."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Kitchen provides a wonderful, relaxing dine - in experience wi th great tasting, decent priced meals. I love how the employees are so nice and keep the place so clean. The little garden area is my favorite:) the place offers a wide array of bowls that you can choose from. My personal favorite is the Chicken and veggies, veggies are cooked just right. Anyways, this is such a great spot for lunch and quick bites!"}
{"text":"I decided on ordering the chicken teriyaki bento which seems to be a very popular option here. While the chicken teriyaki was actually quite good, they unfortunately put way too much sauce on there to the point where the sauce just overpowered everything else that I had. Everything else was decent and I would have liked the chicken teriyaki much more if there was less sauce. I would probably ask for the sauce to be put on the side next time so I can control how much is on there.

The atmosphere inside is also kind of weird as well. It's supposed to be relaxing but given the location and ambiance of the restaurant inside it was just a bit strange. I also didn't really like some of the tacky signs in the restaurant too that remind people to look out for their children. Either way it doesn't really matter to me as I am just getting take-out food."}
{"text":"Better than our usual asian take-out. We love their teriyaki chicken and sweet & sour chicken. My husband likes their side salad, has very crisp lettuce with a nice light dressing. The bento box is a great price for what you get."}
{"text":"Dropped in by off chance when we were out and about and sure was glad I did. The place has a unique fusion of japan and ikea for decoration. The food was just great. My wife had curry chicken and i chose the bento box with lemon chicken and teriyaki chicken. Everything was just amazing. If you are in the are I would definatly recomnend."}
{"text":"I eat here a couple times a month. We always get one of the same few items and it's always good. The Orange Chicken is amazing. Garlic Chicken extra spicy is the usual. Always friendly."}
{"text":"Another a+ mom and pop place, the owners are so cute! They are super nice and offered water to me when I was waiting for my food.

The teriyaki chicken was really good, so good I thought I needed to write a review while I ate. I love that there's tons of chicken and tons of great teriyaki sauce. The price is good too."}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken is amazing! Fried rice is also good! I don't particularly like the noodle dishes and the sweet and sour chicken was ok - that's all I've tried so far - but the teriyaki chicken is so phenomenal I plan on coming back forever."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem! I found it on yelp since I was craving a teriyaki bowl. The food is pretty yummy and the environment/decor is quite relaxing. I felt at home and the lady working at the register was very nice."}
{"text":"For what this is, it's really good! A \"fast\" food place for Asian fusion food. The environment is soothing, not something you'd expect. I love that there are plants everywhere. You can choose a table to dine alone, or a table to share with some new friends. I enjoyed our choices as much as any other Asian place that makes good food.Not a bad choice if you're in Chandler/Mesa! It isn't a place you get waiter service, but that's fine if you aren't expecting that."}
{"text":"Best teriyaki chicken I have had in a very long time.   
First time here in years.  I don't remember it being this good before."}
{"text":"If your a foodie you can go ahead and cross this joint offer your list ... and I had such such high hopes for this place! 

Yup, cute little take out joint with potted plants everywhere and a friendly Chinese couple behind the counter ... just as my friend described. With the nice walk up experience I fully expected one of them to start cooking my order hot and fresh right in front of me. Unfortunately it's more of same low grade americanized oriental food you find everywhere emanating from a small slot in a wall cooked by god knows who. 

After 14 years in the valley you'd think I'd give up the hunt, but hey I once did find China King which keeps my hope's alive. Unfortunately it was shut down after 3 short years, perhaps proper tasty Chinese food cannot exist within the state health guidelines. 

My search continues ..."}
{"text":"I love the food here and that it's served hot.  I wouldn't say it's \"date night\" exactly, but it's definitely TASTY lunch food or quick pick up for dinner if you're in that neighborhood.  I wonder if it is owned by a family, because the same people are there year after year.  I have only one minor complaint, and that is being nickel and dimed to death... if you want a teeny tiny cup of teriyaki sauce, there's a charge.  If you want a refill on your soda, there's a charge.  I'd kind of rather have them add a buck to everything and just act normal."}
{"text":"The best rice bowl restaurant I have ever been to! I have been coming to this place for 20 years now, and not only has the quality of the food stayed at the top of its class, but the mom & pop run employees are friendly and efficient. Great alternative to traditional fast food.

Only thing Ive never understood: ever since I was 4 years old, in coming here, I have never seen more than 2 other people in the restaurant. I have no idea how they have kept their doors open like that, but I suppose Im going to have to file that under \"don't know, don't care.\""}
{"text":"I really like the food here. I highly recommend the shrimp & vegetable stir fry. Delicious. I also love their Sumai, it's more of a sweet & savory flavor than some of the others I've tasted (most Sumai I have tried tends to be too heavily spiced for my taste... not at teriyaki kitchen). Also give the Udon soup a try.

I could go on. Gotta stop somewhere. 

Hands down I'll always visit Teriyaki Kitchen over an American-Chinese fast food place every time. Fresh vegetables, prepared to order, more traditional."}
{"text":"This place is rated high for many reasons previously stated in other reviews, and rightly so, but let me add one more. The service I experienced today was a mixture of patience and courtesy. The front staff were very much professional in having to wait on me to finally pick my selection amidst all there was to offer. I will visit this place more frequently in the future."}
{"text":"2 star for the food & +1 for the service

I love Mom & Pop places but along with the great reviews I decided to give Teriyaki Kitchen a try.  This restaurant was pretty easy to find since it's a stand alone building.  Inside is dated with a 80's feel but parts of the dining room with updated with some modern Ikea type furniture.

As for the food, I really think it's over priced Japanese / Chinese fast food and not really that good.  

Teriyaki chicken rice bowl (2*) - dried chicken w/ mediocre sauce
BBQ  Ribs rice plate - (1.5*) chewy & dry

If you like the Kyoto Bowl kind of food, this place may work for you."}
{"text":"Best teriyaki in Phoenix this place is awesome it has a huge menu and its all good. Peter the owner is so nice. Not to mention they are clean and on the deans list for and a+ cleanliness. Clean and delicious is a hard combo to find these days"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place for years and always told myself I would try it.  The menu says they have been there for 26 years!  Their parking lot always appeared busy, a good sign I thought. It is smaller inside than I imagined but decorated with lots of plants and greenery and different kinds of tables.  You will eat out of white foam take out boxes, ordering at the back, with plastic utensils and little envelopes of sweet and sour sauce, and hot mustard.  You can pick up salt and pepper shakers and small bottles of soy sauce also in the back.  The shakers were very sticky, you had to wipe your hand with a napkin after touching them, a star came off immediately.  The oriental woman who took my order was friendly  and patient.  I ordered 2 egg rolls, a large Phoenix Chicken, all white meat, with peanuts and mixed vegetables, lots of tender chicken breast but not any real flavor to speak of.  I also ordered  Tonkatsu (deep fried  pork cutlet all cut up with spicy sauce that was not spicy, with two large scoops of white rice and a small green salad.  I must say the salad was the best part of the meal, crisp chopped lettuce, celery and onion in a tasty sweet sesame dressing. A small cup of egg flower soup also accompanied the meal.  It needed lots of salt and pepper and soy sauce to give it some flavor.  I wished for more taste but everything was flat and mild.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes, we were more than disappointed!  Spent $26+ and left very unsatisfied."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this restaurant for a long time and have never had a bad meal.
Always friendly people, of course my wife and I have our favorites, but every once in a while we change it out and the new choices are really good too."}
{"text":"I love coming here during my lunch! Great teriyaki chicken or tofu lunch special. And the owner is the sweestet and always remembers my preference to tofu over chicken. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A friend at work got this for lunch months ago and I have been wanting to try it. I finally made it there and it was NOT a let down!!! LOVED IT!!!! I just got the white meat teriyaki chicken and it was DELICIOUS!!!!!! I shared it with my daughter and the large fed both of us no problem. I can't wait to go back!!!! Probably the BEST I have ever had!! Definitely 5 stars! The service was great, prices were great and very inviting atmosphere!! :-))"}
{"text":"The best quick service Japanese food anywhere!  The teriyaki chicken is to die for, and their veggies are always good with big mushrooms. Great atmosphere and prices, this has been a favorite of mine for over ten years.  Very friendly staff, which keeps us coming back as well.  My wife and I drive across the valley to come here, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"My rating is strictly for the food. It was dry, over cooked, lacking flavor. I got it as takeout for my family and we were all disappointed. We had the orange chicken and teriyaki chicken. Both ended up getting tossed. The owner is amazing though. Very friendly, hospitable and kind. I had a great conversation with him while I waited for my takeout."}
{"text":"This place is very unique. It has plants everywhere inside and there is soft music playing. The food is freshly made and worth the wait."}
{"text":"J and I went a couple days ago for a quick lunch. i thought it was going to be GREAT based on the four star reviews. I got Teriyaki white meat chicken and he got the garlic chicken. mine wasn't all that great but his came with the water chestnuts and mushrooms and it was goooooood! it's served over white rice so don't be intimidated by the menu when it doesn't say that. don't get the fried rice, you're gonna get enough with your dish (unless you get the yakisoba which is noodles) and it wasn't worth it IN OUR OPINION. very serene atmosphere though."}
{"text":"My daughter and I, plus my two year old grandson, came here for dinner tonight.  We were across the street at the Goodwill after picking him up at his children's center and scrapped our plan to go to Arizona Mills because it was getting late and came here instead.  I recognized the place when we walked in and remembered coming here several years ago with my mother and husband and had good food.  Tonight was no disappointment.  

The owners couldn't have been more patient regarding our tired, noisy toddler, and to them I apologize.  Our food was excellent, flavorful and not overly salty as some teriyaki can be.  The salad and soup were especially enjoyable.  I'm not a big eggroll fan but theirs were really good and the crab puff was one of the best I'd ever eaten.

I look forward to  coming back here, hopefully this trip but definitely anytime I'm in town, and perhaps without the tired child next time so I can relax and enjoy a little more and not chase away other customers."}
{"text":"For the past couple of years my son has been telling me I need to try Teriyaki Kitchen, I was hanging out at his place and he said mom lets to lunch my treat, and so off we went.

I went with a chicken teriyaki bowl; it had the perfect amount of rice, chicken and sauce. The chicken was tender and full of that teriyaki flavor. I don't even know why it took me so long to try them out. I have been craving a good teriyaki bowl and now I have the place that makes them!

The restaurant on the inside is clean with lots of plants around. Service is friendly.  I am glad my son never gave up on getting me to try them and I know I will be back often!"}
{"text":"Fast food place I saw while driving back to the hotel. They had too many kinds of beef dishes in that I had to ask and the counter person did not know. I ordered the sukiyaki bowl. It was basically stir fried beef with napa cabbage and onions with some tofu. The sauce was a little thick but had pretty good flavor. The thing I did not like was the texture of the beef, it seemed rubbery. If I ever ordered it again, I would say no beef."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Teriyaki Kitchen. The food is good and the staff is nice. I also like the atmosphere of the restaurant. The teriyaki chicken is delicious. I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken was nothing special. Curry chicken just wasn't good.

California rolls were huge. Almost too big really.

Maybe it was an off day, but I just wasn't really impressed. Won't be coming back here again.

However, decor was really nice, and the service was top notch as well :D"}
{"text":"My husband,  son, and I were out and about when we realized we were all hungry.  We happened upon this little mom and pop place and decided to give it a try.
   My husband and I both got the Bento Combo. He got lemon chicken and I opted for the curry chicken.  For about $9 you get teriyaki chicken, another entrée,  an eggroll, salad, crab puff, and soup.
   The teriyaki chicken was excellent. The meat was tender and the sauce was delicious.  My husband's lemon chicken was amazing! I wanted to keep stealing bites. Their curry chicken is just right. Not overwhelmingly spicy, seasonings just right. This was my 1 year old's favorite dish.
   The soup and salad were nice and the eggroll was pretty good too. My husband enjoyed the crab puffs.
   The restaurant is nicely decorated and the woman working the front was very sweet. 
   My only gripe was having to pay 35 cents if I wanted to refill my small soda.
   We'll definitely be back if we find ourselves in the area."}
{"text":"Great quick food! Family is always there making great food. Homemade teriyaki sauce is awesome. Try the Phoenix chicken for a little spice."}
{"text":"Love this place! So friendly and absolutely LOVE the patio!  The place is family owned for 26 years- and the owner is so friendly and accommodating. I felt more like a son than a customer. Will definitely be Back!!"}
{"text":"Relaxing atmosphere, beautiful interior and serene background music. The food is delicious, I just wish they'd be more light with the sauce. Props to the chef singing in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Coming from the Northwest (Portland), I can be a bit of a Bento/Teriyaki snob.  We moved here almost 4 years ago and I think I finally found my bento joint.  This business has been around for 25 years, which you'll see why, in the friendly owners, customer service and amazing food.  Go with the sweet tasting chicken teriyaki and a miso soup.  Love this place!!!

The best Bento/Teriyaki in Arizona by far."}
{"text":"Love this place, friendly and nice people work and own this place. Call ins are welcome which makes it easy to swing by on the way home. Inside is always clean and picked up!"}
{"text":"I use to like this place until I got the usual teriyaki bowl and I noticed I couldn't swallow a piece of chicken.... It was connected to another piece. When I pulled it out my checked was connected by a piece of hair. I was mortified I will never be coming here again. Also their California rolls are too much rice and too little ingredients."}
{"text":"For authentic exceptional Japanese Cuisine, this is a great place.  I love the Mom and Pop feel of the place and the family that owns it are the sweetest people.  All the dishes were tasty, even the side salad had this incredible cinnamon dressing.  Plan to make this a regular spot.  No surprise that this place has been here for 18 years! Trust me... I am asian.  This is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"My chicken was so plain. I was upset with it. It was just teriyaki chicken. Hard to mess up. I doubt ill be back. It is a relaxing place tho. Just dont go for the food."}
{"text":"Really good food! I love sitting in their outdoor patio area on the side; it's like a little hidden gem! My favorite is their beef yakisoba. We frequent here at least once a month!"}
{"text":"Went here because the reviews were soooo great and I was craving teriyaki and wanted something other than yogis.  I got a chicken teriyaki plate. Long story short I don't like not having the option to do half brown rice and half veggies. I also didn't like that they literally give you what seems like 2 cups of sauce on the plate. The sauce was wayyyyy too heavy. Literally in some spots it was chunky as of it didn't get heated through. Some people may like that but it was a huge turn off for me. I'll continue to go to yogis from now on! I tried but was disappointed in the end."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years, since I was a kid actually, and know the owners.  They are nice, hardworking folks that strive to make the best quality meal for you.  Think Kyoto bowl, but with better portions and more selection.  Everything is fresh and flavorful, with very reasonable prices.  My favorites to get here are the katsu bowl and the house chicken.  So if you are in the mood for fast-food Japanese/Chinese, Teriyaki Kitchen is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"I grew up down the road and have always wanted to try it. Who doesn't love a good teriyaki chicken bowl. Of course we ordered some crab puffs. They LOOKED amazing. Although we never got to try them. Our order was to go and it was missing the crab puffs.. after letting the disappointment set in I tried the chicken and .... I was hoping for more flavor. Not sure if I just had a bad experience or if this is pretty common? Guess I'll never know."}
{"text":"This is my go-to teriyaki bowl place. The family owned staff is great and make yummy meals. Crab puffs and egg rolls are really good and I have not had a bad meal from the several bowls I've ordered. I like the calming, peaceful dining area inside and out. Nice authentic feel."}
{"text":"This place is terrific!  Their teriyaki chicken is really good and their fried rice is as well.  I love the decor inside also they've done a great job.  I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"This place is really great! Its like a hidden treasure. Their teriyaki chicken is perfection. They soups arent the best though. I really love the little garden area(:"}
{"text":"I got a nice little Bento Box where all boxes come with teriyaki chicken, soup, salad, spring roll, crab puff, rice and your choice of another entree. A lot for $10. It was all Delish.

The teriyaki chicken reminded me of the mall teriyaki chicken back in Indy. Tender and juicy and sweet."}
{"text":"Realizing I wrote a review for Magic Wok under Teriyaki Kitchen, I wanted to say a few quick words about this place before my accidental review is read by too many people.

This is an old-school place. The food is pretty good, the prices decent, and it is close by. It is the sort of place that I can see using for carry-out from time to time. Service was decent, and it is a clean place, though nothing fancy.

I had Sukiyaki, and it was okay. My wife, however, had the katsu chicken and it was really great. I plan to go back and try some of their other dishes and update the review as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is good, portions are right on and the pricing isn't bad. I usually stop for take out but the seating area inside is also pretty nice. The staff is always friendly and makes my order really quickly."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Chicken at the Teriyaki Kitchen
Bento boxes! 
With all the damn fixins.
Teriyaki Kitchen. Get the Teriyaki Chicken
Good shit man.
This place is damn bitchin."}
{"text":"Hands down 5 stars, did not even need to think twice about it. (this does not happen often).

Ginormous menu and low prices. We had spare ribs, orange chicken, rice and our meals also came with egg drop soup AND salad and we also got two orders of crab puffs  all for $20 freakin bucks.  

everything was deeeelicious. i mean everything. nothing but silence as we ate. 

The man working while we were there was just a delight, he was helpful, nice( some kid(who was clearly under the influence of something) told this poor guy his whole life story, let him use the restaurant phone and changed out $11 in change to give him dollar bills) and funny(he just had this grin on his face the whole time the kid was telling him his problems) hahahah... it was def entertainment while eating.

Also i love that it is like a fast food kind of joint, but the decor inside does not represent that.

i highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were out for something new and wanted some sort of Asian food and happened along this place.  We weren't sure at first because it was empty.  Don't be fooled as soon as we ordered people were milling in and out of the place the whole time we were there.  The food was great.  My only gripe if any was that I asked if he had mild curry and he said it was.  Either a communication barrier or he misunderstood me, but that curry knocked my socks off lol.  I enjoyed the food and the managers were very friendly and from my home state of WA when the immigrated.  My little gripe wasn't enough to take a start away - try this little place out - they are sweet and the food was worth it!  Had the Curry/Teriyaki Bento and I loved it."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE HAS BADASS FOOD!!!!
The chicken and broccoli & 
the white meat chicken Teriyaki &
orange chicken
are the 3 things that will never let you down.
I've been eating here since 2007
and I have never had any problems. 
there service is fast and friendly.
I will always recommended Teriyaki Kitchen to anyone that wants fast well made food."}
{"text":"Best Asian food in the area. I love how it is right by my house! Their teriyaki sauce is my favorite, just perfect. Miso soup, vegetable soup, veggie egg rolls, teriyaki vegetables....some of my favorites and all amazing! Great Asian restaurant for vegetarians as well. And the workers are always very nice! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is true authentic Teriyaki Japanese food.  You can order a bowl, medium plate, or bento.  I went with the bento because you can order another dish and then get a little bit of teriyaki chicken.  Another great thing, is that they do white meat chicken for another addition $1.  The only negative about this is it seems like their A/C was not running that fully.  That is why I went from 5 to 4 star.  They keep the windows blinds open, so its really warm near the windows.  The window area is where they have tables."}
{"text":"Love it! I usually order to go the chicken teriyaki and all chow mein noodles and it's delicious every time. Definitely hits the spot if you're looking for good teriyaki! I've tried other stuff on their menu and everything I've tried is pretty good."}
