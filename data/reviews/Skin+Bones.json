{"text":"Creative cooking. Modern cool joint with pleasant staff.   Loved the soft small gnocchi with 'nduja- though I found only a tiny morsel of this delicacy in the savoury sauce- and my friend enjoyed the Ontario perch which is difficult to cook well. Asparagus side imaginatively broiled and seasoned, al dente very yummy.  Overall very good food and a fresh approach though 25% overpriced on many items , the perpetual problem of focusing on decor that costs $$$ to build in.  Give it a try, I will return despite the cost issue."}
{"text":"Had the chef's tasting menu for $38 per person between 2 people and it was just the right amount of food. We loved that we got to try a few different plates off the menu. Our favourite was the pork steak but we also liked the prosciutto croquettes and the gnocchi. Our least favourite was the escarole & persimmon salad as we weren't a fan of the yoghurt dressing. For cocktails, I really enjoyed the maple glazed bourbon sour and the negroni was made really well. We will definitely be back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I cannot express how incredible our dining experience was at Skin+Bones.  We arrived on a Friday evening with no reservations ( it was a last minute get together) and were received with a friendly and warm reception.   Our waiter Adrian went above and beyond to make our evening special.  The food was exceptional."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now, for the most part it has been a hit! The first night I went with a girlfriend, we sat at the bar. This was a surprisingly comfortable and intimate space! They served us the most delicious sourdough bread which my friend and I still talk about (but they haven't had it since? Or maybe it's just a thing at the bar - I haven't sat at the bar since). I had a few coffees, which were very tasty as well. Their pork and ricotta meatballs on soft polenta is my new comfort food. I've had it the last couple times I went, and I'm working on my own imitation at home. Some of their meals seem to be needlessly complicated when their excellent ingredients can speak for themselves. More specifically the Atlantic cod main dish... there's way too much going on, and when you already have capers AND chorizo in a dish, please go light in the salt!  I will most definitely return again and again, the staff is very friendly, their food is good, and the ambiance is cozy and romantic. I love this strip of queen street!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Skin+Bones for the first time and had a good overall experience. The restaurant is nice and spacious.  We started off with a flight of California wines and Dark and Stormy Sangria. The wines were all very nice. Unfortunately the Dark and Stormy Sangria seemed like a drink that I would attempt to make and then never make again and I love a good Dark and Stormy.  This is not a small plate restaurant, but we ordered three appetizers/bar food to share to start and they oddly arrived all at the same time, which took away from each dish.  Osyters - Good Malpeque oysters, was hoping for something a little nicer then basic mignonette.  Steak Tartare - Delicious. Fresh, nicely chopped and served with house made chips. Would recommend.   Charcuterie Platter - This was a let down, was expecting a lot more for the price. Duck prosciutto and two similar cured meats with garish and jelly mustard. Not impressive.  We ordered two beers, can't remember, but good and two more bar food/apps to share.  Mackerel and Fried Gnocchi - This dish was great. Great tasting mackerel (cured I think) with nice fried gnocchi (Entoca Sociale vibe) . Would recommend.   Bone Marrow - This was the biggest let down. Love making and ordering bone marrow canoes. Never mind sharing this, it was not even enough for one person. Only enough for one bite. Don't order this, we saw another table with it and it looked the same.   Sticky Toffee - Very good sticky toffee pudding. Cannot recall what was cooked inside it, but delicious dish that we cleaned the plate off pretty quick.   Overall a good experience. Price was about $160 for the two of us with a couple drinks each. A couple good dishes and a couple that bombed. Might return for buck-a-shuck  oysters that happens on Sunday."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and the place was overrun with babies! I mean, they were cute, but the one next to me had decided to that the sweet pastry option needed to be crumbled all over the floor and table. Nice to know that they have high-chairs and are family friendly, ready to clean up after your messy kids.   Had the pumpkin pancakes... and oh boy, they not only were hearty, but there were five? six? full-on pancake with the walnuts and chantilly cream. And they were drenched in syrup. Not that I'm complaining, I just felt terrible that I could only eat half of the meal.  The Fritatta was also good, nice and eggy, with lots of fresh ingredients. My guy and I shared the healthy pastry (a small mini loaf that was delish!) as an appetizer, but we were both struggling to finish our individual meals, and I rarely see this guy struggle when it comes to food.   Honestly, I think if the portions were a wee bit smaller, or if I knew how heavy the pancakes were going to be, I would have had a better time.  Great service though, especially in regards to all the kiddies. Everyone is so nice. Originally was going to give it three stars, but the service and the pastries push it up a level. Seriously loved that mini loaf!!"}
{"text":"Skin & Bones is one of those places you want no one to talk about so it can continue to be your quiet, perfect neighbourhood restaurant. The fact is, it's big enough to hold many of us, so for that reason I'm willing to write about how much I adored this meal.  We started with the chicken tails, and a glass of Cava. Chicken tails and CAVA! This is a pairing of dreams. I would go back just to sit at the long, beautiful bar and snack on this. But, seeing as I was with 2 others, we ordered more than that.   We had the pork cracklings, which were OK but mostly just a soft cheese with crispy pork skins. It wasn't an explosion of flavour, but wasn't bad either. Disclaimer, I have a dairy intolerance, so I relied on my chef-brother for his take on this.  The blood sausage: It's a bite of heaven. The flavours are intense - fatty; but not really, big; but not really, a perfect bite. There were 3 of us for 4 pieces, so naturally a dual happened for the 4th slice (I won).  The mains are equally spectacular. We ordered 3/4 of the menu because we were a) celebrating and b) really excited to try this new place. I will say that the main course portions are big. The gnocchi is enough to spilt between 2 people if you also had 2 snacks/apps, but for the very affordable price of this dish just order it for yourself and don't look back. This could be a new-restaurant consideration, and the portions may reduce as the place gets busier? I'm not sure about this.  The wine selection was excellent. I ordered a VQA cab franc with the typical reservations like \"is this going to be too... cab francy?\" Even with my silly questions, the sommelier was knowledgeable and offered some small samples to demonstrate the difference in weight and tannins. In the end everything I tried was smooth, so she was right - all the wine is fantastic.  Lastly I want to highlight the service because it is what made the night amazing for us. I have a dairy intolerance, so I'm afraid of new restaurants where servers might not know there is hidden butter in my selections. Not the case here. The server and kitchen team went WAY out of their way to ensure I knew what was \"safe\" for me to enjoy and what I should let my dinner mates try instead. They offerred suggestions and were kind about the entire thing. I'm thankful for the approach, and thrilled to report the food is DELICIOUS even with my avoiding of all dairy related items.  Overall, we spent a bit of money but we also ordered 4 snacks/apps and 3 mains (for 3 people). Just go. It's delicious, casual, and affordable if you don't go overboard with ordering. The wine is interesting though maybe skewed a bit pricier, but it's a wine bar, so to be expected."}
{"text":"I've come here twice for the Sunday brunch. The space is great - very large and convenient location with plenty of parking nearby.  Both times I had the lentils with mushrooms and poached eggs plus the $3 (!) buffet add-on. The eggs were perfectly poached on both occasions and the dish was delectable without making me feel too guilty for indulging afterwards. Well aside from the buffet, that is. The buffet includes granola, yogurt, cinnamon buns, a variety of jams, olives, cheeses and a large charcuterie spread.  On the first visit, I tasted my friends brisket hash dish and the potatoes were beyond delicious. I'm talking melt-in-your mouth taters seasoned to perfection.   If I based this review solely on the first time I visited, I would be giving it five stars. The staff were friendly and the place was not busy. My friend and I ended up staying and chatting for over two hours and didn't have any sense of disapproval from the servers. They refilled our coffees every now and then and didn't \"offer\" to bring us the bill until we made it clear that we were ready to leave.   However, the second time I came, it was after a good review was written in a popular Toronto publication and the place was packed. The staff were noticeably overwhelmed (albeit still friendly) and it took a while for our drinks to arrive. We got there around 1:00 p.m. and found that the buffet was pretty well picked over and it seemed to take a very long time for some items to be replenished. Damn you NOW magazine!  Overall, I'm hoping the rush dies down as I really enjoyed the food and the friendliness of the staff. Maybe they can hire a few more people and even open for brunch on Saturdays. Until then, I might consider trying their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect in regards to exceeding my expectations. My girlfriend and I visited for valentines evening this past weekend. We ate the Cornish hen ( to die for ) and she had the pork steak.   Amazing.  Paired with wine and a maple bourbon cocktail ( cocktail? ) the dining experience on the food level was without any abrasive elements. Service too was so good! Our waiter Andre was extremely kind.   Great environment too! Love the new paint job. Thanks for the perfect eve."}
{"text":"Gnocchi to die for!!!  Omg. This was my first visit here to this relatively new restaurant. And boy, did it NOT disappoint.  They have an extensive wine list with a great diversity. I had a cab sauv 2009 Napa valley wine that was perfectly balanced and a bit earthy. Just delightful!   The star of the night was gnocchi entree. I forgot the details but just know it's damn good!!! The best gnocchi I've ever had to be honest.   Also tried the sticky toffee pudding. Was alright, a bit too sweet for me but I think that's how toffee pudding is supposed to be so I can't complain.    I definitely suggest you visit Skin and Bones."}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant with gorgeously presented food.  At first glance outside, I was worried that I had gone to the wrong restaurant as it looked empty.  However, upon entering, I realized that the restaurant seating was located at the back, hidden away from the street view.  The dining area was a nicely renovated loft area with an open kitchen on the side.   Menu was small but interesting. Appetizers: Grilled Radish Salad- Amazing!  One of the most interesting and creative dishes that I have actually ever had.  The radishes are grilled and served to resemble beef carpaccio with a delicious green sauce.  HIghly suggest ordering this. Roasted Bone Marrow: Well done, but not different from other restaurants.  Pass on this next time. Mains: Pork Belly: Beautifully presented, but the pork was overcooked, which was very unfortunate as the flavor combinations were great. Basquaise Octopus and Chorizo: Authentically made basquaise, good flavours. Truffled Gnudi: Similar to a gnocchi and delicious all the same.  The addition of hazelnuts and caraway made it more interesting than just a simply butternut squash pasta dish. Overall, great restaurant.  Would definitely return when I have a spare $35 to spend on dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I've eaten here 3 times so far -- I'm shocked it took so long for me to get here, since it's in my neighbourhood. I've eaten brunch - went for the charcuterie choice, and loved what I was able to get in terms of meats, cheeses, and sides to go along with them. Perfect for those doing a paleo diet. For dinner, I've twice had the \"Let Us Feed You\" option - and have thoroughly enjoyed every bite, as did the friends who I was dining with.  Food is all fresh, and it's well timed: a trio of appetizers, then a salad, followed by a pasta, followed by a main, followed by desserts. No sense of rush, just beautifully served dishes with friendly service. Sound gets a little loud by 8pm, so if you want quiet conversation, go for the table for 4 near the door, and get there early."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch last weekend, and found the food to be very good. We had the pancakes with strawberry-rhubarb and the pulled porchetta benny.  The pancakes were pretty small and should be considered a side (and I am not a big eater), but it was pretty delicious and decadent. The benny was more substantial, with a small side salad. It might be worthwhile to add the Ploughman's Buffet (+$3 with entree order), which gives you unlimited access to a charcuterie board, yogurt, granola, fruit, jams, and pastries.  The space is dark and spacious.  I plan to come back some time soon to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"....Unlike the vast selection of vino, the menu at SB is short but well varied, separated into the categories of Snacks, Apps, Mains, Sides & Desserts. While there were a number of items I could have happily tucked into, in the end we opted to go with:  Crispy Chicken Tails with Potato Salad- Apparently filled with bone marrow, the chicken tails had a wicked crunch and oozed with rich fatty goodness. The accompanying potatoes were tender inside, and caramelized outside, and were brought to life by a smear of tangy spicy cream sauce.   Salt Cured Foie Gras, Preserved Quince, Brioche and \"L'Effet Papillon\" Raw Honeydew- A smooth and buttery slice of foie, with just enough sweetness from the quince and honeydew. I loved the crispy ethereal slices of brioche, but I did find they tended to crumble under the weight of the terrine.  Beef Cheek Bourguignon with Sunchokes, Perth Bacon, Roasted Mushrooms and Red Wine Onions- Gilded with little streaks of melted fat, this was some of the most tender and juicy beef ever to grace my lips. My only criticism was that I felt it could have used a touch more salt.  Accompaniments were seasoned much more evenly, with the bits of crispy bacon bringing a kick of smoky flavour. I particularly loved the beautifully cooked sunchokes which lent a nice element of nutty sweetness to the otherwise savoury dish.    Slow Cooked Half Chicken with Rutabaga Puree, Celery and White Wine Sauce- This was probably our least favourite dish, but it still very well prepared. The chicken was generous in portion, astonishingly moist, and seasoned perfectly, while the puree of rutabaga was silky and slightly sweet. However, having been cooked Sous-Vide and thus, lacking the salty crispy skin I appreciate with poultry, I found the texture of the dish a little one-note. Yes, there were a few crunchy fried bits on the plate, but I would have sacrificed half the portion of chicken for something with a little more bite to it.   Brioche Doughnuts with Caramelized White Chocolate- Well, the dessert menu read as if I had written it myself, with both offerings being my two all time favourite sweets, doughnuts and STP.  Despite the menu description, I would say that this was a great dessert for people who don't like things too sweet. The doughnuts were fluffy and light as air, without even a trace of grease or heaviness on my palate, and the caramelized white chocolate lent just enough sugar so as to convince oneself it wasn't another savoury course. Solid dish.  Sticky Toffee Pudding with Figs, Bone Marrow Caramel and Chantilly Cream- But then there was the STP. Now, I consider myself a real STP connoisseur. I order it any time I see it on a menu, and often seek out restaurants just because they offer it.  While certainly not authentic, this one was a real gem. It was beautifully moist, bouncy and soft, and enhanced by the gentle pop of the fig seeds between my teeth. The caramel was sumptuous and sweet without being cloying or heavy, while the Chantilly cream brought a luscious richness to temper the sweetness. Usually STP is a dessert you finish and then (sorta) regret because of all the syrupy sugar going on, but like the rest of the meal at SB, this course felt surprisingly light.  So for 3- 3 oz pours of wine, 2 \"share\" plates, 2 mains, 2 desserts, 1 dessert wine and 1 drip coffee (no cappuccino unfortunately), the bill came to about $150 including tax and tip. I found the prices reasonable, the portions generous, the food well thought out and executed, the room cozy and the service spot on.  It was an enjoyable evening and I'm thrilled to see another winner of a restaurant in Toronto's East. Future restaurateurs, please take note. Leslieville is picking up!"}
{"text":"Great interior, fun vibe and delicious food. Service is slow, so don't be in a rush if you come here. Love this place though!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible spot for brunch on a Sunday. I highly recommend.  ...and why? Spending the weekend in Toronto, I reserved a table for 5 and invited my brothers family. Promptly welcomed, seated and setup with a spot by the open windows. Amazing relaxed vibe with a great breeze and view coming in. I went with the house-smoked brisket hash.  Delicious mix of protein w/ potato, mushrooms, and fried egg. I'm not a foodie, but the amount of care and craft that goes into every dish at S+B is far too obvious to miss.  Across the rest of the table, we had the pulled pork benedict, buttermilk pancakes w/ cherry compote, chantilly cream, maple, + a few ploughman's buffets added on for only $3! I honestly don't know how the buffet brings the variety of rare cheeses, cured meats and baked goods among others for only $3. I'm definitely not doing it justice, but that alone is worth making this a regular spot. From the empty plates, I'd say the rest of the food supports that as well.  Inside, the space and chic looks equally match the quality and effort that goes into the food. I can see this being a great hang out for sipping wine into the evening among beautiful people. Once I'm back from NYC, I'll be giving that a try. Until then, I certainly have this on my list and will be coming back, but next time with reinforcements!"}
{"text":"the wine list and cocktails were great.  The space is a surprise for the area it is in, the facility is quite lofty.  The decor is modern and great for a social night or to host an event.  The food we ordered was ok, they are known for the meats and we did not try their steaks boo on us.  I'd go back for buck a shuck Sundays!"}
{"text":"I had my birthday celebration here for a party of about 25. Daniel the owner was extremely helpful as we planned a family style dinner. The food and service were incredible- every plate got rave reviews and the wine list is fantastic. The place has a great vibe and is definitely one of our favourite places in the neighbourhood. We will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"We had the tasting menu and it was fantastic.  The portions weren't huge,  but they went overboard with the black truffle shavings in our appetizer and it was fantastic.  The beer selection is good with a couple of barley wines on the menu.  Great food and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great space, minimalist decor, attentive but not invasive staff, and a great ambiance - definitely worth looking into for both larger and smaller groups. By coincidence we stopped by for happy hour and had some excellent cocktails and apps. Would definitely go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with a girlfriend here...the ambiance is fantastic, the washrooms clean and the food (charcuterie board, risotto and sticky toffee pudding) & wine superb.  The only issue I had was with the waiter who seemed like he wanted to be anywhere else in the world but where he was.  Too bad because the restaurant would have gotten 5 stars from me if not for him.  I would still highly recommend skin+bones!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love it when a restaurant chef is serious about serving good food, which in my opinion should be the norm as that is what restaurants are there for. However not every restaurant is serious about serving good food unfortunately. This place serves every food in perfection to details. It may be pricey for some people, but I feel that the price is actually reasonable with the ingredients and sophistication of the preparation all taken into consideration. If I lived in this neighborhood, I would definitely frequent here on weekends. Thank you for the wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance. It was such a nice atmosphere. Food was delicious and service was great! I will definitely be going back and I've recommended it to friends and clients alike!"}
{"text":"Oh god this place is incredible!  Me and my date decided to indulge in the Chef's Tasting Menu ($38/pp) and we were not disappointed!   We had the pleasure of tasting the Prosciutto Croquettes with parmigiano reggiano, the Asparagus Salad with quinoa, pine nuts, and apple, the Arctic Char Gravlax with kale, dill, farro, and shallot vinaigrette, the Pork + Ricotta Meatballs with pumpkin seed + basil pesto, and grilled focaccia, the Pork Chop with apple mostarda and arugula and to finish the Carrot Cake with mascarpone, ginger cookie, and vanilla ice cream.  The mood is casual and contemporary- great for a date or to dine with friends.  Our favourite dish by far was the delicious and fatty Pork Chop and apples. We will definitely be back to enjoy more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I love this place.   Great wine, good food, great atmosphere, friendly wait staff and someone greets you at the door to seat you.   I know the last bit sounds like a given but I've been to a couple of places in Leslieville/Riverside where you walk in the door and wait. And wait.  And wait until a server notices you standing there.     At Skin and Bones, you're greeted at the door like you're an old friend.  It's an upscale but comfortable neighbourhood joint where foodies will find a thoughtful tasty menu and people more used to chain restaurants won't feel unwelcome.  I've been a few times over the last few weeks and plan on going back.   One of the best places in the hood."}
{"text":"Best: Service, Consistent quality dishes, Atmosphere Worst: Nothing  Guilty Pleasure: Lamb meatballs  I've been coming back to Skin and Bones since it's opening and finally decided to write a review after another stunning meal.  Dropped by on a Sunday for their oyster night and had several other side dishes which were all cooked to perfection (try the octopus and the gnocchi, you won't regret it).  Every time I've been here, the service and the food have been consistently top notch.  While it's on the higher end, there is no sense of pretentiousness, just warm and professional attention.  While the restaurant is more geared towards wine, they also make a great old fashion as well.  Along with Black Hoof, one of the restaurants that I keep coming back to.  Now to try their brunch..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here!  My husband and I have been and ordered the chef's menu which proved great on many levels: we are too tired to make decisions being one and second, the food was absolutely incredible. They also were wonderful in helping me plan a moms night out with 13 women (an ever-evolving number).  We had an incredible feasting menu which proved to be insane value for money.  We were absolutely stuffed by the time the mains came out as each course was delicious and we ate every morsel.  Seriously - we scarfed down so much beef tartar that it was hard to fit in the whole fish and steak that came next (I may have finished off three of the plates because it is seriously so good)  Service was fabulous and attentive.  Great restaurant for a big group!"}
{"text":"Skin and Bones deserves 10 stars. We had an incredible evening at this restaurant. We had the Chef's menu and it was sublime. The charred green beans are perfection as are the rapini croquettes. The gnocchi literally melt in your mouth, they are by far the best I have had. We had several other dishes that were also beautifully presented with layers of gorgeous flavours. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly. The ambience warm and inviting. The kitchen staff highly competent. We will be returning to Skin and Bones before long. Absolutely sublime.  Have to mention the pumpkin spice cake as well ..... Oh my!!!!!"}
{"text":"Solid five star service- unobtrusive yet attentive. Servers of the world, take note! This is the way to do it.  Food is fantastic. Chef's Menu is my fave, as you don't have to choose from the amazing options. Desserts are delish and there are a wide range of beers and wines to choose from (or have your super star server recommend something to match your meal. You won't be disappointed.)  I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"S+B has been elevated to five stars. Why? THAT BRUNCH.  Reservations, for one. Sparkling water on the house. Coat Check. And the most wonderful Ploughman's brunch buffet. For $14, tremendous value.  Delicious cheeses, house-cured meats, pastries, yogurt, granola, poached fruit and preserves. My DCs had entrees from the brunch menu and added the brunch for $3. Everyone was stuffed silly, with hands down the highest quality breakfast foods I have had the pleasure of consuming in recent memory. Completely luxurious, and very fairly priced. Service was calm, friendly and unhurried unlike any of the line-up brunch spots in the neighbourhood.  Completely thrilled with the changes to Skin and Bones. Will return."}
{"text":"While none of the dishes were bad, I can't say any were actually memorable. In fact, it's less than a week later, and I'm wondering what I ate for dinner. The service was fantastic though. Our waitress was personable and thoughtful and made an okay meal that much better. I'm glad I finally checked this place out just to cross it off my list."}
{"text":"My bf and I had dinner and Skin and Bones last night. The food was absolutely delicious. The service however was poor. In addition to the poor service, the restaurant was not air conditioned and the windows were wide open. We were sweating the entire time. I think the temperature would have made our experience a lot better."}
{"text":"We went there tonight to dine and catch up with friends. Since none of us are familiar with the place, we tool the bold move and chose \"Let us feed you\" menu. The server was great. He told us it's gonna be nice surprises for every dishes, and also recommended a bottle of wine.   For under $40 person (before tax, tip, and wine), we each shared 2 sets of course meal (including 3 appetizers, 1 main, and 1 desserts). Every dish was very nicely done! Well-balanced, well-seasoned, fresh and taste like homemade: Charred green beans, roasted beets, croquettes, gnocchi with tomato sauce, pork steak, and sticky toffee pudding.  We're all very satisfied with the quality and the service. It's definitely a place worth going for great food and cozy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"What a great night at skin and bones.  The food is prepared with such care and the service is the same, so unpretentious and genuinely helpful.  I MIGHT be in a better mood because of the martini, whiskey sour and cider but that's not it, this is a very good place.  I had the heirloom tomato salad, octopus, beef tongue (not ew, yum!) all shared with my wife and then she had the mackerel while I had the Cornish hen as our mains.  Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection.  We've had a great evening and look forward to returning to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This place ruined my 27th birthday.  I had to personally apologize to all my guests for their awful service at the restaurant and even though some guests wanted to order entrees they were never asked if they wanted food so out of my own pocket I ordered pizza when we all got back to the after party. It took me 3 hours to get two glasses of wine the service was unbearably slow and inaccurate.  Waiter was too nervous to approach people and several people in the group had to get up or flag someone else down to be served and it was not a crowded night. I had to ask the manager 'please, can you ask everyone at the table if they want another drink or dessert' and he never did. The group was never asked if we were finished or wanted additional wines, they simply took the menus away. Eventually, when the lack of service became so unbearable, the manager was contacted and even he spent ~30 minutes trying to sort the bills out properly and did not even apologize for the service, at first they refused to split up our bills even though I explained that I did not want to pay for everyone on my credit card because I didn't know every single person well and we'd have to spend more time figuring out who owes what instead of enjoying the rest of my night. A friend went up to the manager and explained the situation and all he could say was 'what do you want me to do'"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try out this place for a while now. I follow them on Fb and the pictures they post always make my mouth water. Going by the name of the resto Skin +Bones I  had this idea in my mind  this was a hipsterish   restaurant that served uncomplicated dishes for an arm and a leg. I was pleasantly surprised to find that  this is a super sleek resto with great food and great service. Our server later explained what inspired the name of the resto Skin for  grape skins and Bones for animal bones. Makes sense right?  The Space Spacious dining area, the back dining room serves as their PDR for special events and it also has a 12 seater bar top that offers the full menu.The ambiance is casual and relaxed.  The Drinks No girly cocktails here!.They make them nice and stiff. I definitely got  my money's worth. I only had one drink all night and I had  a pretty good buzz going. I had a Negroni and my bf  had the Toronto and the Smoked Bardstown.  The Food We came the day after Vday and they were still offering their pre fix menu $90 for 2 ppl which was a great deal but we opted for the a la carte menu. I had the Radicchio salad which had the best croutons I've had and they  seemed to be made in house My bf  ordered the pork cracklings that were good but  he thought they are best to share. For my main I had the grilled octopus with chickpeas.The octopus was cooked perfectly not chewy at all and the chickpeas had a great citrus kick to them. My bf had the pork belly which you can never go wrong with. For dessert we shared the sticky toffee this was decadent and delicious.  The Service our server Chris was very knowledgeable and elevated our experience  by giving us great recommendations and explaining the dishes in detail.  I would come back here in a heartbeat. i'd love to try their brunch next time."}
{"text":"Do not come here for large groups!!! This is one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. It could be the fact we had a large group, but considering reservations were made in advance and they offer family style, what we were served was truly unacceptable.   $55 plus 18% tips plus 15% taxes, we were served: - One piece of fish on top of a cracker/toast  - One deep fried risotto ball of some sort - One pork meatball  - Carrot salad, which each person got maybe 4 pieces of carrots and 5 pieces of arugula  - Six pieces of gnocchi  - One slice of steak (about an 12oz steak sliced was served for 6 people) - One slice of porkchop - A then shitload of deep fried parsnips and potatoes - One piece of barely warm chocolate bread   It was more of a tasting menu gone wrong instead of \"family style\". We were all left hungry and pretty much spent 70% of the time complaining about the the food, the quantity and the service we received.   I guess this is the reason why it's called Skin + Bones lol, give you one bite of everything. This family style dinner is like what you would feed to your annoying relatives, wanting to starve them out of your house. Do not ever come here for any large group parties."}
{"text":"The staff is awesome, specially when you are a regular. We had the surprise prix fixe and boy its a lot of food. Everything on the menu has never deceieved. I may have 2 items I have not tried. Sunday 1$ oysters is the shiiit lol the meatballs are a must try. For the oysters arrive before 7:30 or you will be shit out of luck.the short ribs is a tat fatty And I don't like fat but my girl loved it. So to each their own. The beet salad is to die for. Owner is there usually he's sweet and yummy accent! If ur looking for a warm place, good food, drinks, lovely people, intimate than this is the place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.   Resturant was little small. Very tight seating. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Had a small family dinner with mom and dad here: we stuck to a bunch of appetizers and had a bottle of sparking wine.  Excellent service! Everyone were charming, attentive and informed. A great balance of paying attention to our drinks/water but giving us privacy. The food was great - not sure how the mains are, but I enjoyed all of the appetizers we tried. (Brussel sprouts were a memorable favourite).  They were quite busy but sat us at the edge of the communal table which provided for just the right amount of privacy and quietness."}
{"text":"I've been to Skin+Bones twice now. The first time I went they had only been opened for about a month. When walking in I loved the ambiance, the bar is large wooden high table which we sat at. The selections of wine was amazing however the menu is tiny and left a bit to be desired. We started with the  Octopus salad and a crispy chicken app, they were both delicious. We then ordered the Celeriac Gnocchi to share as the apps were a good size. After a half an hour of waiting for the main the manager came over and apologized, he told us the first batch of Gnocchi didn't turn out and they were making a new batch. He was very apologetic and offered us free Champagne and dessert, which was definitely a bonus. Upon receiving the Gnocchi it was divine, \"little pillows of heaven\" was what we called them. We ordered the donuts for dessert and they satisfied my sweet tooth. Because everything was made right after us waiting for a while I really liked this place.   I decided to have my birthday dinner here in the summer. I had about 15 people and we sat at a large table in the back. The wine was good as always but the food was not on par. Most of us had the steak which we found very fatty and the sides were so-so. I was very disappointed because I had raved about this place to my friends and family and no one was impressed. Having said that I don't think I will be back for a while, there are  so many other places to try in Leslieville. They need to step up their game."}
{"text":"i'm into this place. came here around 10:30am for Sunday brunch and there wasn't a wait- but maybe the rain contributed.   i got the pork belly benedict and my dining guest got the korean fried chicken + waffles. the pork belly wasn't too fatty like some other brunch places, and offered amazing flavour to pair against the hollandaise sauce and the focaccia. both dishes were delicious- we both thought we'd be able to finish it off but i left some salad on my plate and he left some of the waffle.   would come back if the menu changed- but otherwise, nothing else at the menu jumped out at me. it was quite a limited menu but for what they offer, they do it well."}
{"text":"Small plates (veggie's plates, meatballs, tuna) but wonderful. Wine was great, A little expensive for a glass, but very good. Chef was passionate about his meals that he delivered to us.  I would go back to try more of those little plates. Kitchen closed at 11am on wednesday night."}
{"text":"We loved it so much the first time, we decided to bring the family this next time to celebrate his birthday. We had the feasting menu and boy was it a feast. Everything we had was so delicious and everyone was impressed. There were 7 of us and there was so much food that we had leftovers the next day.   Every review seems to rave about the food because it's great. I would like to also point out how attentive the staff was during our time there. Someone out of our group is allergic to shellfish so she couldn't have the oysters we ordered for the table, The team at S+B made a special appetizer just for her without our request. Another thing I remember was how we never felt rushed. There was a lot of food but the timing was just so we had enough time to digest, have a some drinks and chat before the next course arrived. And each time the servers arrived with food, the group got excited and were wowed by the dishes that were laid before us :))  Thank you Chef and Skin+Bones team for another memorable night."}
{"text":"The food is simply fantastic. Rustic variants of French, Italian and Spanish dishes; amazing flavour and perfectly prepared. Have been there twice and plan to return. Service and atmosphere are also super."}
{"text":"Great location. Super friendly and fast service.  Food was finger licking good.  We came in for a late Brunch around 1 :40 pm and they close the kitchen at 2 pm. They still happily served us!   I ordered the spicy chicken  waffle and oh wow I was happily surprised.  We also got the bakers plate which was 3 items from the bakery. Apparently it changes every week.  All good items were exquisitely tastes and we'll presented.   Well worth the Buck."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I am soooo happy on a cold Saturday night, in desperate need of food and far from home... I did a quick yelp search and for this place. I've come across it before but didn't think much to try it... But tonight it was like faith.   We got a table by the window. The setting is intimate but the atmosphere is very casual and full of locals. It was a really comfortable and the wait staff was friendly and helpful when we asked for directions for something.    The food... We started with the prosciutto croquette which was like dangggg... I wish we got two orders as i was hoping Dave wouldn't like it. Dave had the Cornish hen. It had like a citrus glaze to it, it was moist and crispy skin which equals delicious. I had the gnocchi, it was different from what I'm used to. This was light and fluffy. Usually the gnocchi I've had is dense and fills you up. This wasn't a heavy dish and I finished it in no time. It was lightly sauced and had mushrooms and rapini. Very tasty dish.    It was a great eating experience. I wish I got to look around at the space some more. The bar was cool and the back of the restaurant had bookshelves. Will be back to tell you more about it :)   Looking forward to try the brunch menu!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here, tldr; overpriced and food is average.   Service was pretty good, but everything else a little bit of a disappointment. The bravette steak was well presented, however the meat was a bit chewy. I've had better cocktails for the price too.   I've got to write this one off as overhyped - with too much effort on the aesthetics and too little on the food."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how delicious EVERYTHING was. The octopus, to die for, the beef tongue (which I sometimes can handle but never love) I LOVED. The steak is a not to miss item either, served with a chimichurri sauce on the side that was devine. My boyfriend and I also shared the pork which had a good amount of fat on it but was easy to cut off if one was not into fattier meat but for those of us who love it was the best of both worlds. Not as heavy as a pork belly but not as dry or chop like as a typically pork chop. They were out of the lamb which I was dying to try... Good sign it must be epic. My only only critique would be to add a few more sides to the menu. Theirs were great but 4 would be a better call than 2. Worth coming to the up and coming leslyville neighborhood for!"}
{"text":"Great food and I'm always a fan of anywhere you can get an espresso after lunch. Servers are very helpful. (We had a few vegeterians in the group and a lactose intolerance, so we had some pesky questions.) Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Toronto dining scene.  I enjoyed each dish ordered that Chef Mathew created so thoughtfully.  This is classic bistro cuisine, yet, elevated nicely and quirkily.  Also, their wine list is nicely put together, with affordable gems galore.  Can't go wrong dining here."}
{"text":"Excellent way to start my Toronto food tour. The service was top notch, I had one of the most enthusiastic and knowledgeable servers ever. The food was excellent an full of flavor with simple ingredients. Cocktails were also very bare which kind of pays homage to the name of the restaurant,  no garnish or flash just a good drink."}
{"text":"I only had wine and the scallops so I didn't try enough to really warrant a review. However, based on what we got, I would not go back. I liked the taste of the dish but really disliked the thin, horizontally sliced scallop. And the wine was pretty overpriced. Very loud, nearly impossible to hear my companion."}
{"text":"Just had the most perfect evening at this restaurant and had to come home and immediately review which my happy-glow was still there :)  1) So easy to make reservations online.  Love that. 2) They called to confirm my reservation the day before.  Love that. 3) When I got there (15 minutes early), they let me choose from 4 great table options.  Love that. 4) They treated me with respect and patience while I waited for my two guests.  Love that. 5) They humoured us while we took thirty minutes to pick a drink option.  When we were finally ready for to pick, we needed some help, and their advice was spot on and helpful.  Love that.  6) The ambiance of the room was great - a gentle hum, lots of space between tables, comfortable chairs, correct temperature, and clean+nice bathrooms.  Love...well, okay, you get the idea.  7) Maple bourbon sour drink was AMAZING! Smiles all around. 7.5) I had a gift card and I asked them to check how much was on it.  The waitress came back to the table and discreetly whispered to me the amount.  I love when servers are clearly seasoned and 'get it'.  Thank you.  8) We opted for the \"chef feeds you\" mystery meal.  $38 per person.  I told my friends I thought it was about 4 courses....I was very wrong.  They treated us like princesses.  We had course after course of delicious, well thought out, perfect dishes.  Highlights for me were the pork steaks (OMG), the pumpkin ice cream, the peppers, the...who am I kidding. There were no real misses.  The value of this meal was off the charts.  This was a $75 meal easily, for $38 a head.  9) I was there for FOUR HOURS.  They pace the courses so you have a real, true, fun evening with your friends.  They never rushed us.  They wanted to make it a \"night out\", and they did. 10) I live downtown.  I came all the way East (for me, quite east!) for this evening.  They went above and beyond, for no reason other than being true hosts.  Because of these ten reasons, I would go out of my way to be back.   Thank you so much Skin + Bones!  I hope you read Yelp reviews so you know how great you are!"}
{"text":"went there about 3 weeks ago with a group of 8. We got to taste pretty much everything on the menu and everything was delicious. The menu is inventive and carefully prepared. I did find that the size of the appetizers to be too small- a few bites and gone.  But mains were also on a smaller side- size wise- but this allowed us to eat a bit of everything so I'm not complaining. I just thought I should mention that my boyfriend who is a big eater ordered about 3 main dishes to feel satisfied.  My favourites were the beef cheek, the fish dish (the one with fried oysters accompanying it) and of course the chicken tails!   The bar wasn't as well stocked as we would have liked- but then again it is a wine bar and they had an extensive wine list. However, they weren't prepared to make something as simple and as popular as an old fashioned which I think is something that they can probably supplement.   the decor was a little bare. I wonder if they will be adding more touches or if this is it. It felt empty and industrial. Which i don't mind but didn't find the decor to be interesting at all.   the server was great, she checked on us in between out meals and made sure that our drinks were not empty.  I will definitely go back but it's one of those places i'd go back with a group of friends and not just with the boyfriend."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to be the 100th review!!  I had such an amazing dinner Saturday night I returned for brunch the next morning with a new set of friends. No lie!  The food is incredible but so is the service. Our water glass was never empty, our cutlery changed 3 times, we had table cleaning between each course and our server was so quite - it was like having a personal tidy ninja!  We had the following between 4 on Saturday for dinner. APPS: - Chicken Liver Mouse (AMAZING) - Grilled Octopus (Simple & Delicious) - Rapini Croquettes (Savoury and Scrumptious)  - Cheese plate (small, but delicious selections!)  ENTREE: All were FANTASTIC! - Pork Steak - Cornish Hen - Branzino - Bavette Steak Medium Rare  DESSERT: - Sticky Toffee Pudding is warm and a hearty fall desert - amazing - Lemon Posset Was sort of like a fancy lemon yogurt - delicious!  Brunch the next AM was a totally different vibe - I had the peas on toast - which is likely the best version of eggs Benedict I've ever had. The other girls had the classic eggs Benny with pastrami. We all shared in mimosas which were poured generously :)"}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. I've been here twice. We sat at the bar. The servers are personable and helpful with recommendations. The cheese board was tasty. Entrees (fish and steak) were both good. The highlight was the cauliflower. Exceptional."}
{"text":"I was able to snag a walk-in spot by the bar at skin and bones on a Saturday.  They have limited seating, enough for maybe 4-5 couples they can accommodate for walk in.  The restaurant itself has a classy feel and is actually quite large with a sizable back room for parties.  They were still doing their $90 valentines day special but we chose to order a la carte.  I had the pork skin to start.  Recommended, but share it with a friend as they are a bit too much alone.  They come with a sour cream type dip.  Moved on to pork belly for my main - delicious.  They manage to get the meat tender as if it was steamed or boiled, but keep the skin hard and crispy.  This was on top of cabbage with an apple sauce type puree.  The allure of this restaurant is relatively simple dishes, but cooked very well.  Also recommended was the rapini salad that my date had.  Word of warning: it's not a healthy salad by any means, with generous wallops of sour cream.  I had the sticky toffee for dessert, which is likely the best on the menu.  I tried both the Toronto and Paper Plane cocktails.  They are not bad, but lean on the orange zest/peel taste.  The paper plane comes sans ice and both are very boozy.  Our server was professional and friendly.  Definitely not the pretentious feel you may get elsewhere.  One thing I noticed is they have an extensive wine list and electronic dispenser, so not a bad call to ask for a wine recommendation with your meal.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times now and each time it has been consistently great. The place lends itself to dining out with friends. It's casually decorated - simple tables and lots of them. Also lots of buzz in the room. Our servers have all been excellent - knowledgeable without being obtuse; always there when you need them but not joining in the conversation at the table. The food is excellent - local and seasonal, which I appreciate. As a starter, as odd as it sounds, the charred green beans are delicious and the roasted beets, heavenly. The home-made gnocchi as a main was amazing as was the whole branzino. I hear they have a great brunch, which I am looking forward as my next adventure there. Highly, highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Perfect portions and preparation.    I had the bavette steak.   It was juicy (not bloody) and the associated greens were a perfect compliment.   Had it with a Gamay Noir.   -----  Recommend for groups,  expectedly pricey."}
{"text":"The food here is good and the staff are generally quite lovely. The Sunday specials are the main reason I frequent this restaurant - can't beat half price sparkling, buck a shuck oysters and fried chicken! I've had the tasting menu a couple times and was disappointed the last time around. The food was still good, but pay the $5 more and go to Ruby Watchco for more substantial serving sizes."}
{"text":"This is one of my traditions with my mom. We come here, I admire the waiters and we both salivate at the menu, and we have a delicious meal of exactly what our collective subconscious wanted - crunchy, fresh and sinful fabulously prepared food.   It helps that she picks up the tab because it's plus cher than I like to pay, but it is always an amazing meal that leaves us more contented with the world."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. After leaving Skin and Bones, you'll definitely have some meat on your bones. I came here for a friend's birthday party and it was ahhhmazing.  First off, we rolled up a on Sunday for Champagne Campaign... half price bottles of booze. What more could you ask for? I don't remember all of the bottles that we had, but they were all very good. Also had the East Coast oysters because they were a buck-a-shuck and they were also ahhhmazing. A bit on the salty side, but the texture was great.  As for food, here's the run down on what we ordered: *Cheese Board Three Cheeses- there was a blue cheese, brie, and 5 year old cheddar from Ottawa. The cheddar was so strong, so old, and so good. Loved it. Blue was super creamy and delicious. Brie was brie. You can never go wrong with brie.   *House Made Charcuterie Board- I didn't pick off of this dish, but I heard it was tasty *Warm Marinated Olives- warm olives? YUM.  *Crab Apple Glazed Pork Belly- Meat was so tender... sweet baby jesus.  *Mortadella Stuffed Chicken Breast- best choice of the night. Chicken was super moist and flavorful from the mortadella. I'm not a huge mortadella fan, but I wasn't complaining when it was in the chicken. There wasn't any Swiss Chard that night, so it was swapped out for kale, but again, wasn't complaining. The celeriac puree made this dish. Nailed it.  *Truffled Gnudi (nude-y)- roasted squash was awesome. Hazelnuts in the nude-y added this great texture. Good lawddd. *Ice Cream sandwich- a gigantic slab of dark chocolate ice cream. Supposed to feed one... I needed a defib after one bite. So good, so rich, and super yummy with the peanut brittle  *Sticky toffee pudding- Didn't think I'd like it, but I loved it. It was a salty sweet combo... def something you should try.     Overall, awesome experience. I think I needed someone to wheel me out of the place once we were done, but it was so worth it. We had a great waiter who was super helpful and suggested some great drinks for our food choices. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It is really rare that I write a review, however I felt strongly that one was required in this case. A large group of us went to Skin and Bones for dinner - split 11 ppl at my table and 12-14 at the other. We were provided with a fixed-price menu at $55 and the meal was served family style. At the set cost, the total per person inclusive of tax and gratuity was $72, before drinks. I have visited other restaurants with fixed price menus around this price range (Carbon Bar, Ruby Watchco, etc) but never have I experienced a collective view among most that joined me last night that the portions were beyond underwhelming - to the point that we felt cheated. Every single person, male or female, left hungry. Skipping past the appetizers to keep this review shorter, the main course was both pork tenderloin and rib eye steak. The family style plating was served at my table in two sections - so the steak and pork set in front of me was meant for 6 people. My portion of each was 1 slice. The steak was likely 10 ounces, the pork 10 ounces. That's 20 ounces of meat for 6 people. While the food was tasty, the portions were ridiculously small. Beyond comprehension - especially for $55 per person. We literally kept looking to the kitchen for the missing steaks. I had an Oreo Mcflurry on the way home (and flirted with the idea of a Big Mac) - after spending $140 as a couple + liquor on my meal."}
{"text":"Had fantastic meal with terrific service. Uncomplicated food with beautiful ingredients. Excellent local cheese. Really one of those fine meals that only come along once in awhile."}
{"text":"We booked a table last minute at Skin+Bones for my graduation. This was a huge occasion for myself and my family, who travelled from Mexico to see me receive my degree. Not only did they accommodate our large table, they weren't phased by our tardiness (the ceremony ran an hour long), or by my very loud Mexican mother who all but took control of the restaurant while we settled in. Service was impeccable, and our hard to please guests (who ranged from picky eaters to world travellers who have eaten at the best restaurants of the world) were all blown away by the food, the wine, and the atmosphere. The branzino was to die for, the gnocchi was the bomb, and the tuna crudo was a revelation. My uncle called the dinner magnificent, and my mother, who already financed my entire education, was blown away by how affordable it was (if you discount the 200 dollars of wine, it came down to around 35 dollars per person for a staggering amount of food). The only complaint was the lack of espresso machine! Hopefully they will have one the next time we come.  I wish I could express how special the evening was, and how much of that I can attribute to the amazing experience at this wonderful restaurant. I know that I will be returning, and so will my family. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, and I hope to celebrate my next graduation there as well. Thank you!"}
{"text":"*BRUNCH REVIEW*  The last time I was at Skin + Bones, Matthew Sullivan was still \"man\"-ing the kitchen. and I had gone for dinner. The food was good, but the portion sizes on the small side and the prices were on the high side.  Kim Hernandez then hopped on board but as per the restaurant, she too has since parted ways.  In the void of an exec chef, a consulting chef was brought on board, but the restaurant plans to announce a new exec chef later this month.  If this past weekend's brunch experience is any indication, the kitchen is doing just fine without a knife-wielding leader.  First and foremost, I love the space.  It's industrial-like without being cold and uninviting and I'm always a fan of the loft-like exposed brick.  For those who love to bask in the lime sunlight, the front of the restaurant is ideal as the large windows let in plenty of sunshine; for those who like to turn the lights down low (or turn up the romance), I'd suggest a seat towards the rear of the restaurant.  It's also worth noting the view of the kitchen is most visible in the back.  This Leslieville hot spot has been lauded for its well-selected wine list since it opened. It's one of those \"coincidentally the food is pretty good too\" type of places.  After having read many good things about their ploughman's brunch (just add $3 with the order of any entrée); I decided to revisit.  While the brunch menu is no buffet when it comes to options, the selection covers all your typical brunch foods, this isn't your typical greasy spoon fare.  Porchetta Benedict.  Poached egg, Hollandaise, cheddar polenta.  This is exactly the kind of brunch dish that will wake you up (and it won't be because you ordered a coffee).  The porchetta has a perfectly crispy and addictive crackling (though they may want to change up the hardware, read cutlery since a spreading knife makes it hard to cut through); the creamy polenta with rapini is cheesy, creamy goodness (comparable to the grits of Acadia fame); and the orgasmic, runny-yolk, perfectly poached egg and Hollandaise makes you want to roll over onto your couch and stay there for the rest of the day.  Comfort food at its best!  It's one of those dishes that you wish you could savor but find it hard to as you lick up the last bit of polenta from your dish in shame and drop your fork in triumph.  Buttermilk fried chicken breast.  Slaw, ranch mayo on sourdough. I always love me some fried chicken - even if it is 11AM on a Sunday morning.  While this dish didn't wow as much as the porchetta; it is some finger lickin' good fried chicken.  Sorry Colonel, you'll have to move aside.  At first I was hesitant to order it because it was white meat which usually tends to mean I devour the breading and leave most of the dry, bland pieces of breast meat unfinished.  You won't find that here. These breasts get sous-vided and are then twice-fried for added crispiness.  It is one of the juiciest chicken breasts I've had and makes for a damn good (open-faced) sandwich. The sourdough was good in its own right, but the dish really didn't benefit from its presence.  We added the ploughman's buffet for an additional $3 to our entrées, which was worth it as an add-on (otherwise $14 on its own).  There were 2 meats and 3 cheeses on the day we went, along with house-baked goods such as palmiers, cheddar biscuits, scones, croissants and all the fixings (mustard, preserves, vanilla poached pears which I needed a bowl of just for myself, loved the hint of star anise), and homemade granola.  A small, but yummy selection that went great with my hot chocolate.  The hot chocolate definitely had the froth going for it, but in terms of creaminess or rich chocolate flavor it dragged behind.  It definitely meets Amy Pataki's standards in terms of appearances (according to her, hot chocolates should be closer to white or in other words the color of milk) but it still needs a bit of work in the flavor department.  The coffee was quite good and was topped up when it ran low.  The damage at the end of the day was about $50 including tax and tip.  Being someone who brunches not infrequently, While there will never truly be a replacement in my heart for the Hoof Café - Skin + Bones comes in at a close second and has definitely become my brunch joint of choice.  I can't wait to find out who the new exec chef is and since the food had much more wow-factor than my previous dining experience, am encouraged to return for dinner again."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentines and was greeted warmly by the hostess at the front of the restaurant. She very politely hung our jackets and was kind enough to ask us if we were happy with our seating.  The food was delicious. Wine was fantastic as well. I wouldn't of had any complaints other than the server we had was brutal. He actually took our appetizer away when we were still eating it. He was very abrupt in the way he interacted with us. Happened to ask him what were the most popular dishes or what he liked the best. He was annoyed that I seemed to ask such an \"inappropriate question\". His answer was \"everything is good - it is up to you\". Wow thanks!!!!  I mentioned casually to another staff at the restaurant that he had taken away our appetizers when we weren't even finished and the staff agreed that he is known to be \"grabby\".  I would love to return but definitely don't want to be served by that waiter again......  Otherwise an awesome experience and I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Incredible!  We had the tasting menu and it was one of the best Meals we've ever had.  It's as if the chef new exactly what we wanted.  The service started out a little slow at the bar but the waitress quickly noticed and stepped it up for us, the whole experience was phenomenal. We will definitely come back whenever we can."}
{"text":"Been a fan of their food and visiting regularly since they opened, however service has become so arrogant and pretentious that I shall never spend my hard earned money there ever again!..."}
{"text":"The place is starting to look a bit dated, but the food is definitely good. The room is large,  yet cozy, with a good selection of food and drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to Skin + Bones numerous times and they consistently exceed my expectations. So it was a no-brainer that I chose them to host my rehearsal dinner. Lisa and Danny, the owners, did a fantastic job to serve a family style meal to my guests. The food and service was tremendous and the restaurant went over and above to ensure that our guests were well fed and taken care of. I can't say enough great things about our dining experience."}
{"text":"Great food Great Service  My wife and I stopped in here on Mother's Day with no reservations and luckily given seats at bar.  The service was great, precessional and yet casual and laid back at the same time.  I ordered something and didn't like a particular component and asked for a deletion which, these days you are often scolded for and told flatly NO. Our server said sure and even offered some substitutions at no charge. I understand not wanting to substitute/change things on a tasting menu for example but in today's restaurant asking for a subsidizing is taken as an insult to the chef.  I had a fantastic steak.   We will gladly go back here on a non work night to sample some of the extensive aperitif menu."}
{"text":"We went on Friday night after securing a last minute table on open table. We were promptly seated at a tall table near the kitchen window. The restaurant was full and buzzing with people. Quickly we noticed a very large group (20 or so) people still waiting for their meals  We had our drinks from the bar, which was great as it took almost 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge us and come to the table.   We ordered our meal which included the steak for my friend and grilled octopus for myself. There was a very long wait for the food as the kitchen was extremely backed up. As a result we received a complimentary cheese board which I thought was a nice touch and made the wait a bit more bearable.  The cheese board had 3 selections a goat, Gouda and a blue in honey. They were all excellent if you're a cheese lover like myself you would enjoy this. Not too overpowering, but just right.  Our meals came out after about an hour. I found the steak to be a bit tough but it was a muscle type of steak and it's possible a medium cooking type was a bit overkill. My grilled octopus was delicious and served with a side of grilled rapini and some beans. The main criticism is that it was too salty, like a salt shaker spilled into my beans!  Overall the restaurant has a good ambience and the food was also great. A couple criticisms are that the menu selection is quite small and also are the portion sizes!"}
{"text":"My bf and I came here for brunch yesterday... I'm giving them five stars this time around! Skin+Bones is quickly becoming my new favourite restaurant.   We both ordered the poached eggs with French lentils and mushrooms dish (which goes for $11), and we both added on the Ploughman's Buffet for an additional $3. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the lentils and the mushrooms were simple but done really well. The Ploughman's Buffet was a great deal as an add-on to your main brunch dish, consisting of granola, charcuterie, cheeses, and pastries. So in addition to everything being really yummy, it was also one of the more reasonably priced brunches I have had in Toronto.   I'd like to mention again how great the service is here. Super friendly and attentive with none of the attitude.   I can't wait until the next time we go to Skin+Bones again!"}
{"text":"I would hive this place 3/4 stars. Went here for brunch with a couple of friends for brunch i ordered waffle for breakfast it was toi sweet too much honey or syrup used and friend chrcken was over cooked and too much deep fried..there was like no meat there just bread soaked in deep fried oil.kinda gross actually"}
{"text":"After my previous (average) experience at Skin + Bones, the restaurant got in touch with me to communicate that there had actually been a mix up in the kitchen. They sent me a gift card which enticed me to come back and give it another try. I recently went back for brunch and it was amazing! Service was prompt and friendly. All of the food was soo good. My friend and I got the Mushrooms on toast which was delicious. Our boyfriends got the S+B burger and the crispy pork Benedict and we got pancakes for the table. Soo good! The brunch has definitely won me over and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Well worth the hike across the river!! Heard some buzz about this location from some industry folks i trust and decided to pop in with my GF and another couple... Easy to find on the north east corner ... lots of street parking... neighborhood is deff up and coming... we saw quiet a few people out... kinda like queen west with a more mature vibe... easily strolled in and grabbed a table... lots of variously priced and sized dishes but the star is deff the wine list... without even trying we had 4bottles and 3 hours vanish on us!!! the vibe of the patrons and the upbeat helpful nature of the staff was bang on!  with a full stomach and a deff glow on we made plans to come back next weekend... with resos! this place will start to book up fast... its going to be a hidden treasure for a short amount of time before every serious foodie starts flocking to it!"}
{"text":"I had my birthday party there with 22 of my friends. Everything was superb. I've been back multiple times after, and was impressed each time. It's also very reasonably priced for the quality of food, drinks and environment."}
{"text":"I came here over the weekend and had the 4 course family style dinner for two people, a very popular choice to order. The chef prepared us 6 spectacular dishes, which included:  Charred green beans - so good, but they could have relaxed on the sea salt and gave us a few more green beans.  Roasted beets with whipped mascarpone- loved this dish, very refreshing  Croquettes - nothing special  Pork steak with baby kale -  the piece of meat was very fatty but it was nicely seasoned and juicy.   House made gnocchi - my fav of the night, the gnocchi taste like pillows, I wish they gave us more though.  Pumpkin sticky toffee cake - I didn't really taste the pumpkin flavor, it tasted more like a regular sticky toffee pudding, BUT, it was delicious and not overly sweet.    Here comes the negative points - the portions are small and not really filling. I could have had a few extra apps or an extra dessert. The cost to order each item individually cost exactly the same as ordering the 4 course family style dinner, so there are no cost savings. Next time I would just order a la carte."}
{"text":"We stopped by Skin + Bones in June and were pleasantly surprised. Since we're going out to a show after, we opted for the appetizers and a single entree.   The sheets of papers came out first, and we're nice blend of heat with a delicious aioli sauce. Our entree was the fried perch, and it was also quite delicious. However, we did find a perch was a little bland. All in all the overall ambience and decor of the restaurant is very nice. They also have a very good beer selection."}
{"text":"The service was very good. Friendly and professional. Four course tasting menu was just enough and a good first timer Choice. I'll go back for more of the appetizers.    The room is quite loud but with the windows open on a spring/summer night, it made for a great ambiance.    Food was delicious. The salsa verde had capers and was delicious. Everything else was fresh and seasonal. Mediocre wine list and on the high-end price point. I'll go back again to sample more items and for to great service."}
{"text":"Welcome to Leslieville, Skin + Bones!!  To quote my wife, make no bones about it, but this is a wine-lovers wine bar.  I really love the restaurant's clarity of concept and discipline in execution.  They plan to have upwards of 40 whites and 40 reds available by the glass once they are fully up and running.  These wines will come from a wide range of regions and price points, which gives those of us hoping to improve our understanding of wine a great place to learn.    Yesterday, which was their opening day to the public, they had about 15 whites and 15 reds by the glass.  I was positively overwhelmed by the choice: from Prince Edward Country to Niagara to Cali to Greece to Portugal.  Lots of choice and interesting varietals rarely seen elsewhere.  The quality of wines was excellent.  Firstly, many of the wines that were on the list were from some of personal favourites when I lived in California.  Secondly, we loved the Petit Syrah (Bogle, California), Grenache (Languedoc/France, 2009) and Tempernillo that we tried.    The menu, which is a small, ingredient-driven menu at the moment, consists of 3-4 appies, snacks, and mains, which is set to expand as they grow.  The food was good, but I think they're still working things out.  The foie gras starter on crostinis and quince were delicious.  We tried two mains: the pork belly with octopus salad and the trout.  The pork belly and octopus was delicious.  It comes with a perfectly fried and delicious seasoned arancini (rice ball).  Better than any I've had in Italy!  The trout was pan seared and served with kale and potatoes.  It was served with a wonderful broth/sauce, but I found the fish a touch over seared.  We shared our feedback with the kitchen and they were receptive!   I must commend the service, especially considering how long they've been open.  Our server was not only friendly and efficient, but she also had a deep knowledge of wine: able to provide us with great recommendations and good pairings.  All staff members were super friendly and fun to chat with.  Honestly, typing this recommendation has made me want to drop by after work for some wine!  Eeek!  Can't wait to become an official oenophile now that Skin + Bones is open!"}
{"text":"We came for brunch but the eggs beni was sold out by 2pm  Sous vide poached eggs on a pork belly on polenta  mmmmm   We opted for the smoked hash brisket and  fried chicken   Add $3 to the entire price and you get to steal the Ploughman's buffet: Charcuterie ,  cheeses, sticky buns and raisin bread, home made granola,  fruits,  olives,  cornichons ,  and cinnamon buns and jams  I loved the red orange marmalade.   Place is very noisy so leave the kindle at home  Maybe not the place to read the new York times but the place to enjoy great food and conversation  They also brew an excellent coffee using the Chemex system..... And it's bottomless cups my fellow yelps  I gotta come back and enjoy dinner   Take a walk around the community as there are some cool independent businesses around here  UPDATE: 2016  The place is still an awesome Brunch spot but the Ploughmans Buffet option is now changed to offer a table board and a pastry board so price wise its more but its all qualit. They do not take Brunch reservations so be aware  Still highly recommended 2 years later"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with some outstanding dishes and other very good dishes. It's pretty trendy inside without being scene-y. It's at the end of the stretch of Queen East that's lined with restaurants and bars...so it avoids being overcrowded.   As you can imagine from the name, the place is stripped down but stylish. Rustic, industrial, dressed in neutrals and candlelight. The front dining room is quite small with a few windowside tables. The bar connects the restaurant to the rear dining room, and is quite long and very romantic-appearing. In the summer, the front dining room is quite preferable because the breeze and light are inspiring, but in the winter I can imagine the darker and more cozy dining area in the back (away from the door!) being more appealing. I'd go here just to sit at the bar. The collection of spirits and wine were impressively showcased in a beautiful wooden display shelf.   We went with the chef's tasting menu for $38 pp, which is kind of fun on one hand, but maybe not on the other hand if there are certain things on the menu you definitely want. Everything is priced reasonably. The tasting started out with the croquettes and kale + smoked salmon salad. Both were phenomenal. The croquettes could have used a tad more flavor, but the salad was remarkable. The amount of flavor that was infused into each bite of kale blew me away; slightly tart and also salty. Perfectly complemented the salmon. The charred green beans were next, and they probably were the highlight of the meal for me. The beans were done to perfection, with some sea salt and a small amount of smoky char on the surface. They lay on top of a romesco sauce that puzzled me with its deliciousness. Typically made from red tomatoes, Romesco has never been on my radar as a fave, but this puree was different: roasted green tomatoes, olive oil, almonds and bread crumbs were combined into a a thick sauce that was just bursting with flavor. I couldn't get over it! Definitely order this! Our next dish was the pork and ricotta meatballs. They were good. I wasn't ready to wet my pants over them like the green beans, though. The biggest letdown was the main dish - the cornish hen with serrano peppers, chorizo and corn. The chorizo and corn mix was AWESOME. The cornish hens, meh. Kind of bland themselves. I wish they'd offered us two entrees for the Chef's tasting instead of one. Dessert was sticky toffee pudding.   In all, this restaurant excels on many levels. I was excited by how unique some of the flavors were. The atmosphere hit my \"date night\" ideal on the head: casual, stylish, relaxed and full of air + light. The service was the best I've had in a long time. With a little tweaking, this place could be really awesome. Looking to go back!"}
{"text":"Was so disappointed we didn't even try the food.  I can honestly say I've never walked out of a restaraunt before even ordering a drink, so this was a first.  Came with a few people from work, had a reservation for 4.  The hostess was cranky as hell.  No smile - like we were bothering her having to be seated.  They showed us to a table right beside the front door.  The front outside door was propped open so it was quite chilly.  There were four other tables available further inside the restaraunt, so we asked if we could be moved.  The waiter was extremely rude and spoke to us like we were children.  It was not that they were not willing to move us, but rather the manner in which they spoke to us.  So, we decided that in a neighborhood full of great restaraunts we would take our business elsewhere.  Got a table just down the street at Ruby Watchco and had a delightful dinner with fabulous service."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in town. Get the buffet option add on. Great service and cool decor."}
{"text":"The surprise appetizer today was awesome!!! The cheeseboard was exceptional as well!!!!"}
{"text":"We went with friends who had eaten there before and said they had a great meal.  This time we found the food disappointing. It was ok, but nothing special. Some dishes were over cooked and dry, others, quite bland. The restaurant was half empty on a Saturday night, maybe because the food is half as good as it used to be!"}
{"text":"As a former Leslieville resident, I was excited to come back after 2 years away and see all the changes in the old 'hood. Skin + Bones is one of those changes.   Being in the former location of some kind of auto parts shop, it has a bit of an industrial feel but accented with dark wood and light paint. We were seated in the back room area in a corner banquette which was great for being able to chat. But the room itself did feel rather cavernous, although it was not loud even though most tables were occupied.  We were a party of 4 and chose the Feed Us option at $35pp. Basically the kitchen cooks what they want for you, but tapas/family style dining.  Our first course were the prosciutto croquettes; OMG! A great way to start the meal. After those came some different sausages (my apologies for not recalling the types) which were just as good as the starter.   Next up was the pan fried gnocchi and I could not get enough of that. The pork steak followed and that disappeared as quickly as the other dishes. A lemon mascarpone dessert finished the meal nicely.  Pacing of the dishes and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place offers quite the exceptional and memorable dining experience! We had the chef menu at $45/p which was well worth the money. For two, Included in our meal was 3 appetizers, 2 mains, and a desert to share. Everything was delicious and quite special in terms of presentation, taste and overall quality and originality. The pork special and ragout pasta we had were unreal. The apps were risotto balls, their special fries dish and smoked trout pâté, all of which were remarkable. They also have a great selection of wines, beers and cocktails. Their a-la-carte menu is more limited but changes regularly. Overall this is an amazing restaurant that we will be returning to."}
{"text":"I went here recently with a large group and it was lovely. The servers were all very friendly and helpful. I loved the little fired potatoes that they brought out! I ended up getting a salad because of the lack of vegetarian items but it was really tasty (lettuce topped with a big piece of cheese and honey omg so good), and it wasn't very expensive either, $10. I would go back even just for the salad! If you're a vegetarian eat before going, won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very delicious dinner all around. Best night out in a while. Octopus was to die for. As was the chocolate peanut dessert. Tried several wines - all delicious."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Skin + Bones again. I visited on a Wednesday evening with a special gentleman. We were in the mood for fun and decided on the chef's menu. It didn't disappoint. We shared a lovely bottle of an intelligent 2009 Grevey Pinot Noir. Chicken liver mousse withfried dough, charred green beans, melt-in-your-mouthrapini croquettes, steamed mussels in an exquisitely light sauce. I could not eat the main course pork and when I raised it as an issue, the manager dealt with it with grace. Our waitress, Meghan, was funny and attentive. They accommodated my food allergies without making me feel high maintenance. Service was beautifully timed, friendly and exceptionally warm. We sat in the more intimate front section and it was a perfect place and pace for a mid-week date. Even the lighting was great for its flattery factor. Thank you."}
{"text":"I like this place because it is close to my house, the decor is cool and the service is great. The food is above average but a bit on the pricey side for what it is (i.e. above average but not noteworthy).   Sunday oysters are great, as is the wine list. Sunday brunch is also good, in its above-averageness."}
{"text":"My mom, hubby and I came to this place, we were not sure about it since the menu was really small. Mom and I ordered the wild mushroom and hash and hubby eggs Benedict. When the food came wowwww we were very surprised the portion size was big and wowwwww the flavour was crazy awesome, we were all very happy with our dishes and yes we will recommend this place, you have to try it, the staff was super nice and the place is also really modern and comfortable. My husband was able to find an Argentinian drink that he really likes and is hard to find in Canada Fernet Menta, so now we are sure to come back to this place. The only thing I didn't like at all was the coffee because it was medium roast(i like dark) but my mom and hubby liked it so i guess it depends. But definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant after unsuccessfully trying to get a table at both Bonjour Brioche and Lady Marmalade (even though we still ended up waiting over 20 minutes for a table to free up for us). Well, it is what it is and it's expected that's why it's call brunch and not a quickie (for all those who complain about brunch service at restaurants being slow :P )  Anyhow, let's get down to business. This place is downright delicious! The flavours are a creative mix of the modern and classic cuisine. You will find your classics like eggs benedict, hash, pancakes..etc But they are all paired with new age twists; such as corn hash with duck confit for example. The flavours are just harmonious.  Food aside, I have to give huge shoutout to their coffee. Great coffee from Pilot Roasters! As a self proclaimed caffeine connoisseur, I really appreciate establishments that pay attention to their drinks -- after all, it is half your meal!  The atmosphere is cool and inviting with a rustic vibe. The service is attentive and polite.  The only quibble I have is the portion size in relation to their price. You don't exactly get what you pay for but then again I think I have just been spoiled by so many other brunch places in the area with mammoth portions.  Definitely a worthy brunch place among the many elite brunch establishments in the area."}
{"text":"We've been here for brunch twice with friends and we are a fan.  The Spicy Fried Chicken is incredible and I highly recommend it. The chicken is great and is served over waffles with a tangy/mustard sauce.  I also highly recommend the buttermilk pancakes but the portion is huge! It comes with 4 pancakes which are rather filling. I recommend getting it to share.   The line up is not long. Service can be slow but very friendly and helpful. The restaurant gets great light and the ambiance is welcoming. We would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday for the first time. We were extremely disappointed and will never recommend this place to anyone. The waiter had no clue about what accompanied the dishes. He spilt coffee when I asked for a refill (because I had to ask multiple times for a refill). Not to mention he was very rude and flustered. They ran out of chicken and waffles. We ordered the burger and omelette feature. The burger tasted like fish. The potato salad was undercooked and the omelette was extremely underwhelming. The only decent thing was the toast that we ordered as an extra for $4, because for some reason the omelette doesn't come with toast. The juice that we ordered came out 15 minutes after we ordered it. The people who came after us got their meal before us when we ordered first. We ordered the exact same dishes they did! No one asked if we enjoyed our meal, there was no mid-meal quality check. Overall probably the most awful brunch experience I've ever had in Toronto. Do not go here for brunch ever!!!"}
{"text":"Had the \"tasting menu\" which was well done. Nothing new or original, just well cooked food. Only food complaint would be too much butter was used. Wine list was good but overpriced. Glad we come early as the zombie apocalypse of hipsters all showed up when the sun went down."}
{"text":"I had never gone to this place but it was a suggestion that had some seriously positive reviews.  We went for Sunday brunch. I expected it to be lined up outside but I lucked out in getting a spot before some others popped in behind me right after I walked in.  The space is great. I had heard it might have once been a factory. THat being said it's still comfortable, welcoming and modern. Reminds me of space in Brooklyn called, Egg.  I went with the daily frittata special of cauliflower, zucchini and bomba chili. It was spongy, yet solid. Great spring to this. It was a flavourful yet delicate combination. The chili was not noticeable - I was kinda hoping it would be. The mixed greens with balsamic vinegar dressing complimented it well but it wasn't say spectular.    I also ordered their house made sausage which disappointed me greatly because it was a patty instead. Maybe they ran out of casing? I wish I had known it before hand. I would have probably ordered the house made bacon instead.  However, my friend ordered the S+B burger made with spicy aioli, bacon, fried egg, caramelized onion, cheddar and house made pickles plus a side of the most amazing crispy potatoes.  Loved this dish.....really wished I ordered this instead.    I can't say i would come here again for brunch but I'm curious about dinner."}
{"text":"Tasting menu is totally worth the $45! I left so full and had some amazing food! You typically need full table participation to do the tasting menu, but one of our friends was in a rush so they allowed my friend and I to do it without our third party! I liked the flexibility. Allow for 1.5 to 2 hours for the meal.   My fave dishes as the beet salad, little mushroom ball (can't remember the actual name), pork (so tender), pasta (made in house), and the toffee pudding! So so good! I think I may have named everything on the menu!   The drinks are pretty good. I liked the pink drink, but I can't remember the name of it! For some reason, i remember it being under $10!"}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars except I've never actually eaten a cooked dish here! That's right, I've been to this cool, dimly lit Leslieville resto twice, and both times I've thoroughly enjoyed what I like to call 'dinner lite'. Meaning: a dozen oysters to start (scrumptious east-coast darlings served with a perfect mignorette), a charcuterie plate, and a cheese plate. My dining companion and I share the above selections with ample beverages...and wow, I've really enjoyed my experience both times!  Tip: Sundays they offer HALF PRICE BOTTLES OF BUBBLY. You're welcome :)"}
{"text":"Omg, what a surprise! This restaurant wasn't my first choice, but I came in and very glad that I went to check it out.  First,  we ordered the dessert plate which has 9 pieces of home-made dessert. Everything tastes amazing!!! Good bakery!  My friend ordered the chicken waffle, she loved it! I ordered the egg benny, I loved it! The portion is big, we were so full at the end."}
{"text":"Solid brunch place with great service. We just sat at the bar and had a quick brunch meal, but it was still quite good. Ordered the Eggs Benedict and Mushrooms on Toast. Eggs Benny had a really great hollandaise sauce, but wish they added a little more. Everything else was great and would definetly come back again - for both brunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Meh! Family style? Left hungry! No one leaves any house in my family hungry! Ran out of bread! One small mushroom risotto ball, potato chips with hummus, trout pate (really fishy) with flat bread, small bowl of pasta with a sprinkle of sausage, small pork chop 1/2 fat with a \"few\" roasted vegetables and kernels of corn. Wow they made a lot of money from us for very little return. This was shared between 2 with 6 in our party. Service was great! Too many good places in the area to go back here."}
{"text":"Most exquisite meal of my life.  My husband and I did the \"Let Us Feed You\" option - where the cook prepares the four course dinner for you - and wow, we were so glad we did.  Some of the highlights - the lick off the plate good sauce that was served underneath seared crunchy green beans, this AMAZING beet, citrus, cheese and mint salad, the perfectly cooked steak for our main course, the amazing caramel bread pudding for dessert with this perfectly pillowy dollop of whipped cream topping. Everything was tied together with mint too which we thought was a unique way of tying all the dishes.   I wish I would have taken photos because the meal looked as good as it tasted, but trust me you won't be disappointed if you come here. The food is fresh, inventive and delicious. We loved everything they served us and it way exceeded our expectations!"}
{"text":"Went as a group on a calm evening (only a few other people in the bar) and we had a few issues:  - Several wines on the menu were not in stock, I can understand one but three? Is it unreasonable to expect a wine bar to keep their menu in stock?  - Cheese plate was adequate, oysters were average, desserts were sub-par compared to any chain such as Jack Astor's or Milestones. Prices for everything except the cheese seemed high for the quality and quantity.  - Service was unbearably slow and inaccurate.  Waiter was too nervous to approach people and several people in the group had to get up or flag someone else down to be served and it was not a crowded night. No other staff bothered the help and even the manager was almost reluctant to approach us.  - The group was never asked if we were finished or wanted additional wines, they simply took the menus away.   - Eventually, when the lack of service became so unbearable, the manager was contacted and even he spent ~30 minutes trying to sort the bills out properly and did not even apologise for the service."}
{"text":"Sad to say my third visit wasn't quite as good as the first two.   Some changes were made to the menu, which I'd usually say is a good thing (I like it when restos change up their menu semi-frequently), but in this case some of the existing menu items had been modified in ways that removed elements that originally made the dishes shine. The trout no longer featured the fried diver clams that really made the dish outstanding, the celeriac gnocchi didn't include the uni bottarga anymore and the revamped beef tartare didn't do it for me.  The steak dish we had was tasty and I was glad to see seasonal fiddleheads included in the dish, but the shrimp salad that replaced the marinated squid noodles (which I had been hoping to try!) on the menu was a disappointment - over-dressed and under-shrimped.  The service was still impeccable as always though and they are running some good \"happy hour\" specials (free amuse-bouches from 5 to 6 p.m. weekdays, and $1 oysters and half-price bottles of sparkling wine all day Sunday) and for those reasons I'll be back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is one of my favorite places for dinner in Toronto. However, I went for brunch today and was very disappointed. There was a wider selection of specialty cocktails than brunch menu items. Unfortunately, there were no healthy options."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious! Mixed greens, beef tartare, cucumber risotto, duck breast, sticky toffee pudding... yum! Servings were reasonably generous as well. Lots of wines (including 4 sparkling) by the glass (3 oz, 6 oz) and bottle. Did not have any \"WOW\" pairings despite being asked for help, but all glasses were solid and went smoothly with the dishes. Space is large and funky, warm and pleasant. Servers were good as well. Courses were a bit slow in coming but for me this was a welcome change as I find a lot of places rush the courses. I see that they have half price bottles of champagne and $1 oysters on Sundays too."}
{"text":"I hosted a 19 person prix fixe Bachelorette here on a Saturday night. Everyone was thrilled. The bride even slurred is this Michelin starr?\" I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a perfect evening here with my boyfriend. We sat at the bar, and were well taken care of. The ambience is the best there is in Toronto. The bartenders make a delicious vermouth, great selection of flavors too. We shared the croquettes, aioli peppers, sourdough, and gnocchi - all were delicious! For dessert, we had the toffee pudding - AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant does sharing plates without compromising the feeling of a dinning out experience (I loathe \"family style\" meals that I could make myself at home). Their \"let us feed you\" menu is affordable at $40 each, and they'll pair wine with it if you ask and work around your dietary preferences. Make sure to start with one of their great cocktails. Their wine menu changes frequently and always has some unique picks. Once on a slow night we asked the server to pour us blind 2 oz tastings and she was totally into the fun of us guessing the wines. Note the restaurant has an industrial style, which looks super cool but also makes it pretty loud (open concept, lots of concrete), so if your'e in a big group, make sure every one is a loud talker!"}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to check out Skin+Bones and I was surprisingly disappointed.   A friend and I started with the prosciutto croquettes, which were delicious. These little guys definitely left us wanting more.   The big disappointer was the pan fried gnocchi that both of us got. This main tasted mostly like burnt garlic with far more cauliflower than gnocchi. The portion size was small, which still left us hungry.  We finished with the sticky toffee pudding complete with bone marrow caramel & vanilla chantilly cream. Good stuff. But if I'm comparing STP in Leslieville, I have to hand it to Ceili Cottage down the street. By far the best STP I've had in Toronto.   I hate to say it, but I ended up grabbing a slice of pizza later that night to fill the gap.  On the plus side, the wine was fantastic and our server was excellent."}
{"text":"love it here. hands down, delicious food, great service, really cool restaurant and you`re actually full at the end. despite the pricey menu, it was well worth it. great for anniversaries and special occasions. my wife and i did the chef`s menu and every single item was amazing. looking forward to eating here again soon."}
{"text":"If liquor didn't have any alcohol in it would anyone care for giving it so much attention? This place has huge swaths of bottled grape drink everywhere, some sitting in special refrigerated units, replete with red lights and shiny aluminum cases. Special taps decant the brew into glasses so one never has to -god forbid- touch the bottles! A healthy selection of everything you could imagine in wine. The staff are eager to please but they all wear the same shirts with the restaurants name emblazoned on them, and maybe that's ok but this is not Kelsey's! The lack of other frosty delights is limited to 5 beers and cocktails (each).  The food although tasty is not a great place to go if one is hungry as you'd end up going back for thirds.  The art is recycled minimalist. There is a silly chalk drawing on the street as you enter that gives off the impression they are on the verge of going under."}
{"text":"The Duchess and I had a delightful dinner last night at Skin+Bones. Fabulous staff, delicious apps, wonderfully prepared main course. And Lugtread on tap!  Very reasonably priced for fresh quality food. Highly recommended.   Returned with friends recently because we wanted them to see what we experienced before. This time disappointed! I ordered the pork chop again but this time it was not a chop but just cut up pieces. No  Lugtread on tap. They no longer carry it? Tried another beer but I got the last one so couldn't have another. Menu was virtually the same as a year before. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"The food here is simply out of this world.   I went with a group of 5 and we ordered the \"Let us feed you!\" suprise prix fix. One of the people in my party requested to have the octopus as one of the courses as she was really looking forward to trying it and they accomodated this happily.  It was a ton of food for $35 and we all left stuffed to the gills and very happy. The cocktail selection is also fantastic and the service was great as well.  I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food and a comfortable atmosphere. What a gem in Leslieville! And the space is surprisingly BIG!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable and well executed \"let us feed you\" 4-course tasting menu for $45 - which I thought was good value.  Was pleasantly surprised that most of it was off menu. The 1st course was a trio of appetizer plates, followed by a hefty portion of their very good house-cured gravlax, then a big slab of melt-in-the-mouth beef short rib on a extremely tasty faro 'risotto'.  Service was smooth and unobtrusive.  Would happily return."}
{"text":"One of the most satisfying casual restaurant experiences we've had in the city.   A truly perfect combination of food and wine.     Ashley, our sommelier, suggested a fantastic Bordeaux bottle that we hadn't heard of.   In order to allow us to compare a few options, she prepared blind tastings that allowed us to hone our selection to something perfect.    It didn't hurt that the price point ended up being awesome.      Everything that we ordered was superb.   It's not a word I use lightly.   We expected very little, and were totally blown away.  This was 5-star service and excellent unexpected takes on modern cuisine.       Amongst the dishes we particularly enjoyed were the Pork Steak and the Zucchini Salad.     The unstuffy atmosphere and chill ambiance really helped make for an excellent evening in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to spot for wine in the east end. The food keeps getting better and more interesting every time I come back. The chef/cooking staff's passion really shows in their work. The wine list is constantly adapting and very comprehensive. They use the same source as Scaramoush, so you can trust me when I say it is the real deal. Every time I go to this place I not only have a good meal paired with interesting wine, I have a full-blown dining experience."}
{"text":"My first experience here in 2014 was better. When I ate there last night I had a more average experience.   The meatball app was great. We also had the duck confit agnolotti which was decent but the steak was average at best and at 30$ I expected more.   The service was pretty good. Wine and drinks overpriced. Either inflation has really hit or Skin and Bones didn't deliver value this time.   In any case I used to rave about this place. Now I feel underwhelmed by the most recent experience."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed with this restaurant. I have heard this restaurant had a Sunday special for oysters so I decided to try it. I made a reservation for 5 people prior to coming here. When arriving they couldn't find our reservation in the system so they sat us at the bar while the host and the manager sort out stuff. Luckily enough, one person from our group couldn't come, so they had a table that was available. The catch was they had a reservation for that table in a hour and was expected to finish at that time. Was kinda turned off by this.   After being seated, the waitress told us the specials they had. We were were only allowed to order a maximum of 12 oysters per person. This was kind of disappointing because we only came here for the oysters. We then ordered the maximum allotment. The oysters were really good and was very impressed with the sauce that came with it.   After finishing our meal, the manager asked us how our meal was and asked if we wanted anything else. We said no and asked for the bill. He was slightly disappointed and made alot of passive aggressive remarks to us. After my group paid and was leaving the waitress said \"see you next week, probably not tho.\" Which was very rude. It was the worst restaurant experience I had in a while.   **Note to management - If messing up a reservation, act professional and own up to your mistake. Not throw them at a random table and rush them. Also expect customers  to order from daily specials on the menu and if they don't order anything else don't act rude towards them. You and your staffs snobby, pretentious attitude is unessacary and very unwelcoming. Please educate yourself on manners and basic customer service principles"}
{"text":"Came out here to Toronto for the weekend from NY. Was directed to this chic place by a local from the area.   We were seated within 5 minutes (party of 5). The waitress and hostess were both charming and attentive.   4 of the 5 of us ordered the chicken and waffle platter. I tried it with Cole slaw (which is the original form) along with a side of green salad. Delicious, the Cole slaw adds another layer of taste to the three layered meal (waffle with maple syrup at the bottom, coleslaw in the middle and the chicken on top).   The other person ordered the red velvet pancakes, they look very good and he did not complain.   My only complaint is that the waffle could have been more crispy, aside from that. Very pleased with the meal."}
{"text":"I moved from Los Angeles 2 months ago. Leslieville has become my destination as of late, and I've visited this establishment 3 times just within an span of 2 weeks. Yes, I'm slightly addicted to Skin+Bones. Professional and friendly service; Cassandra (sorry if I'm spelling your name wrong!) is fun and a great guide to choosing a good wine for your evening. According to my oenophilia husband this place has a good wine selection. I love their $1 oysters on Sundays. (Shhhh, should I tell?!!) Our evening consisted of 2 Cavas, a dozen oysters, the cheeseboard, and the terrine; the plates may appear small, but boy, my tummy was happy and my taste buds satisfied. Daniel the owner is very friendly and knowledgeable.   Good food, good people, good vibe. It's a nice splurge for any day of the week!  PS: If you care to know, the restaurant's name, \"Skin+Bones\" refers to the skin of the grapes and the structure (bone) of the wine. When I first heard the name I was thinking sinew and marrow. Totally off :)"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant - everything from the food/wine list to the service (which was outstanding) to the ambiance and decor... This was my ideal place to eat out...  I have tried the following dishes and would recommend them all:  Morgon Côte du Py Potel-Aviron 2010 Charcuterie Board  Seared Scallops Roasted Bone Marrow Crab Apple Glazed Pork Belly  'Nice touches' to mention: They offer free samplers before 7pm and serve complimentary mineral and/or sparkling water."}
{"text":"Great scones and good service. Meal was delicious and our waitress was very nice. Went for brunch and got the burger, everything about it was delicious, one of the best I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's really a 4.5 star - with the slight discount off due to its limited menu choices.  The restaurant is in the heart of Leslieville in one of the hippest part of town. The cocktails are done very well, especially their selection of Vermouth! The food is done quite well, with portions that are just short of heavy so you're yearning for more. This is a great spot to bring a date or to kick it with a few friends and have drinks. The decor is relaxing and casual, with comfortable seating and high ceiling."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch based on some top ten lists and reviews I read and frankly because they took reservations. It was one of those weekends that I just didn't feel like standing in line. Ends up we wouldn't have needed a reservation anyway because there were a few tables available when we walked in.  First they have good coffee so they won me over immediately. They also were quickly on hand when refills were needed. We also ordered the pastry plate to share. I hesitated because I don't eat that much pastry and it was only two of us. I did not regret the decision (although we did just take almost the whole thing home). I tried the buffalo yogurt granola for breakfast and was not super taken with it. My dining partner had the chicken and waffles, which he declared delicious (but perhaps a bit heavy on the 5-spice powder). The side of bacon we ordered was fine. It was just bacon so you can't go wrong, but somehow I thought they would have extra good bacon ...   With so many brunch options in the city (or even in this neighborhood), it wouldn't be my first choice but it is a good decent brunch."}
{"text":"Holy crap, so good! I think it would be one of my favourite meals of 2013. Every course was fantastic and great service.   Found and booked on Open Table.   We got there during \"snack hour\" which offers half price on a bunch of cocktails, etc  Started with a charcuterie board that was very tasty! But the scallops on ginger infused watermelon was outstanding. I could eat 16 orders of that. They have a bit of peanut chili oil, some crushed peanuts and coriander. Soooooo gooooood!! My main was the crab apple glazed pork belly which was cooked perfectly, and my girlfriend had the hangar steak which looked pretty on the plate.  Definitely stopping by here again! Their proximity to Atomic Toybot excites me as well (next door)"}
{"text":"Pretty bland food.  A couple of the dishes tasted like each other. The one thing that really stood out was the wine list. 3oz or 5oz pours! Are the days gone for pouring a proper glass of wine.    Service was good."}
{"text":"This place is gets it done right. Food is great -Best pork chop I've had in a long time. Excellent service from a staff working hard to impress and look the part too. All Wearing smart looking denim and leather aprons that project a sense of \"I'm here to work and serve my craft.\"  Came here on a Friday night (spontaneous) with wife and toddler and was greeted with a smile. Then promptly shown to our table in the massive and yet cozy feeling dining room in the back. Finally a place with space in the east end. Add to that, awesome 20 ft high ceilings remaining from what I recall was an auto parts warehouse prior to becoming this gem.   I would highly recommend the tasting menu. My only suggestion for the restaurant is to ask the diners if there is something on the menu they really want or need; aka some pasta for our kid. They did send over potato bites once they noticed our child wasn't eating.   I love the wave of bars and restaurants crashing into queen east and Skin and Bones has found the right balance of fun casual, meets elegant executed dining. Bottom line, Support this place. It's good."}
{"text":"I want to like this place so badly but unfortunately it only gets by with 3 stars.  I've been here on 3 separate occasions and on all those counts, my experience and food have been just mediocre - nothing to rave about at all.  Take the wine away from the equation and all we have is a menu that has no identity - when we asked the server if this was French inspired food, he stammered that it was more Mediterranean with French fusion and some Asian inspiration...huh?  Sure, some of the dishes are worth mentioning - the Branzino is delicious and so are the scallops but nothing that would make me come back again. Even the \"free snacks\" between 5-7 are pretty lame. I would call it a nibble more than a snack, they are so miniscule."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner yesterday (Fri night). BEFORE: Called ahead to make a reservation as I had heard it can get busy. But they open the rear section on weekends so there was both tables for two as well as seating at the bar. We chose the latter (bar).  We were able to get street parking right in front easily.   UPON ARRIVAL: They took our coats and gave us a coat check number -an unexpected and classy touch.  I enjoyed sitting at the bar (my only suggestion would be that they add hooks for women's purses under the bar).   Chris seated us and ran through the specials with us. The menu is small but like the other reviewers have said, everything tastes good as long as you eat meat.   My friend ordered a negroni to drink as he said the last time they were really good if you like bitter cocktails.   FOOD: We shared a beef tongue appetizer. I had never has beef tongue before and it was delicious! It has thin slices of pickled pear and jalapeños and the beef was thinly sliced and had the perfect balance of texture and taste.   For my main I ordered the steak bavette and my dining partner ordered the gnocchi. Both were perfection although I was a bit disappointed by the green sauce that came with the steak. Another reviewer had said it paired perfectly with the steak but I didn't find that it enhanced the steaks flavor. Overall the steak was a generous portion (not too big or small) and was cooked to medium rare perfection. And the bed of mushrooms it comes on are lovely.   The gnocchi had a subtle kick to it which we loved and it almost melted in your mouth. There was a delicious cheese crumbled on top. But my friend was slightly hungry after finishing his so he has a piece or two of my steak.   For dessert we ordered the sticky toffee pudding and it did not disappoint. We were fighting Over the last bite ;-)   AMBIENCE: Loved it. It was dimly lit and even though we were sitting at the bar it felt intimate. I really enjoyed the music and the volume, it added to the laid back but cool atmosphere. Quite the eclectic crowd....all generations.   STAFF:  The staff were very attentive from the moment we walked in. I didn't realize I had dropped my napkin on the ground and another staff member brought me a new one without me even asking.   Great place to go on a date night.   I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  VIBE  Can we talk about Skin + Bones? Because we need to talk about Skin + Bones. From the Danforth, you are not even a 15 minute bus ride to Queen and Carlaw;  it's literally right at the bus stop. SCORE. Decor and service are sophisticated but unassuming. The service is spot-on and the servers are so friendly. Although, I guess I did feel a bit out of place with my converse in the crowd (but it wasn't that bad since it wasn't too busy). It was the little things that the servers did - gave me an amuse and free sparkling water, explained the menu items in detail and just talked to me (It wasn't busy and I'd recommend going early in the evening) that really set them apart.   I like the fact that you can have a full dinner here or just come and chill out at the bar and have a glass of wine or a snack.   I ATE//DRANK I knew I should have written this down but I had the Sauvignon and the Pinot Noir. Both pretty light but still packed a punch.  The raves about the cripsy fried chicken tails are also en point. They are the perfect bar snack, especially if you like salt. the potatoes that come with the tails are nicely seasoned. They don't skimp on the snack portions either.   I had the Perth Pork Belly with arancini and octopus salad. At first, I felt like the items were disjointed but they really worked well together. The pork belly was succulent; the bacon added a crispy layer to the texture and flavour of the dish. The fried arancini was a big portion and the octopus salad gave the dish a nice, acidic touch. I would definitely recommend this dish.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Make no bones about it - this place is a really nice addition to Leslieville. It's a great location and a trendy restaurant that is going to make the west-enders cross over to the bridge. The nabe really needed an option like this. Well done guys!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service. Sunday right at 10am there was an empty dining room that quickly filled up. Ate the beef hash with a side of bacon and it was delicious. Great atmosphere and a very good experience."}
{"text":"It's a sunny Saturday morning and everyone is out lining up at their favourite brunch resto in Leslieville.  Skin and Bones wasn't our plan A, in fact, it wasn't even our Plan B!  We ended up here because our top choices had line ups that looks like a min hr wait so Skin and Bones was a no brainer.   I bookmarked skin and Bones for dinner so i was happy to give their brunch a try. The ambience is good, very spacious with modern, clean decor. The prices are very fair, ranging $13 - $16 and you will see the usually breakfast suspects like egg Benny and fried chicken with waffle.   I ordered the mushroom on toast with poach eggs and the Mr. got the breakfast special. My poached eggs were way over cooked but they replaced it right away, so that wasn't a problem. The only other complaint I have is my salad were drenched in dressing. Overall, It's not the best tasting brunch I had but it was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I contacted Lisa Clarke by e-mail about my interest in booking a reservation and she quickly got back to me. This was an awesome first start because I am really not a fan of the telephone (once upon a time I used to work as a clinical counselor and I had to speak to clients on the phone--had enough phone interaction to last me a life time!) Lisa stated that for groups of 8 or more we had to go with their Brunch Feasting Menu. Further, all the menu items were going to be served on boards and platters, shared by the whole table. The menu would cost $25/ adult plus $3 if we wanted to add the Ploughman's Buffet.  So how was it?  Phenomenal! I was worried that there would not be enough food. Yes, I know that the Ploughman's Buffet was all-you-can-eat, but from the pictures I had seen online, it did not seem like there were a lot of options. Wrong!  Here is the breakdown of the awesomeness (ok, cheesy--but it was awesome!):  The service was impeccable. They never let our coffee or water reach the 25% mark. They were always on point refilling our drinks. I forgot how nice it feels to not have to chase staff down for more coffee or water.  Our table did not lack food. They did not want any of us to get up and walk over to the buffet table (which at first annoyed me to be honest), but they made sure they brought it all to us in platters to pass around among us. The staff would come around and ask, \"is there anything else you would like me to get for you? Would you like more cold cuts? I see you are low on cheddar, would you like some more?\"  We were not rushed. I thought we would have a limited time with the buffet before we got our hot dishes, but no, they let us lead and choose the pace. So we did what most people want to do when they are having brunch on a Sunday afternoon--have a chill leisurely experience with friends while enjoying good food. In this case, an array of delicious food options.  The food options seemed endless. Specially when you discovered that certain cheeses went great with certain jams. I am certain I annoyed my guests with all my experimentation, but seriously, after I shoved some of my experiments in their mouths, they agreed! It was good!  Before the mains came out, the staff asked what they could take away. This was huge for me because I hate when we are still eating, and plates are removed without permission or inquiry. This happens a lot when it is all-you-can-eat. Not here. I got to hold on to some cheese and the bread pudding--aww that sinfully good bread pudding (I took a piece home with me. Shhh don't tell anyone).  Holy mother of God! The mains! They weren't kidding when they called it a FEAST! We did not know where to put the platters! We had to make \"Tetris-like\" moves to make it all fit.  Fried chicken: moist, tender, well-balanced spices, crispy exterior, a little too fatty in some parts, but then that is what some of my guests loved about it. Overall, it was pretty damn good.  Potato salad: not many people had it because it was under the chicken, which was great for me because I took it home as left-overs and I just ate it for dinner. It was delicious. I specially liked the dill.  Pancakes: Lisa was not kidding when she said that they make some of the best pancakes in Toronto. The pancakes were served with Chantilly cream, strawberries and butter. Heavenly.  Pulled Porchetta eggs Benny: someone remarked on how perfect the Hollandaise sauce was. The only flaw was that I thought the pork needed a little bit more seasoning.  Bacon: someone stated that it was the best bacon they have ever had. Hard to disagree.  Crispy potatoes: I ate a whole bowl (there were several thank God!). No joke. Crispy exterior with a fluffy interior and homemade ketchup. Oh yeah, I devoured them.  Dropping one star because....  ADDENDUM: Returned to Skin+Bones for brunch, but this time we did not do the feast, but instead we ordered from the menu. This is how the experience differed...  1. Your meal does not come with a side.   2. The Ploughman's buffet will change for every brunch. I was really looking forward to the bread pudding which they had the last time I was there, and this time it was not available.  3.  In less than two weeks they changed the price from $3 to $5. However, if you do not add the Ploughman's buffet, I really doubt that you will get full on just the main.  BREAKDOWN: $12 FOR PANCAKES (ONE OF 2 CHEAPEST ITEMS ON THEIR MENU) $6 FOR POTATOES $3 FOR COFFEE $5 FOR THE PLOUGHMAN'S BUFFET ______________________ $26 BEFORE TAXES AND TIP  (SUBTOTAL) $33.28 WITH TAX AND TIP (IF YOU WERE TIPPING 15%)  The food is still awesome, but just keep the differences in mind. :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot. Nice atmosphere. Small menu that doesn't seem to change (I've been there twice and it was the same both times but they were within a 2 or 3 month span), and some items were a bit disappointing but overall a pretty decent place if you're nearby in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I've come to Skin+Bones twice, once for dinner and once for appetizers, drinks and buck-a-shuck. I won't lie, we initially thought it always looked very empty while walking by, and thought that must speak to the quality. Boy oh boy, were we wrong.   The appetizers expedition was very soon after S+B had opened, so I won't speak to that visit. But the dinner just a few nights ago was a very pleasant surprise. Rather than sitting in the front area like we had the first time, we were seated back in the dining room. When you first walk in, it's a very \"wow\" moment. The detail in the lighting, table size and placement and intimacy was very impressive.   The ambience is lively, and the music is a bit loud (although that may be due to natural echo in the large dining room. It seemed okay in the front) and very modern. Lighting in the back is low, while the front and bar have great natural light.   I had the whole Branzino, which came with capers, parsley, cucumber and fennel. Literally to die for. The fish was cooked to perfection... I have literally had dreams about it since. I definitely recommend giving it a try, because I have certainly never eaten a whole fish (sans head) in under 10 minutes before... but it was JUST. THAT. GOOD.   The drink menu is spot-on, with great craft beers and an excellent wine list. My next visit will be specifically to try some of the specialty cocktails on the menu. There are also great Sunday specials which I highly recommend checking out. Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"Great environment. The let us feed you option is special but I don't like some of the dishes. I think it would be better to just order exactly what i want. However, it's still a fun expensive"}
{"text":"Our party of four had the chef's menu for $45 per head. We got three appetizers, a pasta course, flat iron steak as main and toffee pudding as desert. Presentation and service was very nice and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Skin + Bones, you make my heart sing. After a couple of bad runs at some of Toronto's popular restaurants we came here, and thank goodness we did. On the East side, away from mediocre hipster spots, sits Skin + Bones. It's charming in design and even better in taste. I'm sick of trendy places, serving heavy food, centered around pork belly or some other fad food. Here you can find complexity. Focus on produce and freshness. And most importantly, the lost art of Balance. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Despite the minor flaw that I will explain, this was a good dining experience.  I would give it a 4.5.  The restaurant is very attractive.  The industrial ceilings are high and there is ample room between tables.  All of the hard surfaces bounce noise a bit, so it was loud but conversation was possible.  We sat at a very long table right in front of the kitchen.  I enjoyed watching the guys preparing dishes.  The only drawback about this vantage was the light in the kitchen is very bright which is a little distracting and hard on the eyes since the dining room is very dim.  There seemed to be a ton of staff working.  We were never waiting long to have our water refilled, but it did seem to take quite a while to get our main dishes.  While waiting for our apps, our server brought us over a complimentary dish - trout on chicken skin.  Interesting; not a fan myself, but I could appreciate the contrast of textures.  When the apps arrived, one of our group members found a shard of hard plastic in her crositini.  We informed the waiter who promptly returned with another staff member, I assume the manager.  He was very apologetic and offered to replace the dish or comp it.  Accidents happen, but what I did like was his handling of the situation.  I give him props for his honest concern.  Meanwhile, I ordered a glass of Lacrima di Morro d'Alba Luigi Giusti 2009.  Honestly, the floral bouquet smelled like perm solution to me and I did not enjoy this wine.  I say this not because it is a fault of the restaurant, but because I would avoid ordering that particular wine.  The wine list is reasonable and there are many other choices.  In the end, everyone enjoyed their meals.  Having had a large lunch, I had the beef tartare for my main.  It was appropriately rich and the serving size was perfect.  I had a chance to sample a few of the other dishes such as the salad and the chicken tail and everything was interestingly flavored.  The final consensus among the group was this restaurant is a success."}
{"text":"The beef tongue is amazing.   Drinks were fantastic!   Not a very large restaurant so it felt a little crowded. But the food was worth it!  Nicole"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place through the rave reviews on yelp and made me want to try this place so much and I finally did give it a try today! I arrived at the restaurant around 7pm today and was greeted and seated promptly.   For the apps me and my friend ordered Grilled  octopus and grilled beef tongue along with 6 oysters ($1 each special!). The beef tongue absolutely blown my mind away. It was very flavorful and not overly chewy. The spices inside really brought out the flavor of the meat. As for the octopus, it was cooked perfectly.  Not overly chewy and very tender! It came with a sauce which contained chickpeas inside. Not a big fan of it.  As for the mains, I ordered the bavette steak and house made gnocchi. I must tell you that the gnocchi was definitely one of the best, if not the best in Toronto  as far as I've had so far. The beef steak was extremely delicious. I ordered it a little more raw than medium rare and got it perfectly done! The salsa verde that came along with it was absolutely amazing. Really brought out the flavor of the juicy beef.   Overall, this place absolutely went over my expectations. I would definitely come back and try every other items on the menu and also the $38 per person 4 course tasting menu!"}
{"text":"Okay, so it took me ages to give Skin and Bones another chance. And OMG my dinner was perfection! I went with a couple of colleagues from Montreal and Halifax; they wanted a restaurant that was going to be interesting, intimate (so we could have a conversation with out screaming at each other), with good food. S&B delivered on all accounts. Wonderful staff, we weren't rushed, food was timed perfectly. I still dream of the grilled octopus, Cornish hen (the succotash with bacon is perfect), gnocchi, and short rib. Everyone's food looked so good, we had to start passing forks around. This is going to be my \"Go to\" restaurant on Sunday night from now on."}
{"text":"If you go here know the wine isn't cheap but very nice and you MUST do the $35 blind menu  They basically just feed you It's great value, everything is fresh  You of course can tell them your allergies but probably easiest if you have none It was supposed to be 3 courses but felt like much more! The appetizer course was broke down into many small plates of stuffed peppers, little sausages etc The main was a hen or poultry on fresh peas in jus. It was awesome, I don't even like peas but I liked theirs. The dessert was lovely too.  You get full and happy without having to ask a million questions about the menu. No worrying what to order. Very cool. I've been several times, anywhere with prosecco or cava, I'm there."}
{"text":"This restaurant was quite unique. It was very spacious, they didn't attempt to fill in the space with more tables and chairs and the food was really good. Great wine and beer selection and cocktails were very tasty. The only complaint I would have was that the dishes came out pretty slow. There was a good wait between dishes. But the staff was nice and friendly. If you're looking for a place to enjoy good food with great friends...a low key kinda night where no one is in a rush, this would be a good place for drinks and chilling. If you are in a hurry, then I wouldn't recommend this place"}
{"text":"This review of Skin+Bones is based on my brunch experience.  Poached eggs over French lentils and mushrooms - Good Fried Chicken  - meh I found the batter a little too heavy for my liking but the side potato salad was really good!  Ploughman's buffet did look good! And for a few dollar extra on top of the main, great option if you are a bigger eater.  Service here was excellent and attentive. I just wish I enjoyed the food a little more.  Maybe I need to come back for dinner and give Skin+Bones another try. The \"Let Us Feed You\" does sounds good! And of course Sunday Oysters ($1)  and Drink Special!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, \"Buck a Shuck Oyster Sundays!\"  YES!!  My wife and I ordered the tasting menu with a dozen fresh oysters added on.  Every course was great.  But, the stand out was the short rib entree, awesome!  Just such a tender and flavourful meal.  The wait staff was attentive and very friendly.  Definitely will be returning.  Thanks for the great meal."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here were great! Every dish we had was fantastic.    The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The sticky toffee pudding was moist and light.  The only reason I gave it a 4 our of 5  was because the food came out a little slow.  But overall great place highly recommend everyone to come here and have a great time."}
{"text":"We had an (embarrassingly) early dinner the other night; three of us. We all went with appies, and I have to say they were terrific. My chicken mousse came with 6 or 8 little pillows of pastry that were a perfect accompaniment. I also had a salad with spicy sausage that was delicious. We will definitely be back to further explore the menu."}
{"text":"Took about 15 of my co-workers here for our quarterly team event and came away thoroughly impressed. We did the tasting menu and there was something for everyone - they even managed to accommodate the one vegan we had with us, without sacrificing options for other people.  Meal started out with oysters, followed by pickled veg, olives & charcuterie plate. After that I particularly liked the beef tartare, which came out as a mountain on the little butcher blocks they serve the small plates on - was incredibly delicious and generously portioned. Main course was a brisket w/salsa verde accompanied by stewed carrots and some crispy fried potatoes. I've heard that their normally fried in duck fat (um, yes please) but this time just in oil because we had a vegan with us (damn you vegans!)  Service was great, especially since there were so many of us - pretty sure everyone always had their drinks filled/re-filled and they kept the food coming at a steady clip, but not stacking it up on the table.  I'd definitely recommend going as a group and doing the tasting menu as we did. I'm sure it changes often, but judging from this night the chefs really know what they're doing."}
{"text":"My partner and I tried couple of appetizers and we were blown away by all of the dishes. Can't wait to be back and try their main courses   And so we went back for a proper dinner and the quality was consistent. For mains we had the pork and gnocchi which were both just mouth watering. We also had a repeat of the lengua and tried the croquets and the beans. All were hmmmm.  Service was very attentive...and crazy how it seems that they remembered us!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Have been here for brunch and dinner and both were fantastic. Sometimes I have random cravings/dreams for the chicken liver mousse.  It is that good."}
{"text":"Skin + Bones (@skinandbonesto) is another great addition to the already great Leslieville's dinning scene. From Daniel Clarke and Harry Wareham, alum of Pizza Libretto and Enoteca Sociale together with Chef Matthew Sullivan (@GastroMatthew) formerly Malena, L'Unita & Boxed; I can expect but great things and I was definitely not disappointed.   Love the long bar seating extending all the way to the back, I just love how the fridge light shine through below and with the expose brick wall and minimalist look, it was definitely my type of restaurant but was a lot more spacious than usual (no bumping into your neighbor).... Love it here  It was a much larger space than I expected, seeing the big table by the kitchen I can't help but regretted of not having my Birthday here since I have been looking everywhere for a restaurant that I like which can accommodate the 16 of us.  I read somewhere how Chef Sullivan created each dish with a specific type of wine in mind, so I was surprise at that there wasn't wine pairing on the menu and our waiter didn't suggest it either. But the wine-list do consist of a lot of variety of wines, with a lot from lesser know region and variety.   Cabernet Sauvignon Waterstone 2009, Napa Valley, California $ 79.00   They bake their own bread in house, served fresh and hot; we ate our first basket of bread in no time and even had second. The outside was so crispy and so moist inside.  Their Menu is devided into 3 parts: Snack, Apps & Mains (+ sides) And we order 2 of each, which was piratically almost half the menu.  Crispy Chicken Tails $8 ~ w/ potato salad ~ Just had to get this since it was highly recommended by a few fellow foodies... This was so good, very flavorful and just a tad salty and I can see myself pairing this with a beer or a crisp light white     Salt Cured Foie Gras $11 ~ Preserved Quince, Brioche and \" L'Effet Papillon\" Raw Honeydew ~ I can't believe I'm going to say this but this was my least favorite dish of the night cause I always say \"anything foie gras is good\" but it was really nothing special, forgettable even... .   Nova Scotian Smelt Escabache $14 ~ Braised Swiss Chard, Lemon, Fennel, Crispy Garlic ~ It was just perfect looking as it was perfect tasting, every component of this dish complimented each other both flavor and texture wise. Love how the deep fried the fish bones which not only added the crispy texture but very flavorful as well.   Rhode Island Marinated Squid Noodles $14 ~ \"Soiled Reputation\" Baby Romaine, Buttermilk and Brandade Vinaigrette, jalapeno & Olives ~ The flavors are more subtle here but somehow everything works together in such a harmony. ~ Thought the squid noodle would be somehow tougher but it was very soft and tender.   Roasted Perth Pork Belly & Octopus Salad $18 ~ Roasted Bone Marrow Arancini, Marinated Radish & Parsley ~ Where most places would cook/braised the pork belly to a soft melt in your mouth goodness, I was surprise at how this still have the texture with the crispy seared outer layer which gave you a bit bite.... just love the change for once. ~ Somehow when I read the menu, I can't see how the octopus salad would go with the fatty pork belly but somehow it works, the tartness just sort of balance it out. The bone marrow in the arancini gave it a extra sticky and gooyee texture with plenty of flavor even without any of the usual stuffing.    Beef Cheek Bourguignon $ 23 ~ Sunchokes, Perth Bacon, Roasted Mushroom and Red Wine Onions ~ Good, so good, very good..... melt in your mouth good! Everything we had that night was beyond my expectation. I really can't choose my favorite which is a first    Chemex Coffee ~ Los Rosas $2.5    Sticky Toffee Pudding $6 ~ Bone Marrow Caramel & Vanilla Chantilly Cream ~ omg, my favorite warm ooey gooey dessert and this time there was fatty yummy bone marrow added to it. Just to die for     Brioche Donuts $6 ~ caramelized White Chocolate ~ I am not a big fan of white chocolate since it's way too sweet but there was only 2 dessert on the menu, so we just ordered both. Surprisingly it wasn't that sweet given that I am not sure how you caramelized chocolate but this was good. Made fresh, it was very spongy and not heavy at all.   Verdict : ~ Love everything here and can't wait to come back to try the rest of the menu ~ Somehow after all these food, we were not overly full and felt very satisfied (unlike a lot of other places where the food felt so heavy, good but very heavy) ~ Great service, Great Winelist & Great Food"}

{"text":"Went to Skin+Bones originally because their menu had piped chicken liver mousse into a beignet but sad to find out that when we got there, their menu had changed up!  But, what happen afterwards made it all better...The person who was helping us recommended the chefs menu. When we asked what was in it, all he said was \"trust me\". The first item on the chefs menu...BAM the chicken liver mousse served with thinly sliced crispy country bread, I could only describe as f**king amazing!  That night we also ordered the burrata cheese served with a pomegranite walnut pesto (YUM!), juicy meatballs and a cacio e pepe that was pretty good too! To top it off, a perfectly cooked pork steak served on top home made sauerkraut. The bread pudding dessert was OK but I'm not a huge dessert fan anyway.  For drinks I had an old fashion made to perfection (right amount of sweetness to bitters ratio) and the wifey had a moscow mule which she said was amazing.  I would definitely go back especially to try out their brunch, the menu looks awesome!"}
{"text":"The food is just mindblowing here. Seriously, if you're looking to splurge a little on fine dining, look no further. If you're with one or more people: order lots of appetizers, share a main or two, and there's absolutely no way you can't walk out there feeling like you just had a $400 meal.  As somebody on low-medium income, this place absolutely spoils me, and impresses the ladies to no end. The staff are extremely friendly, and as well educated on the food they serve as they are on their wine, cocktails, and beer.  Seriously, this place is a no-brainer. Give it a try for brunch or dinner, and you'll be back for more... their menu is always changing!  And $1 oysters on Sundays. But if you're ONLY there for the oysters deal, tip them well. I've seen large groups of people come in, and get hours of full service for only a $80 bill between say 6 people (so about a $12 tip... if that). For the level & amount of service they provide, just don't be a dick. Thank you."}
{"text":"Came here for my girlfriend's birthday. The whole vibe of the place is really nice but there aren't a ton of tables so you might want to make a reservation online. All the staff were great and attentive and were always happy to explain menu items.  Now, what made this place special is how well they do simple food (I don't mean easy but how much flavor is present with what seems like very few ingredients). My girlfriend had the gnocchi which was SO soft; like a freakin' pillow. I had the steak and ordered a side of crispy potatoes with some kind of aoli and woo-whee, it was amazing! So much flavor for a simple piece of meat. It came with sauteed mushrooms and salsa Verde, which just put everything over the edge... I'm not usually impressed by most steaks I get in a restaurant but my girl was jealous of my dish and I think I'll have the exact same thing when I come back.  The other highlight of the night was the buck a shuck oyster deal. I've never tried oysters in my life but we were feeling like something new and I'll definitely be coming back for them. The oysters were served with a shallot oil and fresh lemon to drizzle over them and they were damn delicious, which was a surprise as I'm a little picky with seafood. Try this place if your looking for a special night out, it won't disappoint and the prices are very reasonable for the quality."}
