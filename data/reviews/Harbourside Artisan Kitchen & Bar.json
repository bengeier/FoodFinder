{"text":"Pleasant decor and nice location with plenty of local parking. The food will appeal to traditionalists who prefer plain food with very little seasoning.  Many of the dishes have seen the fryer. They also feature kitchen-table dishes like pork and beans. My quiche was very soft in the middle, perhaps I would have enjoyed it with more time in the oven and some spices and herbs."}
{"text":"First time to Harbourside. The interior decor is beautiful and comforting. Wife and I had calamari, pork&beans and jambalaya - all were fantastic. They have live music on Fridays and a relaxing seating area in the back. We will happily be going back.  Nice addition to Bronte"}
{"text":"Had heard great things about this little place in Bronte, so I went in sceptical and expecting disappointment. I'm disappointed to say I wasn't. The food is fresh, flavourful and prepared with care. Not Bronte's hippest new establishment but very likely it's best. Recommended."}
{"text":"Our group usually goes to Harbourside on Tuesday evenings. The menu is not huge, but the specials are good and the price is right. Recently had surf and turf with 2 filet medallions and grilled shrimp. One of our gang had panko cheese ravioli with dolce tomato sauce. The steak was good but we all helped him eat the ravioli. Friendly, neighborhood restaurant."}
