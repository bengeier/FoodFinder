{"text":"Very expensive, however this is a delicious sushi restaurant. I like the decor, very classy. I would recommend trying this restaurant out, you've got nothing to lose"}
{"text":"Tucked away on the second floor of an obscure commercial building on Ste Catherine, talking into ZenYa is like walking into another world. You walk into the lobby of the building with skepticism, only to step out onto the second floor into ZenYa which is dim and lit with candles, decorated with bamboo and twine. The restaurant is spacious and the tables are not crowded together at all, which happens to be the case in a lot of restaurants in Montreal. Needless to say, I was impressed.

The service was also very good- Again, something that most places in Montreal lack in.. We were promptly seated without reservations and attended to by our servers who filled and refilled our glasses, took away empty plates, checked in on us without being annoying.

I am not a fish or sushi/sashimi fanatic, so I stayed away from the raw stuff, instead opting for sauteed scallops, cucumbers and zucchini for an entree and the teriyaki atlantic salmon for my main. Both were pretty good, the entree almost outshining the salmon. My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki, which was so good it changed his view on chicken being \"boring\".

For dessert, we had the green tea opera cake which was AMAZING. The green tea made the opera cake lighter (or at least gave it a sense of lightness) which made me feel less guilty about eating it =)

ZenYa is an amazing spot, a hole in the wall, perfect for dates or good Japanese food in the downtown core. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"La bouffe était très bonne mais un peu trop cher... et j'ai attendu 45min pour mon plat!"}
{"text":"Clean and Modern Sushi Joint

Pros:
Good Sushi
Fresh Fish
Variety of special rolls
Nice Decor
Considerate staff (when we ordered too much - we were four guys- the waitress recommend that we hold off before putting our final roll order. She was right)
Some tatami seating available

Cons:
It's on the third floor.

Recommend:
Sea Roll
Green Tea - it's flavored with roasted rice grains"}
{"text":"Les sushis sont très raffinés et l'ambiance tamisée sera à ravir pour un repas en tête à tête. En revanche, l'addition est un peu dure à avaler."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fine, but very hard to locate. It's inside an office building, and the only way we located it was because there was a woman standing outside with a menu who took us to an elevator to the restaurant. One of those places! But my business colleague said it was supposed to be good!

The furniture has definitely seen better days, all tattered and worn. There were just a few people there, on a Monday night. The waiter basically left us alone, which was ok since we had many things to talk about. But it might not be so good if we wanted a speedy meal.

We shared an eggplant appetizer, which was really good. It was basically a skinned Japanese eggplant backed to falling apart, and topped with scallions and seaweed and spices. Never seen anything like it and very good.

I had udon noodle soup, with extra veggies. It was good and satisfied my noodle soup craving.

The place is fine for dinner, but the decor could use some updating."}
{"text":"Too expensive 
That's all i have to say
If you want to waste your money, come here

Some people say the sushis are good, not more that a buffet style sushi.

Think twice before coming here
Service is good but you have to expect it with the pricey meal they have

And it took them over 1 hour to bring 11 sushis"}
{"text":"The sushi was mixed. Tasted and looked fresh, but somewhat mediocre presentation. Spicy and eel sauces were mediocre, but eel was good."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by my hotel.  The ambiance was nice.  I wanted an authentic Japanese place, but all I heard in the back was Chinese.  That said, the food was well done.  Usually you can tell a phony by the sushi rice, and this place didn't over-flavor or over-sweeten the rice, like a lot of Chinese/Korean establishments do.  I think they knew what they were doing when it comes to Japanese food.  the fish in my Chirashi Zushi was very fresh and the portions were generous.  My biggest gripe is the high price tag that didn't really seem justified.  I had to order miso soup separately from my $30 zushi and just those two added up to a final bill of over 40.  Not bad, but not overly impressed either.

There were only a few other patrons in the restaurant, so my wait time was reasonable."}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience- the food was incredible and very fresh- we enjoyed some maki rolls and they were all very tasty. The service however was weak- we found out about the specials after we had almost finished our meal- when we ordered the bottle of wine we were told they were out and asked of we wanted a different one and when we said no they magically found the bottle we were asking for. Overall we found it enjoyable as the food made up for the service. If you like sushi then you will enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Sophisticated yet comfortable atmosphere and great presentation. Finding this place hidden away on a third floor is a real gem."}
{"text":"Just a regular, run of the mill sushi craving crept up on us.  After googling for a new restaurant to try, we fell upon ZenYa.  This interesting, urban oasis is not somewhere you will just happen to stop into, passing by.  It is hidden on the 2nd floor of an office building and if it wasn't for the cute girl, dressed as a geisha waiting to great us outside, we probably would have missed it and not have gotten to experience this delight.

The decor is great, very contemporary and sharp.  We sat at a table near the back and proceed to look over the sushi menu.  Now the regular sushi menu is nothing to write a review on (mind you the fish is incredibly fresh and when it says \"spicy\" it actually has heat to it, unlike every other restaurant!) but their specialty sushis are so delicious and unique.  My Boyfriend and I usually stick solely to the sushi menu when at Japonese restaurants, but we felt compelled to venture onto the regular menu.  Quite the extensive menu!  We tried the salmon tartare:fantastic.  I had the salmon teriyaki and he had the chillian sea bass.  The sea bass was rich and buttery and some of the best fish I've had in a long time.  The teriyaki wasn't overly sweet and the potion size was just right.

My suggestions:  Order at least one thing off the specialty sushi menu!

Bloody ceaser rating: 4.5/5 yummy"}
{"text":"Les sushis sont tout simplement délicieux!!! De plus l'ambiance et le service sont impécables. Je recommenderais cette place à toute mes connaissances"}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome, but since they changed the sushi chef, I would say it's a little disappointing. Flavor, finess and quality has been traded for quantity, average quality and tasteless ordinary sushis. We used to order the special chef combination and always get out very satisfied, but last time, for 200$ for two we found the usual quality of home delivered sushi available at the corner of street. Very sad, we just want to old chef back!!!"}
{"text":"The service is numbingly slow. Over 20 minutes for a salad! The prices are quite high. The quality is nice and the food was interesting, but you lose your interest in tasting food when you start contemplating eating the paper over your chopsticks from lack of nourishment! Atmosphere is very dark."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last week and, simply from the ambiance, expected to be blown away.

A quick look at the menu revealed high prices but I assumed that it would be well worth it. After ordering 5 items to share with a friend, we waited.. And waited.....and waited for what seemed like forever.

The service was extremely and over the top slow at around 7:30pm on a Wednesday. I think it was close to 8:15 by the time we got our appetizers. The black cod was just okay - lacking a bit of flavor but the salmon roll we ordered (can't remember the name.. Part of appetizer menu) was practically out of this world. For our shared sushi plate, we ended up ordering three varieties which were all good (but not excellent).

This cost us around $75 including tip so I'd say that for the price here, it's definitely not worth it when it takes over two hours to get out and when the food is just ok. I'd come back for that initial salmon appetizer roll but that's about it.."}
{"text":"We came on a quiet Sunday night. First impression: beautiful decor and atmosphere.

However, the service was very slow. The waitress rarely came to our table unless we called her. When we were ordering or asking something, she would rush without taking the time to listen to us. After my boyfriend ordered, she was about to leave without asking for my order (he also got the wrong order). There was only 3 other clients in the restaurant at that time. 

Despite the slow service, we still had hope and were expecting for high quality food. The sushis were good. My boyfriend had filet mignon. The meat was great. It came with rice, noodles and little bit of veggies, which however all tasted very bland. The dessert was great.

We finished our food and waited for over half an hour. Still no service. We called the waitress for the bill, ordered dessert, and quickly left.

Overall, 2/5 service and 3/5 food (overpriced). I wouldn't come back, but the experience was not that bad."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place while walking on St. Catherine's street where there was a girl in a kimono standing on the street. We decided to give it a try since we had a craving for sushi. She ushered us into the elevator and brought us to the third floor. We wouldn't have found this place if it wasn't for the girl out front on the street.

The host seated us, and the bus boy poured us water and gave us our menus, oh and even lit our tea light candle!  Our waitress took forever to greet us, and when she came by, we were ready to order. We ordered the vegetable and shrimp tempura, and a cold sake to start (another waitress saw us waiting there with our menus and asked if we've been helped after we had ordered). Again, it took about 30-45 minutes for the tempura to come out, and when it did, she brought us just a vegetable tempura which consisted of two tiny mushrooms, one small broccoli, one slice of eggplant and bell pepper. We told the waitress that she had brought us the wrong order, she took it back, and about 10 minutes later, the correct tempura came back with four shrimp tempura, a slice of eggplant, a small broccoli and a slice of bell pepper, they took the mushrooms out. I thought that the tempura was decent, it wasn't very hot though, everything was cold. 

At this point, we still had not received our sake, so I asked the waitress for our sake.  It seemed as though she had forgotten, so she ran back and about 10 minutes later, she brought over hot sake. We had to flag her down again and remind her that we had ordered a cold sake. She apologized again, and came back about 5 minutes later with a warm bottle of sake in a small bucket of ice water and told us to give it a few minutes to get cold...

An hour after we had placed the order, ate our tempura and drank our sake, the sushi we ordered came out. At least she couldn't screw this order up since we checked it off on a piece of paper. We ordered four rolls: the dynamite roll, spicy salmon, spicy tuna and california. The sushi selection was not great and very limited. We thought the sushi was pretty good, but the service was appauling, although I asked another waitress for tea, she was very pleasant and served us tea because our waitress never bothered to ask.

When our waitress, Annie came to clear our plates, she asked how things were, so I said \"they were ok\", she didn't even bother to ask why because she could care less. The only reason I knew her name was from the bill.

I do not recommend this place to anyone, everything is OVER PRICED and SERVICE IS NON-EXISTENT. We were there for 2 hours! Our waitress was an air head and could not get one single thing correct, they do have decent sushi, but it's definetly NOT WORTH IT, STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Great food. Sushi was fresh and delicious. A bit pricey, but worth it if you like high quality food."}
{"text":"Un bijoux caché. 
Oui, le service est long (mais courtois) mais ça vaut tellement la peine. Le poisson est frais, les sauces sont délicieuses, la présentation est magnifique, le décor est superbe. 
Oui c'est un peu cher mais ça équivaut la qualité des produits. 
Même les desserts sont incroyables! 
J'y emmene ma mère quand je veut la gâter et ça fait amplement le travail."}
{"text":"service is too slow. And the restrount is overpriced. The most ridiculous thing is when I give 10% tip, the japaness waitress give the money back to me and ask for at least 15% tip. This is the first time I was asked for more tip. Especially for the sooooo slow service, how can she ask for more tip? Oh maybe she know this is the last time we came to this bad restaurant, so she doesn't care."}
{"text":"Food 2.5/5 
Atmosphere and service: 5/5

The food was alright, but my review of course is very subjective to my own standards, and when it comes to Japanese Cuisine I have extremely high standards. It was meh ... for the price, the tempura I had wasn't overwhelmingly OMG and my friend ordered the Beef Teriyaki and that wasn't overwhelmingly OMG too, not even savory on the first bite! Don't even get me started on the desert....it wasn't ...fresh! Overall the food was below my expectation. I didn't try the sashimi or sushi, but from the overall surroundings, I believe the restaurants caters better to that type of food. What I do have to give them is the creativity in their dishes, they did have a variety of options that intrigued me.

Atmosphere and service though, was amazing! I love the vibes that was going around the restaurant and it was just perfect for intimate conversation. Definitely the biggest attraction to the restaurant. 

If the restaurant improves its food to be a 5/5, this place will definitely will be a reoccurring place to visit."}
{"text":"Very interesting options. Very creative chefs and perfect place for sashimi lovers!! You will get long and big pieces :)"}
{"text":"Very nice sushi place right in the heart of Rue St. Catherine.  It looks like a non-descript building but once you make it to the 3rd floor, the inside of the restaurant is well decorated and comfortable.

We did a sushi Omakase for 4 people (no hot dishes), and they just gave us two huge platters of Nigiri, Sashimi, and various rolls.  Even with all the beer, sake, etc. it ended up being about $65 per person, quite reasonable given the quality of the fish and the sheer amount of food.  I would definitely come back to Zen-Ya for sushi again."}
{"text":"Solid sushi choice for Sunday night downtown. We came here for a family meal and all was good. Nothing too crazy creative but everything delivered on expectations, which is pretty important for sushi. I was happy with the wine list, I just became obsessed with Bourgogne Aligote and they had one on the list. The location is a bit odd, you head up two floors to find the restaurant. Decor is modern and hip."}
{"text":"Will not come back here again. We were out for a bachelor party on our last night and wanted to treat the bachelor to a good meal and sushi. We had a party of 9 and it was a walk-in. We sat in the private room and the host said they were short staffed. The saki and cocktails were good and the sushi was fresh and flavorful except the bland tuna one our friends got.  Our server was slow and rarely checked in on us and to make it worse we waited a good 45 minutes for our entrees. I had to speak to the host/managers on 2 separate occasions. It wasn't until the 3rd timer our server finally came by to apologize and offer us a round of drinks. It was a nice gesture but should have been done 30 minutes earlier. The entire meal took about 2.5 hours and we walked out of that place more sober before we came. Great food, good decorum, horrible service and lack of timeliness."}
{"text":"Zen-Ya is on the floor above a nightclub, on Rue Saint Catherine. They're mysteriously hidden, up until when you get to their attractive entrance, where you'll undoubtedly run into parties waiting to be seated. (Unsure how my friends found out about this place, but we found ourselves there for dinner one evening.)

Amid Zen-Ya's hip, lounge-like environs - and sushi bar - were servers bustling about and fellow diners sampling fresh sushi. Unfortunately, someone thought it would be a good idea to leave the lights low, and was way too dark (think: coffin) at our table. We requested the lights be turned up, which helped immensely: seeing our food increased the enjoyment factor, and bento boxes are not exempt.

Their menu is chock full of Japanese selections; prices are reasonable. I don't think I ordered the \"right\" items - I had some tough squid in my bento box - and the rolls I tried weren't that memorable. With Sho-dan in the city, I wouldn't return to Zen-Ya unless I lived in town, and then probably only for drinks. Still, they had their moments, and I suggest trying them for yourself."}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing . We thought it would really be a gem since it is hard to find and really hidden away. We were wrong. It was overpriced and underwhelming.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice, but the food is nothing special and rather expensive in relation to quality. The wine list and drink selection is minimal. What was most stunning was how there were only about 4 other tables in the restaurant, at least 5 waitresses working and we rarely ever saw our waitress. It was too bad because our group was willing to spend double what we did on food and drink, but didn't because the service was so \"laissez-faire\".
Went with a group of 8 and everyone found the portions small  and the food very bland. We had to wait nearly an hour to get our bills even though we asked three times. 

If you're in this area of town and want to do sushi for a group. I recommend going to Kanda instead. If you want a romantic spot for sushi, try Sho-Dan up on Metcalfe."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and an elegant atmosphere. Highly recommended if you're looking for higher quality sushi in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Just to give you a summary of today lunch.   We got the Atami room

Group of 8 people. We arrived early 11:50am, all were sitting and ready to order by 12:00.
Waitress shows ups (after we asked a couple of times) at 12:25pm. Takes our order.

Soup arrives with Salad at 12:45. (After we asked again)

Lunch arrives at 1:15pm. We had to rush to eat it  to get back to the office........

Can we say SLOWWWWW Service.....they need to hire more staff....

It's a pity, because the food is good and the ambiance is nice.....but seriously slow."}
{"text":"I have never waited 2 hours for a simple sushi dinner. I came for a bachelorette party - we got there at 9pm. We didn't appetizers or even extra chopsticks (or plates) until 10p. By the way the restaurant wasn't even that crowded. I think they were understaffed. 

We got our food at 11p. Mind you we only got 80 percent of the rolls. We had to wait an extra 45 minutes for the rest of the food. By that time I was so hungry and upset I couldn't eat the sushi I could've easily made at home. Never come here."}
{"text":"I would not recommend to come here... Interior design is nice but the orders are really slow... We waited for 30 minutes and they didn't have 5 types of sashimi and baked food we wanna order.. Ramen is too soft that it's like overcooked."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Dark brown wood flooring, black wood furniture. At this point, 29 March 2013, you need to take the elevator to the second floor to get there. On a Good Friday night, the restaurant wasn't too busy (though there were plenty of filled tables; it is a big place), and the service was excellent - friendly, and always there when needed. 

We had simple late dinner (the waitress let us know it would not be enough if we were hungry) of a California Roll, one order of hamachi sushi, and one of the specials, Mike's Roll. 

The  California roll was much better and bigger than similarly named creations elsewhere, the hamachi was clearly fresh, and Mike's Roll, lightly deep fried, was interesting and tasty. 

Including tax and tip, $40. One another night, with wine and hungrier, it could be twice that much. All in all, when we return to Montreal, we will be back. Perhaps the owners have read previous reviews and fixed the service."}
{"text":"I was expecting a bit more from this place, especially at this price. The sushi was a bit bland and the karaage and gyoza were very run of the mill. Nice atmosphere however and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"The sashimi were very fresh. I recommend salmon tartare, it was best salmon tartare i had. The price was worth it. Personally, I didn't like deep fried sushi maki, but my bf enjoyed it.

Maki were okay..but wasn't crazy good. But the appetizer was amazing. If you go this restaurant, don't forget to order appetizer!"}
{"text":"We came here per our hotel's concierge's suggestion. It was a bit of a walk from the hotel, but worth it.

It's on the 3rd floor in the downtown area. The ambiance was very hip/dark/asian . The sushi was fresh and tasty. The spicy tuna was good, altho only 2 pieces were served vs. the usual 6. Negi Hamachi was good too."}
{"text":"amazing hidden unknown place....loved it! we took the chef selection for 65$ each person and it was amazing!  the chef is actually Japanese born and raised and it shows 

A place for sure that we will go back for couple or a group of friends"}
{"text":"Yes, this place is hard to find (I had to go to the second floor, come back  down the stairs and out, then went up to the fourth floor then took the elevator to the second floor again.  It really shouldn't have been that hard. They definitely need a sign at the door but hey it was part of the \"hunt\" for good sushi).  Yes it is a bit dark (it's called ambience) 

BUT!!!!! the fish was fresh,delicious and excellent!

I was in town for business and was stayingat the hotel around the corner and asked my concierge about a good place for sushi.  Mind you, I am from California and have a pretty good palate when it comes to telling good sushi from mediocre sushi and this was very good.

It was a slow night and sat at the sushi bar (the usual) and asked the chefs Mark (rolls) and Take (sashimi) to surprise me.  And that they did.

It's definitely a fusion place to a certain extent.  

They started me off with a portabella mushroom stuffed with scallops and a cream sauce (not too much) which was exquisite.  

While I was eating the portabella, the chefs asked me what I liked and I explained pretty much everything except Uni (sea urchin).  What came next was sheer pleasure.

The roll made a roll consisting of unagi and some other fish (sorry it was just good and didn't catch the name of it) next came a parade of various fresh sashimi (the \"catch of the day\"-scallops, real crab meat (OMFG!!), salmon, hamachi, albacore, etc).  The freshness and taste of everything pleasantly surprised me.

I had a huge smile on my face!!! During this parade of fishes I was speaking with the sashimi chef and he had convinced me to try the Uni.  I guess he had realized that I was not going to have room for dessert so he made Uni and of course more unagi (which had advocado between the rice and eel) nigiri  look like a dessert.  They looked so delicious and tasted just as they looked.

These gentlemen are honestly artists in their profession.  Kudos to them and the restaurant Zen Ya!!"}
{"text":"We just went for a birthday dinner with a friend of mine and it was like pulling teeth to order and receive any food and drink.  Our glasses were perpetually empty.  We ordered dishes that never arrived.  For the price and location, not to mention other reviews on yelp - I thought this place would be a hidden gem, I was truly disappointed.  

I did step away towards the end to mention that we had been unable to order additional drinks and food, and sort of complained that we were very disappointed - no apology or anything."}
{"text":"I'm in Montreal for a work function.

Our team went to supper there last night.  There were 15 in our party.

We were seated in the front at two big low tables.  It looks like you'll have to sit on the floor yoga-style but there's actually a big pit in the floor so your legs are dangling.  And you have to take your shoes off.

I'm not a fan of sushi, etc. so was happy to see that there was chicken teriyaki on the menu.  Most of my colleagues ordered mixed sushi.  It looked fun and colourful and they enjoyed it.

I found the service was slow and when my meal did come, it was warm, not hot."}
{"text":"Slowest restaurant ever --- legit 1 hr 45 min for sushi and the sushi was just okay. Don't waste your time."}

{"text":"Received an email from the owner of the restaurant,  who states they are still open and it was a competitor across the street that closed. I don't live in Montreal so I can't confirm,  but my apologies to the proprietor. I wish I had found your restaurant as I was very much in the mood for sushi that night. Perhaps some better signage might be in order?"}

{"text":"Restaurant très classe et vraiment joli. C'est agréable il n'y a pas trop de bruits surtout pour un vendredi soir. De plus, les serveurs sont sympathiques. Le poisson était super bon et frais, la présentation est véritablement magnifique. J'ai choisi un cocktail avec alcool au Litchi, un délice. Petit coup de cur pour le homard et le poulet fris. Les sushis étaient bons mais pas exceptionnels pour ma part. Les crevettes tempura dont je suis une grande consommatrice étaient bonnes mais un peu trop huileuse. Et les bananes tempura un peu fade. Nous étions un groupe de 6, nous avons donc commandé tout plein de choses, j'ai gouté à pleins de mets différents. Il y a des mets fabuleux, d'autres un peu moins. Mais je pense que tu peux y trouver ton compte sans problème. Très bonne soirée dans l'ensemble"}
{"text":"Where can I start, the sushi is very good. ive been there twice and the 1st time I was there I got big pieces of sashimi and the last time I was there I got \"average\" cuts. 


The soups here are to die for and the house salads were amazing. Def worth going to eat there if you're stuck on St Catherines.."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service.  Waited over an hour before any food arrived on the table.  Anything that was supposed to be warm wasn't.  It's a shame because the sushi was actually decent."}
