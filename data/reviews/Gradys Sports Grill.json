{"text":"Cold beer and that's about it for the positive. If it doesn't come out of a can not sure if the cook could make it, we started out with the nacho's and they were very disappointing all canned items. the fish was decent. At one point the cook called the waitress's bitch's and we weren't even 5ft from the kitchen."}
{"text":"It was actually pretty funny...  They remodeled the place - added a bunch of wood paneling on the walls, reupholstered benched and added a nice table and nice bar chairs.  They were playing lounge music that matched the benches I suppose, but had salt and pepper shakers that were more reminiscent of IHOP.  There was sports on the televisions, but obviously the sound wasn't on and the the one guy that came in to watch the Brewers game was disappointed because although they had gotten the MLB package, they were unable to pull up the Brewers game.  They also didn't have the Blackhawks vs Coyotes game on (they actually did for a while and then they changed it).  Sports bar..?  Midwestern sports bar...??  The only thing I have good to say about the food was that I liked the thickness of the chicken fried steak.  So let's start on the salad - chopped baggy lettuce with watery \"dressing\".  We also had blue cheese and ranch dressing with the wings - both were watery, so much so that you couldn't really taste which was which.  The mashed potatoes were comically pasty.  I couldn't eat it after a few bites.  The wings had a weird batter on it that made it feel gritty.  They were almost overcooked so some pieces were a bit chewy.  The quality/size of the wings weren't fitting of a $8 price tag.  And who serves wings without celery and/or carrot?!  The pricing!  We were there on a week night around 6pm and their \"drink special\" was 3.50 for coors light and miller lite bottles.  Their special dinner was $9 and their wings were $8.  All in all, I will probably not be going back.  They need to pick one direction with the bar and hold true to it (the pool hall like table and stool section vs the lounge booths vs the swanky bar stool decor says it all).  The food was pretty bad..  it seems they went cheap on a lot of things thinking people wouldn't notice (ie dressing, mashed potatos) yet put a price tag on it befitting of a nice restaurant that has it all down.  The confusing atmosphere did not help at all - at one point they played hispanic club music.  Next!"}

{"text":"Like a small visit home-Wisconsin.  Went in for lunch, had a walleye sandwich.  It was very good.  The service was great.  It's a Packer bar, so I will have to visit during a game."}
