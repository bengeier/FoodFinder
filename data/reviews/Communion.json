{"text":"Ordered crab cakes eggs Benedict amazing. Had a bite of salmon eggs Benedict also amazing. Great food all around."}
{"text":"Great beer, chic decor, yucky cabbage dish which was over priced. Avoid that dish at all cost!"}
{"text":"We were staying in old Montreal and went looking for a good Bloody Cesar for breakfast.   We ended up at Communion as our first two choices were full up.  We had eggs benedict and Bloody Cesars for what turned out to be brunch.  Both were mediocre at best. There was nothing bad about the two items, they were just dull, bland, uninteresting.  Mediocre.  We won't bother going back to Communion next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Been here about a dozen times. I've never waited for a table and reservations are easy. The decor, location and setting are upscale but relaxed, typical old port venue. Food is generally very good, quality of ingredients is excellent but execution can vary a lot. As your group has to share an order, they're sometimes off with the quantities and you can end up with less or more food than you'd need. They're always willing to brig extra though. Service is always super friendly, but never efficient. This is the perfect place for a lazy, boozy brunch in a relaxed atmosphere. Not so much for a quick and cheap brunch. Prices are inline with what you can expect for this quality of food/location."}
{"text":"What an awful experience. We have been in line for 30 minutes.  While waiting we saw the host taking forever to seat people (we counted at least 5 empty tables outside only) and the slowest servers in history (2 guys to clean up 1 table with 1 tray, picking up a glass at a time while talking and laughing with each other).  It was finally our turn and, I guess a manager, shows up to tell us that it's 2.30pm and that they don't serve food anymore. How about the courtesy to warn all of the people that were in line for 30 minutes?!??! Seriously, the technique of having people waiting outside forever to create the \"buzz\" or the \"cool place vibe\" is old and in disuse Communion!! Successful places around the world focus on great food and great service nowadays...that's what make them \"cool\". There are a bunch of other places in the city of Montreal...do yourself a favor and explore one in which they treat you with RESPECT!"}
{"text":"Although the atmosphere and image is nice, the service, food, and staff are lacklustre.   When asking questions about their menu, the waitress seemed annoyed to answer. It took over an hour to get our appetizers, and even longer for the main course. For a restaurant that tries to be classy and refined, their service has a long way to go. Skip this one."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if possible! This place has the worst customer service in all of Montreal. No one was at the front to greet people as they came in. They had a line out the door and would continue to run around erratically.  Poorly ran...was definitely the worst experience we had while visiting and would not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Good brunch, but the service was slooow. We ordered drinks and food on the patio, which was nice, but it took a half hour to even get our drinks.  I'd give it another shot based on the patio."}
{"text":"Spring has finally sprung and with that comes a new gastronomic addition in town: the new Sugaring Off brunch and dinner menu signed by Chef/Jedi JC Morency and his team for one of the loveliest restaurant and bar in Montreal, Communion. Because we have already tried Communion's brunch and loved it so much, we were curious to try out their dinner menu as part of the festival. And wow! It was definitely a  revisited modern version of a complete sugar shack meal! Read more on http://theforbiddenmeal.com/2015/03/22/communion-new-sugaring-off-dinner-menu-signed-by-chef-jc-morency/"}
{"text":"Brunch zéro défaut ! Service agréable et excellent rapport qualité-prix. Magnifique terrasse avec localisation idéale !"}
{"text":"Went for brunch, I had the Santé and my boyfriend got the BLT. We sat on the patio. The service was friendly and quick to seat us. I thought my plate was delicious and the portions were generous. The Santé consisted of 2 poached eggs, 3 mini blueberry pancakes with some maple syrup, a green salad with sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese, and an adorable mason jar of homemade granola and yogurt. My boyfriend's dish however wasnt as appreciated. His BLT was a slice of toast with jarlesboug cheese, bacon, tomatoes and an egg on top as well as a green salad and roasted potatoes. They must have used a pan to toast the bread and melt the cheese on top because the bottom of his toast was completely burnt. Both dishes were served with some freshly squeezed orange juice and a coffee and came with a tin can of fresh baguette, bagel, and homemade blueberry and Raspberry jam. Despite the burnt BLT, I thoroughly enjoyed the food and experience at communion."}
{"text":"After waiting 30 minutes for a glass of water, we had to find another place to eat. The waitress and hostess were rude and unapologetic for their lack of attention. The food looked great but the service is extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been in this place often for their happy hours, but never for their Brunch. Yesterday I tried their brunch with low expectation reading the reviews, but I found it quit acceptable! Yes  there is nothing exceptional but my egg Benedict was well prepared and loved the spinach and salmon coming with it. They also serve very good coffee! And most importantly they have a great wine list you can have with you brunch ... why not .. :)"}
{"text":"We hurried into Communion on a Saturday afternoon when it started to rain and were delighted to find ourselves in a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Bar tenders were very nice and it was perfect spot to post up for an afternoon glass if wine."}
{"text":"Restaurant week was a fail.  Waitress forgot my chowder order, water had a hair in it, and drinks were forgotten.   Fish cakes were overly salty and full of filler."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We waited half an hour to get a menu, waited an hour for our food. We didnt ever get water refills, no napkins (we used our own napkins), no waiter ever came to serve us, we didnt even get ketchup for our fries. It wasnt even busy hour most of the restaurant was empty. First time I ever went to a restaurant and gave ZERO tips. They have a good location which is why they get their customers. I would never come here again."}
{"text":"Had the best service ever. Good food, good wine. Great location, right in the heart of the Montreal Old Port. Cool ambiance, very hearty. The staff was very nice with us. Perfect dinner. Amazing place."}
{"text":"A church-themed restaurant with benches instead of chairs, lots of dark wood and a dark, rustic feel? That's not at all what this restaurant is about, but hey, could be a hot idea.  The restaurant's name, Communion, actually refers to the idea of sharing. We were seated in the small side room with grey stone walls, which provided a perfect setting and atmosphere to support the act. Oh, and the food is not all you'll be sharing - the restaurant has a unisex bathroom. I can already imagine awesome \"how we met\" stories coming out of this.  Communion's food is broad in range and would best be described as \"contemporary European\" market cuisine. The menu consists of tapas-sized dishes and larger plates to share. My friend and I decided to start with some oysters, the salmon tartare bouchée with a basil emulsion and cucumber brunoise, and rollmops (pickled herring wrapped around slices of onion and pickled gherkin) with chive purée and sour cream. Tartare is an easy miss, but both of these amuse-bouches were completely flavourful and delicious.  Next, we tried this whole \"sharing thing\" by ordering the \"Stuffed Savoie cabbage\" - a half cabbage shell filled with layers of olive tapenade, mashed butternut squash, feta cheese, and quinoa salad with pistachios and garlic flowers.  Sounds weird? It was... But in an unexpected \"i-ve'never-tasted-this-before-but-I-really-DO-like-it!\" sort of way. Tasty (and health conscious!) comfort-style food.  We finished the entire  1/2 cabbage which, unfortunately, deterred us from ordering dessert. Apparently it's made by a Parisian chef... Certainly a reason for another visit.  Communion's concept is cute, but possibly only if a pairs agrees on a dish.  Would adding some single dishes dilute the restaurant's concept? Maybe. In any case, I'll end with this: Communion is perfect for a chill and comfortable dinner with friends or for a romantic date. It's cozy, and sometimes, party girls need a night that's good for the soul.   Food 8.5/10, Atmosphere (ifyouwantachillsetting)9/10, Pretty people 8/10, Music (whenyoucanhearit) 8/10, Service 9.5/10.   Pictures: http://belledenuitmontreal.com/posts/communion/"}
{"text":"This place was a nice area and right next to the river, the scenery was excellent. We just went on Mayday and all I can say is SLOW. We sat down and it took over 30 mins to even get the drinks we ordered. The waitstaff was understaffed and serving to many tables then what they could handle. My friends ordered the hamburger and I got the lobster roll. It took 45 min to get our food which was ordered once we got our drinks. So by the time the food came out we had already been sitting for an hour and a half.   The lobster roll was okay but not great for the price and my friends ordered the burger which wasn't even a burger, more like a slider, which was $17. It could've been counted as an appetizer!   Lastly getting our check took an additional 30 min, when we finally decided to walk into the bar to get our bills. The waiter apologized and said he was sorry that he was overwhelmed and had to many tables.   I will not be going back here again. It's overpriced and the menu is basic."}
{"text":"Had brunch at this lovely place a while back and while the place is very well located with a nice interior and friendly staff, the food is just OK. The eggs Benedict are good but nothing special, and definitely very over priced. The side serving of fruits and potatoes was disappointing, with maybe 8 little pieces of ordinary breakfast potatos. The plates come with a glass of orange juice and bottomless filter coffee, which was nice although the coffee was cold and we asked for refills often to keep it lukewarm.  Staff was thankfully very friendly, but wouldn't really recommend it as there are many better options in the area."}
{"text":"Ain't the cheapest spot. Food is above average. Wins for aesthetic."}
{"text":"Au menu, on commence par l'ardoise pour deux, incluant un tartare, des ailes de cailles sur une purée de betteraves et un foccacia maison avec un coulis de poivrons.  En plat principal, on se laisse tenter par la bavette de boeuf, juteuse et bien salée. Elle est servie avec de délicieux légumes racines et une purée parfaitement lisse de céleri-rave. J'ai aussi pu goûter à la petite citrouille farcie de risotto aux pistaches et champignons sauvages, un amalgame de saveurs incroyable.  La soirée se conclue sur un gâteau au fromage avec sorbet à la fraise, et du nougat glacé avec dés de brownies."}
{"text":"We ate here twice. The beer selection, wines and small plates are great. My favorite item was the Rice Bowl with Fish. It was excellent. The ambiance and service were cool. Not sure why it's not higher rated by others. We ate at a fair range of small cafes, highly regarded nice restaurants and bars and Communion was super excellent. In a potentially tourist-trappy area but surprisingly low-keyed and lovely. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Thanks for advertising brunch until 2:30 and closing 1:30 - really made for a great morning of running round a snowy, sludgy city trying to make alternate brunch plans. Never again."}
{"text":"Went here for MTL à Table.  Usually during this week event restaurants try and showcase their best food and try to build more buzz around their establishment. They FAILED.  Food tried to be \"gourmet\" but fell short.   Service was HORRIBLE. Reservation for 8. Showed up at 730pm to have a couple pints and enjoy their 1$ oyster's on Thursday nights. This was the only good part of the experience. The oysters were good. Oyster sides and sauces were MEH.  Waited till 830 to be seated at our table. Waited another 20 minutes to get our first drink. Waiting another 15 to order. And this theme continued all night. It wasn't even that busy. Ended up having to stand up and walk to the front to pay for our bill at 1130pm.  Food was crap.  Started with the Clam chowder, Sweet and just not good. Then had Braised beef macreuse, gratin dauphinois, red wine sauce. Not great. Didn't even get to eat the desert because it took too long.  Cool location near the water in the Old port.  I would steer clear of this restaurant and save your money for REAL gourmet spots that you will leave happy with..  Would only go back to have some 1$ oysters and maybe a couple beers, that's about it. would definitely NOT order any meals or appetizers."}
{"text":"Outstanding brunch. Their eggs Benedict served over crab cakes was absolutely marvellous, and their house made jam and breads were awesome. My wife had the smoked salmon Benedict and loved it; although the smoked salmon was pretty average, the perfectly poached eggs and hollandaise sauce really made breakfast special.   The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. It's expensive, but the food is amazing. If you're staying in old Montreal, grab a bite here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Essayer une première fois pour le club des oenophiles, j'ai beaucoup aimer mon expérience. La formule toute simple à 40$ nous permet de goûter une dizaine de vins présentés par le sommelier ainsi qu'un importateur invité. De plus, on nous sers un amuse bouche et nous pouvons aussi commander pour compléter. J'ai pu goûter l'assiette de charcuterie, la soupe à l'oignon avec grilled cheese à l'epoisse ainsi que les os à la moelle, vraiment délicieux. La formule qui semble populaire se répète avec des vins différents aux 2 semaines et peut être même plus souvent dans un avenir rapproché, vue la grande popularité. J'y retournerais définitivement"}
{"text":"A fantastic French bistro in the heart of the Old Port, Communion is bright, classy and intimate, perfect for a group of friends or loved ones. The name, which makes you think of a dark, gloomy church, is nothing like the actual decor. It's a modern take on the classic French bistro.  The idea behind Communion is centered around sharing. You share your meal, your table, even the bathroom. It was a surprise to us, but we loved the unique spin on restaurant dining.  We went for Sunday brunch and it was fabulous. We shared the Eggs Benedict (which they call Almost Benedict), which was two poached eggs per person, plus a platter of smoked salmon, duck confit, goat cheese, grilled tomato and sauteed spinach.   To start the meal, we were served a large basket of homemade bagels and French baguette, topped with fresh, housemade jam. Fresh squeeze orange juice and Japanese green tea were the perfect accompaniments to our delicious meal.   To top the whole experience off, I am gluten-free and dairy-free and they were incredibly accommodating. Of course, I didn't eat the bread, but instead of the bread that they served with our eggs, they made me a gluten-free buckwheat crepe and held the milk to make it dairy-free as well.   It was totally perfect and I will definitely go back (this time for dinner) next time I'm in Montreal.  http://queenofquinoa.blogspot.com @alyssarimmer"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a snack and a drink. Got fries with mayo and olives.  Pretty decent fare.  Decent craft beer selection.  Had like 5 beers on tap and more in bottles.  Lots of locals in bottles. Lots of people floating in.  Asked for the check and it took another 15 minutes and asking a second waiter to get it.  Not sure what that was about, but I'm not hacking on them for that. I can only give it 3 stars because I just had a simple snack, and not a full meal, but the portions looked huge to me."}
{"text":"I want to preface my review by saying that I was on the fence about this place, and thus, didn't have high expectations to begin with.  Location: In the heart of the old port on de la Commune. I can see this being a nice place for drinks in the summer. The closest subway stop is Place d'Armes and street parking is available but good luck with that. If you can walk down or use the subway, this is a better option (lots are VERY expensive in this area and there's always a risk of damages to your car).  The place: The space is warm and inviting, with windows facing out onto de la Commune. It's split out into two rooms, the bigger of which is facing the port. The only thing that I found strange is that when you walk in, you're immediately facing what seems to be a hallway that may or may not lead to the kitchen (or toilets - I don't really know). It's just... there.  The food: The reason I agreed to come here is because it was my friend's choice for MTL à Table (I'd already picked the other two places I was going to). As such, I expected an experience that was on par with what I experienced at Pastaga last week, and Barbounya, last year. So did not happen. To begin, I ordered the clam chowder with bacon and potato. Not my usual style of appy but I wanted to try something new and the guy next to me had ordered it, and I could smell it from where I sat. So yes, it smelled amazing but sadly did not deliver on taste. I found the chowder to be very bland and the clams were chewy as hell. I tried to eat one but found myself in a perpetual state of chewing, got fed up, and extracted said clam from my mouth. My date had the Zucchini carbonara, which she seemed to enjoy (though the dish looked a little limp to me).   For the main, I went with the seared scallops and vegetables. Overall, the dish was barely lukewarm. The scallops tasted great, but the vegetables were a mish mash of Romanesco and other assorted veggies that looked like they were just sort of dropped on the plate. Also, who cooks radishes (disclaimer: it looked like radish and had the radish tail, as I call it).  My date had the meat dish and said it was decent but not hot enough.  For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse and my date had the apple crumble. The mousse was OK but nothing to write home about. My data wasn't impressed with the apply thing.   Service: Frankly, the staff was a little disinterested and chilly. I would think that when a restaurant chooses to participate in MTL à Table, it's because they want to show the world how awesome they are, and therefore, staff should be on their toes, right? Don't get me wrong - the service wasn't terrible, but our waitress wasn't exactly warm and fuzzy, and we waited almost 45 minutes to get our mains - and I think we only got them because my friend got fed up and asked the waitress if we were going to be fed soon. Our water was never refilled and when we paid the bill, chick stood right over us, presumably to see if we would tip. I mean, really? Not cool, sister.   Overall: My friend rates this a 7/10. I'm going with a 6/10 and I probably won't return. But, I do wish these guys the best of luck."}
{"text":"Where there for a glass of wine around 10 pm. We ordered oysters. We saw the food that was served at the other tables; smelled good, looked good just like you would expect it to be when going through the menu. The place is nice too. Nice location  Everything was pushing us to reserve for this place for our next date night. But... service sucked. Too bad. I'll try it again as I always give a second chance"}
{"text":"Came here for some drinks and a bite to eat. Sat on the patio, the server came and took our drink order. It took a while to get our drinks and then when we finally got them we never saw the waiter again. My husband had to go into the restaurant to order another beer from the bartender. Still the server never came to check on us. Never asked us if we wanted food. Nothing. This may be a record for the worst service ever. Which seems silly considering there are dozens of other restaurants and patios in Old Montreal to choose from. Do yourself a favour and skip this spot."}
{"text":"I would honestly say 2.5 because the service was good it was really just the food that was mediocre. The idea of this place is really unique but ridiculously overpriced. They serve meals in a family style way but at $18-$22 per person per menu item you must be kidding. I had the monte Cristo sandwich and sadly it was extremely underwhelming. The bread was weirdly sweet, I'm not sure why. If you've read any of my reviews you'll know I do like sweet and savory brunch but this wasn't a good sweet and savory. The ham to cheese ratio was totally off, the bread looked well cooked but had literally no crunch at all, the cheese wasn't melted and the ham was cold in the middle.. Not cool. I'd definitely keep an eye out for somewhere better."}
{"text":"Perfect brunch spot in old port Montreal. Great place to stop and eat for a day of walking around. Endless mimosas till 3pm isn't bad either!"}
{"text":"loved it.  fit for foodies! didn't strike me as country french.  It's more refined.  We had octopus brochette, a meat tartare and a salmon tartare, veal brochette and magret of goose (and a leg) for two that was beautifully presented and perfectly executed.  There was a good selection of nightly specials.  Perfect service.  Right on the Old Montreal waterfront and steps away from vibrant St Paul street. Modern decor, whimsical soft lighting over the bar, romantic."}
{"text":"Is this place open?   Arrived at noon. The sign on the door said the hours begin at 11:30. But the door was locked and there was no sign of life inside."}
{"text":"Had brunch there... When we came the terrace was half full. We ordered right the way  And waited 45min for the food arrived. The same with cocktails.  When the food finally came it was cold... Saw my waitress only twice. On busy Saturday they should have more stuff working,  otherwise all the great job kitchen done is gone."}
{"text":"Loved our breakfast. Had the sante and enjoyed every last bite. The ambiance is also lovely seeing as it's not on the main drag of old Montreal. We were outside but I also loved the interior bar. My only qualm were the pan handlers that came right up to us while we were waiting for our meal. We had a street side seat, but still surprising."}
{"text":"I give it four stars because the potatoes werent crispy. I ordered the blt, which was open faced, a fried egg, smoked bacon, cheese, arugala and tomatoe. I got freshly squeezed orange juice small, but small was like a tall shot glass. A little smaller then I expected. Very tastey. My date got the english breakfast and loved the sausage and blood pudding. He gives it 5 stars hands down, but its my review and I stick to my guns! :-P"}
{"text":"Place vraiment trop touristique, c'est bon, mais c'est pas l'extase... Brunch très simple ! Il manque comme un petit quelque chose. Je pense qu'il y a bien d'autres places sûrement plus sympa et meilleures... Le jus d'orange pressé est très bon mais il y a comme un goût de pas assez... Bref, je ne le recommande pas vraiment..."}
{"text":"One of the best meals we've had this year, and we're from Philadelphia. Excellent all around. Seemed like the staff was getting in the weeds with a private party and full bar, but smiles and friendliness always go a long way."}
{"text":"Nice location and feeling of environment BUT service on a slow day, Wed afternoon, is horrid where once an employee FINALLY appears on the outside patio every person reacts as a starving stepchild. Pleasant as pie once around but hope you don't get hungry or thirsty"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast or lunch, conveniently located smack in the middle of Old Montreal. The interior was classic and inviting, though you won't find many diners there on a nice day. The cute patio draws everyone outside on nice weather days.   Our breakfast was good, no complaints. My husband had the traditional English breakfast and I had eggs Benedict and yogurt. The yogurt was outstanding with apple sauce at the bottom and the hollandaise was some of the best I've had. It was so light like foam with a hint of lemon. I can never go back to gelatinous goopy hollandaise again. They did a great job with the potatoes too - not oily at all and very crispy exterior.   Service was excellent. Everyone from hostess to server to food runner was friendly and efficient. Bit of a tourist trap with the prices, but at least the food and location make up for it. Credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a coffee and they were cool enough to let us in despite closing for lunch. Tasty coffee, great spot facing the water. Would go there for a bite next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable brunch on the patio. My wife had the Sante with some small blueberry pancakes, poached eggs, spinach salad, and a yogurt parfait. I had the salmon Benedict - perfectly done. Tasty Bloody Marys too."}
{"text":"The food was lovely, and the service was great. It made for a lovely Saturday brunch."}
{"text":"Phenomenal brunch place (especially if you like eggs Benedict, coffee, breads, and fresh OJ... One of the best restaurants in Montréal."}
{"text":"Went here pre-New Year's eve on a recommendation I read from another review aggregation service.  I was with a loved one who has been to France (lived there for a year) and the overwhelming consensus was -- tres bon.  The purees here were amazing ( I mean who doesn't love lots of butter?)  We had a carrot puree that was simply out of this world.    The only downside (at least for me) was the appetizers we had were a bit small of a portion.  Maybe I'm an overstuffed American, but I like a few extra morsels with each starter.    Otherwise, fantastic.  And it's close to the water.  A great visit any time of the year."}
{"text":"Great spot right along the water front for grabbing a bite and having a few drinks. We ate here on a Thursday and there was a lively crowd and a DJ. The burger was terrific."}
{"text":"It's supposed to be a great place for brunches, but I've only tried the lunch menu. Overall the food is OK, but the servings are very small. The guys I went with must have eaten a snack right after. The fish course is always well prepared, but I tried a grilled veggie salad that was so disapointing (grilled onions, carrots and cauliflower with basically nothing else than a poached egg...kinda boring). It has a great terrace, so I'll most probably be back but just for drinks and oysters, or maybe brunch."}
{"text":"Came across this place on a recent visit to Montreal, just strolling by. Decided to stop in and grab a bite; had a delicious kale salad and my husband had the crab cakes; both were very good. Susan was our hostess and exceptionally helpful and sweet. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great place. They were closing, but kept it open so we could watch the end of the basketball game. Owner sat down and had drinks with us. Great vibe and live how they went above and beyond."}
{"text":"Un bel endroit dans un quartier touristique, mais qui offre une alternative bien fun aux brunchs : le partage !  Au menu, les classiques : bénédictines, complets... mais pour le coup servis sur une ardoise au milieu de la table, en plus grande quantité pour partager au lieu d'avoir chacun la même assiette. C'est chouette.  Petit hic pour le rapport quantité-prix quand on est habitué aux grosses assiettes, car là on est plus dans la recherche de la qualité. C'est très bon, ça change, mais les quantités ne sont pas folles. Le prix est un peu élevé mais nous mettrons ça sur le compte de l'emplacement.  Ah, et le petit jus d'orange pressé et le café compris dans le prix, c'est tout de même agréable.  Je recommande pour un brunch en amoureux tant l'endroit est intime et calme. Un bon moment savoureux !"}
{"text":"Country French cuisine served in a neo-industrial setting in waterfront Old Montreal? Throw in an expansive outdoor area, fantastic service and one of the best restaurant musical selections I have heard make this a fantastic experience.  Simple elegant cuisine (salads, pates,  cured cheeses, beautiful breads, roasted meats)  I feel horrible for forgetting the owners name, as he was exceptionally gracious.    Great bar as well.  My only regret is I didnt have time to come back."}
{"text":"Oh yum! Un des meilleurs brunchs en ville, sans aucun doute. Le concept est pas mal différent de toutes les autres places à déjeuner en ville. Ici, c'est le temps de la communion, donc, on y communione. Non, non. Pas de visite à l'église nécessaire!  En groupe, vous devez vous entendre sur le déjeuner que vous voulez (ou 2 pour les plus gros groupes), puis on vous emmène le tout au milieu de la table à partager comme si vous alliez bruncher chez un ami. Au menu, on a essayé le \"Classique\" qui consistait d'ufs brouillés, de fèves au lard et jambon confit au sirop d'érable, des p'tites patates, de la salade de fruits, des toasts avec confiture maison et formage de chèvre, puis des mini crêpes.  Inutile d'aller en trop de détails pour expliquer que tout était délicieux et qu'il y en avait plus qu'assez pour tout le monde. Le café régulier (un bon!) et un petit verre de vrai jus d'orange viennent avec le déjeuner. L'ambiance est absolument parfaite pour se moment de la journée et le décor, simplement joli.  La seule étoile qui manque est pour la rapidité du service. La bouffe est arrivée dans un temps très raisonnable, rapide même, et les serveurs étaient super polis et souriants, mais juste un peu trop occupés pour voir qu'on étaient assises depuis 10 minutes sans eau et sans café ou bien pour nous donner la facture alors que la table était complètement vide (incluant nos boissons). J'ai quand même hâte d'y retourner pour l'essayer encore!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  The staff is super friendly and just awesome. They have great drinks, great beer, a great location and wonderful attitudes.  I was in town on business last week with a couple of work colleagues and after convention, we wandered down to the waterfront looking for a sports bar to watch game seven of the Rockets-Clippers.   Surprisingly, we could not find any place with television. I walked into this place and I asked them if they knew any place with one.  They said that they had one but the people who normally are responsible for it were not there. But then they all got together and through some trial and error,  they were able to find the game I wanted and we were able to watch the final quarter.  Although they were not really fans of American basketball. They all got into it and watched the game with us.  It was a great way to end the day and I really appreciate their effort.    I look forward to visiting Montreal again and going back to Communion."}
{"text":"Très bel endroit, convivial, agréable, l'emplacement est super dans le Vieux devant Pointe à Callières. J'y suis allé plusieurs fois pour le lunch et une fois pour le souper. Tout est bon, le choix de vin est intéressant, l'atmosphère est relaxe. La cuisine est généreuse et bien exécutée.  Le service au lunch est peut-être un peu laborieux mais en soirée c'était très bien.  On y retourne certainement."}
{"text":"Communion is in the heart of Old Montreal, and with that comes a lovely patio setting, lots of people celebrating life events, tourists in fanny packs annnnd a slightly large price tag for what you're getting.   We had a nice little brunch here with friends to kick start a sunny Saturday in Montreal. I had a caesar and the English breakfast and enjoyed many of my friends' discarded freebie tang drinks. It was pretty average, but the giant patio and kind servers were exceptional. If I needed a last minute patio spot with a big group in MTL again, I'd definitely haul booty to Communion.  NB: They have bottomless mimosas for $30... a bit steep, but hey... still bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"Délicieux!  Had a great Sunday Brunch on a beautiful summer day in Old Montreal. The location can't be beat as it is right next to the Old Port; great for a stroll after stuffing yourself with eggs benedict. Their homemade (and complementary) orange juice was great, something I would never usually drink.  I would definitely return to sit out on their patio again and watch the horse drawn carriages go down the cobblestone streets."}
