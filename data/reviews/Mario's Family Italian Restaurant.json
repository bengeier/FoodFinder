{"text":"Excellent chicken romano and rolls and real garlic butter!  Atmosphere is relaxing and everything is reasonably priced.  Great service and smiling faces....just what I need after a long day at work."}
{"text":"We loved our meal tonight at Mario's! Started with dinner salads and a cup of the Soup of the Day, Cream of Asparagus with Roasted Peppers- SO DELICIOUS AND HEARTY!

My boyfriend had the Hot Sausage Casserole, which he really enjoyed- the tomato sauce was perfect and the sausage was very flavorful. I ordered the Linguini Puttanesca- absolutely delicious. We liked that the pasta wasn't drenched in sauce.

Our server was very sweet (the team service was great as well- many of the awesome ladies checked in on us during the meal) and attentive.

Support local businesses! Mario's is a gem!"}
{"text":"This was a great find.  My wife and I had an excellent Italian meal here.  Portions are great and the price is right.  Service was excellent also.  I would highly recommend.  You will not leave hungry and your pocketbook will not be broken.  Try it out."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5 PM for dinner on a Sat night, and we were promptly seated (they do not open a minute before). I was probably a tad underdressed as this is definitely a \"nicer\" restaurant. I had the veal parm with pasta. Food was excellent and a GREAT homemade marinara, but I must say I was a bit disappointed that for $18, my meal came with a choice of pasta OR salad. Seriously? Had to sit there while everyone else ate their salad, which I thought was awkward since we all ordered standard fare entrees. I've never heard of such a thing, and this is the reason for my downgraded review. That said, the service was great, food was fast and the meal was delicious along with the accompanying garlic rolls."}
{"text":"Almost a 4 star family restaraunt. Mixed feelings on the staff, some are great some aren't. Lots of wine on the menu from Italy but the wine list lacks any description other than varietal and brand. Menu hits the normal american version of italian food but with tradition and great sauce. It's a great place to take mom and dad and the kids."}
{"text":"Stopped by driving around looking for a restaurant.  My party ordered chicken parmesan, veal parmesan, and egg plant parmesan.  The rolls were excellent and warm,  crispy and a nice garlic butter.  I tried all of the entrees, and the breading and sauce were excellent.  I had Fettuccini Alfredo as a side.  I really enjoyed the noodles thickness and texture. Our server boxed up left overs and desert with a smile.   It was late when we stopped by (9pm) and we were welcomed and received top notch service."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place back in August when I had a dinner for work there. We were in the party room and it was all kinds of busy. Even with the full house, service was still very attentive. Food was delicious and it got us back now that me and my family have officially moved to Pittsburgh.

We went on a Monday night and it was a little less busy compared to our first visit. I got veal on both visits. The first time was Veal Marsala - amazing. This last visit was Veal Piccata - also amazing. No shortage of awesome with the capers. What can I say, I'm a sucker for capers.

So, this will be on our family's list of go to places for dining out. A great little neighborhood Italian restaurant tucked away in a little shopping plaza."}
{"text":"So good!  Real authentic Italian food just the way grandma made it in the old days!"}
{"text":"Great service. Old Italian feel kind of place. Portions are big and will def fill you up. They use real garlic which is rare now a days."}
{"text":"First time here tonight and it was delicious.  The fried zuchinni as an app was good.  My linguini with meatballs and marinara sauce was really good and a big portion where I took half of it home!  Prices were really reasonable for the portions we had!"}
{"text":"Really nice Italian food in Moon. Always crowded (for good reason) with welcoming wait staff.
The fried zucchini was just right - crispy and tender. The veal Romano was lovely. Another person at the table had the chicken Romano (objects to veal), which was good but not as good as the veal. My daughter finished her chicken cacciatore before I could even try it.
Cannoli was perfect. Tiramisu was pretty good, not the best.
A friendly place with great food!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  It's a small restaurant but nice and intimate for dining for business, with family, or for an event.  Veal and chicken are great. Nice size portions, great soups, and a children's menu that appeals to the kids!"}
{"text":"Good food, fun staff and large portions for very reasonable prices.  Expect to take food home, or split if you're traveling."}
{"text":"Tasty classic Italian food! Good atmosphere, sat at the bar, the bartender was very friendly. Would definitely go back and recommend to anyone on the area."}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious. I'll start off buy saying I sat at the bar (surprise surprise) my bar tender Leah was awesome! On top of her game with great charisma. 

Have to shout out the freedom martini... very good.
the beer selection was good. They also have a lot of wines and top shelf liquor. 

For dinner .... linguini putenesca ... cooked perfectly ! And more than enough food. I did not leave hungry. 

.....I shall return for more."}
{"text":"For someone who travels a lot. It is hard to find a good/great local Italian restaurant. I have to say, this place has fresh ingredients and favorable Italian ingredients. I had the portobello mushroom appetizer and egg plant parm. It was so good that I ordered a side of the pasta just to try it. The bar is nice. Not too busy. I enjoyed this stop. Fresh is good."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat! We're regulars here because we've always had a great experience. The food is amazing and the wait staff are really friendly. Great service and a huge selection! Our favorite little authentic Italian place! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sat at bar. Not great service. Had to wait while the regulars were kept entertained. Had to ask multiple times for a second glass of wine.  Ordered clams and capalini spicy. Repeated it twice and I received clams and linguini not capalini  and it was not spicy at all. Food was okay. Very heavy hand with the olive oil on everything from the bread, salad dressing and pasta gravy."}
{"text":"I had the tuna appetizer as a meal and it was just right. We sat outside. Was a nice night. Great service or maybe it was just the great company? Will have to go back to try it again.

Lobster mac and cheese looked interesting. Dumplings appetizer looked okay. Meatball seemed a bit lonely. Chicken dish (not sure of the name) was not a crowd pleaser. Burger seemed good. These comments are based on the reactions I saw and hear from others with me. One decided to just go with a martini for dinner. Next time I will pay more attention to the details or write the review a lot sooner after going."}
{"text":"Perfect dinner for four business colleagues. 
We were attracted by food reviews and now we have one of our own. Very authentic and your sever was friendly, attentive, respectful to our business conversation and her menu suggestions were the best. We had fun and spent 3 great hours there. BTW, your zucchini appetizer was best I ever had. If you want good food, Mario's will not disappoint."}
{"text":"My family had a reservation for five at Marios for 5 o'clock. When we arrived we were seated in a cold banquet room. When asked why we couldn't sit in the dining room the manager said they were busy. My sister said, we made reservations. The manager replied, very curtly,  \" they did too\" 
Our waitress , however, was very nice and apologetic. 
The food was disappointing. The pork chops too salty, salads very small and basic, sauce on spaghetti very basic- nothing special, coffee was served and it was cold. 
It was my sister's birthday- we should of left when we realized we had to sit alone in an empty banquet room-but my kids would have been embarrassed.
I will never return to this restaurant"}
{"text":"First visit and I will be back the next time I'm in town.  I asked the waitress which entree would bring me back for another visit and she recommended the pork chops. They offered these blackened.   These were presented over a baked potato covered with mushrooms and a gravy that was fabulous.  The pork chops were cooked to a perfect temperature and the seasoning brought my taste buds to life. 

Great job tonight Chef!"}
{"text":"Yelp surely told no lies on this one. This was hands down one of the top 3 Italian means of life! Starting with the bread...butter mercilessly dripping from the warm symphony of goodness. Tastefully adorned with heavenly bits of garlic. I could have just had the rolls. But I kept going.  The chicken soup was extremely well flavored. The Caesar salad was even memorable. It was a perfectly balanced blend of Romaine, croutons, parmesan and Caesar dressing. Yes, I know you know what a Caesar salad is. But literally every single one of the ingredients in the salad at Mario's was both distinct and cohesive at the same time. Again, I could have stopped there. But here comes the main ingredient. I had the Chicken Romano with a side of Fettuccini Alfredo. The Chicken Romano legit blew me away. At first I was a little dismayed that I followed the waitresses recommendation and steered away from my default dish, Chicken Parmesan. But the more I savored that goodness gracious, the more I knew that I was easily in the midst of eating my top 3 Italian meals of life. I'll remember that meal forever. And I will literally raise my hand and volunteer to go to Pittsburgh just to have an opportunity to eat Mario's again."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.

My business partners and I, ate here while in Pittsburgh on business. We found Mario's on Yelp.  Our first impression, based on the outdated fixtures, was that it wasn't going to live up go its 4-star rating.  Certainly, the restaurant can use a serious redecoration, which probably accounts for its aging clientele and sparse dining room on a Friday night at 8:00pm.

As for the food - it was nothing short of fantastic - cooked with a lot of love and care.  The \"greens & beans\" appetizer is not to be missed, as is the chicken Parmesan. 

As for the waitress... Well, let's just say she was as efficient as a computer - but shared about the same personality (none). She smiled only when it was time for us to pay the check... 

If you love Italian food - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decent Italian food, pasta portions are abundant, come with a salad, the fried zucchini were very good. 
Good value, I would classify as a decent American-Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"The décor is extremely dated.  The service was good with the exception of the wait staff at the drink filling station complaining about another table.  The drink station is in the open so everyone could hear.  Food was OK but, for the prices, it should have been excellent.  If you are going on a cold day, wear your coat.  They open at 5pm and I think they turn the heat on at 5:05pm."}
{"text":"Okay so I just moved to moon township about a year ago and I live walking distance from Mario's it took me almost a year to find myself going there.. boy I had been missing out, made from
Scratch Italian dishes are outstanding everything you get here is good from fish, steak, chicken, and soups to pork chops everything is good I recommend this highly. The pork chops I had were outstanding, and the chicken piccata my girlfriend had was stellar as well. All the guest I recommend this spot to at the hotel rave about it and have never said one Negative thing about it. If you want a nice homemade Italian dinner and a glass of wine This is your spot!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. I usually keep it kinda simple, enjoying their pasta and sauce. Always a treat. 
BTW- chicken soup is good too"}
{"text":"I might mirror one of the other reviews commenting the decor is dated, but I would add immaculate, and that is the only imaginable complaint.

We ordered take out while traveling through and staying at the airport. EXCELLENT food!!! Portions were right prices were right, and we loved the food.

There are some places in a neighborhood that just do things right without pretense. Off the beaten track, but easily worth the stop."}
{"text":"My favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. Very good Italian food and friendly service. Everything I have had here has been good."}
{"text":"Excellent food served from a great staff.great bread with chunks of real garlic. not far from airport definitely worth the ride"}
{"text":"Just had one of the best Italian meals in my life here.  The bread rolls are coated with fresh garlic and melted butter - oh so good.  And the seafood linguine featured calamari and clams in a red clam sauce.  It was delicious and the sauce was perfectly spiced and not greasy.  Portion was large but the food was too good not to finish in one sitting.  The service was also wonderful.  I liked that the waitress brought each kid a separate cup of water, without being asked, to go along with the lemonade we ordered for them.  And the kids enjoyed their kids meals (which were also generously proportioned) as much as I enjoyed mine."}
{"text":"This place was great! Went here with my family on a Wednesday night.

Best way to describe it - old school Italian. 

The best thing ever rolls in garlic & butter

Table had fried zucchini as an appetizer and it was excellent. 
Had the potato & bacon soup. Amazing 
Had the fettuccine & meatballs. Sauce and pasta was also amazing. Meatballs were good.

Parents had the veal and fettuccine Alfredo and they loved it.

Place served amazing food and the portions are HUGE.

Eat here if you have an opportunity."}
{"text":"Awesome food! This place offers authentic Italian food or sure. After a long road trip and crappy happy meals parade, I wAs looking for a nice home made food. 

The hotel I stayed in suggested this place. Something local, family biz, good quality...I was game.

Everything I tried was good, from appt to desert....Special of the day was really nice.

Price was about $50pp incl a beer, an appt, main, and desert. 

Seems next door is there party room, so be sure to ask them about group deal...

Will go back again."}
{"text":"Hotel shuttle dropped me off at Mario's for dinner. I ate at the bar and had a pleasant conversation w Missy.
Food was good and authentic Italian w an excellent wine selection.
I will return"}
{"text":"My husband and I are not restaurant aficionados, but we've been around.  I like supporting local businesses, so when we won a gift card at a raffle we stopped in to use it.

The wait seemed a bit long for a table, but it was a weekend and we didn't think to call ahead for reservations so we cut them some slack there.  It was nice to see a decent number of families, and knowing the place was family friendly was a positive (our kids were visiting with Grama at the time).

Once we were seated, we saw about 1/3 of the tables were empty which was odd.  It took almost 10 minutes for our server to finally come over, and she must've had at most 3 other tables.  Again, we are not too picky and spent time doing waitstaff/kitchen work when we were younger, so we kept a positive attitude.  Our appetizer came out quickly, but was very tiny for the price.

Our dinners took a half hour to come out after we finished the appetizer, and we ordered only a steak salad and meatball sandwich.  I could've made them from scratch myself at home quicker than that.  The meatball sandwich was pretty good and about as expected, but the salad was VERY tiny for $10, and had only about 4 pieces of lettuce under all the fries and steak.  The steak was ordered medium, but was very well done and super chewy.  It didn't taste like a strip steak as the menu stated. The dressing was not mixed well so half the salad tasted half like olive oil and the other half balsamic vinegar (it came in a black cup so you couldn't tell before pouring).  I like fries on my salad, but there were way too many.  And no bread- either on the table or with our dinners.  I have definitely never been to an Italian restaurant where they don't give you bread, or at least one small roll with your meal!

We got our bill decently quickly after, and were happy because we were ready to go after being there nearly 2 hours considering the time we arrived before being seated.  We spent $42+ tip on two small dinners, one appetizer, and 2 drinks.  I think it was extremely overpriced for the small amount of food we received. 

Our gift card from the raffle came in a sleeve stating it was $25, but the waitress said only $15 was on it.  We never, ever order drinks (thanks to the drink tax and general cost of beverages from restaurants), and only did because we thought we had $25 credit.  Not the waitresses fault so we didn't stiff her or anything- but pretty shoddy business practice to donate gift cards to charitable events, then not put the amount of money on them you claim.  We waited to try and talk to someone about it for 10 minutes at the front desk area before finally giving up and just saying 'let's forget about ever being here.'

It was probably one of the overall worst restaurant experiences we've ever had, and we will not be back.  There are a lot of good reviews for this place, so maybe we just had bad luck with the arrival time and the staff there that particular night."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! The Garlic Shrimp is the best thing ever! All dishes have been perfect! We probably go there once or twice a week and are always pleased with the food and the service! Definately give it a try!"}
{"text":"I had veal marsala and salad at the bar. Service  was very fast and good.  Veal pieces were small but tender and nice fresh  mushrooms.  The garlic bread if you call it that was not good. It was a roll drenched in oil and sprinkled with garlic. Salad was ok."}
{"text":"A doughy, but excellent crust leads to an incredible slice of pizza. I personally had the pepperoni and I couldn't get enough of it."}
{"text":"What a great meal with very friendly staff. Traveling from out of town so had dinner at the bar. The bartender/waitress was the best! She was quick with drinks and conversation. Had the appetizer of stuffed hot peppers - not too hot but great taste. The meal also was wonderful!  To top off the night we had the tiramisu shot. A definite repeater for me!"}
{"text":"This place was very unexpected! After picking me up from the airport, my husband suggested grabbing dinner nearby, and we found ourselves in uncharted (for us) territory -- Coraopolis. We passed by Mario's and decided to give it a whirl, but I have to admit that I was totally judging it before I even stepped inside. To be fair, it's in this small strip mall thing, and does not look like a nice restaurant from the outside. Although it actually doesn't look much better on the inside...it's pretty dated and comes across as very \"Old Pittsburgh.\" 

However, this is exactly why you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, because the food here is pretty awesome. It's definitely a classic \"red sauce\" kinda American-Italian place, which I dig...large menu, generous portions, and delicious food. The chicken parm I had was on point...if an Italian restaurant can nail this classic dish, I'm a repeat customer! They also start every meal with these fresh rolls topped with garlic and butter that are little slices of heaven (little buns of heaven?) Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the service...both the hostess and server were super attentive, friendly, and warm. They really make you feel welcome here! It's kinda like Olive Garden's \"When you're here, you're family\" idea (except the food isn't terrible like Olive Garden). Anyway, I'll definitely be back next time I'm in that neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"We just had my brother's Surprise 60th Birthday dinner at Mario's Family Italian Restaurant. The pre planning with a Sue was a wonderful experience and our server that evening was superior. All the guests commented on how great the food was and that the room layout was enjoyable. I live in California and the restaurant was a recommendation from my Uncle who lives locally. Great food, service and atmosphere. I enclosed a photo of our menu so you can see the entrees we selected. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and very good service. We went to Mario's on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was completely full. This  in its own is a testimony for the quality of the food served at Mario's"}
{"text":"Forget Olive Garden, Mario's Family Restaurant is the best dining experience this side of the Mississippi. Get this: we gave them the wrong number of people, and Sue still seated us, at a table fit for kings. She promptly let us know that our server (Deanna, an angel) would be with us shortly. Deanna brought us a heaping platter of golden footballs in a pool of liquid gold (read: the softest, warmest rolls you can imagine bathed in butter and garlic). Against all odds, the hand of God (Deanna) sensed we needed a second serving, and immediately brought them to our table. Suddenly, we got a taste of culture:

(Enter Deanna, stage left)
Deanna - Are you ready to order?
Us - (We order (described in more detail below), including 2 pasta fah-gee-olis (or so we thought))
(Deanna exits, returns incredibly promptly with our soups and appetizers)
Deanna - Here are your pasta fagioli! (pronounced fah-jewel) 

We also ordered a mouth-watering fried provolone wheel, scrumptious portabella mushrooms, heavenly cheese ravioli (from the secret menu, that Sue (hostess) clued us in on), supremely tasty linguini aglio olio, vegetarian pasta Romano (from a section of the menu called \"For our vegetarian friends\" - which we appreciated and felt welcomed by!) and yummy spaghetti with meatballs and mushrooms thrown in for free. This was the type of food that you want to make room for (TIMBER). We thought we were done - but no. Another waitress carried a delectable chocolate cake past our table, and Deanna knew immediately that we needed it. She brought us this spectacular dessert masterpiece (the \"chocolate eruption\" a.k.a. choc erup) with 5 forks and - get this - a complementary glass bottle of milk.

At the end of the meal, she proposed separate checks - as if things couldn't get any better! It came out to around $20 a person, everything included. We left a generous tip, but Mario's left us with the experience of a lifetime. Needless to say, if we are ever traveling cross PA again, we will certainly be stopping at Mario's!!"}
{"text":"Seated promptly, drink and meal orders taken and served right away. Entree came out too quickly while I had just started my salad. House salad/dressing were ok. Roll was very nice, drenched in butter and garlic. I got linguini, red sauce and spicy sausage. Good sauce, pasta cooked just right and the sausage was great. I was surprised the pasta was cooked correctly since it came out early but is was good. I'd return!"}
{"text":"Ate here again last night for a business dinner - OH SO YUMMY! I had the same thing as on the other review and the guys had basic spaghetti with tomato basil sauce and veal Romano. Excellence again. Exceptional!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Calamari was undercooked and Veal was a small portion. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This little place is awesome!!! The staff is so friendly and the chef actually will walk around making small chit chat to inquire if you enjoyed your food, if they aren't too busy. 
The food is excellent. This is a great date place or a great place to bring out of town guests. 
We really enjoyed the Sunday Brunch after church too. The girls always have a smile and when we came in with 3 toddlers they were so so accommodating."}
{"text":"My first time at Mario's was all around pleasant. The appetizer was amazing. We got the Bravo Mario which consisted of a selection of Italian meats and cheeses and seasoned olives. The garlic butter rolls were topped with real butter and real garlic and we asked for seconds. The entire table ordered the Chicken Romano and though it did not particularly suit my taste it was quite good. The breading on the chicken was perfect and the meat itself was precisely cooked and tender. VERY generous portions. Each person at our table chose a different dessert and each one sampled the others. The wait staff (particularly Darlene) is attentive and pleasurable. Will return soon."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying the service was great however, the food was disgusting. The garlic bread are rolls with melted butter and garlic chunks thrown on top of the roll. We ordered two pasta dishes and the pasta was cooked well but the sauces were gross. Almost tasted spoiled. We only could get a couple bites before feeling grossed out. This may be \"good food\" for the Pittsburgh area but if you're from a place with true good food like New York, AVOID!"}
{"text":"Decor?  Who cares.  Service is fast and friendly.  They make you feel welcome.  And the food is tremendous.  Really delicious Italian food.  Mario's is on my regular run!  Did I say, great food!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Moon, hands down!  The price is a little higher than Armstrong's, but the quality is much better.  Never had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"This is truly a mom and pop Italian restaurant. Huge plates of well made food (no Prego sauce here) in a very casual family restaurant.

Come here expecting good American Italian cuisine and you won't be disappointed. 

While nothing was amazing everyone was satisfied with their meals, and they even offered some gluten free options. While this isn't your high end, locally sourced, made from scratch restaurant, it is a good causal restaurant for decent Italian food."}
{"text":"On a recent trip home to visit my brother and see a Steelers game, we went to Mario's. Although not exactly the ambiance of the old restaurant, the food was excellent. The wait staff was warm and courteous. I strongly recommend a visit to this fine restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because I like to support small businesses. We went on a Monday so service was quick and we got our appetizer right away. The calamari was overcooked and rubbery, but flavor-wise the tomato basil sauce that came with it was excellent. 

Everything else we had was overseasoned to the point that it was tough to eat. I wanted to water down everything I had to lessen the intensity, which is probably what I'll have to do in order to eat the leftovers we have. I would give this place another chance based on the other reviews here if I was a local in case this was just an off-day. Unfortunately, I'm not a local and I was left with a bad first impression."}
{"text":"Very solid. Everything was delish, the bread was drizzled with butter and garlic. Chicken park was cooked well, salad was not over dressed. Our server, Ashley, was very kind and on top of things. They looked to have a pretty extensive wine list and a full bar."}
{"text":"Its ok. Kind of disappointed. Really wanted the pasta but after ordering the beef and mushroom ravioli was kind of turned off to the \"al dentè\" and salty flavoring. The bread, on the other hand, was TOO DIE FOR. Freshly baked, puffed little buns brushed with garlic on top and heavy on the melted butter. Mmmmm mm!

I also ordered a Caesar which was authentic but nothing too amazing. It was heavy on the dressing and had a funky taste to it - maybe it was the anchovies or maybe it was me. We had a large crowd too which they had trouble accommodating it seemed and things were sort of scattered. 

I probably won't come back, personally as a choice but at least now I know."}
{"text":"this is a decent neighborhood Italian place. Food is OK - a bit salty and not spectacular but fine for a meal out during the week. I eat here periodically  when in town for business. That is the kind of place it is - go out for dinner with the family or out on business. It's not 5 star. Don't expect it. Just solid and decent food at a reasonable price. Best part is it is convenient and the food is pretty good. Worst part was getting hit on by the 60 year old lady at the bar last time i was there (I'm 42 - so it was a little creepy)."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and attentive. Atmosphere is acceptable, they are not trying too hard like Oil Garden, I mean Olive Garden, but you still know it's Italian restaurant with the wines and other items indicating as such.

We ordered calamari and the zucchini appetizers, both were very good and I would recommend.

I tried the steak salad, it was very good with the Italian dressing. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals with Italian sausage spaghetti, eggplant parmigiana, and fettuccine alfredo. Prices are not too bad.

Waitress was friendly and attentive to drink needs and wants.

Good experience. Would return."}
