{"text":"I'm gonna make this short. Food is good. I like their honey chicken in particular. Service is not the best. On the phone they are friendly however they are not so in person. This being on many different occasions. I would have gone there more often if they were more friendly."}
{"text":"Golden Chopsticks has improved greatly over the last number of years. They reworked the kitchen staff and it really shows.  This Glatt Kosher Chinese restaurant offers a large menu. They also have a few Curry and Thai dishes.   I am a huge fan of their General Tao Chicken. It is very addictive! They also do an excellent Curry Chicken. I don't care for their fried rice dishes, but that is a minor problem. Their homemade-in-the-store spring rolls make up for it.   This is mostly a take-out place, but there is a small eat-in area. The decor is not bad, but usually a lot of newspapers laying around.  They can do Chabad meat if you request it."}
{"text":"Food has gone downhill. Used to be a 10/10. Wonton soup was off, chicken dish was sour, and vegetables were mushy and tasteless. Used to order many times in the past and loved the food, but after last experience will not go back."}
{"text":"Food was fast and cheap but the service was a little unfriendly. I guess if you want something quick and easy, go for it.  The food was fine, not great. They put an awful lot of sesame seeds on my chicken and everything tasted sort of altogether, flavourless. For General Tao chicken, it wasn't even spicy or tangy at all.  The place was also someone cluttered. The menu has a hundred different items going on at once but it is cool that they have meal deals on a sheet in front of you, just in case what you want is a simple dish. I might try it one more time just to get a better scope of an opinion but for now I'll just say you could probably find a better place to get your rice and noodle fix."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but some of the sauces tend to be on the sweet side.  the prices are not too high. they have good deal on lunches during the week.  It's not the best chinese food I've ever eaten, but not the worst."}
{"text":"Boy has this place gone down hill. It would seem that they are increasing their margins by serving up dishes that are predominantly deep fried batter, with barely a vegetable in sight. The food is heavy, deep fried, unappetizing in appearance. Every dish tastes the same no matter which one you order.  The sweet and sour sauce for the chicken balls had hardly any sauce in the container and what was there was so watered down it was virtually a tasteless liquid. Save your money and your stomach by avoiding this place."}
{"text":"The ONE thing I can write positively about this place is the diversity of food that is offered. There is a lot and for the most part it is generally edible too. I enjoy their spring rolls and General Tao's Chicken and it pretty much ends there.  (Don't continue to read if you don't want to read negative comments)  Where to begin? Yes, the food is Asian and for the most part there are Asian spices used in their cooking but for anyone who has stepped foot into an authentic Chinese restaurant or has eaten in China would know that Chinese cuisine is more than noodles and breaded chicken in different sauces. I'd give them credit for this move because it allows them to cook multiple dishes at once and interchange with sauces. By the way, having Asian staff in the backroom cook DOES NOT EQUAL authentic Chinese food.  That however leads me into my next point. I was at this \"restaurant\" if you want to call it that over Mother's day. I called at 5PM to place my order and was told it would be a wait of an hour until I could pick it up. When i got there, there was a line up of people (About 6 or more) who were all told to come in at 6PM to get their food. I ended up getting it half an hour later. I find that completely unacceptable and there were no apologies or accountability on the staff for the tardiness of the service. All I'm saying is that if you are in the restaurant business you'd forecast Mother's Day as a big day and one would prepare ahead for such a day so dishes could be knocked out quicker.  Avoid this place if possible but then again there aren't that many Asian Kosher restaurants in Toronto. It's a shame really, it kind of makes me want to open up my own place if I had the time to run it. Unfortunately, I only have the time to whine about it."}
{"text":"NEW CHEF!  We used to order large meals from this place quite frequently. It was definitely considered the best kosher Chinese food in town, and offered a very wide selection. Recently however, we ordered the same dishes we usually do and something tasted very different. The meat was tougher, the spicy peanut beef wasn't as spicy and the breaded chicken dishes weren't as flavorful. I wasn't enjoying myself.   I was later told by my brother in law (who shared the same experience) that the chef was replaced by someone else. Awful.   Long story short,  I won't go back."}
{"text":"We ordered pick up from Golden Chopsticks. They feature Glatt Kosher chinese food, and it's pretty good. Dishes we had include sesame chicken, lemon breaded chicken, and a series of noodle dishes. The beef and chicken tasted pretty standard for chinese takeout fare.   Highlights: - Plain chicken wings - Lemon breaded chicken"}
