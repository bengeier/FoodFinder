{"text":"Was born in glassport and this was the Chinese food I grew up on. Its the best!!!! Meling the owner has been there since I was born probably (25 years) fresh great food. Portions are huge and for the price u can't beat it. Wayyyyy better and fresher than Golden Gate up in Clairton that's for sure!!"}
{"text":"We walked in and weren't even sure if they were open. My group had to search for someone to serve us. The food is sub par - average at best."}
{"text":"Been going to China Park for years best general so's around. Never had a bad meal and reasonably priced. Only con would be no buffet, but means food is cooked to order very fresh. Family owned very nice atmosphere. Also cash only!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch based on the Yelp reviews. We had the daily lunch specials, the portions were Larter enough for two so come hungry. Service was fast and friendly for a Saturday afternoon. The General Taos chicken was very good. All in all a good experience"}
{"text":"Ive been coming to China Park since i was a little boy and it is undoubtedly the best place to get Chinese food in Pa. Service is great, and it is often very quiet and calm. The General Tso's Tofu is great (especially for vegans like myself)! This place has been a staple in the glassport community for many years and i hope it stays that way. I always look forward to dining here with friends for lunch!"}
{"text":"The best chinese food around. As a vegetarian I love the fact they have multiple tofu dishes, including general tso tofu. The cheese wontons are a must. They have lunch specials during the week before 2 that come with soup or an egg roll. Come hungry because the serving portions are huge. My daughter and I usually split one meal. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Food is unbelievably good. The decor is the same as it has been for 20+ years, but who cares? It's clean. There's one waitress and one cook, that's it! Consistency will never be an issue at this place. CASH ONLY!!! I would highly recommend going here to anyone."}
{"text":"Portions for the next day and as good as the food is day one the leftovers always seem to be better. Been eating here for years and I never left unsaturated. Egg rolls are a meal alone and they are stuffed with flavor. Soups are fantastic. Never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"This place has very good prices, large portions, and good General Tso's! 

I would recommend going high on the spice level for the Tso's, otherwise you may find the sauce to be a bit sweet without any heat. 

It's cash only so keep that in mind. If you work in the area it's a great place for lunch. Lunch plates are ~$7 including a bowl of soup!"}
{"text":"Last minute decision to get Chinese food. Came here, the wonton soup was delicious! The egg roll huge and loaded with shrimp. And even though both of our orders were good, I didn't think this was a szechwan sauce that's thicker, dark reddish-brown. This was thinner, lighter  huge portions, just order one meal, it can be split between two or three people! More pricy than other Chinese restaurants but you get tons of food."}
{"text":"Ok time for a real review. 3 stars....  im not from Glassport. I was here for a stay and i love Chinese food. Im from the San Francisco area. A place that has Chinese food so good it makes the Chinese govt. angry at us. Im not a Ch. food snob but i ve eaten at plenty so....  heres an outsiders view of this place. 
Was craving Chinese food so I Decided to give this place a try after driving by dozens of times. I did a phone order not knowing what the menu looked like and ordered the basic stuff. They apparently only had one size item, large. So I decided to keep my order short and order pork chow mein and beef and broccoli. I ordered two eggrolls for appetizer to try and that was it. She told me it would take 15 to 20 minutes which it did it was basically ready when I got there. The bill was pretty high for one person it was more than I'm going to tell you because if my wife reads this I'll be in trouble. So I sat at the bar waiting a few minutes for my food and lo and behold they have a full bar. That's pretty awesome. I grabbed a to go menu for the next time so I'd have a better idea of what to order. I paid the lady and she was very nice but there wasn't a soul in the restaurant and it was I think 7 PM. One thing I can say is that the nationality of the what appeared to be owners was correct. That's not what I expected so that was a bonus. All in all the place was fine.  It was old but I've been to plenty old Chinese food restaurants and most of them are pretty darn good so I didn't really care about that.
Now the food. I started with the eggrolls. They were huge. I've had smaller burritos! Holy moly. I should have only gotten one and they were only two dollars each. But they were good so I ate them both. When I reached in the bag I found these little fried wonton things kind a like skinny chips so I ate a few of those.  my beef and broccoli came with white rice and the chow mein appeared to come with no noodles which it said it had crispy noodles. That's with those little wonton things were. I've never had those before like that, kind of strange but it was fine. I did add my rice and these crispy wonton things to the chow mein.  it was good. The pork was good and there were lots of vegetables in both of the entr√©es. Both were good. But they were huge just like the egg rolls. I should have had two friends to help me. Had I been staying here longer I would have had seconds and thirds, leftovers for days. It came with fortune cookies soy sauce, duck sauce and hot mustard. No chopsticks but that was fine. All in all the food was good. I only gave it three stars because it wasn't the best I've ever had it definitely wasn't the worst, it was kind of middle-of-the-road, still good. Better than I expected for this town. All in all I would go back though I would recommend to the restaurant to offer a few dinner combos or dinner specials for the single person that wants to try a few different things and not break the bank. They do have lunch specials which are priced fairly reasonably."}
{"text":"Excellent food ,gr8 service, The special wonton soup is the best. Food is always fresh and delicious. Love it. Best Chinese restaurant in the area. If your super hungry the portions are huge.Dont forget to order an egg roll or two. Their the BEST.."}
{"text":"Got lunch to go here today for two. The General Tso chicken was so hard the plastic fork couldn't penetrate it. Like a rock. Only ate the rice & sauce. The chicken lo mein was just ok but pretty oily. Would not recommend this place."}
