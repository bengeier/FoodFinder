{"text":"For the first two visits when they were newly opened in April, it took a while to be seated and the food came out frustratingly slowly. They were nice however (pop was on the house, and there was discount), but service wasn't that great as they often kept forgetting our orders. However in light of this, they got their act together.  Now they are quite fast and $10.99 is as good as you can get for   Japanese all you can eats. For $3 more you can order up to 12 pieces of sashimi. Unlike Sushi on 7 they allow you to order dragon rolls and sashimi during lunch so the whole menu is open to you even at lunch.  The unbeatable value at $10.99 even holds for weekday and weekend as well as lunch and dinner. You can also determine how much Sashimi you want, 12 pieces for every $3 and $8 per person for unlimited.  If Japanese food is not your taste they also have dimsum for $1-$2 per plate and Chinese lunch combos for under $5.  Unbeatable value, good food and fast service with a very good variety of food."}
{"text":"I dined at Takara House to celebrate a friend's birthday.  All together we were a group of 15+.  We placed a reservation ahead of time and had no problems getting a table when we arrived at the reservation time around 8:00 p.m..  So far so good, but not for long...    The food itself was decent overall, with some items being more decent than others, such as the butterfish and octopus sashimi.  The seafood soup and miso soups were rather weak in taste, almost as if an original soup was diluted with water.  The sashimi (the little that was brought to us) was fresh and par for the course at an AYCE restaurant.  The sushi and maki were too loaded with rice, which is unfortunately also the norm at these sort of establishments.  The tempura was fried nicely but not battered evenly, with clumps of fried batter on parts of the items.  The beef short rib (which is inaccurately named \"veal chop\" on the English menu) was actually quite good, with lots of flavour and not over-marinated or over-cooked.  Its sad to say, but the mediocre food was the least of my problems at Taraka House.  The service was absolutely deplorable. The staff of Takara House together delivered what was probably one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had at an AYCE restaurant.  The main problem was with the delay in food and how little food we actually received.  While basic items arrived pretty quickly - such as drinks, soup, salad, and ice cream - it seemed as though they were trying extra hard not to bring us anything else we requested. Time and time again our orders were either lost or arrived in much smaller quantities than we had asked for.  For example we started with an order that included 30 pieces of scallop sashimi - only 3 pieces were brought to us.  We tried to send in multiple small orders of 40-50 pieces of food but sadly this did not help us get any more food.  Parts of our initial order were brought to our table almost 2 hours after being seated.  It should be noted that while all our sushi and maki orders arrived eventually, the majority of our sashimi orders did not - it just so happens that their sushi and maki were very imbalanced in the rice:seafood ratio (favouring the rice, naturally).  This issue was compounded by the fact that the customer service itself from the staff was extremely poor.  The waitress must have not been in a good mood or something as she seemed to be scowling each time she came to take an order. One time someone asked if they had Coke available to drink. She replied with a terse \"yes\" and then walked away (without asking if we wanted one, which we did).  Another time the table next to us waved her over to take some drink orders but when it became clear to her that they wanted more than 1-2 drinks she yelled at them \"write it down!\"  Last but not least, she definitely subscribed to the \"try not to look any customer in the eye\" school of table waiting.  At 10:00 p.m. we were told that it was last call. Because most of the food we had ordered had not arrived, we entered in a very large order of sashimi (250+ pieces) to make up for this. At first we were told by waitress that the restaurant had run out of salmon and octopus (even though we could plainly see the salmon in the case at the sushi station).  Not long afterwards the chef came out to our table and unkindly told us that we were being unreasonable by entering such a large order at closing as the staff wanted to go home.  When we protested that we had done this because we were still missing a lot of food from earlier orders, he assured us that all our previous orders would be filled.  This proved not to be the case as only a couple more items were brought out, including one more plate of sashimi (1 of at least 3-4 orders), before the kitchen closed.  Needless to say, the majority of us went home unsatisfied by the quantity of food that night.  The smart ones filled up on some McDoubles and Jr Chickens.  Taraka House - not much of an all-you-can-eat experience.  P.S. It should be noted that this experience was shared by the table next to us, even though they were seated before us.  They were getting their food 90 minutes after the order was placed and did not received as much food as they wanted.  TL; DR: absolutely terrible service and stingy AYCE business practices, not overcome by the decent food and low price.  Much better AYCE can be found elsewhere in town."}
{"text":"The place is quite decent, but it is kind if strange for me that a sushi house has Chinese food and dumdum in the menu.  So it actually gives me a strong feeling that it is not authentic .  Second thing that quite disturb me is the music they played here is all Mandarin songs. It may better to play plain music or Japanese.  Many Chinese operated sushi houses have the same problem here: play Chinese songs in Japanese restaurant. Weird!    For the sushi itself, it is ok. But the rice is still very warm when I eat them, and the fish is not cold enough.   For the deep fried tofu, so-so, I don't like the smell of the oil, seems like it is not so fresh.   For the beef onion roll, it tastes bad because it is not fresh, and a bit sour too."}
{"text":"Takara House is  a Japanese restaurant that is newly opened at the plaza at Kennedy and Bur Oak.   I was attracted to go into Takara House because of all those Soup Noodle Specials for $5.99 with a drink.. but I ended up having their AYCE lunch. I guess I am up selling myself, but I have glad of my decision..because the Ramen/Noodle here is Meh....   Lunch AYCE is $11.99.. which I was more than happy to pay but then I was given a 10% off card..and then 15% off when I pay... I could not say NO to discount! :)   The selections here is quite good... with the usual rolls, sushi and some hot plates... I ended up ordering:   Hand Roll: Spicy Scallops/Salmon   Roll: Black Dragon Roll   Sushi: Fish Roe/Spicy Salmon   Tempura: Shrimp/Yam/Pumpkin (a little soggy and some pieces are stale)   Ramen: Seafood (which suppose to have Kombu broth)   Green Tea Ice cream   The shari rice was done surprisingly good.. with good bite and soft inside.. can put in a little more rice vinegar though...   Ramen is the weakness... the noodle itself was cooked too soft... and the stock broth doesn't have much flavour (even the owner has concern and asked me about it!!)   Since Takara House just opened recently...I can tell the owner is really passionate and wanting the business to success... He was really  sincere and nice greeting all his customers."}
