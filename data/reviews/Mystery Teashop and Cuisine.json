{"text":"Call them before coming because the hours listed might be wrong. We came on a Sunday afternoon and both yelp and the sign on their door said it should be open during those hours, but it wasn't. We drove out waay of our way to come here and we were pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Good quality bubble tea, the price is not too expensive but the flavor is excellent!! Not too sweet but yet very refreshing!! 

The food is absolutely wonderful!! They put enough effort into their dishes to make me give them a five star!! A must try!!"}
{"text":"This place is not mysterious and it feels like a normal bubble tea place with some board games to play. The service was not bad and the food was okay/decent. Not a very memorable place and probably will not go again or recommend to friends. Also, it was really odd how the bill was given to us on an ipad =/. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"The teashop is located at  a not so popular plaza, guess that is why not many customers which also that is what i want too. the sofa seat is really comfy and the bartender/waiter is polite and cute =). food and drinks are average, i recommend the provence bubble tea. pirces are same as other bubble tea shops. but since a quite and cozy place is what i was looking for, if i wanna chill with freinds i will definitely choose this place over those popular and packed bubble tea places."}
{"text":"There is no mystery at Mystery Cafe.

Another bubble tea place where you can get overpriced bubble tea, eat some unhealthy snack and chit chat with your friends.

Noise level can be high from the music and for this particular afternoon two guys gossiping their way at the top of their voice over some extra large bbt. 

Deep Fried Pork Cutlet ($4.99) and Iced Lychee Red Tea ($3.99) were surprisingly good. Pork was tender and crispy and tea without overly sweet but still have nice flavour.

Mystery Cafe is a decent option if you want to have a quick snack or just chill out a little."}
