{"text":"It was great to be able to get the fried rice made with brown rice, though an extra $3 seemed a little steep for the privilege.  The shrimp with mixed veggies was delicious and a big hit with my 18 month old and 3 year old.  The moo goo gai pan was disappointing, bland with too little chicken and far too many mushrooms.  
Overall, this place was just ok.  The dishes were hit or miss.  I'd go back for the shrimp though."}
{"text":"They have some of the best Chinese food I've ever had!!! The service was outstanding as well!!! Hands down was the best wonton soup I've ever eaten!!! If you live close by, stop and eat!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't yet reviewed this place!  It's the most convenient Chinese to my house and we'll stop every couple of months.

Food is acceptable but there's nothing memorable to rate it as great.  Our household usually gets a chicken dish, a beef dish and a seafood dish.  Everything we've ordered has been pleasantly good.  Dad raves about the hot and sour soup.

Service is ok.  There is no separate area in which to wait for a take out order, you have to wait in a dining room booth near the front door.  Tonight, that was a pretty chilly spot to sit!

Pricing seems high so this brings down the value ratio (OK food, high prices = lower value).  Portion sizes are good so at least we get a couple of meals out of each order.

If I have a choice, I go up Park Road to Shanghai.  But if I want convenience, it's Amazing Wok."}
{"text":"Delivery was timely, food was delicious and the amount I received for the price I paid was way more than expected. Will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Reliably delicious and reasonably priced. Fast and friendly service as well. I've been there more times than I care to count and I can't say that I've had much to complain about.  Highlights for me are their Double Sautee'd pork and General Tso's Chicken. The wonton soup broth can sometimes be inconsistent depending on who's cooking that particular night."}
{"text":"Great place to have a quiet lunch.  Sit down and enjoy some good food!  Great staff!  Very friendly and relaxing location."}
{"text":"1st time I ever tried this place and the only reason I gave it 1star was because the delivery guy was fast and courteous.
I ordered pepper steak which had a horrible taste and was hard to chew like beef jerky 
I also ordered the General Tso shrimp which was below average taste and the sauce was very watered down 
along with over cooked vegetables the rice looked and tasted like it was half steamed half fried rice
I ate very little and threw it in the garbage"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Best quality Chinese in the area, and the workers are very friendly too! Their amazing chicken is the best. Like this place MUCH better than MeKong's, which is around the corner. We are always very pleased when we order from Amazing Wok"}
{"text":"I challenge you to find me better tasting Chinese food in Pittsburgh that's portioned as generously and priced as reasonably.

I've patronized this establishment on average about once a week for the last 2 years of living in the Brookline/Dormont area and I've only been disappointed once or twice, when \"they\" forgot my egg roll or I realized I neglected to mention I wanted my chicken with mixed vegetables steamed (so that second time was my fault).  Whether I do take-out or delivery, it's typically ready within 15 minutes or arrives at my door within 30 minutes.

The only criticism I have is that sometimes the woman who runs the place might come across as a little \"cold,\"  but I perceive that as she's just really that busy and trying to be as efficient as possible.  She's not rude or anything, says \"please\" and \"thank you\" and whatnot, but she can make me feel sometimes like I'd better hurry up and tell her what I want, which really, I don't mind, but I can see might be an issue for some people who want to be doted on and get a full-blown customer service experience.  So keep in mind she's not there to kiss butt.  She's there to get you some amazing Chinese food.

Seriously, do yourself a favor and go.

PS-  Most of their food is served in recyclable containers, so they're environmentally conscientious-- wash 'em out & recycle!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Simple, clean and a nice service. The food is tasty and the prices are absolutely fair. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fresh cooked Chinese food in the Ballantyne area"}
{"text":"Had a craving for Chinese and based on other reviews I thought I'd give it a try.  I almost went somewhere else thinking this place wasn't open - the windows are mirrored and the Open sign was there but it was a sunny day so i couldn't tell it was lit... So I waited and to my relief someone walked out with a bag of food.  Ordered a bunch of take out and it was ready very quick.
$35 for 3 meals, soup and 2 egg rolls. All the dishes are exactly as I come to expect from an (American) Chinese joint. 
Ample parking; the place wasn't crowded at all for a Friday evening. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"If there is an Asian restaurant in Ballantyne that I can count on it is this place. Me & the wife go here to eat dinner a lot more than all the other Asian places in Ballantyne and it's consistent consistent consistent consistent."}
{"text":"Really not that amazing. Only dying here once so possibly they were off.  I've had better cafeteria Chinese food."}
{"text":"Used to love this place what happened?  The general tso's Used to be so good not so much anymore.  Some of the chicken pieces  in the meal were so large you need a knife to cut them in threes.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"There is nothing \"amazing\" about Amazing Wok's service. Ordered shrimp Chow Mein for takeout. Got home and opened up a bowl of chicken and cabbage. Called them back and the guy argued with me about how Chow Mein is not noodles and then finally agreed to take it back and switch the order. He ended the call by rudely stating to 'order the right thing next time'.  No my friend, there will not be a next time. Regardless if he felt I ordered the wrong thing, how do you explain the wrong protein? His response was completely unacceptable. Happy New Years.

Update to my original review: I have since received an apology message regarding the experience which I did appreciate and tells me they take customer service seriously."}
{"text":"For Chinese take-out this place is pretty good. I usually get the vegetable & tofu soup or beancurd home style. Both are satisfying and I eat there often."}
{"text":"love this place! the food is good, and the staff are some of the nicest people I have ever met. I just wish they had hibachi, if they did, it would be the only asian restaurant i'd go to."}
{"text":"Amazing Wok is a small takeout Chinese food place in Dormont on West Liberty, you could literally \"wok\" by it without noticing it as I did a number of times! I always observed the same woman and younger girl to be working there, the woman is a little high strung but I never waited longer than a couple minutes. To be honest the only thing I ever ordered here was the vegetable fried rice, and to the best of my memory a small was $1.85 and a large was $3.25. This place may have the best fried rice I've ever had! The rice is always moist, with peas and carrots and generous chunks of egg in it. If you are catching the T up the street, catching a bus home on West Lib or just in the area, stop in here and see what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"I frequent here for delivery often,most likely a few times a month at least. When you get delivery you're looking for no hassle and quickness. This place fits the bill. The phone service is great super friendly lady takes your order and always gets it right. The delivery times are fast and the food is very hot when it comes. The quality is very good as well and the price is reasonable. I've had the general shrimp and shrimp with mixed veggies which are both always good. I also get the crab Rangoon which is yummy. Definitely will be coming back...actually just ordered from them again!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food is hard to find. We were pleasantly surprised when we ate here for lunch one day. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great and you cannot beat the price. The crab Rangoon is honestly the best I've ever had anywhere. All their main dishes are also great. I love how their food isn't ridiculously greasy. I find that happens a lot with take out Chinese restaurants. Also a must try is the wonton soup, very tasty. Finally I always really enjoy ordering just because the lady who answers is so nice and friendly. This is my go to Chinese place."}
{"text":"In the Dormont area, Amazing Wok is the best for quick, affordable and tasty Chinese takeout/delivery. This is not a dine-in restaurant. The food has always been fresh and the service has always been exceptional. I've just about ordered everything off their menu and you can't go wrong with anything. They don't over salt and everything always tastes just right. I like ordering the combos because you also get a soup and egg roll, although the entrees aren't as large as when you order the entrees alone. If you're looking to dine in at home with good quality Chinese food (and you're in the Dormont area) and you need it fast, give Amazing Wok a call."}
{"text":"First time eating here. I had the chicken lo mein and crab Rangoon. Chicken lo mein had a great flavor. I really enjoyed it. The service was excellent. The lady I spoke to over the phone was very polite and nice, the  guy that delivered was the same way. So, thank you amazing wok, I will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"My husband LOVES this place. His favorite spot in charlotte. They offer a lot of gluten free food, not lo mein, but their sesame chicken. Very nice staff and very helpful."}
{"text":"Not impressed with my experience. The Hot and Sour soup was good, and the fried rice was okay. Also the portions were generous, but I'd rather have smaller portions of great food than a lot of crappy food. 

General Tsao's chicken had as much breading as meat and was not spicy, just had some peppers throw on top. The duck was the real disappointment. The veggies with it were okay but the duck tasted terrible. I love duck so I was very disappointed. I would not go back here. Ever."}
{"text":"We are newer to the Greentree area, so we were looking for a fast , delicious but inexpensive restaurant to grab dinner.

The restaurant was fast with our food! I think it took about 10 minutes to make out food which is ideal.

The food was very warm and packaged pretty well. My food was leaking onto the bag so that was frustrating. I ordered the General tso chicken and my boyfriend had the chicken and broccoli. We both ordered brown rice which you can not get at many places. We were overjoyed to find out they offer it.

The meals were decently priced for what we ordered. Overall, we will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Late night yum!

When I find a good spot that serves up yummy food that I can grab after working late then I'm all happy with only my pointer and pinky fingers extended...hand in the air!
I stopped at this joint on one of those type of nights figuring I'd give em a shot after driving by on so many occasions. 

From the outside it looks a lot like other take out Chinese spots...like they put no thought into design on the outside and threw up a few cheap embellishments on the inside, but really it's all about a delicious, piping hot good meal here. 

We ordered the chicken lo mein, which was busting out of the square plastic container.  First bite revealed warm noodles with just the right amount of bite...like a good pasta should, full of flavor with the usual zig zag cut carrots, snow peas, sprouts, mushroom, onions and the starring protein this time, chicken. We also ordered the Land and Sea entree which is a spicy mix of vegetables, chicken and shrimp. My tastebuds sang a happy melody. Yes, I heard it!

The service was friendly and fast. Look, it wasn't a Sesame Inn type of meal but it wasn't supposed to be.  It was just yummy. My only complaint was the sauce on my entree was watery. I'm used to the thick, rich brown sauce on my entrees from Chinese restaurants but honestly...if that's the only complaint, I'm gonna be back to visit and try more."}
{"text":"We've been eating here since we moved here from Los Angeles, 2004. Best Chinese food ever, and wonderful Owner who treat us like family!"}
{"text":"Simple casual Chinese restaurant. Service is excellent and the food is very good too. They seem to do a lot of take out but they also have a small, clean and modern dining room. Been here a couple times and the experience is consistent."}
{"text":"Amazing Wok has been our favorite Chinese restaurant for years. Their food is consistently good (although we did notice when they changed chefs) and they get our order right every time. They are friendly and offer efficient service when dining in. We have moved further away and still drive out of our way to get Amazing Wok."}
{"text":"I ordered the amazing chicken dinner, side of fried rice and an egg roll for delivery. The employee who answered the phone was extremely friendly and efficient, the delivery was at my door in about 20 minutes, and the food was awesome! The portion of chicken was huge, and way better than sesame inns amazing chicken, for less money. I will definitely be orbering from here again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. I have been coming here for about 6 years now, and they have never disappointed me once. The employees are very nice and hospitable, and they work hard and produce good service. The food is very good for the price and you get what you pay for. Some Chinese restaurants' lo mein is bland and overcooked, but amazing woks is so flavorful with a subtle garlic taste and I get it everytime. Their beef and broccoli is also amazing and much much better than many other restaurants in the area. Their lunch specials are also really convenient and a lot of food for a great price. I recommend this place to everyone and they have all been satisfied as well."}
{"text":"nice interior. greeted by actual asian waitress. she was nice, it would of been better if she knew the specials off hand. i order the mongolian beef and she tells me there's no vegetables added to the dish, just green onion. She wasn't kidding! the whole bunch of green onion was chopped and overpowered the meet. also, the hispanic working in the back saw my hispanic husband had the waitress serve us tortillas with our meal. it was hilarious! i really have had better, but the staff was very kind and that makes up for the wateriness of the dishes. the rice was good and fluffy. the end."}
{"text":"I placed a pickup order for lunch and got Mongolian Chicken with no onion add Broccoli. I did the dinner potion because I didn't want rice. When I go back to the office the amount of scallions was a bit out of hand. Next time I will ask for no scallions. It was a bit pricy for half of the dish to be scallions."}
{"text":"The food was good for Chinese take out, but when ordering the tofu be aware that tofu soup is extra and vegetable egg roll is extra. Make sure you specify or you get a pork egg roll."}
{"text":"Reminds me of New York style Chinese food. Really good fried rice :) wonton soup is spot on :)"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the food at Amazing Wok. I'm pretty picky when it comes to Chinese food, but I would say Amazing Wok is one of the better Chinese restaurants I have eaten at and that's saying a lot. I've driven by Amazing Wok probably a hundred times and I was always a little leery to eat there because it looks pretty run down from the outside and in the window. But I'm so glad I finally tried their food. 
Their prices are really good and the portions of food are huge. My meal lasted me 2 nights. The only downside is the menu is pretty small and there's just a couple vegetarian entree options. 
I'll definitely be ordering from Amazing Wok many more times in the future."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to place for delivery Chinese. The woman who answers the phone is so friendly and I love how they have your address stored with your phone number. The food is absolutely delcious and it's the fastest delivery I have ever experienced. They give you so much food for a reasonable price, you can easily get two meals out of one dinner. I'm just so sad that they're not open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Ordered Sesame chicken and it was way overcooked. Like it was sitting around and they recooked it. Half of the order was not edible and there was not very much meat on the pieces I did eat."}
{"text":"Love the food. Didn't realize I called and ordered from another store. They were patient with me and got all my 8 orders done. They food was worth it."}
{"text":"If youre looking for authentic Chinese food, look elsewhere.  Ordered Chicken with Eggplant.  At first I thought I received the wrong order.  The eggplant looked like fried tofu, but then I realized they breaded the eggplant like they were trying to hide the vegetable!?  So disappointed.  It wasn't even good at all.   It was a carryout order and they didn't even provide utensils."}
{"text":"So I find myself in a very unique situation since I moved to Beechview.  While I like the neighborhood, restaurants are scarce, and delivery options are limited even further.  So after months of trial and error, I can tell you, without a doubt, Amazing Wok is the best game in town.

I've never stepped foot inside the establishment, but seriously, who eats takeout-grade chinese food in the restaurant itself?  No one, that's who.  So I'm basing this entire review off of the delivery.

First, the service.  You're greeted on the phone by an incredibly upbeat lady, who I assume works every waking moment of her life.  She doesn't seem like she has a great grasp on the language, but she's super friendly.

Next, the menu.  It's everything chinese takeout should be.  Cheap, decent, and forgiving on your insides.  Actually the food is pretty good, I usually order the chicken and garlic sauce lunch special, which comes to a whopping six dollars.  The chicken is cooked perfectly, the sauce is awesome, and you get rice and soup...awesome.

The best part is, is how long it takes to get to you.  I call, place an order, and in about the time it takes me to drive to where the restaurant is at, they're knocking on the door.  Are they just guessing what people are going to order?  It's not just amazing...it's scientifically fascinating."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Chinese food in the town!! All I ordered are pretty good. I really appreciate they have difference styles of Chinese food. Definitely I will come back soon!!!"}
{"text":"For a Chinese takeout it's not bad. Regardless of what you order the food is typically consistent. Quick service and food is super hot. Lost of stars because last time we ordered my brother and I suffered from food poisoning"}
{"text":"Ordered the general chicken and the crispy shrimp along with the crab rangoons and hot and sour soup. The shrimp was soggy and over cooked. The general chicken was made from dark meat. Overall, not impressed. Especially for the $40 tab. They do not deliver, but when I went to pick up, the dining room looked clean.

Visited October 2013"}
{"text":"The food wasn't what we were expecting, but still tasted great. The general tso's could've used a bit more sauce and the pepper chicken wasn't peppery enough for my personal taste, but it's a ton of food for the price you pay! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Mmmm. LOoove me some Amazing Wok. The dumplings are supergood as is the General Tso's and egg drop soup, and they deliver to us! And fast too! Yummm-o. It may be our new Chinese go-to."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the best Chinese food take-out spots I've ordered from in a long time. Decent portions & prices and tastes great (I didn't even have to add soy sauce on their fried rice)!  Good customer service to me so far (I've ordered from here twice).  Delivery time was about 30min on a weeknight which I thought was pretty decent.  Amazing Wok does not disappoint."}
{"text":"I live a few blocks away, and always go to Amazing Wok.  I used to love Sesame Inn, until I discovered this little place.  The chicken is all white meat, which is huge in my book.  They will customize it for you as well (I don't like mine really spicy) and are always so friendly.  The woman who runs the place is so nice, every time I walk in we talk for a few minutes and she always remembers me when I walk in the door (I go maybe once a month).

I really recommend checking this place out. The food is great and cheap compared to competitors."}
{"text":"Late night Christmas meal! I'm glad they are still open on Christmas night and this is awesome! I got the beef with garlic sauce and black pepper chicken. The beef is garlic sauce is the best! The flavor is just right and little spicy kicker. I put some hot sauce on top of it, and I just love the spicy and sweet flavor of the beef! Highly recommend people to try them out!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here many times since it's been open.  We used to live right across the street.  We have dined in and taken out.  Their prices are a bit high and generally the food is ok.  

We have had a few instances where we ordered a dish one time and it was fixed a certain way and the next time it was different.  For the most part the service is decent, there is one lady there who very unhospitable, and argumentative when something is wrong.  The owner who seems to be there a lot is very nice.  I never understood why their prices for tofu substitutions for normal meat type dishes are priced higher than the meat dishes.

In Summation, the food is what you'd expect for chinese take out.  The value is decent.  I like Wan Fu, but it's a bit of a drive where we are now."}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken Lo mein, ended up getting what they called \"chicken chow mein\" which didnt even have crispy noodles like chow mein is supposed to.  They said they don't use crispy noodles, and included a bag of what amounted to basically flat croutons and said that was what they used for crispy noodles.  When I told them I didnt want what they had given me, they kept deflecting and telling me I ordered chow mein, and trying to convince me how good it is.  Refused to send me the lo meom I had ordered, and hung up on me.  I tried to eat it, but the sauce was basically liquefied garlic and ruined any chance of eating it.  I ended up having to throw it away, do not recommend."}
{"text":"My mother and I have gone here regularly for years.  The service is nice, take out is convenient and the food has never disappointed us. This is a solid Chinese restaurant with comfortable, cozy seating in a small single room if you want to dine in too."}
{"text":"Delicious food, stellar price, speedy delivery, and the woman who answers the phones is perfect."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! I have only gotten delivery, but every time they are timely and the food is piping hot!
Recently, my BF and I have been watching our diets a little closer, and Amazing Wok still allows us to indulge in Chinese takeout without being unhealthy. What do I mean? I mean they have a diet menu. There is a section of different combinations (My favorite is the shrimp with mixed veggies) and then you can choose to either have it steamed with sauce on the side or have it stir fried in a lighter sauce! HEAVEN! We have ordered from this part of the menu several times and have never been disappointed.  You can also get brown rice, which is a big win in my book. I have splurged and enjoyed their steamed dumplings, egg rolls, and crab rangoon. All delicious.

Customer service has been excellent every time I have called, and they always read my order back to ensure that they have everything right.  

Can not sing enough praised of Amazing Wok! If you're in their delivery area definitely give them a try! :)"}
{"text":"This was really good delivery Chinese! It got to our house very fast and the combo meals had a ton of food. It also didn't break the bank. We just moved from the East End and I'm having a ton of luck with Dormont/Brookline restaurants. Definitely true if Amazing Wok. I had garlic chicken (and there was a lot of chicken AND veggies, not just filler stuff) and my husband got Hunan beef, another winner. Menu is to the point, definitely a new go-to for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food for a takeout only local spot. They don't touch sesame inn but I haven't had a bad meal here yet"}
{"text":"One of the few places I miss in Pittsburgh ! The portions are generous, the prices are right, and the service is outstanding ! My favorites were the General Tso's, the Amazing chicken and the orange chicken !  All are spicy, but not over the top, heat for heat's sake, but a flavorful heat ! Totally worth the trip to Dormont"}
{"text":"Amazing is the right word.  Amazing customer service and amazing food.  the best is the Amazing Chicken.  Splurge and add the lo mein for a small fee, so worth it!"}
{"text":"We occasionally get take out with my parents when we're in town and they always get take out themselves.  Food is always consistently good.  Very friendly service.  Every time I call I am politely asked to hold because they're already taking an order and the phone is ringing while I'm ordering.  A great sign that you're going to a good place - busy, busy, busy."}
{"text":"Meh, food is oversalted, quality is questionable, and portions not such a value. Coming from NYC this place would last a week .. We frequent Redbowl , and now I remember  why Redbowl is better all around! We had sweet and sour chicken, beef w broccoli and wonton soup! the soup tasted like salty dishwater. Will not be going back this life!"}
{"text":"Killed it again, Amazing Wok! Food is always consistent, fast, & delish. Price point is decent, employees friendly."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time/money/calories. Chinese/Japanese is my favorite food and this is probably one of the worst meals I've had. I ordered it to go and when I got home, I threw it away after three bites. I can't recommend this place. Drive a few more minutes down the road and go to Great Wall of China. Puts this place to shame."}
{"text":"Love this place. The woman who works here is such a sweetheart and accommodating. They have healthy options which are few and far between at most Chinese restaurants. 

Can't recommend them enough. Food tastes great!"}
{"text":"Crab Rangoon is so good! Food is good. Don't think I've ever waited longer than 15 minutes to get my food. The lady that takes the orders on the phone is always very nice."}
{"text":"Amazing consistent food on your door step in 15 minutes or less. They have been the short schedule dinner saver on many occasions. It's not five-star food but it's pretty good"}
{"text":"Amazing Wok seems to be catching up with technology if the receipt from our delivered Chinese meal last night was evident of anything. 

I'm going to knock off a star for the flavorless beef fried rice I probably should have avoided, but the potstickers I wrote of before are still asskickers (I put in a double order for Kay and I), and the General Tso's Chicken (we wanted to play it safe since we were simply starving) has that moist, honeyed, crackling quality that makes the dish such an easy crowd-pleaser. 

Ordering over the phone with a credit card was a cinch, and the delivery was speedy.

Amazing Wok is almost amazing.

{"text":"I've been to Amazing Wok for lunch a few times now, and everytime that I have been the food has been great.  The lunch prices are $5 and includes rice with an egg or spring roll.  I usually get the regular Sweet & Sour Chicken.  The portions that they give you are pretty generous and the food always seem fresh."}
{"text":"My family and I love Amazing Wok. It is fast, taste great, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Ate here with my family for Christmas dinner, the wait was immense and the crowd was huge.  The prices were kind of high, but it was the only place open.. so we stuck around.

My daughter ordered the House Special (shrimp, pork, chicken) lo mein, which she really liked.  My partner ordered some kind of beef and onion pancake thing which looked like beef fajitas and tortillas- she really liked it. I ordered tofu and mixed vegetables, which was okay.

I would return for lunch specials, especially since it's close to my job."}
{"text":"Been eating their food, take-out, for about eight years. Consistently quite good, fast, and reliable. Have never made a mistake on my order. Large and hot! dinner portions come with choice of steamed, brown, or fried rice.  Broccoli in garlic sauce is a favorite - never mushy! 
Kitchen is in full view of the take-out counter. 
Ambiance is red, pretty neat, especially at night. 
Staff always courteous. 
Price is right. 
Perfect Chinese take-out for just me or my family of four."}
{"text":"Ordered a late night dinner for delivery. I ordered chicken lo mein, general gso chicken, & white rice. The lo mein was very good. The general gso's was not so good, the flavor was not very good & it's like they barely cut up the chicken they just left it in big chunks. I also ordered crab Rangoon, which I'm used to coming a dipping sauce. They didn't give me any sauce so I called & told them, they said \"you have to pay extra for that.\" I was surprised since it normally automatically comes with it at other restaurants I've been to. The lady got rude after that & told me that I should eat somewhere else then."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been great. I love that they have healthier options, like brown rice, no MSG sauce on the side and stir fry. Of course the regular not healthy options are yum too, and they deliver!"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT place to go. Owned by husband and wife. Incredible people. Sweet and sour fish... A must try!!! Coming back again"}
{"text":"We get delivery at least once a month.  Always been pleased with portion size and taste.   They are honest in how long it will take to get delivered.    No place to sit at business only pickup or delivery"}
{"text":"This used to be my go to. But now it's way too expensive for greasy Chinese food.  The customerservice is really bad. Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm new to the area and ordered delivery- it arrived sooner than expected with friendly service. I will be ordering again from this place in the future :-)"}
{"text":"One of our favorite local Chinese restaurants !   Also - the owner is great and really seems to appreciate our business.  Give them a try if you're in the mood for Chinese  !"}
{"text":"it's alright; not all of the offered dishes/meals are equally good but they usually try."}
{"text":"We decided to come here on a whim on the way to Wal-Mart one night. I ordered Kung Pao chicken and my husband ordered the Sweet n Sour. The Kung Pao chicken was way too salty. I took like 10 bites of my overpriced meal and called it quits. The sweet n sour was good but nothing special. I can't believe I paid $22 for that. Soooo salty. I would go to Firehouse if I could have a do over."}
