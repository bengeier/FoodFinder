{"text":"In LV for the weekend. Super crowded  due to a St Patrick's Day and a variety of events. So we wanted to stay away from strip. This restaurant  was great! Newly re-opened from another site. The food was excellent! The staff very friendly. Highly recommend. And be sure to visit the \"Christmas Room\"."}
{"text":"Their lunch menu is great, they have lots of options and all are delicious. I recommend the stuffed pizza with some garlic knots. Extremely tastey and affordable!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem is my favourite local spot to eat.  Sabotino and Luis are warm and gracious hosts and great storytellers.  Come in and introduce yourself if you're local and don't miss out on the garlic knots."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and breadnots. A great place to go with family and a nice place for parties too. What other place has tv's at the table? They have a gorgeous room full of Christmas docorations right now..a must see, I was in shock to see how much work and love they put in doing this. Take your family folks! The owner and workers are soo nice too!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab some good pizza and authentic Italian food!  Very kid friendly (they even get to make their own pizza!) and the food is amazing. We drive 30mins to have their garlic knots. Great place, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We are here on vacation and found this little hidden gem!  Walked in and the older, Italian man greeted us and handed us some menus. I thought this looks pretty authentic. We ordered 3 pizzas and we also got a free garlic knot while we waited. One taste of that garlic knot and we had to order 1 dozen.  The pizzas were super good. Thin crust, fresh toppings. Highly recommend the buffalo chicken pizza!  It's like eating a wing!  Super friendly service and quick!  I hope more people find and try this place!"}
{"text":"The Pizza is Very Good... Very authentic flavor not Americanized.The restaurant it self was a bit warm inside with the ovens running.but bearable near an open door.The neighborhood is kind of scary .but all in all a good experience ."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've had in a long time. employee is super nice and friendly. They also serve gelato."}
{"text":"Just hopped in here on a whim before heading over to the Westgate to watch the NCAA Tournament.  Pizza was excellent.  Not quite NJ/NY good, but still very good.  Customer service was excellent.  While we were waiting for our food, they brought use each a complimentary garlic knot.  Then, after we finished our meal, they brought us each a free canoli.  Very impressed!"}
{"text":"WHY is their food so good?! And the owner, Sabatino, is super nice, too. We order from here a couple of times a month, at least and have eaten in a few times with friends. The stromboli is HUGE and so flavorful. My husband is a vegetarian but also allergic to spinach so they're nice enough to sub out the spinach for broccoli for him.  My favorite (I admit my taste in pizza is boring) is the pepperoni and I've also had the pepperoni calzone. Oh, and the penne vodka is seriously good as well. I admit I like the one I make a little better but when I don't feel lime making it, theirs is a perfect sub in.  Don't be put off by the \"eclectic mix\" of businesses in the area. Just try this place, meet the awesome owner and enjoy their food. Trust me."}
{"text":"Thin crust at its finest. Great taste.  Great location Just discovered this awesome food experience."}
{"text":"Pizza is better than the pasta but I think it's too pricey.  Especially where it's located. Mozzarella sticks were just the basic frozen stuff. Thought they would have made their own with such a large Italian menu. Worth a try..4 stars for pizza"}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant makes delicious food, and is so much fun (especially for kids)! Make sure you try their Stromboli - which is light, fluffy, crispy, and flavorful: the dough to filling ratio is perfect. Their marinara sauce is packed with flavor - I dreamt about it after I left the restaurant. Moreover, the staff are friendly and welcoming, and they have a lovely room off to the side filled with moving Christmas decorations which will distract kids while parents relax and enjoy their meal. A very fun, charming, and delicious place for a meal..."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Westgate, and didn't want to deal with the traffic over in the strip. So glad we found Italian Oasis! We were greeted warmly and welcomed to sit down even though it was almost closing time. We had rigatoni, cheese pizza, BBQ chicken pizza, pepperoni and bacon pizza, garlic bread and garlic knots.  Every single item tasted great! Home style, handcrafted food, not at all like the chains. This is definitely somewhere we will visit again."}
{"text":"Upgrading to 4 stars because we actually enjoyed the leftovers and some of the other slices had a bit more flavor.  So feeling better about this place.  Would probably give it another try.    ----------------- OLDER REVIEW:  We ordered two pizzas.  I wouldn't get either one again.  One was a deep-dish cheese pizza.  It was flavorless.  I can't remember the last time I had pizza that didn't really taste like anything.  Once in awhile I would taste a tiny bit of flavor (where there was a very small amount of seasoning).  I lifted up the melted cheese and didn't really see any sauce except for on one or two slices.  For me, the sauce is 75% of the pizza.  Pizza #1 just tasted like hot dough.  But. hey, at least it wasn't burned or undercooked!  The other pizza had a super thick cream-like substance that just completely coated the entire pizza.  We thought it looked kind of unappetizing. I've never had a \"white pizza\" like this before.   It didn't taste gross, but we felt that it was too rich.  However, at least the pizza had flavor!   We aren't going to finish the cheese pizza (no point in ingesting all those calories if we aren't tasting anything), but we'll finish this one.  But only one slice at a time.    Ending on a more positive note... the delivery guy was friendly and the order came in a reasonable amount of time.  So that's good.  Other people seem to like this place, so perhaps you will, too!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Large Boston pizza special. Delivered to my hotel quickly, total $24. Better than $13 pizza slice at the casino on the strip. Boston pizza special was delicious, i would order from them again"}
{"text":"Great food with excellent service.   The garlic knots are especially delicious. Definitely worth the short drive away from the strip."}
{"text":"Freakin sucks this place closed! I thought it was the best pizza joint in town. I'm guessing the location has a lot to do with it. Good luck Luigi, hope you find success if you decide to open another restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and delicious. Nice and welcome environment with lovely Christmas decorations. Service also the best!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!  We had the Magahritta and House special.  I highly recommend this place to anyone in or visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Found this Italian place on yelps reviews, was gonna go to Magianos but really was dressed for it but really wanted some Linguini and clams. So I thought I would try this place out, it was a little hard to find its in the back off the main drag. It was very quiet and I thought that was odd for a Friday night but it was late around 9pm. I went ahead and looked at the menu  and ordered the Linguini and clams and noticed the garlic knots on a big plate and asked if I could try some and man they were good. The dinner came and one of the owners brought it out to me, he was very friendly and knoledgeable about the restaurant and food they prepare.  Oh you have to check out the Christmas room(in May) I guess its so neat they don't want to take it down yet. I'll be back. Ciao"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Sweet owners! I wish we lived closer,  we would come here more often. Ordered the spinach pizza and hot wings,  both very good. True Italian food."}
{"text":"We ordered tonight through GrubHub. We ordered a pizza which was supposed to be half cheese, half veggie. When it came, both halves were veggie and not the ones we ordered. GrubHub called them, and they refused to bring out another, so it was refunded. We tried to eat it anyhow, but it was GROSS!! Crust was burned and tough, and sauce and veggies were half cooked and flavorless! Garlic knots tasted like something out of a bag, and my husband ordered a Philly Cheese Steak and wasn't too impressed. We will NEVER order from this place again!"}
{"text":"A hidden little gem. Came in for lunch and we received a free sample of garlic knots..delicious. The pizza crust was nice and crisp with fresh toppings. You also must see the Christmas Village display that is up all year."}
{"text":"Just stopped by.  Wow!  Cool place.  Try the Italian sub!!  Garlic knots are awesome.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"We are from Wisconsin and for us there are not a lot of good pizza restaurants in Las Vegas. This place amazed us. We had the thin crust house special and it was outstanding! The crust was perfect, thin and crisp. You get to choose 6 toppings, and it was delicious. I want to go back to try the deep dish, because I bet it will be as good as the pizza we drive to Chicago to get. The place is a little hard to find, but well worth the trip. Our Greek salad was great. The Christmas lights provide a festive atmosphere. Wish they stayed open later than 10:00 PM, because it would be the perfect place to end any night spent on the strip."}
{"text":"This restaurant is clearly a labor of love. The pizzas, wings and mozzarella sticks we got were all delicious. The owners are very friendly and care about their customers. Don't miss the Christmas display!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome food and even better customer service. I had the Philly Cheese Steak and it was without a doubt the best one I've ever had."}
{"text":"I came in for some gelato while my friends got beers. While we were sitting and hanging out the owner came out and gave us complimentary FRESH OUT THE OVEN garlic knots!   I can't speak towards the rest of the food (yet), but if this is the kind of service I get just from ordering a gelato then I can't wait to come back for a meal! Top notch!   P.S. the gelato was amazing"}
{"text":"This is the cutest place!   Food was great.  Regular crust pizza and thick crust.  Both were extra cheesy and delicious.  The owner came and talked to us and showed us all the Christmas decorations.  Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Pizza was good... not sure if GREAT.  New place, clean... no beer/wine license yet. We were told \"in the works\"....  In a \"Hodge-podge strip mall location.  Visiting downtown Vegas for the weekend.  Owners very nice."}
{"text":"Although in a questionable location, the inside appeared clean and open. The dining area was darker and I didn't go in that side. I was greeted upon entering by Juan. Both men in the kitchen were friendly. I ordered to go and was brought a warm garlic knot while I waited; it was delicious. I took my meal home, the price was just over $30 for a 10\" pizza with about 4 toppings, and 10 chicken wings. The wings were ok, not great, but I don't care for breaded chicken wings - they get soggy. The pizza looked great but had no flavor aside from the anchovies. The crust was as bland as eating a pizza box. The dinner didn't sit well in my stomach. Sadly, as nice as the owner was, I can't recommend the food. The gelato looked good but I didn't try it. Great service- not great food."}
{"text":"We were also visiting from out of town and decided to stop in based on the high reviews. The location is a little off of the street in a strip mall but a good sized restaurant. We shared a pizza and a plate of spaghetti with meatballs and sausage. I would highly recommend both. Everything is made daily and the dough is also homemade. The pizza crust was thin and crispy. Both my husband and myself agreed the meatballs were some of the best we have ever had. It is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This restaurant which we loved for their white spinach pizza, fabulous garlic bread, and excellent flexible cooking is GONE. Lock Stock and Barrel! No change of location on the door. Nada. Would love to hear anything other Yelpers know."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving pizza and this place wasn't too far from our hotel, so we took an Uber here and it was probably one of the best decisions we made on our trip! The man working in the front was so friendly and welcoming. I ordered a Stromboli with pepperoni, sausage (and cheese of course). It was HUGE but I was so hungry I finished the whole thing (oops). No regrets here. The man convinced my friend and I to try some gelato, which we were planning to anyway haha. After sampling a few flavors, I decided on the Spumoni which was delicious! This gluttonous experience was definitely one for the books and I would definitely visit this place again the next time I go to Vegas.  Don't forget to check in for a free garlic knot! It was so fresh & mouth watering *drool*"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! Food was absolutely delicious and service was great! There is also a really cool Italian music machine that plays Italian songs, bring a dollar so you can play it! Highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I knew it!   Been driving past this place on our way to roller hockey. I kept telling people, \"this place looks like it's from Long Island NY\"!  Boom! Truth be told, they're roots are from Long Island - it brought me back home to memories.   Even better, THE FOOD! I am convinced, this is great NY PIZZA - the cheese, the cheese!! No melting or sliding off. This is the real deal.   The garlic knots, way way way better than your typical knots. Light, fluffy, airy dough. Awesomeness!!   I will definitely try the dinner there.   Please, show some love and get down to Italian Oasis!   Look for a man named Sabatino (hope I spelled it right) this man is a legend.   Good Pizza in Las Vegas - PROBLEM SOLVED - ITALIAN OASIS!"}
{"text":"Total sleeper, this place is da bomb! Xlnt deep dish and New York pizza! Don't forget the garlic knots, they are wowzer! Enjoy"}
{"text":"This is my go to family Italian place. Scratch made NYC style made with love. Not too spendy, good food at an honest price."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new pizza place to have dinner and came across Oasis Pizzeria.  What a gem!!!!  They are new to Commercial Center.  You much go eat there.  The pizza was amazing.  The owners are Italian and their food is so authentic."}
{"text":"This place is just north of the strip, super close. I ate lunch there and ordered the personal size pizza. The lunch portion only includes cheese, so they charge you for toppings. Overall, the pizza was good! Probably not my favorite pizza in the whole world, but definitely good. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.   I also ordered the mozzarella sticks. Also pretty good, but not the best I've ever had. I believe they were frozen, rather than home made, but none-the-less, still decent. Full disclosure: thenorder comes with six. My picture was taken after I ate one   I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous place  Great food super friendly staff but the best is that they make mini pizzas also as deep dish and don't leave without trying the garlic knots they are the best ever"}
{"text":"This place is right behind a local bar I frequent. I've heard nothing but good things about this place so finally walked over to give it a try.       Upon checking in on yelp I was given a free garlic knot.....which was very tasty. The place is very clean, smells nice, and the mozzarella sticks were tasty and the red tomato dipping sauce had more flavor to it then most other places. Staff were kind and informative. Thank you guys and I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery a while back and wasn't up to my expectations. Pizza was small for the price and wings were ok. Wanted to like it more but not for what we paid that day. Will be ordering bigger pizza next time as I don't think they have a solid pizza and wings/fingers deal."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. Me and my boyfriend stopped in here to pick up some food for our ride back home to California and the costumer service is far beyond expected. Staff is friendly and offered us free samples. The staff made us feel welcomed. The place is very clean with a great atmosphere. The food was super delicious as well. Love this place"}
{"text":"Definitely a place worth coming too! It's not in the best of locations but the food and atmosphere is worth it! Pizza is over the top here and what really is special about this place is the customer service. I was being catered to without expecting anything. Very friendly staff. Overall 5/5"}
{"text":"I've never written a review on yelp before but this restaurant impressed me so much I had to! The food is authentic and delicious, the restaurant is to die for, and the owner is a sweet, adorable, Italian man. The experience is almost as good as the food! I wish there was more restaurants like this. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time here, saw it on The way to eat tai food.  Checked out the reviews on Yelp and decoded to try it, I had been craving pasta for awhile anyway,  ordered the calamari and some garlic knots, very tasty. For my meal, ordered the pasta (Fettuccini)  with meat meatballs, the gravy was not overly seasoned and the meat balls were plenty and also very tasty. Dined i. On a Monday during lunch so no waiting. Will be back for sure to try more of the menu, maybe the pizza. I do recommend this place. Sorry no photos, started eating and forgot to take photo, didn't want to show partial eaten food."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town. I chose this restaurant because of the great reviews and, they are \"spot on\"! We had a fantastic dinner with a Greek salad, and a Stromboli. What made it even better was the authentic layout of the restaurant and the friendly staff! The owners come out and visit with you as you enjoy the meal.  If you are a sucker for Christmas decorations, one third of the restaurant is filled with a Christmas village! The food, the service, and the atmosphere were all above and beyond what I expected. Five stars, no doubt!"}
{"text":"From the outside this place doesn't look like anything at all, it's in kind of a funky strip mall. Once you go inside even at the decor is not that great but once you order the food you will be very very surprised. We had the pizza a couple weeks ago and it wasn't to my liking but a lot of people really like it. But last night I had the linguini with White clam sauce and I was just blown away. It was so good, huge portion, super flavorful and the pasta tasted like it was homemade but I'm not sure that it is. Really really friendly people looks like a family organization so I'm always happy to support local business. And they have Coke products which is important to me if you read my reviews. Again kind of a weird do you know off the strip funky kind of place but if you have a car looking for straight up Italian and not a lot of pretense or even that nice a place then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and pizza was delish! Had a little section with cute Christmas decorations. Their garlic knots were good as well. We will be going back because of their friendly people."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall pizza joint. We stopped here for lunch, I had the cheese steak and my daughter had a cheese pizza. Both were very good and you cannot beat the price......both meals with a drink for under $20. Thanks to Yelpers for the spot on reviews."}
{"text":"Very impressive menu of good Italian food.  I loved the stuffed pizza lunch special for $8.99 which included a drink.  Service is good and New York style pizza is the best.  Order before you come pick up or have delivered if you don't like the Commercial Center.  Lots of room and plenty of parking make this good for anytime of day or night when it's open."}
{"text":"Legit pizza, I know because i'm from New York.  My standards are very high so 4 stars is really like 5+ stars on here!  Dough made from scratch.  Their standard cheese pizza is excellent and also tried their buffalo chicken pizza which was also excellent.  I hope more people discover this place."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is excellent full Italian menu open for lunch and dinner a great space for events I've been eating here for several months and it's one of my new favorite Hangouts I highly recommend Italian Oasis Pizzeria"}
{"text":"After a long day running through the basic tourist sites in Vegas, my mom and I were starving and decided on takeout pizza for a late dinner. Seeing that Italian Oasis Pizzeria had such great reviews on here, and they were open late, we gave it a try.  I did a phone order of their house pizza which allowed me to select up to six toppings. At the price it was at, and the large size it came as, it was so worth it. I also ordered the chicken wings and asked to have it half BBQ, and the other half hot. Both were your typical BBQ and hot flavored sauce, nothing special. But the chicken pieces were on the bigger side, and quite filling. It took us 15 min to drive there, and by the time we walked through the front door, our food was packaged up and ready to go. Overall, great food and excellent customer service.  P.S. Check in for the free bread!"}
