{"text":"Had a team lunch there, we were a group of 12 people. Good food. Staff is very courteous.  They have ample variety in sea food and in desserts. Overall a good place. May visit again."}
{"text":"My sister and I had lunch at this place yesterday.  So disappointing.  Not much variety.  The sushi was OK.  Most of the other food was cold!  The hot and sour soup had a smoky taste, yuk!  The dumplings in the wonton soup were very hard.  The only good thing on the dessert table was the tiramisu and fresh fruit.  Would not recommend this establishment to anyone and certainly would not return!  I had the runs this morning!"}
{"text":"I went here for my friend's birthday at dinner time.  It was 25$ per person after tax.  The food is godawful.  NOTHING was good.  From the mushy uncooked shrimp  to the stickey and low quality crab legs to all the low quality cuts of meat.  It was terrible.  Avoid this place at all costs, go to Mandarin instead.  It's the same price and the quality and food is much better.  once again DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Agree with other reviewers who've said this place has gone downhill. Prices are high and not worth what you get. Food and desserts are below par. Honestly it's just not the same as it used to be. I'd say spend the same money at Mandarin and it'll be way better."}
{"text":"Good location, ample parking, sub-par food, horrid service.  This Imperial Buffet is situated in a convenient location for my friends and I.  There is always enough parking and often directly in front of the restaurant.    The quality of the food can be improved upon, but the lobster bisque, crab leg clusters, and the prime rib (most of the time) are the redeeming factors that keep me coming back (especially the 2-4-1 coupons).  I usually hate messy foods that you have to fight with, but I've become a huge fan of the crab legs.  They are fresh and constantly refilled, so I highly recommend theses steamy, delicious crustaceans.  The lobster bisque is a great starter, but I would pick and carefully choose among the offerings at the salad bar.    There are too many fried dishes, so I usually choose among the steamed and stir-fry dishes.  The sushi bar is limited and the freshness is often suspect.  Skip the seaweed salad - its one clumpy mess.    For desserts, skip the ice cream, unless you like over-frozen bland quasi-ice cream. The sweets aren't too bad - similar to offerings from any chinese buffets. I prefer the fresh fruit, but they don't refill them often enough.    TBH, my friends and I usually go to the Imperial Buffet only when we have the  2 for 1 coupons.  The interior of the restaurant is not very inviting and the service staff can try to be friendly.  The dishes are cleared often enough but you tend to need to beg for more napkins as they only give you a couple of sheets at a time.  They don't even refill your drinks unless you successfully flag down one of the servers."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I've never wanted to leave a buffet so badly. The food is low-grade, cheap, and stale. Obviously no pride taken I the quality or preparation of the dishes. Just slapped together. The lobster bisque for example was very obviously canned cream of mushroom soup with some artificial crab mixed into it. It's this kind of lazy dishonesty you'll find throughout."}
{"text":"My family and I come here special occasions and we usually love the food. Great variety and everything is usually very tasty. Great food for a buffet and great price."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch mid week and it was quite busy.  Line up at door! The decor is nice compared to other Chinese buffets. The food was fresh and good.  Lots of variety and sushi bar. Lots of desserts to choose from as well.  The staff was pleasant!  If using coupons, it's 1 per table and cash only!!"}
{"text":"Ensconced in a plaza at Dixie and Dundas, nestled between Value Village and Talize, Imperial Buffet has a slightly surreal exterior and looks incongruously new (alas, it was too dark to get a decent photo). The service was decent, but given that it was buffet, there wasn't much required of it.  Selection wasn't bad--it felt like there was a lot of desserts and fewer main courses than most buffets, but this might just have had to do with the floor plan, because when I think about it, there was actually quite a selection of dishes available.   There were the usual preparations--lots of rices, breaded and fried foods, breaded foods in sauce, and then old standards like beef in black bean and fish dishes. The veggies--broccolli, snow peas and mushrooms were tasty. A small assortment of passable sushi (nothing to boast about), including a few unusual preparations. The other meats were yum, though--roasted fish, lemon chicken, and beef in black bean were all tender and nicely prepared. I'd pass on the garlic and cheese oyster, however--mediocre and somewhat oily. There was also roast beef and mash potatoes, crab legs and pizza, though I didn't try any of those. Others seemed to be making short work of the crab legs, so I can only assume they were delicious for those who like such things.  Desserts were various, from fresh waffles and mango mousse to sesame balls and sugar pie (a regional Quebec specialty--the chain is widespread in Quebec as \"The Mandarin\")--among many others. The selection was wider than usual. There was also the usual salad, fruit and soups, including a pleasant enough crab and lobster bisque (though I didn't actually notice nor taste either the crab or the lobster, but the soup was still nice).   In all, pretty good for a buffet place. I'm not the biggest fan of the buffet (AYCE, fresh, made to order sushi is another story, though). In general, I feel as though the buffet's main virtue is that you can try a variety of foods, rather than committing to one dish for a meal--but otherwise, I find the food is often a little greasier than need be, in order to keep things from drying out.   Still, if you like buffets, this one is worth checking out--as buffets go, it's a good one! Not the best ever, but definitely decent!  Tips:   Apparently, it's free on your birthday (small print is that there has to be at least two other people accompanying the birthday person, I believe).   BUT, for that, and for any coupons or specials, you have to pay cash. They don't have Interac--just an independent, service-charging bank machine in their foyer that conjures visions of interac fraud and bank card theft. I expect it's fine, given that it's in their foyer and a maitre d'/waiter is usually present, but still... Bring cash withdrawn from a trusted bank machine, to be safe. You can never be too careful."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to a lot of buffets, and this one is definitely one of our favourite! We always come here for someone's birthday or for a family gathering. Great selection for everyone, from seafood to meats to sushi to the salad bar. And the dessert options!! I couldn't get enough of the chocolate fountain, the wide variety of cakes, and the chocolate mousse. We will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"It's an OK Chinese buffet as it goes. The food areas are well stocked and accessible with fairly comfortable seating. There is a hot meat bar custom carved, a fair assortment of seafood (seasonal), and the staff are nice to deal with and attentive.   We've been several times because it's close and because the birthday person eats for free. (ID required).   Desserts are a good selection of fruits, cakes and other baked goods as well of 4 or 5 flavours of ice cream and a chocolate fountain.   The buffet meal rums about 22 bucks a head tax in without alcohol."}
{"text":"Good service, dinner price too high comparing to selection. Fish and shrimp are good; sushi not so much. Lots of desert but not so enough hot dishes.  For what they do have, the quality is good."}
{"text":"What a major disappointment!!! We went to this place (Dixie/Dundas location) for our sons birthday.  We were under the impression that this was a Chinese Buffet. Boy were we wrong. They had no chicken balls and no egg rolls (which are two of the main dishes everyone thinks of when thinking Chinese). The food that they did have was extremely substandard quality. The prime rib was beyond rare, more like raw, and their seafood tasted borderline edible.  This is a confusing place that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, I can't even call it a Mandarin copy as it would not be fair. If you want to eat here and want a Chinese food meal, call ahead and ask if it is China night."}
{"text":"Great food! Im on a low carb diet so I go for their clams, mussels, crab legs, roast beef, shrimp, olives and seasoned fish. I find the meal to be fulfilling. Their shrimp is devined and their mussels don't have even the slightest bit of seaweed in them. I also enjoy their escargot on regular days and their deserts are to die for! Way better than the wok or the sushi buffets. I was there half an hour ago."}
{"text":"I booked it for my birthday, but was only free if you have a party.  There were some good selection of sushi freshly cooked hot plates, and even salad and dessert station.  Quality was average and was overcharged in our bill with their miscalculation of our parties age range. I would not come back."}
{"text":"We came here for my mom's birthday.  It's good they have this birthday special, however, the food here is pretty hard to swallow.   There's some decent food like the shells, but the crab legs have weird taste. It wasn't cracked beforehand so it was difficult to open. The crab is overlooked, the meat is stuck in the shell and takes some big effort to take it out. There's a bunch of Chinese food court style foods, which is sitting under the heat lamp and taste pretty bad. Shrimp is not fresh and tastes soft/powdery. The chocolate fondue is too thin and can't harden on the strawberry.   The decor is old and mouldy. The service was okay at the beginning until the waiter won't come to fill our water or take years to bring up our bill.  At the end of the day, we paid $34/person WITH birthday special, you are competing in the price range of Mandarin while the atmosphere, service, food quality and selection is on par with a third world country. Never coming again."}
{"text":"Great variety of dishes. Place looks clean with nice ambiance. Even better value when used bogo coupon. I'm Chinese and this place is definitely one I frequent a lot."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but my main problem is they do NOT take debit. I found this out only after I got the bill. Luckily my mom had her master card handy. They told me I could use this ATM that charged $3.50/ transaction. My attitude: No debit, no business. There are other places in town with much better food and service such as Mandarin and they all take debit."}
{"text":"It was the table beside us that stole food. Yet, my mom showed the owner her purse and her empty water bottle. Yet the owner falsely accused her of theft. They never apologize or offer us a discount on our meal"}
{"text":"Tried to make reservations for a large party and went in person. Initial hostess was very friendly but I was forced to deal with an old, rude, so called manager. There were 3 different prices displayed and the so called manager tried to convince me that 18.99 plus 2.75 for drinks was 22.74 to start... Good deal my ass! She then in turn told me prices are going up on August 31st so I'm getting a deal anyways. Don't know the relevance of that argument. Then I asked if the price was negotiable since I was organizing a party of 60 adults and 10 children and she disappeared for 7 minutes and when she returned she said \"why are you being so cheap?\" I questioned if she was the manager and how she could treat customers this poorly. I still needed a venue so I decided to book the venue and hoped that maybe she's not the manager on the day. She did end up writing some numbers on a sheet of paper for adult, seniors, children, and infants which did not coincide with the printouts so I asked how she's going to know about these special prices on the day of the party, she walked off, and said to the hostess in Chinese, \"this guy is annoying!\" I've now booked reservations at Mandarin. Better service, professional booking manager, and better deal!!!!!!!! BEWARE OF THE B*@$#!"}
{"text":"The selection is bad and the service is even worse. I often go there for family events (because for some reason they like this place), and I'm always waiting for more than 20 minutes for a drink. If you try to wave down the waiters and waitresses, they will walk right by you and not acknowledge you.  And they stopped serving chicken balls, what kind of a Chinese restaurant doesn't have chicken balls?"}
{"text":"Looking to impress a date or family maybe even entertain friends from out of town. Then don't come here it's a mixed array of frozen tv dinners that are separated and sorted then served at decent prices. The seating reminds me of the restaurant zellers use to have and the cliental well it's a mixed bag of odds and ends. So in closing if you don't have alot of money to spend and your hungry head on over you will get fed give it an hour and if you feel good you had great meal there."}
{"text":"this place is awful, yes, cheap, but food quality is terrible.  save up your money and go to mandarin if you want to have a buffet of chinese food. or better yet, just go order a meal at a restaurant, no buffet."}
{"text":"absolutely awful food. and this is with a buy-one-get-one free coupon. even for six bucks, this was terrible. awful flavour, awful texture, awful quality of ingredients. i expect less in service at a buffet, but our server didn't even show up to ask us if we wanted anything to drink until we were finished lunch (and no, it wasn't busy at all) do not recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible!!!  I'm not usually one to comment on places however for this one I feel I should. My boyfriend and I moved to sauga 7 months ago and we seen this place haven't made it there till tonight.   So we actually had a buy one get one free  as soon as we walked in the guy host said hello and I seen the sign \"if you have a coupon senior discount tell us before we seat you\" so we told him and bam insta rude... Suddenly no customer service skills.  Now the food. It was cold it was over cooked it was not better then mandarin by any means. I am really disappointed..we did not even finish our food.   I do not recommended this place to anyone.  PS gave it 1 star only because we had to give it something so I could post but I honestly give it no stars"}
{"text":"Friday lunch - $14.99  Fair price. Selection and presentation was decent. Unfortunately, they don't take DEBIT. WTF? Seriously? It's 2015. They directed me to the ATM in their lobby, which charges $1.50 transaction fee.  I would return only if they got debit payment."}
{"text":"Loved the fresh crepes. Was a bit disappointed there wasn't any salmon sashimi. There was smoked salmon though. There was a decent variety of food."}
{"text":"Food was hot but bbq pork was very fatty.  The desserts were hit and miss with the sugar free ice cream barely passing for ice milk and why on earth would you use grapes with seeds in the fruit salad.  The walls are splattered and look like they haven't been cleaned in years and even though the cleaner was going through the buffet area while we were having lunch with a mop, everywhere i stepped the  floor was sticky. Will unsubscribe from email list."}
{"text":"I eat at your restaurant many time. The food attendant middle aged woman server with a round pimple on the nose yell at coworker and steal food to stuff into her pocket when mangers not near by, I don't think she is that poor to be a theft employee. She is always nasty towards other workers so watch your wallets when she come by. Mean towards me when i ask question regarding coldness of the shrimp. One day soon be fired"}
{"text":"Zero star rating. WORST BUFFET EVER.  Everytime I started a plate I thought \"no worries, the next will be better\" only thing is that it wasn't.  Right down to the dessert (which looked amazing)....looks are deceiving! The food is cold and nothing tastes like its suppose to. The fish tastes like mushy butter, I couldn't bite into the bread, the beef was watered down.  No flavor to be found in this place whatsoever!?  I would prefer skipping a meal all together then to have to eat from this place again...."}
{"text":"I'm not picky when it comes to food and I don't usually complain about it but after my experience today at the Imperial I felt compelled to come on here let everyone know how awful this place is...  I've been to this buffet a couple of times in the past and had left there feeling like it was good enough to be one of the buffet options in the area...today was my birthday and my wife and I decided to go there for lunch, I don't know what happened to this place but the quality and taste of the food was horrific. Today.  First off there wasn't much of a selection and what was there looked and tasted old... Noodles were rubber ... The Rice were hard and burned... Meats were tasteless and hard to chew.... I tried a series of the dishes hoping to find something id enjoy....each dish worse then the next... at some point I realized it's best I don't need anything because I was worried about getting sick from the food.. so yes on my birthday I left a buffet hungry! After what I just witnessed I can't imagine this place staying open much longer.  Please please please take my advice if you want to go to a buffet drive the extra 20 minutes into Oshawa and go to anyone of the 4 buffets they have there...."}
{"text":"My family and I often go here when a birthday comes up because of they get a free meal, not to mention their above average selection of food. It's much better than the other buffet... I it doesn't hurt to say it, Mandarin LOL.  What to Expect -The atmosphere is a lot like Mandarin, somewhat relaxed and informal. -Staff there are attentive yet NOT annoying, unlike Mandarin where you're welcomed 8 times before being seated. -It's overwhelming seeing all the food, take a deep breath and eat slow to maximize your money.  What to Eat -They have the typical \"Chinese\" food like sweet and sour (insert name of meat here), lo mein noodles, fried rice and egg rolls that don't really contain eggs. -In addition they have unique stations like the sushi bar, carving station, crepe/waffle station and an awesome dessert section. -Sushi bar is sufficient, not the best sushi but not as bad as Mandarin where all their fish is cooked -.-' . They even have sashimi if you ask the sushi makers! -They typically have prime rib at the carving station, lamb skewers and grilled shrimp. Love the variety. -Dessert section has a waffle/crepe station (TIP ADD ICE CREAM TO IT!), on weekends they have a chocolate fountain.  -Also they have a great  seafood section, CRAB LEGS, OYSTERS AND SHRIMP!   All in all it is a great buffet compared to the other Chinese buffet (Mandarin)."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!.  I read the reviews. .all bad...Had to see for myself. . My god its so Nasty...all the food was old and dry..also Luke warm..NOT HOT.   The bathroom  was dirty..smelt like Urine. .  Leave a plate on the Tabel. .still there when I get back..3 plates later I had to ask someone  to remove  them.. only reason I had 3 plates..was trying  to find something  eat able. .I Didn't .. DO NOT WASTE $1 EATING THERE.... if they were giving  away free meals... I still  would  not go...  ABSOLUTLY  NASTY PLACE"}
{"text":"I find that the quality of food and selections have fallen off. Used to be good, lot of the food served are over cooked and rushed. Deep fried Crab Legs is dry, Grilled Squid and ribs are quite rubbery, fruits was not even ripe enough to eat. I also found a hair on my Sushi. I thought maybe it was my hair at first but when I pulled it, it was partially wrapped in the Sushi itself. Got grossed out! Eeeeeeeewwwwwwkkk!!!   I wonder they even have such thing as quality control on food they serve."}
{"text":"I agree with everything Bernie C. said, Imperial is basically Mandarin except with better food.  I like how they have King Crab Legs and other great seafood.  I'm not an avid chocolate eater so the chocolate fountain was no interest to me.  I like how they have a great variety in dessert pastries, but I usually stuff myself too much to enjoy dessert.  Service here is decent, but the staff all seem like they'd rather be somewhere else, and are always annoyed.  The front hostess begrudgingly asks you the give her the age of children first before pricing as they don't want you lying to them.  Prices are a little expensive.  I feel since Imperial isn't as busy as Mandarin, they are adequately cleaner.  Anyways, a great alternative to Mandarin, but there are much better places I'd rather dine at."}
{"text":"Wow !! Came here today at around 2:30. Looked around and asked if more food was coming .. The waiter said yes more food was coming out .while waiting I ate a drum stick and a peace of roast beef the rest I had to leave because the food was cold... After that mg wife and k decided to advice the manager that the food was cold and all the employees were having lunch and we weren't satisfied with the service .. The store manager stopped us on the way out and told us because we ate something we had to pay $10 or else we couldn't leave and to not come back again...  This people should not be in business , how dare them treat customers this way. Instead of trying to make up the loss of service they confront you at the door and try to charge you for two pieces of food .. TERRIBLE FOOD AND SERVICE!!!!"}
{"text":"Good lunch buffet for a cheap price,  no chicken balls??"}
{"text":"Good customer service. Staff was polite, made sure I got what I wanted. The food was good. There was decent choices in sushi. It would be good if they brought back the shrimp dumplings. Good selection of beverages. Good desserts. Good selection of different dishes."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to feel about this place. This was our first visit after hearing rave reviews and didn't really think it was all that amazing. People are comparing it to the Mandarin but saying its better and I don't really think so. I guess being able to get these specialty sort of items like crab legs all the time rather than just on weekends or a holiday is what impresses people, but the crab legs and other fancy sea food items we had last night were almost off tasting. The crab legs were over cooked and rubbery with little flavor, and the shrimp I got from the grill had definitely gone bad with a very strong fishy small that lingered on my hands even after washing them from peeling just one. Other then that we got our fill on the other items and it was ok but we definitely wont be returning anytime soon unless we're invited to go."}
{"text":"Too bad Zero stars is not an option on yelp.! Our party of 7 arrived for a birthday dinner celebration on a Saturday around 7pm and the food selection here on is absolute horrible (no oysters or scallops like as advertised). Most of the items were not replenished. The food was far from fresh. Food health and safety board should definitely take a look at this place. For $29 (before tax and tip a person) I really don't know what they're charging their customers for. The place closes at 9:30pm but they start packing away the food before 8pm. It was a very depressing place to dine. I will never return to this location nor recommend my worst enemy to dine here."}
{"text":"oh, yeah, the food is definitely crap, but what do you expect from a chinese buffet in a scarborough big-box mall? Filet Mingnon? No, the thing to do with a place like this is get SUPER DRUNK beforehand. It'll make it easier to overlook the cockroaches crawling around and the employees coughing on the food, and really, isn't the point of a chinese buffet is to fill up enough for the next week for under fifteen bucks? Going to a cheap, ghetto, Chinese buffet when you're incredibly hammered is a rite of passage for living in Scarborough. So yes, the food is probably really filthy and has likely been sitting there for hours... but... you can eat as much of it as you like! The waiter even let me and my friends go out, smoke a joint, and then come back fro round two. Nice place. Oh, and they serve Tsingtao beer and will never, ever, cut you off. Don't go sober. Like arun said, a chinese buffet, that's all. If you don't like cheap chinese buffets, you won't like this place."}
{"text":"The decor in imperial is not the greatest. It reminds me of sitting in a school or workplace cafeteria with the same sort of table and chairs. The colors and decor of the walls is very bland and not that welcoming.On the other hand I must say their food is DELICIOUS!!! I always like going for their sushi bar, it always tastes fresh everytime. They are great competitors with the Mandarin when it comes to the food. I like the deal they have buy one get one free for your birthday when you show your license. Alot of restaurants do not offer birthday deals anymore. I always look forward to receiving their coupons they have to offer for lunches and dinners in the mail :)"}
{"text":"It's a buffet, a buffet! What do people expect? quality & service of fine dining? Those that say the food sucks and hard to swallow. What do you eat everyday? Caviar, foie gras & turbot served by your butlers? Come on, the food here is not that disgusting. If you think everything here is a piece of crap then go back to eating at your snobby restaurants.   My review:   Decor crap OK. But who comes in a buffet and eats the decor? I'm staring at my gigantic plate of food most of the time so I could care less.   Food: good selection of food. There was more selection of food that I could eat which is a good thing and I try to take a little bit of everything skipping most of the carb/starch foods. There are plenty of meat dishes & seafood. Crab legs, tones of shrimp, calamari, raw oysters, scallops, smoked salmon, those snail thingies, clams, muscles. Then you got good amounts of land protein: ribs, roast beef, roast duck, crispy pork and a load of other typical buffet meats. Just think of the hard turd you'll have the next day!   Price: this is why I give it 4 stars. It's damn cheap. No where in town you can eat so much for so little. Two people eating on weekend dinner for $34 or so (free meal on birthday) A steal! Absolute steal. With all the food you eat the place is probably making a loss on those deals. But me being a cheapskate most of the time, I'll only eat here on birthdays.   4 stars as far as buffets because of the value on birthdays weekends. The rest of time I won't bother coming 3stars for the rest."}
{"text":"SO much better than the Mandarin! The food is always fresh, hot and delicious. Their chicken balls are actual chicken with a thin layer of batter (as opposed to other places where it's all batter and barely any chicken).  The sushi rolls are fresh and always cold, so you don't have to worry about anything.  The desserts were great. The chocolate cake tasted like actual chocolate. It wasn't too sweet but it wasn't bland like other buffet places. Wasn't really a fan of the cream puffs though... The cream just tasted off... Maybe it was premade, like from a can. When I had a crepe, I added just a touch of the whipped cream and strawberry sauce and it worked out really well.  I didn't really have a problem with the decor. To be honest, if I'm going to a buffet place, decor doesn't really play a huge part in the overall experience, as long as its not dirty.  The staff was really helpful to all of the customers, although there were a couple times where I felt like they didn't really want to be there which I feel is not very professional.  Either way, everyone must go to this place. The food and desserts are yummy and you don't feel horrible about yourself after overeatting because nothing is overly heavy."}
{"text":"The best part about this buffet? The dessert. I'd come here just for the dessert.  I'd say the quality of food is similar to mandarin, the assortment is slightly different, but the dessert menu is superior to Mandarin for sure.  I don't remember everything they have for dessert (read some of the other reviews) but they had a variety of cheese cakes.  If you've ever purchased cheese cake, it is not cheap. Mandarin offers low quality cheap desserts in comparison.  They have a crepe stand.  On the weekend they have a chocolate fountain. A wide selection of ice cream, and other sweets.  They also have the best tempura sweet potatoes I've ever eaten, but they're only available at lunch time. At dinner, they have crab legs.  Regarding service, I don't think many of them understand English properly, they only know enough basic words.   But considering the value they provide over Mandarin I'm fine with that.  It's cash only if you're using a promotion/coupon, be aware of that."}
{"text":"Am kind of surprised by the bad reviews here but IDK, ymmv.  Also the Buffets in my area (like Starwalk) are pretty crappy so this was in comparison a lot better.  I'd give it a 3.5 tbh if I could, but rounded up since 3 seemed kind of low.  Food was decent, tasted pretty fresh imo. I particularly liked the Lobster Bisque. Service was good enough, the servers were friendly.  Atmosphere was nice, bathrooms were fairly clean/didn't smell weird at all.  I would recommend this buffet to people. :)"}
{"text":"Was here for a birthday.  Good selection.  Friendly staff.  Was looking for the crab legs but they only had the ones on ice.  After reading reviews I see they only come out on select days and unfortunately my dads bday didn't fall on that day.  The only flaw is maybe upkeep.  I like to see we'll take care of establishments even though hundreds of people flow through the place.  Another disappointment was not having a large enough stomach to try everything :)  will definitely have to return."}
{"text":"We came here because we got a 2 for  1  coupon in the mail.  When we came in we were told cash only and we had to buy a drink. The food was okay . Some of the meats where a bit dry.  Sushi was not bad fresh.  Lots of shrimp . Desert was great lot of cakes and fruits.  A bit pricy I think . If your not using a coupon.  They even have a soft ice cream machine and cones now that was cool ."}
{"text":"A friend and I came to this restaurant for a little get together. We searched for a buffet in our location that is reasonably priced but we were unfortunately incredibly unsatisfied, disapointed and underwhelmed. Do not come here for a late dinner from Monday and Friday 7 - 9 (closing) otherwise you'll be resorting to eat the left over food that has sat at the end of the day. They do not replenish the food during these hours so it's basically first come first serve and what's there is there. The food was mediocre (bland and commecialized), you can tell it has been sitting for quite awhile,  and did not provide much variety. However, the desert was okay. I personally believe for the quality and variety of the food, especially during those hours of operation should be discounted considering you do not get your money's worth. The total came up to $30 per person. You'd be better off going to a better high end buffet for the same cost or $5 extra like Dragon Pearl or Mongolian Grill. We will not be coming back and I do not reccomend."}
{"text":"This is a buffet so you can't expect top notch food, after all people go there for the quantity. I personally don't like buffets but it was my friends birthday so we went. A plus for anyone on their birthday, its free (when you have a friend with you)!  But for me I found it way to expensive especially for the lunch hours. My server was always smiling so naturally I liked my server. Everything was clean, excluding my glass of water which wasn't too clean. Overall it was an average experience, but I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Just as good as the Mandarin. They have everything you could possibly want in an all you can eat buffet."}
{"text":"Expensive place ($29.99 per adult), nothing fancy. Service is ok, staff are nice, clean up our plates fast. The place is clean, but the plates are dirty. Every time when I went to get a new plate, there are food and veggie sticked on it. I had to go thru 4 to 5 plates before I can find a clean one, quite disgusting."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a few years ago and I loved it. So when I brought my husband here, I told him it would be awesome, great food, lower price than Mandarin.... Wow was I wrong on multiple levels.  Price: This place was always cheaper than Mandarin and I liked that because I like Mandarin but found it pricey. Well now this place is about the same price. Literally. On Weekends more! not worth it.  Food: The food was mostly dry, tough and tasteless. A complete disappointment. I tried a bunch of different items hoping it was just a bad batch. Nope even the new batch that came out piping hot was the same.   Even the desserts were either really dry/hard or soggy.   The overall restaurant was a disappointment. Even from the picture provided you can see the food, and the décor. Even the utensil I was given was bent badly. The waiter didn't want to bring me a new fork!  You can be 100% sure I will never be coming back here or recommending it to anyone.  Till next time xoxo happy eats."}
{"text":"Umm...hard pass on this one.   I had read the reviews on this place prior to coming here, but didn't really have a choice but to go since it was to celebrate a birthday.   Crab legs have strangely mushy/unsnappable shells, and the meat inside is difficult to remove in one piece.  Fruit bar has a small selection of fruits, all of which were either unripe or dry.  Hot buffet foods are mostly the food-court style of fake Chinese food that's been sitting under heating lamps all day.  Saw a kid using the ice cream scooper water faucet to wash her hands (uh, ew).  Small selection of pretty much everything.    The cocktail shrimp are OK.  They have the sea whelk here which is nice, even on a weekday.  The cold mussels can be pretty large, but may be smushed by the ice it sits on.  On the upside, I thought the staff was fine - saw a more elderly man lifting a ton of fresh plates to set onto the buffet table; I know it's his job, but I still feel really bad for him.  I hope at least the staff are being paid & treated nicely..."}
{"text":"The only reason I go to Imperial Buffet is when I have that buy one get one free coupon on hand.  The food is really good! Not Mandarin quality, but better than other buffets.  I just load up here on their fresh waffles.  Service is also great too! Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"good selection but i found more than once olive pit in my food, showed it to the manager and they did not do anything about it.  gave them another chance and found hair and olive pit again, and again nothing was done regarding that.  will not come back again cuz hygienically this place is not the best of chinese buffets  and the manager was rude, she should be worried about us calling ministry of health  instead of the attitude"}
{"text":"We went because we had a coupon and had passed by this place many times.  We should of done some research. We walked in and gave the coupon and instantly the tone changed. We were then told cash only. We questioned this as the coupon did not say that.   Reasons for a 1 star are:  1) All my \"Hot\" food was cold, not warm.... COLD 2) The soft serve ice cream is out of a Margarita machine..... not exactly ice cream then..... 3) My partners cheese cake had sat out so long it was now multiple shades of colour. 4) My brownie was so stale it snapped in half. 5) I tried to get roast beef, if was too raw so I asked for well done. She threw it on a grill with tons of shrimp on it. The beef was touching the shrimp. I am deadly allergic to fish. I told her this and so she just moved it half an inch further away.  6) Not one employee smiled. 7) I now have food poisoning and this was the only place I ate today. 8) The chocolate fountain was not on. 9) Most of the meat was all fat and grissol  10) Items like chicken balls had almost no meat in it at all. 11) Spring rolls had almost nothing in them they were cold as well. 12) This place charges at regular price close to Mandarin prices. No where near as nice atmosphere, decor or quality.  I would avoid this place at all costs.  I hope a health inspector goes in soon."}
{"text":"Wow too bad this place has such low reviews? I had a wonderful experience here. Staff were extremely friendly and prompt and took plates away with impeccable timing, providing napkins and drink refills as soon as needed. I was really impressed with the selection of seafood! Seafood everything! Clams, mussels, oysters, clams, crab claws, surf clams, shrimp in every which way shape and for - baked, boiled, raw, salad. HUGE SELECTION!   Definitely got my monies worth and I'm a happy camper."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this restaurant yesterday and was quite disappointed. I like \"Spoonful by Imperial Buffet\" in Brampton; however the food and ambience at this location was inferior. Surprisingly, there was relatively little Chinese food available in this Chinese Buffet. I have had much better Chinese food elsewhere. There is a large dessert selection available for those with a craving for sugar.  My seniors buffet cost a reasonable $14.40. I also ordered a pot of tea. I was shocked when the bill arrived and I was charged $2.50 for the tea. Had I know that, I would have just had water.  The interior design of this restaurant is getting a bit old and dated. It is not as appealing as the design of their Brampton location."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be.  We came here on Chinese New Year to experience some not so Asian food.    I was surprised to see many dishes that were far from Asian such as; Spanikopita (frozen) and Pasta Alfredo which were passable at best.  Most people come for the crab legs,which were so salty that I couldn't even stomach a second bite.    The rest of the food was either cold or lacking any flavor.    If you are looking for an Asian buffet, you are most likely better off going to Mandarin.  On a weekend it cost about 80.00 for 2 people not including any alcoholic beverages, which could have gone a lot further anywhere else."}
{"text":"This place has terrible food, service and atmosphere. The variety offered is limited and the desserts were skimpy. Also, mixed drinks were watered down, not a good thing when you are paying big bucks. I suspect there was no alcohol in them at all. The mens washroom was flooding and by the time we left, our clothes were stinking of fish?! Totally unimpressed with Imperial."}
{"text":"Solid Asian buffet with standard dishes that taste decent enough to warrant coming back once in a while but not often. I like to think of it as a cheaper Mandarin, especially if you use the BOGO coupon they send you in the mail. It works out to around $11/person, which isn't bad at all since a lunch special can easily run you $10 anywhere in Mississauga.  I've only ever had lunch here, I've never seen the chocolate fountain turned on, and this time was my first visit in a couple of years. The dishes offered and the taste of the food hasn't changed much, so there is a high level of consistency here.  Salad - I'm a huge salad fan; some people eat salad to be healthy, I eat salad because I genuinely LOVE salad. Anyways, the salad bar here is good. There's enough sauces, enough toppings, and the greens are fresh (that's super important for me). You can be sure to satisfy your salad fix if you come here.  Hot Foods - A wide selection of Asian and regular buffet foods like black pepper beef, fried rice, tempura yam, sweet and sour pork/chicken, stir fried vegetables, stir fried shrimps, oysters, mashed potatoes, chicken wings, chicken nuggets, pizza, fried-this-and-that, etc. Personally though, I find that although there is a wide selection, there's nothing that I particularly am excited about eating. I eat a lot of Asian food though, so that might just be me. I find a lot of the hot foods satisfactory but not so mind-blowingly good that I look forward to coming again or will crave even after I've left the venue (I feel this way when I go eat sushi).  Sushi Bar - Again, solid selection and taste. I really like the cold tofu here. I enjoy the yam roll. As to be expected, the sushi here isn't \"real\" sushi so its just basic rolls like california, cucumber, crab meat, etc, but it's a nice change for your palate mid meal in case you get sick of eating too much fried food.  Desserts - Not bad, but I consider the desserts the weakest part of the selection here. A lot of their cakes I believe they buy; no complaints about that, but all of them taste kind of mediocre. I wouldn't spit it out, but I'd rather eat another salad instead if I had the appetite. Whenever I come here, I rarely ever touch the cakes, cupcakes, etc. There's a wide range of cakes, but they aren't done very well and the types of cakes they offer aren't anything to get excited about. The ice cream section is good, but my favourite is the crepe station. I usually take the crepe, fill it with ice cream, and then add toppings to it.  All in all, Imperial Buffet is a place I enjoy visiting once in a blue moon. It's solid; good selection, good quality of food, good taste. A 6 or 7 of 10 in my books. However, there's nothing really special about the food here that makes you want to come back. There's nothing particular that is done so well I'll remember it after I leave the restaurant. You can always count on Imperial Buffet for a decent meal at a good price. But is it fantastic? Not by far."}
{"text":"Honestly the place isn't all that bad. But let me tell you why it is a 3 star.  Place is clean, fairly big, has 3 different areas of seating and one of them is pretty open and probably the largest seating room. So this place can handle moderate crowds and partial busy times I'm guessing.  Food has a good variety; small salad bar where the veggies are and then there is another salad bar with all the misc. salads (i.e. potato salad, clam salad, mango salad etc.), then you have the rest of the food like fried stuff, stir fries, rice, noodles, meat, sushi, pizza, seafood, etc. I like it! Similar to Mandarin but I'd say I like this place better. Oh and they have a bigger selection of desserts! Looooooove it!  Staff are ok...nothing special there. Occassionally walking around and checking on people which is expected. Then when it came to closing time they gave us the bill...fine i get why and i won't be upset because people wanna close and go home.  Now the bill. Okay, okay, I didn't look at the sign for prices and I just walked in with a friend cuz we wanted to try the buffet. I didn't look through the pics on Yelp either. SO! This is why I will give a 3 star. The bill was $29.99 without tax. Enough said. Sure their food tasted pretty good but 29.99??? Are they high? What am I eating that deserves 29.99??? These arent any special kinds of food...anyways I was a bit surprised but maybe it's just me and I haven't gone to a buffet in ages on the weekends...but still I find it a bit overpriced...you really need to eat your money's worth here lol"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Their food is pretty okay; average variety of a Chinese buffet. The only thing is that the price is higher than other Chinese buffets and restaurants. I love the offer of the free birthday meal, which is good and competitive. Décor may be on the older side, but it's not a huge issue. We don't get coupons somehow, so that's weird..... Overall, it's a decent restaurant where I'm willing to go back to on a birthday for the free meal."}
{"text":"- good for large groups and families looking to chow-down - however, there are better buffets out there. - to be fair, it's not terrible and inedible. just hard to compare some of the other joints out there if chinese buffet is your thing."}
{"text":"Wow. Limited selection of dry and salty food. Party of 6 arrived to celebrate a birthday, and even though the birthday boy was free, we grossly overpaid at $25 a person. There are a number of AYCE in the area. Go ANYWHERE ELSE."}
{"text":"I must admit this place has come a long way since I started going here back in the day.  The decor remains the same, along with the staff, but the food has gotten much better over the years.    They have a decent array of items including sushi, cooked bbq and steak, Americanized chinese favourites (spring rolls, fried rice, chicken balls, general tao chicken), a cold salad bar, dessert bar and of course some nice sea food choices including my favourite snow crab legs!  The sushi is decent and the cooked food is also better than the mandarin.  The desserts are great and the freshly made waffles are awesome with the wide selection of ice cream!  They often have specials to, like over the holiday it was fresh oysters and scallops.  Keep in mind the staff are extremely tight about handing these items out however and will limit you as much as they can!  Overall waiting staff is attentive and it's a great cheap buffet to feast on!  Be sure to use the buy one get one free coupons as well!"}
{"text":"We've visited this buffet a number of times. Variety of food is OK as far as Asian buffets go. It has the usual staples ranging from meat dishes, seafood (hot and cold) and a sushi bar. The dessert options are also fairly standard with a variety of cakes, ice creams and a chocolate fountain. Their weekend selection improves slightly as it also includes a raw seafood bar during dinner. If you plan to go, keep an eye out for coupons that are frequently available."}
{"text":"Went back again for the crab legs. This time, the legs were not very good. The meat stuck to the shells, and most have very little meat in them. This time, I take back my previous 9/10 rating for the crab legs. This was 6/10 at best.  They also had the scallops and the oysters for the holidays. They were only okay.  Edit: Btw, at the end of the meal, I went to the washroom. I saw a kitchen staff just go to the washroom and walk out without washing his hands. I knew he was a kitchen staff because I followed him out and saw him walk back to the kitchen.  6/10 Overall."}
{"text":"I like this place.  My husband and I are big fans of buffets and this one is we frequent the most when it comes to the GTA. If you go on the weekend, it's $13.99 plus tax for lunch and their selection is great. They offer a mix of Chinese and western dishes, a Sushi bar, a cooking station offering items like roast and skewers, a fruit bar, a huge dessert selection including a chocolate fountain, fresh waffles and an ice cream bar, a salad bar and a soup station.  My personal favorite is their General Tao Chicken.  Even our 21-month old son is already a fan since with all that variety he always finds something he likes to eat as well.  The service is great. The waiters are attentive and friendly. Often they don't even charge us the $2 extra we are supposed to pay since our son eats there as well."}
{"text":"This place has seriously gone down hill since they opened. It used to be cheap and delicious. Now they suck. The prices are the same as the Mandarin except the food and service is awful. Cold and dried out food. The waiters make up excuses as to why you can't use coupons. I emailed the management the last time I went to complain about how bad our experience was I never received a follow up email. I will never go back here again."}
{"text":"did not enjoy this place at all they limit you to certain foods.you also need to pay for hot water.unlike the mandarin where people are very friendly this place did not ask how everything was.what i can say is that they refreshed our water very frequently.Lastly they don't accept debit which is a huge inconvenience  for me."}
{"text":"I attended Imperial Buffet for lunch with my husband today. Upon entering at 2:15 I was hit with a disclaimer that the kitchen would be closing at 3 and the dinning room would be closing at 3:30. I did not expect to see the food stations empty with no signs of anyone restocking them. After tasting the food I knew it was a mistake coming here! The food was cold and tasteless. I approached two people and inquired whether fresh food would be coming out and I was told \"yes\". After finishing 3 pieces of sushi I told my husband I wanted to leave. We connected with a waitress who took us to the front. We were then approached by the manager who demanded that we pay a child's meal price. We tried explaining to him that we were very dissatisfied with the fact that there was no fresh food and on top of that employees were helping themselves to the buffet. Instead of compensating us or trying to resolve the issue he fought with us infront of other customers and told us we must pay. Not once did he ask us about our experience he immediately said you ate you pay. Then he left to check how much food we ate (which was nothing because there was no food available). After he realized that my husband and I would not be paying a dime he told us to get out and never come back. PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE. Spend the extra $4 per person and go to Mandarin where the food is always fresh and the people are always friendly!"}
{"text":"Went last week, didn't get sick this time but very expensive for what it is. Lot's of seafood."}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese Buffet.  I was here with my parents not too long ago.  The place is clean, the staff are nice and the good is great.    We went here for lunch and at the salad bar they had fairly large cocktail shrimps with a nice tangy cocktail sauce.  I must have had a whole plate of them.    This place is not stingy on the shrimp.  There were several dishes with big good-sized shrimp, like a shrimp stir-fry and har gow dumplings (the har gow did have bamboo shoots in it though, which I wasn't too crazy about, I prefer the bamboo-less ones at Wasabi Grand Buffet, but the ones here weren't that bad).  The sushi was very good for Chinese buffet sushi (the seaweed was not smelly like some other places).  The wonton soup was quite good as well.  The wonton wrapping was nice and chewy.  The filling was flavourful chicken and the broth was not too salty.  The wrapping to filling ratio was very high, but that is not unexpected.  The other typical dishes like General Tao chicken, lemon chicken, etc. were nicely done and not overly breaded.    Very large selection of desserts.  I was so stuffed from all the great food I barely had any room for dessert.  Eclairs were good with the custard filling and not fake whipped cream like other places (although I think they also had the cream puffs which looked like they were filled with whipped cream - I didn't try any cream puffs so I don't know if there were good or not).  Nice variety of cakes as well which didn't look too dry.  I should note that while I've never been to the Scarborough location, my parents have and they said that the Mississauga location is a hundred times better.  So if you've been to the Scarborough location and were grossly disappointed (as my parents were), give the Mississauga location a chance and you will be glad that you did.   I would say that this place is my new favourite Chinese buffet in the GTA!"}
{"text":"This is a decent buffet, lots of choices and the price is right.  The design of the buffet could be a little better but hey, I'm not there every day so i guess i can walk around from section to section.  I have been here several times and its hit and miss on the quality once in a while so if they would get that under controll it would head up a few notches on my list.  I have been there some days when the food is spectacular and a couple times when you think they are training new chefs.  Anyway the good outweighs the bad and its a decent place to go as a group."}
{"text":"Pros:  -Eat free on your birthday with one paying adult and the purchase of two drinks ($2.50 for tea/pop) -Acceptable quality crab legs and whelk even on weekdays -Fresh crepes and waffles made on-the-spot  -Ribs were tender and the honey BBQ wings were marinated well  Cons: -WAY too expensive at regular price ($26/adult/weekday night) -Less variety than competitor buffets, most of which were \"Westernized Chinese foods\" -Overall food quality is below average -Nothing particularly \"wow\"ing  Final verdict: I wouldn't consider coming back unless there was another promotion that reduced the cost significantly. My personal overall experience was fine because of the birthday promo but I would never come for full price. I would however like to commend the staff for doing a great job with clearing the finished plates!"}
{"text":"This was a disappointing meal.   My family came to take advantage of their weekend seafood offering: raw oysters, raw abalone, crab legs, mussels, clams, shrimp, etc.  The first thing we got were the cold crab legs. I thought they were a bit dry. My brother found the raw oysters and abalone and brought them back to the table. I smelled the raw seafood as soon as he sat down. That's a bad sign. Raw seafood is supposed to smell like the ocean, if it smells fishy, that means it's gone bad. He was not impressed. I went over to the oyster area and against my own better judgement got one. And yes, the whole area smelled like a fish market. The raw oysters were NOT good. The only seafood I enjoyed were the steam crab legs and the large snails. Everything else (including the sushi) just tasted... off.  They also had roast beef, which was not bad by buffet standards. I also enjoyed their hot and sour soup and their taro dessert soup.   For the most part, the regular buffet food was not as good as other buffets at the same price point, and I definitely wouldn't recommend paying extra for the seafood days."}
{"text":"We had been here before a few times and the food was ok. It appeared to have improved a while back which was encouraging, so we went back today. Horrible. The place was almost empty which should have been a clue. I would be surprised if this franchise survives for very much longer."}
{"text":"If you are a seafood lover, try Imperial's weekend dinner is a good option. They offer shrimp, crab, lobster, clam, scallop and more! I arrived right on 4:30pm when they start serving dinner on Sat, I was shocked to see giant fried lobster in the selection. Other food are typical buffet food. They also have lamb chop, prime rib and grilled shrimp, scallop and calamari at the grilled section. Sushi station also offer sashimi. Weekend dinner for adult is $29.99. We enjoyed 15% off since we have someone in the group in birthday month. Overall, great place if you like buffet!"}
{"text":"The food here is good and the service isn't bad. It's not as good as Mandarin but a bit cheaper and they have crab legs everyday instead of just Friday/Saturday. They also occasionally give out coupons (buy one get one free) and if you come on your birthday with ID you get to eat for free."}
{"text":"Negative stars.  Revolting, cheap, ugh. I felt like the food was sitting out all day, after seeing the dessert table I was excited for that, but I was so wrong. They tasted SO stale.  Do not go here. You'll regret it!"}
{"text":"I give this asian buffet place a 3.5 / 5 stars. It might be because I been to the Scarborough location, I didn't have much expectations going to the Mississauga location. I found the food and service was much better here. Maybe it was a Sunday and the location was a bit awkward, it wasn't too busy, so servers were easily found, friendly, and tables were cleared fast. As for food, seafood lovers would enjoy it here. Some examples are oysters, scallops, lobsters, crabs, shrimps, and sashimi at the sushi bar. For the cook food, it was okay, nothing spectacular. At the fruit and dessert bar, they have many variety and also a freshly made crepes station which was a plus. Overall, I would be glad to come back, especially during birthday month which they offer a discount. If you're age 55 and over and seniors of 65 and over are also offered a discount."}
{"text":"It's Mandarin Part Deux.  I find the food slightly better than Mandarin but not by much.  Don't know if that means anything though.  Its standard mass produced food and you can expect Manchu Wok quality.  On a plus side, they have a chocolate fountain for all you chocolate lovers.  I'm neither a fan of chocolate or Manchu Wok, hence the low rating.  Service: limited as it's a \"get your own buffet\" 2/5 Ambiance: same as Mandarin 2.5/5 Food: 2.5/5 (extra star for chocolate fountain)"}
{"text":"Crab legs on weekdays! Always refilled and never empty. Tasted fresh and not mushy on the day I visited.  They also have a crepe station, where it's made fresh.  However it's a typical Western style Chinese Buffet (think Manchu Wok). Nothing really stood out as much try or mind blowing to the taste bud. But it is one of cheaper buffet of this scale, price wise."}
{"text":"Restaurant has a lot of dishes. Food quality was not bad. Service was extremely poor. They do not honor their own coupons. So watch out!"}
{"text":"Used to be great. We loved this place when it first opened, everything was fresh and there was lots to choose from.  But in the last while they have really gone down hill, most of the food is frozen and is clearly out of a box, the after dinner selection is now horrible, all pre made garbage, I guess they just got greedy, can't wait til they close down."}
{"text":"If you come here on your birthday with at least one other person, you get a free meal (and you need to order two cheap drinks, i.e. pop). That's a pretty good deal. Normally weekend dinners are priced around $30 before tax and tip.. that is high but at least they give you hot and cold crab legs, roast beef, scallops and oysters.  They have a big selection of desserts but none are made in house (all can be bought from supermarkets) except for the crepe.  One time I went they had a chocolate fondue fountain to dip marshmallows and fruits.  Not as great as Dragon Pearl (also not as expensive), but on par with Mandarin."}
{"text":"Food is whatever, old and cold and greasy and certainly unhygienic.     lastly, i hate to eat at a place where someone is constantly watching me eat. hate their staff who looks at every guest as a food thief.  i do not like Chinese food to begin with and this place totally turned me off after what i saw the other table."}
{"text":"Ditto on the closure... although there's a sign on door saying closed \"today\" due to a \"sewage backup\" it's been there for much longer than one day. As well, their phone number is not being answered during business hours, the location's page no longer exists and the main page and coupon registration no longer show this location.  I've reported it closed here but it takes a while and/or more confirmation reports before it updates.  It certainly wasn't high-end, but it was sufficient that it was a good value with the BOGO coupons. Looks like too good a value...  Edit: No idea why it is taking so long, considering the Ajax location here has the Closed flag already for a week and this one has been closed for two. I passed by last night during \"business hours\" so I've posted a couple of photos. Wakey wakey Yelp! :^p  Edit2: I passed by on Mar. 25 (4 days ago) and the sign on the front door now says \"CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS\". I'm not holding my breath for a reopening but this is interesting at least.  Edit3: I passed by again Apr. 21 (yesterday.) The \"CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS\" sign is gone and the yellow \"Close today due to a sewage back up\" is... back up. There are still blinds down but managed to peek through them and most of the chairs and tables are gone from the interior... doesn't look promising.  Edit4: As of May 9th both the \"sewage\" and 'renovations\" signs are gone... no more pretense it's ever reopening. The Mississauga location has also closed, and http://imperialbuffet.com/ now redirects to a seller of custom bobbleheads. Brampton Spoonful is still around though."}
{"text":"I went with a group on a Monday night at 7 pm. The place was pretty busy considering it was a weekday. The staffs were friendly and filled our glasses with water quite often but there was no ice in the water... I started with the cold seafood section and had the shrimp, muscles and baby octopus. The shrimp's texture was off and the smell wasn't quite right. It tasted ok with the overly thick seafood sauce so I ate it anyway. The muscles were good. I tried the baby octopus but i think it was raw so it wasn't edible after the first one. I then went on to the hot section. They had a good selection but a lot of the meat looked old or like it was sitting under the heat lamp all day or maybe even leftovers from another day... The food from the grill was really good and seemed fresh. The fruits (strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, watermelon, grapes, pineapple) were all perfectly ripe and the desserts were delicious!"}
{"text":"Worst buffet ever.     We've been here several times in the past and have always been OK with the place.  We knew it wasn't the best, but we always came with the BOGO coupons so it was kind of worth it.  We went today (Saturday) for lunch to celebrate my mother in law's birthday.   It opened around 11:30... And we showed up around 11:45.   There was nothing out except for some salad and desserts.   We thought OK, we're kind of early.. No problem.  But at least bring some soups out...is that too much to ask??  12:00....About 5 trays filled throughout the place... And they empty fast because everyone is hungry.    No soup, no sushi, no rice or noodles...   We grab what scraps we can find because we're starving.  12:15... Maybe a quarter of the trays are out  at this point.   Only  a couple work has trying.  12:30... still not even half the trays are out... WTF.   From the comments other families are making, they are a little peeved like us.  12:45... the soups are finally coming out and some sushi (no soya sauce though, that came out after 1pm).  1:00... We're starting to finish up at this point.. Going for the  desserts.   Still a quarter of the food trays are missing (not emptied of food... They just never came out).   About a quarter of trays that were there were empty and hadn't been no refilled for quite a while.  1:15... Time to leave.   Only gave a 5% tip.   I felt  bad leaving so little, while at the same time was questioning if that was too much.  This was probably our 10th visit  to this location in Ajax.  We normally go around this time... And when we did before there were only a few trays short... And the rest appeared shortly after.   We have never had an experience there as bad as this before.   It was almost as if they weren't expecting to open for a few more hours...or at all.     Not.   Going.   Back.   Ever."}
{"text":"This place is a feeding trough, don't get it twisted. It looks like a cafeteria, you're seated way too close to the strangers, and they could do the floors a little more often. The selection is awesome, though. Some of the sushi has actual fish in it, unlike the competitor. Crab legs are offered every night (I'd never had crab legs until I came here. I'm an addict now). Coupons are ALWAYS in the mail box for BOGO so its dirt cheap. I'd recommend a trip here every six months."}
{"text":"It is a nice place to eat .All the food are fresh. Many  choices .  A lot of Seafood  . All the staffs are friendly. Clean up the plate very fast."}
{"text":"Came here because we got a coupon in the mail.  I have been to the one in Scarborough and this location beats them in all aspects of:  customer service food tasted great washroom decor over all being clean  First off the woman at the front greeted us with a smile, told us it would be a 5-10 minute wait. Which was great.   PEOPLE READ THE COUPON it clearly states cash only and show them before you sit down. DUH!  Anyway less than 5 minutes we are being escorted into our seats and right away we are asked what beverage we want.  Looking around this place is brightly lit, clean, the floors aren't sticky, neither is the carpet.  Staff are all smiling, they have a welcoming vibe to them. Also CLEAN uniform, and they are wearing it properly like nothing is hanging out weird and its CLEAN.  So the food area has lots to offer. Just like Scarborough but the food is steaming hot, and not even close to being \"warm\" There is a person constantly cleaning any mess any patrons have made, she to is also smiling. All the foods are clearly labeled and not dirty with food finger prints like the one in Scarborough.  When I need my plate to be cleared there is someone around, and water is usually topped up before I can even reach the bottom!  Washroom is clean!  Parking is a bit tricky but I found that if you have one person go in and get a table while the other one is waiting for someone to come out its all good because you don't usually get the table right away...So by the time the driver gets in you've got a table.  There's a plaza next to this spot but I don't know if there's cameras or not if you wanted to sneak in that area for a fast parking spot.  Anyway overall I enjoyed myself here. Wish they would have this kind of staff in the Scarborough location."}
{"text":"I hate this place. If you read my reviews i'm pretty forgiving, or i'm polite.  NOT that my opinion is always spot on but still. This is the first 1 star and if I could give a half star I WOULD!  My family celebrates birthdays, anniversaries, all sorts here. AND I HATE IT. I have now started making up excuses not to go if they say there celebrating it here. I feel sorry for my aunts/uncles who pay so much per person for such crap food, and crap service. So why go if ill already be a debby downer.  The food is not all that great to begin with usually warm close to being cold than it being hot going to warm..kind of like it was just sitting in the back just waiting for the tray of food outside to be consumed and tada refill right away!. The interior looks dirty from the minute you walk in from the tons of people walking in with their kids and slapping their snot, or saliva all over the doors. Only to see this clean when the people are all either gone or away from the front.  The floors are sticky even going on carpeted areas, which shouldn't be sticky but it is.  The washroom's smell, and it doesn't look like anyone clears out the garbage as often as possible.   The staff don't even greet you with a smile, nor do they even care if you need  anything.   I think what's change my family's mind about going here is when the party is over and its now time to compare the count, they always double count people. WHY...When we confirmed a certain amount of people we usually go UNDER not over because going over we have to pay for people who dont show up.   ok we confirm 120 people but 125 people show up...we pay extra thats fine. but if we confirm 130 and only 125 show up we still somehow had to pay 5 extra people.  NOW. They still dont give enough tables, chairs or room when you confirm 120 people it was like 100 chairs and all squished into this small area when clearly they could have given us a private room not having to share with another event or have their other patrons annoyed with how loud our party was getting when all they wanted was a peaceful lunch.  Again because there wasnt enough chairs and table and room for at least 120 when people sat down they were being counted again because new cutlery and cups were provided. My Grandfather said to the woman to stop taking his cup and cutlery she said it was her job he said well stop adding another line to your damn paper! Ive been here since the beginning of the party!  ANYWAY as if that wasnt enough these people expected a tip of like 100+ dollars. I have no problem giving tip. BUT staff was hard to approach, they even told my aunt to wait when all she was asking for was smaller plates for cake which in the end she just walked up to the dessert area and grabbed herself. There is another reason but I want to keep that for myself I do not want to get into trouble for blasting this on the internet...  Parking is huge its right next to the movies, and a kid play place, and a jewelry store. It is Scarborough so keep all valuables out of sight.  Hope this review helps you avoid this place!    SOMEONE TELL ME WHY IS THE IMPERIAL BUFFET IN MISSISSAUGA SO MUCH BETTER? That will be my next review! They actually get 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Plentiful and adequate seafood and desserts along with the customary cooked Asian staples make this a reasonable buffet for decent quality at decent price. Raw oysters were not amazing, but they were okay. Raw scallops and smoked salmon were a little better. The ice cream is much better than usual buffet fare, and the lactose-free orange sherbert was nice and tangy. The prime rib was disappointing, skip it for the beef ribs or lamb instead. Only cold crab legs when we went, but good quality and still tasty.  Pro tip: Best items hands down were the very popular Canto style pork belly and the very overlooked \"Spicy chicken sandwich\", a savoury Taiwanese-style \"bao\" near the prime rib that a ton of Westerners passed over, likely not knowing what it was. Also, go with a group in the month of someone's birthday for 15% off everyone's tab."}
{"text":"If I could give a -3 review, I would.  The price was fine considering that we had a coupon averaging out to $12 per person. However, the food was under par as most of it was either stale, dry or out for too long.  Now here's the final kicker. The customer service. The absolute shitty service that I've experienced today only about 15 minutes prior to writing this review is what prompted me to create a Yelp account just to make this comment.  The wait staff, which the waiter refused to give his name after publicly waving a finger at my mother and yelling at her for trying to share a random act of kindness to a neighbouring table with some misfortune. In this case, the group beside us brought an expired coupon and was not aware of it but was told to purchase drinks anyways. Now on top of that, we tried to offer one of ours since we had an extra as a token of kindness.  Then this waiter comes by and waves his finger tossing the two back at us. You know it was THAT bad when one of the other staff members had to apologize on the behalf of the pig headed individual.  If it wasn't accepted, fine. Leave it at that. But having to overexaggerate and make a big scene out of it where all nearby tables are staring at us - that is another story.  Not only has this waiter single handedly ticked this family off, embarrassed and made a big scene for the neighbouring family sitting next to us, but may have very well questioned whether or not the entire dining room will continue to support this restaurant.  It's an absolute disgrace. No apologies. No remorse.  Well looks like who has zero shits to give and has no intentions of returning to this or any of their sister restaurants."}
{"text":"It'll do. I came to this Imperial Buffet location for the first time last night. $25/person for adults. It's kinda cute that they also have prices for older adults (55-64?) and a separate price for seniors (65+). Children are 1/2 the adult price.  I haven't been to Imperial Buffet in years, and only their Scarborough location. This one's got a few things that their Scarborough one doesn't, or didn't, like mini quiches (which look remarkably like the frozen ones you get at Costco), and various kinds of breads and rolls I couldn't and refused to identify.   Pros:  Their cold seafood selection includes things like shrimp (I heard they were watery), some kind of sea snail, clams, mussels, and baby octopus (which were surprisingly tender).  Their teriyaki salmon fillet was very tender. Could have used a touch less sauce though. It was a tad too sweet and overwhelmed the salmon.  They have a fridge for their individual mousse cups, yogurt cups, jello cups, and cream puffs. I like that people haven't (hopefully) been breathing on them and they haven't been sitting at room temp forever.  They have a crepe/waffle station, made to order.  Cons:   The lady who made my crepe placed the crepe on my finger when I handed her the plate. Hot crepe + finger = not so much fun.  The mango yogurt was actually yogurt. Vanilla yogurt. Couldn't taste the mango at all, even though a bit of mango puree was sitting on top of the yogurt.  The steak tenderloin cubes (at the grill station) had been given way too much meat tenderizer, so while they were fairly tender, they had no beef taste whatsoever.  The prime rib and the lamb were dry. As in so dry no one went to the carving station. I've never seen this happen at a buffet before.  They have bubblegum mousse, or something that tasted exactly like what bubblegum mousse would have tasted like. Traumatic. Absolutely traumatic.  If you want Chinese buffet, this will probably sate that craving, but I wouldn't say it's particularly outstanding."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been coming here since it opened and the waiters all know us."}
{"text":"Other people's recommendation motivated me to drive all the way to Ajax for Imperial Buffet. I must say it was worth it. The menu collection is good if not extraordinary. A good mix of Asian and Western dishes are available. I specially liked the steak. Yes, they do offer steak, and it is average quality in my opinion. The buffet setting is nice. There are plenty of space available for small group gathering of 7-8 people."}
{"text":"This place missed the mark. Came here at 8pm on a Saturday night of a long weekend and they began shutting down food stations. I think that's completely ridiculous. So we had to consume food that's been sitting there all day or noodles that were pretty much stuck to the pan because the steamers over cooked them. I overheard a lady try to get some roast beef but they had no more and weren't going to make more.  They also had fresh oysters but it seemed like there wasn't any food safety initiated because they had been left out for a while. Raw oysters out of the shell must be consumed within two hours or else they make people sick. There was also a sign that said \"two per person please\", which doesn't seem right at a buffet?  Closer to 9pm an on shift manager brought in his two friends and they dined together. I can overlook a manager sitting down and eating with customers but he also turned the table diagonally so they could see each other better. The turned table was just so prominent in the dining room it looked ridiculous. I don't think I'd ever come back here again."}
{"text":"Gone back a couple of times and the standard has been raised. The crab leg clusters are the best in town. They are not drenched in water, and come out the shell nice and clean. The overall appearance is a lot cleaner than my first visit.  I did use one of their own coupons which came through the mail, and I was happy to see that they had raised their standards."}
{"text":"Great buffet, and they frequently send out buy one get one free coupons . Food is is of high quality and they have a sushi and dessert bar in addition to the regular buffet fare."}
{"text":"Food was very poorly cooked, and taste was not very pleasant. Service was unprofessional, whole experience was just terrible. Not happy with their pricing either. Highly do not recommend."}
{"text":"A Chinese buffet, with standard selections of \"chinese\" food. Came here with a group of friends & used a coupon to knock down the price a bit.  Noteworthy items are crab legs,beef roast & baked mutton.   Crab legs were hot & fresh when I went, beef roast was good, not too tough, & the mutton was loaded with flavour & was very juicy.  Coupon made it all worth it, knocked 18 dollars off the price at the end of the night...I would never go otherwise.   For Chinese buffet I would recommend going to Dragon Pearl instead."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times over the past and the weekend is always (in my opinion) the best time to come because I think the staff are more on their toes with serving the customers. lol Anyway, the food is good. Nothing too amazing. Much as you would expect a usual buffet to taste and the selections are pretty okay. Plus the place is big so its good to bring a large party if you want to dine with them compared to other places I've been."}
{"text":"Don't let the modern look of the exterior facade or the inside layout fool you. The food here is pure and unrepentant garbage. Even the most foolproof of dishes are done wrong - be it stale, burnt, dried out, or seasoned with who-knows-what. There's simply no attention to quality in any way.  For a big buffet experience stick with Mandarin. They do it right."}
{"text":"The great thing for this place is that they will offer free buffet meal for the birthday person, but you need to bring a paying guest and order minimum of 2 drinks. The drink requirement is little weird.  The variety of menu offering was amazing and the food was good.   Cons: the decor, does not match with the offerings. The fresh oyster were not fresh, but other foods were fine.   Worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"After my visit today I am finally willing to write a review for this location.  Before now I would have rated it 3 stars which in my opinion isn't worth reviewing as no one wants to read about an average restaurant.   Recently they have added more to their grilled food offering.  Now in addition to the Angus roast beef and pork loin you can have sausage,  pork pieces,  beef ribs,  zucchini,  sweet potatoe and pineapple. I might have missed something but look at the picture to see this smorgasbord!   Personally I avoid breaded and overly processed foods but like everyone else that's a personal choice so I can't comment on most of their other dishes.  However I see people going back for seconds of most things. With this in mind for dessert I recommend the creme brule.  I love both their hot and cold crab legs.  But take this tip and only choose the brightly coloured ones.  The darker legs and claws taste OK,  but the meat does not come out willingly.   Sign up to their newsletter and you will almost always have a bogo coupon which combined with these new additions to the menu make it an affordable dinner for two.   To reach five stars I would have to point to the wait staff.  While most are attentive to clearing plates and refilling water, they should raise the bar and watch for other guest needs like extra napkins,  crab cracker tools or a quick wipe of a table between plates if the table needs it.   Finally it might appear to be a trivial detail but the new salt and pepper shakers on the tables reassures me that they are always looking to improve.   Otherwise it's always a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"2.5 / 5  Imperial buffet is similar to mandarin or other typical chinese-american food buffets, although the quality is slightly inferior.  This is a disappointing to say the least considering mandarin doesn't exactly have high quality food either.  The price for the buffet is a bit cheaper than mandarin, which at least somewhat justifies the slightly worse food.  Imperial buffet has a good selection of dishes to choose from ranging from your standard fried rice to kung pao chicken and even an entire section devoted to desserts, which are also included with the buffet price.  None of the food is inedible per se, but nothing stands out either, all just simple quickly mass produced items.  The interior of the restaurant is a mixed bag.  It's mostly clean and fairly new looking, but the layout is somewhat confusing with multiple sectioned rooms all circling a central room where the food is located.  After getting my food i sometimes find myself disoriented as to where my seat is.  The service is usually good although when it is busy sometimes they take excessively long to serve you.  Overall a decent place but most of the food is just standard chinese food that you can get at any fast food restaurant.  Quantity over quality in this case."}
{"text":"Overpriced, limited selection and mediocre service even below your standard buffet expectations. This place does not warrant the drive there even if it was just to use the BOGO coupons they frequently spam my mailbox with. I am somewhat of a fan of their other location in Mississauga but this is like the polar opposite. Notably absent on weekdays are the AYCE crab legs. I would avoid this place like the plague. CASH ONLY when using coupons."}
{"text":"Imperial Buffet is a good Chinese buffet. They have alot of seafood like snow crab legs, sea scallops and oysters. The hot and cold dishes have alot of variety and are solid and replenished often. The desserts are numerous, basically has something for everyone. Service was good, they're hustling. Overall a good buffet experience. I ate until I was around 130% full so it was worth it.  Just -1 star because the snow crab legs arent precracked. Destroyed their fork breaking it open!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience in this restaurant . It was good before , but the food was taste horrible now !! The seafood is not fresh at all !! And some of the food r not cooked !!!"}
{"text":"My husband loves Chinese buffet & quite likes this place, it's right next to the theatre and we also receive coupons pretty regularly in the mail. That's a great incentive to go.   My favorite part of this buffet is going on the weekends when the crab legs are available. I do like there is a sushi section because I love seaweed salad but really wished there was some some sashimi. Trying to find some sort of healthy but tasty options at a buffet can be tricky. Mind you I don't mind going in for the extra WW points if it's for something that's going to be really tasty but the standard chicken balls, wings, calamari doesn't do it for me but AJ likes it & it's important for hubby to be happy.   I much prefer the Pearl Dragon buffet (great selection) over the Imperial but it's not quite as close for us."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with the gf last night as I had a 2 for 1 coupon.   The options are a little less than mandarin but we didn't mind as the gf wanted the crab legs and sushi. Had a little of everything and found the food ok.   My total bill was $32 which included 2 drinks, tax and tip. Will be back .. if I have a coupon again :)"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely terrible.   There was no variety of food at all. The only good things they had were the fried chicken wings and the roast beef. Even the salad bar (if you can even call it that) was crappy. No toppings at all.   Ended up paying $33/person. Was it worth it? NO.  Go to Mandarin down the street, they have better variety and bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Was visiting friends in the area and wanted to grab dinner before heading home.This was quite the trek for us in the first place.  I heard bad reviews but decided to try it anyhow.  What a big mistake.  The food (IMHO), was terrible. Really poor quality and very greasy.  Not a fan of Chinese buffets in general, but this was truly the worst we've had."}
{"text":"This resturant is reasonably priced for the amount of food that its there.  The food is very tasty and has a good variety of proteins and plenty for vegitarians.   It has more than enough desserts for all.  The wait staff is friendly and quickly come to clear the table and drinks."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of buffet !!! But this place is worst place ever !!!! This food is not fresh and taste bad ...Even food count taste much better !!!! OMG !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food for the price: roast lamb every night and a wide variety of seafood (even for lunch) and dessert including crepe. Weekend with duck, lobster, crab, sashimi and oysters. You can ask them to be put on their email list. Now till February, I have 2 for the price of one coupons for both lunch and dinner Monday to Thursday. It is better than Mandarin and Dragon Legend.  However, on February 18th, I noticed the restaurant has started to enforce a 10% service charge on the sub-total (MEAL COST + Tax). That means the tax portion has an increase by 10%. Who needs Canada's tax to increase by 10%?  One important note: service charge fee is supposed to be a tip that should be a voluntary contribution reward based on how satisfied a customer is from being served by the servers.  With a compulsory tip, it takes away the incentive for the servers to serve well. I usually tip slightly more than 10% of the meal cost before tax. With what they have recently started, I no longer have the same appetite to eat there once a week."}
{"text":"Craving some Mandarin? Go to Imperial Buffet. You won't regret it; although very similar, it's \"n\" times better! Brownie points if it's your birthday - you eat for free.   My buffet picks, you ask? In no specific order, here goes:   1. Prime Rib with gravy 2. Shanghai Noodles 3. Calamari / Squid Rings 4. Steamed Dumplings 5. Wonton Soup 6. Seaweed Salad 7. Chocolate and Vanilla Cupcakes"}
{"text":"If you aren't expecting a gourmet meal (why would you be?) then you shouldn't be disappointed.   The obvious comparison: Mandarin. I will give the slight edge to Mandarin in the food quality/taste department. Decor/ambience...well, they're both buffets but Mandarin gets the edge here easily. The biggest difference, to me, are the staff. Mandarin servers/greeters/et al are much friendlier, more outgoing and pretend to actually be pleased to see you patronizing their workplace.  The surly attitudes at Imperial need to go. Nary a smile to be seen from their servers. Ignore you when you thank them for filling up your water.   Food wise, there is much more selection at Imperial, but it seems the selection comes at the cost of taste. Again, I'm not expecting a gourmet experience here but the dishes are just...meh. Nothing mindblowing, but not gross or offensive in any way. They do keep the stuff pretty hot and fresh at least.   Sushi is usually surprisingly good considering it's a Chinese buffet.   Desserts are all obviously storebought. I am a fan of the waffles though (they make them way too slow at Mandarin and there never seem to be any!)   Parking is easy enough, though Tuesday evenings can be a bit of a headache as it's right beside the theater.   To sum up...if this location closed, I'd happily welcome a different buffet in it's place at a similar price point. But it gets the job done for now when the family is in the mood to pig out on \"Chinese food\" for slightly cheaper than at Mandarin.   Definitely check it out if you get the buy 1 get 1 free coupon!"}
{"text":"Service is awesome.  Not good food.  They don't got a lot of stuff for buffet. Dinner is around $25/ person. .. you can go to a lot of good buffet for that. Like Mandarin, pizza hut buffet, Franky's Tomato."}
{"text":"*The 3 star rating is based on regular prices if you do not have coupon.*   Came here for lunch today with coupon.  Love how they have breakfast items during lunch (sausage, home fries).  We had a buy one get one free coupon (drink purchase now required).  The waiter asks if you have a coupon when they bring you to your table (coupon regularly found in flyers sent to your home if you live in the area).    Current regular prices :  Mon-Thurs Lunch $13.99 Mon-Thurs Dinner $20.99 Fri-Sun Lunch $16.99 Fri-Sun Dinner $24.99  Food quality was good.  It helps when there are a lot of people so the food stays fresh with high turnover rate.  They have a good variety of food : chinese, indian (curry chicken), pizza, sushi, fruits, dessert, ice cream, soup, and a chocolate fountain.  It was a full house today with a someone holding a party of 100 people.  We notice the restaurant is very multicultural (even when compared to other buffets).  Parking was not a problem and we never have to line up."}
{"text":"Buffet!! Yes!! Imperial Buffet!!....uhhh ok??  My family is a big buffet kinda of family..and their favorite is Imperial Buffet...Why you ask?  King Crab legs (which you can get at most buffets) and because the staff knows them so well that they call my dad by name.  If your talking selection and variety at Imperial..it has the basic genre of all you can eat soups, salads, sushi, grill table and a mixture of pseudo-Canadian Chinese foodstuffs on the warm tables and a variety of ice creams and boxed desserts.  Quality of the food is average fast food Chinese..mostly deep fried or sauteed in a wok.  The service is good and friendly (since they know my family) they always accommodating.  If I had to choose...I would go there...only if I had to with my family..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Much better than mandarin, more selection and cheaper. To my surprise, has lots of seafood options even for lunch (blue crab, mussels, clams, etc). Good variety of dessert options - mostly thawed frozen cakes on top of the usual bite sized desserts, crepes/waffles and ice cream. There's also a unique grill section that is full serve and a sushi bar. Chocolate fountain can also be found near the fruits."}
{"text":"The other night I went to imerial, and I did not expect. And in the end I was not impressed. Don't get me wrong the food was great and plenty of it. Even the price was well worth what you can eat, a full course meal with dessert for under twenty dollars. But what I didnt like was the seating area, reminded me of a cafeteria at school. So would I go back, probably not but if you with a group then it worth it."}
{"text":"I came here for the dinner buffet with my boyfriend and his relatives. This was my first time trying this buffet. I have to say their seafood offerings in this buffet was good. There was king crab legs, muscles, clams, fresh oysters, fresh scallops, and shrimps. For a buffet, this place had a lot of selection. But the food quality, I have to say was only satisfactory."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this place because we enjoy the chocolate fountain in particular ( which is not availble at all times though ) and  It has a fairly vast selection that is usually pretty fresh and well prepared. Everything from Soup, Sushi, Crab Legs, Fresh Crepes and Ice Cream can be found here with some variation as well to spice things up.  I will agree that the selection of entrees was nowhere near the desserts and salads   The service can go either way here though, it can be excellent at times and other times not so much but I have never really been all that bothered or concerned with service here, In a buffet scenerio things are different I suppose.  Parking is excellent; there is literally a HUGE parking lot and the building is next to a busy little plaza with a large parking lot as well."}
{"text":"This buffet is a waste of time. There is not much selection of foods. The decor of the restaurant is old and boring. They had folding tables which I thought was so cheap. I wouldn't recommend this buffet for anyone."}
{"text":"Food Quality: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Parking: 4/5 Dining Area: 3/5 Value: 4/5  Good for hosting parties and get togethers.  Its not special but you'll be full when you're done."}
{"text":"Wow not much to say. Deserts were super fake and made cheaply or from a box. The food it self was very bland.. Service was poor. Walked in and was first inline but was some how 3rd to be setted. Waiter left up to 2-3 plates on table before taking then away, but managed to keep pop filled. I gave it 2 stars cause I was lucky to have a 2 for 1 deal. If it was not for the two for one i'd have gave it 1. Even with a 2,4,1 deal I dont think ill go back.."}
{"text":"Not recommended... Food is cold, and not tasty. Freshness is an issue. Things are obviously kept there until the color and texture changes and start to look pale and not appealing. Didn't like most of the dishes I tried.  Service is ok"}
{"text":"Spend the extra $3 and go to The Mandarin. Seriously.   I'm actually surprised there are so many good reviews.. I can't believe it could be this bad the day we went just by fluke..   The food was very stale and obviously very low quality (it was pretty gross and I had sampled almost everything to try to find something good! And I'm seriously not a picky eater!)  Granted we went on a Monday at 730 and it was dead.. But think about it.. Good Chinese take out tastes good the next day, even cold!  They clearly had no regard for the FIFO rule (first in first out) we saw them pile new noodles on top of old noodles lol. You know how you can tell when stuff has been sitting there? Just dry looking.. Everything was like that. If it's dead why put out so much food so it just sits there? Also all the bread was HARD.   So anyways I was the only one at my table who had the sushi (maki).. And yay.. I got sick! I told the waitress and she just gave me a blank stare (lol). They were also really sketchy about it being my friends birthday.. Like: \"You have to come to the front and pay cash and have ID\" in a way that I felt like we were trying to rip them off because they advertise free dinner on your birthday?   So bottom line: old stale sub par food, probably health code violations that'll make you sick, and unhelpful, unfriendly staff.   Seriously it's like $2 more to go to Mandarin, where if the food is gross and you get sick they won't just stare at you. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Not many good buffets out there anymore, but this one is FAR better than The Mandarin. In fact, I think anyone who has been here, will find it EXTREMELY difficult to go back to Mandarin. Unlike Mandarin, there is more than the salad bar that offers edible food, but like Mandarin plenty of it is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Well, I had a whelk today. Apparently that's a sea snail. I didn't know what to dip it in, so I used the soy sauce - that's stored in a teapot in the sushi area.  The sushi selection is poor but probably adequate to most sushi eaters. There are various kinds of rolls topped in different ways, but they can be summarized mostly as 'tempura roll with things on top' where the topping rotate between mango, avocado and smoked salmon. The rolls in general looked quite sad in appearance. Note that any salmon served on the sushi here is smoked salmon, not sashimi grade salmon. Having seen some of the other pictures, maybe (hopefully) the sushi selection was better once upon a time, or maybe a fuller selection is served on fridays and weekdays (eg. including eel sushi).  The best area is probably just on the other side of the prep area from the sushi - where they have honey garlic chicken wings, lobster balls, \"oyster miyozaki' (sp?), bbq beef short ribs and deep fried capelins. You also couldn't self-serve in this area either, you had to request it so I guess they know that too.  They have a whole table full of seafood - shrimp, mussels, crab legs and whelk. Unfortunately, it must not get very high turnover on weekday nights so ice was also put on top of the seafood.  The butter chicken is very watery. The sour cream for the baked potatoes was never refilled. Char siu and shanghai noodles were good. The lettuce in the salad area was fresh. The lobster bisque (probably also premade?) was also good.  They had a surprisingly large selection of cakes, pies and other desserts. I do wish that the tofu delight would be served with syrup rather than brown sugar. Many of the other desserts were obviously of the store-bought variety. My significant other assured me that not only were the gummies \"fresh\" (eg. not hard and stale) but they were also the same ones that Rexall uses in their store-branded candies. Also - waffle and crepe station.  Service was fine. Definitely much of the staff is Cantonese speaking and they always kept our table clear of plates. I really appreciate how every dish and sauce was labelled without fail - how many times have you been to a buffet and had to guess at what something was?  This place is very overpriced at regular rates, the only thing that draws in people are the coupons and birthday special - you know how commonly those are used when manager greets you and asks if you have a coupon or birthday after asking how many people were in your group. Regular weekday price is $25.99 + $2.50 per drink."}
{"text":"BAD....OVERPRICED..POOR QUALITY...Indigestion...UGH!  Hadn't gone in a couple years but OMG it has gone downhill. spend $5 more and go to Mandarin if you want to hit a chinese buffet.  Everyone in our Party of nine was feeling ill later and vowed NEVER to go back."}
{"text":"This place is closed down, along with the Ajax location. Went to go make reservations for a group and no longer there :( Checked their website and those 2 location taken off the page. Only one listed was Brampton"}
{"text":"It's definitely a generic chinese buffet. That being said, the chicken fried rice and anything with shrimp in it, I could have eaten plates of. The dessert tables looked delicious and everything I tried tasted amazing! The garlic bread with cheese was surprisingly good, but make sure you get it when they put a fresh hot batch out."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of 8 ppl on a tuesday evening.  The place was not busy at all sat in eating area with probably 2 other dinner parties in there.  The food itself was hit and miss.  Some of the food tasted fresh and some of the food seemed like it was carried over from the day before. So its like a 50-50 chance of getting something fresh or not. Paid around $24 per person really wouldn't spend that much unless i was going to mandarin or a sushi buffet since i know everything cooked there is cooked fresh.  I would go if they werw to drop their prices by $5 totally not worth the prices of other better buffets.  Convenient location nice staff amd lots of parking so thats a bonus.  Check it out if they charge extra for xmas holiday prices i would not check it out. 100 percent"}
{"text":"It was good, but not that great, some of the dishes were yummy while there's tasted like they were made like 3 days earlier. There are better buffets in the city."}
{"text":"Mandarin is much better (to make a direct comparison).  Why you ask...well for starters I have been to Imperial twice and both times half of the food trays are empty limiting selection.  Furthermore the food is better at Mandarin.  My favourite item at buffets is torpedo shrimp.  Unfortunately at Imperial its over-battered and you can't taste the shrimp.  The hot meal section is definitely the highlight here.  Though when you want desert you can choose from some normal ice cream flavours, which is fine but Mandarin has the options to make a delicious sundae.  Imperial is not a particularly terrible place, but drive 10 minutes to Mandarin on Kingston Road to enjoy a far better Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 10 over the Valentine's Day weekend and was skeptic due to the reviews I was reading on route but glad we stuck through as my heart fell for cupid's invite in falling in love with this place. Great staff, super accommodating and I can't say that enough. We were seated after about 20 minutes, which was surprising as the entrance was full and we had no reservations.    My requests of putting two tables together had 3 members of their staff orchestrating amidst a sea of hungry patrons, take note: some were not so impressed with our entourage bombarding in with a crew of staff speaking in their native tongue debating which table to give us..  Oh dear, most diners who glared angrily seemed dateless, impatient and extra hungry because again... dateless and here for the love of stuffing your face until having a date in the first place would've hindered all possibilities of indulging, so coming here 'dateless' was beginning to bring meaning to 'single and loving it'. Cheers to my dateless yet happy foodies!!!   On the other hand, hubby and I took our nephews and nieces including our baby girl for a hearty treat to an AYCE to avoid catering to one's craving and instead this place fed our hungry warriors happily with an incredible selection of sushi, meat and lots of meat including ribs, steak and seafood cravings?! Shrimp galore (fried and fresh), oysters and clams, crab legs!! YAS! DESSERT wasn't even ready for this troupe.  Staff was quick to clear our tables, more napkins here, another order of drinks there and every request answered with a smile despite the busy night we chose.   It's quite rare that a buffet makes good sushi, so I was blown away when hubby had me try their green dragon rolls and that was that! I made a beeline for the rolls myself and then 2 dozen of the oysters(fairly fresh, they only give 2 at a time so plenty of trips made) and racked on some chocolate covered strawberries and perfectly satisfied.   Atmosphere is great, located in a fairly new modern plaza. The cold weather and tight parking didn't damper anyone's mood which thank God made way to a very nice evening with the family."}
{"text":"The Imperial Buffet is located north of Highway 2 and Harwood, behind the big huge plaza that sprawls the length of Highway 2 between Harwood and Salem. It can be hard to find so keep an eye out for the turn into the plaza.  We came here on a Thursday evening and it was PACKED! We had about a 15 minute wait before we were seated at our table and then we were able to dig right into the buffet. In my opinion, Imperial is just a poor substitute for Mandarin, if we're being honest. It's slightly cheaper and they offer coupons (everyone but us had a coupon) but they don't have nearly the same selection and the food just isn't as good.  That being said, we enjoyed a few plates of the hot buffet, which includes prime rib, lots of seafood including hot and cold shrimp, crab legs (I don't have them but they're very popular), all of the standard chinese fare, like chicken balls, chicken fried rice, sweet and sour pork, etc, and some american fare, like french fries, onion rings and pizza. I rarely get salad or soup at buffets but they had quite a selection here. The main thing to come to Imperial for is the dessert area. This area is the main sort of focus when you walk into the buffet room, they have all kinds of pies and squares, a fresh waffle station with toppings, an ice cream bar and a fruit bar. Good selection and everything was decent.  The service here is what's to be expected from a buffet. Our \"server\" came by once to get a drink order and then one of the busgirls was at our table more often than anyone else. I certainly hope she ended up getting a portion of the tip we left.   Overall, the Imperial is a decent meal, if you have a coupon its probably a better reason to go but if you're in AJax, you may as well just drive the extra 10 minutes to Pickering and go to the Mandarin where you'll get more choice and better food and probably better service too."}
{"text":"No, just no.  They are capitalising on the nearby traffic for business.  No one goes to this place cause the food is bland and the the selection is very limited compared to other chinese buffets...  Why would you settle for 25 bucks for mediocre buffet when you can go to Mandarin.    Service is underwhelming, I've been there 3 times, each time I go there, the waiter rushes and shoves the bill at me, as if I was going to sneak out without paying.  Its not even busy there...  For the love of god, don't eat any fruits or ice cream, if a waiter see's you with it, he will fly at you with the bill even if its your first item."}
{"text":"This place was..as it says, A-OK. Nothing spectacular, but not bad either. The buffet has a wide variety of foods, but I wouldn't exactly call it a 'Chinese' buffet, since there was lot of stuff that I would not consider \"Chinese\" food - ie. roasted lamb, corn, mashed potatoes, fries, onion rings, pizza, etc.  They did have a big selection of seafood - crab legs, grilled calamari, lobster bisque...too bad I'm not a big seafood fan!   Standard buffet fare - general Tso chicken, spring rolls, fried rice, torpedo shrimp... but one glaring omission. So glaring, that I thought about removing a star from this review... NO CHICKEN BALLS! How in the heck can you have a Chinese buffet without chicken balls? I was flabbergasted. I even asked to make sure. While this did not spoil my dining experience, I was definitely disappointed.   Desserts were nice. Big selection of miniature cakes and pies, with fresh made crepes. The cookies and creme cheesecake was unexpectedly delightful, though the ice cream flavours (a highlight at the Mandarin) left much to be desired...plus no toppings :(  I'm mixed on this place. On one hand, they do have some great coupons (free meal on your birthday, or 15% off your party's bill during your birth month), but on the other, if I had to pay full price for this meal, I would've been a little miffed.   It's a good stand-in for Mandarin, but doesn't really measure up. PS. ...and NO CHICKEN BALLS!!"}
{"text":"FOOD:  PRO: Better and cheaper than Mandarin Buffet. Variety of food is better here than Mandarin Buffet.  CON: Mostly are fried dishes and the food tastes ordinary to me. Honestly, not worth it to try it again.   AMBIANCE:  Just casual."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the bad reviews.  Every item I tried was good, the selection was decent, decor was nice, and the staff were good.  For such a poorly-reviewed restaurant, they sure had a lot of customers and people waiting to get in. I went on a Friday afternoon and it was packed.  Sure it's no Mandarin but it's still pretty decent."}
{"text":"Has been a very long time since I came here to eat the food is still cold or room temperature the food like it's been there for a long time dried or over cooked the only thing worth getting is the roast beef & dessert that look fresh & good to eat. The rest good luck."}
{"text":"Got one of the 85% off dinner coupons in the mail and decided to try it out. I will note that though I've seen complaints regarding that is cash only, I will state that the coupon says this directly on it. I had no problems with the service, my plates were always taken away in a relatively quick manner, my water glass was always full and the food was fairly good. In comparison to Mandarin, I'd say it's not quite as good, but, its a fair bit cheaper (even without the coupon) and 25 dollars for 2 people to eat buffet with the coupon is absurdly good value. I'll definitely be back at some point."}
{"text":"Since today was Family Day, they did not have the birthday month deal or other coupons available, which was a shame so I took one star off.   As for the food, I don't know why there were so many negative reviews. I personally enjoyed all of the food I tried. Calamari, shrimp tempura, marinated beef, fried rice, hot and sour soup, fresh salad, fried chicken, clams, sushi and so on. For dessert: green tea ice cream, cheesecake, butter tart and more. I was really happy with all the food and had about 5 plates. I'm also not a picky eater.  We had no trouble with the service: they took our plates and bowls when we were done, and emptied our personal plates for shells and waste regularly and gave us water.   I thought they only accepted cash but they take credit too. Overall, our bill before taxes came out to be $112 before tip."}
{"text":"I think the A-OK rating suits this place perfectly.  I came here based upon the cheap birthday special they offered, and it was pretty decent.  Upon entering, we were greeted by an extremely friendly male server who showed us to our seats.  This was probably that last time we actually had any interaction with the staff.    In terms of food, I felt like the selection of food they had their was really sparse.  There was more desserts than actual main courses I felt.  The quality of the food was typical buffet quality, and was often over-seasoned.  My biggest gripe was the sushi looked really old to me.  The rolls were made nicely, but the colour of the salmon was off or something.    Ambiance was pretty nice as well.  Modern lines and warm colours made the buffet feel pretty comfortable and homey.    Overall, for the price, it is a cheaper buffet than others but this can be seen through the selection of food they have.  Despite this, still a good choice if you're looking for a buffet!"}
{"text":"Finally able to hit this place for a weekday lunch and sadly was quite disappointed,    First off, the place overall looks quite dated but the washroom (men only reviewed) was clean enough, had blow driers and just outside the bathroom there is a hand sanitizer if desired.  Waiters were friendly enough and did their part to clean the table of its dishes promptly.  Secondly, the pricing - it is $13.99 for Adults - but they consider a \"child\" to be up to 10yr old.  I have a 10 and 14yr old so we were fine with this, this trip, but Mandarin's version of children is up to 12yr old.  Consider this when coming here v. Mandarin esp during the more expensive time periods.  Also this place offers coupons - buy one adult and get another free.  I believe there was a child version as well - being hit with 3 adults we would have gotten the child for free as well as one adult.  (Max 2 coupons per group; lots of exclusions; Not valid during a Blue Moon yadda yadda).  The coupons are not sent across the GTA - appears to be within Toronto and East of the 404/DVP, but I was able to score one.  Not available online and must pay with cash to use them.  The food?  Overall quite disappointing.  We passed on soup/salad (though I had coleslaw if you can call it that and it was horrible and had super long strands of cabbage).  Note: We don't eat sushi or the fresh fruit - yes it was offered and no we did not have any.  The problem is that there just wasn't enough MEAT being served.  There was a fish dish which we passed on, and they had a couple of dishes with chicken or beef (ie curry chicken; broccoli w/beef (they name it the other way around but trust me - you really had to search for the beef); scallions and beef etc.  The chicken balls were formed chicken and HORRIBLE (I *never* get chicken balls but wanted some meat - and even here they blew up).  The only real meat was the chicken wings and those were not (unlike every other buffet) always available and or replenished with very little.  Either they are not putting out a lot or everyone else saw what I saw and took as many wings as possible.  On the positive side they had (a) good fresh shrimp - deveined and shell free (Mandarin is poor here - they always have the shell on); (b) pan fried shrimp - that was tasty - smaller than the fresh and not deveined and had the shell so a bit of a PITA.  (c) they had a half decent calamari - salty/spicy.  Nice but not all edible - a bunch of hard fried pieces.  And finally (d) actually not bad BBQ Pork - a bit fatty but definitely not \"cold\" or \"hard and dry\" like you can get at Mandarin.  Vegetable fried rice; Young Chow Fried rice (it was okay); shrimp torpedoes (as with Mandarin - lightly breaded - pretty good); kids stuff like fries and onion rings (I saw more onion refills than wings and rarely see a need to refill at Mandarin).  The pizza was poor - only cheese and not very good - kid didn't even want it. They had a couple of dim sum dishes (har gow)  - pretty bad actually.  They had some garlic bread with cheese - clearly they don't wash the tray before adding more - I could see remnants from other iterations.  So what is this thing about the meat?  Well at Mandarin you would have MORE meat in the dishes (noodles; rice etc); but you also have (a) Roasted Chicken; (b) They have a station where you can get grilled chicken or grilled steak - good quality and (c) they have pork spare ribs floating in a sweet sauce (chuckle - not great but they had it).  Note: Roasted chicken *COSTS MONEY* and this place is doing their part to cut costs.  Bad move!  Desserts?  Well this is where the tables are turned - it appears they want to excel with the sweets and they do.  Ice creams are meh, but they have a LOT of good desserts - waffles and crepes freshly made; cheese cakes; various pies, puffs; Neapolitan Squares etc.   But dessert is not something a buffet can do alone to make up for the rest of the experience.  Anyone can get fresh delicious desserts trucked in each day, but to skimp on the meat in the dishes and not provide anything substantial is just not good value.  As a result the first and last time we will come here.  Yes YELPers did have the right rating on this one.  The people at my work said it was pretty good but I passed the first time around and thankfully did.  If you must go, you better not go without a coupon.  Overall, however, if you have a choice - go to Mandarin.  You will have a much better experience at a far better value.  2 Stars because of the excellent desserts but otherwise - AVOID."}
{"text":"I'm here time and time again, because the family just cannot resist a deal! They periodically receive BOGO coupons for Imperial, so we figure, why not?   I call them \"crab legs days\".  On busy nights, the crab leg station is heavily patrolled by hungry patrons, and as soon as the servers drop in a fresh tray....feeding frenzy. The frenzy lasts for less than 2 minutes, and there won't be a leg in sight. I love these legs, they're juicy, NOT too salty, and I've perfected my technique so that I can remove whole pieces with minimal effort.   Over the holiday season, there's oysters and scallops on a half shell, which are perfectly fine. They limit you on the number of these goodies you can take at a time, 2 per plate each time, which is perfectly reasonable. Otherwise, there's always going to be SOMEONE ruining the fun, and running away with 2 dozen oysters and leaving none for others.  Besides the seafood, their sushi station is not too shabby either. Lots of choice, though there's no actual sashimi.  Dessert station is lacking, in the sense that nothing is \"made\" except the crepes and waffles. Everything else seems quite Sara Lee.  All in all, I eat my money's worth in crab legs and seafood, and it's always a good time. I honestly cannot review any of the other food here, because I've never tried it! Nor will I! Why reinvent the wheel?"}
{"text":"OMG this is the worst, food and poor variety!!! What a waste of $89 hard earned dollars.   Even the towelettes stink!!  Avoid the hot crab legs, as they're over cooked and look like flaked crab...the meat wouldn't even come out of the shell!!"}
{"text":"My favorite buffet.  A great selection and fresh and good quality. The desserts are very good too."}
{"text":"Do not come here for regular price, it is not worth it. They often have BOGO deals on their email blast. I came here for one of those occasions and was pleasantly surprised by the food. Don't expect Mandarin freshness or quality but the food is pretty good for greasy Chinese buffet. Buffet sushi is usually poor quality but there were some that tasted pretty good (the eel!).  I wouldn't come here again just because I'm trying to cut down on the buffets and AYCE places, but if you're around the area and starving, give it a try."}
{"text":"I was there for the Father's Day dinner buffet and the experience was terrible! The young lady who was the greeter had a a VERY BAD attitude. The service was very subpar as they were severely understaffed for waiters/waitresses. The kitchen couldn't manage to cook most of the food correctly (a lot was undercooked, overcooked or cold) and they were SLOW at restocking empty food bins. The cookies were so nasty that my kids wouldn't touch them. Flatware at the table was in poor condition and a lot of plates had not been washed properly or were chipped. I could go on! This place really needs to close for good or find new management and get better at quality control and customer service!"}
{"text":"After driving around for about 45 minutes trying to find a lunch buffet on Canada Day weekend that didn't have a huge lineup out the door, we finally settled on Imperial.  Waiters were quick and pleasant enough.   I went for my first plate, which was mostly battered shrimp so I didn't really take note of what else was there.   On my second plate, I went searching for my buffet favorite honey garlic and or bbq spare ribs.  They actually had neither which is a first ever.  Then i went looking for chicken wings and the heating tray was empty, all 3 times I went up.  The general Tao chicken was not general Tao chicken, like not even close.   There was no roast beef/prime rib/turkey station to at least appease me in some manner.   I'm sure everything was jam packed with msg yet still remarkably and seemingly impossibly remained mostly tasteless.  This was by far the worst not only Chinese buffet, but any buffet I have ever been to.   This after noticing the LUNCH price was $17.99 when down the street at a much better buffet (hence the line up)  was $9.99.    To end this stomach churning experience, I decided to fill up on something i knew they couldnt screw up... cookies and cream ice cream.   Well, I was wrong.    There wasnt much left and what was left was a melting almost liquid mess.   So in discussing my rating for this charade of a buffet, I came up with a generous  half a point out of five.   Then I went to pay, took out my debit card only to hear \"we dont take debit\"...which forced me to change my rating to a perfect 0 out of 5.   If you want to see what not to do at a buffet.... by all means go to Imperial.  I wont be back unless I completely lose my memory.    As a footnote, I am NOT expecting a gourmet meal, I'm expecting mass produced Chinese food but this was something far below that.    Some memorable and questionable items to pay double for in the buffet.... french fries, canned corn, pizza slices, onion rings.  So my zero out of five is in terms of someone with minimal buffet expectations.   If you are in any way picky in the least, you will likely rate this place less than a zero.  (Food only, service was good).    Do yourself a flavour..and dont go here as you wont find any flavour whatsoever except maybe the seafood sauce i had to drench my battered shrimp in.     Apparently i have to give it at least 1 star which is an outrage."}
{"text":"Good buffet dinner on weekend: crab legs, scallops, shrimps, and good selection of sushi"}
{"text":"For a Chinese buffet it is okay.  The prices are a bit cheaper then the Manderin but still pricy.  We like it as our kids are not adventurous eaters and they can be satisfied while we are able to get what we want.  The atmosphere is not fancy and feels like a upscale cafeteria. Also the layout is odd....I found myself walking in circles trying to find the room where we were sitting."}
{"text":"I went today for lunch was highly disappointing food was over cooked and bland although are server was friendly and humorous I would not go back"}
{"text":"What happened to this place?!?! It used to be quite good for \"Chinese buffet\" standards.... But I came recently and it seemed that EVERYTHING has deteriorated in quality.  The sushi was hard, crab legs weren't fresh, roast chicken was dry.... Disappointing."}
