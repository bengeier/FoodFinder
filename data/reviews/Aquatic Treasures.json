{"text":"I have a marine fish store much closer to my house(N. LV), but they lack any kind of customer skills and they are $2 more expensive on live rock, $4 more for Spiro, and more expensive for everything I've compared, not even close. Aquatic treasures has a friendly staff, cheaper prices and fish look healthy. I take the extra drive to them every time."}
{"text":"Awesome selection at good prices and a very friendly and knowledgeable staff! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best reef store in Vegas. Not because of size, but because of the owner. Great selection, awesome prices, and the owner is very knowledgeable and will go out of the way to make sure you get what you need. Worth the trip every single time I go. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Always have a fantastic experience, staff very friendly and very knowledgeable about the hobby. They have a great variety of items from anything you might need."}
{"text":"Although this store is quite a drive for me, it's well worth it! I've been to all of the fish stores here in Las Vegas and I believe this one stands out. I've bought a ton of things here including coral, live rock, and fish and so far I have not been disappointed. Their prices are very reasonable. Fish flakes here were about $5 compared to others selling the same for quite a bit more.  Corals are also an exceptional value. Sure they don't have exotics, but a small frag here is priced below the competition.  Everything is very clean and I look forward to coming here every so often."}
{"text":"First time in and i loved it! I usually go to the Tropicana fish store, but this place is really friendly, extremely knowledgeable, and has great prices ..  cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a great customer service I just started going to this place this past week and I can say that this place is very reputable place for reefers ive been a reefer in SF for a long time even the lfs in the bay area cant get close to the help that I got from aquatic treasure I will definitely keep coming to this place for both equipments and live stocks. Every advice they gave me help me to set up a salt water tank for my Dad in a short period of time thanks again"}
{"text":"I met the owner Sunny. He was so helpful in every way possible. He helped me get live stock for my small reef tank at home and also he gave us an amazing deal to put a 225 Gal reef tank in our business.   The staff here will help you with any questions you have and won't make you feel like you shouldn't be asking.   For me so far the best tropical fish/reef store in all of Nevada!"}
{"text":"Got there10 mins after closing but the guys (that just locked the door) insisted to reopen for me and got me what I needed, this place really providesgreat service and care!  They always have high quality live stock and great ecuipment on hand. Along with endless knowledge and the urge to help everyone who steps in the door"}
{"text":"Sonny and crew are great!  Very helpful and knowledgeable.  Favorite LFS."}
{"text":"after visiting the store for the 2nd time there was a huge difference in customer service.  I assume the gentleman I was working with tonight was the owner Sonny.  he was VERY helpful and attentive.  he made great suggestions for the fish I could put in my tank as well as providing me with food choices for my fish.  even his crew at the time of my visit were very nice.    with that said I would only do business when he is there for he is a very pleasant and helpful person to have around.  thanks again Sonny I appreciate your help!!"}
{"text":"While on vacation in LV...checking out the town  we found this place by using Yelp.   Very clean store, healthy stock great selection of fish and frags, equipment and supplies.   We bought some things, including a skimmer I had been looking for.   They offered to hold the stock and they would open early for us to pu...since we had a 7 hrs drive home.  Xav,   was friendly and knowledgeable   We appreciate the help.  Would definitely recommend this place.."}
{"text":"Best aquarium store in vegas. Before starting me reef tank I pretty much went through them all to just ask questions and get advice and to price stuff out. Aquatic treasures was by far the friendliness and most informative. Prices and selection are great too. After talking to as many people and stores as I could I'm glad I chose aquatic treasures as my new fish store. Sonnie and Jackie have been awesome helping me get my tank up and running as well as keeping it healthy."}
{"text":"Very clean small shop, not a lot of coral really good selection if fish and they all looked healthy. Quite a few nice looking anthias. One side is fish and coral other  side of the store is full of products and used and new tanks for sale. There 500g display is pretty sweet ridiculous sized monti in it with some really nice fish. There other displays where also very nice, one which had an awesome looking blotched anthias! Employees where nice only a couple working but thats all that was needed for the size."}
{"text":"Aquatic Treasures and its staff and friendly, knowledgeable, and extremely helpful with their advice and recommendations for sustaining my fish tank.  I was extremely pleased with the great pricing, which is substantially less than other places here in town.  I was very impressed with the time that the owner took with me in helping me select my tank, equipment, and live stock, and will be telling all of friends to start coming to Aquatic Treasures."}
{"text":"What makes the place great is the staff that works here,the availability and willingness to help and answer question which important to those who just starting in this hobby that other store doesnt offer..highly recommended !"}
{"text":"I don't know the young lady name who helped me but she was a lot of help a lot of good information hoping to make a relationship with this store great place to go I recommend Great customer service"}
{"text":"Great place. They have everything you would ever need for your salt water fish tank. Expert staff are ready and willing to help you pick the best fish for your tank. My favorite fish store in vegas. Highly recommended. 5 stars all day."}
{"text":"My favorite local fish store in Las Vegas. My husband often drags me to fish stores all over and this is by far my favorite. It has grown so much compared to a couple years ago. I dislike my husband's hobby a little less everyday when we go here. The prices are fair and Sonny has always been nice."}
{"text":"After searching for a yellow tang this store was my last hope. I went in expecting to be disappointed and left the store eager to go back and do business. The prices were good and my yellow tang (his name is bubbles... Gotta love 'Finding Nemo'.) is doing amazing. He's active and looks extremely healthy! This store deserves the 5 stars I gave it. And I would recommend going here if you're looking for some new fish or some coral. They also had a great selection of fragments to get yourself started."}
{"text":"Definitely my \"go to\" store in Las Vegas. The owner Sonny is usually there to steer you in the right direction and offer expert advice. In the rare case he is out of the shop he has plenty of competent employees around to help out with any questions. Great selection of healthy fish and Corals in a nice clean shop, cant go wrong with Aquatic Treasures!"}
{"text":"By far, the best store in Las Vegas.  The store is clean and the staff is friendly.  They carry a variety of healthy corals and fish.  The owner is extremely helpful."}
{"text":"Bad, Bad, Bad! Where do I start? All sick fish should be the name of this place and all the 5 star reviews here must be fakes or paid for. Every fish I have bought here has died and caused fish I have had for years to die. Good prices on fish is the only good thing. Now I know that a good deal isn't always what it seems! As I left the store I guy followed me out and said that he lived very close and was friends with the owner, but would never buy fish there either and invited me to see his tank.   I would recommend you buy your fish elsewhere"}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could. I called this LFS and told them my Fish died I bought from them a week ago and they told me to bring in a water sample and they would see what they could do. I drove all the way out from Boulder City with the sample and they tested it...water is perfect. Then they said they couldn't do anything since it is past three days which I had already told them. Wasted my time, gas and money to go there. I will never do business there again!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best saltwater fish store in my opinion.  Has great selection and price.  Staffs are always helpful.  Sonny is one of the nicest person you'll ever meet.  The store is very clean and you'll see the staff cleaning the tank all the time.  The store is pretty far from my house but I don't mind the drive because I know I'm getting a good quality fish and coral."}
{"text":"Good prices, friendly and knowledgeable staff!  Decided to get into the saltwater fish and coral hobby and I'm glad we have Aquatic Treasures in Vegas.  Bought my 20gal RedSea max nano tank with reefsaver rock and live sand and water. Came out to about $1000 which is what you would be paying online so the prices are very competitive. Sunny, Toni, and Josh are very knowledgeable and help you with the process of selecting  the right tank for your budget and what you want to accomplish. I.e. Are you doing coral? What type of fish are you into? Setting up and \"cycling\" your tank.   YES, you have to wait about a month and let your tank run before you can put fish and coral in your tank! I have learned hat PATIENCE is key in this hobby!!! Trust me, it's worth it once you see how beautiful your tank can be.   The process of getting into the hobby may feel like a lot to consume at first, but they really helped me with everything and now it is a breeze. If your thinking about getting into saltwater aquariums this is the place to go, I'm glad I did!"}
{"text":"Post is in regards to the service aspect to the store. I didn't have to opportunity to go inside, but don't plan on it anymore. I hired someone to come clean the fish tank, because I wanted to re-start my aquarium and had out-of town family coming in.   I called a week in advance and made sure not to plan anything for that time slot.  Next week comes by and no one showed up.  I waited..... and waited.... and waited.....  Well no one showed up hours after the appointment so I called the store.  They said, He is running late. I said, that was ok and to please have him call/text me when he was on his way. They agreed and we hung up.   Then 1/2 an hour before the store closed and no guy to help with the tank, I decided to call again.  This time the lady gave me his number. I called and no one answered or responded.   I came to the conclusion that the prices may be competitive, but it's not worth it when you end up loosing money for taking off time to sit around the house. Especially when I'm a student and have to save up for family dinner expenses & x-mas gifts.  In the end, no one called to follow up on my experience or if any one showed up and I now have to look for a new tank person. My family has gone back home, so having that on my check-list never got completed."}
{"text":"I would buy anything other than fish at this store. I saw a lot of fish that were unhealthy and dead in the tanks. I believe in buying healthy fish that are properly taken care of. Great selection of everything else though!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff very friendly and have always answered questions I have had about adding fish and corals to my aquarium. Sonny has even hand picked an eel that I was looking for. Highly recommend this store and staff for all your saltwater aquariums needs."}
{"text":"Excellent staff, excellent selection, excellent shop!  Only bad thing is how far away I live otherwise I would hanging out there everyday. I would single one person out but honestly they are all great. Even when I just call them to ask a random silly question they have no problem answering and spending some time explaining something to me.   Seriously. There isn't a better shop in town!"}
{"text":"Best prices in town. Expert knowledge and Sonny won't sell you something you don't need or a fish that you will regret! Amazing that this store has only been open for a few months!"}
{"text":"I should deduct one star because of his wacky \"banker like\" hours but the owner seems nice enough.  Prices seem fair and I like the setup.  My local shops are far better but  it's a pleasant place to visit if you've got the reef itch."}
{"text":"Love this place even though we didn't buy the aquarium yet. Sunny the owner is very friendly and accommodating, explained pros and cons of different aquariums, lighting, skimmers, etc. He really spent time and he's not rushing us. They have a lot of fishes, corals and stones.. The best part, he wasn't pressuring you of buying... For all reef lovers, you need to check this store out.. Drove 25 minutes from our house and didn't regret it... it's worth a drive.. Good customer service! Definitely coming back here..."}
{"text":"By far, the best store in Las Vegas.   The store is clean and the staff is friendly.   They carry a variety of very nice and healthy coral and fish.   The owner is extremely helpful and willing to stand and walk you through any hobby issues you may have.  Highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"I am impressed with the store. I've been here before maybe a year ago and there was renovations going on. This was my first time back in the store and this store has come a long way. They had a HUGE selection of corals and frags. They had an extensive selection of Red Sea products too which I thought was great because a most of the other LFS in Vegas just carry the basics and that's it. The store is still small but it packs a big punch!  I will definitely be going back for more"}
{"text":"The only lfs that carries everything you need for a reef tank. Sonny really knows what reefers want and need. I only go here cuz he only stocks the top name brands of food, supplements,  & equipment.  Like Rod's,  LRS, Red Sea, BRS, & Brightwell to name a few. I don't have to order online and his prices are spot on so you actually save on shipping. Serious reefers that have invested alot on fish and corals know what I'm talking about!"}
{"text":"First time here today. Friendly and knowledgeable staff with good customer service. Excellent coral selection. Fair prices. I scored a really nice mushroom rock, a zoa frag, snails and a Scarlet Reef Crab all for a sweet price. Gratitude to Xavier. I will be back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hands down the very best store in Vegas. Sonny and his staff always go above and beyond and have very fair prices.  I live at least 30 minutes away and drive past other shops to go here, but it is well worth the time.  As others have said he always post what's coming in on the FB group and literally responds to question immediately no matter what time of day or night."}
{"text":"This is one of the better tropical fish stores I've been to in Las Vegas. The staff was very knowledgable and polite. They have a decent variety of livestock at hard to beat prices."}
{"text":"Excellent Reef Store. I had a great experience here, and the owner, Sonny, is one of the nicest guys in the business. I bought 1 Acan colony and a frogspawn with 4 heads. I also got 3 frags, Acan, digi, and hammer.  Tons of SPS frags, beautiful display tank. Corals are all kept under high end lighting so you are getting frags and colonies that are well taken care of.  You can tell they know what they are doing. Prices are competitive and they will price match. Very fair, honest, and they take care of the customer.  Highly recommend this reef store."}
{"text":"They helped us a lot starting our salt water tank; step by step information. The staff are very formative and helpful. I would not go anywhere else but this place. Pricing are also reasonable compare to the other stores across town. This is definitely my to go place !"}
