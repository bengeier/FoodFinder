{"text":"Went for a NYE dinner and loved it! Ambiance & Decor was warm and inviting. The staff was A+, very knowledgeable & attentive. The prices were steep, (with a steak being 50+ w/o a side) but the food is worth the cost, especially the succulent beef & lobster mac n cheese! Desserts was a slight disappointment (creame brûlée) but the food and the fine wait staff more than made up for it. I will come here again. Lovely place!"}
{"text":"Food - steaks were just ok. Not nearly the best I've ever eaten.  Other stuff was great. Creamed corn was excellent. Dessert was fantastic but way too large. Could make half the size at half the price as a matter of fact we all only ate less than half of the desserts.   Service - our waitress was great. The rest of the service was just ok. Couple slip ups with the steaks being cooked right.   Wouldn't make a special visit.   Reminded me of a Cheesecake Factory Steak House, but much more expensive."}
{"text":"Just went to EM for the second time after anticipating it for months and had another delicious meal - chose the bison tenderloin and could have cut it with my fork it was so incredibly tender and had delicious flavor - perfectly seasoned so nothing overpowering.  My friend had the braised beef short ribs and loved her meal as well, tender and nicely combined with roast veg and garlic mashed.  Both enjoyed the Merlot iceberg salad with good toppings and dressing.  Server attentive, pleasant, helpful making suggestions and also allowed us plenty of time to gab and catch up without pressure to order.  Look forward to the next time - definitely a special occasion place since it is pricey.  Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"When you are someone with food sensitivities it is hard to find a restaurant that has understanding servers and chef- and Eddie Merlot's is one of them- have been there multiple times and always feel comfortable there- was there last Thursday night and the halibut was wonderful- I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and food.  We hit the bar early while we waited on the dining room to open for dinner. The bar service was excellent with the bartender making some unique suggestions for drinks.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Huge menu and the people were SOOO nice but the food was just so-so.  Steaks were ok, not great and lobster kind of mushy.  Tuna tartare appetizer was the only stand out for me.   Large seafood selection for a steak place, which is why we picked it, but not worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Favorite steak house. The service was great. Variety of options on the menu. The carrot cake is Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Friday night, events downtown, if they couldn't handle an influx and prepare edible dishes; they should have reconsidered operation hours. The kitchen ran out of mashed potatoes. Probably, only happened one other time in the history of the world. Really pushed the hurriedly boiled macaroni with some spare lobster. At the current purchasing levels, pork chops should not have been scarce. I believe, the annoyed waiter, became embarrassed of what he had to serve."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for lunch and had a great time! We had a reservation and were seated immediately at a nice, large round table.  It was my first time dining here and I thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience. The environment is bright, open, and well decorated. The service was excellent and very accommodating.   We started off by sharing the shrimp flatbread, which our server recommended and it was quite tasty! I also ordered a cup of the lobster bisque, which was amazing, full of flavor and actually had substantial lobster meat. Next, I opted out of ordering the burger that caught my eye, as the soup was more filling than I expected, and went on a lighter route with the Southwest Chicken Caesar salad. The salad was okay, but nothing spectacular.  The ingredients were fresh, but were completely drowning in the dressing.  Next time, I will be sure to order it on the side- or go with the burger instead.  It was a bit pricey for lunch, especially for a sub par salad, but I am looking forward to give it another try!"}
{"text":"Our party of four dined here last night after spotting it on an earlier visit to Pittsburgh. Delicious! Our dinner selections-Caesar salad, wedge salad, and French onion soup were quick and very tasty! The bread for the table was hot and yummy. Dinner was a ribeye, mixed grill, filet and the trio of medallions. No one was disappointed-everything was cooked spot on. Even with a dining room that filled and a couple special event parties arriving during our dinner, we were FULL and out in time for the football game. Thanks for an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 53rd anniversary last evening at Eddie Merlot's and everything was wonderful.  Our servers (Cameron and David) couldn't have been any better - they were both personal, caring and very attentive.  The manager (Larry) even helped us to our parking spot!  We were a little hesitant about driving to Pittsburgh for dinner but directions were easy, validated parking was a perk, and eating at this restaurant was definitely worth it!  I can't say enough about the taste and quality of the food.  We both had the \"summer grill\" for $89 for two - had the 7oz filet mignon, salad and veg.  They kindly gave us a complimentary drink before dinner and an amazing dessert after dinner.  Thanks to everyone at \"E\" for helping us celebrate 53 wonderful years.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  Starting with the easy in and out from the Ft. Pitt Bridge into the underground garage where the parking is validated and you never have to venture outside.  The location has been difficult for the prior restaurants in this space, as it is just off the downtown grid and not too convenient for those on foot. Valet parking is also right outside, but the indoor parking is very much easier.  Don't let the light crowds these days deter you.  The fare is excellent as is the service.  Ambiance is as good as it gets.  Comfortable for a meeting or for a romantic evening dinner.   The ambiance is far superior.  Conversations are easily heard at the table as the acoustics are excellent.  Overall, the menu and the food is superior to Cap Grille or Morton's.  The bar serves strong generously poured cocktails.  Go."}
{"text":"Couldnt have asked for a better experience. Cindy, our server, and manager Tom took care of us and made the night very special. Everything was great, service and food. Thanks again for everything- we will be back."}
{"text":"Nice location and nice view of outside. Has an open feel to it. Though it was busy on a week night, didn't feel crowded. Excellent service ! From the lady at the reception to servers. Food was good too. Caesar salad was ok. Salmon was made to perfection. Good choice of desert (creme br, carrot cake).  They validate your parking if you park in the gateway garage.   I would say among the top steak houses in downtown. 4 stars overall. Gave 5 for the service on top!"}
{"text":"The only vegetarian entree, which was a gnocchi at $26, included a choice of either a caesar salad or a wedge salad with bacon and egg, neither of which was vegetarian. We had them substitute it with a beet salad and they said that it would be an up-charge of $2. My wagyu burger came medium to well, not medium rare as ordered.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We don't often go out for steak dinners but Eddie Merlots might change that. Delightful service and excellent food. The filet trio verges on obscene. In a good way. Beef stroganoff is delicate and delicious."}
{"text":"I loved there lobster Mac n cheese by far my favorite the steak was good too not the best tho kinda plain and dry for the price I just expected more"}
{"text":"The Short: - Steak was decent, but expensive at that price point (3 of 5) - Ambience was okay, tries to be fancy but isn't (3 of 5) - Service was inattentive, uncoordinated and slow the price point. (2 of 5)  The Long: We came to the steakhouse after the baseball game around 10pm, and were told that the kitchen was still opened. We ordered the crab cakes, two steaks cooked medium rare and a few beers.   The crab cakes came out within 20 minutes, which was decent timing but we were waiting for the steaks for over an hour. What made it worse was the continual barrage from our host that the steaks \"would be coming momentarily\".   We ordered a second round of beers and saw them sitting on the counter for around ten minutes before someone bothered to bring them over. We were considering grabbing them ourselves.  The steaks were okay. Nothing special. To sweeten the deal our server told us that the sauces would be on the house, but when the bill came they had charged us for it. They took it off but the whole experience was rather poor.  My advice? Try another place to get your steak fix."}
{"text":"Great food,great service.i recommend the steak trio and banans foster.I usually go to ruths chris steakhouse but decided to switch it up and was very satisified with my decision.It was expensive but well worth it"}
{"text":"Hands down! One of our most memorable dining experiences in Pittsburgh! We came here to celebrate a family event. Our waiter was so friendly and attentive. The dining tables have just enough space between them so it gives a great dining-out vibe while at the same time does not prevent having intimate conversations within one table. I loved that! I feel like this is an important aspect which a lot of restaurants are missing.  We ordered four different salads and all were great. For our entree we ordered beef steaks (different cuts) and the buffalo. All were juicy and tasty (we ordered medium rare and they came out just right). For desserts we had the chocolate and carrot cake. I felt the carrot cake was a little too sweet though. Also, we wanted to get espresso, but they said the machine is broken which I find a lame excuse for a restaurant like this (cannot they just buy one for reserve? I am sure Eddie Merlot can afford this) . But it did not matter that night since we had a great experience dining here, both food and service wise."}
{"text":"My girlfriend suggested this place for our pre theater meal. Fantastic Service & Fantastic Food! We sat at the bar and had a glass of wine before our meal the bartenders were Super nice and friendly. Off to a good start. Our waiter was very knowledgable and gave us the rundown of the specials and his recommendations. We started of with the filet pot stickers. The size was perfect and they were really flavorful. So picking the appetizer was easy but now comes the hard part deciding on an entrée. So we decided on the Louisiana sampler which came with a 7oz filet andouille sausage mashed potatoes and choice of soup and salad . Since they do not offer a side salad the waiter was kind enough to have the kitchen split the wedge salad for us. My friend ordered a side of Brussels sprouts and I was agonizing between the truffle parmesan fries or the lobster mashed potatoes . Now for anyone who follows my reviews has to know I haven't met a fry I didn't like lol. Soooooo I went with the fries. I'm definitely gonna try those mashed potatoes next time. My filet was cooked perfectly it sliced like butta! The fries we're seasoned to perfection. Yes I know we ordered a mound of food needless to say we had tons of leftovers. The side dishes at the place are meant to be shared. So we're both stuffed and our waiter offered us the dessert menu I readily replied Bring It!! Lol they have tons of treats to pick from and I decided on the peanut butter pie. I took one bite and was like YASSSSS !!!! The peanut butter filling was silky smooth not overly sweet. Just the right amount of crust and chocolate. So needless to say this place is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal and the staff the most courteous and helpful from the time that we set foot in the door to when we left. I must say to anyone who has ever though about coming to this establishment,  \"This place is AMAZING!!!! Bring the family, friends or significant other. you are sure to be impressed!!!\""}
{"text":"Probably the best steak I have had in PGH. (simple Medium .07oz Filet Mignon - no sauce).  I ate here on a Wednesday evening around 7PM. We made reservations but there were several empty tables.   Our Menu: -Filet Mignon -New Orleans Mixed Grill* (4 oz. filet mignon, grilled shrimp, Andouille sausage, roasted garlic mashed potatoes) -Asparagus -Eddie's Potatoes (Diced potato, jalapeño accent, cheese, au gratin) -Lobster Mac & Cheese  Each of the sides could be split three ways if you get a little smorgasbord like we did. They were absolutely amazing. I've definitely eaten comparable sides at weddings/events but I haven't been to a restaurant in PGH that hits the mark so well with all the cheesy goodness that you want in Mac&Cheese and au gratin potatoes.   Personally, I wouldn't get the New Orleans Mixed Grill because after you eat the steak, that's all you really want to eat. You dont want to fuss around with any other meats.   We skipped dessert and actually apps as well because we knew the food was going to be so good.   Only callout is the price - I totally get why the prices are high but it's just not a place that I could go to regularly and not have my bank account yell at me. Highly recommend it though!   -You're able to take leftover food home -Parking in the garage below the restaurant gets validated -They have a coat check"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my wife as she had recently gone there with friends and wanted to repeat, and I love aged, prime, steaks.  Our waiter, David H., could have been better...very attentive and guided us through the selection process with honest interpretations to match our tastes.  We were very happy with his advice and our choices.  We shared several appetizers: oysters, fried calamari, and tempura shrimp.  Presentation was excellent and all of these dishes would be repeats in their own right.  My only suggestion is that there is overlap in the tempura aspect on both the calamari and shrimp, so if you are looking for two distinct tastes you may find these too similar...I would get one or the other.  The Caesar salad my wife had was very good. Portion size was ample for hungry diners. They have a nice cocktail menu, decent wine list which we ordered some glasses from, and a reasonably priced corkage policy so I could bring a bottle from my cellar.  For main dishes I had the 16 oz. prime strip, and my wife had the 7 oz. prime filet mignon.  The steaks are aged for 21 days which certainly tenderizes them and I could tell that the strip was indeed prime from the marbled fat content, but I did not detect any aged flavors that one might get at any of the Palm restaurants if you order their 18 oz. prime strip.  I had the hash browns (very flavorful), and my wife had the truffle parmesan fries which were also very tasty, both were generous portions.  For dessert we shared the strawberry shortcake which was excellent, as was the French press coffee.  I would rate this steakhouse concept as excellent and on par with Hyde Park in Pittsburgh.  For comparisons with DC it is certainly better than Ray's the Steaks, and not quite as good as the Palm.  Again, the service was first rate and as good as the best steakhouses I've ever eaten at...thanks to David H., and we will be back."}
{"text":"Very nice place, 1st time there and we weren't disappointed... Food was great and so was the staff.."}
{"text":"Abysmal. Service began well then dropped off a cliff. Food was bland to tasteless. The food that was actually cooked, that is. Prices are a joke. Managers? Absent. Shame, shame, shame. Why is this place still in business? There are far, far better choices so choose wisely people."}
{"text":"We were attending a concert at Heinz Hall in Pittsburgh and needed to find a place to eat before the show. We ate there on a Monday evening around 5pm. Reserving a table on opentable was quick. We ran a little bit late --- person answering the phone was friendly, and happy to change the time.  First, the restaurant itself is large, spacious, huge windows, and gorgeous. Exactly what I would expect from a nice steakhouse. They spread the tables out but still manage to serve 300 simultaneously. This is a nice change from a Ruth's Chris, or from Morton's where they pack you in considerably tighter.  We started with drinks, both Ketel One Martini's and mixed cocktails suggested by the waitress. They had a few interesting ones, and they were all very tasty. This might be a great after work place to grab some apps and drinks, albeit an expensive place.  We started with the Alaskan King Crab legs and Barbeque bacon-wrapped Shrimp. The legs were conveniently cut in half and ready to eat -- no fussing around with them like at a Joe's Crab Shack. The barbeque shrimp were large and delicious...great sauce, and everything is better with bacon!@#  The steaks were the main reason we came here. Both steaks were succulent, full flavored, and very nicely seasoned. Like most steakhouses we've been to, our Medium+ orders came out closer to Med Rare, and were simply not cooked perfectly. Both the waitress and manager came around to check on us (a few times, actually) and offered to send them back. We were hungry, somewhat pressed for time, and the cook wasn't so far off to be worthy of much fuss. We would have been happier sending them back, but hindsight is usually 20/20.  The desserts were both delicious -- one was a molten chocolate lava cake type thing, and the other was a HUGE, and I mean HUGE piece of carrot cake. Or was it a whole cake? This thing was probably 5 x 5 x 8 inches. A serious hunk of cake. It was delicious, but after all the food, way too much.  Overall, I really liked Eddie Merlot's. Yes, the cook on the steak could have been better, but they offered to rectify that. Most of the food was delicious with careful attention to detail. This was our first time dining here, and it was exactly what I'd hope it would be.  The service was friendly, prompt, courteous, and not at all stiff like we've experienced at other similar places. The recommendations on drinks and appetizers was spot-on. I think we even received a thank you card from the server for dining with them.  Let there be no mistake about this: this place is a top-notch  The 30oz (!!!) $99 Wagyu Tomahawk Ribeye is calling my name. I didn't order it because I didn't want to have to be rolled to the concert, but one day I will order that. It sounds huge, awesome, and that over-the-top dish that you simply can't get anywhere else in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Way overpriced and very limited wine list.  Design of the front bar is very economical with limited selection of spirits, service was average and food was ok, not great.  Dinner for 3 was $900 with tip and no dessert.  Place to be seen but sadly not a great dining experience.  Seafood appetizer had 6 oysters, six shrimp, and 3 split crab legs  - disappointing for the price. I will not return but you will see me back at Capital Grille."}
{"text":"DOWNTOWN DATE NIGHT: GREAT FOR A PRE-CONCERT MEAL  Hi All!  Came to Eddie Merlot's with \"Dr.Oxford\" for dinner before a concert. The waitstaff was pretty snappy once we were seated and alerted them of our concert time.   Great wine list, had several California vineyards I liked. Sooo I started drinking on a empty stomach! Big mistake! Progressively flushed and felt  warm and fuzzy as we sat and talked. It only got more warm and fuzzy as the night went on!  Since we didn't have time to linger, I ordered Sea Bass and \"Oxford\" ordered Veal. I also had an cold crab and wasabi salad = fabulous!   I would come back and try..steak! lol  Love you! Muah"}
{"text":"*Business Lunch Meeting Recommendation*  We had a group of 8 to do a sales meeting over lunch, and chose this location to book a private room. I would absolutely host here again in the future. Here's why:  ROOM: Perfect size for 8, maybe even 10 or 12. Hidden in the back corner, quiet and quaint. Had a Samsung TV mounted on the wall and multiple input options (see pic) for presenting.   ENVIRONMENT: Restaurant is classy and impressive. Location is ideal in downtown. Bathrooms have customized hand towels and mouthwash. Steak knives are monogrammed with their brand name. It's little touches like this that show they care about their patrons.   STAFF: Patrick was the best (request him!) He found the perfect balance of being there when we needed him, but also letting us continue business without interrupting. Very attentive and polite.   FOOD: Lunch menu options were great. Lighter fares like salads and sandwiches, but also a few full entrees and steaks. The lobster bisque was my favorite. Also, have them bring fresh whipped cream for your coffee, it was so much better than milk or creamer!"}
{"text":"We had a company Christmas Party there.    Each meal was prepared with attention to details.   Filet was tender and cooked perfectly.  Salmon was juicy and has a nice char.  Pork chop with peaches are the envy of other dinners.  Creamed spinach converted non-spinach eater.  Carrot Cake was fresh and not too sweet.  I did not have the creme brulee but I saw scraping from other diners.  Emily was the head waitstaff of our party... service was efficient and on point.   She was friendly and attentive.   Kim was the banquet manager and she came to our party several times to make sure the event is going smooth.  Tom Mielo the manager is hospitable, professional and very hard working.  We were pampered at Eddie Merlot.  Aside from the great food ... the service was outstanding.   What a staff, what great employee culture !!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best steakhouse I have ever been too nationwide! The staff and food are just phenomenal! Try the lobster mac and cheese and the carrot cake!  Also, Love the iPad menus!"}
{"text":"This place was an over priced disaster. $90 steak and they couldn't get the doneness right on 3 tries. They poured us a second bottle of wine without asking. The beets on the roasted beet salad tasted canned.   In many years of travel this is by far the worst steak house we've ever visited. The only winner was the waiter. Do yourself a favor STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the steakhouse group in Pittsburgh. Very modern interior and by far the best steak in the group. Very creative presentation on the traditional shrimp cocktail, called the smoking shrimp cocktail! Service was excellent! Walk past Ruth's and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Exceptional service.  Being that I am a complete carnivore my lovely wife took me to Eddie Merlot's as a surprise for my birthday. I had never been before so I was very excited. As soon as she gave her name I was not only greeted with a Happy Birthday from the hostess and manager but, a few of the servers actually sang me Happy Birthday. Once they finished we were shown to our table. I was never in this space when it was Palomino's but, it is a very lovely space as Eddie Merlot's  A few seconds later our waiter came and went over the features of the evening. After we had made our selections he brought us some delicious bread to start with. For beverages we all had the lemonade. It was very good and quite refreshing coming in from the summer heat.  For my entree I chose the 16oz Prime Ribeye Steak topped with Bacon Gorgonzola Cheese paired with a Sautéed Crab Cake and Lobster Macaroni and Cheese for my side. My steak was just plain remarkable! It was very tender and juicy and cooked to perfection. The Bacon Gorgonzola Cheese was the perfect addition to the steak as it added a unique flavor to the meal. The Lobster Macaroni and Cheese was exceptional as well. Full of lobster and filled with different types of cheeses.   My wife started off with a Caesar salad which she absolutely loved. For her entree she chose the New Orleans Mixed Grill. It features a 4 oz. Filet Mignon, grilled shrimp, Andouille sausage and roasted garlic mashed potatoes. Our daughter got the Filet Mignon topped with steak butter with garlic mashed potatoes as a side. She devoured everything on her plate so I think she was pleased.  After we were finished with our meals our waiter packed the rest of our food to go and even packed us a fresh full loaf of bread to enjoy with it. he also gave us each a Eddie Merlot piece of chocolate that was delicious.   My only two complaints are one like others have said is that I wish the food was served a bit warmer as the AC was on Antarctica so after 15 to 20 minutes our food was getting cold and two it would have been nice to of been offered a birthday dessert or something which I wasn't which to me is strange. Otherwise our waiter has very good the entire evening.   Eddie Merlot's is a chain steak house just like Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Hype Park and Capital Grill but they defiantly bring something different and unique to the Pittsburgh Steakhouse Fine Dining Scene.   Insider Tip: Be sure to park in the garage in the building where Eddie Merlot's is located as they will validate your parking ticket."}
{"text":"Great service. I'd suggest asking for Tera for your server!  Not to be unfair from any others but wow was she impressive with service. I travel a lot on business and get to frequent many high end restaurants. She was up there with the best of the best from my experiences. Food is great, atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"This place never loses its charm on me. The service is amazing, the food is out of this world, and the atmosphere is very comfortable. If you want to really spend alot of money on quality food. This place is for you."}
{"text":"I have been to Eddie Merlot's twice for lunch, with differing experiences.  The first time I went was shortly after they opened this location, with an older male colleague, and the service was fantastic.  I had a burger, which was fine but nothing special.    Yesterday I visited with several female colleagues (and I myself am female).  The service was subpar, particularly in light of the price point.  My glass sat empty for quite awhile, even through we were in a highly visible area and the waiter walked past us frequently.  We did not receive bread, though tables of male businessmen received bread (that looked fabulous).  Our food took quite a long time to come out.  Eventually someone who appeared to be a manager came over and said that one of the dishes had had to be recooked because it was overdone (my thought: does that mean that my dish was sitting under the heat lamp all that time?).  While I am not one the one who picked up the bill, I don't believe anything was done to compensate for the extended lunch.  Bread wasn't even offered (the manager left so swiftly I didn't have a chance to ask for it).  I had the meatloaf.  It was good, but didn't knock my socks off. It was served with mashed potatoes, which were bland and lacked any wow factor. I lovea  good mashed potato, and they're not hard to make, so this is not impressive.  The green beans with the dish were well done.  The meatloaf left a strong aftertaste that lasted until bedtime that evening, so I would not recommend it on a date!  Overall, I am not sure what to think.  I hate to think that we were treated differently as a table of all women, but when I experienced much better service when with a male colleague and the tables around us did not experience similar service issues.  This leaves me reluctant to suggest Eddie Merlot's in the future, though I will go if someone else picks it."}
{"text":"UPDATE TO PRIOR REVIEW! We revisited the Eddie Merlot's Pittsburgh location. All we can say is WOW!!!! A\"night & day\" experience!  All food was presented, executed and served on point. Temperature was hot when it should be - Lobster bisque steaming hot, flavorful with correct expected consistency. Did not appear to be \"held over\". Each and every menu selection we made did not disappoint. The cauliflower au gratin was savory and full of cheese. The meat was cooked to precisely our requested doneness.  And the attentive graciousness of GM Larry Stakes' interaction with us and his interest in honest feedback was genuine!   We say - JOB WELL DONE LARRY & your wait and bar staff at raising the bar, paying attention to feedback and details! Keep up the good work in a continuance in both fine food and service at your location! A complete pleasure to write this 5 star update!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible for large parties!   We gathered all together to celebrate one of my best friends birthdays and from start to finish the night turned into a debacle. We initially had 2 waiters that took the drink order and the leading gentlemen made a presentation regarding the different beef's the restaurant had to offer. Shortly after that, the female server went around the table and took the dinner/appetizer orders and it went all down hill from there. She began on the right side of the table then stopped mid way through, for an unknown reason, and resumed on the opposite side. Which at first it didn't seem like an issue until 2hrs later she comes back to the table and advises that the kitchen got the dinner order \"wet\" and the ink bled all over the slip and no one's order was placed so she had to go back around and take the dinner order again.     After the food started to arrive about 30 to 45 minutes after that, multiple orders had missing items. For example a guest ordered the crab stuffed shrimp and the mac n cheese but their mac and cheese was missing, also there was 2 salads that were given to the wrong guest. In addition I ordered a barry white that sat empty for one hour before anyone on the wait staff offered my another. At this hour the entire party is exhausted and almost immediately everyone ask for boxes to take their food home. The male waiter proceded to take each plate and return each bag to members of the party by throwing it on the floor and under the table cloth, the female waiter returns and placed each bag on top of the table. Which caused some confusion as to what happened that the male waiter would think that some of the guests food deserved to be thrown under the table and disregarded. After that a guest presents a cake to the birthday guest and the male waiter asks if he would like it cut and plated, the birthday guest responds by saying yes and can you only cut 7 slices. The waiter returns with approximately 6 more servers who cut the entire cake and served it to the entire party which was 12. The night ends everyone settles their balances and leaves. Not one person apologized for \"loosing/forgetting\" the dinner order, the amount of time we were there or the level of service we received.      I can not express how truly upset I feel knowing the Eddie Merlot standard from previous visits to the experience on Friday night and on top of it all it was my best friends birthday. There needs to be a apology of some sort issued either to the party or to the birthday guest for the night we had. If this is any example of how larger parties are treated I will no longer suggest going to Eddie Merlot's to celebrate."}
{"text":"Went here with a group for dinner last night. I ordered a bourbon ribeye steak and it was very good! I also ordered a creme brûlée for dessert and it was delicious!  Most of the group's dishes were very tasty, but I noticed that the portion sizes were very small. It's s good thing we had bread beforehand (which was good, by the way), or else I probably would have left hungry.  The server was very polite and we liked him. We also had an excellent bartender who was very knowledgable and paid attention to detail. Overall, a nice meal and a good experience, however the dinner took 2-3 hours which, in my opinion, took way too long! By the time we were done eating, it was bedtime because the food took forever to come out!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  The trio of shrimp, andouille sausage and filet mignon with mashed potatoes was tasty.  The blackened scallops were spicy and juicy.  The chopped salad was huge.  The crab bisque was creamy and delicious.  The restaurant was busy and our waiter had a lot of tables to wait on.  I think they were short staffed because our dirty dishes were not picked up for awhile and we never did get offered any bread.  I wish I would have gotten the creme brûlée because the cinnamon roll with ice cream was not the best.  The cinnamon roll was on the dry side and not fresh.    The atmosphere is nice with plenty of space in between the booths.  The restaurant was noisy though."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Definitely at the top of the list of Pittsburgh Steak Houses."}
{"text":"There was a hair in the Meat Loaf.  Pretty sure it was not in the recipe.  My wife had a very good steak dinner, Filet - perfectly prepared and a 5 star experience.  I ordered the mixed grill and my daughter ordered the prime meatloaf.  Stick to steaks and get a five star meal."}
{"text":"Good location.  Multiple options for various cuts. I found the cocktail offerings to be uninspired for a prime retail outlet, hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Eddie Merlot's is our \"go to\" restaurant!  We always enjoy our visits and have never been disappointed!  We use the word \"visit\" because that's exactly what it feels like ... going to a friend's beautiful home for a lovely evening of delicious food and great wine, along with enjoyable conversations with their excellent staff.  It's a good location for any of the theater venues in Downtown Pittsburgh.  The underground parking garage is very convenient and they have validated free parking after 5:00pm.  Their Platinum Club is well worth joining!"}
{"text":"Service absolutely on point. Food is solid, but not incredibly adventurous - understandable as steak is steak."}
{"text":"The quality of the meat was excellent. And the service was very good. For that I would give them 4 stars. But the ratio price/quality is not there. I found it to be way overpriced. A New York strip of 12oz. for 45 dollars (and then you have to add $10 for mashed potatoes or a broccoli side) is way too much for me. Location was very nice but not enough to justify those prices. I would pass."}
{"text":"For an after work spot or a steak and seafood night out, Eddie Merlot's is as good an option as any. High quality meat, incredible preparation, decedent desserts, and flavorful appetizers / sides. Large wine list, friendly service, and upbeat atmosphere in the heart of the business district round out the positives. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Simply outstanding! First time there and if I get a chance I will return. Had the 7oz filet that you could cut with a fork. Sweet potato casserole was possibly the best I've ever had and they make a mean old fashion. By far one of the best steakhouses I've visited"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. The service is incredible, food is delicious, and the drinks are fantastic. One of our meals was requested without mushrooms, and a minute after bringing the food out someone from the kitchen came out with additional gnocchi to make up for the lack of mushrooms - never even heard of such thoughtful service before."}
{"text":"Not sure how I felt about the whole experience.  On the one hand, the appetizers and drinks were excellent in size, quality, and value.  On the other, my main entree was a subpar cut filet that was both bland and bad in texture.  The staff is great here, and they seated us promptly.  Even with our large sized group, the staff was able to keep up with drinks and keeping the table clear.  They took our orders quickly, and there were no issues once the food (entrees and apps) came out.  Like I said, it was just the quality of my filet that left me wondering if I was really at Merlot's or if I was at Ponderosa Steakhouse.  Would I go back?  Sure!  I'd give them another try."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! Just finished eating the BEST meal of our first trip to Pittsburgh. The staff was fabulous from the time we checked in with the hosts to our waiter Tera with the great helpers. The oysters were so fresh and delicious. We asked for horseradish for the cocktail sauce. It was fresh and trimmed in the back. I had never had it in this preparation and it made the sauce. My husband inhaled the pork chops and I had the steak. The wedge salad was the best we've ever had. The spinach salad was great. Cannot say enough good things. We were in town for the US Open so had not come prepared for a dressy night. Even though he was in shorts and flip flops as was I, they made us feel comfortable and welcome. Please give this one a try."}
{"text":"This review is for their Mother's Day brunch buffet.  I love love love their brunch. I'm so glad that I made reservations, although it was last minute, I was able to get a table for 4! Unlike other places where you practically have to book weeks in advance!  I'm not sure if the brunch buffet is regularly occurring or if it's only for special occasions like Mother's Day. Anyway, the food was delicious and very good quality! They have a breakfast section, lunch, salad, seafood, carving station, omelette station, dessert with bananas fosters station!   What I loved about this place is that it's quiet and more intimate than other brunch buffets. Don't get me wrong, EM was busy, just not crazy!! You're not bumping elbows with people.  Overall I really love this place. Seats are the most comfiest restaurant seats I've ever sat in!! I'll be back.  By the way, my parents were very impressed with EM. Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"My review is probably affected by the fact I had a super hot date the night I dined here, but this is arguably my favorite dining experience in Pittsburgh and one of the best steaks I've ever had. I ordered the medallion trio and ohmylanta the bacon Gorgonzola was ridiculously good with the oscar style being excellent as well. Portions were rather large for the price in my opinion. Asparagus was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend was happy with his meal choices as well, especially the bacon wrapped shrimp for an appetizer. Did not get any dessert as I was already stuffed but they looked yummy as they walked by. Our server was wonderful and very accommodating. The decor was meh but I didn't go there to eat drapes and wall sconces , nomsayin?"}
{"text":"My family wanted to show us a great time in Pittsburgh after Christmas and they brought us to Eddie Merlot. I Our first impression was not great as the valets ignored us while they watched a fight that had broken out across the street at in front of McDonald's. Our waiter was too familiar in how he addressed us and he did not fix things that were clearly subpar---e.g., my Manhattan cocktail that was brought to me half full, sans cherries, even though I had asked for extra cherries. We all made comments about it and he ignored us and, throughout the meal, we had to flag down another server to have an issue addressed, such as extra salad dressing. Many steaks had to be sent back for being improperly cooked and my ribeye, the only steak I ever order, was ok and not well marbled. The sides were good.  For the price of this meal I expected much better quality food and much more attentive and professional service. This was NOT value for money. 2.3 stars is the accurate rating so I rounded down."}
{"text":"I stopped by here before the Steeler playoff game.  The hostess was pleasant and took us to our table right away.  The interior has a good look.  Crisp and clean.  I ordered the ribeye steak, parmesan truffles, Brussel sprouts, and added a crab cake for good measure.  I got the Buttercup for desert.  The steak was juicy and tender.  Did it live up to the hype?  I would say it fell a little short, but there was nothing to complain about.  I always love Brussel sprouts, until I had these.  They were soggy and did not have much flavor.  I was expecting Brussel sprouts plus bacon to put this meal over the top, but it too fell short.  The Parmesan Truffles were tasty, but seemed like they sat for a bit.  They were not hot like I like them.  The crab cake was just bad...tasted like it came out of a box and then microwaved. It may be the worst crab cake I ever had.   The Buttercup was tasty and had lots of peanut butter flavor.  I would like to try it again.  The beer list was disappointing.  No beers on draft and limited selection (no IPAs)."}
{"text":"From the beginning until the end of our meal the service was outstanding. The waiter was very helpful & vetted in finding things we liked as well as helping us pair amazing drinks with our even more amazing steaks. One of the best steak I've had across the country."}
{"text":"What a perfect night.  Started at the bar with a Blueberry mojito & Eddie's Paradise Infusion. Both very very good.  I always love a good mojito!  Tried the Beef Carpaccio. It was very good except there was too much of some type of sauce (kind of like mayo tasting) under the beef.  I even got my husband to finally try escargot (Bourguignon).  And he loved it!  I knew he would.  Was even dipping the fresh bread into the garlic butter.  We each had the 7 oz filet (cooked to perfection). Mine topped with truffle butter & his w/ bacon gorgonzola cheese.  He also added a bbq bacon wrapped shrimp. Delicious to say the least.  And added the Eddie's potatoes...has a nice mild taste of jalapeno's.  Topped it off w/ creme brulee.  Once again....perfect.  Have to add that our server Armind (sp?) was absolutely wonderful especially with his lovely accent."}
{"text":"Walking from our hotel to Eddie's  our excitement grew as we peeked through the big windows. The interior looked so cozy and elegant. We were seated right away and were actually pleasantly surprised at the size of the place. My husband wanted a corner table and hostess had no problem seating us according to our preference. I started out with the beet salad,which was ok but very pretty, the beets could of been more roasted. We then moved on to the oysters which were delicious and perfect. My husband also ordered the baked garlic shrimp as one of our appetizers and he claims it was delicious. I tried a little bit of the stuffing since I don't like shrimp and it was perfectly garlicky. For my entrè I decided to splurge and go for the Wylarah Filet Mignon cooked medium plus, and when they brought it out I was a little disappointed at the size, but that's fine dining for you right? However it was a delicious piece of steak! The flavour was perfect and even though I ordered sauce I didn't even end up dipping the steak because the flavour of the beef was delish on its own.  As our sides we ordered asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower. I was not too crazy about the cauliflower, but the Brussel sprouts were very very good and I would highly recommend them.  The dessert for two caught our eye, even though we were full, because they prepare it in front of you. We chose the brownie. It was pretty cool how she lit the cognac. The brownie came with raspberries and toasted pecans ( which were delicious ) and topped off with ice cream and hot fudge.Thumbs up for the dessert.  If you want to impress your lady this place is definitely a perfect place to go on a date. Overall I feel like it's just a little bit overpriced on some of the meats. But definitely well worth to check out. Good flavour and great service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect. This is the same location as the old Palomino, and I loved that place, so I was a bit skeptical... Was staying across the street so we walked over on a Friday night right when they opened. Greeted by 2 very friendly gentlemen and taken to our table, a nice big round booth. I think we had the best waiter ever... His name was Don. Super attitude, funny, attentive and a great voice!!! Food was to die for. Best oysters I've ever tasted (clean-no grit). I had the bison filet, delish. Husband had NY strip, perfectly cooked. We had several apps including the steak tartar... This was also wonderful. The wine was good. The cocktails were good. We made the mistake of ordering carrot cake that could have fed 6 people!!! We ended up giving 3/4 to friends of ours who were having dinner at the next table. Although the name of this place is not as widely known as Cap Grille, Mortons or Ruth's, it far surpasses all of them in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Thanks josh for fantastic service and meeting Our groups dietary needs! Enjoyed the seabass I had tonight and really liked the Brussel sprouts as well. The outdoor patio was great and the food came out fresh and looking great. I'll definitely be back, especially after a great walk at point state park!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch there with some colleagues.  Decor is quite splendid--very airy and not gaudy.  Noise level is excellent so you can carry on a conversation without echoes or fighting house music. The menu is not overly ambitious and had something for everyone, including some staples like French onion soup, lobster bisque, and creme brûlée.  The short rib meatloaf, Black & Blue flatbread, and BBQ shrimp (huge) were all excellent.  My Crab Louie was just OK.  Everyone enjoyed the peanut butter cup with the only complaint being that they couldn't finish it! Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Food and service there is amazing!  We went there for our 3rd wedding anniversary and were blown away by the attentiveness of our waiter Cameron had for us.  He served us complimentary champagne and crème brulé.  Hubby had the French onion soup (best soup we have ever had) and the bone in filet with baked potato and broccoli(shareable btw) and I had the Cesar salad pork chops and it came with mashed potatoes we also shared the peanut butter cup.  Everything was mmm mmm good!"}
{"text":"This review has many parts. The atmosphere, the service, the food and the price. 1. The atmosphere: Initially, I liked it. I'd been there when the space was 2 other restaurants and they did well in changing the space. However, as though she was sitting at my table, a woman two tables away could be heard chatting as though she was sitting next to me. She wasn't yelling, but the acoustics were such that we heard the entire conversation all night! A little weird. 2. The service:  I have three parts to this one. Our server, David was very nice. He was funny and helpful. However, part two...there were two managers the night we were there and neither came up to see how things were. I feel that at a restaurant such as this, that would be a common activity. Third...toward the end of the evening, there were other wait staff readying tables for the next day. They were chatting about someone-hoping that person would get whatever it was s/he needed. And they were quite boisterous about this. They continued this conversation as though we were no longer there. Not at all what I would expect. 3. The food was wonderful. From the salad to the sides the dessert and the entrees. Exceptional! The portions were generous and we had dinner for the next night as well. The wine list was wonderful and the two selections we made were stellar!! Thanks to David for helping with that too! 4. The price-well, we have been to all of the higher-end steak restaurants in Pittsburgh and elsewhere. We were a little surprised at the prices here. They were higher than the others and didn't need to be. There were others offerings that some of the others don't always have. But, the prices seemed just too far out of reach. (Examples...chopped salad $14, filet mignon, petite $59.95 as I recall.) The dessert was the deal of the night at only $9.95 for an enormous piece of cake that was very delicious. I have to say-glad I experienced, but I don't need to run back. I didn't get the vibe I get from Capital Grille, Hyde Park or even Ruth's Chris. It just wasn't as warm and inviting as some of the others."}
{"text":"We had a large group dinner for 50 people at Eddie Merlot's.  A group banquet like this is often hit or miss - even for the finest of restaurants, but Eddie Merlot's brushed off the challenge like lint on a suit jacket.  First of all, we were seated in a private room that looked like it could hold up to 75 people and featured floor to ceiling windows.  It is a beautiful setting that accentuates the restaurant's location in downtown Pittsburgh and gave us plenty of comfort to browse around the room and talk with each other.  The room featured 5 top round tables with comfy chairs.  Our appetizers were served buffet style with shrimp cocktail the size of my index finger and an awesome cheese board.  My only complaint was that their cocktail sauce was little more than ketchup.  A steakhouse - let alone an expensive steakhouse - choosing to serve a large group is a disaster in the making, but I was amazed with the quality in presentation that they were able to achieve.  As expected, the alternate entrees were great, but the magic was in the steaks.  Every steak came out well plated, at the right level of doneness, and served hot.  Side dishes were served family style.    The meal was capped off with an amazing caramel and sea salt chocolate cupcake.  Please consider Eddie Merlot's for your next large group event - it may be expensive, but your peeps will love you for it and that is worth any cost."}
{"text":"My girls and I had the most fabulous time for our dinner Friday Jan 26st. We had a super late dinner get together due to different scheduling conflicts. Reservation was made for 10pm. Our waiter, Jim provided suggestions that you could literally taste as he described. We ordered martinis and Moscow mules that were quenching. Appetizers were the Spinach Artichoke dip and Jim also brought us a complimentary Crabcake to try. (Quick side note, I lived in MD for 7 years and I had to admit, they did the Maryland crabcake justice! It was super meaty, very Lil breading, and seasoned superbly! It was my fav of the night!) All four of us ordered Salads, which was ok but not worth $9.95. The bacon dressing was phenomenal though! My friends ordered the Seabass, King Crab, and scallops ....... which were AMAZING!!!! I personally had the Mixed Grill which included filet, andouille sausage and grilled shrimp, all spiced and rubbed with love lol. It was insane! No one ordered desserts as we didn't want to eat sweets before a night of drinking but we were all pleased with our experience. Monday, Jan 29, to my surprise I received a postcard from the waiter advising how he enjoyed our visit and to keep them in mind for Valentine's Day. I was so impressed I told my husband I definitely wanted to go back and get that crabcake again! Lol Eddie Merlot's is a fantastic venue! I 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"It's okay, but I was disappointed.  The service was excellent - attentive, but not stuffy or too high-brow.  Our server read us well, and opened up a bit, and was very helpful in the process.  The environment is open and loud.  There were many large tables, and these bigger groups were loud.  Fine, but not what I expected.  It was hard to chat with my lovely wife at times.  The food was good, but lacked a real edge to get me excited.  Here are some notes:  - My New York Strip was cooked as I requested, but was on the thin side, had a  big strip of untrimmed fat (which a NY Strip should not have), and lacked surface texture.  I do not think they seasoned this cut much, if any.  - Their featured jalapeño potato side-dish was blah.  No bite at all from the peppers, and just potatoes, which are bland without spices.  There is some cheese in there, but Hyde Park's Gruyere Potatoes would crush this dish, as would Capital Grill's au gratin potato dish.  - The Creamed Spinach was excellent - not soupy, like some do, and not overcooked to a mush.  Very good here.  - My wife's Ribeye was also good, not great, again, seeming to lack much surface texture and seasoning.  - The Key Lime Pie is very good, properly tart, and not artificially colored (thank you).  - Their coffee is excellent, served in a French press.  So overall, I was let down.  In this area, I enjoy Hyde Park Grille much better, and would put Capital Grille ahead as well.  If you have been to a Flemings or Ruth's Chris, I prefer them Eddie Merlot's as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work for appetizers and drinks for happy hour, the cocktails were fairly strong, which I appreciate, and a good price during happy hour--although during regular hours it looks like they're the most expensive cocktails of all of the fine dining restaurants downtown. I expect pricy drinks downtown, but not New York City pricy. Anyway, when it came time to order my friend flagged down the bartender, I couldn't quite hear what the bartender was saying (his lips were moving, I thought that maybe he was introducing himself or giving any additional specials) so I leaned toward him and said \"I'm sorry, what?\" He replied by flailing his hands and yelling \"you have to go, go, go!\" Listen, I served in several fine dining and some not so fine-very high volume restaurants and no matter how busy we were, I would never have said that to a customer. Not ever. It wasn't even much of a rush, in the entire restaurant if he can't handle the little burst of people that came in then he should be thankful that he never worked at Harris Grill during bacon night, my god.   Anyway, I ordered a large plate of beef carpaccio to share with everyone and it was...interesting, I mean it was good, don't get me wrong but it was definitely different. It had your typical thinly sliced raw beef (although thicker than most places) with capers, balsamic, and olive oil, but there was a truffle aioli on it that seemed more like store (well, sysco) bought mayo with truffle oil whisked in---which, yeah, is poor man's aioli, but not what you'd expect from a place trying to pass as fine dining. It was served with house fried potato chips, which I assumed was meant for you to but the beef on and eat in one bite, it was different, but it tasted good, then again after two cocktails pretty much anything tastes good, I just didn't get that wonderful classic, fresh flavor from it like I'm accustomed to with carpaccio.   Super long review short, the food was pretentious in it's quest to be inventive, it was pretty overpriced for what it was and the bartender was a douche, plain and simple. I will admit that I overtipped and I always do because I know that servers pretty much assume you're an asshole and don't consider that maybe they just sucked when you don't put at least 20%. I won't go back, I'll probably try and talk my coworkers into going somewhere else for our next happy hour, give it another year or two and Eddie Merlot's will go the direction of Palomino which stood in that spot before it."}
{"text":"One of my go to spots for business lunch or dinner!  Excellent staff and some of the best food in the city.  You can't go wrong with their lobster bisque and the steaks???  Forget about it!  If you haven't yet been, you should do something about that.  If you have, well you already know."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything negative about my visit to Eddie Merlot's!  I travel to Pittsburgh for work, fairly often and this was my first time visiting this location.  I booked a reservation thru Open Table, and was greeted (and seated), immediately upon arrival.  My server, Rihanna, was awesome, very attentive without hovering.   I received a loaf of the herb bread, with butter and proceeded to order the Short Rib meatloaf, garlic mashed potatoes, accompanied by a wedge salad.  The salad arrived a short time later, nice portion, freshly prepared and topped with bleu cheese dressing.  The entree arrived shortly after finishing the salad.  The meatloaf was super tender, and seasoned nicely.  I could actually see lots of shredded short rib, throughout the beef mixture.  The portion was more than adequate, couldn't quite finish it all (I tried!).  The mashed potatoes, were rich and tasty, as well.  I did opt for dessert (to-go).  I was not as impressed with dessert, as I was with dinner.  The portion was HUGE, enough for 3-4 people to share.  The cake was just ok, reminded me more of spice/fruit cake than carrot carrot.  Texture was very firm.  I received 2 large, 4 layer slices and ate approx 1/2 of 1 slice.  Overall the food and service was stellar!  I will ABSOLUTELY return to Eddie Merlot's."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! It was my first time dining here and I will definitely return....their drinks were tasty, app salads were super fresh and my steak was cooked perfectly. In addition the atmosphere was beautiful and the service was superb!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and service. HIGHLY recommend for a special evening. Best views of all the steak houses in Pittsburgh. Staff very accommodating. The curved booths are nice for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday date, and it was perfect. The beef carpaccio was amazing! Don't pass it up. The tuna wontons were also delicious, as was the Gorgonzola salad. We split the ribeye and the filet. Both my boyfriend and I preferred the filet -- juicy and melted in your mouth. Cocktails and atmosphere were perfect, I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Stopped here when other restaurants were full. Had a super Ceaser salad (huge) with anchovies, and trout amandine with haricots verts for only $30!  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"My experience here is from a work reception, so I can't fully review the restaurant.  However, I can at least warn anyone else looking to have a reception here.    The reserved private \"Board Room\", which seemed more like a glass closet, was not ready for us when we arrived at our reservation time.  It still took a good 30 minutes to an hour after letting us into the room for them to finish setting up and bring the hors d'oeuvres out.  Several of my coworkers had to change their drink orders repeatedly because the restaurant didn't have the tools or ingredients to make it, or didn't have the alcohol.  Most of the hors d'oeuvres were not gluten-free, but luckily I had requested beforehand that at least one gluten-free option be provided.  This ended up being shrimp cocktail and a fruit and cheese plate, so not too bad, although my stomach wasn't feeling too hot afterwards.  There were also skewers of meat, grilled onions, and peppers.  I tried one, and the meat was so bad I couldn't even cut it with the steak knives we had to request specifically for that purpose.  I understand wanting to use up the less than stellar stuff in things like skewers, but that was just bad.  My coworker's piece was hardly cooked at all, and he couldn't eat it.  Not too promising for what is supposed to be a steak place.  I can't say I'll ever come here again."}
{"text":"My first visit wasn't so great because my steak was some what fatty but the dessert was awesome.  However, my first visit was when they just opened so  I tried it a second time and it was much better.  I definitely recommend this place for a business dinner or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Excellent crabcakes and Iceberg salad render this a passable steakhouse. But the steak frites was truly horrid.  We also had at least five different servers in one evening."}
{"text":"After browsing at the Art's Fest, we decided to walk over and have a drink and appetizer at Eddie Merlot's. We were so excited to sit at the bar and experience this new restaurant in Pittsburgh. We sat at the bar while three bartenders stood around conversing amongst themselves, looked over at us and then looked away! We sat there for at least another minute or so while continuing to be ignored when we finally called a bartender over to take our drink order. She never asked if we wanted menus so another bartender gave them to us after we asked. We ordered the calamari, which was tempura battered, fried and greasy. Needless to say it was not good. I ordered a moscow mule and it wasn't served in a copper mug...disappointing. The whole experience didn't end quickly enough and suffice it to say, we will not be going back. I have owned a business for 10 years and I would never think to treat my clients like we were treated. The whole atmosphere left a lot to be desired. With the many wonderful restaurants to choose from in Pittsburgh, one would think the \"new kid on the block\" would be trying a little harder to attract a clientele, not turn them off."}
{"text":"Chose Eddie Merlot for a close friend's 30th birthday dinner because he has always loved dining here. It was my first time here so I was really excited as well.   We had about 15 people so they put us in a nice private party room. The service was awesome - from the moment we walked in to the very end when we left. The food was so good! My boyfriend and I had lobster bisque, sweet & spicy rock shrimp, and crab cakes for appetizers. The shrimp was my fave! So good. For entree, the bf ordered the new york strip along with mashed potatoes & creamed spinach (we shared this) and it was perfectly cooked. We're some pretty hard critics when it comes to our steaks but I'm gonna admit -- Eddie Merlot definitely met our expectations and we were so pleased.   Some of my friends ordered the sea bass, others had the filet mignon bone-in, which they all loved as well.   Wish we had room for desserts but we were stuffed by the time we finished our plates! But there's always next time :-) bf starting to love dining here so I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Alright Pittsburgh, another new, great restaurant for our fair city. Dined here twice so far so I think I can write a fair and informed review and I expect I will be here many more times to come. Eddie Merlot's is a, very good and lovely to look at, Steakhouse and more. High on looks, high on service, high on price, high on the palate. Worth it all, when you want to splurge.  So far I have had the pleasure to enjoy the 22 oz Prime Bone-in Ribeye Steak and the 18oz Prime Dry-aged New York Strip Steak. Both steaks were delicious and very highly representative of the best of their cuts. Perfectly cooked to medium rare and with such moistness and flavor. Have had the East coast and West Coast Oysters on the half. They were very fresh, flavorful and nicely presented. A word to the shucker, only one issues was a little too much chipped shell included done at shucking time.   Starting also with soup and salad, I tried the Merlot's wedge and then the Chopped Salad. Both were outstanding, but watch for the Chopped Salad containing: Crisp lettuce, Gruyère cheese, red onion, celery, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, crispy prosciutto, and seasoned almonds, with creamy herb dressing, to be very large and filling. A companion liked the French Onion soup enough to order it on two visits. All the sides we tried were pretty good, mostly everything is a la carte so you pick em as you like and have room for. One surprise though and an outstanding one at that, was not listed on the menu but my Strip came with fries. I am not sure how they cooked them but these fries were really good I have to say.   Service is courteous, efficient and informed. For only being in operation a month or two now, I see no real bugs in the orchestration of the complexity that is high end service.   The hosts station was very efficient and we were seated within minutes of our reservations. I really like that efficiency and management skill in a top restaurant because that is part of what you are paying for and you get it here. There is paid Valet parking out on the Liberty St. side and complimentary, validated  parking in the underground garage.   There is a great looking bar area/section where folks are drinking, mingling and eating. I have not tried that side but it certainly looks inviting and beautiful.  As I said at the start, alright Pittsburgh, we have another great new restaurant in our great city. Thanks Eddie Merlot for coming our way."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburg for work, so a group (9) of us went there for dinner around 7:30 on a Friday night. We did not have reservations, we waited 5 min so they could some tBles together. I ordered the berry white drink, it was amazing!! For dinner I could not make up my mind, I wanted to order the trio of steak but decided on getting the 3 coarse dinner instead. I got the mushroom flatbread as an appetizer, salmon for dinner and the Apple pie bread pudding for dessert. The salmon was amazing!!!! I took two bites of the dessert and had to take the rest home, it was even great warmed up!!"}
{"text":"Was excited for the opening as I didn't have the best experience at Ruth Chris. We went on a Tuesday night so we were seated quickly. The lounge area was nice and comfortable and it had a very business like atmosphere. The service was outstanding. The gentlemen knew his stuff and was attentive. He is the main reason I gave three stars. When he was occupied, other staff members would check on us to make sure out drinks were given in a timely manner.   My wife and I ordered and split the best ribeye on the menu (the most expensive version). It was an ok steak but was room temperature after the third bite and cold half way through.   The Alaskan king crab was outstanding.   The complementary bread they serve is kind of a joke.  I would have expected more (better quality and taste) with the amount of money we dropped.   The lobster bisque was $10 and probably the best value. It wasn't any better then other places but I can see why it was only ten as they aren't very generous with the lobster part but again a good value.   The shrimp wrapped in bacon was the worst value. I received 5 pieces of shrimp wrapped in bacon and drenched in BBQ sauce. $19. I couldn't taste the shrimp and barely the bacon. The BBQ overpowers the taste and it tasted like generic BBQ sauce you buy at the store. I would avoid this as tasty as it sounds.   All and all the above, with some drinks and tip ran us about $250. Not sure I would go back unless it was on someone else's tab."}
{"text":"Eddie Merlot's is a classic upscale steakhouse with a few unusual twists. The restaurant is huge and extremely attractive, having been completely remodeled after the failure of several predecessors in the space. The menu is pretty much what you'd expect from such a place, but it also includes unusual items such as sinfully high priced steaks and rarely seen classics like Steak Diane. Someone high up in the chain of command apparently has a streak of pyromania, because in addition to the Steak Diane there is at least one other entre and multiple deserts that are prepared with flames at table side. The wine list is good, not great, with prices in the expected range (i.e. high). Service was satisfactory last night, but the restaurant was empty due to the cold weather, so there wasn't much of a challenge. We ordered the Steak Diane for two and shared the special cheesy potatoes and, believe it or not, the creamed corn, which is not the same as your mother served(e.g. jalapeños are involved). Continuing the flame theme, we shared the bananas foster for desert. The wine was a decent Malbec. All of the food was excellent. Prices, as you would expect, are at the special occasion level, so our return visits will be well spaced."}
{"text":"We love going to Eddie Merlots! We always ask for Tera. They used to valet right outside which was the best.. I guess they had an issue and had to shut down the valet service, bummer! The ambiance is so nice and the service is always top notch. We usually get the barbecue wrapped shrimp, wardolf salad, filet, and bananas foster. We occasionally get king crab legs when we're in the mood."}
{"text":"Flawless all around. Our waitress Kelly was pleasant, and funny. The wine selection on the iPad is really fun and extremely insightful for someone like me who isn't a big wine drinker. My fiancé and I started out with the steak pot stickers and they were very good. The both of us were extremely happy with our suggested wine selection from the iPad. My fiance got lobster bisque and said there were huge chunks of lobster and the soup was overall perfect.   Since I couldn't convince my lady to split the 30 ounce Waygu with me I opted for the 10 oz filet. THE BEST STEAK I HAVE EVER EATEN. Bar none. We split \"eddie's potatoes\" which are cheesy and delicious. My fiancé ordered the filet medallions which come 1 peppercorn (very peppery) 1 bacon gorgonzola , and 1 oscar style. Aside from the peppercorn sauce being a little overbearing, she enjoyed the dish very much  I chose the Peanut Butter Cup dessert, and like the rest of the meal, it didn't disappoint. The presentation was very nice as well.   The ONLY negative to all of this is the price. It certainly won't be a weekly visit for us, but definitely will now be considered any time we want to go somewhere nice for an occasion or when we refer friends to a place to eat in the city."}
{"text":"I dined at Eddie Merlot's for my birthday dinner last night and was happy with the meal and service, but I was not blown away for the price we paid.   Our waiter was friendly, went over the menu with us, and brought our drinks promptly. He did, however, bring me the wrong wine, but happily switched it out for the right one.   We ordered the tomato & mozzarella salad, the wedge salad and the chopped salad. None of them were seasoned well. The tomato and mozz salad also looked like I made it in my kitchen in 10 seconds. The wedge was apparently worth it, though. So far, not impressed too much, especially considering how amazing Ruth's Chris and Capital Grill salads are.  As for the steaks, mine was good but not great. I got the 10 oz filet mignon cooked medium rare (it was actually more on the rare side), but I ate it all. It was a high quality cut of beef, just not seasoned well at all. I'm actually not sure if it had salt on it because I ended up salting it myself. It was also pretty cold by the time it got to the table.   My husband enjoyed the Wagyu Tomahawk steak. He said the flavor was incredible and got it at the recommended medium temperature to help melt the fat. This cut is very tender, but the menu boasts it is 28 oz. It is mostly bone and didn't have much meat at all. He said it wasn't quite worth the price for the amount of meat he got. He is going to stick to regular ribeyes from now on.  The desserts were excellent. The table shared the s'mores, which was a giant s'mores tart and the Peanut Butter cup, which was like a peanut butter cheesecake. I also received a free Red Velvet Cupcake because it was my birthday. I let my family share that due to food allergies and they all loved it.  At the end of the night, the bill was over $550 for four of us. It definitely wasn't worth this price, but I still enjoyed myself because of the atmosphere and decent enough food. I likely won't be back, though.  Food Allergy Update: Eddie Merlot's will take care of any and all food allergies. Since the food is fresh and made to order, they can accommodate quite a bit. I did not get sick and give this place an A+ for attentiveness in that regard."}
{"text":"I was in town with my fiance and ran into one of the waiters about town. He suggested we come by for dinner and WOW was he right. I looked it up on the web and saw a photo of the carrot cake, I know its a steak place but this looked so good.  I had a prime rib of bison oscar (lump crab meat on top) with a baked potato. It was out of this world. My fiance had filet mignon oscar and said it was delicious.  Then came the carrot cake...it did not disappoint! I took it home and had it for the next 3 days. This is a definite place to add to a list of spots to eat."}
{"text":"Service was way to slow and it took them 25 minutes to seat us when they said its not busy on the phone earlier.  Our total dinner time was more than 4 hours and eventually we were just tired of the wait time. Food was decent and for some reason our cabernet \"raymond\" was ice cold (which made mo sense)."}
{"text":"Eddie Merlot is a new restaurant downtown near the Gateway station. I work in that building and was lucky to be a guest at their grand opening. My review is for that grand opening and not a typical sit down dinner.  Eddie Merlot put out a wonderful spread of food ranging from seafood, cheeses, desserts, breads, and meats including beef and pork. I'm a big seafood fan, so I decided to stick mainly to the seafood options. The shrimp cocktail was HUGE and fresh and the cocktail sauce had a nice quick to it. The calamari was tender and perfectly fried (not drenched in oil). The ahi tuna wontons were equally delicious. The lobster bisque was creamy and rich and had small chunks of lobster meat.  I definitely left feeling like I would come back for lunch and/or dinner.  The only downside of the experience is that I'm not a fan of the decor. I personally find it to be too busy. But it's a new brand restaurant, large, open and clean."}
{"text":"Great night out at Eddie's had a nice seafood Cajun dish steak was amazing. The shrimp and the sausage was a tad dry but still pretty good. Atmosphere is nice little slow for a Friday night but I think the Penguins playoffs might've had something to do with that."}
{"text":"Went to Eddie Merlots in Downtown Pittsburgh. 4 of us in total. It was my first time here, but I've been to other similar places in Pittsburgh(Hyde Park, Capital Grill, Ruth's Chris, etc.) and this was right up there with the best.   The service was great. Quick, knowledgeable, and super friendly.   The food was also great. I got the 7 oz fillet and I added it to be \"Oscar style\" which was great because I am a big crab fan. It also had the sauce and a few pieces of asparagus. We had some sides of mashed potatoes and cauliflower. The prices were what was to be expected. 2 other got the fillets which were all cooked to perfection. 1 person got the cedar plank salmon and it looked delicious. It was a nice size piece also.   The drinks were stiff but great.   We had some cake and crème brulee for desert and everyone enjoyed it. I am sure I will be back at some point. Hopefully sooner rather than later. It was a great night out on a Wednesday."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!   I rarely give 5 stars. Onion soup supreme Spinach soup and dumplings were to die for  Bread awesome. Gin drink was superb.  Both David's were courteous and responsive.  Even Dominique the manager asked about my experience"}
{"text":"We often bring clients to Eddie Merlot's for business lunch meetings and to entertain them. The experience has been nothing short of best in class. Our clients always enjoy the fine dining environment and the exceptional customer service. Eddie Merlot's is also a great place to bring you significant other!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a business lunch. Have been here multiple times and have experienced great service with each visit. The food is fantastic as well with lots of daily specials that are impressive."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience - beautiful location, superb staff interaction, everyone is treated like a celebrity - By Far one of the Best Steaks I have ate! The best Calamari, The best Mac Lobster Cheese! I'm the common person who likes to eat out every now and then with his wife so we have tried other locations in the same 4 Star rating and by Far the Best food in the  category - their Calamari was perfectly cooked tender, no grease, light! It was better than all the Restaurants who signature is Seafood! The price was a bit more and we did take a little leftovers home but pound for pound it was worth it! The combinations of excellent dishes! Why only a 4 .... Cause I had a lobster tail that I allowed to sit and probably my fault tastes a bit drier than what I expected but OUR MEAL pound for pound was the best! We'll find ways to shave the bill but we'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and have never been disappointed! Yes, it is pricey but you absolutely get the quality you pay for here. Treat yourself! I've had a variety of apps, including their shrimp, oysters, beef carpaccio, and beef tartare. There are not many places I would trust to serve raw options, but I was very impressed! I am a stickler for the prep of my meat. If I order a steak medium rare, I want to see that red meat! The steaks are always cooked exactly as ordered.  The last time I went was my first experience of lunch and I was pleased. Kay was our server and I honestly can't remember the last time I had a server as great as her! She was polite, funny and extremely attentive to our table of 2 despite having to serve a huge table next to us as well! Quality of service can really make or break a meal for me and Kay was so wonderful!  If the dinner menu is too financially intimidating for you, their prices are very reasonable for lunch. I believe my burger was around $16 and was served with parmesan truffle fries. That price is not much more than you'd be charged somewhere more casual with typical bar fare and believe me... it's worth the few extra bucks!"}
{"text":"Was in town for work and wandered into this place off of the street. Phenomenal and friendly service, matched only by their food. I highly recommend the salmon, and have never had more delicious garlic mashed potatoes. The atmosphere was also a nice blend of upscale yet laid back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate dinner at Eddie Merlot's for Valentine's Day. The aha tartare was delicious, the lobster bisque had some meat, the short ribs were tender, the sea scallops were good, the crab cakes had too much bread in them and not enough meat, the filet mignons were cooked to our liking, and the asparagus was cooked and seasoned well. The waiter was nice. When our entrees were brought out, we were asked if we needed anything else. We asked for salt and pepper. 15 minutes later, we still did not have our salt and pepper, so we had to ask a second time."}
{"text":"My husbands ribeye was average...tough couldn't cut it with a steak knife!!  And this is a steak house!  My salmon was fine...the avocado lobster salad was amazing though.  The lobster mashed potatoes were were so salty they were lousy!  The service was good until the end and then I felt rushed..I was still eating dessert and she was taking the plate away!  And do try the peanut butter pie it was out of this world!  Ordered coffee that was full of grinds!  She left the bill but asked if we were ready before I even had a chance to look it over!  I expect so much more for this kind of restaurant!  It will be awhile before we venture back!"}
{"text":"I had purchased gift certificates from here and couldn't wait to use it with the bonus gift cards. My husband and I decided to make a date night out of it. We started with these giant tiger shrimps with bbq sauce, which were delicious. It was amazing the shrimp wasn't chewy given the size of it. Then they rolled the cart up with our wagyu tomahawk and cut it right in front of us. I do wish I had a puppy to feed the bone to.  Most of the seats in the restaurant are next to these tall windows, so it makes it great for people watching."}
{"text":"Mother's Day brunch was amazing. Everything was too of the line. Delicious lamb chops, steak, crab legs, shrimp scampi, breakfast and bananas foster. Worth every penny. Kept it fresh and stocked."}
{"text":"Business lunch with clients on a tight schedule.   Slow service.....decent food.  2nd time we experienced slow service at lunch.    Can't comment on dinner service, will not be going back for lunch."}
{"text":"I attended a luncheon here and the food was spectacular. I had filet mignon and cheesecake. Both of these were so delicious! I will likely dine here again, but it will be for a business lunch and not a dinner with my family."}
{"text":"The steak was good but the soup was even better. The service was top notch and the bread was delicious. I had a ribeye and while it was good, it wasn't great.  I expected a better flavor from a top end steak house."}
{"text":"I came here for a Sunday birthday dinner with my aunt and uncle. Drinks were fine, food was enjoyable but didn't inspire any lasting memories. Service was...odd.  We got seated promptly, though we had a reservation for 3 and the table was only set for 2. The restaurant was nearly empty. Beautiful space.  Food: I ordered the 12oz New York Strip, which was very good. I ordered it medium and it came out a little more like a medium well - I didn't find it that disappointing, but I was a little surprised, at the price. My companions ordered a bison steak, cooked medium (seemed more of a medium rare) and the stroganoff, which she commented came out basically cold. We also ordered garlic potatoes, mushrooms, and asparagus for the table. The asparagus was almost too tough to eat. The other dishes were good. We were celebrating my birthday, so a waiter brought me a creme brûlée with a candle - no complaints there!  Service: \"Strange\" is the only word I can use to describe it.   By the end of our experience, 5 people had waited on us in some regard. One of them was very nice but spent probably 10 full minutes making conversation with our table. (Other waitstaff were squeezing behind him because he would not move? And he instructed our primary waiter to refill a drink we hadn't requested be refilled?) When our food came out, there were 3 people there to get everything served. (All I could think was \"please, just put the food on the table at let us serve ourselves!) One of them dripped gravy on my uncle's shirt and didn't seem to think anything of it - just gave a mellow \"whoops, did I get you? Just trying to turn this plate the right way.\"   Other restaurant employees were trying to set up some tables behind us and one kept falling...one waiter brought us a specials menu and commented something like, \"I haven't actually read it, ha-ha, but I encourage you to take a look.\"   It was just kind of a weird atmosphere and I sensed everyone at the table felt a little uncomfortable with each new development.   Long story short, there are far better and less-expensive places in Pittsburgh for a memorable, high-quality dinner experience. I don't recommend Eddie Merlot's if you want your party to be comfortable and confident they'll receive a stellar meal at a fair price. I get the impression they're trying really hard to live up to their prices. They shouldn't have to."}
{"text":"Eddie Merlot's seems to be going downhill. This visit was actually my third over the past year. My first experience in the fall of 2017 was for Happy Hour and my friends and I ordered dinner from the Happy Hour menu. Our server was friendly and efficient and our food was good. My second experience was Easter Brunch in 2018. I was looking forward to the lamb that was advertised. Although I like my lamb medium rare, the lamb served on the buffet was extremely rare and not very flavorful. The remainder of the buffet was adequate, but nothing super special. Our service was excellent.   My visit this past week is why I started this review with disappointment. The worst part of the visit was the condition of the restroom. The Ladies Room stunk of urine. Two of the stalls were out of service. The next one I looked in had no toilet paper. Finally I found a stall with toilet paper. There was towel litter strewn across the sink area. It did not appear that anyone had been in to clean the place in quite awhile. All the trash cans were overflowing. The smell was the worst, though. Our servers behind the bar (it was Happy Hour again) were quite rude. There was a lot of confusion over the bill. I wasn't drinking, so I observed what was happening to my friends with a sober eye.   I will be quite hesitant to return based on this last visit. The extremely poor condition of the women's restroom speaks volumes as to the management of the place, in my opinion. I gave three stars because of my past visits, but based on this last experience it would have been a 0."}
{"text":"My fiance had dinner at Eddie's about 2 1/2 years ago when he was a Sr. Business Analyst for a top company downtown with his colleagues. He raved about how wonderful the food was and the portion size, so I decided to make reservations for my fiance and I for a date night at Eddie Merlot's for February 18 at 8:15. First, walking into the restaurant I thought the decor was okay was not too thrill with the seating. Did not like the chairs (something you would see in a law office's waiting room or a conference room). Our waiter she came over to take our drink ordered I had the Blueberry Mojito and my fiance had Bourbon. The drinks were great! The bread was good, a little on the crunchy side, but that was okay. I wanted the rack of lamb, but they was out of it, so I went with the 12 oz. NY Strip Steak and my fiance had the Trio our sides was Eddie's potatoes, sweet potato casserole, and cream spinach. We both wanted our steaks medium well, but we ended up with medium well at the beginning and the rest was medium rare (very red ). All the sides were very good! Our waiter she did the basic nothing above average. I asked for napkins because myself and fiance do not like using those cloth napkins, she gave me a strange look and said ok I never got the napkins. She never asked if our steaks were cooked to our liking. She did not tell us about any specials or made any suggestions on something to try. Another waiter he told us about a good dessert to try and he was very polite and nice. I hope our waiter did not do this because of our skin color (people always think that black folks do not tip well). She would have got 18% of the total of our check ($35.00), but my fiance gave her $20 for the lack of service. For this to be an upscale restaurant they did not have any bags to put our leftovers (waiter let us know when asked for a bag) us and a few other patrons had to walk out with four or more boxes (us six boxes) of food in our hands, trying not to drop them. The overall experience was okay, would I recommend, probably not and I would never go back again. I had better service at Eat n Park and they always have bags!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. After a great experience  during restaurant week ,my husband and I came back  for our anniversary. Our service  was slow, the waiter was no help in recommending anything on the menu, just said \"everything is good and it is my favorite menu.\" When we finally got the chance to place our order, the table beside us spilled a drink so he stopped taking our order when we were in mid-sentence  to clean it up. Instead of flagging someone else he continued to help the other table including going to get more napkins and new beverages for the group. This is after we had been waiting over 25 minutes with no bread or drinks besides water.  We decided to split the wagyu ribeye  for two along with mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. While the steak was good, we certainly weren't blown away. The sides were really basic and my husband even commented that the mashed potatoes I make at home were more flavorful than the ones they served us!   We were expecting a little bit of extra fanfare since we made it known that we were celebrating  a special occasion but unfortunately our experience was sub par."}
{"text":"I liked Eddie Merlot's! The service was excellent {we sat at the bar} but everyone was super friendly and quick. They have a cool wine list on an i-pad and you can click on each wine to see more about it ie: where it's from, flavors, pairings, etc. The food was DELICIOUS! We had the ahi tuna tartare, filet mignon potstickers, and salads -- everything was so good but the two apps were really great. The potsickers were handmade and the portion of the tuna was generous.   Pros: 1. Appetizers were great--multiple people around us ordered the calamari which we didn't try but it comes in this fancy sesame rice bowl! Super neat! 2. Wine selections (obvs) 3. Service  Cons: 1. I think they should put some food on their happy hour menu in the bar--more of a downtown crowd would go. 2. It's pretty fancy in there if you are just out and about downtown you might not feel dressed appropriately (not necessarily a bad thing--unless you are underdressed)"}
{"text":"We came here for wine and dessert! At least that's what I had on my mind. Jeff and Jim were our waiters for the evening. They made sure we were well taken care and were great at offering suggestions. I forget the wine we had, it was okay, but that's not the restaurant's fault. THIS DESSERT THOUGH. I had the Peanut Butter Cup. It was incredible. So rich, filling and hit so many points on my palette. I loved it. I would surely come back here even just for dessert! The ambiance was awesome, even the rolling low-sitting comfortable seats made me feel so welcomed and at home. I love this place."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to check out Eddie Merlot's, so when Pittsburgh restaurant week came around, I grabbed the opportunity!  In case you haven't checked out Pittsburgh Restaurant week in the past (and if you haven't, you must next time!), you usually get a smaller menu to choose.  You get an appetizer, entrée, and dessert for a set price. The restaurant week menu was pretty fair I thought, and the right price!, $35 for 3 courses compared to around $40 for just the steak.  Yep, it's an a la carte place, so be prepared.  My first course was absolutely delicious.  I chose the Caesar salad and it was a VERY generous portion.  The fresh ground pepper really took it over the edge.  They also delivered out a warm mini round loaf of bread for us to enjoy, which was quite tasty.    For my entrée, I chose the steak diane option.  Now I know what steak diane is and all, but for a fancy restaurant I thought the presentation was really lacking.  It looked like they had opened a can of wet dog food and poured it over mashed potatoes.  Luckily it tasted WAYYY better than it looked!  The steak was tender, melt in your mouth, with a wonderful gravy enhancing the steak's own flavor.  The mashed potatoes were thick, creamy, with just the right amount of chunks.  It would have been nice to have a vegetable on the plate as well, but alas, it was a restaurant week special.  If it wasn't ridiculously expensive, I'd love to come back and have a true steak.  For dessert, I had the carrot cake which was an overall small portion, but was just perfect after all the food I had already consumed.  More sweet than spicy carrot cake with a just right cream cheese frosting.  Loved the pineapple in the cake that added that extra sweetness and acidity!  The service was amazing.  Definitely a wine place, not a beer place.  Nothing is on tap and the only problem with the service was that the waitress did not seem to be very familiar with the beer list.  With craft brews becoming more and more popular, I would expect even a steakhouse to have a few that the staff can assist you in picking from.  Overall, it was a good, but not amazing, restaurant week menu and experience.  Would I go again?  Certainly not for full price, and most likely not for restaurant week.  I would hope that next time restaurant week rolls around their menu would be more similar to other steakhouses in Pittsburgh with more options."}
{"text":"I never have any complaints when I come here! The service is always exceptional and the food is perfect!   I typically like wine with my steak but decided to try their Strawberry Fields Martini. The best martini I've ever had! I don't typically like martini's. I'm more a fruity person and this was amazing.   Next we had oysters. They we're the best I've ever had but they were really good! I've had their crab cakes before and those are probably my favorite appetizer they have.   I also had the chopped salad which is great! The 7oz filet grilled perfectly along with the lobster Mac and cheese. Their Mac and cheese is too cheesy for me? I don't know if that's a bad thing. But it's just too heavy for me. But still good.   I've always been too stuffed to get dessert and have actually never tried any of their dessert."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and the staff was absolutely amazing! They made excellent drink and food recommendations!! I had the filet Oscar style with brussel sprouts and it was some of the best I've ever had!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre service on a not so busy night.  Three bartenders should be able to handle 14 bar patrons."}
{"text":"I was here with a group of people for my sister's birthday. We all had differing opinions of the restaurant, but personally, I was satisfied overall.  I'm not a huge fan of steak, so I never like it when I am invited to these types of restaurants. You know the places where everything on the menu is \"aged to perfection,\" ala carte, costs $60, and is the size of a golf ball. That being said, Eddie Merlot's did have some reasonably priced menu options to choose from in addition to the steak.  I had the barbecue braised short ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and a caesar salad. The meat was prepared perfectly! It was fork tender and the sauce was delicious. I enjoyed every bite.   The down side was that the overall service was very slow for the number of people in the restaurant at the time.   As a side note that I did not include when giving my rating, everything that my party ordered looked great, but some of the entree portions were unreasonably small."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my wife for dinner.  Having been in this place during its two previous restaurants, I was eager to see what changes, if any they had made.  I was not to be disappointed as Eddie Merlots had left the floor plan of the restaurant the same but they really did a good job on updating the decor of the place.  This was especially true in the chandelliers as well as the mosaics that were hanging along the walls.  For dinner my wife and I decided to start out the evening with the sesame calamari appetizer while she also chose to order the lobster bisque soup.  Thankfullly my wife was kind enough to save me one of the larger pieces of lobster in her bisque as well as some broth from it so that I could try it.  I have to admit that it was pretty good with the lobster being cooked perfectly and the bisque being seasoned nicely.  I also really enjoyed our calamari which came with three different sauces: a garlic/ginger soy sauce, ahot mustard sauce and a wasabi sauce.  The calamari was also cooked perfectly as the outside breading had a nice crunch while the inside was soft and chewy and not rubbery at all.  For my dinner entree I had a hard time deciding between the 16 oz. bourbon-marinated ribeye steak and the bison filet mignon.  My choice ultimately ended up being the bourbon-marinated filet which I made after consulting with our server.  My wife ended up going with the steak frites for her entree and we decided to split a side order of the macaroni and cheese.  The bourbon marinated steak ended up being quite large, tender and very good.  You could really taste the bourbon in and it gave the steak a subtle sweetness while at the same time giving it a bit of a bite which I had never had in a steak before.  The macaroni and cheese also ended up being good although it didn't have anything special that stood out to me.  After all of that food we still somehow had a little room for dessert and so we ended up ordering the carrot cake.  The piece that they gave us was absolutley humongus and could have easily been shared by a table of 4.  I ended up enjoying it as it tasted how I thought a carrot cake should.  With the dessert finished and the bill paid we ended up getting our parking validated at the hostess station and left the restaurant quite full but also a bit lighter in the wallet.  The bottom line for me is that I would head here again in the future.  The service that we received here was quite good and the food was as well."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a romantic dinner. Ordered the Bison Ribeye, and it was amazing. Cooked perfectly, with cream spinach and sweet potato casserole it was more good than I needed to eat...but I finished every bite. Wife had Alaskan Salmon, she said it was wonderful as well and then we split a peanut butter cup dessert that had the consistency of cheesecake but all the peanut butter flavor of a Reese's. Valentines Day dinner was perfect, wait staff was very professional and attentive."}
{"text":"If you want to go somewhere \"nice\" downtown for dinner or a business lunch and you have some extra $$$ to spend Eddie Merlot's is your place.  I was here for a business lunch meeting but we opted to sit and eat at the bar.  Located downtown, near Gateway Center and close to the Point, this is a great place to go to conduct \"high level business\" or, in my case, much \"lower level business\".    Both me and my lunch partner ordered a salad and the salmon BLT.  This comes with some amazing hot fresh bread.  Tried to be healthy but the bread probably tipped over on the caloric scale.  WORTH IT.  The house dressing with the salad was beyond amazing.  The BLT was probably as perfect as one can get to making a salmon BLT.  Great lunch choice.  It can get pricey so be prepared for that.  Lunch for two with iced tea cost me around $55."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a birthday lunch here with my girlfriend.  The restaurant itself was very clean with a classy feel. We enjoyed our crab wonton and crab cake appetizers. Next,  we got our entrées. My 14oz NY strip was good but not great. I wouldn't put it before Hyde Park,  capital grille or Ruth chris's.  On the other hand,  my girlfriend's spare rib meat loaf was amazing. The spare rib was in the center and was very tender. They piled mashed potatoes as high as the meat loaf to make it level for the friend onions. Keep in mind this was for lunch and the portion was enormous.  We will be back for lunch and one if not both of us will be getting the spare rib meat loaf. I almost forgot,  my girlfriend wanted to surprise me so she went to talk to the hostess and asked to have a desert brought to me. My girlfriend asked for something  red velvet (my favorite)  and sure enough they brought out a red velvet cupcake with butter cream icing. Oh and a cold shot of milk. It was complimentary as well! We enjoyed our time at Eddie Merlot's!"}
{"text":"Ouch! This was a pretty rough experience to say the least.  My boyfriend and I were walking around downtown the night before Thanksgiving when we decided to stop into Eddie Merlot's for a cocktail and a lite bite to eat. We took a seat at the end of the bar. I should note that there were two bartenders working, one of which was gobbling down what looked like chocolate cake or ice cream. There were less than 10 guests dining in the area. The chocolate devouring bartender approached and gave us a happy hour menu. He then walked away and continued noshing on his food. A couple minutes later the other bartender approached and asked us if we knew what we wanted. There weren't any cocktails that looked appealing to me, so I asked for the wine list. She then walked away and never returned. We gave it a couple minutes, hoping she'd pop back over but we ended up leaving. No water, no drinks, nothing in almost 10 minutes. Very disappointing experience. We made it a point to mention what occurred to the host and some other employee that was standing at the host stand. The other gentleman, not the host, offered to make it up to us. We kindly declined, left and walked over to Morton's for drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's not about the food and spirits (though both were incredible here) but rather the experience.  A friend and I stepped into this place late one night while in town.  Its stained glass decor was sending a beckoning, golden hue onto the street, and it attracted our curiosity.  We were in jeans and boots and almost turned right around when we saw the posh bar design.  But at that moment, a hostess - an elegantly dressed woman in pearls - must have sensed our second-guessing.  She immediately dispelled them.  \"Go ahead, boys.  Have a seat,\" she said as she passed.  Oh, 5 Stars for calling me a boy!  Anyway, the place was sparsely full.  It was the middle of the week.  The bartender served us well then just hung out and talked with us for an hour.  We were out-of-towners and in need of some direction.  He told where to go and when - where not to and why.  When we left we felt like:  if ever back in town, we have \"our spot.\""}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here last weekend. The restaurant is very nice, service and steaks were great. We tried the filet mignon and dry aged New York strip."}
{"text":"I couldn't have been more pleased. Went for their Mothers Day Buffet and the selection was out of this world. We could choose from the usual, eggs, bacon, made to order omelets to filet, cut to our liking. I am a meatloaf lover and their's was the best I ever tasted. Desserts filled almost the entire length of the bar. There isn't a bad word to say about the establishment and the decor is just as fabulous. The service was excellent, the entire staff was pleasant and accommodating. I would highly recommend and plan to return in the near future."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to dine.  Complete dinning experience.  From the quality of food, preparation, presentation to service spot on."}
{"text":"We were seated in a waiter's section, named Gordon. Gordon is an asset to this restaurant. +25 years experience, knowledge about the menu and a friendly gentleman.  He made our dining experience. By the end of the dinner, I wanted to shake his hand for the experience.  To the meal, we both had filets. I had the tri filet medallion, the sauces were fresh and delicious. The peppercorn was a touch much.  Amazing cuts of meat that melt in your mouth.  Try the Eddie potatoes."}
{"text":"If yelp gave the ability to give 0 stars, then I would do negative infinity.  This restaurant was not a good experience.  The ONLY thing good was the lobster bisque which they give you PLENTY of.  The service was horrible, so bad that I'm going to write an actual letter to headquarters to give them my displeasure on what was supposed to be a great Friday evening dinner.  I had jumbo stuffed shrimp, which the crab meat was overcooked and too many bread crumbs which masks the actual flavor of the stuffed shrimp. Also had the \"special\" which was red snapper oscar style with shrimp.  The shrimp were bagged freezer shrimp, want to know how I know? Because someone said \"oh, these are the shrimp that goes in your salad, I get these from the freezer section at the grocery store\" . A restaurant that's supposed to have quality food as such was very disappointing.  My waiter, Armindo was horrible.  I had to ask 2 people to get his attention and then when I got it he didn't pay attention to my actual needs, which was me asking for the check because I wanted to leave FAST! The food was so bad that I didn't even eat all of the 4 shrimp that was given to me. Go at your own risk.  Setting : blah.  Noise : Moderate.  Food : Did you read my paragraph of displeasure?  Cost : $117  Come Back : Not even if the food was free."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service.  Generously appointed surroundings and fresh linen were also appreciated.  The food was very good but a little less impressive than I anticipated for the price point.  The service made me feel like a family member so I would absolutely do it again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks due to how beautiful it looked from the outside. The menu looked great, but even after asking to see the menu, the bartender never came back to see if we would like to order. The drinks we ordered were ok, but nothing spectacular to match the decor."}
{"text":"I was in town for work. I wanted a steak house but wax sick of the capital grille. I went into Eddies and was pleasantly surprised.  I ate at the bar with Steve and Mike and they rocked. I strongly suggest going here to grab a drink and some grub."}
{"text":"Got the 16oz bone in Filet cooked a perfectly medium rare.  Hard to say what is the best Steak I've ever had at this point as I've had so many and this one ranks right up there with them.  The sweet potatoes were excellent and the side salad was perfect as well.  Girlfriend got the 7oz Filet and it was cooked perfect as well.  We split the crab cake that we added for $10.  That might be the only only thing I could pick on as it was in the really small side.  But it tasted really good.  We also split the creme brulee which was also really good.  Service was top notch.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Prior to dining here, I had read some of the reviews online.  I would have to echo the sentiments that were expressed.  The service was outstanding.  John, our waiter, was attentive and kind.  The room is beautiful and comfortable.  The lobster bisque was superb.  The issue was the preparing of the steaks.  This seems to be a common complaint on here about Eddie Merlot's.  Three people ordered steaks medium-well.  All three came medium-rare and were sent back.  They offered to butterfly them to which we all agreed.  They came back out without being butterflied and warmer, but not any more done.  Two things: I don't understand what is so difficult about cooking a steak to the desired temperature and secondly, if this sentiment has been expressed repeatedly on Yelp, why isn't Eddie Merlot's addressing it?  For the price, and make no mistake about it, this is one of the most expensive restaurants in the city, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the best food always is. Have been here a couple times but enjoyed it enough to go for the platinum club...."}
{"text":"The restaurant in general is just ok. It is over price for what it is. Our server was good. The rest were bad. The manager is not very friendly and lucks professionalism. The chef takes for ever to get the food ready. And the food presentation is ridiculous. They are trying to be high end but the only thing high is the price.  I think the most memorable experience about this restaurant was the bad energy among the staff members. The whole staff needs to be better trained starting with management."}
{"text":"Phenomal experience guys and it probably will exceed every expectation that you'll have going into the restaurant! Staff was amazing and very homely; it truly was a warm homely atmosphere.. And as much as I love the staff, the food was even better! I've been to many fine restaurants and I won't throw them under the bus.. This food trumps all of them."}
{"text":"This experience was deficient in many ways, but was salvaged by some outstanding employees, including a server whose intentions were good.  Welcome to wonderful Eddie Merlot's.  I wish you much success and fulfillment as you undertake the challenges of managing this fine restaurant.  Our reservation was for 6:00.  We arrived early and were seated at 5:40.  Weston, with whom I have conversed on prior occasions, is the consummate host.  He greeted us warmly, congratulated us on our anniversary, mentioned and honored my OpenTable preference for a booth in the most quiet area of the restaurant.  We were not disappointed with our seating.  The young lady who seated us was pleasant and gracious as well.  A young lady whom we thought might be our server promptly came to determine what type of water we would like and it was delivered. We were then \"dropped\" for more than fifteen minutes as we sat there, waiting for someone to take at least our cocktail orders.  Eventually, our server recognized our status and asked if someone had taken our order.  He stepped in to do so.  Cindy, whose charm and people skills are superior, had become aware of what happened and came over to apologize for our lengthy wait for service.  At this point we were more than ready to order. I believe that instead of assuming that every guest, including returning guests, want a lengthy presentation about the restaurant, that the server should ask whether we have dined there before and then see whether it is necessary to repeat what has been stated during prior dining experiences.  We would have politely declined if asked.  My wife's berry white martini was beautiful and delicious.  My summer ruby spritz was served on the rocks, which I did not realize from the description and did not request.  It was small and mostly ice, but also delicious.  Ground pepper was not offered with our salads, but Cindy promptly responded to my request for it.  I asked our server for the salads to be brought before the filet mignon pot sticker appetizer.  The salads came first as I requested, but he then forgot the appetizer as our entrees were delivered next.  I asked about the appetizer and he said it would be brought right out.  It arrived about ten minutes later.  The appetizer was tiny for the price, but tasty.  I was surprised that we were charged for it, given that it arrived well after the entree.  My pork chops entree was dry and not seasoned; the sauce that accompanied it helped.  My wife's chicken florentine was outstanding: tender, deliciously seasoned meat.  The server brought us dessert menus and suggested that Lizzie would be in the best position to give us the details, which she did.  She was engaging and pleasant.   It took a long time to receive the dessert after ordering it and then to receive the check.  When the check arrived, I found that my $35 Chef's Faves pork chop dinner, which I clearly specified I was ordering, was not on the bill.  Instead, there were a la carte charges of $32.95 for the same pork chops as offered in the Faves dish and $7.95 for the salad.  I brought this to the server's attention and he changed it appropriately.  After we had paid the check and ordered and consumed chocolate cake, it was recognized by the restaurant that this we were marking our anniversary as I specified in my reservation.  At that point, complimentary champagne and creme brulee were graciously brought to the table.  We could not do justice to the creme brulee as we had just finished the large order of chocolate cake.  Our server is charming, gracious, engaging, and suave, which went a long way toward erasing the facets of the meal that were not what we should have received.  Every staff member we dealt with was superior."}
{"text":"Perfect Valentine's Day spot. Awesome food and better service. My wife brought me here for valentine's day because I love a good steak. The food was cooked perfect. Our waiter was phenomenal. We did have to wait about 45 min even though we had a reservation but it was valentine's day so I'm not upset by it."}
{"text":"5 stars for the atmosphere and experience, 4 stars for the food.   We started the evening at 5:30 with drinks and appetizers at the bar. The drinks were good and had small twist on them. Meaning, they had spiced cherry moscow mule, instead of just plain mules. Prices ranged from $9-16.   For dinner, our waiters name was Gordon. He did a great job entertaining us and he enhanced the experience by having good conversations. We didn't leave until 11 PM.   I had the medium rare 7oz BMS 9+. With Brussels sprouts, asparagus, creamy corn, and french fries. The steak didn't meet my expectations, it didn't hold its structure in the middle and was somewhat spongy, medium rare shouldn't do this, the flavor was good, but not worth $100. The brussel sprouts and asparagus were not over seasoned or cooked and retained some of their natural flavor and healthiness, which was a relief.   For dessert we had the carrot cake, peanut butter cake, and banana foster. All were very good. The banana foster is cooked table side, but I think the presentation was underwhelming and didn't constitute preparing table side.   Overall this is a great place for food, great conversation, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow....we couldn't have asked for a better waitress! Shauna was phenomenal! She was down-to-earth, personable, and had great customer service. Not to mention the steaks were so great!!!! Tom was unbelievably friendly and made us feel right at home. I would recommend this place to every single person that comes to Pittsburgh.  We revisit every year!"}
{"text":"My daughter, Muff, is a special kid.  To celebrate her 18th birthday, I took her to Eddie Merlot's on New Years Eve.  Because she's such a swell chick, we ordered everything that she wanted.  To start, we had: Maryland Crab Cake - Jumbo lump crab, corn relish, Cajun remoulade 15.95(Smack your mama and everyone else, good!  One of my top five favorite crabcakes)  * Filet Mignon Potstickers - Hand-chopped filet, Asian flavors, wonton 13.95(Tasty!  Not Yank Sing-San Francisco good, but tasty) * Sweet and Spicy Shrimp - Tempura shrimp, sweet and spicy sauce 14.95 (Solid dish!  Nothing too fancy and on trend.) * Sesame Calamari - Sesame batter, trio of dipping sauces 14.95. (Superb presentation!  Would have been stellar with some additional seasoning.  Fab sauces accompanying the dish.)  Yeah, I know it's a lot, but my sister was there too...  For entrees, we ordered: Creekstone Farms Pork Chops - Two grilled 10 oz. chops, peaches, roasted garlic mashed potatoes, side Southern Comfort barbecue sauce$ 29.95(Damn!  Where did they get those pork chops?  Flintstone sized juicy pork chops with a smoking sauce.  Yeah!) Cedar Plank Roasted Salmon - Barbecue glaze, roasted garlic aioli, sautéed spinach, fingerling potatoes 31.95 (Perfectly cooked salmon and I mean, perfectly cooked!  Yummy-yummy in my tummy!) Grilled Shrimp - Chimichurri marinated shrimp, wild rice, zucchini, tomatoes, tomato jam 29.95. (Again, perfectly cooked and seasoned and HUGE!  If you are a shrimp lover, this dish is for you)  For sides, we ordered Macaroni and Cheese with Lobster - Five cheese sauce, lobster meat 23.95 and Parmesan Truffle Fries - French fries, truffle oil, Parmesan 9.95.  (Both dishes were actually tasty.  The Mac-N-Cheese could have used a little extra seasoning, but tasty.)  And unlike a lot of restaurants at this price point, they actually allowed me to bring in my own birthday cake and served it to us.  Perfection! I also can't rave enough about how excellent our service was...Again, superb! My bebe was totally pleased and she said that this was her best birthday and one of her best restaurant experiences EVER!    Those statements alone were worth the cost of the meal!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I am a Black Card Member at Eddie Merlot's which means that I eat there a lot and I do enjoy it usually dining at the bar. However lately they have changed the menu and made it much more expensive and less bar friendly most certainly. The removed the cheeses and charcuterie and the smaller carpaccio and other appetizers and now it is quite pricey to even just sit and have a drink. A poor decision to me. I can afford to eat anywhere so price is not an issue but rather value. In regards to the food. I love the Beet Salad, just an incredible dish and well presented and great for sharing. I usually will have the Medallion Trio which is three filet mignons each prepared differently, one peppercorn, one gorgonzola cheese topping and one with crabmeat and bernaise sauce along with a twice baked potato. Great for sharing. Their special app is the Bacon wrapped BBQ Shrimp which honestly though tasty, I have found to be a bit chewy. I do need to comment on the service. The best around Tiffany and the two Michaels behind the bar Andy and Jeff are among my favorite servers. This place can be pricey but if you do it right and share plates (there is a lot of food in each serving) it can be reasonable."}
{"text":"My son and I had a delightful meal sitting at the bar with Tiffany.  Great drinks, great food, great banter, great atmosphere and we met some delightful people too. We will return"}
{"text":"Delicious lobster bisque! The filet mignon was also to die for, as well as the salmon. The atmosphere was sophisticated yet relaxing.  The wait staff was excellent and personable. Would highly recommend for an upscale date night."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 12 at the last minute for a business lunch.  We arrived and  they showed us to a beautiful private room (not requested, what a nice surprise) and assigned us 2 servers.  The service, food and ambiance were PERFECT, and I thought the price was very reasonable.  I highly, highly recommend Eddie Merlot's."}
{"text":"Went here during restaurant week, we couldn't pass up a deal for $36 that included soup/salad, excellent steak and a dessert. The service was almost too good, they constantly kept checking on us and filling up our water, kinda annoying. I got the pork chops which were done perfectly. They came with a peach on top which I never heard of before. My fiancé and future mother in law got the stuffed tenderloins which was stuffed with vegetables. Extremely delicious however the wine was overpriced but definitely would go back again"}
{"text":"We came here Monday night for dinner as part of a large work group dinner. Overall the location was convenient to our offices as well as the hotels at which the out of town guests stayed. The menu had a nice assortment of cocktails and wines. I started off with the berry white martini, which consisted of strawberry and raspberry vodkas, fresh sweet and sour, dekuyper triple sec and fresh berries. It was really sweet and delicious but deceivingly strong (see pic).  Our host selected a group appetizer sampler which consisted of tuna wontons, bacon wrapped barbecue shrimp and prime rib potstickers. All were really good. The shrimp were huge. I also had a French onion soup (okay). For dinner, I selected the 10 oz filet rare. When my entree came out it was actually medium and I needed to send it back. The second time around was perfect. We also ordered a bunch of sides to share--Eddie Merlot's potatoes (okay), Mac and cheese (also okay) and Brussels sprouts.  We wrapped up dinner with some desserts. I passed on dessert as I was already full from dinner but ordered the Eddie Merlot's coffee, which I mistook to be non alcoholic (misread the menu). It was fine but I really just wanted a chocolate flavored coffee.  Overall the food was good but this is not the best steakhouse I have been to.  Service was decent but towards the end of the meal a little slow. Also, in speaking with my coworkers the day after, a few of them feel a little put off by the main waiter. They felt he was a little pushy I getting some of them to order the more expensive entree (vs the ordering off of the Monday night prix fixe menu). Also he got one of my coworkers a second glass of wine when she did not order one. And finally he served out the sides family style when only certain individuals wanted sides. We were a group of 13 and some of my coworkers felt he was up selling to maximize the tab, and ultimately the gratuity.  While I did not pay, I overheard one of the servers tell our boss that they were taking off some of the items from the tab due to some of the steaks not being prepared correctly. I thought that was really nice of Eddie Merlot's to do that!!"}
{"text":"It was extremely cold the day my friend and I went to Eddie Merlot's. We had planned to go somewhere fancy for dinner and the cold could not stop us. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted warmly by the sweetest and most welcoming staff who seemed genuinely concerned about our well-being (as we were clearly frozen from our trip to the restaurant). The restaurant is pretty large and we were seated at a table by the window.   My friend and I shared the sesame calamari appetizer which was delicious. The \"bowl\" that it is served in is edible! Additionally, I got a bowl of lobster bisque that was pretty standard. For my entree, I ordered the crab-stuffed shrimp. It comes with four shrimp in a row. Not the most impressive presentation, but the dish itself was fine. However, it is definitely pricey for what you get.   Since my friend was graduating later that semester, they sent over a salted chocolate cupcake. It was a very sweet gesture and we ate half of it (and took the rest back, of course) even though we were so full from our meal. As if that weren't enough, there were also two pieces of complimentary chocolate to end the meal.   The restaurant definitely attracts a more mature crowd. My friend and I were the youngest there by far, but we were still treated like everyone else. Service was excellent.   Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 5 OVERALL | 4"}
{"text":"Table was ready 45 min late. They gave us free apps for enough for 4/14 out of our table.  The main course took forever to come. I had to go the bar to get another drink. The filet was excellent though."}
{"text":"I Love the decor of this restaurant and all the floor to ceilings windows to see outside.   I had there filet and shrimp it was really good.  The waiter we had was very nice and attentive.  They gave us fresh bread, and were always filling up the water glasses. We went for an early dinner at 5pm on saturday so no problem getting a table at that time.   The menu is a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Honestly, the food was good but wasn't nearly good as I expected. I hear the name of this place mentioned a lot as being \"such a good steak house\". In my opinion, the food is average which makes it very overpriced. The service however, couldn't have been better. We has a waiter named Camron and he was on point. He was very professional, prompt, and friendly. The atmosphere of this place is very nice, it would be a great place to bring a date. Overall, it was a good experience. But the truth is, if/when I go back, it will be for the atmosphere and service, not the food."}
{"text":"We went here for their Mother's Day Buffet.  It was a last minute idea and lucky for us, we had no problem getting a reservation.  We had requested a booth and we got a wonderful and roomy curved booth with a wonderful view of flowering bushes outside.  The interior of the restaurant is beautiful, rich wood, beautiful lighting.  We were greeted right away and ordered beverages and advised that they would be delivered by our server.  And we were off to check out the buffet.  They had an omelet station and lots of breakfast items including muffins and pastries.  BJ started off with mac & cheese, meatloaf and fried chicken.  I went straight to the salads, Eddie's chopped salad as very good, the Waldorf salad was amazing.  So were the peel and eat shrimp.  They were a good size and the cocktail sauce had an extra kick.    For meats, they served hand craved ham and chateaubriand.  I loved both, BJ thought that the ham was a bit dry.  I thought that the cream horseradish needed more kick.  The chef did bring BJ some straight horseradish was the kitchen.    I can't say enough about the dessert bar which was set up in the bar area.  They had a lot a of tiny little choices.  The best was the pecan and chocolate bars and the tiny carrot cake cupcakes with cream cheese icing.  All in all, a good experience.  The only negative was our server.  She didn't know how to refill water glasses.  I drank both mine and BJ's before I got a refill.  BJ had to wait forever for an offer of another beer.  And she rarely took away our empty plates.  You know, it's not a tough shift, being a server for a buffet.  But it was for her.  Not the quality of service you would expect from an expensive steak house."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend the other day for the first time and I was extremely impressed by the service, interior, and ambience. It's a spacious dining establishment with a lot of contemporary/classical decor. The warm wooden furniture and rich, vibrant colors were great, especially juxtaposed to the lovely green view outside the glass windows. Service was great - maitre d explained everything to us and gave us great recommendations on the wine.  I had a glass of Decoy - Cabernet Sauvignon that has the exactly the level of fruitiness that I want. Nice, smooth and refreshing. I also loved that they had an iPad app for their wine list - made things so much easier to look up (you can search by age, type, price, etc.).  For the appetizer, I got the house salad, which was presented in this lovely angled bowl. Salad itself was alright, croutons were fantastic and fresh. Not your typical, gross, stale, Olive Garden croutons.  Bread was amazing too - a bit logistically hard to eat without making a mess haha, but so warm and fluffy. Seasoned very well too, and the butter that came along with it was delectable.  Main dish for me was the Steak Diane. They asked me how I wanted the steak to be prepared and I said medium rare, like always. However, it was basically well done when I got it. Also, it wasn't so much what I consider a steak rather than a stew. It really just reminded me of a beef stew sprinkled over mashed potatoes. Bland. Heavy. Disappointing.   Dessert redeemed itself - I had a slice of the carrot cake and it was probably the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. Moist, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. I was so impressed. The frosting was a bit heavy for me, but then again, most frostings are heavy for me. Very pleased with the carrot cake.  Beautiful venue, lovely staff, great wine, decent food. I think I just ordered the wrong dish - my friend got the cedar plank salmon and was very pleased. Might come back again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the filet mignon sliders and requested the mushrooms on the side, however, they put the onions and the mushrooms on the side all mixed together so I had to pick out the onions and put them on my sandwich. Additionally, the sliders were missing the garlic aioli. Maybe there was confusion because I asked for an additional side of aioli for dipping my fries?  Aside from those minor mishaps, the sliders were cooked perfectly. My boyfriend ordered the waygu steak for $100 and he said he felt it should have been a better cut- more of center cut. It was a little on the thin side and tasted a bit gamey. However, the temperature (rare) was perfect.  We have been here a few times and have always had a great meal. It is definitely solid. In regards to the service, the bartender, Tiffany, is absolutely amazing. She doesn't make mistakes. She is patient, kind, social, knowledgeable, and has a great smile! She let us stay after closing to watch the end of the Pens game too. Pretty awesome!  Overall, definitely recommend it here!"}
{"text":"The reception staff are great.  The bartender was great.   Then, our party of 12 was seated and it went south from there.   Escargot was not seasoned and very bland.   Lobster Mac and Cheese was very dry and had too much bread crumbs     The Mahi Mahi was overlooked, dry and hard.    Everyone at our table who ordered a steak were reaching for salt.  Meals were under seasoned.   One guest ordered a crab cake appetizer and filet for the main course.  She received an entree of crab cakes, no filet - no apologies.    Our server was MIA for more than 30 minutes.    Our guests left and we didn't see him for another 17 minutes.    When he came back, it was with the check and he forgot a dessert.     Too bad the dining room couldn't match the service at the bar. Too bad for us, we had higher expectations for the $700+ check."}
{"text":"I would love to go four and 3/4 stars but I have to go with what I am given. The only little criticism I have is that the steak was a little salty but don't get me wrong it was still phenomenal! We got there a little early and were told they were not ready to seat us yet but we could enjoy the bar. We did so. Tiffany was our bartender and she was friendly and knowledgeable. The hubby got a gin and tonic and as gin and tonics go this one was mixed just right. I chose the white sangria which was light and refreshing and looked so summery and pretty. We were summoned by the host, Watson (I believe this was his name and if it was not I am sorry). He was friendly and prompt. We were taken to our table which had a nice view of the patio area. We were greeted promptly by John, our waiter. He was attentive and knowledgeable all evening. He was spot on but not in our faces even working to get me a few scallops as my \"surf\". Perfect! We got bread immediately which was fresh and warm. We got apps. I got the fried calamari which was fresh and the breading was light and not overly greasy. It came with a trio of dipping sauces which were wasabi, soy, and mustard all were good. I liked mustard the best. The hubby got the lobster bisque which was creamy and rich with flavor. For our main course I got a ribeye, medium rare as did the hubby. They were cooked perfectly. They are amazing even though a smidge salty...still amazing and juicy. Yum! I got surf and turf so I got two scallops with my steak. The scallops are not listed as a surf item but I asked and they worked it out for me. (Thank you John and Mr. Chef). The scallops were so fresh, cooked to perfection, and the texture buttery. Wow! We got three sides which are huge and most certainly shareable. We got the sweet potato casserole which could be dessert as well, my favorite! We got mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts as well they were good too. The hubby got after dinner coffee which was really good as far as coffee goes and I got the peanut butter cup which was rich and light (if that makes any sense). From start to finish, it was phenomenal! It is a little pricey but we expected that.  It helped that we had a gift card that we got for Christmas a few years ago and a coupon. Can't beat that! We thoroughly enjoyed our 15th anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"This review is hot off the press as my belly is still full from the mouthwatering meal that I just had.  I just gained 10 pounds from dinner tonight and I am one satisfied customer.  1st time eating here and everything that I ordered was delicious.  The  complimentary loaf of bread was warm and very tasty.  The wedge salad was amazing - hands down one of the best salads I've ever had in life.  Then I ordered the bone-in filet mignon.  It was seasoned just right and the outside seared to perfection.  Thinking about it right now is making my mouth water.  Even their brussel sprouts were delicious!  For dessert I got the bananas foster and it was made right in front of me!  (See video below)  The service was top notch.  Our waiter, Armindo, kindly explained the specials and what he recommended on the menu.  Even paired our meal with a great cabernet wine.  The venue was very intimate, very classy decor.  Wonderful place for date night.  Pretty pricey but worth every penny!  I came here for a work event so after dinner, my colleague and I hung out at the bar to recap the night.  Our bartender was excellent.  Great conversationalist and gave us lots of tips regarding the Pittsburgh area.  He even gave me a free slice of carrot cake on the house!  If you know me, sweets are the way to my heart and Eddie Merlot, me and you are going steady from now on!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Eddie Merlot's from my brother I finally had the opportunity to visit for a family dinner. I was not disappointed at all. The food is outstanding and the service is beyond excellent. The staff really goes out of their way to make sure that your meal is the finest experience. I enjoyed the filet with some sides - and the steak was cooked perfectly. I highly recommend Eddie Merlot's for a real indulgence!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal evening at Eddie Merlot's!! As a couple of broke kids, a fancy dinner doesn't come around too often. My boyfriend has been building the suspense for our anniversary dinner for a while, and it was definitely worth the agonizing wait.   Upon arrival, we were greeted and seated with little wait time. The menu is very extensive, but unfortunately for my vegetarians, the gnocchi is the only vegetarian entree other than salad. However, after speaking with the host, the chefs are able to make off menu items at your request to fit any dietary restrictions - very accommodating!  We couldn't decide between the Parmesan Truffle Fries or the Spinach & Artichoke Dip as a starter, so we did what any logical person would do....we ordered both. It turned out to be a wise choice because both were delicious. The fries were hand-cut and deep-fried to perfection. I shamelessly took more than half my share. The dip was sooo cheesy with huge chunks of artichoke  to dunk in with the golden crispy pita. Excuse me while I wipe my drool from this keyboard.   For the main event, I went with the Vegetarian Gnocchi and the Romaine Waldorf salad on the side. I love fruity salads, and their Waldorf was the best I've had! Everything from the fresh fruit to the subtly sweet vinaigrette was incredible!  As I turned my attention to the gnocchi, I was a little disappointed to find that it was very undercooked; however, I got a fresh plate of perfectly cooked gnocchi once I notified the staff. The sauce had a savory yet sweet alfredo taste. I licked my plate clean because it was that good! My only complaint is that the portion size was a bit too small. I may look tiny, but this girl can eat.   My boyfriend ordered the 16 oz Prime Ribeye Steak as his entree, and he would definitely not recommend it. After requesting the steak to be cooked medium rare, it came out rare. The taste of the meat itself was great; however, the steak was so tough that each bite took the poor kid a solid minute to chew. He built some fantastic jaw muscles that day, but needless to say, he was unimpressed. $50 for a dry, chewy steak? Pass.  Now to my favorite part: let's talk dessert!! After we told our waiter it was our anniversary, we received a complimentary Creme Brulee with a candle on top - adorable! We also ordered the Triple Chocolate Cake which was a mammoth! A bit dry but overall, it was incredible. We tackled what we could, but it got the best of us. Round 2 in the morning!  Last, but certainly not least, our waiter David was unbelievable! I wish I could pack him up and take him home with me. He was so friendly, attentive, and efficient. Whenever I needed him, he was there. Even with the uncooked gnocchi issue, he was able to resolve it quickly and ensured I was happy with the new plate. The man even got us an extra dessert which means he won my heart.   To conclude this very long review, if you can fit an excruciatingly expensive meal into your budget, I would say it's definitely worth the experience of a beautiful evening with good food and great service at Eddie Merlot's!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!!  Worth every dime!  Great service and amazing food!!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Coming from San Antonio to meet my friends whose son is going to CMU.  They are from China  and this was their first time in Pittsburg and I thought it would be a good idea to treat them a nice steak.  Therefore picked this place as the reviews on Yelp were pretty decent.  Indeed, the steaks here were excellent.  I had a ribeye and it was delicious, tender, juicy and very tasty.  My friends had bone-in fillets and they loved the steaks.  Don't mean to brag, I have been many 5-star steak houses, but this one is definitely on par with the others.  The service was excellent. We were there on last Sunday and many wines were half price!!!!  We killed 3 bottles.  And the desserts were awesome.  Anyway I high recommend this place and would come back again next time visiting Pittsburg!"}
{"text":"About a year ago the the tomahawk ribeye was one of the best steaks we ever had. Tonight it was one of the worst."}
{"text":"Great palace for a nice steak meal. Equally nice was the wait staff. I really liked the Merlot salad and the ny strip! My husband said the peanut butter cup was one of the best desserts he's ever had."}
{"text":"J took me here for my birthday last weekend. We parked in the garage which was fully validated by the restaurant, which was a plus in our book! We made reservations for 9pm and were seated within 10 minutes. The restaurant was beautiful from top to bottom (literally!). The staff were great from the hosts to the woman at the coat check and our waiters. We were seated by the window which was a great view. I ordered a glass of white wine, resiling, and J ordered a coke. We had delicious bread to start! I ordered the beet salad as my appetizer which was delicious. J ordered the Merlot Iceberg without tomatoes. He ate all of it which was great because he never really finishes salads. For our main meals, I ordered the sea bass with balsamic glaze, maple vinaigrette, and veggies. J had the crab legs. For our sides we ordered broccoli, macaroni and cheese, and hash browns. The portions are hhhhuuuugggeee!! We took 3/4 of our food home because it was no joke. The food was delicious though. We couldn't leave without having dessert. Since it was my birthday, I received a complimentary creme brûlée which was delicious!! J and I also shared the vanilla cognac brownie which was...decadent and luxurious. When watched it being prepared at our table and it was food porn at its finest. Our total bill was around $160 which was great since the overall experience was amazing. Definitely recommend hitting this place up for a nice night out."}
{"text":"This quite possibly was one of the best dining experiences ever.  We arrived with a party of 14, seated promptly and attended to with perfection by our waitress Tera.  She was able to perfectly suggest apps that were not too much or too little for the table. The presentation of the apps were eye appealing and they all tasted delicious.  We ordered the sesame calamari, ahi tuna wontons and crab cakes, all were cooked to perfection an beautifully presented.  Dinner for me was sesame ahi tuna, slightly seared but left perfectly rare served with seaweed salad.  Yummmmmm!  Others tried the braised short ribs, various cuts of steaks, salmon and the roasted bell and evens chicken.  There was not one complaint at the table, everything was cooked perfectly.  Then came dessert......WOW.  We had 2 tableside presentations, bannanas foster and vanilla congnac brownie with a creme brule also.  Do yourself a favor and order one of the tableside presentations, delicious and worth it for the presentation by the waitstaff!  This is one amazing restaurant, decor, wine choices (which were simply jawdropping), ambiance, service, food and value. I said value because I think that for apps, meal and dessert with this type of perfection that was about $100  per person (without drinks) is reasonable. This is not something i could afford often but would certainly want to visit several times a year if I lived local which sadly i do not.  Please come to CT, MA or RI, we would welcome you with open arms.  Thank you for a really memorable meal and remember, ask for Tera!  Kerry"}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend and his family for his birthday celebration. This is the best steak I've had. I got the ribeye oscar style (so fricken good), we all shared brussel sprouts, eddies potatoes, and mac and cheese. The potatoes were okay, not bad just a little bland. The brussel sprouts were amazing however, and the mac and cheese was also to die for. For dessert I had the bananas foster and WOW was it good. Pricey for sure, but well worth it if you are looking for a nice meal. Definitely one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"A good friend recommended this place, so my husband and I decided to try it this past weekend.  When I made the reservation, I was asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, so I said yes- we would be celebrating my husband's birthday.  I thought this was a nice touch and assumed they would do something special for him (a complimentary dessert, glass of champagne, etc.) as we have experienced this at other restaurants.  Upon arriving at the restaurant, we checked in with the hostess who said \"Happy Birthday\" and took us to our table.  We were seated in a small room with about 3 other couples and 3-4 tables of very large, very loud parties.  We could barely hear each other which was extremely annoying.. Our waiter came to  greet us and asked how we were doing.  We asked how he was doing as well, which turned out to be a mistake, as every time he came back to our table he began complaining about how much he loathes Valentine's Day and can't wait to be done with his shift.  When ordering our meals, he asked us both if we wanted soup or salad with our dinner- as if a choice of one came with the meal... we later found out they did not.  I feel that he should have mentioned this to us.  Also, I ordered a filet cooked medium that was unfortunately well done (and rather tough) when it got to our table.  My husband's rack of lamb was mediocre at best.  Other couples around us were complaining about how loud and UN-romantic the setting was considering most were out to celebrate Valentine's Day. All in all, considering the noise level, grumpy waiter, just average food, no extra touches for a special occasion and a $175... totally not worth it."}
