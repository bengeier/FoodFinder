{"text":"Solid coffee choice. A bit cramped for seating and parking can be a challenge both with safety and space availability. Convenient location and service is consistently good."}
{"text":"I must've got a new employee on her first day, because this is the absolute worst vanilla latte I've ever tasted. Honestly, it's just a cup of coffee w/ vanilla syrup pumped into it. Not cool. Train your employees better."}
{"text":"Love their coffee.
They need to add help in the morning.
With all the moms and high school kids ordering double latte whatever's there is a line to the door from 7:45 to 9:00.
I'm not going to wait for ten minutes for a cup of plain coffee.
Usually buy beans there and make at home. But now when I want to stop in to grab a cup to go, I go elsewherel
They should have someone who only takes straight coffe orders. They would get more business."}
{"text":"Always fantastic. I'm there at least once everyday. And they participate with the Loyal Tree app with awesome rewards."}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointed would best be the title for my review.

Before I begin, let me say that I have been to other Coffee Tree Roasters. I also am an avid coffee drinker and therefore have a fair amount of knowledge that can be used to compare this place with others.

I visited awhile back. Upon arriving I immediately didn't feel welcome. There were four baristas there and I had to wait over a minute before one of them even greeted me. After ordering I decided upon a mocha. It tasted like hot chocolate. Where was the coffee flavor? All the while I noticed the four baristas standing in a corner laughing with one another while giving off an \"exclusive high school club\" vibe. Geez!

AND....when I left (mind you there was only one other customer in the lobby) I took up my dishware, as well as some others on a nearby table and the dude working just gave me a look and didn't even say thank you! Things like that really bother me. Let me tell you, as somebody who has worked in retail and food it can be a PAIN to be friendly towards customers, but it's just something that should be done in that business.

Bottom line: Not terrible, but very underwhelmed by the coffee and service. I highly recommend the Caribou Coffee right across the street. The baristas have always been pleasant and the drinks quite good! I have had far better experiences at the Coffee Tree Roasters in Shadyside and Squirrel Hill which tells me that this one certainly can become better!"}
{"text":"I love Coffee Tree Roasters coffee. I can proudly call myself a \"coffee snob\". I come here for plain old black cups of coffee and it is the best! I have been to some of the best coffee shops in NYC and LA and everywhere I go I compare them to Coffee Tree. 

Their coffee is always freshly roasted and brewed.

No need for fancy pour overs or French presses. Their coffee shines on its own. I can't get enough of it!

I recently moved from the area but will certainly continue to buy pounds of coffee from them since nothing else compares."}
{"text":"One of the best latte's I've ever had. Damn good I tell you. And they even put a little heart with the cream. What do you know."}
{"text":"Excellent espresso, with quick service.  Priced right too.  Parking can be a little tricky but worth the stop."}
{"text":"I know my coffee and Coffee Tree Roasters gets a 2 snaps and hands held high. I can't believe it took me so long to sample and fall in love with their coffee. 

I love Starbucks for their tea but Coffee Tree has a wide variety of freshly roasted beans and I've never had a bad cup here. Quite frankly, each new flavor of the day I try tends to get better and better. Some of my faves have been the Papua New Guinea, Sumatra and Vienna Roast. These are the medium roast varieties which serve my purpose of waking up well. I love how you can take in these flavors and easily differentiate the the variance in balance and strength.  The coffee is never bitter and tastes fresh regardless of when I visit. I also love the fact that they have the little stickers that cover the coffee lid hole---so cute and fun. 

It must be said that this place prides itself on freshly roasted beans.  If you want to brew your own at home, they have a huge menu for you to select from. There also are teas, coffees, chocolates and a gift section near the check out area.  It's a very cozy space and would be nice to catch up with a friend or two.  Keep in mind that the seating is limited here so you may need to wait for a table if you plan on enjoying their goodies in house. 

Be forewarned that their baked treats are to die for and they tempt you with samples on the counter. If you try a sample be prepared to have thoughts of sugarplums dancing in your head throughout the day along with wondering why you just didn't buy a whole piece of whatever you tasted.  

The service here is fast, efficient and friendly. Heck, I've been in a line back to the door with 1 worker at the counter who managed to serve everyone quickly."}
{"text":"Good drinks and service. Found a dessicated fly in bottom of my latte once but outside of that I have been satisfied. Just hope they look in the cups more often."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Coffee is decent, but whatever they use for espresso beans lacks bite.  Tastes more like a medium roast and does not leave that good aftertaste at the back of my tongue.

Combine this with unfriendly service and I'll just go elsewhere. The young ladies in here midday act bothered to take my four dollars. 

I won't bother them anymore."}
{"text":"Good coffee - I'll give them that. But beware when using your debit card here. I don't know if it's their software or employee error, but on two separate occasions I was charged twice for the same cup of coffee and pastry here. Both times I went in, and they promptly rectified it - but kind of annoying, no?"}
{"text":"This place has great coffee. Much better than big name brand coffee places. Always a must stop when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Good prices, better coffee.  The food never looks good so I haven't tried it.

I sometimes stop here for coffee before work, the baristas are always friendly--even at 6:02 am, right after opening. If you're in the area I recommend it over the Starbuckses (what is the plural of that?!) in Giant Eagle or B&N in the waterworks mall."}
{"text":"OK, so I promised I'd be back, and I made good on that promise. Went there this morning to refuel - this time with lattes. I must say our coffee was tasty and since we didn't go for foam, they were about right in terms of the volume. Definitely a great place to stop in for a cup of coffee from now on when I'm making my way to work. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, good service, lots of sweets to choose from & they are all huge! I don't come here too often, but when I do, I always have a good experience. Everyone is always friendly."}
{"text":"I have never had a better cup of coffee. I went in with my boyfriend expecting to maybe get a cold drink or some tea, then there on on the menu \"ALMOND MOCHA\". I was like, eh why not try something new. It was amazing. SO GOOD. I would highly recommend getting your coffee from this place and try the Almond Mocha. It will not disappoint you!!"}
{"text":"I stop ay this Coffee Tree most mornings on my way to work.  Their coffee is great, service is good and friendly.  One morning I got a cinnamon muffin and it was amazing...my co workers didn't know that they had them.  My favorite is their salted caramel cold brews....It is SOOOO yummy and refreshing.  I love Starbucks vanilla sweet cream, but this one actually edges them out of first place in my book!!  Another wonderful Pittsburgh chain!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan. They've won me over. They've got a great menu of all kinds of tasty mixed espresso based drinks in addition to the basics. More than a neat little corner shop, they have great coffee. This may come from the fact that they roast all their beans in Pittsburgh for their 6 locations. They roast a good bean and it's noticeable. Priced like any other coffee shop, why not stop in here over some Starbucks or McCafe if you're in the Aspinwall area? This might be a new spot for me for buying my own beans for some homebrewing too. Again, can't stress enough the difference starting with a good bean makes.
The baristas were very friendly and fun too. They had no problem fielding my barrage of questions about their brand."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer for this Coffee Tree location for a few years - so it's about time I wrote a review.

I love the fact that this small, local chain uses beans roasted right here in Pittsburgh. I like the choices of drinks and snacks. I've never had anything but friendly service. Prices are comparable to just about any other choice of coffee shop in the area. And now, with the LoyalTree app, every few visits, I earn a free mocha latte. Parking is okay - except during the rush hour/before school crowd.

I go out of my way to grab coffee at the Fox Chapel Coffee Tree!"}
{"text":"When I walked in here I really thought I had been in this style coffee house before. I was right. Coffee tree roasters is a chain throughout the Pittsburgh area. Most of the menu consists of lattes, mochas, and some tea. They let me sample today's coffee selections. I ended up with Costa Rico which was a decaffeinated blend. All along the back wall they sell chemex, various coffee equipment etc.

They also have a wall devoted entirely to teas along with tea pots. Premium and pricey roasts are in the far corner. They have a small selection of baked goods which they told me comes from various bakeries. They had samples of pumpkin biscotti which I tasted. It was to die for!

They have a small seating area and of course WiFi. I was having some difficulty connecting to it as I was being thrown off due to other networks. I eventually managed to get into theirs.

They coffee is okay. Nothing to write home about but a good alternative if you want to avoid the more popular chains. It sits around the corner in the Fox Chapel strip mall."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and the coffee is horrible. I wrote a review about it before and was removed because the owner complained saying it was personal. I don't know the owner but they must be afraid of the truth. Sorry that the place is dirty and sorry the coffee is bad and sorry you can't take bad reviews. Ok I said I was sorry . Clean up, get better coffee and train you help better."}
