{"text":"New neighbors of indeterminate origin recently moved in next door, and such luxuriously mouthwatering, deeply rich cooking smells issue forth from under their door every eve that I dream of befriending them so that at some point they will invite me over for a homecooked meal, slapping me on the back with gaiety and smiling benevolently as I exclaim with a shimmer of tears in my eyes, that I've never had anything as delicious as what they've cooked in the comfort of their home, just for me.  Well, that will probably never happen because in my apartment complex no one ever acknowledges the existence of another unless there is a Problem.  However, this past Friday I got a scrumptious taste of what that reverie would feel like if made tangible at the Peruvian restaurant Pucapuca.  The square, austere dining salon at that time was relatively empty but immediately the owner (also waiter, maitre d' and cook...in fact I'm pretty sure he was the only one in the whole establishment) filled the place up with his warmth and kindly smiling eyes, immediately making us feel like his favored grandchirren.  When he described the prix-fixe menu though, we just about fell out of our seats: 15 CAD for a starter, entree, hot drink and dessert?? On a Friday night in Mile End in Montreal?? We quickly composed ourselves and took to scrutinizing the menu- for entrees, among us four we got dishes of quail, smothered pork chops, spicy beef stew, and stewed chicken in peanut sauce.  The salads and soups we ordered as starters were satisfying, homey and flavorful.  But the entrees.....! Tabarnak! Each plate came heaving with a non-fussy array of food, a scoop of stewed root veggies, a hill of aromatic rice, a mess of peas, and then the meat front and center.  Our table devolved into a chaotic tangle of forks and knives as we dived into our own and each others' dishes...every one was sublime.  The pork chop, smothered in a tomato and beer sauce, was especially wonderful; the best pork dish I've ever tasted in a restaurant.  Even though we were at breaking point after the dinner, we all wedged in a small slice of cake for dessert.  All this, handled with genuine familial feeling from the delightful owner/chef/waiter... it was quite the dining experience.  I'm sad that my return trips back there will be broken up by months of time. If you live in or visit Montreal, you MUST go here!"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch all the time.  The menu is small but its cheap and tons of food. For  lunch:  Meat (or fish) + rice + vegi+ soup+ desert + coffe for $8.  Can't beat that.  I love the owner as well.  He's totally awesome."}
{"text":"Ceux qui ont déjà voyagé au Pérou vivront un petit moment de nostalgie en allant manger chez Puca Puca. Pas seulement pour la cuisine, qui soit dit en passant, n'est pas appréciée à sa juste valeur, mais aussi pour la chaleur, le respect et la jovialité du personnel. Dans une décoration photographique relativement sobre, nettement plus déployée sur des couleurs de terre cuite, l'on est invité à découvrir des mets locaux hors du commun. D'ailleurs, le terme inca «Puca Puca » de la langue quechua, signifie littéralement « rouge rouge ».  Ciro, propriétaire des plus attachants, est né dans la contrée péruvienne de Pucallpa, signifiant \"terre rouge\"...Petit clin d'il à la Pachamama!...  Les spécialités du restaurant se distinguent en trois grands volets : les patates! (le Pérou est le jardin d'Éden des patates), les viandes et les poissons. Personnellement, il m'est impossible d'ingurgiter quoi que ce soit qui provienne de l'océan; mais les engoués de fruits de mer feront des découvertes exotiques.  Sacrilège! Il n'y a pas très longtemps de cela, il était possible de se procurer la très prisée Cusquena Negra, une bière noire inca, au bon goût de caramel et très désaltérante, brassé avec de l'eau des glaciers des Andes! La distribution au Québec s'est malheureusement interrompue... Quoique très éloignée du Soleil de Cusco, comme prix de consolation, vous pourrez toujours siroter une Boréale fraîche...ou encore un Pisco..  -Vous vous en tirerez pas si mal pour une vingtaine de $  -Dommage qu'il n'y ait pas de décoctions à la feuille de coca...oups...j'oubliais...c'est illégal au Canada."}
{"text":"Great food ,great service and great experience.  Ciro,the owner was our host, chef and server.  It felt like we were dining at his home. He made us feel welcome and both quality and quantity were just right.  I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Puca Puca breaks just about every rule that comes to mind when it comes to restaurants (decor is drab, it's poorly lit, air circulation is nonexistent). But it more than makes up for it in its homey charm and tasty yet bountiful food at a bargain basement price.  For a laughably tiny $8 dollars, you get:  - A soup of the day - A main dish consisting of a protein of your choice (fish, pork, chicken or beef meatball) with a side of steamed veggies, beans and rice - A soft drink of your choice  - A dessert (sometimes a costco muffin or dad's oatmeal cookie).  And all of this is offered to you by a charming man who is both front of house and back of house, so waiter, cook and cashier. Watching him juggle all this at the same time is quite impressive. He certainly always earns my $2 tip."}
{"text":"Oh wow!! une belle découverte!! Le resto ne paie pas de mine de l'extérieur, ni même de l'intérieur, mais il vaut vraiment la peine! Nous y sommes allés le midi et pour vous faire patienter, on vous donne une grosse soupe maison super bonne et ensuite, vous aurez le choix entre quelques plats typiques (tilapia, truite, raie, poulet aux arachides, boulettes de boeuf aux raisins, porc), accompagnés de riz, fèves noires et carottes Le TOUT (soupe + plat) pour la modique somme de 8$ !!! Par contre il ne faut pas être trop pressé, car le petit papy est tout seul au service et derrière les fourneaux... A essayer à tout prix!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh myyyy goshhhhh why didn't I come here sooner!! A choice of meat, rice, beans, salad, soup, drink AND dessert for only $8! Not only is it totally worth it but the food was absolutely delicious. I really feel like it's food cooked from grandma's heart. I would 1000% recommend and will be returning very soon.   P.s. This is the only restaurant that I gave a 5 star right off the bat. Great value for delicious food will always win my heart and keep me coming back"}
{"text":"My colleague and I came here and we were very very pleased with the food and service.    So it's $8, for an appetizer, dish and drink. We got full dish of fish, black beans, carrots and rice. My colleague had a salad and I had a chicken soup. In the end we had some coffee (you switch it for a soft drink).    The gentleman (I'm assuming is the proprietor and also the cook), was very sweet and made the experience very pleasant."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the office. This place is a one man show and it's good. Small menu selection with a small price to match. It's nothing fancy, but it's homey and hearty."}
{"text":"Best lunch deal in Montreal. Homey, welcoming, delicious. 2:30pm closing time except Saturday nights. Best to call ahead to see if they're open for dinner. As in most Latin American countries there is a soup of the day, a limited selection of entrees and coffee or tea, all for Vegetable soup had fresh corn. Mains were meatballs or chicken breast in a tangy peanut sauce with seasoned carrots, lots of rice and black beans. Huge plate. All for $8. Support this place, please. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Go to lunch!  Nothing fancy here, just great Peruvian cooking at a ridiculous price!   Service is friendly and if you want to talk about the sights to see in Peru, boy! Does the owner ever have some stories!  Everything tastes like it was made at home by a caring mother (or father). The fish is out of this world.  Like I said, nothing fancy, the decor is simple, almost bleak, but everything else is so awesome, you won't even notice after a while."}
{"text":"This is one of the best kept secrets in the city.  I had been driving by this place for the last 15 years and wondered about it. Food was great...not good but great. Everything is made from scratch. No menu, the one man show/owner gives a choice of 3 different meats as a daily special. After that, your in and out in 25 minutes for $10.00 or less including tip. If you're not picky about the decor as the inside hasn't been renovated in decades, it is a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Man this place reminds me Ie le de cuca (brazilian place that burned down few years ago).. Kinda like u r down in Cuba or Mexico.. Awesome owner + awesome good + super cheap... Go u will love it"}
{"text":"We had a lovely two-and-a-half hour dinner here. The salad-dinner-dessert combo is only $15, and the salads were excellent. The main course choices are a bit limited, I guess, but I liked the skate a lot. The desserts were apple pie and coconut cake, don't know if those are traditional Peruvian desserts but I'm not complaining.  The owner is very friendly and happy to tell the story behind the restaurant's name. But don't get him started talking about Alberto Fujimori."}
{"text":"Reviewers are confusing authentic with traditional. Puca puca does not make traditional dishes (at least in the Lunch hour, I know the menu changes at night) but offers meals seasoned and cooked the way food would be made in Peruvian homes.   The dish always contains some sort of meat, a good white rice portion (5 stars for that!) and some veggies. With this dish, you get also a soup for entrée, a dessert and a drink, all for 8 dollars tax included. This emulates a thing in Peru called \"menú\" which is a very low cost lunch combo with a few options for entrée and few options for main course, a drink and sometimes depending on the price, dessert or not (and it's usually sold from 2$ to 5$).  The owner is also cook, host and waiter, a very Latino thing, to run everything by yourself, and he's the nicest!"}
{"text":"Amazing foodHidden gem and so inexpensive. You can order app main meal and desert for 8.00, really good quality"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of the city! I think not a lot of people would come in, the outside makes the place look like it has seen better days. The decor inside was not the fanciest however the food and ambiance reminded me of home.   As we walked into the restaurant, the owner greeted us and proceed with retrieving soup for our meal before we ordered! What a nice guy!   For $8, you can't really go wrong with this all you can eat meal! I hope to come back soon and bring as many friends as possible! It's a home cooked meal outside with all the spices and tastiness of any classy restaurant!"}
