{"text":"We were really excited about this new concept for a bar but were extremely disappointed upon arrival. It wasn't busy at all so we walked up to the bar and the bartenders made eye contact but never greeted us or even said \"I'll be with you in a second\" ..nothing. We looked at the drink menu and SEVERAL items were crossed off with black pen due to them being under stocked . They were so poorly stocked that they didn't even have 12oz Bud Lights - only tall boys. The regular cocktail items seemed to be wildly overpriced as well; but we couldn't try any because they were out of a lot of liquors and mixers. The bartenders did not seemed to be trained and took forever to cash us out on two beers - the one we had looked like she was more interested in flirting with her male counterpart than serving customers. 

Besides the below par service, the place did not live up to its advertisements of \"adult playground.\" If anything, it's a smaller Queen Park Social. There's a lot of empty space in there that is not being utilized. They had card games, table top Jenga and a ping pong table. They have more couches than activities. The patio area is very small and cramped together with about five tables. 

We didn't even try the food because there were so many items marked out on that menu, too and it didn't seem like anyone was working at the food station anyways. 

Very disappointed that this place did not live up to expectations that were advertised. We won't be returning - we'll just continue to go to Queen Park instead."}
{"text":"I came here on Taco Tuesday and was happy to know that they had $5 margaritas and $4 shrimp quesadillas. That's what's up right? So peep game to this. I told sis I wanted the shrimp quesadillas and asked how many came all together. She told me that it was $4 per quesadillas. At this point every single pearl that was draped around my neck was being clutched. Those words \"$4 per quesadillas\" ...It didn't make any sense to me. But wait a minute.. on the regular menu they have shrimp quesadillas for $10. Four shrimp quesadillas come on the plate (actually it didn't get served on a plate). So now let's break down whats wrong with all this. 1)In one of my quesadillas I had A shrimp. Meaning there was only one shrimp in my quesadillas. 2) Why is there a specialty food  item that cost more than the regularly priced menu item? and 3) Why am I paying $10 for these quesadillas when they barely match the size of my Red Baron oven baked pizza slice?? #IssaSetup. Whoever posted that picture of the quesadillas on their review is damn lie and whole scandal because my food didn't look like that (Thank God for Google right?).  Overall the set up is nice and my drink was ok and the food was alright."}
{"text":"A large group of us came to Recess as part of a 30th birthday bar crawl and we had a blast. They took great care of us, kept the food and drinks coming and every staff member was super friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back for another good time."}
{"text":"We had quite the disappointing experience at Recess. We went around 6pm on a Friday. It was very quiet, probably only about 10 other people there. We inquired with thr bartender about buckets vs fishbowls and she gave us an extensive explanation that was clearly incorrect. She had no familiarity with the menu whatsoever. A group of three people ordered while we decided and we proceeded to watch the bartender fumble for a full 10 minutes to make these very simple drinks. She had to ask them multiple times what they had ordered.  There was so much confusion and it was taking far too long so we decided to leave. The owner came up to our cars and apologized, invited us to stay, and offered our drinks on the house. He said this bartender was gone and came back so she was getting used to it. Doesn't seem to explain her incompetence but fine, it was a generous offer. So we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks to be ready and finally they were. They were average, sweet cocktails. 

I appreciate the owner's attempt at professionalism but sadly no one seems to know what's going on at Recess. With so many other viable bar options in the area, I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Sat at our table for what felt like forever while staff sat on the couches near us on their phones. Finally served menus and left again for forever. Bartender finally addressed us and moved to the bar. He was cool but the food was TRASH. Spent $9 on half of a small quesadilla and $8 on two hard salmon tacos! Overall it was disappointing and I ended up giving my food to my cousin to eat which she only ate because she was intoxicated. 

Safe to say the only thing to do here is drink! They had great drink specials"}
{"text":"Cool concept. Recess is described as an alternative to the club scene. Recess is roomy, bright, and inviting.   There are a number of seating options to include long tables, love seats, high top tables and two bars with seating. To go along with the the game concept, there are a few card games placed throughout the space. Mostly everyone stayed inside with a few people taking advantage of the front patio. Looks like they're still working out some kinks so that folks can take advantage of the back seating area. 

The food menu is described to be Asian inspired tapas. The ahi tuna nachos are said to be their signature dish. My friend and I ordered the lemon pepper wings and the  chicken quesadilla. 

Wings-cooked well but finished with a wet lemon pepper sauce not a dry seasoning. The sauce tasted honey based. I wasn't wowed. The sauce could definitely use some tweaking. Other wing flavors offered,like The General and The Honey Siracha, may lend itself more appropriately to the honey which seems to the base for their wing sauces.

Quesadilla-good flavor. My only suggestion would be to cut the green peppers and onions the same size so that you can taste all ingredients equally.  The quesadilla came with a side of what looked to be a fruit salsa and guacamole. The fruit salsa was straight, could've used some acid and salt though. The guacamole definitely needed acid and salt. Red bell peppers were used instead of tomatoes. I tasted no garlic and saw no onion, both are essential to a banging guacamole!! I understand that food costs are real but I would suggest to rethink the guacamole recipe. 

Drinks-local brews from Blue Blaze, NoDa, Catawba , Lenny Boy, Birdsong, and Unknown along with your college favorites, Miller Lite and Bud Lite :). In addition to their Signature bucket drinks, six craft cocktails are offered. My friend and I ordered the Rum Punch-too sweet for me but a great idea for those who may not enjoy a good stiff drink. 

I'd visit again for the ahi nachos and a proper cocktail. I dig the concept and hope they continue to evolve."}
{"text":"I LOVED Recess it has such a great vibe and they have such a great/friendly staff!!! I had a rum bucket that had me feeling just right! They have great drink options, the food was delicious as well! They even had UNO which I haven't played in forever and once you get your drink on the competition is on, next up was Jenga!!! This bar is definitely unlike any other bars around CLT and it was so refreshing to try something new and fun!!! The new hot bar around!! I had to follow them on Instagram so I don't miss their specials!! 5 stars Recess y'all keep doing what you're doing!!!"}
{"text":"The food was decent; we ordered lemon pepper wings (good), quesadilla (fine), salmon tacos (amazing). The drinks could be improved. The buckets aren't great for sharing-too much ice so about the same size as a normal drink. 
The atmosphere has potential; wish there was an outside area for games because the lot is huge"}
{"text":"Really sad that this didn't work out. It's literally a five minute walk from our house and we would love to support a local bar, but maybe they're just not ready. Went on Friday for their \"grand opening\", sat at a table for 4-5 minutes before a server brought us some water and menus, first thing we noticed was how expensive everything seemed. $7 for fries, $8 house wine, $11 for wings, etc. We asked if there were drink specials, Nope. OK, whatever, it's Friday, maybe they've got specials the rest of the week (didn't look like it), so we ordered two local beers off the menu (both $7 BTW) and waited another 6-7 minutes while the server delivered some other food and drinks before coming back with a water refill and telling us they didn't have the beers we ordered in stock. At this point, we'd been here 15 minutes and hadn't gotten drinks. We bounced. We'll come back though and try again; would really like for this place to be successful but this was a bad start."}
{"text":"**update 9-31-17*** So it has now been one month since they have opened and I have returned five times since. I was hoping they just had to work out a few bugs, but unfortunately it has got worse. This place could be phenomenal, and I do not mean any disrespect, but the owner needs to bring in somebody with experience and get a bartender that knows how to bartend. The beer selection is terrible, they have almost no wine selection, and very little alcohol choices. I ordered my first beer of the evening and they handed me a can that was all dented up and the rim was completely caved in, and they actually served it to me that way. I wish I could post a picture of it on this review. By looking at the crowd size in there the last three times I've been there, I can tell I am not the only one that is disappointed. I hope the owner takes this constructive criticism to hurry up and turn the place around and make it what has the potential to be.        

**opening night** They have the potential to be five stars, so I will revisit them again and give them a second chance to get a perfect rating. I happen to go on opening day and unfortunately they were out of a lot of food, and they didn't have draft beer yet. They had a few little hiccups to work out yet, but I think they can get there. They definitely need blue cheese for their wings!!! They also need some music for the outside patio. Prices were a little high for the atmosphere and what you get, hopefully they decide to lower their food and drink prices by a dollar or two."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday to check it out after seeing all the hype and advertisements. I was really excited thinking it was going to be something different but honesty it was no different then some of the breweries that have a bunch of games. I give this a blah rating, they need to step up the game options. The food is pricy too. I saw online they were supposed to have flat breads but when we got there we didn't see any on the menu."}
{"text":"We scheduled a birthday event with these guys and they decided to close the establishment an hour before our event started.  The employees were even outside trying to get in because they didn't even know the place was closed.  We paid the a deposit and we had to scramble to find another place to have a good time.

I've never had such an unprofessional experience in my life...and it's crazy because I'm big on giving back to local businesses.

Don't expect them to stay open too much longer.  They're obviously not concerned about keeping their patrons.  Beware!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Recess with a group of friends on a Friday and had a great time. The food was delicious and environment was super cool. We enjoyed the music and had fun playing games / doing activities throughout the night. 

I read a few bad reviews about the staff on here and had the complete opposite experience. I was greeted immediately after arriving and the staff paid close attention to our group. We never had to wait for a drink and the food service was pleasant. 

The only thing I'd want to see is better use of the outdoor space. I know this spot recently opened/they'll probably improve, but I could see some really cool uses (fire pit, etc.). 

As someone who is sick of the Charlotte club scene, I could easily see myself routinely going back to Recess as a Friday/Saturday night alternative. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really had high hopes but left truly disappointed. Wasn't greeted by any staff when I came in. It seems to be a mingle and seat yourself kind of spot. It wasn't busy so there was plenty of seating. Not sure if the people walking around with \"Recess\" shirts do anything or not because the whole time I was there I was not once asked if I needed or wanted anything. I ended up going to the bar myself and getting a drink. The rum punch $12, definitely didn't pack enough punch. It was cute the way they put it in the bucket though. After I finished my drink I left. The late night menu leaves much to be desired, I didn't get any food because I wasn't going to ask someone about how to place an order. Hopefully the service and menu selection improve."}
{"text":"I spent a Friday night at Recess for a friend's birthday.  We had a WONDERFUL time!  I think Recess brings CLT nightlife a new twist.  The tuna nachos were great, and the vibe was perfect. Groups of people were gathered playing different games. Cards Against Humanity, Janga, cornhole, etc... we ordered a gin bucket that was delicious too.  I would recommend this bar to any of my friends visiting CLT.  It is great, all around! Check it out."}
{"text":"Dope concept...adult playground, has this fun and friendly vibe. In an area where there isn't much around. Opening weekend I had to step in and check it out. 

Ordered the General Tso chicken wings as the bartender, who was super nice, recommendrd them. Service was very slow, especially considering there were only 3 of us ordering. It's cool, I'm patient, they haven't been open long. But the food came and the wings were like lukewarm and itty bitty. Good sauce, bad execution. Fried kale...it was cool. 

One issue though... glanced at the sides on the menu. French fries $7. I didn't even bother ordering b/c who is ordering $7 french fries??? Lol. I'll go back to hang & grab some drinks..... but...ehh..."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and had very high hopes! I was disappointed seems like the staff is ALL completely new. This may be a chill place to go have a drink and mingle, but food was over priced for what we ordered. In addition, my boyfriend and I were the only ones that seemed to be ordering food and the kitchen it took almost 30 mins for wings and fries. The best thing is the server had a good personality but, lacked experience. Management did try to compensate for our food taking for ever. Maybe in a little while I will go back and review again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday  night and it was during an event. The venue itself is a dope concept and the rum buckets are amazing, especially for the price. Their food is great and the dj was amazing! I wish they advertised more, bc this is a great spot to come to especially when it gets warmer!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last Saturday evening and although there were not many people in there, that made my time with my best friend that much more fun! 

The music selection was great! 
They have a new female cook there and she's AMAZING! Her personality is great and her buns are huge lol! 

I heard Karaoke is Tuesday nights! I can't wait to give it a try! I may be there tonight! 

Wink wink!"}
{"text":"i will never go here again!! false advertising!! their website says half off drinks and wings on wednesdays.  upon our server taking our order, she informed us everything was 50% off as well. the food was mediocre.  the drinks were not that great either. after we ask for the check, we realize 50% was only taken off the drinks. we asked why and she proceeded tell us the wings weren't 50% off like she said, nor the website (which we showed them). we ask for a manager (which was no where to be found), so the guy comes from the kitchen and tells us the 50% off wings special ended the previous week.  we had never been there and that was the only reason we went there.  i asked...\"how are customers supposed to know what they have changed with the incorrect information on their site??\" no answer was given. i have never been to an establishment that wouldn't honor their advertisement as listed! i will never attend this place again!!  the longer we sat there, the more undesirables entered the establishment as well. don't waste your time people and don't believe their website neither. i wouldn't give them one star if i wasn't required to. smh?"}
{"text":"I was excited to visit but when we entered no one greeted us, which wasn't a big deal. We sat a table for over five minutes, two waiters walked by and none of them even acknowledged us (they weren't really busy). One of them looked us straight in the eye and just looked away. We never were able to order food because we weren't given a menu or any type of directions on what to do. I'm sure the food is tasty but the service is a big NO for me. The staff makes the experience, and this one wasn't a good experience for me."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed by Recess when I went this past Saturday night. It's such a cool concept with a lot of potential, but they're just not reaching it.

There are tons of bars in Charlotte, and I thought this one would stand out with its \"adult playground\" theme. Unfortunately, I've seen more games at pretty much every brewery in town. There was a cornhole set, table shuffleboard, and a handful of board games. So disappointing!! I was definitely hoping for some more games and something that I hadn't seen before.

The style inside is really light and inviting, which I like. Drinks are pretty standard with lots of local brews. Come on Recess, kick it up a notch with the games!!"}
{"text":"The place is pretty cool for adults. I went there with some friends on a Saturday evening. No wait. Not many people were there. The atmosphere was real dope and laid back. The staff was very nice. Our servicer was Brittany. She was nice and very pleasant. There was another gentleman that was always near to help but I didn't catch his name. We order the lemon pepper wings (2 orders) which was $11 dollars. They were amazing and full of flavor. We also had the grilled shrimp tacos ($10 I think - they were a little salty). Ohh the truffle fries ($7) was blah. Not enough truffle oil and too much cheese. Drinks wise we had a punch bowl ($12) and a few glasses of wine($7 each). As far as pricing I think for the portions it's a little pricey. Maybe come down about $2-$3 dollars. The drink menu is pricy as well. The games were cute and fun. We did play corn hole until it got dark. If they had an outside light on top of the hill we would have played longer. The picnic area was nice. Overall I would go back. 



Suggestions: Add a fire-pit to the concert patio up on the hill. With a few chairs. Maybe add a Bluetooth system (so your customers can hook up their phones)to play music outside. A few board games for adults would work as well. 


See you guys soon!"}
{"text":"Cool new little spot.  It wasn't busy when we decided to check it out, which was great because we were all starved! We ordered the Poke nachos...it was delicious and you should order that too!  I had salmon tacos as my meal and they were very yummy.  My only negative feedback is that I felt our waitress tried to take a bigger tip than we intended her to do.  She was about 10 dollars short on the return change.  So either she needs another math lesson or a trip down the ethics and morals path.  She acted really weird when we asked why our change was so off. We'll give her the benefit of the doubt but seriously....get her trained in counting change.  I won't be paying with cash anytime soon. They have shuffle board and giant jenga, so there is plenty to do with everyone!!"}
{"text":"I don't think that I can really take this place seriously. I was in town for my friend's birthday and we (myself and two other guys) decided to check out some different bars in Charlotte, to get away from Uptown.  He had heard good things about this place and it's concept and it appeared to be \"for the culture.\"  It kind of reminds me of one clubhouses that each of the university city student apartment complexes had back when I was in school here.  Upon entering it seemed as though the group of people that were there were really enjoying themselves, some sorority and fraternity types sipping and playing a couple of the games.  Seemed fine enough. We went to the bar where I was going to buy the first round.  The bar is rather small and there are no taps even though I feel like the website says that there are.  Maybe they were down that day? Who knows?! I didn't see signs of them.  The beer selection that was there wasn't very appeasing to me, Bud Light, Miller, meh...give me a whiskey and ginger ale. The bartender hands me little kid's plastic water cup with ice a half shot of whiskey and ginger ale.  Is this what people come for?! I'm here now so why not make the most of it. I order just a straight Hennessy neat and it's another half shot in the bottom of said kid's plastic water cup.  I ask her to double it up...smh...the sadness continues.  Long story short I, as well as my party were over it.  Needless to say, we headed towards Uptown.  The space is large, and interestingly arranged. Seating at the bar is for the regulars and bartender's friends.  The food didn't look appetizing enough although we were kind of hungry. According to some other reviews, we dodged a bullet on that.  To sum up this place, it's as someone else said, this place has a lot of unrealized potential."}
