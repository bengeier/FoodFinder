{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! Friendly and attentive bartender, good food, and very reasonably priced drinks. What else can you ask for? The regulars are pretty friendly and entertaining, too. My top pick every time I need to catch a football game."}
{"text":"Britni was awesome. Great wings - Good people!  This is cool spot if you are staying by the airport and looking to get out of the hotel."}
{"text":"Great bar, love the atmosphere, Brittney is great all in all I will be back. You can play all the songs you want on the jukebox."}
{"text":"I had the chili experience.  The owner makes it himself.  My bartender packaged it to for me. It included a side of onions...cheese and crackers. Yummy."}
{"text":"Great little place.   Simple, comfy, low-key, great prices.   Lots of TV's to watch lots of sports.   I was on the way from Scottsdale to the airport, was thirsty, and saw this place. Glad I stopped in"}
{"text":"I had such a great time here, it's so laid back and chill. I had an amazing bartender named Andi who was nothing less than perfect! If you get her as a server, tip well!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a four star because its just a great dive bar... Our bartender was Britni and she was wonderful very attentive and made some good drinks probably one of the best Bloody Marys I have tried... They soak the pickles in Sriracha watch out for the Heat... Really good place to come and hang out for a bit to watch March Madness! I've been here many times before but I feel like this visit was one of my best... Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Love Gypsy's! We have been coming here for several years and the name has changed a few times.   Remodeled kitchen with a full menu. A dozen or so tvs with the NFL and MLB package to catch all the games. Good food, great drink prices,  fun bartenders and owners, and a neighborhood atmosphere."}
{"text":"The outside was a little deceiving. Outside didn't look like much but the inside was pretty decent. Large area with lots of seating and shuffle board. Bathroom is small but that's OK. The owner came to our table and introduced herself and checked on us so I thought that was pretty cool. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great clean friendly bar.  Food is great and so is service.  Had the Philly incredible.  The owner comes out and talks and asks how things are  really enjoy this place"}
{"text":"Gypsies is a great bar. Everyone is chill. People who don't like it are whiners"}
{"text":"Visiting the Phoenix area with my husband and decided to try this place out. They had karaoke going for their Friday night. They had a HUGE shuffleboard, pool tables, darts, and lots of tvs. We both loved the place and are probably going to go back tomorrow. The service was great. As my husband took his last sip of his beer, the bartender was already ready to get him another. Would definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Super chill place. We went on a weeknight so it was pretty empty. The bartender was super cool and so was the owner. He asked us how we heard about the place and then bought my fianc√©e and I another round in return"}
{"text":"Probably the worst bartender ever. Super rude. Because she didn't kno or understand wat I wanted.   Was gonna refuse to serve me.   Been coming here for years. Luv bill and Gypsy's. But this day btender needs to go.  Called me rude. Really !!!!"}
{"text":"If you hate the smell of cigarette smoke Do Not come here. Typical dive bar and casual vibe which I enjoy, but the people that smoke do so right outside bar doors and smoke comes right into bar. If you can handle the smell of smoke and typical fried bar food, cheap happy hour beer you will be fine here. For me as a none smoker just wish smokers weren't so lazy and could walk around corner of building."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place great staff fun environment good food. Enjoyable visit and nice clean place"}
{"text":"This place was a nice stop in for a drink when we got in town late. Late menu was all they had at 845 so we just had a drink and moved on.  Bartender was nice and helpful. Not a place for kids and probably gets a little rough at times I imagine"}
{"text":"Gave the place 2 starts but probably is closer to 1 or 1.5 stars.   Not sure where the name \"gypsy' comes from.  nothing bohemian or avante garde about this place.   basically a hang-out for drunks and flat-liners.  difficult to follow march madness due to the constant shouting, loud music, unpleasant odor and poor service.     Noticed an odd 'orange-reddish' stain on the window.  somebody must have objected to the appetizers and tossed a 3 pointer from the bar."}
{"text":"I must of hit Gypys's at the wrong time as what appeared to be a cozy roadside bar didn't do it for me. It wasn't the bar itself it was the service. And I'm not picky and expecting attention. I got my beer quickly but after that I might as well been a spot of grease on the bar. The two girls working the bar seemed more interested in chatting between themselves and with a few regulars at the bar. I was going to ask for a menu for future reference but never made enough  contact to pursue the effort. I finished my beer and left.  Again I don't expect that much but poor service or indifference bothers me. And in this case the service was indifferent. I'm in Scottsdale for a few weeks and trying out some bars while here. When there's so much to offer here. Why would I go back?   Sorry but first impressions mean a lot."}
{"text":"Cheap strong drinks food is good for a dive bar friendly service typical dive bar+hhhcxcvvccvggggghhgfghhg"}
