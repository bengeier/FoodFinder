{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Reasonably priced and everything we ordered was exceptional. A great evening."}
{"text":"Shared, tapas style plates might be old news downtown, but a welcome alternative in sleepy Etobicoke.

Went on a Tuesday night and it was surprisingly busy with families and couples of all ages. My brother lives in the area and tells me it's pretty packed Thursday-Saturday with a fun, youngish crowd.

The plates cover all the bases; veg, pasta, meats, seafood and are interesting without being daring or risky. Who doesn't like a nice bit of Montreal Smoked meat? Or a fish taco? Or a charcuterie plate with Prosciutto and Asiago? 

It's a nice room full of big B&W prints of old family gatherings, flattering lighting and  comfy booths. The front of house team is sociable and chatty, and, combined with the room and art, makes it less like dinner at  \"Nonaa's\" and more like an Izakaya run by your cool \"Zia\"."}
{"text":"Dinner and drinks in the neighbourhood . Mark is always on the move yet he  always makes you feel welcomed when you enter . Very busy night with locals and Jay's' fans in abundance . Service was good considering the crowd. As always, an excellent mint basil
Mojito to begin. We had some of our favourites including spicy shrimp tacos-so good and hard to share; lamb sliders and a new fav calamari puttanesca. Friends also had samosas, huge smoked meat sandwiches -not my thing but the guys loved them, and the tuna special ( very very spicy)! The last ones there but no one hurried us out . Ended the night with Sambuca and Limincello shots with Mark. A consistently great evening for all of us !"}
{"text":"Although it is a little pricey it is still well worth coming here. The food comes Tapa style in small portions and you order many different items to share. We have been here three times now and have been pleased each time. You will need a reservation since they always seem to be busy."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very clean. The decor was lovely. The serve was polite nothing exceptional about her service worth mentioning. The beef carpaccio was pretty good. The bacon wrapped scallops were nice. Overall it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Excellent local restaurant in the Kingsway strip. Tables are bit close together, but the food is very good (love the small portions for sharing, especially the pulled pork sliders!), and the service is friendly and accommodating. 

Only criticism (if any) is that the TV screens at the front take away from the ambiance."}
{"text":"Talk about accommodating! We arrived without a reservation and even though it was a zoo the hostess got creative and found us a nice table (still, next time I'll be sure to book ahead - wouldn't try this again). 

Food is super good! They recently updated the menu and although excited about some new stuff, I really miss the jerky rib strips that are the reason I came here in the first place.  Five solid stars."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now so it's time to review.  Live in the area, and this place has replaced the previous steak place that was here a little over a year ago.  Right from the start, it seemed to always be packed EVERY day of the week (which is a good sign because if you know the Kingsway strip area of Bloor, every second place is a restaurant.  Parking is hard to find here so you are either going to have to park on a back street or pay for parking near Royal York station but that is just the nature of the area and can't be avoided.

I love that there is NOTHING like this resto in Etobicoke.  I feel like one of the reasons it is getting such well-deserved business is because Etobicoke's restaurant scene has been kind of stagnant for a while now, and this place reminds me of something I would find in a trendy, more gentrified area of Toronto or downtown.  Etobicoke has slowly become same old Italian restaurant after diner after pizza place after greek place after burger place with nothing really new or super interesting.  Azaria's is a trendy, new and welcome addition that would appeal to younger 20 something's like myself, urban professionals, older people and families.  Everyone seems to eat here and love it and no one looks out of place dining here, the atmosphere is so lively.

Bacially, Azaria's is a tapas concept type of restaurant (spanish cuisine which is basically several courses of different types of appetizers or small dishes) however the cuisine here is not spanish, rather a mix and fusion of different cultures and flavours and you can go around the world in a meal.  Standouts are the chicken tikka/cucumber raita, peruvian ceviche (OMG THIS IS A MUST TRY), montreal smoked meat sliders (these are awesome), beef carpaccio, blackened catfish and spicy fried shrimp tacos, and beef tenderloin but there are many others.  I just love the small dish concept and you can order in any order you want, try different things, share, be experimental, and it really lets you pace yourself throughout a meal.  Both times I have been with 2 other people and 7-9 different dishes seemed to be an average of what we ate.  Not one dish has yet been a dud and I love the experience of getting different things in a meal every time.  Let me just say that Azarias in my opinion would be a PERFECT place to take a first date (I know I would love it!!!) because the atmosphere is lively, novelty of trying new dishes (which can give you something to discuss if it is a first date), and space between dishes coming out gives a chance to talk.  Seriously, this place would be awesome for a first date.

The wine list is pretty great too and offers great descriptions of each wine.  Our waitresses have been extremely friendly each time. AND omg, I need to mention the signature drinks here....I am a wine person always but the drinks here are great.  They change rather frequently too but so far I have tried the cucumber gin lemonde and a cherry vanilla fizz type drink and they were soooo good.  I also just want to mention that one time when my dad called to book a reservation he got called back by the owner himself who was super friendly.  Also, there is what I believe to be a manager named Mark who I have heard is super friendly and both times I was there he was running EVERYWHERE, working hard, checking on people. so A+ for customer service.  This place can get a bit expensive but so far I have loved the experiences here and highly recommend if you are looking for a new place in good old Etobs, especially for a first date, catching up or going out with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I went to Azarias a couple of days ago for a long overdo girls night. Both my friend and I were excited to try the food, as the menu looked amazing and super delicious and the past reviews seemed to be good. The restaurant is a little small, and I was disappointment that the serve told me that she could not give me a booth seat after I requested it, but gave me a small table. However the atmosphere is really nice, soft music, and I loved that each table had a fresh basil plant that you could eat from. 
This restaurant serves 'tapas' style food- which are small plates meant for sharing. For the price of the plates, I don't think the food was really worth it. My friend and I shared 4 plates- 1)their spicy shrimp tacos (3 tacos to a plate)- they were ok, shrimp battered with coleslaw, the only thing 'spicy' about it was the dash of frank red hot sauce they put on top of it 2) beet and goat cheese salad- not impressive at all, fair size but the beets lacked any taste and the I found the salad to be a little dull 3) lamb burgers (2 burgers to a plate)-found the topping to be good, but the burger itself to be dry 4) the cheese and meat board- very very little cheese for what you are playing and a couple of small cut up pickles, the only good thing about this board was the spicy salami. 
The cheapest 8oz of wine was $12, and I don't think I got my full 8oz and def wouldn't pay that price again for such a small portion of wine- I've been to fancier restaurants where the wine list is more affordable. 
Overall we had a great night catching up, and glad we tried the restaurant, but I really don't think I will ever go back there, nothing to me was outstanding. However I will say, the the presntation of the food was always good.
Fyi- the couple beside us ordered the fries and bacon scallops which looked and smelled amazing! Maybe the things we ordered weren't the best the day we went :(

{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to go to just enjoy amazing food, drink some wine and chill. I couldn't believe how close it was to our house when I first found it on Yelp and gave it a try. This place blew my mind the first time, and never disappointed me since and I doubt it ever will. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Judging by the name, I was expecting Greek and I scoped out the menu online.  It's tapas style but the menu is all over the place so I was a bit leery about how good the food would be.  I was pleasantly surprised to find an eclectic and varied selection of dishes to enjoy.  Every single thing we ordered at our table was delicious.  The service was good.  The owner/host was hustling around to help clear tables and get arriving customers seated as quickly as possible.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is such a lovely restaurant. Every dish was divine and the servers were all super helpful and cheerful. Our wine glasses were never left empty, even on a very busy Saturday night. We especially enjoyed the evening's specials, which included jumbo shrimp and risotto and snap peas with prosciutto. Yum. I'm looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Solid first experience at Azarias! We enjoyed the cheese fondue (a little much for two people - perfect for a group of three or four), frites, sweet and spicy dried pork strips, and truffled mushroom risotto. Somehow we still had room for dessert, so we split the tiramisu (which was delicious - nice and light). It was really loud so not ideal for a romantic date night, but certainly a lot of fun. Service was attentive, but not too intrusive. We'll be back at some point I'm sure :)"}
{"text":"Great food, cocktails, ambiance and service.  The place was booked when we called ahead for reservations last night, but as things always work out for us, we were able to snag 2 seats at the bar immediately after walking in despite it being super packed and busy (a couple was getting ready to leave their bar stools within a minute after we arrived).  Score!  We ordered a dozen oysters, poutine, the mushroom truffle risotto, and a couple of old-fashioneds/cocktails each.  The bartender and owner were awesome.  We enjoyed all of our delicious dishes and drinks, and had a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"This was our first meal in Canada and will be one of the most memorable meals ever!  It had it all: the food was phenomenal, and it had a lovely ambience along with very, very hospitable servers. We were the last customers and the meal turned into an energizing conversation. Coming back again for sure. This is a restaurant that can't be missed!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was recommended to us after we finished dress shopping just down the block. When we stepped in the door the owner greeted us very warmly. He explained not only the menu concept but also or options for seating and the volume we'd find in each section. 

We sat in the back section and immediately were charmed by the little pot of herbs and scissors - fresh thyme in our olive oil was great. We ordered the smoked salmon latkes and the arugula salad to start. Both were really really tasty. We loved the style of service with dishes coming out as they're ready. 

For our mains we shared the short rib special, the bacon seated scallops and the cauliflower leek smash with corn.  Omg good to all of the above; presentation, plating, taste, quality... We were blown away!

We live pretty far away but I know I'll be back - and not just when I have dress fittings!

Dinner for two with two glasses of prosseco was $75 which felt completely reasonable."}
{"text":"Wonderful way we were greeted at the front by the Manager, so welcoming. He made us feel so at home. Seated and had wonderful red and white wine. Tried the ceviche, poutine, bacon shrimp skewers, and oysters. This place is the ultimate aphrodisiac! It was filled with friends, couples and parties. Great place. I would highly recommend for a first date. Small tapas. Excellent. Well done to the owner!"}
{"text":"Looked on Yelp and decided to try this place after reading the reviews. My cousin and I came to Toronto for a trade show, and wanted to try some good food but not have to go to Downtown Toronto. Great choice! Food was amazing and the service to match. The idea is to share everything so if you go I suggest going with someone that has similar taste as yourself. We got the Poutine Fries (first timers in Canada - we had to), we probably wouldn't get them again, we're not big French fry lovers. We then got Brussel Sprouts (AHH-MAZING) I believe in the description it also listed tomatoes with the brussel sprouts but none on the plate, no biggie, tomato is the one thing I won't eat. We also ordered the beet and goat cheese salad and peppercorn tenderloin(I think) both delicious! 

To say the least my cousin and I were shocked at how delicious the food was. Our first time being to Canada we had rather low expectations (sorry) but this has definitely changed our minds. 

Oh, we also ordered a dessert and a dessert coffee. Turtle cake and Tiramisu Coffee, again, both delicious. Only thing, we should've asked for decaf coffee, but that was our fault. 

Side note, super cute basil plants  with scissors to add to your meal if needed."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to venture to the west end to try a new restaurant and chose Azarias due to its high rating. We called to make a reservation and was told seating would either be at 6:30pm or 8:30pm along with a credit card. When we called back, we were lucky enough to get a 7:30pm slot with no credit card necessary.

When we first walked in the place had a modern cool vibe and was fairly busy already on a Friday night. The crowd was more of a mixture of couples or groups of friends from early 20s to early 50s. The restaurant is tapas style so our group of six decided to share and selected 3-4 options each. 

Food (4/5)
The menu is fairly extensive and has a fairly wide selection. We honestly ordered a lot of food and this review would be way too long if I delved into each one. My favourite items of the night were the brussel sprouts, grilled calamari, seared scallops, and mussels with tomato and wine broth. An honourable mention does go to the seared ahi tuna as it was made perfectly but the apple slaw and wasabi cream just didn't wow me. Least favourite items of the night were the Thai lemongrass mussels, charcuterie board and truffled mushroom risotto. The lemongrass sauce for the mussels was underwhelming and the sauce thickened too much after the dish cooled. The charcuterie board was okay but for the price i definitely expected a less basic selection of meat and cheese. The truffled mushroom risotto was a little salty, didn't have too much truffle flavour and flat out didn't look appetizing.

Service (4/5)
From the moment we walked in the hostess greater us with a smile and was beyond friendly. She took the time to explain the menu and answer any of our questions. The server was also very pleasant and always noticed right away if our glasses needed to be refilled or our bread basket was empty. 

Overall the place is definitely a great gem we found. The food was delicious but was honestly a little overpriced for the portion size. I also wanted to mention that each table has a rosemary plant which guests can trim and add it fresh to the olive oil which is a nice touch. I would definitely go back again to try more dishes."}
{"text":"We showed up at Azaria due to the great reviews on Yelp.

The 4 of us were seated quickly and had no problems fitting right in.

The crowd here was a mix of business meetings , friends and people on dates .

On the tables were live cut your own Rosemary and Basil . Fantastic.

We ordered :

Truffle mushroom risotto 
Spicy scrimp taco
Montreal smoked meat sliders

Cheese fondue 
sausage
Apples 
Salami

Penne regata
Meatball sliders 

This might seem like quite a bit for 4 people but it really wasn't. Every thing came out appetizer sized and we shared. 

The tables general opinion of the food ranged from \"amazing\" to \"good ...but not as the amazing sliders\"

My favorite was their Montreal smoked meat slider (as you've probably infererred)

I've had smoked meat sandwiches in famous delis in Las Vegas , Montreal and New York and I can honestly say these little sliders hold their own among the worlds best.

Mounds of smoked meat on tasty little slider buns . I was in heaven .

Their fried shrimp sliders were also quite good . Wrapped in a soft tortilla the thumb sized fried shrimp were a nice crunchy comparison .

The only disappointment was the inhouse dessert.

It was an old tiramisu . I don't know when it was made but definitely not fresh.

With a beer my portion $35 . Pretty solid for what I got .

Why 4 stars ?
Azaria has amazing food.
Fantastic selection .
Nice atmosphere .
Good value for money .

Why not 5 stars?
Weak dessert 
staff were only so so (they really didn't know much about the food )"}
{"text":"This was a tough one for me - a toss between a three or four star, but overall, for a West-end neighborhood, local jaunt, this becomes a four star.

Azarias is a tapas-style restaurant, and the vibe was happening. Pictures of the owners line the walls, and they have great booth seating here. 

As for the food, our table started off with a variety of tacos, which IMO, wasn't that great. I have had better tacos (like at Union Social Eatery!). The shrimp taco was disappointing as it was dry and all you could eat was the batter. The beef tacos were mildly better as it was kind of the drier side as well. The tuna tacos were the best. My husband commented that perhaps the tacos weren't saucy enough for me, so valid point.

The mains (which you can share) were better. Shortrib and Risotto were all yum.

Wine selections are decent and decently priced, and even though I didn't have any, the cocktail list was pretty inventive.

Service was sublime. Our waiter was engaging, made sure we were never without food or wine, and was all smiles.

In the end, this was a great place for a Friday night dinner. When we left, there was a group of bachelorette's coming to celebrate so Azarias definitely can be a romantic place or a night out on the town. While the food wasn't out of this world, I would come back for the overall ambiance."}
{"text":"What a find! Tapas meets Italian meets Bar food is the perfect way to describe this restaurant. Everything on the menu is small and shareable, tapas style. But the food is absolutely exquisite and well thought out. We had a bit of everything, from the beet salad to the truffle mushroom risotto to oysters to short ribs. I can't recommend one thing because they were all so equally amazing. 

My only suggestion to this place is to expand at some point, albeit it is a new restaurant. The tables are in close proximity to one another; you're practically sitting right next to a stranger which was a little awkward. 

Oh and did I mention each table had a miniature pot growing either basil leaves or rosemary that you can cut and put in your food? 

Overall comment: one of a kind, a definite recommend."}
{"text":"I surprised my boyfriend with a semi-romantic dinner, and this spot did me solid. 

Dimly lit and quaint (though we came kind of late and on a Monday), we definitely got a one-on-one feel. The tapas style was great for sharing and we enjoyed each of our plates. The desserts were okay, but not special. Our waitress was also eager to help us and made conversation as the night went along. I mentioned I was going to Montreal and she said she was from there and gave me a few (good!) food recommendations. 

Not quite 5 stars - the total bill for two with desserts ended up near $100 and if I'm splurging that much on a date, I feel like the food would have to be heavenly to get that fifth star."}
{"text":"A very good example of a very bad restaurant

Staff are very rude.
Price is extremely high. You have to pay almost 20$ for just a simple salad. 
Portions are very very small."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best tapas restaurants in the city with an amazing wine list. Nice ambiance, great food , great service! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! Incredible atmosphere, good beer selection on tap and fabulous food! We had the lamb and Montreal smoked meat sliders and they were to die for!  Also had the hot & spicy dry pork strips and wow!!! I have never seen these anywhere before and they are like wings but healthier and tastier! Would highly recommend checking this place out if you like great food! They also have some great options for the veggie lovers."}
{"text":"Just visited this weekend and discovered it's been open for less than a month! What can I say....amazing and impressive!  From atmosphere, to food, to price, to staff: the experience was well worth the gamble of stumbling upon this charming spot on a whim. When my guest and I spoke with an employee, he described the menu as shareable plates. We ordered: beet salad with mixed greens and goat cheese; shrimp tacos with jalapeno; bacon seared scallops; Montreal smoked meat sliders and poutine. Everything was well cooked, presented really well and tasted wonderful.  Hope to visit again soon!!"}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner and will definitely return. Great selection of tappas-- really large portions for tappas BTW-- tasty food, reasonable prices, great service. 

We had:

Montreal smoked meat sliders - 5/5 there are 2 in an order. Each slider has 7 or more thick slices of smoked meat. Very tasty. 

Blackened cat fish tacos - 3/5 3 in an order. A bit too much lettuce for my liking, but the fish was quite nice. 

sea salt frites - 5/5 can't go wrong with this!

Brussel sprouts - 5/5 - YUM! they come with sundries tomato and bacon!

Chicken spring roll special- 4/5 these were delicious but larger than I expected. Like massive. 6 halves of plump spring rolls. 

Ahi tuna special - 5/5 another massive portion. Well seasoned and perfectly seared. 

I recommend coming here with a group of 4 or more so you can order a bunch of dishes without getting too full. Last night we were just 2 people and we weren't able to finish it all. We didn't even have room for desert. 

Azarias is one of the best restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Just LOVE this place!

It's the perfect night out for the girls or with couples!  Everything is amazing.  Love the gin cocktail with cucumber (from a committed wine drinker it's a big thing for me to switch).

The ambiance, decor, food quality/variety, service, cleanliness is superior!

Runs to a costly night.  But I'd be shocked if you came away with any regrets.  Definitely worth it!  It's just so hard to deny yourself will all the yummy options!  So don't!

I would always make a reservation for a large group.  But we've been lucky with spur of the moment drop-ins also!

Never rushed.  A place to enjoy, relax and laugh!

Love it!"}
{"text":"Great food --- great service. The only problem: deciding what to eat - sooo many choices!

By 6:30 on a Saturday night, this is the hottest spot in the area. So, if you're looking to visit on a Saturday night, consider booking ahead. Mark is the host, and he's great. Pleasure to talk to. And he knows when to leave you alone to enjoy your dinner. 

The food is terrific. Mostly small sharing plates so you can try lots of different things, but not everything - 'cause you won't be able to :)

Since you can't have everything, here are a few of our favourites from the other night: Kung Pao, beef tacos, smoked meat sliders, french fries (I know, but they're really good), beef tenderloin. There's always specials to keep it interesting. Bottom line, you won't have any trouble finding a range of items that will tickle your palate with every bite."}
{"text":"We were invited to dinner at this restaurant and were very please with the service and food. The owner and staff are very very friendly and welcoming.

The portions are pretty small for the price but they are delicious. Prices here are pretty high.. For you to walk away full you would have to order 2 dishes which is at least 30 dollars per person.

This is a great place for a special meal and occasion!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was lively and busy. We did go at 8:30pm on a Saturday night so we expected a wait but because it was just for two we got seated immediately.
We ordered :
- Bacon scallop (barely any bacon, scallop cooked to perfection)
- dozen malpeques oysters (fresh!)
- lobster tail (6 small tails, very very bland and tasteless)
- beef carpaccio (cheese on it was amazing however, it was just that. Beef arugula shitake mushroom and cheese. There was no sauce so it was also just bland)
-miso black cod (highlight of the dinner! Tender like butter, couldn't even stick my fork in it because it would just flake off. The skin was nice and crispy. Delicious! 
-tiramisu (amazing, strong expresso and so light and fluffy)

I gave this a three star because out of 6 dishes only 3 were good. Given that oysters, u can't really screw up. It was too bland for my taste, no seasoning. Even the bread given was just served with plain olive oil. The crowd are more mature. Paid 150$ for two people, two drinks. Red sangria was mediocre and the lychee watermelon martini tasted like drinking perfume. 

Maybe I'll come back another day and try different items."}
{"text":"Can't quite understand why this is rated so highly.  Agreed the ambiance is nice and modern and the restaurant appears to be very clean, but in terms of food, well it was just fine.  

Nothing great and nothing really stood out as a winner that would keep me coming back.  We had a group of 8, so lots of things to try, most was fine and a few things were subpar (ceviche mostly).  The shrimp tacos everyone here is raving about, they were fine, but basically some slaw and a heavily breaded and fried shrimp, hard to screw that up. Smoked meat slider, once again fairly simple dish.

I felt items were overpriced for what we got, but the pricing is in line with the hood.

I would go again if invited, but would not be the person inviting others to come here."}
{"text":"We came in on a saturday night to try out this tapas style restaurant. It was busy when we arrived so be sure to make a reservation ahead of time. The hostess, server and the restaurant manager were all super friendly. We were seated right away in the dining area. Very cute concept.. every table has either a pot of basil or thyme ready to be cut for the olive oil and bread. Our waitress was super helpful, explained to us that for 2 people 4 to 6 tapas is more than enough. The menu is organized very well from seafood to meats to salads to vegetarian items. We opted for 5 dishes: seafood gratin ( delicious! Lots of seafood in a gooeey cheesey bread crumblly shell plate.. thought portion size really is tapas do dont expect much!) Fondu + 3 ( hot italian sausage, salami and brocolli) this item was ok.. typical fondu made with swiss cheese. Will not reorder the next time around though; mushroom risotto (very delicious and creamy and not overly salty! Was a good touch to our meal); deep fried calmari and sausage ( typical calamari but it was fried to perfection and the sauce that came with it was really good .. i think marinara and olive inside?); lastly we ordered the butter chicken to end the meal... surprisingly to my indian hubby he quite enjoyed it! The chicken breast was smooth and the sauce was extra creamy and sweet with a small kick of spice. It was a great portion size and definitely worth a try! 

We ended our meal with the lava cake and that was impeccable with the gooey chocolate oozzing out. I cant wait to go back to try their other stuff on their menu!"}
{"text":"azarias is a tapas style food...we came trying to expand our places to go in etobicoke. we were pleasantly greeted by the staff and showed to our table. the place was fairly busy with family (kids) and couples.  we ordered beer and wine - a pretty good selection.  they gave us fresh bread which we had with olive oil and basil...there were herbs at each table in a small pot with scissors that you can cut off urself.  for dinner as it was tapas style we ordered a few dishes.  we tried the blackened catfish tacos - the fish was not seasoned that well and was quite dry...i've definitely eaten better fish tacos!  we tried the crab cakes as well - they were okay..not spectacular..again, ate better crab cakes elsewhere.  we then tried some meat - we had the short ribs with glazed carrots - the ribs were a bit dry but were quite flavourful.  for veggies we had rapini - we enjoyed it as it had roasted garlic and chili flakes - cooked perfectly.  sea salted fries were also pretty good!  i'm not sure if it was just what we chose to eat but may give it another try..."}
{"text":"Great food and service, highly recommend.  It's a jewel in the Kingsway.  Menu changes and I have only had wonderful time.  I do find it a little dark"}

We have been there a number of times and are happy to say that their amazing food and service is very consistent. The dishes always taste amazing and their staff are friendly. 
Our favourites are the shrimp tacos and the montreal smoked meat sliders.
Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"For a foodie that's been to LA, SF, Vegas, NYC and most recently DUBAI and Paris. I must say, this place has some insanely delicious food. Everything was great!! Maybe a little salt here and there but I'm no chef, it's just personal preference. Service was amazing, Mark was incredibly nice and our waitress Sasha was incredible well versed in the menu and gave us insightful recommendations and her service was awesome ! The entire staff was great AND they have incredible service and very hospitable. I live in the Bay Area of California, but this place will definitely be in my top 20."}
{"text":"A very solid 4 stars. I almost want to give it 5 stars just due to the fact that there isn't a huge selection of good food in this area. 

We came here because we had a group with ranging tastes, and this place has an interesting menu with a lot of different options across a variety of ethnicities of food.  Everything from Italian options like Chicken Piccata, Beef Tenderloin, various pastas, Canadian influenced things like Baby Back Ribs and Smoked Meat Sliders, all the way down to far eastern influences of Butter Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken.
The only thing on the menu over $20 is the caviar, which can be yours at the meager price of $150. Needless to say, we didn't eat any caviar, but we did try a lot of other things.

The foods are served tapas style in the sense that it's intended to be sharing plates, and there isn't much order as to how things come out, but I will say that everything we ordered came out incredibly quick. 
Our intended fondue starter, to our ribs, risotto, butter chicken, sea salt frites, salads, and everything else we ordered were brought to our table before we finished our first drink. Nothing disappointed either in terms of quality.  We did say we were fine with everything coming out as it was ready, but admittedly we didn't expect everything to come out so quickly.

Drink wise, they have a pretty large wine list, with 5oz glasses ranging in the $8-12 price point and bottles ranging in a massive scale from $35-260. Although for some reason not having a printed beer list, they do have a decent selection of beer on tap though as well, including craft favourites Beaus' Lug Tread, Longslice's Hopsta La Vista IPA along with a handful of bigger brewers like Sapporo and the Labatt's owned Mill Street Organic. Beers were a reasonable $7 per pint. 

The ambiance is lovely, and the service was on point. Attentive but not overbearing.
All in all, a lovely meal enjoyed by all. Full recommended for anyone looking for a good meal in the Royal York stretch of Bloor."}
{"text":"We were a party of 8 and had a great booth. Owner came by to say hi, which is a nice touch. Server was very nice and efficient.  Good vibe.  Lights kept dimming down and brightening. Don't know if it's a glitch in their lighting or the electrical service, but it got a bit annoying. 

Most orders are ideal for 2 people, odd one is good for 3. 
1. Mushroom risotto - my favourite. I love risotto, order it all the time and here it's really good. 
2. Smoked meat sliders- really good. I don't even like smoked meat. Although I thought there was too much mustard in it. 
3. Spicy shrimp tacos - they are fried and really spicy. So ask for less sauce if your not into hot sauce
4. Short Ribs- very tender meat and very heavy dark sauce. So heavy tasting but very good. 
5. Lamb Mini burgers - really good if you like lamb
6. Cod cakes- comes with three. Good, but too much potato and not enough cod. 
7. Beet + Goat cheese salad - not bad for a salad. Could use more dressing. 
8. Brussel sprouts - they were good, the bacon made it tasty."}
{"text":"Food was decent but service was lacking.

My wife & I went to Azarias two years ago and had a deliciously memorable meal. Unfortunately our return visit was memorable for a different reason.

We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 mains. Starting with Spicy Shrimp Tacos for me and Crab Cakes for my better half. the 3 tacos were decent if a little bland, the only spice seemed to be one line of hot sauce. The Crab Cakes were okay, but tasted like a combination of crab and tater tots.

Now before we could finish a single appetizer, our mains were brought out. We were at a tiny table with barely any room to place them. Not an apology or comment from our server, they were just placed on the table for us to watch cool down as we continued eating our apps. I know the place was busy and the kitchen needs to keep things moving, but this was ridiculous. 


These were not sharable tapas plates, they were main course meals. The Curry Goat special was delicious, just wish it had come out after my appetizer. The Short Ribs with Glazed Carrots is exactly what you get, a hunk of overly sweet beef and a few tiny carrots. No mention was made of the mostly untouched short ribs besides asking if we wanted them wrapped up. We did not, and probably won't return. Three stars for some of the food, two stars for the service."}
{"text":"We took my brother here for his birthday last month and absolutely loved this place!

The owner and his staff were very welcoming and even offered us the prime booth in the middle of the restaurant for the three of us celebrating our special occasion (thank you!).

I loved how they had fresh herbs, tiny scissors, and a little pot of olive oil at every table to DIY your own flavoured oil - such a simple but effective idea!

We ordered many little plates of items (the restaurant is like tapas style), including amazing oysters (served with three different sauces), crispy fish tacos, something very similar to beef jerky (but waaaaaaay better), and an super yummy beet/goat cheese salad.

Every dish was prepared with care and the flavours were awesome. The wine selection was awesome and they also had a range of craft beers on tap.

To top it all off they even surprised my brother with a birthday dessert and awkward singing, which made him smile. All in all, this was a wonderful experience and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Azarias for the first time a couple weeks ago.  We took our 10 year old niece for our monthly dinner with her.  The interior was a tad fancier than expected (we didn't feel dressed quite right), but that didn't matter.  It's such a warm, welcoming place. The staff were wonderful and the food was delicious.  We shared about 7 dishes, and only one was not to our liking.  It was a special for the day, so not on the regular menu.  Everything else was perfect.  Our niece got to try a few things for the first time (including cheese fondue, beef carpaccio and duck confit tacos) which was a lot of fun.  She also got to learn about why Rosemary is awesome, since there was a pot of it on our table with scissors to add to your olive oil. 

Will definitely be back soon - lots of yummy things left to try on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite go-to places in this neighborhood. The experience starts with the warm welcome you get at the door by the owner. Anytime I've been here the place has always been busy but the service has never been an issue. I love the small plates idea. It's great for people like me who love tasting various things and don't want to commit to one main course. I usually have or share the arugula salad, smoked salmon latkes, grilled asparagus and the fish or shrimp tacos. My friends have had the fondue and meat dishes as well and were quite happy with them. Everything has always been consistently good and they have a decent wine list to choose from too."}
{"text":"This is one of the best family /neighbourhood restaurants in Toronto.  Incredibly diverse menu of tapas (not just spanish).  Possibly the best Montreal Smoked meat in town and it's not even a deli.  Don't miss the short rib or fish tacos.  Service is above and beyond.  If I could give this place 6 stars I would.  Decor is modern but with old family photos of the owner. Reservations are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food.  Very creative.  I would go there again.  However, the waiter was very full of himself and not very interested in service.  During me giving him my order he actually turned around to talk to another staff member!  He still didn't ruin my experience this is why I gave it a 4.  My guest and I were quite intrigued by his actions.  It would have been a 5."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! And the service great with the owner Mark ensuring everyone is having a good time and enjoying the food. We were 2 of his first customers when he opened this place 2 years ago and now I know why we need to come more often!"}
{"text":"A begrudging two stars. Wine delivery screwup. Waiters running like racehorses..Flavourless risotto. Delicious oysters. Slop Brussels sprouts. Fries good.seafood mornay very good a la fifties
Carapacio drowned by accoutrements. Fair crowd. Etobicoke's best not so good."}
{"text":"Excellent tapas restaurant. Tasty and very delicious menu items and super service. Live the ambiance and will certainly return."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome food. Ordered several dishes from their tapas style menu. Tried smoked meat sliders, fish tacos, short ribs, and Brussels sprouts. All dishes were excellent. Also got the bread pudding to finish. Thought the prices were reasonable for the food offered. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Overall, i think this place is great for the neighborhood. 

They're just lacking a bit of refinement. In the service, and in the food. That's what will change them for being a good place to an exceptional one. They're almost there but are just missing the mark."}
{"text":"Came to Azarias for dinner last night with my family. I love the decor, the B&W photos on the walls are all from the 40's/50's (I'm guessing) of the owner's family. Lovely touch. 
We arrived at 8pm on a Saturday and it was PACKED..you'll have to speak up in this place but no matter, seating was cozy and not cramped. A little basil plant with scissors is on every table which was a cute touch!
We ordered a whole bunch of stuff:
-Summer greens salad
-Hot & Spicy house-baked dry pork strips
-Grilled lobster tails
-truffled mushroom risotto
-sauteed collard greens
-sea salted fries
-chocolate turtle cake
Everything except for the lobster tails was 5/5! The lobster tails were a little bland and dry. I want to come back and try the cauliflower & leek smash with roasted corn..mmm. 
Lovely choice on a street packed with awesome eats."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Came again today and the food, drink, and atmosphere were outstanding. Sylvia, my server, remembered my name from last time in, was engaged, pleasant, and helpful all night. She is a Rock Star!!!"}
{"text":"Very good tapas style restaurant.  Very busy on a Friday night, so we made reservations.  Really good service.  Beer and Goat cheese salad was very good.  Same with mushroom risotto, shrimp tacos, and Brussels sprouts.  The lamb mini burgers had a very strong flavour.

I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The manager is soo friendly and so is the staff. The pino gri is really great. We started off with the fondue which was great to share with the 2 other people I was with. The steak has to be possibly the best one I've had, it truely melts in your mouth! The fries were great, cooked perfectly! I'll definatly be back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and really like this place. Many many good dishes for sharing.  Wine list is good and not overpriced if you buy by the bottle. Other drinks and wine by the glass is a little pricey. 

Service is friendly and attentive. 

Overall I do enjoy coming here"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with great small dish options. Really fantastic are the seafood gratin, poutine, short ribs and smoked meat sliders. Nice options on the menu and just about everything we had hit the mark."}
{"text":"My names Mahar and i ordered food and it was fucking amazing  i loved the lava cake it is the best in town"}
{"text":"This place was excellent and we received excellent service from the time we walked in to the time we left (from who I presume was the owner). There was impeccable attention to detail and nice touches like fresh basil on the table. The shrimp tacos and grilled scallops made this restaurant for me. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and ambiance! If you like a fun night out sharing good food with good vibes, this is the place to go. The staff is incredibly welcoming and accomodating. The shrimp tacos and brussel sprouts are a definite favourite!"}
{"text":"After a little debate I've decided to give Azaria's the five stars. It seems like you can't go wrong regardless of what you decide to order. I haven't much experience with Tapas,  but can say this meal was a pleasure.

On the weekends definitely make a reservation, if you don't there's a little bar up front to sit while you wait. The seating is tight- you're going to have to speak up, it's almost awkward not to say anything to your neighbours.

There are herbs at each table that diners are encouraged to use on their food. Unfortunately we didn't realize this until we were leaving, but it's a nice little quirk that adds to the whole Tapas experience.

I'd detail on what we ordered, but like I said I firmly believe you'll be happy with whatever combination you chose to make up. Just grab a drink and enjoy."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! Impeccable service, great food, good cocktail list.
Crowd was an all ages mix of families, date nights and friends socials.
Make a reservation, it's a busy place. 
It's all tapas and it was recommended by our server to order 4-5 dishes for the two of us.
The favs were the short ribs and the beet & goat cheese salad. Delish!

Good ambiance but the tables are close together, so more of a fun atmosphere than romantic/ private.
They're so busy we felt a bit rushed, but overall the customer service was top notch."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.

1st time tonight on a recommendation of a friend.

Atmosphere: nice and hopping but tables are too close together.

Service: excellent! friendly manager and waitress. the food was made quickly and we ate slowly so our waitresss made sure to not rush us by holding the rest of our dishes back so we can take time to enjoy our meal. after the meal the manager came to check in on us to see how our first time was.

Food: tapas style. delicious! 5/5 for sure. Dishes we got were: 

oysters - so cheap! only 2$/oyster which is so cheap compared to rodneys or pearls diver. 

mushroom risotto was good but need more salt. 

smoked meat sliders was just ok, wouldnt order again.

shrimp tacos was sooooo goood! loved it!

my favorite by far was the beet and goat cheese salad and i dont even like beets....or salads.

scallops with bacon....drools. they cooked the scallops perfectly.

price: great for the quality. $100 for two with wine. 

definitely would return to try the other dishes and highly recommend!"}
