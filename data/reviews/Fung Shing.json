{"text":"Exellent food each time I eat there with colleagues or order for home. Their wonton soup are great, chow mein and special fried rice. On top of that, price is affordable."}
{"text":"Service wasn't very friendly, my old shoes were more tender than the meat we got there and my spicy beef with orange tasted alarmingly like pork with orange marmalade without any heat. There were some dried chilli peppers in it, but unless you actually ate the pepper there was no spice to be had. 
The interior was, to put it politely, well worn and undecorated.
With so many great restaurants in Montreal, I'd suggest trying a different one than this one."}
{"text":"Been coming to Montreal for many years on tour with rock bands etc... last time I stayed, I was in the chinatown based Holiday Select and had this just around the corner. Usually I try to stop here once or twice on tour but this time... i think it was 3 or 4 times. This is some of the best authentic chinese food you can find in Montreal but since its in a dark unassuming building (nearly could be called a hole in the wall) that you would probably walk right past it. I usually order off the menu. The crispy pan fried noodles I get with Duck and Chinese Mushrooms. You have to ask for it and they look at you funny because they forget they made it for you. Trust me... it is so good... and the sauce is not overly smoky or overly soyed... it is just brilliant. The Lobster Cantonese was so good with the black bean and egg sauce that I went back for it again the next day... get that with a side of shrimp fried rice and... just amazing. Beyond words. The wonton soup is a great start with little shrimp filled wontons, followed by fried dumplings. Cannot wait to tour here again"}
{"text":"Pros: Soup, Chicken Fried Rice were on spot. Large portions. 
Cons: General Tao, Beef Sesame too much batter, little portion of meat used."}
{"text":"I tried the won ton soup and found it bland. I make better won tons than that (and I don't use MSG either).

I also ordered the Braised Shrimp Balls that came on a bed of bamboo shoots and pork, but it wasn't amazing. I think it was \"okay\" Chinese food, but not what I was expecting.

Then I tried the salt and chili fried shrimps (spicy) for $10 and I AM HOOKED. I think this is the best dish of the whole lot. Delicious, great breading, flavourful.

The last dish is their \"famous\" Fung Shing Deep Fried Half Chicken.

Meh. It was okay. I'd rather go to Rotisserie Ramados for chicken, but it wasn't awful. You will definitely need to do a light dip into that salt to make it taste good.

Overall, an okay Chinese restaurant. I've had better, but then again, those chili fried shrimps (#210 on the list) were quite tasty."}
{"text":"excellents dumplings ! (surtout ceux au peanuts)

Les biscottes aux crevettes frites sont absolument délicieuses, le poulet général tao aussi (à partager). L'immense plat de soupe wonton a su nous remplir à souhait et les dumplings à la vapeur au porc avec sauce vinaigrée nous ont carrément achevés. Have some you won't regret it !"}
{"text":"Really disappointing food and dreadful atmosphere. Ordered the soup with Peking duck and noodles. The broth was bland and the duck meat over-powering. Enjoyed the birds nest with seafood, minus the undercooked onion pieces. The chicken with cashews was not very appetizing. The chicken pieces were very tiny and greatly outnumbered by the other ingredients."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best cantonese restaurant in montreal...

highlights
peking hot soup - the most tasty hot & sour soup i have ever tasted
roast BBQ duck - the best meat on the menu
beef in a hot pot
chinese brocoli & oyster sauce
cantonese chow mein - noodles are so crispy!

Update - it's still the best!"}
{"text":"Un ami chinois m'a fait connaître ce resto cantonais il y a quarante ans et j'y retourne régulièrement depuis ce temps. Même \"décor\" un peu glauque, même menu, rien n'a changé, mis à part les serveurs qui se sont francisés un peu avec les années. La bouffe est égale à elle-même. Donc, pas de grandes surprises d'une fois à l'autre. La soupe won-ton, une spécialité de la maison, est toujours aussi exquise. Les prix sont demeurés plus qu'abordables et les quantités sont toujours aussi généreuses. Plusieurs Montréalais d'origine péruvienne l'ont adopté, car il semble que la cuisine chinoise est très populaire chez eux. Donc, ne vous y étonnez pas d'entendre parler espagnol, et chinois bien entendu."}
{"text":"Large portions,  great prices for area,  delicious food.  Ordered food at 6:10pm, food was ready at 6:18pm. Ordered fried dumplings (perfect), general taos chicken (delicious,  pinkish so was hesitant but was fully cooked), shrimp fried rice (small size,  still a huge portion, delicious, and noodles with chicken and veggies (huge serving,  delicious). Lose a star for the pinkish chicken before i checked and it temp'd correctly."}
{"text":"They have duck soup! Just that is already good... there is not that much chinese places in town that serves duck soup... and it was quite good.

The rest was average. Next time we will try to Peking Duck which might be good is the soup is an indication.

Place is casual and service was fast."}
{"text":"Chinese tourists go on a trip, where do they eat dinner?  Chinatown!  Cliche, I know.

That aside, the food here is solid.  I highly recommend the \"pots\" which are a variation of the sizzling clay pot (variation being a super hot metal pot) where the food is cooking when it comes out.  We were recommended the salted fish and tofu (being of Cantonese heritage and all) and it did not disappoint.  We also ordered the eggplant pot which was REALLY GOOD.  

The Peking duck was much better than I expected (disclaimer: I am not really a Peking duck fan) but everyone at the table was pleased with it overall.  

The lobster was also good (we ordered it stir fry, Canto style) but in retrospect I think a steamed lobster would have been healthier.  It was really tasty, but they deep fried it prior to stir frying, thus retaining texture and moisture and super tasty, but adding in some cooking oil I would have been fine without.  

I do not recommend the soup though.  I don't remember which soup we ordered, but it was definitely over salted.

Food came out really quick, meal for 5 took no more than 1.5 hours to order and eat.  Service was friendly. No complaints there."}
{"text":"Fung shing was excellent! Large portions and very good! Service good and staff friendly."}
{"text":"This place feels like home made Chinese food. 

The restaurant feels like it's been there forever (which it probably has) and the servers speak canto too. Food is good portions and fast. 

Ordered the seafood and tofu soup (it tasted right, but it didn't have a lot of seafood), rice noodles with beef (okay, but I expected it to be hotter and greasier - true to Chinese food form), the lemon chicken (actually quite chicken heavy), and the fried tofu and veggies (this was too much veggie and my enough fried tofu)."}
{"text":"Pros: food is very fresh, clean establishment, very fast, reasonably priced, generous portions, accepts credit cards, beef congee was great. 

Cons: none"}
{"text":"A quaint restaurant in the heart of Montreal's Chinatown. Big portions. Excellent food and service. Very reasonable price. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The last time that I had set foot here was when I was about 8-10 years old. It's been awhile lol! My family was coming to visit me from Florida and requested some wontons from here. I must say that they regretted it. Sad. The wontons didn't taste like anything. It felt like I was biting in a ball of fat. It was so bland and the texture was off putting. The Cantonese chow mein lacked seasoning and the noodles were undercooked. I wish I could say something good about this place but besides the fact that the lady at the cash register was very nice to me."}
