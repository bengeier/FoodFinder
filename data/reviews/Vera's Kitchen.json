{"text":"We've been passing by this place a lot and I've always thought we should give it a go someday. Apparently today was that day.
After being recommended by a friend last night and almost passing by it again, we found ourselves outside its door browsing through the pictures and prices of the foods outside the window. 
The old lady invited us inside with a friendly smile to show us some real food instead of starting at the window.
Hubby and I shared a single cabbage roll, a bowl of borscht and as sides some potato salad, basmati rice and buckwheat. We were both full eventually and had no room for the Russian cake they offered us. 
It's not a fancy restaurant but the food, the interior and how the old couple treated us was just like my grandma does. Even the food tasted just like my grandma! 
Vera and her husband are a cute old couple who are doing a great job! We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful adventure. 
The owners were so kind and welcoming, real Russian hospitality. I went there with a small group of friends, we each tried something different and shared...it was all delicious and we ate it all with absolute joy.
The fish was great, so we're the meatballs and the cabbage roll was super.
For a beverage we had Kvass. It was divine. My friends had never had it and were instantly hooked.
I am so happy to have found this place. Will for sure go back and bring other folks to try this home made style food."}
{"text":"If you're thinking this spartan-looking diner might be a hidden gem I urge you to think again.  The facade says 100% quality foods, cooked fresh - both these statements are a lie.

I entered for lunch and was shocked to see the cook show me all the meal options already cooked just sitting on the counter.  Nothing is cooked fresh, unless you consider it freshly reheated to order.  I opted for some rice and lamb only to see both piled on a plate and then placed in the microwave for several minutes.

After the wait I was handed over a lump of rice and some lamb.  I had to locate the cutlery myself and brought my food to the table.  What little chance of redemption existed up until this point died when I took a bite of the food.  The rice was overcooked to the point of mush: if you had told me it was some sort of potato puree I would have believed you.  The lamb was passable, but sinewy and bland.  It was obvious that these were the cheapest cuts possible.

To add insult to injury the place is expensive.  A meager meal of okay lamb, rice puree, and a bottle of water came out at close to $17.00.  My advice, stay away from Vera's Place unless you're part of the filming crew for Gordon's Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"A sweet family run kitchen by a European couple. Most dishes taste like home style cooking , pricing is decent, some of the options however get to oily . The good is quite filling and of good quality. This place has somehow and miraculously survived the harsh business environment of Eglinton East area, and that's mainly due to repeat customers and home style food options :-) There Borsch , chicken pesto , stew and rice are tasty options."}
{"text":"For a quick lunch spot, this place is as good as it gets for me. I cook 90% of my meals at home and I always use fresh, mostly organic ingredients. Vera's is as close as I can get to my own food and I LOVE that! Everything I have had there...delicious. The fish is tasty, the chicken is always flavorful, and the salad bar has the best roasted eggplant. Being able to put together your own plate of salad (or veggies, whatever you pick) is the best. Healthy and home cooked. They DO microwave the food to heat it up for you, but I feel that is a small price to pay for the quality of food that is prepared. The owners are sweet and appreciative. I will always support a local business like Vera's over a chain fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I went today for the first time for lunch and ordered a breaded chicken breast sandwich. Yes, the chicken breast pieces were ready sitting on the counter , based on another review, but they were very fresh and delicious. They tasted the same way my wife cooks them at home , and she is a wonderful cook. It had the same texture too. The sandwich was quite big and the vegetables they added were super fresh. I enjoyed my lunch and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about Vera's and finally popped in today at lunch for a sandwich to go.  The husband owner immediately greeted me and shared all the specials--stirring the pots of meatballs and such to entice me:)  I settled on a chicken wrap...and OMG...let me tell you....I have NEVER, EVER had a better chicken wrap in my life.  Fresh lettuce, tomatoes, freshly diced seasoned chicken breast, Parmesan cheese and some kind of heavenly sauce wrapped in a wheat pita. My expectations were blown away. Not sure how they made something so simple taste so incredible, but I will be back...soon."}
{"text":"Found this place along Eglinton while Jannies L. and I were looking for a place because I was HUNGGGGG-reeeeee! It's a small, diner-type place on the inside. 

As soon as we came in, we were greeted by a couple (husband and wife, I'm assuming) who were super friendly and welcoming! We were taking a look at the menu to see what was available, and all the while they were making suggestions here and there. It got kind of distracting, but I appreciate the gesture. 

I settled on cabbage rolls with a side of rice/pasta and she went for perogies. A bottle of Grolsch rounded out our order. My dish was quite good, definitely hit the spot. The perogies were alright, they definitely weren't made in house, which was a bit of a let down. It honestly felt like I came over for dinner at someone's house, much less like I was dining out somewhere. Nice!

Prices were on the average to high end of things, and I wasn't looking to spend too much when I first walked in. But the combination of my empty tummy and the charm on the part of the folks serving us did me in 100%. Overall quite good, though I don't know if it's a place I would frequent."}
{"text":"The place has good ambience feel like eating at home. The time when we were visiting there was no much variety of Russian authentic food just Russian soup and cabbage rolls with meat. Cabbage rolls and soup were amazing with good quality meat, but everything else is so-so.. We have tried also grilled vegetables and chicken parmesan.
I was disappointed Becuase I wish there were more local dishes like beefstroganoff or Russian salads.
I don't think I'm coming back soon since everything that they have I can make myself at home, it's not really as special as I wished and pricy in my opinion"}
{"text":"Homey place...had chicken cachetory and like the tangy taste. Very friendly old couple, feels like eating at home."}
{"text":"So sad to say that Vera's Kitchen's last day at this location was yesterday.  They know me as \"Mr. King\", and am a big fan favourite of their bass fish plate and salad.  Vera and Edward will be missed, however, I heard that they may be doing catering and delivery.  So that is great news!
See you both soon, and may God bless you."}
{"text":"The owners are the absolute sweetest people ever. It is like going to see your grandparents. The food is simple but quite tasty and the prices are reasonable. It is a relaxing, casual place with a good vibe and all types of homemade comfort food. It is also vegetarian friendly which was a pleasant surprise. I am glad I paid a visit and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Cozy little place in a busy street run by a sweet elderly Russian couple. Upon entering I didn't have the chance to browse through the menu posted on the wall because the hosts were so eager to introduce every item on the counter. You'll get the sense that if they say it's good, you won't be disappointed. Loved the organic meatballs! Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"I like coming here and supporting private businesses which have been in the community for 10+ years. Vera's is no exception with a warm friendly couple running the little eatery offering everything from salads to mains like cutlets, cabbage rolls, stews and more. Everything is fresh and made that day. It reminds me of eating at nona's kitchen when you want some comforting food for whatever reason. Yes the price point may be on the high side but you need to consider the location and what rent is like here; this isn't Jane/Finch. You will definitely leave feeling full and satisfied.  Expect them to try to up sell you everything. They haven't been in business for this long by being passive so don't be offended."}
{"text":"Came around 7pm, not so many guests but only one guy dining at the front facing the TV. 

Pretty welcoming atmosphere and the male owner was very friendly too. I just loved the food - comfort food, nothing fancy but absolutely delicious. I only tried the buckwheat, it's a must and I believe it's called Grechka or something in Russian, also the potatoes and roasted chicken, reminds me of my grandparents. Also I noticed that they use microwave to warm up food and honestly I have no issues with that, everything was fresh, food were pre-prepared so it is definitely fine.

In the end I finished the meal, paid and the female owner came out, passed a slice of fresh watermelon to me. 

I would definitely bring some more friends, come and visit again."}
{"text":"Nice homely place run by an elderly family. Big fan of their meatballs - delicious."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place with delicious Russian food. We tried Golubsti (stuffed cabbage), stuffed peppers, Pierogi (with potatoes and sour cream), Grechka (buckwheat), salad, and Medovik (cake) - in one lunch. Every single item tastes like home made, and Medovik is fresh, and has nuts in it which adds to the great texture. They also have Ochakovski Kvas, to go with lunch food.

The owners are super nice, accommodating, and kind. They tuned down air conditioning when we decided  to sit inside."}
{"text":"I'm scared to eat there. I'm not sure what it looks like in the back of the kitchen. In the front counter, there were dirty bowls everywhere. The microwave door was open and it looks disgusting inside. The guy was really eager and I almost got scammed into buying food until he told me he was going to microwave the rice or I could microwave it at home. ...."}
{"text":"The place has a nice home atmosphere. Very pleasant hosts. I had borshch and cabbage roll. I'm Ukrainian so these two dishes are home food for me and I can make good judgments on their quality. Borshch was very good, tasty. Cabbage rolls were so so, too greasy with overcooked cabbage."}
{"text":"I am so surprised by the great reviews here. This place was so disappointing. I'm Russian and all the food I've ever had in my family is so much better. They serve spaghetti and meatballs - that is not Russian food. There are so many delicious dishes that they are choosing not to serve. Sure the owners are friendly - the gentleman was so friendly, it was borderline unprofessional. We paid $30 for one plate with rice, meatballs and some grilled pepper. As well as one blinz. Everything was bland, and the portions were tiny. Needless to say, I won't be introducing my friends to Russian food here."}
{"text":"what a nice lady that works there.  so polite and sweet.  and the stuffed pepper was awesome the taste totally was flavourful and hit the spot.  nice to know they have organic selections.  could have had some gluten free bread but thats alright.  super yumms."}
{"text":"I went there cuz I really missed Russian food and wasn't disappointed. On the contrary, decent prices, nice and calm atmosphere, friendly owners eager to help you made my lunch very pleasant. The food is really tasty. for some people who haven't ever tried Russian kind of style food maybe it could seem a bit salty, but that's the way how we like it :) 
Wish the owners to have more grateful and regular customers!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. It is right across the street from my workplace. The first time I went there, I got their chicken breast wrap which I thought was small and overpriced, however, extremely delicious!

The only reason I am giving this place a 3/5 is because of the price. Most prices are blocked on the food menu that they have hung up outside and inside the restaurant which makes me think they need a major make-over. 

What threw me off is that the price for the special was supposed to be 10.95 according to the big poster near the door but when I asked the lady, she said the price is FROM 10.95 and charged me 13.50 with tax for my meal. I got their meatballs, spaghetti, basmati rice and a chilli pepper. It was no where on the menu but the lady said that was the special for the day. 

The portion was big but definitely not worth that price. To be nice, the lady gave me an extra bottle of water. The fact that the restaurant was empty made me think that maybe they are going out of business and are desperate for money. 

Overall though, I would say the food is quite homely and delicious and the couple that runs the restaurant is hospitable but the price aspect made the experience a little negative for me. I am not sure if I would go back there again if they continue to be fishy with the price."}
{"text":"I give this place a 5star for an amazing service, yummy food, cozy interior... and the Russian owner who speaks my language. This place definitely a place to try. Food are sooo good, home made and with love. I am definitely a fan and a new frequent customer."}
{"text":"Just got take out from this restaurant. I'm Russian Ukrainian so I really enjoyed eating food that's from my culture. The service is great and the prices are fair considering the neighbourhood. Strongly recommend this place! Thank you for the lovely dinner."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Vera's Kitchen, but there are a couple of things to keep in mind.  It's more of a takeout place with tables (and a huge TV on the 24 hour news channel), than a proper sit down restaurant.  But that's fine.  As others have mentioned, the couple running the place are super friendly and the food is good.  There are only four or five choices of the most popular dishes (cabbage rolls, borsht, chicken legs, etc.), but they're well prepared.  The prices are on the high end, but in the end I'd still give four out of five stars because the couple were so friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Absolute great find in Toronto!  Healthy, flavorful and home-made food on Eglinton! Generous portions at terrific price.  Will eat here again when back in  Toronto!"}
{"text":"This is a funny little place, run by an older immigrant couple (Russian, according to a previous reviewer).  The old guy is quite the character - as soon as you walk in and start looking at the menu, he starts telling you what you should have - \"Very good schnitzel today!\", etc.  

The food is not amazing but it is homey, and the prices are reasonable.  They have a variety of sandwiches and a selection of hot meals, which I'm guessing is dependent on what they decided to cook up that day.  Cute."}
{"text":"Experiencing homesick brought me to Vera's place. ..So I just finished my beef cabbage roll and it is soooo amazing, homemade with a lot of well seasoned beef. Delicious ! Can't wait to introduce Russian kitchen to my international friends! 
The owners are very nice as well. Make you feel comfortable and relaxed"}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars      
Strolling along Eglinton when I stopped to check out a large poster of their menu on the outside. A friendly elderly lady came out to greet me and invited me inside to check out their whole menu. The restaurant seems to be run by an elderly couple. They were really trying to sell me on...basically everything, but I only wanted a Greek salad. It was $7.99 so about $9 with tax. Portion size was ok. Box was big but it wasn't very filled. Salad was pretty fresh. A little too much dressing but good overall. 

Ambiance: 2.5 stars
Very simple interior. A little rundown. I wouldn't really want to sit down and eat there. More of a grab and go sort of place. 

Service: 3 stars
I don't really like to be sold on anything. I prefer to just look and I'll ask if I want clarification on a dish but they were very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This place was good and odd all at the same time. Let me first say our food ended up being really good. I don't want that to get buried in my review. 

So we stumbled in from seeing good reviews and we were greeted with open arms by who I assume to be Vera! She was happy to see us coming in. The golabki was what caught my eye. My grandmother always made these in her Polish kitchen and I hadn't had one in a LONG time so why not have one from here? The ordering process was disorganized and lengthy. They would start one order and then another and get off track and couldn't keep track of who's was whose. They seemingly had a hot food buffet in chafing dishes but everything was heated in a microwave which made taking getting our food forever since they could only heat one plate at a time...so yeah...the items on menu are definitely not what looks like it's available. The husband and wife kind of just suggest what to put on your plate and you nod yes or no but there wasn't a rhyme or reason to meals. Somehow my friend got a cabbage roll with a side of rice and penne pasta...and I got a roll with a huge Caesar salad...um what? Like no one offered me the grain sides! I was totally happy with my salad but there wasn't any cohesion. It took awhile to get our plates sorted out.

The food was good though. I found the sauce on the dish be a little sweet which was a nice touch. Just something different. Not like sugary or dessert sweet, but just a touch of sweet tomatoes. It was good. 

The dishes were a bit expensive though for glorified microwave plates. $12.99 CAD but should be more like $8.99, $9.99 tops for heated up in front of you in a microwave fare. So yeah. 

We heard this place was closing...sad, but not totally unexpected. Just glad I got a golabki in time!"}
{"text":"Vera's Place is a quaint little restaurant on Yonge and Eglinton. The place is run by an elderly Russian couple. The lady is very friendly, but the gentleman is somewhat hard to understand (very thick Russian accent) so keep in mind that ordering your food can be quite an ordeal.

As for the food, I had the chicken breast sandwich on a sesame seed bagel. My bagel was a little bit burnt, but the veggies were very fresh and the chicken was tasty. They even added a special spicy Russian sauce which was very delicious.

If you are looking for a quick, cheap and somewhat healthy lunch, then Vera's Place is the right \"place\" for you."}
{"text":"It's amazing. It's just amazing. They are extremely nice to all customers and they are really friendly. Not restaurant friendly but friend's parents friendly.
Yes it was around 17 + dollars per dish and it was a bit salty. But it was a very unique experience and I'm glade I tried it. :)"}
