{"text":"Was there for lunch on weekdays. Decor is okay. Food is spot on. They were busy but service was good. Food is awesome. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service - I'm so glad this restaurant was added to the Kent dining choices.  Go for lunch and try a lunch box - there are so many different combinations you'll never get bored.  The Pik King curry and the Thai Style Basil are simply great.  The country style Pad Thai is a bit different from the usual.  Brown rice is a standard option (not an upgrade).  They'll honor requests for spice adjustments, so you can get to Thai hot level or very mild."}
{"text":"Well deserved 4 star rating, had the papaya salad which was really good made me feel like I was in BKK; certainly would eat here again."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out from here a handful of times. Staff is very friendly! My orders have always been ready within 10-15 minutes. The prices are fair and you get good sized portions. The orange chicken is delicious! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Moving to Ohio I wasn't so sure where I could get good thai food from, but this place was around the corner so I gave it a try. I only ordered to go so I can't comment on the actual dining experience. The food wasn't bad though, albeit a little bland and the portions are small. 

I love red curry but you don't get much of it. Its more like a light sauce over your veggies whereas everywhere I ate in LA they gave you a massive carton of curry that was more like a soup. I guess I got used to my food being served that way and being able to pour it over my rice and have leftovers. It also wasn't spicy at all which was a little disappointing, but it was still good. I also got the fried tofu triangles which aren't as good as others I have had, the sauce is too sweet and doesn't taste like its supposed to, and the tofu is too dry and a little bland. I would eat here again because I like their seaweed salad, but it hasn't really filled my thai food void. They  don't seem to deliver very far either but that seems to be the experience with a lot of places in Kent. I live less than a two minute drive away and they wouldn't deliver, but maybe people here don't drive as much."}
{"text":"I really liked the drunken noodles and the spring rolls I believe they are called. Service was really good and food was as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried Wild Papaya carry out last night.  Not happy. was charged the dinner price for two dishes -- $26+ --listed on the online menu at about $8 each.  I'm not a \"bigger iis better\" restaurant reviewer, bit portions were laughably small.  Food was ok. Bland.  How can Thai food -- really good Thai food -- be bland?  Might be worth a sit-down, dine-in try.  But I doubt it."}
{"text":"Great meal and great service! The menu has so many options. I got the drunken noodles which were great. Nice quiet atmosphere"}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing! I don't know much about authentic thai food. Nevertheless, the service was excellent as all of the employees were extremely kind and helpful. The pad thai was absolutely delicious! The bubble tea tastes like a heavenly milkshake! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Well, the food tasted ok, but the value isn't very good for the price. The fact that they raise the price for dinner menu from the lunch menu and don't increase the portion is quite a ripoff. I guess if you go early and can pay the lunch price it would be better. However, I got the hot and sour shrimp soup, it had only 2 shrimp in it, and they left the tails on the shrimp! I got green curry shrimp, for 12.95 and it had about 5 shrimp in it WITH THE TAILS LEFT ON! How savage is that, to not take the tails off?! So I have to get my fingers dirty pulling tails off shrimp and being grossed out by them while eating.Won't order the shrimp items again if I go back ever. And I will only go for lunch prices."}
{"text":"Just seems like pretty overpriced average Thai food to me."}
{"text":"IF YOU'RE ORDERING OUT, CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU WALK OUT!  Not once, but TWICE I have ordered meals with tofu only to get home to discover that they contained chicken or shrimp!  The first time it happened, they apologized and sent a driver with the correct food.  The second time (only a month later) they told me they didn't have a delivery person any longer and I had to return to the store to pick up the correct order.  Of course I brought the food back, received no apology, no discount, no free spring rolls or anything.  The unapologetic woman working the register was unphased that I had not only waited way longer than was promised for my food nor did she seem to care that the order was wrong - so much for customer service and so much for me ever returning to this place.  The food is only so-so, anyway."}
{"text":"Good quality lunch. Chicken satay appetizer with peanut sauce was good. The peanut sauce was delightful. Had the Hot Beef lunch box with pot-stickers. Pot- stickers (chicken) were good. The veggie mix was not all crunchy which was great because they were not over done soggy veggies but not undercooked crunchy. The only downside is that there were a handful of beef pieces in the mix. I wrote that off because it was indeed a lunch portion. Everything very edible considering Asian cuisine of most types are outside of my comfort zone. Will definitely go back to try some of the curry menu."}
{"text":"I gave this place two tries. The first, they sat us, didn't give us water and ignored us for about 10 minutes. They didn't even look at us, so we left. The next time I was there, still no water even though the hostess stand was a foot away. I ended up pouring my own water. When the food came, the veggies were cold but the chicken was hot, evidence of some sort of ill-conceived assembly line. The people who brought our food to us were dressed in track pants. Never again. Terrible service. Mediocre food."}
{"text":"Reached the restaurant famished and left happy!there was difficulty in locating the place but the food was really good.the panang curry and sweet sticky are \"to die for\"! Pineapple fried rice was also very good.The place may look lonely but found there are a lot of take outs too!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Kent. My favorites: spring rolls & Crazy Noodle-Drunken Noodle.The Pad Thai and Crispy Pad Thai were hits with this table. My friend's Fried Ice Cream dessert was a work of art. Good service by a friendly staff. I will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Seafood Madness for lunch, which was decent for a $9 red curry dish. Portion size wasn't anything to get excited about, but the seafood (a muscle, squid, and a couple shrimp) and vegetables (zucchini and yellow squash) were cooked well.

I wouldn't definitely not recommend the hot and sour shrimp soup, as it is far from the hot and sour soup that you'd normally expect. It is a very sour watery broth with an almost disturbing smell, filled with undercooked mushrooms and just two shrimp. Even at under $4, I would recommend avoiding it.

On the bright side, our server was friendly and the decor wasn't as tacky as other budget Asian restaurants I've visited. If you're looking for reasonably priced Asian cuisine around Kent, this is an option, but you'll probably find better elsewhere."}
{"text":"It has been my absolute favorite place to eat for years. We moved to Cleveland two years ago and I haven't been back since then. But since I've been pregnant, all I want is their veggie potstickers and tofu red curry. My angel husband drove me an hour to get there, and it is STILL the best red curry I will ever have. They are consistent and friendly and I would drive from almost anywhere to eat here."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Fast Service!!
Good Atmosphere and music!!
I've been here over a 24 times, might go back today. Muahahah
The only good restaurant in the area open on Sunday!!!
Don't listen to the bad reviews!
Any good restaurant I've been to leaves the tails on the shrimp! Duh!
It's decently price too. 
They have cheap dishes and well as higher priced ones. All depends on what you order.
Don't let a few stupid people sway your decision!!! Hope to see there!!! :^D"}
{"text":"Coconut chicken soup and basil fried rice are great but the orange chicken is phenomenal"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. We ordered the Panang curry and Pad Thai noodles. Both were delicious. The ambience is great and service is excellent. I would love to go back again and explore the menu!"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch today the Wild Papaya. The food was very fresh not swimming in grease.. The jasmine rice was moist and flavorful. The service was excellent. The price wasn't anymore that you would pay for a sandwich at Panera. I hope many people check it out, so they stay in business:)"}
{"text":"This was our first time... I had pad Thai and my husband basil fried rice. Both were delicious. The servers were very attentive and our water's were continually topped off. We will come back!"}
{"text":"I find myself perpetually unsatisfied with Thai food, but keep eating it anyway, because, on a busy work night, even the most inconsistent Asian food is a cut above your average burger, pizza or corporate restaurant fare.    The good news about Wild Papaya is that, if you're a noodly person like I am, you'll walk away happy; Pad Thai and Pad-See-Ew are done well here (don't be fooled by the Pad Thai's bland color).  Heaping portions with the requisite array of toppings and aromatics: crushed peanuts, lime wedges, shredded cabbage on your Pad Thai, and plenty of thai basil and sweet soy soaked up by the thick, chewy, fresh rice noodles in your Pad-See-Ew.  Appetizers are interesting (green gyoza wrappers for veggie dumplings) and soups promise tangy, tasty broths.

More than adequate for your neighborhood, Tuesday night hassle-free dinner."}
{"text":"Very intersting food which I can only describe as a creative twist to Thai standars. My Som-Tom was a delightful mix of familiar Thai flavours, sour, sweet, salty, and spicy on top of very cruchy (fresh) green papaya. As a bonus it was topped with satay chicken. Their unique take on Lemongrass chicken was amazing. A large portion of grilled thin slices of chicken breast that had a distintice hint of lemongras, served over stir fried vegetables. The only negative is that the food could have been hotter (spice), and the staff didn't give you that option.

Overall, a very nice, clean restaurant, with very friendly and efficient staff."}
{"text":"Yummy and delicious Thai food here! I recommend it. I am a vegetarian and love their veg friendly food. My boyfriend however ordered the orange Chicken and it was a little green? But otherwise I liked it..."}
{"text":"This place is good. I really want to try the thai restaurant called, Cilantro, in Akron.  So far in the Kent, Ohio area, the thai food has not been mind blowingly great, & taste kind of white washed. Beautiful presentation and very kind staff!"}
{"text":"We were really craving Thai, and went to go to Tai Wah in Streetsboro, but they were closed. We had passed by this place before so we decided to try it out. 

We always start with Tom Yum soup, and it was okay. The broth was more sour than we usually like. My boyfriend got the Country Style Pad Thai and that was pretty good, however it is listed as spicy which is why he went with it, and there was no heat to it whatsoever. I got the Duck Choo Chee lunch special. The duck was great, and the meal is a great value for your money. The pot stickers were very bland.

Basically, it was all just average. The service was quick and friendly. We will definitely stick with Tai Wah in the future!"}
{"text":"If any of you guys are familiar with the Brown Sugar Thai Cuisine in Lakewood or Rocky River, Wild Papaya Thai seems like a brother or sister restaurant to that as it has a very similar menu and selection. To start this is one of the few places where you can get Thai food in the Kent/Ravenna area, I really don't know if there is anywhere else. It is a very relaxed pleasant looking place. Me and my girlfriend went here for lunch one day. The servers were very kind to us and always made us we had filled glasses of ice water. We ordered summer rolls as an appetizer and I got the Yellow Curry and she got the Pad Thai. Summer rolls were really fresh and delicious with that peanut sauce served with it. The yellow curry had a nice amount of thickness to it and it was pretty darn tasty. The Pad Thai was quite good as well. I recommend anyone to eat here during the lunch specials and get a lunch box item of your choice. It's quite a good deal."}
{"text":"Legit one of my favorite restaurants ever. They've always been incredibly kind and attentive. The food IS AMAZING!  Best papaya salad ever. The rice dishes are excellent. Noodle dishes are excellent. Curry dishes are out of this world. We've been multiple times with groups and with just our family and it's always been consistent and wonderful. Anyone who wants Thai food should go here."}
{"text":"I had some fantastic pad this here the other night. We were passing through and a friend recommended this place. Everyone loved their dishes. 

And such friendly service!"}
{"text":"I'd describe this place as having so-so thai food. The food wasn't bad, but nothing amazing either. I had the tofu string beans and my brother had the basil fried rice, minus the chicken. The tofu string beans were good, though the curry sauce became quite salty as I kept eating. The vegetarian basil fried rice was pretty good! Savory and filling for sure. I do have to say that we expected to get more steamed vegetarian pot stickers for the $5.50 price tag. However, the entree portions were fair for the price and service was nice which made the overall restaurant experience pretty good."}
{"text":"Yum! My mom's favorite place to eat in Kent and occasionally I'm able to make it here with her.

The crab rangoon is a little different than usual but I liked it! It almost seemed like cheddar inside. Can't say for sure but I'm a sucker for crab rang so I liked it. 

I had the pineapple fried rice and it was sooo perfect. The city powder was a great addition. 

Wish I could make it up here more often, I'd like to make it through more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Clean. Not the best Thai, not the worst. I love Thai food. My dish was the Curry Duck.  Too many onions and carrots and no other veggies. It was missing the \"multi-spice\" flavor I love in Thai food. Very friendly service. I'd eat here again if I was in town but, won't drive an hour again."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.

They have a great selection of Thai and curry dishes. The decor is quaint and Eastern themed. The restaurant is always clean and the staff friendly.

My go to dish is the chicken basil kapow. Absolutely delicious! What I like best is they will make this HOT and spicy. You can order the heat level from 1-5. I order 5 and it is very hot but completely edible and fantastic.

I highly recommend this place for those looking for great Thai food in a comfortable environment at a decent price. They also do carry out."}
{"text":"Amazing! My friends and I go here all the time. I usually get the orange chicken because the batter they use is incredible. The country pad Thai is also really good! The service is also great."}
{"text":"Excellent local Thai restaurant (the best in the area) with some truly authentic dishes. Very tasty, great atmosphere and a friendly staff. One very minor gripe - the pop seems to come from cans and is usually stale."}
{"text":"It was just \"meh\".  I asked for \"Thai hot\" and got something watered down for american palettes.  Luckily they had some peppers I could add to heat things up a bit.  Price wasn't bad.  I've had better and I've definitely had worse Thai.  I wouldn't drive out of the way to go back, but if I was in the neighborhood I might give them another try."}
{"text":"Good food with great service. The atmosphere is nice and the dishes are all at decent prices."}
{"text":"TALK ABOUT \"GREAT THAI\" - this place is worth our 30 mile drive! Wow, we went three times last month and have had 6 different meals between the two of us and TOP NOTCH!!! Hot, like food should be and served right away as well. Love this place. Very bright and cheerful too!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wild Papaya is a great Thai place! I've dined in and had take-out and have been pleased every time I've tried a new dish. The dining room is peaceful and the wait staff are attentive and patient.
I've never actually been to Thailand so can't say much for the authenticity but everything I've had has been tasty!"}
{"text":"Great service, superb meal and a welcome new Kent establishment! 

Appetizer-wise I sampled both vegetarian and chicken pot stickers which were both amazing, and the papaya roll which was awesome.

For my lunch I chose the Crazy Noodle and it was fabulous, flavorful but not really \"hot\" just a hint o' kick here and there and a generous portion that left me with a good amount for dinner.

The Crazy Noodle was so good that I don't know I could be convinced to get anything different in the future if it wasn't for the fact that everyone in my party raved about their meals which were all different selections.

Highly recommended, I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"I got a carry out of the Pad Thai Country Style dish and it was amazing; very flavorful!  The quantity was much larger than I expected.  The inside of the restaurant was very clean and the staff was extremely friendly! Definitely will be heading back soon!"}
{"text":"Really good Thai food for Kent. I'd strongly recommended the Pad Thai or the green curry, both are amazing! The waitstaff is extremely friendly"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. Servers are attentive and food is reasonably priced. I've never tried their carry out option but I plan to in the near future. Comfort food meets a fairly healthy alternative with vegetables."}
{"text":"Good, cheap Thai in Kent! Quick service if you're looking for a lunch break."}
{"text":"I love to stop in here just to get an Iced Green Bubble Tea. Such a great alternative to a Starbucks Frappuccino. 

The Thai food is good too!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! Wait staff was efficient and food was awesome! Fresh flavors took me back to Thailand.! Nice quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wonderfully delicious food! The woman who was our server was very nice. There's no delivery, but there IS very fast takeout-ready time. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing. No tvs or pop radio yelling in your ear. Ahhh and did I mention the food is tasty?!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT curry dishes as well as drunken noodles!! Haven't had authentic \"crazy\" rice noodles other than in Boston. The waitresses are the sweetest most adorable people. The water is from the tap so I'd order a pop."}
{"text":"By far my favorite food! My dad and I stop for food here so often the employees know what we want already! The seafood coconut soup is to die for! (I prefer it with chicken instead of seafood) this is my favorite thai restaurant, and my favorite food in general!! The workers are always super nice and service is quick and fresh. If you enjoy thai, you will LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"If you like Thai food, you know how you like it. So here's a tip- The menu only shows 2 peppers for their spicy dishes, however, you may order the dish as spicy as you want! Just tell the waitress you want  3 peppers, 5 peppers, or Thai Hot! This restaurant has consistently had the freshest ingredients of anyplace I've eaten in the area, the service is great, the atmosphere warm & intimate, and the price is right. If you like Thai food, and you know what you like, you can't go wrong. If you don't ,try the Wild Boar (pork) in Basil, or the Kapow. Also some very nice seafood dishes here. Wine list only, no beer."}
{"text":"Usually this place is a great experience for me but unfortunately not tonight. I wanted to try something a little different than my usual pad thai (which is very good), so I ordered the emerald curry. The waitress told me something about it, but I didn't really understand what she was saying (language barrier). She didn't really explain, so I thought it wasn't a big deal. Food comes, and the smell of the curry made me feel sick. Plus, the flavor wasn't good. When I told the waitress nicely I wanted something else, she reacted very rudely. She told me twice, clearly exasperated, that she had tried to tell me the curry didn't have some ingredient in it that I still haven't figured out. She made me feel really stupid, and that's not her job. Usually the wait staff there are friendly, so I'm disappointed by how they treated me this time around. I was trying something new, and it didn't work out. Big deal. Anyway, probably will be looking for another thai place soon, even though the food/service here hasn't let me down until tonight. Also, too expensive."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Thai place. The restaurant is nice and the servers were friendly. The food was good but not extraordinary. The flavors were there but they were flat, unlike what you get at a good Thai restaurant. Also, my boyfriend loves spicy food so he ordered the hottest on the scale given. Either they did not hear him or thought he must have been joking because his meal was just as mild as mine. Not too much of a problem though since you can ask for the spice rack and spice it up to your heart's desire!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Thai food, and I have to say I'm very pleased! I've lived across the street from Wild Papaya for years, but never actually visited until just recently. I've for sure been missing out!

I ordered the rainbow rice bowl that had a different assortment of veggies, brown rice, tofu and some kind of soy sauce. It was delicious, and probably some of the best Asian cuisine I've ever had! I also ordered the mango bubble tea. It wasn't the best bubble tea I've had, it was almost more like a smoothie, but it was still pretty tasty. 

The reason I'm giving the restaurant four stars instead of five is because my waitress was a little too attentive. She came by my table at least every 10 minutes and interrupted my conversation multiple times. The food is also a little pricy. My entire meal was $16, which is more than I usually spend at a restaurant in Kent. Overall though I'm super happy with my meal at Wild Papaya!"}
{"text":"Decent Thai food for Portage county! 

They have a great lunch deal (small app, salad, and regular sized entree for less than $10), and we frequently get takeout. I like their veggie or duck curries (all of the sauces are tasty)."}
{"text":"The food is not really stellar here and I believe there are way better Thai places depending on where you want to drive. The portions are also very small for the money compared to other Thai places. However, the service is fantastic and the people that work there are very pleasant and attentive. I wish the food was better and I'd go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I ordered edamame for an appetizer and Siam Fried rice for my entree. I loved the taste of the fried rice and it was a nice, large portion. However, I thought that the edamame was overpriced for the small portion. In regards to the restaurant, it was quiet, very clean, and a nice environment. Would recommend if you like Thai or Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Had duck choo chi and country pad thai on a Friday afternoon. The food came out literally in five minutes. The duck meat was really well cooked. Country pad thai is similar to a regular rendition, but it was a refreshing change."}
{"text":"Easy on the wallet & yummy in your tummy- can't go wrong with their mouth watering Crazy Noodle(drunken noodle) dish nor their Satay. The prices are very fair & their portions are equally as pleasing. The staff is always friendly, the restaurant is clean & they are one of the few places open late on Sundays.

They also offer a unique yet refreshing Bubble Tea(milk tea), the decor is is somewhat a cross between modern meets traditional Thai; just love their cute little ball-like lights & the atmosphere is a nice change from the typical Kent bars & eateries. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for somewhere nice (but not too extravagant) for a date, to take a client out to lunch or a pleasant birthday dinner,etc..."}
{"text":"Reasonable place. Siam rolls for a starter and mango sticky rice at the end were the highlights. Sauce with the rolls had a twist of heat, just right. Dessert was a large, well-trimmed piece of fruit and the perfect amount of rice. 

The pad Thai main was ... Adequate. Just two small shrimp. Could have used  some lime wedges. 

Service was fine. I'll give it a second chance. Probably with something less obvious than pad Thai."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice portions. Fast take out service. They're not open on Monday, but the pad Thai is so good I'm willing to wait."}
{"text":"The first time I had Wild Papaya, I was a little nervous because I was working in branching out & trying something new! I have gone back several times & have yet to be disappointed! The service is always excellent as well as their food & atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Thai food and especially pad thai and it's usually the first thing I try when checking out a new restaurant. We were out of town and checked Yelp for Asian restaurants and found wild papaya and it had favorable reviews so thought we'd give it a try. It looked nice inside and out so we went on in. We've been eating earlier lately due to our schedule which tends to put us at the beginning of dinner service about 4:30-5:00 which can be tricky and I suspect this to have been the issue. My boyfriend and I both ordered the pad thai his with only chicken and mine with chicken and shrimp. Service was prompt and friendly and the food came out extremely fast... Too fast to have been made fresh fast! So first off the smell was unpleasant and I know that pad thai varies widely, but it smelled ripe. It had two small shrimp on mine and about 8-10 bite sized pieces of chicken and a reasonable amount of noodles in each serving even though my boyfriend ordered only chicken he had the same amount. The shrimp tasted bad, I mean how old are these shrimp bad. I'm not a complainer because I realize the wait staff are not responsible for the kitchen, but I mentioned the shrimp tasted bad and they didn't seem to understand that, by not fresh I wasn't referring to the fact they use frozen shrimp, it's Ohio I expect that, not borderline rotting though. The noodle texture was just awful slimy and the vegetables, the two of three actually in the dish were as limp as the noodles. Clearly we received food that had been cooked long before it had been served and paid dinner prices of just under $10 a serving. We took our chances eating some (I skipped the two lousy shrimp) since we were very hungry and in a rush and are now driving home wondering if we'll be sick tonight. We'll never come again and that's a shame since we're in the area often and like to find destination restaurants."}
