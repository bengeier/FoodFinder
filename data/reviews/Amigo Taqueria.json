{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviewers. There is nothing fancy about this spot but the food is absolutely delicious. I came for tacos and was not disappointed. I tried my two favorites which are carne asada and al pastor.  They were on house-made tortilla shells. The queso fundido was also divine. I would go on Tuesday as that's Taco Tuesday so all tacos no matter the meat are $1.50 each. This spot is a must try and is clearly not getting the attention it deserves. It's the most authentic Mexican experience I've had as someone born and raised in NC."}
{"text":"Best tacos hands down!! Fresh ingredients homemade tortillas! I really only come here for the tacos but I can imagine the rest is pretty good too! If you like authentic tacos like cilantro and onion and there green sauce is phenomenal.."}
{"text":"Found this place which is listed everywhere as Taco Express and recently re-opened under a new name. 

Staff was real nice and this place is the real deal. Real authentic mexican and gigantic portions. Being from San Diego this place reminded me of home. 

I got the campechano quesadilla and it was enough for two people. Friends got tacos and also loved them. 

Their hot sauces are also clearly home made and both the salsa verde and hot sauce were awesome. 

I wish I lived closer, id be eating here alot and its definitely going to be the choice for any trip to Charlotte from Raleigh."}
