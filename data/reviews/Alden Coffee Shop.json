{"text":"Gives the feeling of a nice homely cafe/diner from a while ago. Mainly due to the warmth of service and food. Definitely worth a stop if you're in that area of Markham or passing by on Alden Rd."}
{"text":"This quaint little eatery is in an area with few other places to grab a quick bite. They have a nice selection of sandwiches, burgers, salads and soup, fish and chips, gyros and souvlaki. They serve breakfast too and the proprietors are very friendly. There's daily lunch specials and if you ask, they'll even fax them over to you. The prices, however, are too high for the portion sizes of many of the menu items."}
{"text":"Great service, and great food.. Had the chicken clubhouse with fries and gravy... Nice home cooked feeling in this place.."}
{"text":"Very cute little cafe; it's very quaint and somehow it reminds me of my childhood. The people who work here are very nice and make good food. I had the breakfast which was amazing, I can say it was the best breakfast I've had in a long time. The portions aren't the biggest but it definitely sufficed my hunger. My friend got the steak on a kaiser and she said it was pretty good.  All in all I would give this a 4.5/5."}
