{"text":"Went here for the first  time and saw Maleficent. I recommend the H row. Perfect distance from screen and really comfy seats. My 4 year old stretched out and fell asleep. Fast service and fresh food too. A little pricey but no different than standard movie theaters. Better quality in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great place! I love their vegi plate and the popcorn is always yummy! Tuesdays are $2.00 off burgers and beers! Service is always good."}
{"text":"This place was very unimpressive. When it was the Mez it was much better. The quality of the food and service has gone down, the bathrooms were a mess and the theater wasn't even ready for us to enter until after the movie was supposed to start. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I got a deal through groupon for $5.  when I walked in the theater, I was surprised that some of the chairs were leather with trays and others were office chairs at a counter.  normally the ticket prices are $9.50, so I cant imagine paying that much for an office chair.  the food was ok, not great.  I had ordered the adult milk shake which was decent and had ordered a strawberry daiquiri which was way too sweet, but was large.  I also ordered chocolate chip cookies, which were alright. a little doughy and you get 4 in an order.  I would stay away from the food and bring your own in. food was overpriced and not tasty."}
{"text":"There should be disclaimers about obstructed views from the non bar seats. Just saw Star Wars and had to watch it through the back of someone's head the whole night!  Disappointing. Good service but popcorn was stale. Over all probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by the modern and sleek decor and design of the theater but the reason I give this theater three stars is because the actual movie experience itself was not up to par with the fancy facade you walk into.   They did not design this well. The seats were comfy, but close together. The tray your supposed to have your food on is tiny and not well designed. Ugh I felt like I was on an airplane! The way you order was so crappy. I was expecting to be ordering with a tablet, not with a crappy button that my waitress had to pull her phone out in order to see my menu so that they could take my order!   They really should invest in tablet ordering so all the waiters have to do is bring you your food.   Seriously, this is 2015. Get with the technological times."}
{"text":"This place deserves zero stars. Movies are great to see here if you catch the $5 special on Groupon. The food looks really good but when you actually get it, it's cold. My husband ordered a Carona with lime and never got the lime after asking twice for it. As we walked out of the movie all of the employees were just standing there eating, drinking and talking. No one said thanks, have a good night. I will be bring my own food and drinks next time."}
{"text":"Mike the manager took great care of us although we asked for something out of the ordinary. The food was good. I had the flatbread and a margarita! I would suggest the seats versus the counter. The counter seems like sitting at a desk 3D was awesome."}
{"text":"A cheaper version of iPic. You get to choose your seat when you purchase your ticket. More comfy seating than your average theatre. A bar to enjoy a pre movie drink. The food is subpar. Think Applebee's quality. Other than that I always choose this theatre if they are showing a movie that I want to see."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location since it opened as The Mez. In the last year the service standards have dropped beyond poor. Tonight was the final time I will go to SMG. I'm a new mom. My husband and I got a sitter so we could sneak out and see a late showing of Spiderman. The movie was supppsed to start at 10:45. We arrived early and at 10:38 we were told to go wait in the lounge. They had not cleaned the theater from the previous showing. We were allowed in and the movie began at 11:05pm. I could understand a delay if the theater were busy, but it was a Wednesday night. We had had plenty of time in advance to decide so we were the first people to place our food & drinks order. 11:05 movie starts 11:40 I flagged down a server to ask where our order was. She said she would notify the manager and never came back. There were only about 15 customers in the theater. 12:05 I flagged down the person who took our order. I told him every other person had been served and asked where ours was. He said he'd check. He came back five minutes later handed me 2 movie passes and said the manager would speak with us after the movie. He never offered to bring us food or even our drinks. No apology. No explanation. We sat there through the end of the credits until we were the last 2 people in the theater. No manager. When we left we didn't see anyone in the hallway either. I'm beyond disappointed. What was supposed to be a little getaway was ruined. Because I'm a breastfeeding mother I need to have lots of water to drink all of the time. This was the worst experience of several that we've had over the last year. They've lost a couple of long term customers."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Given the reviews, I was kind of leery; but a $5 ticket via Groupon to see a currently-out blockbuster (Skyfall, in this case) and I couldn't pass it up. Glad I didn't.  First off, I didn't see any problem with \"clearing time\" or whatever as other reviewers pointed out. We got into our movie at the right time with no delays. Second, I loved the seating; I was in a swivel office chair with the bar-like thing in front of me to lean on for added comfort. Most movie theater seats have me fidgeting, and this set-up kept me in comfort the whole showing.  Finally, with the Groupon $5 in non-stop swing, why *wouldn't* you go to this place? I get they're probably doing the Groupon thing perpetually to draw people in who want to buy the ridiculously-priced food and drinks ($12 for a crabcake appetizer), but if you're like me and just want to see a movie in a theater this is a no-brainer."}
{"text":"We came here because the movie we wanted to see was in 2D here and at our fave AMC it was 3D. The customer service was ok; the website was not allowing me to order my tickets in advance so I called and was told there wasn't anything that could be done on their end. We arrived and purchased our tickets at the box office an hour early and had a drink at the bar until our theater was open. The bartender was nice but MIA when it came time to close our tab. The theater itself seemed outdated and we weren't told at the box office our seats were actually only computer desk chairs at a counter. Seriously...we paid to sit in a computer desk chair. They allowed us to switch our seats to another row but that meant we had to split up our group. Had we been told about the seating situation prior we probably would've been able to get us all together considering we purchased the tickets an hour early. The food was ok. The appetizers were by far better than the dinner options. Guess it's hard to mess up pretzel bites. All in all I think we'll stick with AMC for our future dinner/movie theaters."}
{"text":"Not bad. In general, a good movie going experience. A few things of note:  We bought \"VIP\" seats - on the map, it shows that is the first three rows. However, the \"VIP\" seats are smaller, more narrow than the remaining seats (\"non\" VIP, if you will), and there wasn't anything particularly \"VIP\" about them. They don't recline or have foot rests - not sure what makes them VIP.  A misleading description.   I've read articles where the owner of SMG states that they are a \"chef driven\" concept. I suggest they invest in new inspiration. Chicken tenders are pre-breaded, frozen. Burger patties, pre-formed, frozen. The spinach dip is literally straight out of the bag (Nestle's Spinach Artichoke Dip). The tortilla chips are freshly made - strips cut from a 6\"round corn tortilla and fried. The smothered french fry appetizer was served very nicely, and hot, though the \"cheese\" on them was a spicy, non-scratch made product.   There is only one restroom available to movie goers (at least on my visit). They had bouncers blocking off part of the second floor (where the billiards tables are) when our movie was over, so even if we wanted to hang out. have a few more drinks, we weren't allowed to - without explanation. (this was about 10pm).  Overall, the movie was great, we enjoyed our experience, as it was our first in that meal served with movie type. But after reading some of the reviews here and from articles about SMG, it definitely was lackluster result from the buildup."}
{"text":"If only I could give this overpriced overrated rathole 0 stars.. Let me start out by saying that Taco Bell has better food and at 1/5 of the price. Not only does the lobby smell like a sewage drain, the bathroom smells like a barn with urine all over the floor. The only reason we went there is for the assigned seating, we wanted to make sure we had good spots for American Sniper. However, upon presenting our tickets to the teenage brat behind the podium, we were informed that our newborn baby, who spends his entire life so far asleep, was not welcome, a policy that was reenforced by the manager. Would have been nice to know that babies are not permitted before spending money and time at this joke of an establishment. Thankfully Ultrastar right down the 101 isn't run by a bunch of incompetent children and we were able to see our movie there. We don't get to get out a lot, we also have a 3 year old who was at grandma's for the night, because we didn't want him to see the movie or disturb other customers, a decision I made with my own discretion. This night was planned out in advance and nearly ruined because SMG doesn't think I can control my own children. I have said it before but I mean it this time, we will never be going to SMG again, and we will encourage all of our friends to steer clear as well."}
{"text":"$1.50 for soda water? Come on. Also Why does it take so long to get a drink from the bar? Ordered before the previews and didn't get it until 30 minutes into the movie. Had to ask 3 separate times. Staff was rude."}
{"text":"Some quick prices/info before I start my review: - $9.75 for adult tickets in the afternoon or evening, $8.50 for matinees. - $11 for a reserved adult ticket in the afternoon or evening, $8 for reserved seat for children and seniors. - $5 for morning movies. - $9 to $12.50 for salads, pizzas, sandwiches and appetizers. Kids meals are $5.95. - $4.50 for domestic draft beers, $15 for a pitcher. - $7 to $12 for wine by the glass, $21 to $100 per bottle. - $8 and up for margaritas, $26 for a pitcher. - $4.25 for buttered popcorn.  Ok, we went to SMG last night for drinks and a late movie. When we first walked in I was beyond excited to experience a reasonably priced dine/drink in movie. The bar area was great and the staff was very friendly. We hung out in the lounge area for about an hour eating and drinking until our movie began seating.  Once in the theater, everything went downhill fast!  We decided to sit in the back row in an oversized (very firm) chair. This decision was based mainly on the fact that our only alternative was a rolly office chair. WHAT you ask? Correct. Uncomfortable, office chairs were in the theater. Weird to say the least.  We, along with the other patrons, continued to order drinks and food in the theater. Big mistake. The theater is not set up correctly for employees to be walking around delivering food/drinks, discussing orders, and dropping checks. I was so distracted by the massive number of people walking back and forth in front of me that I started counting them! After about 30 minutes of counting, I had reached 41 times that an employee walked in front of me to attend to something. I understand that it is their job, and it was the first night, but I was so distracted that I left the movie frustrated and not knowing what I had just watched.  All in all, I want to like this place. It is in a great location and the staff was friendly. I also loved the bar aspect. I plan to go back in a few weeks after they have had time to work out the kinks and see if my movie watching experience improves."}
{"text":"Loved it great spot good food and loved a Beer with my movie"}
{"text":"Went again last night with two friends with the intention of catching the 8pm showing of The Campaign.  (Yep, had Groupons to redeem again.)  Unfortunately, most of the shows were sold out and we went with the first available one; the 8:30pm showing of Premium Rush.    The place is definitely more packed in the evening than in the morning/afternoon.  We got our tickets around 7:40 and hung around the bar until called to the waiting line for our show.  Apparently there are three lines and staff will make an announcement when the line is open for your movie (usually 20-30mins before show time).  Oh yeah - if you pay for reserved seating, you don't have to wait in line.  You'll be escorted by staff to your seat(s).    I noticed there are more staff in the evening and they were quite busy throughout the show.  We ordered three skinny coconut coladas ($9.50 each), the chopped salad ($12.25), the Build Your Own starter, and three sodas (to use up the free drink tickets).    The coladas were good and strong enough.  The chopped salad and BYO starter were decently sized, which was a nice surprise.  The dressing for the chopped salad was good and with the fresh ingredients, made each bite good (could have done with less blue cheese though).    For the BYO starter (we get up to four items), we chose the coconut chicken tenders, spicy drummettes, burger bites, and smoked ribs.  You basically get a half order for each.  We got a decent portion - three dummettes, two burger bites, three smoked ribs, and four coconut tenders (also had a big side of ranch).  I was surprised at how tender the ribs were and how tasty everything was - definitely worth the $15.25.    I enjoyed both experiences at SMC and will be going back."}
{"text":"2nd time going here, went to see starwars this time. Was starving when i sat down so I ordered food and drink. Drink immediately came out, but after almost an hour and a half of waiting on my food i decided to walk out without finishing my movie. Am happily eating wings and drinking beer at wild wing cafe, conveniently right next door!"}
{"text":"My experience is from when Studio Movie Grill opened to 2012.  Studio Movie Grill only made me miss Farrelli's Cinema Supper Club even more.  Farrelli's had character, great food, great drinks and great customer service.  It was a true delight to see a show at Farrelli's.  SMG, opening weekend was good.  Customer service that weekend was great, the place looks great, the drink selection was good, the food menu was okay.  Ordered some drinks and food.  The drinks were okay, the food seemed like it was purchased frozen from Costco down the street and warmed up in a microwave and covered in sauce.  Went a few weeks later for another try.  Customer service had gone down the tubes.  Servers would half-ass take orders and disappear and bring incorrect food.  After asking for the correct thing it was 30 minutes or more before it showed up.  I continued to give SMG a shot, missing the Farrelli's experience and hoping they would at least get the Customer Service back they had on opening weekend.  I went there three more times and each time was as bad or worse then the second time.  Poor service, and nothing really to redeem it.  Subpar food, overpriced...  Not worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is terrific and they have a full bar. The seats are comfortable and you have all the leg room you need. We never have had to ask for anything twice, the servers are definitely on top of it. I love hanging at the bar in the lounge area before the movie. We've been waiting for a theater like this for a long time. We stopped going to the local Harkins and only come here now. Get the cheeseburger it is OUTSTANDING!   Only thing I'd change is the location. We drive from Chandler and would love one down here!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place. They bring the popcorn and soda right to your seat. However, they are really pushing meals. Who wants to eat a salad in the dark or almost dark. Which is another  problem. The blue night lights, so people can find their food. The wait staff are always walking through and interacting with the customers. Overall found the experience distracting and won't be back. I can see families or people that like to have food/ drinks delivered to your seat enjoying this option."}
{"text":"Ok, yes, it's novel.  To have food and drinks served to you in comfy chairs with your own desk.  But trust me, buy your tickets on Groupon for $5 to prevent any disappointment.  The place obviously wants to make its money by movie-goers buying food and beverages  If you don't want to buy food or drinks there, don't go because they'll pester you until you do.   It is also clear they make money off the food because I'm pretty sure everything I have ever ordered here was frozen and was of McDonald's quality.  The profit margin is probably pretty high for such low quality food.  The first time I went, I ordered a salad.  Ingredients were cheap and tasteless.  The second time I ordered the Coconut Chicken & Shrimp and was horribly let down by limp, mushy fries with no ketchup and the overcooked chicken and shrimp.  If the waiters walking up and down the theater wasn't distracting enough, the sound was SO LOUD!  I actually plugged up my ears in the action sequences in Guardians of the Galaxy.  Really?    I will take my mom here just to show her what it's like but that will be the last time I go to SMG."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to see Dark Knight.  No problem with seating.  We go during the days and was mostly empty.  We were there on Thursday which is unlimited pizza.  We ordered 3 differently types of thin crust pizzas and they all tasted the same and were terrible.  Everything was cold, from crust to all the toppings.  We didn't send back as we were very hungry and it had taken a long time to get.  Also, I have not decided if this was the actual movie or Studio Movie Grill but we could not hear half the dialog because of the THUMPING sound tract.  Felt I've experienced this somewhere once before & I believe it is the theater and not the film.  We both think it was a good movie and look forward to getting it on DVD so we can listen to it a 2nd time and catch the story line. Got the tickets on Groupon and thought it worth a try.  I would never go back."}
{"text":"The reason I gave SMG one star is because it's a really neat place, great seating and great concept (Pacific Northwest has been doing this for years btw) but the service and food was HORRIBLE!    Granted, it was Valentine's evening, I don't care.  If a business can't serve a packed house (knowing it's going to be a busy night), then sell a smaller number of seats to accommodate the number of employees working able to handle it...plain and simple.  We ordered our food and after everyone else got served and ate their food, we were still waiting for a good 45 minutes later for ours!  Finally, we decided to cancel our order.  Well, they comped our food and our food came out approx 15 minutes later...COLD!  It makes me wonder if they retrieved it from the trash?  I'm being serious.  On top of that, the food was the worst I've ever had.  Pizza was served on some kind of a big 9 inch cracker with dried out cold chicken on it and the potato skins were cold too but tasted like the ones you'd get in your grade school cafeteria.  So, I'd go again for the nice chairs, seating and ambiance, but I'd stop at a local watering hole first to have a few drinks and good hot food.  Even if the food was warm, it'd still be bad.  Who serves pizza on a large cracker?  Lavosh is much better.  Couldn't they have at least done that???"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy coming here for date nights.  I think the best part is that you can buy $5 tickets on groupon!  Yay!  You can also pick your seats ahead of time, but you have to pay around $1.25 or so in order to do that.  To us, it is totally worth is because it seems like we are always running late and it's awful getting bad seats in a movie.  It's still cheaper that going to a regular movie theater.  The menu is decent too and surprisingly not overpriced.  I like being able to order an adult beverage while watching a movie.  I would suggest like all the other reviewers did to get the lounge type seating instead of the counter area with the office chair.  My husband is extremely tall and he had so much leg room."}
{"text":"I didn't know whether to watch a movie or make a conference call. Don't get the tabletop seats. It has all the charm of watching a movie at Kinko's."}
{"text":"Monday July 4th my wife, daughter and I decided to go to Studio Movie Grill.  Let me just say worst decision ever.  You would think they would have been better staffed for a holiday weekend.  We arrived for our 2:30 movie at 2:00 pm and stood in line for 15 minutes just to get our parking validated(we had already bought our tickets online) because they only had one person working the ticket desk. The line for persons buying tickets or just to get parking validated was out the door.  Note: this is a common occurrence when I've been other times. Finally got into the theater and pushed the service button to place an order.  There were only about 10 people in the theater at the time and we waited another 20 minutes just for someone to come take our order.  When the server did come to take our order we were told there were only 2 servers for all 5 theaters that day.  What manager thought that was a good idea?!  Placed our order for food and drinks and didn't receive our food  until the movie was half over and it was cold.  Got our food and no drinks.  Had to press the service button again to ask where our drinks were.  Got our drinks after we were pretty much done eating.  Movie ends and we have not received our check.  Walk out to the front of the theater to ask for the check and see trays of food sitting at the entrance to the theater which others had ordered and not gotten during the movie.  RIDICULOUS!!!!! There are vast improvements that can be made at this establishment.  Oh and don't bother complaining on their website. You will just get a generic email from their corporate office stating someone will contact you and you'll never hear another word from them."}
{"text":"A very urban moviegoing experience. Take a normal theater and add pricey, messy, and inefficient food service. The food has a very microwave feel to it, and while the floors aren't sticky like in many theaters, the lack of cleaning between food services leaves a grimy feeling. This place was way better when it was mez but you can still get a drink during a movie which is nice. Typical of Charlotte, most people are taking up server time ordering water."}
{"text":"Went last week after buying the $5 Groupon for one ticket plus a soda.  You get a better seating group if you buy your ticket earlier so that was cool.  The food prices are not bad considering how expensive food is in regular theaters (about $7-$15 depending on what you want).    There was a slight hiccup with our order where we got our food first but had to wait 20 minutes before our drinks came (after repeatedly asking servers where they were).  Our food was cold by then but after talking to a manager, they brought out a fresh order and they comped our meal.    Also, management handed out free passes as we were walking out since there was a cricket chirping during the movie (which didn't really bother me).  All in all, I would recommend this place since you can have a decent meal with your movie, the servers are super friendly, and because management seems to actually care about customer service."}
{"text":"Trendy cool place!  Beer and a movie: brilliant!  Good staff, prompt service, nice seats (thou a little dirty) and decent price.  Would recommend"}
{"text":"Woah, Darlene really hit the nail on the head.  We were waiting for the same movie/time, and I couldn't agree more.  Our experience began with the first employee we came into contact with...a young girl at the box office.  She was unfriendly and annoyed by the fact that she had to do a little extra work to type in our groupon codes.  After being shuttled into three lines to wait to enter the theater, I felt like I was ready to board my flight.  I mean, see my movie.  Once in, it was a free for all with people running to grab the nearest seat.  I was not aware that I was in for a game of musical chairs.  The chairs we ended up with were 5 feet from the screen.  I cannot believe they sell tickets for these seats, as they seemed like an afterthought.  Did I mention they were computer chairs?  Mind you, my husband and I had showed up an hour and twenty minutes before the movie time.  We left before the previews began, and went to the Harkins down the street.  If you want a good Eat & Drink movie theater, I would not waste your time here, and go to the Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the concept of a dine-in movie theater. My first experience with one was at the AMC Esplanade, where the leather seats are huge and reclining, and the food comes out promptly and piping hot. I assumed this would be the same kind of experience. It was not. I've been to the SMG a few times, and each experience is very different from the next. Service is hit and miss, as well as wait times for tickets and food.   SMG has some great stuff going for it - the full bar is awesome if you get there early and want to relax before your movie starts. A big plus is that there is basically always a Groupon available (don't ever pay full price when you can get a ticket and a drink for $5. If it's not available right now, wait a week and it will show up again.) The menu is above average - very similar to Chilis or Applebees.   I went with my parents and my boyfriend last week on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. We stood in line for about 20 minutes to get our tickets. (This is not a normal occurance - normally we get right in) When we got to the front of the line and asked the girl selling tickets why it was so packed, she rolled her eyes and said the Groupon expires tomorrow. She seemed very annoyed by this. Which is fair, because I think everyone in line was annoyed by it too.    This was the first time we sat in the office chairs, and I actually liked it better than the other seats. There was more room and the table was much bigger. Just a personal preference. We ordered our food and the waiter seemed knowledgable and friendly. We settled in for the movie and waited for our food. And we waited. And waited. And then we waited some more. It was about 45 minutes into the movie by the time we got our meals. I understand it was a full theater, but it was wayyy too long to cook up a couple of bugers and chicken fingers. When our food came out, my boyfriend's chicken fingers were ice cold. He pushed his light (which it says to do on the screen before  the movie starts - \"For immediate service, push your button and turn on your light\") About 10 minutes passed before anyone came over to help us. The waiter handled it well and said he would get a new plate right out to us. Then came the waiting. 20 more minutes passed before his food came. I've worked in food service before, and when a customer sends a meal back, it should be your first priority to replace it and remedy the situation. Not so much at the Studio Movie Grill.   Overall, I would say this is a good place to go for a night out if you have a Groupon. It's cheap and very cool in its concept.   But a tip for the gentlemen - do not take a date here if you are trying to impress her. Go to the AMC dine-in theater...it is much more cozy and has significantly less problems with service.   In summary -- food: average. ambiance: average. service: below average."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to see a movie... The theater was comfortable, and nice. The food was great... This is what all movie theater should be..."}
{"text":"My first experience with Studio Movie Grill (SMG), sparked by a Groupon deal, was very good. The theater is designed to accommodate a movie-dining experience as there was a centralized kitchen to accommodate food & drink orders from all the theaters. As an engineer, let me first say that one must appreciate the challenge of marrying a walk-in movie theater experience with a full service restaurant. Once I put that in perspective I began to understand the disparity of reviews read online. One must modify their expectations because running a movie theater like a full service restaurant requires you to do some things differently. I must say, however, that SMG did a pretty good job of meshing these two entities.  As the goal of any business is to make money there are some differences from conventional theaters. One is there's no conventional concession stand; this encourages you to buy food from the menu which averages about $10 per entrée. You can enjoy a wide variety of drinks and cocktails, but just expect your bill to escalate accordingly. As there is \"personal\" waiter service, tipping is also expected. However you're not mandated to buy anything so if you want to enjoy just the movie, you can. Secondly, you're queued up in groups, first come-first served, to enter the movie theater, so it behooves you to get there early. Being early encourages you to spend money at the lobby bar. The seating capacity of the theater is smaller than typical because generous aisles between the rows of seats are needed for serving, as well as additional space needed for meal settings. Also, seats can be reserved in advance on-line and at theater lobby kiosks (~ $2 extra - I think there's also a cut-off of approx. 2 hrs. before show time), so available open seating can become scarce rapidly. General admission \"non-reserved seating\" ticket prices appear to match those of conventional theaters, with matinee and pre-noon discounts. I would imagine a few bad experiences with open seating would encourage one to reserve seating in advance. Seating alternates row by row between fixed high back cushioned seats with a large swing out tray, or a continuous formica counter spanning the entire row having individual rolling high back cushioned office style chairs with arms.    My family attended a Sunday matinee and arrived about 20 minutes before show time. We were queued into third group \"C\", and only waited about 10-15 minutes to enter the theater. Our seating was good, however, as we found open seating about two-thirds to the rear of the theater, just off center. We sat at a counter row in office chairs.  We actually liked it because you have your own seat with dedicated armrests; also the swivel, tilt/rock, and height motions enhanced our movie experience. Seats were comfortable. A bonus was no one kicking the back of your seat and no arm wrestling with a neighbor over the armrest. We ordered food (pizza, potato skins, and chicken sandwich). The counter area was ample while the food quality was average to good.  Seemed pricey, but tis to be expected at a movie theater. Service is summoned via illuminated buttons to notify the staff. I used the service button 4 times and found good responsiveness within approx. 5 minutes of pressing. Waiters were discreet and pleasant. The waiter's movements within the theater were not distracting as they moved swiftly and quietly amongst patrons. The food bill was delivered about two-thirds through the movie, and aside from an error of not discounting the Groupon soft drinks (corrected) the billing process was efficient. A tip is to bring a pocket flashlight to help view your food and bill.  I might mention soft drinks were $3 with unlimited refills - probably the best value in the theater. Our food bill was $32 including tip and drink discounts.  The negatives were that there should be more theater information available for 1st timers. Asking questions allayed our confusion, but it was apparent that the lobby staff was not totally up to snuff and could use a bit more training. It probably takes a few visits to refine a strategy for getting the best seats with minimal wait times. Also, I felt the bathrooms were smaller than necessary for the number of theaters they had.  The theater audio-visual movie experience was superb and as good as any theater I've been to. I believe the negative comments about \"office chairs\" and service are unwarranted. While the experience may vary depending on crowds, I'm sure there are a few process kinks left to be worked out. I could imagine a Friday/ Saturday date night with a popular first run movie might tax the system. While the SMG experience can get pricey, they probably execute this combo movie-dining experience probably the best I've seen so far, with good trade-offs between comfort, environment, and costs.  I've been to Farelli's and also iPic in Scottsdale, while nice, were REALLY pricey.  My experience was positive enough to warrant a return visit."}
{"text":"Terrible!!  The food was awful- husband had chicken nachos which tasted like canned chicken, I had an almost burnt to a crisp burger, fries were cold and soggy. Waitresses hit me on the head several times walking by with trays. Stay away!!  There's a reason they have discount tickets available all the time!!  If you're looking for a dine in theater, go to iPic or AMC Esplanade!"}
{"text":"Half the movie theater are rows of office chairs. Came here expecting the usual dine-in movie experience with plush, reclining seats. Instead, walked in and felt like I was attending a work conference. What's worse is that it feels like the movie theater is purposely trying to hide the fact that the movie theater is office chair seating as it is not stated anywhere on the website! Skip this place"}
{"text":"I love this place. It so cool that you can drink and eat be waited on while watching a movie. The seats are comfortable and if you want to talk and eat they have plenty of seating around the bar to enjoy before your movie"}
{"text":"I would probably give this place 3.5 stars.  I am rounding up to 4 stars because the prices are much more reasonable that other \"dinner movie theaters.\" Also, the service is friendly and fast, and the menu options are pretty good. The food also seems a bit cheaper than other similar places.  The food however isn't amazing. It seems to be slightly better than other places we have been to, and they are somewhat generous with their portions. While some of the seating is more normal, regular chairs, there are also seating options that are office chairs. They are comfortable ones, but at times it can be a bit awkward when you swivel into your neighbor or try to get comfortable.  I will continue to go here though for this type of experience, as the prices are so reasonable. It's also very clean!"}
{"text":"I got a groupon for this place, I'm having a hard time deciding where to start with my horror story.  First off- I walked into a line all the way to the door and only 1 person working the ticket booth. After waiting in like for 20 minutes I was told to use the kiosk off to the side and that it would still honor my groupon, I proceeded to get out of line and try that instead. Unfortunately the kiosk would not honor the groupon and I had to get back in a line that was backed up to the door for a second time. 40 minutes later I was in my seat and had already missed the beginning of the movie, even though I got to the theater 20 minutes early.  Here you'd think they probably can't mess anything else up, unfortunately they can. I turned on my order light and waited while one waiter turned off my light, said he'd be right back, took someone else's order and left. So I turned on my light back on, waited another 8 minutes and finally was able to order 2 sodas and popcorn. It took 23 minutes to get the sodas (at this point I was pissed and keeping time) and the popcorn still hadn't come. I turned my light on to mention it again in case they forgot- the waitress sighed and said she'd just clocked in and someone else should be getting it. So 45 minutes into the movie and after ordering, checks were already being passed out for people to pay and my popcorn was just getting to my seat. I then had to pay 25 dollars in parking because their employee threw away my parking pass and validation.  I spoke to the manager after the movie and she did not offer any help. Needless to say I won't be going back. And I strongly urge you to stay away. Rude employees, Bad management, Slow service, and over priced food and drinks. There's a reason this place always has a groupon."}
{"text":"I went to see a movie here today and was surprised on how they fixed this theatre up and made it look very presentable. This theatre is a full service theatre therefore they have employees there to take your order on food and drinks and bring them to you. They pride themselves on \"immediate\" service. Myself and the people I was with ordered drinks and popcorn before the movie even started along with the people sitting next to me. Half way through the movie I still hadn't received my order so I complained to a person working there and they forgot my whole order, obviously I was pissed. The same thing happened to the people next to me. This theatre is not worth it if you are going to spend money and expect good service. I would not go back there, if your going to go to a theatre like this I recommend IPic which is nicer and has good service."}
{"text":"Go to the esplanade AMC in the Biltmore instead, better service and seats. Studio movie grill installed new seats and they do not recline and are not comfortable. Service at studio movie grill is poor overall, they should just have a concession stand unless they plan on drastically improving their service."}
{"text":"I was worried with all the reviews but so happy with our experience. We used the online groupon code & reserved seats for an extra fee. It was so worth it! The theatre was so much cleaner than most other theaters & more modern. The seats were new and the staff very helpful. The menu was extensive & such a good idea for those wanting a dinner & a movie experience all in one. Genius.  We would definitely go back. Make sure you choose the A/B seats, they come with a swivel table, cup holder, & large armrests. The C seats all share a counter with rolling office chairs."}
{"text":"I took my family here for the first time a couple weeks ago.. We had so much fun.  The experience was different.  The menu was good for being a movie theatre.  The prices are a little high but they have to make there money somehow. We will be going back again real soon."}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! My favorite movie theater hands down! The tickets are similar in price to any other theater, the food is amazing, and the atmosphere is unlike any other. I love the fact that you can have dinner and a movie and a cocktail while watching the latest movies. Everything in this theater is reasonably priced and the chairs (loveseats) are so comfy. Who ever came up with the idea to provide service at the touch of a button during a movie is a genious!   This isn't a place for families in my opinion, but a great place for date night or an outing with your bestfriend."}
{"text":"Watching movies at SMG was great, but I will agree with the other reviewers about the bad service for dinner. My husband and I went here tonight and read the reviews ahead of time, so we knew what we were walking in to. We ordered the raspberry crush mojito from the menu before the show, and the bartender didn't know what it was. We ended up getting drinks with no raspberries or mint and not resembling mojitos at all. We ordered just popcorn and cheese fries for the show. The popcorn came right away, but the fries didn't show up for a while, and when they did, they weren't hot. We asked to send them back, but they never came. We asked them what happened and when they finally arrived they were hot, and the server apologized profusely and removed it from the bill. Sketchy service at best and I am guessing this is due to not having dedicated servers, and rather a pool of servers running about.i will mention the cheese fries were good once they came out hot."}
{"text":"I have to say what are you thinking SMG? You went from comfortable, rocking recliner like chairs, with plenty of leg room,  to a chair right off the exit row of a plane. The backs of the chair are hard molded at a 2 inch recline. The sides armrest are high, hard and unmovable insuring no contact with the person next to you. So great if you don't like the people in your row, sucks if your on a date. And last but not least, you added rows and chairs so the seats are narrow and the rows impossible to exit. In a time when theaters are working hard to give movie goers something better then there home theater why is SMG going retro.  I would say to nights movie experiences was like watching a movie at my grandmas kitchen table. Food is good and delivered with a smile but still no place I want to sit with a date for two and a half hours, even if Matt Damon is one of the dinner guest."}
{"text":"The facility was very clean and the quality of service was just what we expected. The popcorn could use far less butter, given it was dripping off my fingers. I love movies and a good experience and this establishment provides both."}
{"text":"I saw quite a few bad reviews about this place so I was a little nervous. My boyfriend and I went to watch the dragon ball z movie and this was one of the few theaters showing it so I sort of had to give it a try. I saw comments that it wasn't very clean especially the bathrooms. It looks like this place had also seen those and definitely started working on that. I ended up using both women's bathrooms and they were both extremely clean! I'm not a big fan of the office chairs so thank goodness we didn't end up in those. Service was pretty good and so was the food. We did the 2 for $25 which was a great deal. We got spinach artichoke dip, chicken tenders and I got the pepperoni pizza. It was all pretty good. My bf definitely speaks his mind and this place got his approval which kinda means a lot. It's pretty fr from me but I'd go again."}
{"text":"First Timer here.  I used the infamous Groupon to take my hubby to see Premium Rush.  We went early on a Sunday and had a great time.  He ordered the ribs & I ordered the chicken nachos.  Food was kinda pricey but definitely delicious.  Seriously surprised!  This was a nice experience, friendly staff, cool concept.  Definitely won't make it a regular thing because we live in Tempe, but it'll be nice to come up & enjoy it every once in a while.  Tip** If you get the chicken nachos, make sure to ask for extra chips.  It's loaded with toppings."}
{"text":"This was my first time at SMG and it was an horrible experience. The website says arrive 20mins early so we did. The movie was supposed to start at 9:45 but they didn't let us in the theater until 9:50 because they were still cleaning from the previous movie. So the movie started 30mins late (10:15). My food came out cold so I sent it back...never received the new one. They charged my card for the entire thing but the manager did go back and take care of my entire check. He was extremely nice and apologetic about my experience and gave us two movie passes on top of taking care of the check. During the movie you could hear the servers on the side having conversation and laughing. One customer yelled \"shut the $;&: up!\" I've heard good things about this place and wanted to check it out, but unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations."}
{"text":"I love how you're able to order drinks, get cheap tickets on groupon, and eat food while watching your movie! The seats are super comfortable and they can turn into love seats if you're there with your significant other. Love this theater and try to go see as much movies as possible there!"}
{"text":"Whats up with the office roll around chairs? No head rest, uncomfortable, feels like im working and not watching a movie. Could not relax the whole time."}
{"text":"The overall experience at studio movie grill was enjoyable. Cool lounge and bar area before going in to see your movie. Drinks are priced reasonably, as are the food items. And the food was pretty tasty.  That being said... This is not a theater for true cinephiles... The contrast and picture quality were greatly degraded. The image seemed back washed and way too much white light drowned out the image.   Sound quality was O.K. It was a cool for a comedy movie ... And would perhaps be cool for dramas.  ...Anything other than Sci Fi, or any film where video quality is at the forefront of the presentation.  I would not go to see a new blockbuster movie like Transformers or Maleficent here. I would have issues with the presentation.   I enjoyed my night out at SMG, but purists be warned... Video quality is Not up to spec."}
{"text":"Its a great place for the movies, but the food is not so great! The pizza that we ordered came not done well and we had to wait for it to be re-done. Next time I am eating out and then coming back for the moview."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great place to take a date, hang out with friends, take my niece and nephew to also. Chairs are really comfy, sound system is nice too. Love the dinner and drink options. Burgers were really good and desserts were on point. Staff is always friendly, I'm now a regular visitor to this place!"}
{"text":"Great prices and great food. Comfy chairs and constant service.  What more do you need at the movies!  Not as fancy as IPIC but for the price I find more value here than anywhere else.   Also nice that I can always find a groupon for half off!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. Seating was really uncomfortable.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Me and my Fiance went to the Star Wars movie. Came in. Went to our seats, and the seats were numbered wrong first off. I spent 5 minutes debating with another couple which seat is ours. The waiter said we could switch with the couple so we did. It was unnecessary confusion.. The waiter took my order immediately. Drinks soon came out. Me and my fiance then waited 1.5 hours for our entrees and appetizers which all came out at the same time. A waitress looked at me and was talking and i asked her what the problem was and she showed her back to me and didn't acknowledge me. I had to ask 5 waiters where my food was. What made it worse was their menu didn't have half of the listed food because a oven blew up. My food was cold and my mixed drink felt like it been left out for a hour then served to me. Only reason I am giving it a 2 star and not 1 is because the waiter comped my meal. It was a nice gesture, but waiting a hour and a half when i was hungry ruined the movie for me and the wait was not worth the product you got. I wont be returning again."}
{"text":"This is not the nicest dine-in theater we've tried, but it had the best service. The layout of the theater we were in was nice. It looked like good views of the screen all around. The seats were sort of comfortable, but oddly rocked back without reclining. I definitely recommend booking your seat online to get a seat not at a counter. Those did not look as comfortable.  The food we got was pretty good for eat-in-the-dark fare. Very good potato skins and steak sandwich, alright chicken tenders. The food is quite expensive, but that is the fate of this kind of novelty.  What really stood out here was the service. We had our order taken quickly and the appetizer was out quickly. We lit the service button twice: once to order food and once for drink refills. Both requests were attended to quickly and without making a huge disrupting fuss in the middle of our movie. All of the staff seemed to make a real effort to move quickly and/or duck down as they moved about."}
{"text":"I loved this place, we get groupons and go.  The last time we went they changed the menu , downsized the portions.  Not worth the drive from Gilbert."}
{"text":"My first expedience at a dinner movie theatre. Not very impressed. Very limited on the movie selection. Only 4 choices at a major downtown mall location. As a biz traveler, I'm looking for a good movie and popcorn. Dinner was expensive and lot of disruptions with meals delivered around me during the movie.  I won't do a dinner movie again"}
{"text":"Great experience! We just moved to town and wanted to catch a movie. I was pleased to find this theater nearby. I had been to a theater similar to this on the East Coast, but this one is much better. The food was quite good (I had a mushroom swiss burger) and the service was pretty fast and very friendly. They have a bar in the lobby and then each seat inside the theater has a \"service\" button where you can order whatever you like anytime. Prices were quite reasonable and they had a lot of ads on the screens that mentioned different promotion days/events that seemed to have great prices. I found my chair very comfortable and the food tray worked very well. They also have roll-up chairs where you can choose to sit at a table (like a conference room). I'm also a big fan of reserved seating.   I hope this place is around for a long time. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"no thanks. half of the seats in the theater are office chairs, no joke.  too many other great movie theaters in scottsdale to waste your money on this one."}
{"text":"It was my first experience with dinner and movie, facilities were clean, wait staff was very friendly. However, the one thing that is marketed, which is dinner and a movie, was a bust. The movie was great, but I placed my food order only for it not to be delivered at all, while my two other friends received their food just as expected. The wait staffed failed to even ask me if I had an order and just walked off, not to mentioned we asked for 3 additional drinks, which never came out.  I would have been better off just going to a restaurant first, and then going to a movie."}
{"text":"The first few visits here, we enjoyed it. The food was always delicious, the service was great, the movie is fun. No complaints, really.  But, just recently, we went for a family date night with our 4 year old and experienced the WORST service we've ever had. Not to mention the pizza was gross.   We were the first to be seated in the theater, and ordered first because we already knew what we wanted. Our first round of drinks, and the popcorn, were out immediately, but 45 minutes later our food was finally delivered. The coconut chicken tenders were fine, they always are, but the BBQ chicken pizza was so ordinary. Is it made fresh? It tasted like a frozen pizza. Not to mention, I asked if it was possible to take the cilantro off and the dude said yes. There was SO MUCH cilantro on my pizza. You know, not everyone likes cilantro :( So we were enjoying the movie, but were all thirsty again, we pushed the button to order drinks, but no one came (20 minutes went by), so we pushed the button again and finally had our drinks to us in 5 minutes. We went through 4 different servers, when usually we only have one.  The entire experience was a drag, the movie was cute, but the service was HORRIBLE. Super slow and unfriendly."}
{"text":"My best friend and I decided to do a double date with our boyfriends who are also really good friends. We even found a groupon deal! When we walked in, I was impressed with how nice it looked. The girl, Alex, at the front was very rude and monotone. She seemed liked a classic snooty spoiled scottsdale girl.  There was a deal going on 2 for $25, appetizer and two entrees. The four of us all ordered at the same time. My boyfriend and I got our appetizer what seemed like only minutes later. And it was more on the cold side. My friend did not receive her appetizer until ten minutes later when her meal arrive along side it. I did not receive my meal for another 10 minutes which was the pesto chicken pasta and a side caesar. I went to take a bite out of my caesar (mind you, it already being dark inside the theatre at this point) and was shocked to be eating dry ice berg lettuce. I pressed my button and five minutes later a guy came up and apologized and asked if I wanted to keep this salad and just bring out the dressed or an entirely new salad. I said I want a Caesar salad, I want the real deal, dressing and all. And he says :ok I'll be right back with the dressing.\" Nooooo. This isn't even the right lettuce, there's no parmesan and there's tomatoes in this salad. But he was long gone before I could say anything. When he came back I told him again that i want the correct salad. He gave me lip and said with attitide, \"I thought i asked you that. I'll go get you a new salad.\" You did, and you failed  to listen to a what I asked.  Also, the food is very cheap quality with a high price tag.  Management really needs to educate their employees on what customer service truly is."}
{"text":"What a joke.  Complete waste of money. Horrible management. Would not return. Complained to GM and he literally said not my problem and turned around and walked off.  Way to treat your guest"}
{"text":"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL....   If you like people who talk the WHOLE movie and staff that walks around the whole time on their iPhones taking orders, then you've arrived at your favorite movie theatre...  This was the worst experience ever. They messed up OUR seat reservations and then asked OUR party of 6 to move. The issue was with one of the staff members, Bianca, who gave very false information about our seats. (It created a HUGE issue.) Then the manager proceeded to inform us that we needed to move because another group had reserved the seats we ALREADY reserved. But he made it clear his staff member Bianca would be getting in big trouble for the mistake.. Who cares?? I want the seats I paid for. Not some big scene with outside people getting involved and making matters worse. The manager came back and gave free movie passes to our group... No thanks. That won't be necessary. I will never ever go back to this place.   So again, if you like to enjoy a movie out where it's quiet and peaceful then DONT GO HERE!! You will regret it the second you go up the escalator to get inside."}
{"text":"While in theory this theater offers an exceptional movie going experience, the execution is not present. The options of food and drink service to your seat may seem enticing, however the service is slow and the servers are incredibly distracting. Avoid this theater if you do not plan to order food. Too many servers scurrying around the theater, often chatting during the movie, seem to make little effort to be subtle or quiet. The food delivery is slow and our party experienced problems with our order which took an even longer time to correct. Furthermore, an issue with the parking validation became an expensive hassle. Assigned seating is one of the few perks, however given the rest of the experience I would be willing to forego assigned seats for a less distracting and more enjoyable movie going event."}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is one of those places that is reliable, but not extraordinary. The food is okay. The seats are office chairs, which is a little weird, but comfortable enough. What's great about this theater is the ability to reserve tickets online and choosing your own seats, no wait time, and a small fee. The servers are never obstructive, and are quick with orders and usually polite. (If you get a Groupon for this place, snatch it. Best deals for a movie.)"}
{"text":"If you are big on customer service, this is not the place for you.  This place was very very very unprofessional and lacked any good sense of how to provide quality customer service along with lacking how to deal with unhappy customers.  On March 17, 2017, I went to the SMG at the Epicenter to inquire about the movie, Beauty and the Beast, after hearing that there were some controversy over the movie through social media from some parents that had seen the movie stating that they were very upset with Disney and disappointed with the movie because there were reports of homosexually scenes in the movie they felt were a bit too much for a Disney movie.  After learning about the controversy, I wasn't sure if the movie was appropriate enough to bring my kids, ages 8 & 7 to see, because of course I haven't seen the movie.  Instead of taking a chance and just seeing the movie with my kids, being the responsible parent that I am, I thought that I would inquire about the movie first with someone that worked at the movie theater thinking that they may have some insight on what to expect from the movie due to all of the hype in order to make a sound decision.    When I walked into the establishment, I saw two employees, a male & a female standing behind the counter.  The female was helping a customer to the left of me leaving the male employee open for business as he stood there looking outside of the doors doing nothing.  When I walked up to him, I greeted him by saying hello without a response back, and asked about the movie.  I expressed my concern about what was said on social media in reference to the movie, and politely asked if the movie was appropriate for a 7 & 8 year old due to my concern.  With a stoic look on his face, he responded to me saying, \"It's a PG movie\".  Not feeling satisfied with his answer or that my question was being answered, I asked the question again, but in another way providing more detail of why I was concerned about movie informing him of reports of possible inappropriate scenes of homosexuality in the movie that was inappropriate.    Sometimes, people can misinterpret or get it wrong about what is being said or seen, and I needed that confirmation.  His response was the same repeating that the movie was a PG movie, however, this time, he said it with attitude, and responded by saying, \"So what\", when I informed him about my concern over the homosexuality scenes.  Feeling the tension, I shifted to the female employee who was done with helping the customer she was helping when I first walked in, and she asked me what was the question that I had asked the male employee that needed answering to see if she could help.  I repeated to her what I had asked the male employee, and she replied saying, \"Oh, he is gay, and was probably offended\".  I responded to her stating that I didn't care about his sexual orientation, and told her that what I was asking was a question that any responsible and reasonable parent would inquire about when it's concerning their kids regardless of whatever issue was being reported.    I was a concerned parent with a reasonable question that deserved a reasonable answer without being treated less than or feeling that they were making me feel like a bigot for having a concern or for asking a question.  Clearly these two individuals didn't have any kids, and couldn't understand where I was coming from, but let's continue there's more.  The female ended up answering my question stating that they leave decisions whether to see a movie or not up to the parent, however, the movie is a PG (Parental Guidance) movie, and that they haven't seen the movie in order to comment.  I then asked the female a rhetorical question asking how come her co-worker couldn't just state the same thing she just stated without giving me attitude, and being unprofessional by being rude with his comments because he was into his feelings.  There wasn't any management on staff at the time to complain to; therefore, on that following Monday, I met with management of that SMG location after being redirected by the Corp Headquarters for the SMG in Dallas, Texas back to the management in Charlotte after attempting to file a complaint.    The manager was less than helpful, and at first appeared to be concerned, but gave me the typical response that is given to an unhappy customer that would make a person feel like nothing was going be done stating, \"I'm sorry that happened to you, and I going to look into it\".  I asked for a follow up, and was told that they don't do follow ups, that I have to trust that they will take care of the issue, leaving me in limbo of whether something was actually going to be done.  I attempted to call the Corp Office again, but of course I got voicemail to their HR (Human Resources) Department after asking for the proper procedure for filing a complaint, and I was told that all complaints are made through their HR.  Still to this day, I haven't received a phone call."}
{"text":"Needs better office chairs.   I don't get the office chair thing. I suppose next time I know better and will pick a row with real seats. They aren't even nice office chairs. I might bump up a star if they get some Aerons.   The concept is good and its cheaper than ipic, and around the level of an Ultrastar ( but that has better seats).   Our service was slow on drinks, but decent on the food.   We will probably go back, but be careful to pick a real theater seat if you go. Not our top choice, but acceptable."}
{"text":"I recently attended Studio Movie Grill for the first time... I will not be returning to this theater again and I am surprised they are still in business. I bought a groupon over a year ago and forgot that I had purchased them. I read on the groupon that the amount I spent on the tickets would still be validated through Studio Movie Grill, however, the actual groupon purchased for 2 tickets and 2 drinks for 10.00 would not be validated. My understanding was that I would have 10.00 to spend at the theater. When I logged onto my groupon for the day to print the tickets I noticed they had the same promotion going on for the 2 tickets and 2 small drinks. I figured I would call the theater to see if they may honor what I purchased through groupon since they were currently offering the same \"newer\" promotion. I called the theater several times and they do NOT have anyone answering phones. I tried all of the automated numbers and not a single human answered the phone. They offer to call you back but I took my break at work to call and cannot receive calls at work seeing as I work in a hospital with patients and I am constantly on my feet. So my coworker and I decided to see the Purge on Tuesday night at 520pm. We grabbed a nice happy hour at the Four Peaks nearby and went over to the theater at 5:10pm. Upon arrival to the front \"purchase\" desk, I asked the girl if they would consider honoring my expired groupon since they were doing the same promotion presently. She looked confused mummbled something, said I dont know and than began to charge us the full price for the movies. I decided that 4.00 was not a huge issue and she clearly did not know how to ask someone for the answer considering she had no anwer herself. As my friend and I went to find the theater for our movie we noticed that she charged us for Iron man 3 which had started 15 minutes prior to our purchase, and it was the wrong movie. So not only was she incompetent in finding out an answer, she was not competent in our purhcase of the correct movie. We returned to the front desk with the manager seeking the correct movie. I noticed there were two young blonde employees at this point. The newest employee was being asked the question of what are matinee times by a young couple arriving to the movie theater. Her response consisted of looking at the manager several times... the manager helping my friend and I, and then stating...\"they are in the afternoon.\" I could not believe that an employee was not knowledgeable on what times a mantinee consisted of. So my friend and I went to sit down in the theater now having the purchase of the correct movie. The seats were moderately comfortable and I felt as though I was in a conference center preparing for a powerpoint presentation. The staff was loud during the entire movie taking orders from the other patrons which was distracting. The menu we received to order from stated that Tuesdays were ladies nights and ladies could receive 5.00 movies all day and night long. We had paid 7.00 per ticket and not offered the ladies night price. At the end of the movie my friend and I exited the theater at which point I noticed a different manager from who had helped us previously. I went up to him and asked him why we were not honored the ladies night price and he said that we could not be honored that with a groupon. I said that my groupon had expired and it stated that it was a 10.00 gift certificate to the theater...so why not just offer the guests the 5.00 price? He said no and I said well thank you, over four dollars I will not be returning to your theater and I plan on writing a review. His response consisted of an \"ok.\" As many times as I've seen groupon offering deals to this theater it is CLEAR they need more patrons and are not making enough money. Maybe they need to consider a change in employees, consider training employees on competencies and managers on satisfying patrons over FOUR DOLLARS. Had my friend and I received the slightest amount of good customer service and compassion we would probably return to the theater but due to the lack of customer service and employee knowledge you couldn't pay me to return to this theater. I would highly recomment amc cinema suites for they have a more knowledgeable and helpful staff and way more comfortable seating. I do not see Studio Movie Grill maintaining their business much longer and that projection is also based on how often they have to offer groupon prices to just get patrons to come see a movie."}
{"text":"This is very likely our last visit. For the second time in a row, our food order was messed up and delayed.   We had to ask for our popcorn twice...and it came after the meal instead of before. Our drinks went to the wrong place. The food was marginal at best.   It's a great idea ... they just haven't quite figured out how to pull it off."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and finally decided to write a review.  As a movie theater, I think it deserves 4 stars. The seats are super comfy, especially if you're on a date. The screen is pretty big, and just the whole concept is pretty neat.  As far as the food...   It's okay food - reasonable, especially for a movie theater. Theres quite a few options to choose from which is nice. They also have daily specials during the week.  The drinks.... EVERYTIME I have ordered a mixed drink there, it's pretty weaksauce. So most of the time I just stick with beer cause I know exactly what I'm getting.  One time I got a margartia pitcher...total waste of money. was soooo weak and 60% Ice.  NOW THE SERVICE Is why I have to give this place a worse score than what I want to. Everytime I have been here, the service is terrible. I understand it's hard to service a movie theater, but that's not the problem. Theres been multiple times where I order food and something that I order never shows up. One time I ordered a beer...waited 45 minutes and finally pressed my service button to tell them I hadn't gotten it...he apologized and got me one...but then when I got my check they charged me for two. Yes, I wouldve had two if my first one didn't take an hour to get."}
{"text":"I decided to give SMG a second chance after a zero star first experience where we ended up walking out because the speakers in the theater didn't work... Todays experience elevated them to two stars because we actually got to watch AND hear the movie.  The service and food were NOT good. We ordered a \"duo dip\" with queso and hot spinach dip.  When it arrived, the dips were spinach and guacamole - not what we ordered.  I informed out server and waited approx 20 minutes.  While we were waiting, we tasted the chips and spinach dip.  Yuk!. Chips were beyond stale and spinach dip was cold, watery and tasteless. When our queso dip never did arrive, I took the uneaten  (and uneatable) chips and dip out of the theater to our server in the lobby  and explained the situation, asking him if we could please just have some popcorn with butter and salt.  Popcorn eventually came, with no butter or salt.  obviously just poured out of a bag somewhere as it was nowhere close to fresh. By now, we were well into the movie and  I had missed the first part.  Oh, and when the bill came, we were charged for the chips and dip we never ate, as well as a \"side\" of queso that not only was supposed to be part of the original order, but never was delivered at all!  On a good note, the bartender in the lobby was excellent - but certainly not worth another trip.  In this case, two strikes ant they're out."}
{"text":"I read a lot of bad reviews about SMG in Charlotte NC and was hesitant to go. But I decided to ask friends that lives in the area their opinion and they told me that they always had a good time when they went there. So my husband and I went yesterday and we had a great time! The movie was good, food and service was great and the theater was clean. If I had to complain about something it was that the seats that I reserved online were labeled wrong so it took us a couple minutes to find our seats. I would definitely go back and I would definitely recommend this theater to anyone."}
{"text":"We had a great time! Food and beverages were GREAT! Make sure to get your parking ticket validated though!"}
{"text":"Went and saw Avengers 2 with my girlfriend this past Friday night. Had a couple of drinks prior to going into the movie, waited to order food until we were in our seats.  The entire experience was great. From picking up the tickets to being offered a mint on our way out. The drinks were well made and served by very friendly staff members, the food was also prepared perfectly and served as expected.  We got our food and drinks quickly without interruption. The theater was the perfect size and even with a packed room we did not feel crowded or annoyed by loud people. Everyone was having fun and seemed to respect the relaxed atmosphere of those around them.  The only complaint I have is the quality of the seating. It could be a little bit better. The cushions were a little worn (not as comfy as some other places). But other than that, the experience was exactly what we were hoping for.   Best of all, the price was perfect. We paid full price for the tickets and didn't take advantage of any specials on food or drink but we did not feel like we were overpaying.  We will be returning, for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for a movie!! Food was good and pricing was fair and can't go wrong with the service. First time there and will go back again and again and again."}
{"text":"Been here twice good wine, okay menu, no gluten free (hint).  We tried to do the 2 for $25 special they were running but we told we could only pick from a few appetizers and entrees so we just split a burger??  Other than that it is nice to have a decent theater close to home."}
{"text":"I hope more people give SMG good reviews. We had a great time, and I printed more passes so other family members could enjoy this place. We saw Arthur Christmas, a terrific movie, and the food was better than I expected. Top-notch restaurant quality at average prices. Good sized portions. I guess we were lucky and had the 'good seats' with the swing out trays. So I have no complaints about the chairs. The wait staff was friendly and did their best to duck out of my line of vision. I had a great time, altho I must say the kids movie did not require a lot of concentration, so the staff walking back & forth were not a problem for us. It was a bit distracting, so I give it 4 stars for that. If you don't value the experience of eating while watching a movie, then don't go here!"}
{"text":"I had the worst movie experience in my life at this place. It wasn't a busy night and yet everything was going in slow motion. My family just wanted popcorn and sodas. And they said the carbonation machine was out. So we ordered pink lemonade. About 30 min into the movie, everyone's orders had come out except us. Finally I ring the button again and the girl comes out and says they don't have pink lemonade either. So I ask for popcorn. It's now an hour in and still nothing. Finally she comes back with a bill for our original order and asks if we'd still like it. I look at her like she's crazy. The only consolation was that they didn't make us try to pay for stuff we didn't get. Since when is it hard to get popcorn and a coke at a movie theater. It's not rocket science. Will never be going to this place again and you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"I have had the opportunity to experience great dining/movie watching at other facilities...  With that said, I found Studio Movie Grill to have a confusing layout, unprofessional staff (friendly, but having phones out texting and talking with each other versus greeting guests) and DIRTY.  The menu was fine, typical fried foods, overall tasteless... but it was nearly impossible to eat at the awkward trays.    Service was alright.. they took our order and delivered... we had our check about halfway through the movie (they collected everyone's at once though... I did have concern that something would get mixed up, but it didn't). If I ever went again, I would just bring cash so that I didn't have to worry about my card. (This was all very distracting from the movie.)  Overall, if you're using a groupon - it's fine. Otherwise, just watch a movie the old fashioned way and go to dinner after."}
{"text":"I have been to Studio Movie Grill many times with family and friends and every time was an over all great experience. We always go at busy times (Fri. and Sat. 7-9pm)  Yes, one or two annoying or minor things may happen but that can and does happen where ever you may go. We had a worse time at the Costco two miles down the road that we have ever had here.  Food and booze are served to you while you watch a movie = AWESOME Groupon deal for $5 a seat = AWESOME  Updated online reservations using the Groupon deal are now available. Paying the $1.50 extra per ticket to purchase on-line is worth the price for busy nights. You avoid standing in line early to buy seats (they do sell out quickly on Fri. & Sat.) You can buy about a week in advance and reserve the best seats. You can print your tickets at a self serve ticket printer in the lobby and avoid lines again. You can roll up to the movie at the last minute and never worry about finding good seats since you already picked them out.  The food is slightly overpriced*, but the portions are large and all the food we tried was good. Besides, they have to make $ somewhere when they keep putting up $5 movie deals on Groupon. I even drive from Warner/101 all the way to Scottsdale and it's cheaper than Harkins for 4 people. *You are not required to buy the food.  For the ranch lovers out there, they have the good stuff like Red Robin. :)  The fries are yummy, thick and crispy. Most items served with fries are in a square bowl so  the bottom fries get soggy under your other food but I don't mind and they still taste good    The food servers in the theater are polite and very fast to respond to your call light when you need something.  The food comes out quickly and they don't dawdle with the check but are still polite and don't bring it while you are in the middle of eating.  The front lobby area is clean, open and spacious with plenty of seating at and away from the bar.  The bathrooms were clean and well stocked except for once on a very busy Sat. night.  The non counter seats are nice and have the little personal swivel tables. The seats rock a little and are the leather type material, cup holders in the arms.  The counter seats are just black leather office chairs, they are not the best, but still fine for watching a movie. If they upgraded those chairs then I'm sure they would get better reviews but they would still have to roll so you can get in and out from the counter easily.  I went once with a friend of mine whose son is in a wheel chair and those seats were great since we just moved the office chair and rolled the wheel chair right up to the counter.   Just try it and don't go expecting it to be the Ritz and you will have a great time."}
{"text":"Went here because of a groupon. I think I can safely say that you wont have too many rowdy teens/college students. Thats a BIG PLUS. Some reviews talking about a long table with desk chairs and would have rather had reclining chairs. Agreed.... but its easier to eat at a table. and you can definitely choose where to sit. so you dont need to sit at the table. Food is not pricey... similar to regular movie theatres. I would go more often if it was closer.  But.. the set up is similar to ipic... food and drinks while you watch a movie. dine in while you watch.. i think it falls short of ipic... but i think its also cheaper.."}
{"text":"My sister & I came here on 6/18/15. The movie (what we saw of it at least) was great. The service on the other hand... unbelievable, & not in a good way. I ordered a blackened chicken salad w/coconut chicken, no onions, dressing on the side. Not real complicated, & I've ordered it probably 8 other times here w/no issue. My sister, who has a gluten allergy, ordered a gluten free pizza. We also asked for a side of fries. Our food came out about 20 minutes later with a few problems... We could tell the pizza wasn't gluten free, which we were glad we caught as she is 38 weeks pregnant & spared her a reaction. The coconut chicken on my salad was cold, which I could've lived with, but they had also drenched the salad in dressing & added tomatoes (which weren't listed on the menu or I would've had omitted). The fries & pizza were also cold so we hit the button & sent everything back (we for some reason had a new server (#2), & she told us that they always serve the chicken cold on their salads... Cold deep fried chicken? Interesting...). Our original server had entered everything as we had ordered & repeated it back to us so I'm not sure what the problem was. Having now missed part of the movie, we patiently re-awaited our dinner's arrival. Well, 2 out of 3 ain't bad! The fries & pizza were hot & gluten free, but can't a girl get a salad? The chicken was hot, but the salad was once again drenched in dressing & topped w/tomatoes & onions this time (& not the kind that you can just pick off or I would've). I again pushed my button (no pun intended) & yet another server (#3) came out. I asked him to write down my order, which he did, & he was very friendly & apologetic. However, 2 minutes later, server number 2 returns & informs me that the kitchen manager will not remake my salad but that I'm welcome to choose something else from their menu. She explains that they're really busy & he doesn't have time for it. What?! Is this real life? You do realize I'm not 3 years old right? Did I miss the fine print that says that the staff reserves the right to decide what I have for dinner? I couldn't believe my ears. I kindly told her that I chose that salad because I wanted that salad, & that I still want that salad, & that if the kitchen manager would like to talk to me about the matter I'm more than happy to. She left, rolling her eyes, & finally... 15 minutes later, as my sister is finishing her dinner, mine arrives. Third time's a charm! It was perfect (minus the frozen lettuce, but at this point I would've devoured a tomato-stuffed onion soaked in ranch dressing) & we tried to salvage the second half of the movie. When server #2 came in with everyone's checks, my sister & I wondered if both of our meals would be comp'ed for the mistakes or just my salad (although her gluten reaction would've been worse than any bad salad). Well, both wrong! Nothing was comp'ed! She had worked in restaurants for 10 years & was mind-blown, but we thought surely this would be resolved after a brief chat with the manager post-movie.  As we exit the movie, we see someone who appears to be a manager, & says he is a manager, but we still aren't really sure (Eric maybe?). We explain the whole ordeal, & his response is that the 1st server never should've allowed me to order coconut chicken on that salad. Again... is this real life? Not \"sorry that we almost poisoned your pregnant sister\"? I told him that I order that exact salad every time & have never had a problem, & that even tonight the chicken wasn't the biggest problem! The problem was a simple math mistake... adding instead of subtracting ingredients. This isn't Calculus people. He then says that to make up for it, he will give me a couple of free movie tickets (as if I may be returning... great sense of humor on this guy!). I said no thank you, I'd like the salad comp'ed at a minimum... he replies \"ok, but please don't order that salad again\" (ok dad!) then rolls his eyes & storms off w/my check. After another wasted 5-10 minutes, he calls another manager over (I assume maybe the GM? Didn't catch his name), & yet another 5 minutes later comes back & says \"here, we took off the pizza & the salad\" & walks away. We check the bill, & apparently our sweet potato fries were $17. We do a brief scan for the Candid Camera crew but to no avail, so as GM guy walks by my sister asks him what exactly we were being charged for. He tells us they comp'ed 2 of the salads & 1 of the pizzas. We very patiently tell him that we only ordered ONE pizza & ONE salad to begin with & that the other 5 items on our bill (lol) were all kitchen mistakes. He (FINALLY) took the bill & said he would comp the entire thing (he was actually very nice & apologetic, & he didn't instruct me on what to order next time so that was a plus). We thanked him, then left & went to breakfast (insert sarcasm).  Studio Movie Grill is great if you're just looking to watch a movie... but eat beforehand. The \"Grill\" part needs work!"}
{"text":"Not too impressed by this place. The seats were verrrrrry hard and did not recline and the service was sub par."}
{"text":"SMG use to be great, not so anymore, far from it in fact.    - They've replaced the large and comfortable cloth seats with smaller faux leather versions which only serve to make you hot. - I was with 4 other people recently; one guy never received his food, and one of the couples with us never received their water. - There is a bar/club downstairs and while the music has never been an issue in the past, now it's utterly horrible. Loud bass bleeds through the walls and will disrupt the entire theater if you're there for a night time viewing. - You pick your seats ahead of time when ordering online, this has always been a boon in the past since I usually go with multiple other people, we can ensure we all sit together. The problem? Well, the floor plan/chart used online to pick your seats rarely (if ever) matches up with the actual theater layout... The problem here is most evident when you sit on the back row, since a wall may or may not divide your group in half... Contrary to picking seats next to each other online. - The waiters and waitresses seem to have no idea where the correctly numbered seats are anymore, this may have something to do with the new seat redesigned mentioned above, but it's pretty annoying to get interrupted/asked multiple times throughout the movie if \"you're in seat 13?\"... NO! IM IN SEAT 11! SHOULD YOU NOT ALREADY KNOW THIS???  There are a few more things I could mention here, but you get the idea."}
{"text":"This place was just too weird for my taste. When I go to a theater I go for the movie not for all the circus of it.   I liked the decor. The staff and manager were super nice and friendly. But they were way over staffed. I'm sure in a few months time they will realize the overhead costs vs the revenue.   I think the owner tried too hard. When you first walk in it feels like a hotel lobby/airport. They announce the movie times like when you board an airplane. They should have had staff dress like pilots and stewardess lol   The food is minimum $10 and about $12 for a salad. It felt like \"restaurant\" prices without the restaurant taste. I ordered a piña colada and it was served in a martini glass.   When they finally called our movie time. We were told how great the seating was. When I saw I wasn't impressed. In fact I was disappointed. I work at a desk 40hrs a week. The last thing I wanna do is feel like I'm sitting at a desk on a Saturday night. We opted for the VIP type seating instead of the \"desk\" style seating.  The chairs at the VIP seating were too hard. It was uncomfortable. After two hours my butt was numb.   Then the service! I like that they tried to make it easier by serving you at your seat during the movie but when you have a theater full, it gets distracting. You have a light behind and in front of you so you can see the menu the entire time of the movie. Then you have wait staff passing in front of you a minimum of 15x throughout the movie. It was distracting!!!   We didn't watch a movie for kids, but the minute I walked in the theater I knew that any movie that played with kids involved would be a circus. Especially with the executive chairs that roll and the tray table they would play with that throughout the movie. Not a good idea.   I went to enjoy the movie and I noticed on the car ride home we talked about the theater and not once about the movie.   I give this place a max of 3 years before they close it's doors. As for me I prefer AMC or Harkins."}
{"text":"Fun date night for me and my husband when a Groupon is available. Otherwise, this can turn into a pricey date. But their dishes are simple yet good and the atmosphere is very swanky and fun."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  Always a good deal and great seats...and drinks and food served while you watch!"}
{"text":"I've stopped seeing movies anywhere else. Great seating, great screens, great sound, great food and drinks and the cutest male wait staff I've ever seen!"}
{"text":"I am another former employee writing this review anonymously to not be targeted by Studio Movie Grill. I would love to start with the pros of the place, but unfortunately, there are none. By far the WORST work experience (and customer experience, yes I've gone as a customer as not to be biased) I've EVER had. I don't even know where to begin with the pathetic, joke of an establishment this is.  I guess I'll begin with the self-absorbed, careless teenage scum they hire. From Day 1, my \"trainer\" didn't know jack themselves, and they're supposed to be training me? Every single employee gave me the unfriendly \"newbie\" vibe, as pleasant as I was with them. None of the trainers cut me ANY slack, and only treated me in a condescending way. Not to mention the rumors I overheard of other employees coming to work stoned and spitting in unfriendly customers' food. Also, employees sneak kitchen food when the managers aren't watching. I want to emphasize that the women are especially catty and clique-ish. They're obviously only working there because they need the money. When I went as a customer, big surprise; they were still not friendly and the server was rude.  Also, employees are mentally abused (really stupid concept; serving food in a loud, dark theater) and consistently yelled at through the whole work period. Cursing and rude comments are slinged around the kitchen like no tomorrow. Employees are given NO breaks (there's not even a break room) and it overall feels very hostile. I agree with the other former employee's review that this place breaks MANY labor laws.  The management was pretty fair to me and they do try to make customers happy, but they are very disorganized. After quitting my job, I didn't get my final paycheck for MONTHS after I quit. Professional.  The food is greasy and is sure to give you a stomach ache, especially since no gloves are worn by kitchen staff and sanitation is practically non-existent there. That's right, the chefs touch raw meat, then touch everything else in the kitchen like toppings and drinks. I also saw a COCKROACH in the kitchen. After being alarmed by it, my trainer said, \"oh yeah, those hang out around here sometimes\", like it was no big deal. The Health Department needs to be called and this business needs to be reported to the Better Business Bureau. This place needs new kitchen management and general staff (maybe not immature teenagers?)  Also, it was my (and other employees') responsibility to keep restrooms clean! I was a food server, so before serving your meal, I unclogged toilets without wearing gloves (since they weren't made available)! That's right; very sanitary!  I highly recommend you read this review on SMG from another former employee as I agree with all of it 100%. http://www.yelp.com/biz/studio-movie-grill-scottsdale?hrid=Q223yBY-S1CCor0YWAUx4Q  Anyways, thank you for reading my honest review about what a terrible, \"premiere\", snobby excuse-of-a-movie-theater SMG is. Stick to Harkins."}
{"text":"Took my 8 yr old son here the other day for the Childrens Summer Series. We saw Puss in Boots. The tickets were cheap as the concept is similiar to Harkins Summer Movie Fun. The food was actually pretty good and reasonably priced. My son really enjoyed his experience and said, \"mom when new movies come out can we come here to see them?\"  I would like to come back for an adult movie/drinks. As a fellow yelper previously reviewed, you end up not being able to see your food and they do not pick up dishes. However, there are arm rest cup holders which provide additional tray space!"}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times over the last couple of years. Each time I have been disappointed with the service. There are always issues with the food orders. Probably won't come back. Much prefer the Cinemark Bristro on Monroe Rd."}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this place. In fact, after a less than pleasing first experience I went again in hopes that my experience was just an outlier. Sadly, turns out it was not.   The seats are really comfortable. Both times, my husband and I sat in the A/B seats and neither of us had complaints. The food however is a completely different story. The idea is a good one and I have had great experiences at smaller scale dine in theaters but this company really has a long ways to go until you can call their food acceptable.   The first time, I had the fish tacos and my husband ordered pepperoni pizza. My fish tacos were terribly bland. The fish was dry and there was just no flavor at all. Halfway through my meal, I look over and see that my husband (who LOVES pepperoni pizza and can eat an entire large Little Caesars pizza no problem) has barely eaten a slice. I ask about it and he says in no less words that its the worst pizza he has ever had. I try a bite and the whole thing tastes like plastic! I think they must cook them in the microwave.   The second time was even worse. My husband decided to go with the chicken strips because \"nobody can mess up microwavable chicken strips\". He had no comment on them so I assume they weren't horrible but weren't great either. I had the burger, also assuming that they wouldn't mess up a simple burger but apparently they could. Half of my burger tasted so fishy that I can only assume they marinated the meat in sardine juice or something. No idea how that can happen. Several of my fries also tasted very moldy, which of course I couldn't confirm because you're eating in the dark. In addition, we made the terrible decision of seeing Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs the second time and although it clearly states on the screen to take your children out of the movie if they are being disruptive, nobody takes that seriously (including the staff). We were sitting in a row with about 5 young children who were all shouting and throwing temper tantrums and their infant sibling was crying hysterically the entire time.   I really did want to like this place. I just can't. I don't see myself going back there in the near (or distant!) future but if I did I would go to a PG-13 or R rated movie where hopefully there aren't screaming babies and I would not order food. They do have Angry Orchard Cider on draft so that is a bonus!   They get two stars from me because the first movie experience was good but zero stars for the food."}
{"text":"I have to say how disappointed I am these days with the customer service. ..or the lack of customer service I experience.  Today I experienced great customer service from a manager named Mike. He went out of his way to not only help me out of a bad situation,  but his actions help turn the situation into something great. I really appreciate him calling me back and the help he gave my family.  Hopefully some of his professionalism and caring will rub off on the young snotty kids in today's workforce."}
{"text":"I can't believe the mediocre ratings of this place.  We've been 4 times now, and the service is impeccable.  I can't believe how fast and organized they are.  Prior to this we went to IPIC several times, and why it's very nice and trendy, the service has always been horrible and it's way overpriced. In fact the last time I went to IPIC, my food was not served until the end of the movie.  This is my new place to see every movie.  The food is good, the drinks are reasonably priced and the service is amazing.  They have a team work system.  Our server took our order and entered it in an iphone type of system.  She still was taking other orders, and our food was delivered to us in less than 5 minutes!  I hope this place succeeds."}
{"text":"I've been going to SMG off and on for a few years. It's a great concept. The food is pretty good. I've found everyone to be friendly. I do have complaints with the execution of the service in the theater however. There seem to be two main issues:  The main issue I have is the general disregard for peoples' movie experience. I went to see Justice League tonight(totally doesn't deserve the bad press it's been getting. Go see it and give it a chance. Will it change your life? No, but it'll entertain you). The servers were making unnecessary noise during the movie, talking to each other and socializing as they were delivering food, which distracted me multiple times. Then the servers were going around and picking up plates and glasses, obstructing my view to get to other tables, during the climax of the movie, which was frustrating. I understand that it's customary in normal restaurants to keep the tables clear, but Studio Movie Grill is supposed to be an improved Theater experience. Leave the glasses and plates alone until after the credits start rolling or until the customer places an order for another drink/food item.   The second issue I have is that there doesn't seem to be a proper procedure for delivering the food to people. We sit in numbered seats(i.e.  G6 or whatever), yet the food delivery people never know where to deliver the food to. I was in Thor: Ragnarok last week and my movie experience was interrupted 5 times with someone else's food. (seriously, I'm not exaggerating...it was 5 times that a server asked me if I ordered X and I was like, \"no\"). When someone orders food, the food intake person needs to write down the seat number in the order so that the food delivery person won't interrupt the movie for people unnecessarily. I loved  Thor by the way.   All in all, I feel like these issues can be fixed with some additional training. If these problems get fixed , SMG will be a great theater option worthy of five stars."}
{"text":"I still really like the Studio Movie Grill, but sat in the \"General Admission\" seats last night for the first time, and found that they were not nearly as comfortable as the \"Reserved\" seats with their own little tables.  Unfortunately.  The GA seats are also quite tightly shoved together, so if it is a full house you are bumping up against your neighbor, and it is distracting.  Best bet:  Go to a un-crowded movie and sit in one of the reserved seats that is not pre-reserved (not pre-sold, and doesn't have the little \"reserved\" sign on it) to enjoy the reserved seats at the GA price."}
{"text":"Usually we love it here but tonight we are very disappointed. We ordered pizza and popcorn before the movie even started, we asked twice if it was coming out and we were told that they were very busy. I can understand that but how hard is it to make popcorn? We finally got the pizza with about thirty minutes left of the movie. We never received the popcorn, yet it was still on our bill and we had to ask to have it removed. Overall we were really disappointed and will probably think twice before heading here again."}
{"text":"So if you are looking for something indoors to do during the summer (which I know you are), then this is good for something a little different.   The food is good enough (even with gluten-free options!) and there is a wide variety. I like the sweet potato fries.   I thought I wouldn't be able to enjoy the movie because I am super picky about noises and distractions, but it wasn't a problem at all. Honestly the food is overpriced and I wouldn't go without a groupon deal on the tickets (which they have available like every month), but the overall experience was fun and definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Why anyone goes to regular movie theatres, I don't know. After going to a place with comfortable seats, food and alcohol, I just can't go back. I love the healthy food being available--but ordered the korean tacos and their pizzas are worth trying. The drinks are good- cocktails are just the right amount of strong and their beer has never been stale. Tuesday night special (at least I think its Tuesday) is All You Can Eat pizza, couple that with a pitcher of beer and a good movie and it's a great weekday night."}
{"text":"Way to ruin the whole movie going experience I don't go to the movies to get drunk or eat a whole meal but apparently some do. So you take an already obnoxious person give them a few beers and wow a really obnoxious person. Not only do you have to deal with people talking now you have servers coming and going during the movie making all kinds of noise. To top off the whole experience their  Popcorn sucked."}
{"text":"I love coming here! What's not to love about a place where you don't have to wait in long lines for new movies in the heat and rush ahead of everyone else to get great seats!?!? Aannnnnnnnd they bring you food and drinks while watching a movie?!  For the same price as regular theatre. Oh yea! Thumbs up from this gal.   They how have daily $2 kid movies. Awesome deal and great way to get out of the heat!   Tips:  Reserve or choose your seats online in advance for popular movies and later time frames. Please make sure you don't choose in front of screen. Hehe I learned the hard way but the manager is a sweetie and helped me out -without making me feel like a ding dong.   Plan on having wine or a cocktail or two ;) they have them. And they bring them to you. Regular prices. Woot woot  Food is pretty good. I love: popcorn (used to be to so great-it's better now) chicken nachos, any burger or chicken sandwich is great. Their cheese fries are addictive!  I'm not a fan of the desserts yet. I've tried a few and not feeling it. But they have a brownie sundae people like. Something about the sauce on it isn't my thang.   If you go earlier than 5pm time frame it's golden. Not too crazy busy-like most movie places. Still-I reserve online. The seats that say C are the counter seats and you may not like them. Go first and sit in regular then decide. I don't care for them and always choose back row.   Hit your red button as soon as you sit down especially if you are hungry. Someone comes right over to take your order.   Depending on what time you get there it might be dark so look at menu online. The 2 for $25 deal is a winner for me. Two entrees and an appetizer or dessert I think.  We get it every time."}
{"text":"The people did as well as they could. But the system is bad. Even being the first to arrive, it took over30 minutes to receive a glass of the house wine, and 20 Minutes to receive the next one. The lack of written communication means that you have to TALK during the movie to place an order. And then when the check comes, the server insists on interacting with you to give you the check. \"It's your BILL!\" she groused. Just be discreet and drop it off and pick it up. We're watching a movie. Sheesh. Other venues have this all figured out."}
{"text":"I went to the Studio Movie Grill loved the seating concept I ordered the hamburger and sweet potatoes fries WOW it was good.  Do go online to their web site to check for movie times because I went onto movietickets.com site and it wasn't updated the movie we wanted to see wasn't until later in the day we did pick another movie and it was good.  I will definitely go back wish we had one over in Arrowhead."}
{"text":"Had a groupon for this place so we went here to see an evening movie. I have never been to a place like this before--a theater that serves you restaurant food right to your seat!! My friend and I shared the coconut breaded chicken tenders (came with fries) and they were delicious! I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of food as well. With our coupons, we also got free drinks (non-alcoholic)! Will be going back in the future."}
{"text":"My first experience 1/15/14 I was impressed with dining and movie concept. I was disappointed in their Wed. night all you can eat pizza 'special'  Once me and my boyfriend ordered it, we were then told, we had to order a six slice pizza each and could not share - then it was all you can eat!  It defeats the purpose of the all you can  eat pizza advertised. if you're spending over $10 each to have to buy a pizza before the all you can eat kicks in, where is the benefit?  Misleading."}
{"text":"Very good service here! Even if your a different race than your server. Excellent model that twc arena concession people should emulate! Great movies & prices. Will go again even though parking sucks."}
{"text":"We went using a groupon deal so we didn't order any food. The theater wasn't crowded, but all the waiters were a little distracting."}
{"text":"Worst theatre ever. No wonder they are willing to only charge $5 for a ticket. I don't know if we got a \"bad theatre\" but my fiancé and I sat in OFFICE CHAIRS, yes non reclining, wheeling, no arm rest OFFICE CHAIRS! Oh and our \"tables\" or shall I say \"linoleum office cabinets\". What the heck?!? Oh and get this! The lights to illuminate your food aren't really blue, THEY ARE WHITE WITH BLUE PAINTERS TAPE OVER THEM! Most ghetto theatre I have ever been sat in. I'll never go back and hope I get a good theatre."}
{"text":"LOVE this concept; wish the service was more consistent. First time was pretty smooth - our server was organized and professional. The last few times however, food has been forgotten, cold, and closing out my check proved to be a nightmare as our server was MIA and didn't bring the check (or even ask if we wanted it).   We had to wait for 20 min after the movie ended in a line of people who apparently had the same issue but with different servers. No apology for this whatsoever.  Another time, they clearly forgot to run our food (literally our whole row ordered at the same time; their food arrived in reasonable fashion, while ours took 3/4 of the movie? It wasn't even meat based which requires extra cook time! When it did come it was very, very cold -I'm not usually picky about temp but this just couldn't be ignored-so we didn't even eat the fries. No apology for this either.    Again, great concept, and a few visits went well, but the inconsistency and frustration of such needless distraction should make prospective customers wary. I still wanna go back to eat while I watch a movie but it's a gamble with the service!!! Hopefully this changes."}
{"text":"We will never return. Today's interaction with the on duty manager solidified such unexpected poor customer service.  We are loyal customers that have been patrons since opening day. we had an issue with how they are handling groupons (so many changes over the year). They are over charging customers that I'm sure many are not aware. Done research w/ groupon who says they are suppose to be honoring the groupon per terms of the agreement but movie grill seems to be revising their terms illigetly not in writing & w no notification. You are hit with fees at the ticket counters that total beyond the ticket rate when you include the amount paid for the groupon.  Bait & switch tactic .Who's going to leave after packing up the family w kids excited to be forced to pay these unknown fees.This could lead to class action. Anyways the manager Kenny could have cared less & went on his way. what a shame & this could have been handled more professionally but now they lost some very loyal customers. shame shame !"}
{"text":"We normally do our \"dinner and a movie\" night at the iPic in Scottsdale. We had a hard time getting tickets at iPic for Star Wars, so we gave SMG a try. They had plenty of tickets on hand and great seats, so we bought tickets from them anticipating a fun night out.  The movie was fantastic, and the quality of the theater was good. The reason for the two-star rating was the food, drinks, and service. SMG does not have, but desperately needs an organized system for getting customers their food and drinks. There were plenty of employees attending the showing, but they seemed to be flying around the place in utter chaos. As a result, I got the wrong drink. My husband's drink -- a Mountain Dew -- didn't come until 30 minutes into the movie. Well after we'd finished our food. We had to signal the employees twice to get them to bring it over.  They were very apologetic and brought me a free drink (the correct one, thank goodness.) This could have been avoided if they coordinated their service.  I ordered the coconut chicken strips with shrimp, which came with fries. None of this was freshly made. The fries tasted like they were made hours ago and reheated.   If we come to SMG again (and we might, ticket prices are good and the staff was friendly even if uncoordinated) we will eat before or after the movie."}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for movies.  We typically find the $5 GroupOn deal and it is way cheaper than the regular movie theater and less crowds.  If there is a movie we really want to see, my hubby reserves our seats online - can't use GroupOn.  We have always gotten there early so that we are not stuck with the office chairs.  We typically get the reclining seats.  We love that we can order drinks and food and they serve to us.  No more of the balancing act with drinks and popcorn at the regular theater.  The food is decent - they offer appetizers, salads, burgers, chicken strips, etc.  They do make an effort in having a healthier menu by offering fresh fruit, salad, cheese and fruit plates.  Sometimes they are very heavy handed with the butter - they butter the buns for hotdogs and burgers...just tell your server light or no butter.  They also serve alcohol.  Their food and drink prices are definitely lower than iPic, but are comparable to YardHouse pricing.  The service is great and a great place for a date night."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the service was decent,  would definitely recommend to others"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would.  It's like this theater tries hard to be awful.  Front desk was unattended so we waited around for someone to appear... no apology.  Went to the bar and the bartender made no eye contact, greeting or any signal that she saw us. She was talking to another employee. We could hear their conversation (they were not trying to have a private conversation...)...both were trashing the business and fellow employees.  Someone approached the bar and asked about the food...they told the customer that it was terrible to not order...she thanked them for saving her and walked away.  I called out again to our bartender and she approached - no greeting... looked at us... I asked about the food...said I heard what she told the other customer. She said that it was fine, but they were out of a lot of things.  We ordered wine and waited for our movie.  Once in the theater service was slow. The waiter said they were short handed and repeated that they were out of most everything on the menu.  We found an item that they still had, waited and saw it delivered to the couple in front of us.  Talked to the manager who essentially just shrugged and said again that they were short handed.   Does anyone from this business read these reviews or care?"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The ticket prices are reasonable, and it has stadium seating with nice chairs. I prefer to not sit at the counter seating, but it works if that's all that's available. The food is decent, but a little expensive. The wine list stinks, but I suppose that's to be expected. All and all a nice spot."}
{"text":"The service was pretty good, but the food took a while. I can be understanding about that though, because our theatre was pretty full, and if the kitchen is cooking for 15 theatres, it's going to take a while. Unfortunately, my burger and fries were lukewarm/cold, as was the popcorn :( So I didn't finish either... The seats were super comfortable and the venue was very interesting and fun- as others mentioned, I would go here for the movie (maybe a dessert/drinks), but not food. It wouldn't be a cheap night either way."}
{"text":"We went again last night...we sat in the back row. The seats are really, really, uncomfortable. They seem to have updated the hosting seating process...so we arrived 6:45 for a 7:50 show to be sure we had good seats...luckily I am used to fly SWA and I was able to barge my way through the cattle call to be one of the first people into the theater so we could pick what I thought would be decent seats...but wait...we screwed up...we choose the back row, upper right where the isle was. The spot we choose was dirty and not clean...we had to call someone to clean it. After she finished cleaning it, we had to press the button again to order our bottle of wine. And wait...the spot we choose...HUGE MISTAKE...all the servers ducked when they were in front of you, but not when walking down the stairs...so obviously whoever designed that row was smoking a doobie and thinking about his food service over the entertainment/movie part of this entire experience...because clearly these seats suck because there were always people walking in front of you. Oh and did I mention the seats were so uncomfortable I thought I was going to have to go to the Jacuzzi afterwards to get all the kinks out of my back?  Ok...the good...I was able to drink a bottle of wine during a movie!"}
{"text":"Completely disappointed.  Entrance, lobby, bar, and theater were all disgustingly dirty.  One bartender for a bar full of movie patrons.  Floors sticky, light fixtures dirty, seats and armrests and trays all sticky and dirty with food and grease.  Didn't get to enter the theater until 10 minutes after the movie was scheduled to begin.  Still waiting for the trailers to begin 20 minutes after the movie was scheduled to begin.  Amazed this place is in business."}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is becoming a regular spot for us on a Friday and/or Saturday night. I would hardly consider going to a \"regular\" movie theater again. Even if you don't plan on eating a meal, the appetizers are pretty good and the service is great. The seats are so much more comfortable than typical theaters and the cost is about the same. Why not when you can reserve your seat in advance?!"}
{"text":"Poor service! Poor service! Poor service! Management came over to try to make a mends just to receive poor service again. Only bright spot bartender in lounge which She tried to make the best of her co-bartender horrid service"}
{"text":"This was just an overall bad experience.  First part of order (sliders) came out ice cold.  Then after sending them back they did not bring out the rest of my order.  Them they attempted to Bill me for food that I did not receive.  Everyone here needs to get retrained in customer service.  If I could give this place no stars I would.  Absolutely the worst experience at an establishment of this type ever."}
{"text":"The movie theater itself, the service as well as the drinks are very satisfactory.   However, my Co-workers and I were extremely disappointed by the food.  We did not expect it to be the quality of a high end restaurant,  but would have liked it to be at least edible.   We shared the chips and dip, coconut chicken nuggets and the potato skins as an appetizer. The spinach dip was the best thing out of all the food we had that night. The coconut nuggets were extremely dry, the potato skins did not have much flavor and the guacamole tasted like packaged guacamole (we are in AZ afterall!)   I had the Mahi Mahi and chips as an entrée.  I was well aware that I was about to eat a fried dish but wasn't prepared for the amount of grease oozing out of the fish. I tried to peel the batter off but I already felt sick from the first bite, so it didn't help. The sweet potato fries might have been good if they weren't cold.  I shared a cheese cake which was okay and a milk shake which tasted very artifical.  My coworker had Mac and cheese that was beyond dry, as was the chicken.    Our expectations weren't high, yet the disappoint was. Especially since the food menu online displays \"farm-to-table\" type of good food. I would still go back for a movie and drinks but I'd definitely eat beforehand."}
{"text":"We live about 30-40 minutes away from SMG but it has become our number one place to go for date night by far! Given, you do have to get there early or purchase reserved seats online in order to get the good seats, but how many other theaters even give you the option of reserving your own seats without paying a ridiculous amount of money? For about a dollar more than regular price you can sit wherever you choose to and get there a little later and not wait in line.  As for us, we love getting there about 30 to 45 minutes early so we can order food and drinks and enjoy the meal before the movie begins. Doing so allows us to eat at our own pace and with the lights on, and then nibble and snack on whatever we didn't finish throughout the film!   On that note the food is delicious. Every time we go, we try something new and haven't been disappointed with any item on the menu. The best part for me at least is that I tend to drink soft drinks quite a bit during movies, so having a refill on demand by pushing a button is a revelation! Don't forget to indulge in the popcorn as well, since it is popped from a very high quality, large popping kernel and served with a side of real melted butter (not butter flavored topping), so you can douse it in butter or leave it off if you want a healthier option.  The staff from top to bottom was exemplary and attentive. I had originally thought the wait staff would be extremely distracting, but they are discrete and do their best to be as invisible as possible as they bring everything from popcorn and drinks to full meals at any time you want before or even during the film.   Great execution and the food is no more expensive than a typical bill from Chili's, however the quality of the food is head and shoulders above your typical bar and grill fare.   A smart tip for those complaining about waiting in a long line: they have a line dedicated to people who pre-purchase tickets. That includes people who purchased through Groupon as well as SMGs online site. With the \"On-Call\" line we have never waited more than 5 minutes and usually use our Groupon, which they run regularly and is five dollars which includes any movie and a non-alcoholic drink. $5 for a movie, drink and a speed pass through the line? Who complains about that?"}
{"text":"I bought reserved tickets to Studio Movie Grill, and I am very happy with my experience. Here's how it works: You buy tickets either online reserved or open seating -or- go to the place and buy tickets. If you bought tickets online, you get to go to skip the ticket line and go straight to will call. You wait for your movie / time to be called and you line up to be seated. If you bought on-line reserved seats then you get to skip the line and be seated first. Once inside the theater, you look at the menu and then press a little red button on your table top when you are ready to order or need service. Watch the movie, pay for the food, go home.  I found the food to be pretty good. The price was reasonable.The service was very fast, and I didn't notice any waitstaff blocking the screen to go back and forth.  My suggestions to you are: Buy reserved seats online. You get to skip all the lines and not chance getting stuck in bad seats. Do not buy tickets for the very first row because those are rolling office chairs as despised by previous reviewers. The other seats are nice reclining type comfy chairs where the middle arm goes up in case you want to snuggle with your movie going partner. Bring cash if you plan to buy dinner. When they brought the check, they brought everyone's at the same time in little trays, then they picked them all up at the same time and brought them back at the same time. I was worried that they would mix up all the cards with the seats (it didn't happen, but I would bring cash next time).   I would go again and would recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"We recently went to see Sing. The screen kept going black, while the sound played (happened 3 or 4 times). The manager MORE than made up for it by providing every guest with two free passes. What amazing customer service! I understand things happen, so it is nice to see an establishment that steps up to make the experience better.  Prior to the above incident, never had any problems with the movies. Been here multiple times. Food is good, not too pricey, drinks are a little expensive, but decent. I like the reserved seating. It's never been so crowded that it feels uncomfortable. Great lobby area."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It is different than large scale theaters.  Due to them serving food, there aren't as many seats in the place.  It can get annoying having servers coming around while the movie is going and they need to figure out something with lighting.  You cannot see what you are eating in the dark!!!  I like that they will do soda refills.  Try it out!!"}
{"text":"As a concept, I think they stumbled upon a great idea. Too bad there seems to be some cutting of corners.   I attended an afternoon show and the food was terrible. It was obvious that this was food prepared hours before, if not actually left over food from the day before: the fries were so dry you could be forgiven for thinking they were chopsticks, the spicy wings were rubbery, and the sauce they poured on top to make them seem fresh only made things worse. My wife's sandwich was soggy, so much so that she couldn't eat  after a few bites as there was nothing to hold, especially since they hadn't supplied a spoon to scoop the gruel with!   Because I like the idea, I might try a later show to see if they serve fresh food then, but I have to say that my first experience was disappointing."}
{"text":"This place can't stay in business much longer! Honestly - what were they thinking putting THE MOST uncomfortable seats possible in their theaters. The fixed seats DON'T recline and are quite tiny (along with the attached food trays). The rolling chairs (which we sat in) are straight out of a cheap conference room and DON'T really recline much either. They roll up to a cafeteria style counter. In this day and age of uber-comfy recliner seats and posh amenities, this place falls extremely short. My neck hurt after the two and a half hour movie and I couldn't get comfortable to save my life. I will NEVER patronize this establishment again - unless they put some comfortable seating in.  Additionally, the \"digital\" 3D was extremely dark and the 3D glasses were riddled with scratches. It was truly one of the worst movie going experiences I've had in recent years.   The only reason I gave this place two stars (instead of 1) is because I thought the young staff was very professional and did their best. The food was average."}
{"text":"I took my son and his friends here for his birthday! Big mistake. We ordered food that was mediocre and the service was horrible. We asked on numerous occasions for refills and never got them. I even suggested to the server that I can go and refill them myself and she reassured that they would be brought out."}
{"text":"came here with a groupon. I really like this place ,what you would pay for a movie and dinner you can do here all in one. food is priced good. the dessert and alcohol was a little crazy. we order a Molten Chocolate Cake w/Vanilla ice cream it was 7$ was so not worth it it came on a reg sized plate and a lil cup for the ice cream the cake itself was no bigger than the palm of my hand(i have tiny lady hands lol). i still would come here again but learned my lesson on the desserts.Its a fun date night. i also would like to add that yes they do not clear off you dishes so if no one is seating next to you(which we got lucky) then you can just put you stuff on the next seat but if not than those dishes might be with you the whole movie."}
{"text":"I tried this theater with much hesitancy, after reading reviews.  Normally, we go to AMC Esplanade and LOVE it.  However, we are much closer to this place.  I disagree with the poor reviews - perhaps the management read them and got it together!  We had excellent seating, excellent service and the food was as right as I expected it to be for this type of place.  The staff is overwhelmingly polite, courteous, and fast.  We will definitely be coming here often now!"}
{"text":"I could hear the adjacent movie running at the same time.  The cheap college auditorium desk did not help and the desk lamps that glared in your face as you tried to watch a movie was a little annoying.  I might go back if I get another $6 groupon, but never full price."}
{"text":"No more traditional movie going or me! This place is really cool. If you have limited date time (like you are paying a babysitter) have dinner and a movie all at once.  I had the coconut chicken strips and fries and they were good. Don't order the cheese and cracker plate it's gross but DO order the popcorn. Oh and being able to press a button and have someone bring you alcohol during a movie? Hello!"}
{"text":"Does every movie currently have explosions?  Trying to watch The Post and at times impossible to hear based on what is happening in the theater next door.   5 stars for food and service...1 star for sound proofing."}
{"text":"OMG!! This is the best theater in the state!!! We drive literally and hour to go to this movie theater!! The managers are amazing!! Thomas and Jason!! Talk about great managers with great personalities!!! They always make sure everything is going well! And the waiters make it feel like a family instead of a movie theater/ restaurant. If you want the best waiters ask for Phillip or Brendan!!!! They truly care that you get your order correct!!! And they are just some amazing guys!!! If you want a great movie and dining experience check this one out!!!! You won't regret it!! PROMISE!!!!"}
{"text":"I attribute my great experience to the bartenders, especially this young man named Eric. He had a great sense of humor and was able to anticipate my needs even though he was obliviously busy!  I came in last Saturday night and waited at the bar before my movie: you get to pick your seats so I wasn't worried about finding one and skipped the previews while having a drink! Love this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The \"southwest airlines\" style entry is a bit annoying and when we got in there were \"reserved\" signs on all the reclining chairs so we sat in chairs that are like office desk swivel chairs....hardly comfortable. Harkins is much more comfortable! O'well tried it once....have been to iPic which has it all over SMG!  IPic was awesome!"}
{"text":"What a great deal!!  This place is comfortable, great price, good food, clean and has awesome audio-video.  I love the healthy food being available--but ordered the korean tacos and their pizzas are worth trying. The drinks are good- cocktails are just the right amount of strong and their beer has never been stale.  I wish they had one in Gilbert/Chandler area, so I could go all the time."}
{"text":"The husband and try to snag Groupons to come here whenever we can. My first experience here was actually at a Yelp event (yay Magic Mike!) and I was so impressed I said we'd have to make it a point to come back on a regular basis.  The concept is a fairly new one that's been gaining popularity. It's a movie theater/restaurant. You get into your movie and you can order food from a pretty decent menu. There's a good list of drinks as well. It's not going to beat many of the great restaurants around, but it's better than say... Applebee's. You can get pizza, burgers, salads. There's a kids menu too. It's decent food. Better than Applebee's, not quite a Yard House, if you want comparisons. I've had the thin crust pizzas and burgers and both were solid, good eating. I've had their drinks too- the Skinny Tea deserves a mention, it's quite delicious.  The movie theaters are clean, and the screen and sound systems are competitive. The service is very prompt. The seating arrangement does take some getting used to- sometimes you have to sit at these odd library cubby style things, but it really doesn't' take too much getting used to. The waiters ducking in and out with the food isn't as intrusive as you think either. Summoning them is done airplane style- press a button and somebody is there pretty quickly.   And if you arrive way too early for your show (like we did once) hanging out at the bar makes it as pleasant as something like that can be. It can get packed, but then everybody floods into the theaters and then the lobby gets empty again. They will not, btw, let you into the theater in advance of half an hour before the show. I think they cycle their theaters through pretty extensively, and that time is to make sure the staff can get in and clean everything out.   If you snag a groupon a ticket and a soda is only $6. Steal! Otherwise I believe it's $10 a ticket. Still also very reasonable. Definitely worth popping by for date night."}
{"text":"The movie theatre is nice because you can reserve your seats so you don't have to worry about where you are sitting. I have been here now 4 times and I keep coming back solely because of the above comment. However, the service of food when sitting in the movie is awful. I have not received food twice when all others around have. I have had the wrong orders multiple times. They advertise on the menu for spiked cherry limeade but every time I order they are always \"out\" of the black cherry vodka. The last excuse was the distributor, which I find odd seeing how other places can get it easily. I think it is poor on the ordering side of the place.   Given the multiple times of bad service every time I have come, the manager is quick to help solve the problem by apologizing, refunding and/or giving replacement movie tickets. The staff is always friendly, but they need to get their act together!"}
{"text":"Very comfortable with great hospitality.  The prices were definitely fair to enjoy a 24oz beer with the movie - only $7.50.  My girlfriend ordered a piña colada and it tasted terrible but was immediately given a new drink free of charge when she informed the waiter.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience, and will not be returning again. My two guests and I came to this theater for the first time tonight, and none of us had an enjoyable experience. Before the previews started, we placed our food and beverage orders with Jourdan. After being told that they were out of our first drink choices, it took over fifteen minutes to actually get our beverages. Thirty minutes into the movie, my meal and my friend's appetizer arrived. At this time, I requested condiments and a refill from the food runner. Twenty minutes after that, I still had not received anything I had asked for, nor had my friends received their meals. I managed to stop Jourdan on his way past and questioned where our other meals were, to which he responded with \"what food?\" I then had to re-order our missing dinners, as well as my drink and condiment. Over an hour into the movie, our missing dinners finally arrived, however they were barely warm. By this point, my food was ice cold as well (granted this was my own fault, as I had foolishly decided to wait to eat with my friends, not knowing how long it was going to take). Eventually another server dropped off our bill, just before the movie ended. I still never got anything I asked for, additionally, I had been double charged for our meals. After leaving the theater, I requested to speak to a manager to deal with these issues, and was informed to wait in line (he already had two groups in front of me, complaining). After waiting 15 minutes, a female employee came over and informed me that my food was comped. That in itself earned them their 1 star. However, the employee then began to make excuses and tell me how I could have avoided the whole situation by \"asking to speak to a manager as soon as your food took a long time\" and \"get a manager when you got your bill\". That is NOT how you handle an unhappy guest! I was there to watch the movie and enjoy the food I paid for, not to miss it by talking to a manager in the middle of it. The employee didn't seem to understand this concept, however, and just repeated that she took the food off my bill, and next time, to talk to a manager as soon as a situation arrives. There will definitely not be a next time. We will not be returning to this theater again. Your servers and runners need to be better trained in their jobs, and your management needs to be more professional and taught how to treat and take care of their guests!"}
{"text":"Okay, so this is a hard one to write since I have experienced the creme de la creme of movie going experiences, which was iPic, at the Scottsdale Quarter, a mere few miles away from Studio Movie Grill. But, alas, Groupon came a knocking and we bought a few cheap tickets and decided to go last night. So, here we go. If I had NEVER been to iPic, i probably would have thought this place was the bees knees, with its sports bar atmosphere, and semi-decent seats, but since I have been spoiled, it is oh-so-hard to compare. iPic does it right. The chairs, the blankets, the swanky menu, the layout of the seats, (where servers aren't darting past you during the movie), and the fact that they serve you all of your food, all at once, no interruptions during the movie.   Studio Movie Grill has sort of an airport experience. You get your ticket, then you line up for your movie, then they like cattle call you when you can \"enter\". We know when we can enter a movie, thanks. We have all been to a movie in the last century. All you have to do is put the little \"Theater is being cleaned\" sign out. We get it.  There is a bar outside, which is a nice feature, so you can get liquored up before you get herded like cattle. Yet, they don't give you much direction. Since I had been to iPic, I understood the whole \"servers inside the theater\" concept, but I am sure many patrons don't, so I urge them to communicate better, as in, \"once you are seated a server will greet you and take your order\". I think having the bar outside may make people think that they have to only order outside the theater.  Now, the movie theater itself. Yikes, My fiance hit the nail on the head. If you went to a large university like we did, and was subject to lecture hall classes, or \"clicker\" classes, this is exactly what it felt like. The chairs were office chairs. Yes, black, pleather, uncomfortable, swivel office chairs. I kid you not. And they had red buttons for \"service\" on them. The buttons didn't bother me too much, the staff was fairly attentive. I wasn't a fan of the layout. iPic is laid out so that your servers never walk in front of you, disrupting your movie. These poor people have to run and duck every 30 seconds. Talk about back aches!   Food- I had an iced tea, my mom had a margarita which I have to say was a heavy pour, which was nice. We got the sliders and they weren't bad, and the fries were delicious. The menu looked like high end sports bar, so pretty much everyone could find something on the menu to enjoy.   Overall, the experience was so-so. If I want to eat and see a movie, I might as well go big or go home and go to iPic.  I figure you can do one of two things: 1. Have a regular movie going experience and go to like a plain old Harkins, or 2. Have an amazing experience, blow some extra dough, do it up style, and see a movie at iPic. Don't settle for second best."}
{"text":"Great prices and specials food isn't great and restrooms are always disgusting (and I've mentioned to several managers but each time we go they are nasty."}
{"text":"We finally went here last night to see a movie. We usually go to the RoadHouse by the Talking Stick. And I'm sad to say it only gets two stars because it was AWFUL compared to them. First. Their food was terrible and dry. I requested no musmrooms and grilled onions on my burger and I got ALL these slimey mushrooms and NO grilled onions. Our pop corn tasted old. And our fries were cold. Now second. We picked our seats online and thought aw cool they have the amazing recliner seats too, because they were advertised online as \"recliner\". Well no. They were sticky crappy seats. And our only other options were...computer chairs...yes...they have rows of COMPUTER DESK CHAIRS for you to sit in. So you know. You can feel like you're at work. Thirdly our theatre was packed and we sat on the corner of the isle...lucky me had to hear the servers SET THEIR TRAYS down right by my head the whole time!!! Literally right next to me. Because all their end seats are a little table the servers use. It was just the worst movie experiences I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and go to the ROADHOUSE if you want a movie/dinner night."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the first time going to SMG and I was impressed with the food, ordering, and movie and sound.  I see about four movies a month so I'll be back.  It's loud on the lobby but not inside.  The seat back could be higher but not a problem."}
{"text":"The sound for the movie was amazing and a groupon made the movie price worth it. The service was just ok. We got food that wasn't ours and at one point I ordered a refill and it took ten minutes and then they brought me 3! There is something broken in their line of communication for sure. The quality of food was terrible. The hamburger bun was hard and chicken was rubbery. The popcorn was stale, although we never ordered it someone literally ran by and dropped it off before we could ask why this other item was being dropped off. The portions were small especially for the quality and the price. I don't think we will return. A good old fashion night out with dinner at a separate restaurant and then a movie is the route we will take in the future."}
{"text":"I got a little too excited when I found the Groupon and bought way too many. Anyways, the procedure is you pick you seats when you buy your tickets. There are leather recliners type chairs which are super comfy, then there are counters with rolly chairs.   We ordered the appetizer sampler. It was around $15, but it SOUNDED like you got a lot of food with it so we got it. This is what we got 2 chicken tenders, 2 quesadillas, a small handful of parmesan fries, and 2 coconut chicken tenders. Umm... in my world that small amount of food should not cost that much. Also, call me crazy but shouldn't parmesan fries come with parmesan on them?  Round 2 of Groupon-mania we ordered the quesadilla meal. Still a rip off :( I don't think those poor quesadillas had any flavor at all! The chips and salsa that came with it are good though. I would suggest just getting your free soda and not getting any overpriced, bland food."}
{"text":"I have attended many event at this theater , great place to rent out for small events like a birthday party. The food is good, for a movie theater and I love the fact that you can order food while you are watching the movie! I suggest you get there early and order because the food can take sometime! I love the brownie dessert! look out on Groupon for special movie deals."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 entrees, 3 popcorns, 3 drinks, 1 side of ranch, plus 1 shake and the shake was supposed to come out later.   Entrees came out with no drinks, no ranch, and no popcorn but did come out with the shake (which was too early)  Server didn't seem concerned or very interested with looking into missing items (but they weren't the same server that took the order)  15 minutes passed no drinks (which makes it hard to eat and food was getting cold)  I walked out of movie to speak w someone...  5 min later drinks came- still missing popcorn   5 min later popcorn came...(this is approx 1/2 way through the movie even though order was placed 10-15 min before movie started)  5 min after that more popcorn came that wasn't ours or that was double ordered...  When I was done w meal ranch came.   At one time I heard people behind me say \"that's not ours\" to something else.   All in all I would say 4 different people brought stuff to us instead of our original waitor.   Very disorganized and choppy.  I think I got some things taken off the bill but i still don't get how after I spoke with management the drinks and food and ranch STILL were so choppy.   This was supposed to be a fun new experience for my dad on Father's Day and I traveled from Winston Salem to do it. He liked it but it could have been much more enjoyable with better service.   I think the team needs to perform retraining and evaluate measurements of success for sustaining better customer service and overal customer experience.   On a positive note the staff that helps you check in at the lobby for movie tickets went above and beyond to explain the kiosk and were super sweet."}
{"text":"Great movie experience for the family. Love the idea of having a glass of wine served during the movie and being able to order a popcorn refill for the kids instead of having to leave the theater and miss part of the movie."}
{"text":"We bought Groupons over a month ago that  expire on March 21st. This past weekend was the last weekend we could use them, so we either had to go, or forfeit the discounted price. Unfortunately the movie I wanted to see wasn't there, but we were able to get tickets on opening night to 21 Jump Street (which was hilarious! - 5 stars for the movie).   To be honest, I wasn't really looking forward to going because I had read bad reviews (standing in a line outside the theater? Office chairs? Servers running around during the movie?) Well, all of it is true. You walk in, buy your tickets, and then are sent to wait in line. 15 minutes before the movie started, we were let into the theater. Immediately, we saw the dreaded rolling office chairs. Lucky for us, though, there were two of the \"reserved seats\" that hadn't been reserved. I asked one of the employees if we could sit there and he said yes. We sat in the first row of reserved seats which essentially is the first row of the top section, right behind the main walkway. If I would have paid extra for these tickets, I would have been pretty upset, because the servers run (crouched down, which makes it more distracting) across it during the movie. I felt pretty bad for the servers - that cannot be good for your back!   Anyway, after we sat down, we pressed the red service button and someone came by to take our orders. I order a Diet Dr Pepper and my husband had a Sierra Mist (Pepsi products). Probably about two minutes later, the drinks arrived. I was pleasantly surprised how quick the service was, but unfortunately my drink was wrong. No big deal, I just pressed the button again and someone quickly changed it out. It was wrong again. Ok...third time's a charm, right? Nope! After two root beers and a Diet Pepsi, I finally walked out of the theater to find a counter where I could at least see the right one being dispensed! There was a manager standing right when I walked out and he let me know that he'd bring me Diet Dr Pepper, and he did. It's really not that big of a deal, but I think they need a better system of labeling sodas. They said they use different straws, but maybe no one knows the straw system? I don't know!   We didn't order food, but I did glance over the menu. Popcorn is $4.25 and they had a pretty wide selection of items.  Overall, I'm just not really a fan of the eating dinner/watching a movie thing, but everyone is different.   Unless there was another Groupon (and even then, it'd be questionable) I don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"Have you ever watched a 2-hour movie from an office chair...? (perhaps) Have you ever said to yourself, \"Gee, I wish movie theaters had office chairs INSTEAD of comfy movie chairs for my 2-hour long viewing pleasure?\" (prob not).   That was really the only hitch. Waitstaff was super friendly and attentive to food/drink requests. But really? Hard office chairs?? My butt lost feeling about halfway in, and we were crammed in alongside other movie-goers so I couldn't rotate at all to stretch out like I do for the other 8 hours/day I'm at work.   Perhaps the experience would have been much better had we selected seats not in the office chair rows...? Who knows. With a Groupon, I justified the experience :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place at the epicenter.  Went here to watch Gravity in 3D. Now let me just say they are up to date with the finest technology especially for 3d. The seating was comfortable. You can reserves  your two a seat even online. Now what makes this place more special than others? The fact that you can order food and they bring it to you quickly. I so would've ordered more but I already ate at the restaurant right next to it. But there menu is large, but mainly filling up with drinks. I ordered the frozen hot chocolate and that was delicccccoous! I want it again so badly. The one bad thing is that of course everything in the movie theaters are 300% overpriced. But nonetheless I had an exceptional time! I came in for my birthday and I was greatly pleased with the customer service, the movie, and the food!!"}
{"text":"I live right by SMG, so its very convenient. But there are two major issues I have with the place.   1. The food needs to get better. I have tried 5 different items and none of them were good. Its usually over done and extremely greasy.   2. The seats are not good. I would rather sit in a regular movie theater seat that actually reclines, than the bulky uncomfortable seats at SMG."}
{"text":"FYI - to anyone who has appreciated having a nice movie theater uptown, strike it off your list of accomplishments.  SMG has really made some terrible terrible changes.      The new aisles SHOULD be a nice improvement, as they pretty much prevent the need to cross in front of anyone in their seat, but they selected LED lights on them that brightly shine directly at your eyes during the whole movie. That problem is intensified by the fact that THEY DON'T CLEAN the 3D glasses between uses.  Mez used the type in plastic bags that were processed and cleaned for next use, but now you just set them on a table and they rely on a minimum wager to 'clean' them, which they don't do well.  So I had grease smudges on the glasses that pretty much made the lighting glare worse.   It was a huge relief that they kept the old seating, as that was a major plus for the Mez theater.  However, to fit with SMG's [terrible] business model of having 'waiters' IN the theater, they added a swivel table with a call button on top of the old small surface on the armrest.  These effectively block the drink holders, which caused at least one person in my movie to drop and smash her glass (must have been alcohol, as they now serve regular drinks in plasticware).  They also cause the eating surface to be very high and uncomfortable.  I'm 6'1 and my friend is 6'3 and we both noticed the discomfort of the table height so I'm sure average people will dislike it too.  I actually found it a worse experience to eat WITH the tables than simply with the seats how they were at Mez with my plate on my lap or on the arm rest tray.     Then comes the business model that SMG is pushing, which I have comparatively realized is completely horrible compared to Mez.  You have 'waiters' coming up to take your order IN the theater.   That means unlike before where you made your menu selections and orders outside in the lobby with a buzzer to pick it up, you now must look through the menu in the dark and then attempt to order the meal to fairly unprofessional and unskilled waiters, who then enter it into a smartphone app.  Of course it is nice to have the food runners bringing your food to your seat, but that could have been easily added to a process of deciding and ordering at the bar like before and giving them your seat number.   There were lots of SHHHHH's during the moving because of the process, not to mention it being more likely to have people walking around the theater.    It also took uncomfortably long for them to even come when you press the button, so it isn't likely that the process saves you time.   It is an extremely inconvenient convenience.   Lastly, the food is absolutely goddam terrible.   I will never plan to eat there again.  So they have put up tons of tacky infrastructure and employment relating to forcing food on you, but then the food products are basically poor tasting fast food.  The french fries had a strange smell.  The burger had no taste.  Yet, they are charging MORE than Mez charged for good quality chef-quality food.  It's bad enough to look through a menu of frozen-fried junk food, but it's hard to mess up that level of foodstuff, and these clowns sure found a way.  $13 burgers just do not taste like hockey pucks in the real world.   I was so put off by the experience, that I may seriously just pretend there is no movie theater downtown.   For the most part, I am the type of person who understands growing pains for new businesses.  Certainly they might shape up the employees a bit, which is a glaring need.  But while they didn't change much, the changes they made cause the dinner-and-movie experience to be much worse than before.   Their whole business model is completely terrible, in my opinion.  Terrible food at high prices selected in the dark and ordered with whispers eaten uncomfortably on a poorly retrofitted tray and dealing have low end employees hovering around the theater the whole time.     I had very low expectations when I went, and it was far worse.   Maybe someone who hadn't been to Mez, and doesn't care about 'having nice things' will totally be fine with this, I don't know.  But for the same or higher prices, it is hard to imagine tolerating such a steep decline in quality and experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I can honestly say I'd rather see a movie here than any regular theater.  I like the big puffy seats with the table that folds down in front of you though the other office style chairs they have aren't bad either.   The servers are barely a distraction which is great because that was my biggest concern.  It's nice that you can get a variety of food, the salads are pretty good, chips and salsa, hummus, quesadilla - good stuff to pick on.    Reserving seats and being able to get your tickets without having to deal with anyone is the best.  Being served a cold beer while you watch a movie is also pretty nice.  They keep it clean too, I've had to wait while they clean the theater out between shows but the waiting area is comfortable and they have a bar in the lobby.  I took my iced tea glass from the bar into the theater and continued with my refills.  The parking lot isn't the greatest, it's long and narrow so getting an end spot or spot where no one will park next to you is tough.  Eating in the dark is weird."}
{"text":"We had an amazing evening! First we used coupons from Groupon. We got the movie and a drink for $5 each. Get there early to guarantee a good seat. They lined us up about 20 minutes before the movie. Loved the seats! Sit in the larger comfy chairs with the swing around table.(Easier to get in and out of for bathroom breaks..) My family enjoyed ordering food from the menus instead of waiting in long lines at Harkins.  Servers were prompt and respectful not to interfere with the movie. Food was awesome! Love the coconut chicken strips and sweet potatoe fries! Can't wait to go back....."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a groupon to this place, so we tried it out to see Prometheus (great movie). The moment we stepped inside, we knew it was a very a high class place, which really isn't our taste, but it IS Scottsdale...  My main beef with this place was the OUTRAGEOUS A/C! I get cold in theaters, but I was SO cold in this one that I could not move to get up when the movie was over. Even my husband was cold, and that's saying a lot.  We weren't crazy about the fact that waiters are constantly coming in and out of the movie as well. It's very distracting. It makes it difficult to focus on the movie, especially when the cowboys behind us are yelling \"giddyup\" at every scene, and talking very loudly to these waiters. All in all, we don't agree that serving food/drinks during a movie is a good idea. We avoid the movie theaters because of ADULTS who cannot seem to shut up as it is, so this wasn't the best experience.  FIX YOUR A/C! It doesn't need to be so cold in that place. Not sure we'll ever come back."}
{"text":"Lobby bar has very slow service. We sat there for almost 20 minutes before being waited on. Many other customers were getting irritated as well for the same reason. I love the movie and dinner idea, but again drink service during the movie was very slow. You get immediate attention when pushing the service button, but we waited forever for the drinks to actually get to us. The food was pretty good, but prices a bit high. I have to mention that the employees that took the tickets at the entrance were rude and immature. They just grabbed the tickets and started talking to one another...no personal customer service at all. Summary: great business idea, but hire some mature workers and make sure you have enough employees on hand to take care of your customers."}
{"text":"The WORST service. Literally everyone around us had a problem with their food. Our waiter took our order and it took over an hour to get a Dr Pepper. After the first 30 min, I put my light back on with waiters walking by over and over again and nobody stopping to see what I needed. Our waiter never came back once. I had to ask someone else to grab my drink and by that time, the movie was 15-20 min from being over."}
{"text":"Great concept but poorly executed. The service has been bad on three separate visits. Seems the waiters take your order and payment but never return with your food.   Make sure you eat before you come to see a movie"}
{"text":"I went here on a Monday night and watched Tombstone with my boyfriend. The seats were okay not so comfortable. We ordered a dessert which was very good and ordered a burger and fries which was alright. I just didn't like the uncomfortable seats."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just too spoiled after Road House Cinema's. This place is SO poorly run, Saturday afternoon we ended up in this tiny theater. It wasn't clean, the seats in comparison were bad. You can have a seat or office chair, neither would be my choice. We were way too close to the people next to us! I ordered popcorn and a drink. OMG that is the worst popcorn ever, over salted and what the heck is that fake butter. Seriously so GROSS!   My friend had even worse food than my popcorn. With the choices of Harkin's & Road house I won't be back. They have good food, great seats and are clean."}
{"text":"This is a great place to see a new, highly-anticipated movie as you can pick your seats online, negating the need to stand in line for an hour or more in order to get good seats or sit together as a group. The chairs at the counter seats are starting to show their age, having small rips and tears on the armrests. The food is decent, but nothing particularly special, and it's a little on the expensive side, though that is typical of movie theaters. You can often find discounted tickets on Groupon, so be sure to check there first. Overall, it's not a bad experience, but also nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Horrible service and management. Came by and used two groupons on a weekday and was advised that we can only use it towards the ticket cost. What's the point in getting a Groupon if u still pay regular price. Management was unprofessional and staff was very rude and have no customer skills at all. Place has always been going down hill and rarely ever gets full. Wonder why?"}
{"text":"For the price I love this place. Get the Groupon deal and it is the best. We like to come here to watch a movie, have a few drinks, and grab a bite to eat. If you have an issue they have no hesitation recognizing it and compensating for it."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place now for about 6 months (since it opened) I have now been here 10+ times and this is my second review. I love Studio Movie Grill, I only go to this theater now, it is great everytime.  I would like if they updated their menu, although I do have some favorites I would like some new options."}
{"text":"We went to SMG last night to watch Gravity 3D. I really love this location and the concept of a movie theater and bar/grill combined together. The inside is very nice and welcoming. The prices aren't really that bad (plus, we had a Groupon!).   We both ordered a beer (it was $3 for domestic draft.....which for some reason is only Bud Light and Coors Light. Amp up your domestics!) and split the pepperoni pizza. The pizza came out waaaaaaaay before the beers did. After like 25 min or so we finally got our beers. The beer and pizza were both good. No complaints.   I guess my biggest struggle with this place is that they could just do some little changes and go from a \"just ok\" place to an \"amazing\" place. For example: -Have a better ordering/distribution system. I have zero clue why a cooked pizza would take longer to bring out than a draft beer.  -All the waiters and waitresses keep walking by you throughout the whole entire movie.....once the movie starts, lessening the people that walk around would be nice. -Bringing out the checks closer to the end of the movie. They bring out your checks like right at the climax of the movie....which is like 45 min-hour before it is even over. I mean I bet there are a ton of people who would have ordered another drink, if they would have just waited to bring out the bills towards to end. It was super distracting.  -A can of paint to the ladies bathroom walls. In the end, I am not a person who cares about this, but figured it was worth noting for the ladies that did care. The bathrooms doors are all scribbled with \"LT loves ES\" and \"Christy Rocks\" (ok so maybe not those exact names but you get the point). Just a can of paint would make this \"problem\" go away  Like I said, none of these above \"issues\" make or break a place for me. They are just such small things that they could fix to make this place an amazing experience. The dining/bar area is so nice and upscale feel. Why not make the movie watching experience the same thing?"}
{"text":"My daughter bought tickets to Star Wars at SMG for us. The whole experience was GREAT!! The Blakend Chicken salad was to die for, the service great, and the movie was the best!! Highly recommend SMG to anyone who loves movies and eating. Plus BEER!!!"}
{"text":"CAUTION-HORRIBLE AND RUDE STAFF! I went to see a movie tonight and had the absolute worst customer service experience with a waitress! The waitress was extremely abrupt and rude. We were very polite and respectful to the waitress despite her lack of professionalism. As if the waitresses horrible attitude want enough, she lost my credit card and we had to wait for her to find it (talk about STRESSFUL)! THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AT ALL!   When I informed a manager of our horrible experience the manager didn't do anything about it and just nodded her head.    The theater itself is really neat but definitely overshadowed by the hostile environment that the staff itself create for the people who pay to keep them in business. I wouldn't recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked at the low reviews here.  I absolutely LOVE SMG.  The seats are great, although the \"office\" rows with the rolling chairs and counter are less preferable.  The theaters are small and the chairs are wide, so I never feel like I am being crowded by people to my side, in front, or behind.  If I'm going to a new movie with lots of hype or going on a holiday or other popular time, I reserve my seats ahead of time so there is no stress.  We almost always sit in the back row.  The staff have been wonderful every single time I have been to SMG.  That includes the ticket sales staff, the bartenders, the ticket takers, the wait staff, and the management.  I have never encountered anyone rude, but I believe you get back what you put forward, so maybe the complainers should look internally.  I've been to iPic, and yes, that is more luxurious, but at triple the price, no thanks.  SMG deserves all the support our community can give it.  I never want to go back to a traditional theater.  What's not to love about a place that let's me push a button and have a glass of wine delivered right to me!"}
{"text":"We had a fun time at Studio Movie Grill! I didn't see any of the problems that people reported in earlier reviews. We went to an early showing, using a groupon and had no trouble getting really good seats! We showed up about 40 minutes early and sat at the bar and perused the menu so we would be ready to order once we were seated.  The only reason I only gave 4 stars is some of the food quality was only so-so. I had Potato Skins that weren't very hot and my sour cream was very cold and hard to spread on my skins, they were just OK and I didn't finish them once they got cold. My hubby had what he described as a really good Angus burger, for only $1 more than a regular burger, worth the upgrade. The others in our party had a BBQ chicken wrap described as good, but mostly tortilla. No complaints on the Buffalo Chicken Strips. Those meals came with battered fries and everyone agreed that they were really good! Word of caution: since it's dark, I stuck my hand in my hubby's cup of ketchup while reaching for a fry, yuk!  Food prices were on par for the experience. Drink prices are a little high... $8 for a beer and same for vodka on the rocks, $9-$12 for a glass of wine. But worth it to be able to sip a drink while watching the movie! The most annoying part of the experience was trying to see the bill in the dark to see how much cash to put out and in the process missed a line in the movie that everyone else thought was funny!  I can see coming here again for a movie and probably getting the Cheese & Fruit plate and some wine to nosh during the film instead of eating a full meal. All-in-all, we had a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"I suppose that, for some, SMG would check off all the boxes needed for an evening's entertainment. IF you really want food delivered to you during a picture, by all means, this is the place to do it. But - if, like husband and I, you just want a quality movie-viewing experience without all the fancy frills and hoopla, there are better and more accommodating options out there.  We were supposed to meet some friends on Christmas day for a viewing of The Desolation of Smaug: a recent - but not opening day new - film. Upon arriving (about 25 minutes before showtime), we were informed that the seats were assigned (uh...what?), and the only ones left together were in the handicapped-accessible area. At a loss and feeling pressured, we bought the seats. Our friends showed up 10 minutes later and were told the show was sold out.   We would have asked for a refund so that we could find somewhere else to all see the film together, but there is a large sign at the ticket desk that emphatically states no refunds, no way, no how; maybe we could have asked for a manager and pressed our luck, but on Christmas day especially you just don't want to be *those people*. Our friends left for another theater, and husband and I went inside.  1) When we got in, we noticed at least 6+ open seats in pairs around the theater (which was TINY). These seats remained vacant for the entirety of the show. I don't know if SMG was deliberately underselling the show, or if the seats were somehow claimed (maybe by online sales that were no-shows? That somehow seems a bit unlikely, too), but it just seemed fishy to us that there were so many open seats in better locations compared to what was offered to us as \"the only thing left\", and that my friends were flat out told there were no seats left.  2) The seats were comfortable enough, except, with us being in the handicapped-accessible area, husband got stuck with an office chair instead of a regular plush seat. Meh.   3) Wow, okay. The whole food thing. I get it. I get that some folks want a meal with their movie, I really do. And the servers did generally try to be efficient coming in and out, and to duck under the screen. But, seriously? Major, MAJOR distraction. I want to be focusing on Gandalf battling nasties, not have my attention redirected to the server who's standing in the middle of the theater, confusedly looking around for who ordered the Thai chili nachos.   4) Again, assigned seating, say whaaaaa? Yeah, I understand that it probably helps with keeping track of the food orders/bills. But it's a pain in the butt if you try to make any kind of plans to meet with other people to see a show together. God help you if you don't show up at the same time!   To be clear: SMG didn't show us a bad time. I just don't think we were the clintele they aim to cater to, so their best efforts went unnoticed, and their failings stuck out a bit more. We probably won't be back, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't go, if you like what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Seats aren't comfortable, food is decent. Try to be a luxury movie theater, but clearly not the case."}
{"text":"I received 2 free tickets to this theater, so I checked out a film last week.  The idea of food and drinks being served at your seat is neat, but in all reality it's just so darn distracting. The service is great, but the servers try to \"duck down\" and run in front of you to serve people in your row and rows ahead of you.  It is so annoying, and the only saving grave for me was that there was no one else in my row so all the running was further towards the front of the theatre. I had a burger and sweet potato fries.  Good food and fair prices.  Even my soda was a good deal for a movie theater ($2.99 as I recall). I do think the executive office chairs (swivel style) that they have, with a counter to eat at, is odd.  Reminds me of a sports book at a casino.  Not sure why they did that, when they also have regular seats with a tray that slides towards you to eat/drink. Lobby is a bit small, and they make you get in line to wait for a theater.  So, even if only 5 people show up 25 minutes before the show, you must wait in line.  I heard other patrons state how weird this is too.  Too much cattle herding for my liking (especially when no crowds). We may go back, but lots of other choices that I like better."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night for the first time.  It's a different concept for a movie theater and I liked it overall.  We ate dinner at home before the movie, so we just grabbed some drinks and popcorn while we were here.    The seats are super comfy!  We got margs and popcorn - it was ok, but it was cool to order food while watching a movie.    I think it's something we'll do again :)"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love to eat while watching a movie?  If you don't mind people walking in front of you while the movies, then you should be fine.   I know I do! Especially a whole burger...sign me up again! My boyfriend took me here and we watched The Wedding Ringer. It was so funny. They have a variety of options for food like popcorn, salads, burgers, fish, and desserts.   I had the mushroom and swiss burger. It was moist and filling, so yummy. You can even choose turkey or vegetarian if you want to. There is also a sweet potato option for fries, and they were really yummy because they were crispy and not burnt.   The only thing I wish could be better is better seating. I wish they were more comfy than just regular desk chair and desk table.   Other than that, it was a nice place.  By the way, our dinner was about $50 so don't expect it to be cheap. On second thought, movie theatres are never cheap....."}
{"text":"Magical place to be! I was so mesmerized by the first time I ever walked in here. Wow talk about a classy looking establishment. They have a full service bar with a great lounging area when you first open the door you see it along with some pretty cool chandeliers.   Once you have your ticket you are given menus and the theater check in area and pointed to your theater room. Once you walk in your greater by friendly staff and staff that ask if you need any assistance walking or directed to your seats.   The seats are pretty awesome! They are more like recliners that's have a swivel table and a bottom on the table to order food and receive service. It's pretty dim so we normally pull out our phones and keep it on bright to read the menu.  Food is amazing! They do pride themselves on food. We normally go for the 2 for $25! Great portion size and the best part is your actually doing a dinner and a movie! Wow. Our go to is chicken nachos for appi then the American burger which we can never finish since they are huge and come with a great portion of their French fries! Seriously this is the best deal for two.   The end- as you walk out you are again greater by the staff in a line while one holds a bowl of mints to say have a great night. Now that final touch is fantastic!   The theater is normally packed because parking is always hard to find a spot. But we have come to realize if you arrive 10 mins before the movie time that's when other showtimes are out and getting into their cars. Perfect time to snatch a spot!"}
{"text":"every surface in this venue is disgusting, dirty, sticky, nasty, and GROSS.  this place has gone downhill for a while now, and after my visit on New years day, we will NEVER go back.   If I owned a business like this I would be ashamed."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this venue. What a fun concept to make a regular movie more like a night out or date.  We bought our tickets online and then went late Sunday afternoon. It was a manageable crowd and a pleasant movie going experience. We also happened to pick a winner movie which made it so much fun.  The chips for the nachos were paper thin so although tasty, they didn't hold up to the delicious ingredients on them.  Nice wine selection and the popcorn was good. We sat in desk like chairs at a counter and had lots of space and comfort.  I think the management must  improve on the cleanliness of the venue. The women's room needs an attendant because it was a mess. The bar in the lobby was sticky and to behind the bar had a number of dirty areas. This place is 25 miles away from us. We will definitely return but not for a quick flick."}
{"text":"Great experience. Food was surprisingly tasty. Service amazingly fast. Comfy seats. I'd totally go again!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner and a movie on New Year's Eve and, I hate to say it, we were completely disappointed with Studio Movie Grill. Some of the main reasons were:  1) Dirty - The floors had trash on them, the tables had spilled food that was obviously just wiped with a dry towel, smearing the food around.   2) Order - The drink order was wrong. And I had to ask when they would bring the drinks 20 minutes after we ordered.   3) Food - The wings were horrible. The menu said it was 1 pound of wings. What we received were 5, small, very dry wings.   The actual movie part was fine. Screen, sound, etc.   The movie was advertised to start at 4. Their website said to be there 20 minutes early. When we got there at 3:40, the waitress actually asked why we were there so early. Then, the movie didn't start until about 4:15.   Overall, it was just a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice now.  Here is what we like and don't like about SMG:  Likes - Fast ticketing.  These people really keep it moving along and you can pre-buy online. - Comfortable waiting area with a bar if you're a little too early for your movie. - Solid menu with all of your usual movie theater choices and then of course some you'd never expect (pizza, burger, wings).  Dislikes - Service has been shaky.  Both times they've tried to bring us someone else's order during the movie.  That's annoying when you're trying to watch a movie. - Seating isn't nearly as comfortable as iPic theater.  They're premium seats are nice but office chairs for those that don't feel like springing for the premium? - Sound quality.  We saw the new Die Hard movie this past weekend and one of the speakers on the left hand side was definitely blown.  The crackling of the sound was frustrating to say the least.  We would still go back to SMG but probably not by ourselves.  For a family movie outing it would be fun but for just the adults we'll head over to Scottsdale Quarter\" and iPic."}
{"text":"This theater is one of the few that serves food like this that allows children. The other theaters that are like this do not allow anyone under 21. I don't mind theaters choosing their clientele, but it sure is nice to bring the whole family to a theater like this."}
{"text":"The concept of this movie theater is awesome. We wish that they had these back in Cali only because it's nice to know that we have reserved seating and not have to wait in line hours in advanced for a premiere showing. We can walk in to the theater literally seconds before the movie starts knowing our seats are still there."}
{"text":"I always look forward to going to Studio Movie Grill. The theater looks fantastic; the food is great; the service is quick; and the Groupon is just the cherry on top.   I usually get the sweet potato fries and a soda, which is a perfect, and portioned, movie snack. Last time I went I got apples and peanut butter, which was good, but not incredibly exciting (I was trying to be healthy)."}
{"text":"We went there with the kids to see Frozen. I love the big wide seating. I love that you can order food and alcohol. There is plenty of space to move about if you have to leave in the middle of the movie... I mean plenty - the seating is limited. Do I expect a four star service and food quality there? No. It's a movie theater. The whole cost of the movie with some food, drinks and admission is not much more than a regular, crowded theatre that does not have tables, big comfy chairs or the space to move about.... and you can't get Blue Moon on draft in AMC.  You want something nicer - go to iPIC....be prepared to pay twice as much though."}
{"text":"Went on a date night with my wife on September 10, bought the 2 for $28 and a $4 soda, we got the coconut chicken, which made us both sick later on. Used a credit/debit card, had money in the account. I go and buy some food for my daughter on September 19 and I get an overdraft fee because I thought I had money in the account, but no...it takes Studio Movie Grill 9 days to take the money out. So now I have to come up with $43 to pay my bank."}
{"text":"Great concept , poor execution. The service was off to a good start when our initial server was very friendly, took our soda and popcorn order and advised us to press the service button if we needed anything during the movie . We got our soda within 5 minutes of ordering , so I thought hey maybe all those bad reviews are unwarranted. 1 hour later and half way through our movie , no popcorn. We paged for service and she apologized and brought us our popcorn. It's either poor training , communication , or a broken system between ordering and delivering   Next , we paged for service a little bit later for a refill on our soda, and she had the audacity to say \" I need to close out all the tabs right now I can't get you a refill\" THE HELL. So finish your tabs and bring back the refill. I paged for another service since she was extremely rude and I saw other patrons getting refills without any issue. The second service member came by for a refill.   I'd highly recommend better training or a revamp of your SOP. This was terrible service and I'd never go back to order anything. Movie is fine sure ,but don't expect to get any good service , food or anything in a timely manner. It's all very sporadic and random based on your luck and who's serving you."}
{"text":"Found deal on Groupon. Visited Charlotte NC for the first time and truly enjoyed this place. Staff was very nice, place was clean and relaxing, and the food was amazing! Also affordable, we got the 2 for $25 special."}
{"text":"Love this place! Rarely go anywhere else to watch movies. It's almost always on Groupon for $5 and have weekly features for $5 directly on their website, with no booking fee. So basically - the price to see a movie is very reasonable. You catch a flick and dine wile doing it. Their menu has everything for every taste. A personal favorite is the coconut tenders. They have amazing shakes and desserts too! Fast service. Great atmosphere. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect. Beats AMC and Harkins, hands down. The staff is eager to help, and very friendly. When they call the movie they are now seating, it does have an \"I'm at the airport, about to board\" type of feel. Which is awkward at first, then you get over it.   Walking into the theater, I was nervous to see the office chairs I heard about. It wasn't what people made them out to be. I mean, they are office chairs, but it is what it is. They also have huge chairs that have table in front of you to have your lunch, dinner or dessert. Before the movie starts, the servers come in to get your order, if you need anything else during the movie, you press a red service button, and out comes a server to assist you. LOVE IT. You no longer have to get up mid movie, to get a drink refill, just press your red service button, BAM, theres a server. They are very quick and friendly.   The huge chairs are very comfortable, however, the way they are positioned in a way that makes it awkward if you are on a date.  The office chairs are ok to look at, but would not want to sit in them after being in one for 8+ hours.   Overall, I had a great experience and will make this my choice for future movies at the theater."}
{"text":"Great Movie Theater, Terrible everything else.  We heard the service was poor so we ate before we came.  As far as the movie theater, the seats and table placing are good and the sound and picture was awesome.  If I was just paying to go see a movie this would get five stars.  However, from the time we pushed our request for service button it took over 10 minutes for someone to see us and another 25 minutes to actually get the drinks.  The drinks themselves were terrible.  We ordered a margarita and a Caribbean Hurricane.   Don't sit near the aisle because the servers use the aisles throughout the entire movie and can be distracting at times."}
{"text":"We had a good time last night at the Studio Movie Grill.  It's a great concept. The waiters/waitresses come to your seats and with the press of a button they will return for refills etc..  My only criticism.....my wife had the BBQ ribs and sweet potatoe fries....and we were quickly reminded we were in a movie theater, not a restaurant. Next time maybe just a soda and popcorn......."}
{"text":"This is a really fun theatre to go to. I love the personal service you receive and the menu has some great selections. What is so surprising is the food and drink prices are fairly reasonable as well as the ticket prices.  There is usually a Groupon available as well.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We've been to this location several times in the past year, always using our Groupon vouchers.   The idea is a great one. Along the lines of iPic or Ultra Star, it's a great concept!   Everytime we've gone (except last night) the theater has been relatively empty. This spoiled us.   I don't know WHY it was so busy on a Monday night in a Disney movie but it was beyond packed.  When the theater is packed, your experience will lack.  Ha...kind of rhymed there!  Okay, so I'm THAT mom who didn't take her kids to movies until they were 3, the reason being I didn't want to miss parts for potty breaks, or disrupt the other patrons. Turns out, I may be the only one that thinks this way!   We sat behind a row of people with FOUR babies. All under 12 months of age. It was late, they were tired. It was loud, they were scared. They were simply too young to be there & cried or jabbered loudly through the entire flick. Not one parent took their child out of the theater. The parents were also talking loudly, as if they were in their own living room. No peeps, you're sharing it was a bunch of other people & we don't appreciate it.  I understand this can happen in any movie theater, but it was amplified with the waiters coming in & out constantly (stooping to be polite but you still can't see the screen so stand up straight to get out of the way faster!).    On to the food. CRAP. Everything is made before hand or shipped, I'm sure of it.  It's just gross.  Here's the thing, if you go when you're hungry, you won't notice! But last night we had dinner at home & dessert at the movie....suddenly even though it was dark as I fished for my brownie, i realized - this is really gross!!  Burgers - eh. Mushroom burger - GROSS. Icecream - yum (but hard to see). Bownies - GROSS. Quesadilla - eh. Cookies - GROSS.  Yes, I AM a food snob. But I can go to In-N-Out & get a burger & know what I'm in for. For under $5. Here, you spend $9-$12 on a meal & it is like a Denny's reject.   We go here because we get vouchers for $5 per person......you get what you pay for I suppose."}
{"text":"After having countless positive experiences at the old Epicentre Theaters, I was saddened to see them close.  They offered a unique movie experience and I loved that you could take cocktails and food into the theater! It was always clean and the staff was always stylish and professional.   Upon my first visit to the new Studio Movie Grill and theater, I had high hopes that they would continue the trend I had become accustomed to.  Upon arrival, I quickly realized that they too offer a unique experience, but not in a good way!  The only positive thing I can find to say about it is that the ticket price was reasonable.  The cocktails were awful and took forever to get.  The popcorn was DISGUSTING! I mean, a movie theater should at least be able to get popcorn right! It was beyond distracting to have servers walking up and down the aisles the entire movie, often completely blocking the screen.  With people ordering and receiving food/drinks the whole time, it was incredibly noisy and hard to hear the actual movie.  My friends ordered the chicken nachos and when they finally came, the were completely cold and stale tasting. At the climax of the film, all of the servers were stumbling around dropping off and picking up everyone's checks which caused everyone to have the lights on their phones turned on to fill out their bills.  The staff all seemed nice, but it was almost like it was everyone's first job.  There wasn't any professionalism or poise.  After the movie ended, I noticed a line of people all complaining that their bills were wrong.  Even though the tickets were reasonable, after the ticket cost, popcorn, and 4 cocktails (between two of us, not just me) I spent over $70 for a COMPLETELY underwhelming movie going experience! All I can say is that under no circumstance can I imagine ever coming back. In the future I guess if I want a cocktail in a movie theater, I'll just stop at the abc store on the way ;)"}
{"text":"After visiting another SMG I knew I was lucky to have this one so close. The staff is friendly, helpful, and always makes for an enjoyable experience. The food is also pretty good. I have gone for the pizza night which is a great deal. My go to dish is the chicken quesadilla. It is very good! They also have great desserts if you have already eaten dinner."}
{"text":"I ended up here because it is the only place that accepts the MoviePass e-tickets in my area. I haven't received my card from MoviePass just yet so I thought I'd try this out.   First, they validate parking which was a relief. Second, the e-ticket check in was really easy. You can even pick your seat you want in the app.   The theater was nice. A smaller room than most but it had a nice, intimate feel. Each seat had a tray and cupholder. Mine had a few crumbs on it from the previous show. Not a big deal, but I did notice. The seats are really comfortable. They don't recline but they are padded and there is a ton of leg room. The leg room is mostly for the servers to get through the aisle easier but it allows you to stretch out.  The service was pretty good, you press a button on the tray and a server comes out to take your order. All in all, it's a pretty cool experience. They didn't have a ton of beer options but they did have the local brewery I like on tap so I was happy.  Overall, good experience. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Took an hour to get a soggy pizza. Never got the popcorn we ordered. Had to talk to 3 servers to get it taken off our check. No toilet paper or paper towels in the bathroom. To top it off no draft beer in the theater only the bar?"}
{"text":"First of all, don't pay full ticket price here. Groupon ALWAYS has a great deal for this place ($5/per ticked plus a free drink, I think the usual price is $12.95).   My boyfriend and I came here last night with our Groupon Tickets to see The Words and were quite impressed with our experience. The inside is like a lounge, with nice places to sit and a bar. You pick your seats on a screen, and being a couple, we picked the seats that sat close together. This was a very good idea.   Firs of all, even if you're not a couple, pick the love seats. They are nice big plushy seats and are spaced far comfortably away from everyone else. If you pick the individual seats...they suck. The individual seats are rolly office chairs that sit in back of a long counter...that just can't be comfortable.   We went to a late showing, so decided to get dessert, especially since the food is kind of pricey. I have a wheat allergy, so they brough me a kid's ice creme sundae since the only sundae they had on the adult menu had a brownie on it. I thought it would be small (since it was kids) but it was actually quite large and was probably around $3-4. My boyfriend got a peanut butter shake for I think about $5, plus we each got free drinks from the tickets. Both of us enjoyed our food very much. I did look at the prices for other food, sides are around $5-8, and entres range from around $10-15.   I thought the servers flitting around the room would be really annoying...but it was only kind of. They whispered pretty quietly, but sometimes the people ordering weren't that quiet. It was pretty funny to see them run back out of the theater while attempting to duck down.   All in all, I am satisfyed with our experience. As I said earlier, I wouldn't pay full price, but I'm definitely going back to Groupon to buy some coupons to take my little sister sometime!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give them NO STARS. Worst experience EVER. I recently moved to Charlotte and was excited to check out SMG, esp since there was a Groupon. we got there around 8 pm. Put in our dinner order at 8:03. We order 2 waters, 2 whisky sours,pretzel bites, chicken tenders, nachos, and sweet potato fries. 30 minutes later and the movie is playing and we still have not received anything...not even our drinks. So I buzz for help, ask the waitress about our drinks and she brings out 2 \"whisky sours\"...still no water. Whisky sours were not even mixed...literally first sip was all sour. I stop our original waiter 15 minutes later asking him where is our water and food. He looks confused and goes gets the waters...tells me to be patient for the food ( mind you we only orders apps). Now it's 1.5 hours into a 2 hour movie and still NO food. I stop another waiter to ask about the food, they went to check and never came back. 5 minutes later, a new waiter comes back to give us the bill...full bill. I inform him that I will not be paying seeing as how I haven't even eaten yet. He apologizes and comes back 5 minutes later saying the food order was just put in. They come out with our food. I could tell how quickly they put together the order seeing as  chicken was not all the way cooked and my fries were cold. We barely ate. So I didn't fuss thinking they obviously were not going to charge us. 5 minutes later the guy comes back and gives us the check. My brother at this point is pissed, goes and gives him back the bill and says he will not be paying for such poor service. They still charged us for two drinks and we left. WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER. Just go to a normal cinema, this was a waste of time."}
{"text":"Well it's definitely good for the money, pricing is close to the same of a regular theatre. So here's my pros & cons Pros: low prices, you can get reserved seating online, lots of restaurant type meal choices which you can eat in bar area, or inside the theatre, decent size movie screen, lots of servers, and greeters, and pretty family friendly. It's alot more casual than ipic. Also, for a Friday evening getting tickets to Breaking Dawn was not a problem, no line or anything! And lots of parking too.  Cons: the speaker in the theatre wasn't working, kept crackling so loud there were parts of the movie I couldn't hear. There is no happy hour in bar area ever, the seats were very strange, I felt like I was in school or at work. There was no personal space between me and the person sitting next to me. It's overstaffed, and hard to hear the person announcing the movie they were lining people up for.   Tip: they re still giving 2 free movie tickets online!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had bought the groupon deal for $5 tickets and yesterday was the last day to use them so we came uptown for dinner and a movie.  They still haven't streamlined their process yet, it took quite a bit to get our tickets because they were trying out a new scanner.  We had never seen a movie at the Epicentre Theater before it changed hands because it was so crazy expensive but I think Studio Movie Grill has the right idea, everything is mid-range in price.  $10 is average for a movie & the food and drinks are pretty average priced too and if you remember to get your ticket validated parking is free.    Tuesdays are also half price tickets for ladies ($5) but when every single movie is either a war movie, sports movie or a dumb spoof scary movie, you won't be getting many ladies to attend.  That is my biggest complaint, the lack of diversity in the movies.  It seems they're catering more to the single 20 something bank worker.  We settled on 42 because it looked interesting, otherwise I would have let the groupon expire.    Be careful of where you put your elbows on your arm rest/food tray, as Tim and quite a few people around us kept accidentally hitting it with their elbows.  Service was pretty quick although you could tell there were some trainees, food was getting delivered to the wrong chair pretty consistently, but it has to be hard to deliver food in the dark!    The food was average, a step above fast food.   The chicken tenders looked nothing like what they kept showing on the screen and despite the fries being listed as seasoned, there was no seasoning or salt on them and since we were all the way at the top of the theater I didn't want to make one of the servers walk all the way up there just for salt.  I also would have liked more variety of candy.      I definitely want to come back when they do one off movies, they have quite a few $1 movie nights and they're showing some more artsy independent films too but I think I'll eat somewhere else beforehand."}
{"text":"I just love this place!!!  It's quickly becoming my Friday night spot for fun & food....and drinks! Lol"}
{"text":"Great facilities and friendly service. It did take some time to get a drink refill. Actually, the patron to my right received my drink. That wasn't so bad but what was I was a little disconcerted is that he also got my credit card after I closed my tab. Methinks they need to hammer out some kinks in their system."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Studio Movie grill for the first time last week.  They really have the dining/drinking/movie thing down.   The concept is really great; no need to get dinner before the movie.  The servers work together; we had 3 people take our order  and deliver our drinks and appetizer.  They appear to have two rows of seats on each seating level, one row at a bar with office chairs that rock, and one with leather chairs and side tables.  We chose the leather chairs and I was really disappointed with their comfort, they didn't recline or move in any way.  Also, two tall guys sat in front of us at the bar seats and obscured our view of the movie.  The theater sound was very good. Our food was OK, we ordered hummus and veggies with pita.  The hummus didn't have much flavor and the pita was more of a flat bread, very flavorful but loaded with sodium.   I thought the facility was rather worn looking but not awful. Personally, I would rather attend a movie at a theater with the reclining leather chairs and get my snacks at the snack bar/bar areas."}
{"text":"Yay! I'ma a fan. A fan indeed! Love the concept of dining in the cinema. Wonderful!!! I don't know why all theatres don't do this. $30.00 on popcorn and a small drink, or an app, entree, dessert, and or a drink?!! Can't beat that with a stick. Though I must say, I don't know how much a ticket cost for a movie lol. I've been to two events here (in the same week) and they were both free. Shame on me haha! The only set back for me is that there aren't any fish options on the menu. Lots of great choices, but not really something for everyone. I was surprised by how good the food actually was. The chef came into the theatre at both events that I attended and was very friendly. He wanted to ensure that everyone enjoyed their meal. Nice touch. I should have suggested that they offer a \"grilled\" entree option. It is \"Studio Movie Grill\" after all. Would grilled salmon be too smelly in the movie? I don't think so. There are plenty of people there to ensure that your movie/dining experience is stellar. Almost too many people. I thought that everyone running around the theatre during the movie delivering food and drinks would be a distraction. It's not lol. It's a great alternative to your regular movie experience. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This seems like it would be a cool experience, and I can see why people would be stoked on it, but it's just not for me.  When I hear \"leather recliners\" I'm thinking plush lazy boy chairs and that is NOT what I got-- they have reclining and office chairs, both were uncomfortable for two hours.  But it is fun to go and check out, especially if you have never been to a place like this before, but if you've been to any of the other 21+ movie theatres, like the Lux theatres in Californis, this will be a total disappointment.  I'm not saying don't go, I'm just saying it wasn't what I expected and I probably won't be going back.  Also, I got the groupon for a movie and free soda and they tried to charge me for the sodas, but I only had to remind them once and the charges came right off."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I saw a film last night and had such a nice time! The food is good, and reasonably priced; however, what really blew us away was the staff! Every staff member was so kind and so helpful! We truly felt like very special, valued customers and left in such a pleasant mood. Our only regret walking out of theater was that we didn't leave a larger tip!"}
{"text":"Went tonight for the first time. I've never been to a theater that served food and drinks like this. I assumed servers would be quieter since a movie was going on, nope. My friend and I ordered the same items, chicken tenders and fries. Mine came out about 15-20 minutes after hers. I know it doesn't take that long to cook those items and considering we ordered at the same time, they could've been made at the same time. I also heard another group near us who didn't get stuff they ordered either. A couple of stalls had no toilet paper either but the theater was nice and clean. Oh well. I'll probably go back for a movie but won't order and food or drinks."}
{"text":"Staff here is super friendly. Place seemed a little dirty though. The movie felt overly loud, but otherwise it is a neat place to have a bite to eat while watching a movie on a hot summer day! I think their menu is a 2-3 star. Not super impressed with the food. It needs to be better quality for sure."}
{"text":"If you're looking to inhale human body odor and quell from malodorous meals, while deafening yourself with an excessively loud movie, in attempt to mute the constant conversations between a disruptive influx of servers and fellow moviegoers, then go to Studio Movie Grill. Otherwise, remain dignified and attend a normal theater, eat some popcorn, and enjoy the movie; don't seat yourself on grease-stained, Craigslist bought leather seats. Studio Movie Grill is simply one more disgusting stench away from regurgitating your self-respect."}
{"text":"Don't do it!!  Don't even think about doing it!!  Go to Harkins, go to Ipic, heck, rent a movie from Red Box and watch it at home, and you will still far surpass the bad experience that you are bound to have at Studio Movie Grill.    After reading all of the bad reviews, I thought to myself, no way, it can't be that bad, these people are just being dramatic. Oh was I ever wrong.  I almost had to laugh as each and every bad thing I read about in previous reviews happened to us while we were there.  First of all, don't expect to get a drink from the bar if you arrive early for your movie.  You will sit at the bar waiting as the bartender meanders back in forth in front of you, not acknowledging you, not actually working, and not really doing anything but scowling.  After sitting for over 7 minutes (3 other guests as the bar total, thats a walk in the park for any bartender, I know, i bartended for 5 years), we finally got frustrated and left our bar seats and sat on a bench.  We watched as a couple who sat down after us also became frustrated with the poor service, got up from their seats, and went and sat elsewhere.  At this point, I was laughing a bit because other reviewers had said very similar things about the terrible bar service, but seriously, this is THE worst service I have ever had at a bar in my life!  Next we went to the theater to be seated.  The \"hostess\" who seats guests, was probably about 17 years old, and was drunk with the power of seating the theater.  While she was not rude ot me, i watched as she treated many other guests rudely, and then loudly began talking about her personal life with a fellow patron who was clearly a stranger.  She also loudly complained about how she was in charge of seating the largest theater in the SMG, and how much hard work it is to tell people where to sit, and how she is sooooooo good at it. L.O.L. your seat is printed on your ticket, or you're general admission.  Theres only two places to seat people, their pre assigned seat, or direct them to general seating,  Seriously.  Easiest job in the world.  When it came time to order, our server was very pleasant, took our order, typed in her little electronic thing, and left.  We never saw her again.  Runners brought our food before our drinks even arrived.  We began eating and were getting really thirsty.  We flagged another server down asking about our drinks, she said she would take care of it. We never sae that server again, either.  An hour later, food finished, dishes cleared, still no drinks.  I finally gave up hope on them arriving, and good thing I did because I never did see them.  Finaly our check arrives, and surprise surprise, we were charged for the drinks.  It only took about 30 minutes to get them taken off and the check brought back.    basically worst service in the world.  A coupel of other things:  ambiance is terrible--it feels like youre going to a work conference.  very awkward setting.  Also, womens bathroom-flooded, floor was wet and STINKY, all sinks were half full with backed up water.  It smelled like a port o potty in there, sick, and not a wet floor sign in sight although the floor was slippery as heck.    Save your money, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Really phenomal experience from start to finish. Friendly service and quick service. One stop shop for dinner and a movie. Movie going for the grown folks!"}
{"text":"We bought a groupon to this theater. The movie was great (\"Gone Girl\"). The seating is like a lecture hall with nice business chairs. The food was mediocre. The chicken nachos were like a salad, the burgers were sugary and the fries tasted like they'd been sprinkled with cinnamon, sugar, and salt. Very odd."}
{"text":"For the price and experience- this is a great place!  Food was good but not outstanding. I'd relate it to a chilis or Applebee's type. Came in fancy plates & dishes though, so that's nice.   Atmosphere is awesome, especially when you enter and don't feel like your in the typical movie theatre.   Seats are not comfortable. This is the only reason I gave it a 4 star and not 5. We saw a 2 hour and 45 minute movie, and we were uncomfortable for more than half of the movie. Luckily, we could order food to get our minds off the lousy seats!  Seems like most seats would have a good view. Screen is nice, as well as sound. Theatre is pretty large.   Do yourself a favor and pre select your seats online. It's stressful going in and having to \"rush\" the doors. It's only 50 cents per ticket to pre select, so do so."}
{"text":"Okay, it's not Ipic but neither are the prices. It's a good value and the food and service are top notch. My husband and I go there often because we like to be able to select our seats on the opening night of a new movie. I love their Girls Night Out movies each month and for $5 a ticket, it's a great way to get together with friends. My college-aged son loves their happy hour prices in the bar. Overall, I'm glad we have SMG here in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Matthew is the worst bartender and extremely rude. When asked to speak to a manager he was just as disrespectful. Ordered the pop corn and it was stale, over priced, and cold. Ordered  two bud lights and a vodka lemonade and it was $23. There was not a full pour of vodka in the drink and asked for another one he put half a shot in and charged an extra $8. This is horrible customer service and we will not be back.   Oh my goodness. The waitress threw the check presenter at me and WALKED AWAY. After I was sitting there watching the movie. Sorry sweetie that was extremely disrespectful."}
{"text":"The only reason this theater got two stars is because of the drinks/ 5 buck groupon and location in conjunction to free parking center city. To start off the staff is not aware of the interruptions they cause. It takes forever for food to come and the food is not much better than fast food. The popcorn is often overdone and salty. The movie is so loud... to the point you can barely enjoy the movie. The foot traffic is high outside in the multi-use area but that is due to location which is expected but upscale should not be the defining term for this theater.  There are so many better options!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has not gotten more reviews and good ones at that.  Went last night after I received a free coupon admitting 2 adults in. We were greeted by a very friendly staff and did not run into once employee that was disgruntled or not genuinely happy to see you there.  We were a little late for the movie but able to find somewhere to sit as there were 2 options available. You can either try and get an area with the leather/plush chairs that have a movable arm rest (makes it great for date nights out) and there are some areas where it is a row of office like chairs behind the leather chairs'; with an area blocking the office chairs from the leather ones that double as tables for the office chairs.  It was very convenient to have the service button; I pressed it before I had a chance to actually look at the menu when our server arrived. The service was very prompt; was informed of the specials they had (margarita Monday's - $2 dollars off any margarita drink) and our food was pretty good. I had the coconut chicken, strawberry frozen margarita and my date had the angus burger. Everything was very tasty.  We were able to enjoy the movie without worrying to get up for more drinks or snacks; not to mention they have a full bar and dinner menu to order from.  I would definitely be going back regardless if I have free tickets or not."}
{"text":"Like many other theaters that are now offering full service dinner, the concept of SMG is great but it's the execution of this concept that is truly lacking. Let me begin by saying the hubby and I had a 50/50 kind of night when we went to watch Safe House this evening at SMG. Once we were seated and received our food, we truly did enjoy the movie and the perk of getting to eat real food while watching. The servers themselves were nice, fairly quick and considerate during the movie. Throw in the fact that the movie itself was good...we were quite happy when the credits rolled and we walked out at the end of the night.  Unfortunately, we were far from happy the first half of the evening. We arrived at the theater at 6:30pm only to be told that the 7:20pm show was pretty much full and we'd be stuck in the front. Having been turned away a couple weeks before for the same reason we were prepared for this and ready to wait for the 8:40pm show. So we waited. And this is where SMG's execution could use some work.   This place is busy. Granted, it's a Saturday but the problem is that there is no where for all the people who are waiting for movies to well, wait! There's a small bar and some cushions scattered around the lobby which is stifling hot I might add. It feels like you're at an airport terminal or at an amusement park waiting for an attraction.   After all the waiting you get called into your respective lines (according to when you purchased your tickets or if you bought reserved seating) which is a mad dash amidst a grumpy, impatient and liquored up crowd. Once you've scrambled to your line you wait some more until they let you in to the theater which is then another mad dash to snag prime seating (unless you have reserved seats).   As I mentioned earlier, hubs and I were lucky to be in Group 1 and let into the theater first after reserved seating so we were able to sit in the more comfy leather chairs with the swinging dining tray attached. If you're not so lucky you end up in ordinary office chairs lined up in front of a small counter-like tabletop. Talk about uncomfortable.   This is the point where our night turned around and we were no longer grumpy or irritated and actually was able to enjoy our movie. Food was decent, as expected for a quick serve kitchen, and prices weren't cheap but that's to be expected.   Bottom line: know what you're getting into when you go here.  1. Get there early if you haven't purchased reserved seats online beforehand. If you think you can arrive with 20 minutes til your movie....you will not get in.  2. Be prepared to wait around and fight the crowds for a decent spot in line...or you're doomed to a dinky office chair for the entire movie.  If SMG were able to execute the front end of the moviegoer experience then I'd be pleased. As it is, it's not very relaxing or appealing to feel crowded, impatiently stand around and compete for comfy seating. Not my idea of a fun night out so the hubby and I are probably not going back to this particular dinner/movie theater. It's just simply not worth the trouble and discomfort which is disappointing because the actual concept, once you get there, is pretty darn cool.   Good luck to all you fellow Groupon users...be prepared and hope you can have a better overall experience than we did."}
{"text":"This was the worst movie experience I have ever had. It took a ridiculous amount of time for service and then by the time we got food it was cold. The bathrooms were dirty and almost every toilet was not in use. There was a drunk patron in the theater cussing and saying uncomfortable things. And to top it off the popcorn machine was BROKEN!"}
{"text":"have been here a few times now and have to say everyone is nice and helpful and friendly but the food is never up to par. i really expect better quality and freshness for the price you pay the theater is very comfortable and the seats are great. but wont eat here again. even the popcorn could use improvement"}
{"text":"So I went for my anniversary. Movie started at 810 we wasnt able to go in til 810 (I arrived at 730) movies comin out soon was already rolling.so  we sit.  The couple behind us was coughing and  sneezing so I asked to sit somewhere else(which I was able to) so now im at the very top row. I order chicken nachos with just chicken and cheese,  coconut chicken and peperoni pizza. My drinks come out and then my nachos with everything on it(peppers, tomato, cheese n chicken) im allergic to tomatoes so I switch it to chips n salsa which is very tomatoe so im just eating chips then my pizza come out but with coconut shrimp which Im allergic to the point I cant even smell it...once I realized what it is now im itching and coughing so I tell the server(cuz he at the couple next 2 me) then he takes it pass me..so I go and finds a manager amd hes like o im sorry ill have a talk with my staff.. horrible so now on my anniversary im broke out like a blowfish n the face and itcy. .it will b awhile b4 I go back"}
{"text":"Came here for the Magic Mike's Ladie's night Yelp event.  What an awesome place to come watch a movie, friendly staff, and clean.  Very hip, definitely different way to a boring movie night.  It is a great place for an date, family or just having a girls night out.  Love it!!  I will definitely have to bring my family here to watch a movie or come back here for an movie date night with my husband.  They offer variety of selection on their menu, from Chicken tenders, pizza, salad...etc  Price is decent, we had their chicken tenders, burger bites, and buffalo chicken bites;  I had an Ice tea and my friend had a beer, our bill was under $30, plus watched an awesome movie and had a great girls time.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool. Food was really good and staff were very nice. I wish the seats we sat in were at a little higher elevation than the row in front of us but it was empty so no issues there."}
{"text":"I miss Mez. I miss the bar as you exit the escalator, which is now covered with a creepy dark curtain. I miss the toilet paper in the bathrooms. I miss the clean floors, free of trash, boxes and bins. I miss the chocolate mousse dessert and the more refined menu, which has now been replaced by something more akin to TGIFridays. I miss not having an awkward swivel table, blocking the drink holder, with an obnoxious LED light. All of the special that was getting dressed up to go to the movies uptown is now gone. After raving about the \"nice movie theater uptown\" and then taking my family to SMG last evening, I'm thoroughly disappointed and embarrassed. I'm giving SMG a 2 star rating because I did not get good poisoning."}
{"text":"Go to the bar, have a drink.  Shoot a little pool, have a drink.  Walk into the theater, have a drink.  Sit down...eat, drink, and watch a movie. Doesn't get much better!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place my mom loves it so I always take her here but they have made it soooo hard to get tickets their website almost never works and this time I got a Groupon but the website won't take the groupon but you have to get seats in advance but they don't have anyone in the store you can call so I have to drive up there today and hope I get seats together for tomorrow.... I shouldn't be punished because they decided to work with Groupon and I assumed they had already done their jobs to figure how that would work.... seems like they are going to get railroaded by ipic if they continue this low budget inefficient management .... bummer"}
{"text":"This food is pricey here but the seating and service plus movie tickets that are not overpriced keep us going back occasionally.  We like to take the kids here to splurge on movie nights and get dinner all in one.  They have great menu options and a full bar.  The seating is very spacious and comfortable."}
{"text":"That's better. We used our free comp ticket from the disaster evening and saw another movie. Fast service, good food, no problems. So, hopefully that was a one shot loser night."}
{"text":"Love going here to watch movies, but the last two times the food hasnt been that good. The food was cold. Nothing like eating french fries that taste 2 days old and cold."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience!  I am from out of town and did not know how this theater worked.  I checked in at the second-floor counter, but had bought my ticket through Fandango and the girl at the counter would not not help me.  She just told me to go upstairs and she went back to talking to her friends.  The escalator was closed for repairs, so I had to interrupt her and ask her how to get there.   After going outside and back in on the third floor, I was met with a crowd of people checking in for some event, and I had to literally shove my way though just to get in the door.  Where is a manager keeping things organized?  I assumed I had to find another ticket counter, but didn't see one or anyone else to ask, so I went to the ticket taker.  She ignored me for a while and then waited on other people behind me in line, so I had to interrupt her just to ask if I needed something other than my confirmation number.  She said no, but the movie wasn't seating yet.  OK, so how about an idea on when I should come back?    I waited until 10 minutes before the movie time and checked back in, and was sent on my way with a menu.  No explanation of what to do or help finding my seat.  OK, perhaps being rude and letting people fend for themselves is how this theater does business.    I got my order in during the credits, then watched as everyone else got drinks and appetizers.  I finally got a soft drink, even though I ordered an iced tea.  I got my beer, but no glass to drink it from.  I had to wait 20 minutes to get my drink order corrected, and still no food.  After one hour of watching everyone else enjoy their dinner, I called for service to check on my food.  Some idiot said he would check, and then promptly ignored me.  Another 20 minutes later, I called for service again, same idiot, this time I asked to see a manager.  Nothing again.  They brought my check, I informed this person that I never got my food and wanted to see a manager, and nothing.  No apologies, no offers to try to help or make it right, just walked away and did nothing.  The same idiot came back again in response to my next call for service, and acted like he had no clue that this was the third time I had asked to see a manager!   No manager ever came, no apologies were ever given, nothing.  When I left, the manager was at the exit and choose to turn his back on me and ignore me - as is the policy at Studio Movie Grille - until he was ready to talk to me.  I explained the situation, to which he accused me of not wanting to be interrupted during the movie.  Amazing, despite three clear requests he has the nerve to accuse me of not wanting to be interrupted!  He did offer an apology that there was a \"miscommunication\"...not for ruining my evening or leaving me hungry or refusing to serve me or for the rudeness of his staff or the total incompetence they displayed or their lack of concern over a dinner guests sitting there with no food or ignoring my many requests...just for miscommunication.  He erased the charges for the food that I never got.  I explained that I shouldn't even have to pay for the movie because instead of enjoying it, I had to sit there and fight to get someone to wait on me!  Since the tickets were through Fandango, all he could do was offer to try to get me a refund.  Hey, how about sending me home with a pizza or something since It's 9:30 and I still haven't had dinner yet?    I am not from Charlotte, but I do travel here often, and I will never frequent this theater again."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite movie theater in Charlotte since it opened. The seating is comfortable and the food is generally great. It is much better than the similar concept theater, Cinebarre in the Arboretum (uncomfortable seating and overpriced low-quality food).  The last two times I went there, however, I had poor experiences...  I went to see Hunger Games with a group of friends and the theater was really busy. Our food took a long time to get there. Once I got my food, it was cold with congealed dipping sauce. They also served my vegetarian friend food packed with bacon after she requested no bacon. Then, they charged her twice for her meal. They did give me return passes, so I was ready to forgive and forget.   I went to see Star Wars with the same friend and once again they were really busy. However, they claimed they were having a special menu when we arrived. It was actually a limited menu because of some sort of electricity failure. I ended up ordering popcorn that was old, overpriced, and way too salty. By the time our movie was over, we saw servers walking around with trays of food. Meanwhile, we were starving because we had basically skipped lunch on account of our pre-purchased tickets. We picked a movie theater that served food for a reason. Once again, they gave me return passes.  I am unsure if I just had two isolated poor experiences or if SMG has gone downhill.  I look forward to re-evaluating this review in the future and hope I will be able to raise my rating."}
{"text":"I decided to FINALLY use my MoviePass after paying $10 a month for it for the past SEVEN months but only having used it once.  I saw the much-vaunted \"Avengers:  Infinity War\".  The good:  Studio Movie Grill takes MoviePass with no issue.  The check-in process was easy.  The bad:  The staff was terrible.  I was 30 minutes into the film before someone came to check on me.  When they finally brought the food, it wasn't very good.  The staff never checked on me.  I had to ask for a to-go box twice, with the last time time me walking up to the bar to get it.  The only reason I'm giving two versus one stars is that I've gone to this location twice before, and the service and food quality were acceptable.  I'm not sure what happened this time, but it was bad enough that I won't be coming back.  ****************************************** Update:  Per comments from SMG, I addressed the issue further via e-mail.  I very much appreciated that the Customer Support team was attentive to my concerns by responding quickly, showing empathy for the poor service experience, and committing to do better in the future.  This is a good example of how to turn the situation around and restore my confidence in their business.  I'm upgrading from two stars to four."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Super cool movie experience. Daily drink specials and  $25 food special for two. Had chicken nachos, BBQ bacon burger with fries and pizza. Couldn't possibly eat all of it. Way better than overpriced popcorn and soda. Tickets aren't expensive and there's a Groupon currently for them too. I'd def go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere! Really appreciate being able to reserve seats and show up at your own leisure! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Very clean movie theatre courtesy courtesy employees polite and professional sit down and they serve you awesome place to go watch a movie"}
{"text":"At first impression I thought that having dinner at a movie house wouldn't work. But it does.  I have been here twice now.  The food is your typical hamburgers, pizzas, pastas and fried stuff.  I don't think it is that overpriced considering that you are in a movie theatre.  The mark up is not as high as the mark up on movie candy in most theaters. They have cocktails with daily specials.   It is ok tasting for what it is.  The only problem is that if you are seated next to a big fat pig as I was today who kept ordering more food and more food and more food, it is very disruptive during the movie.  The umpteen conversations between the server and this person discussing her food went on and on to the point that I missed some of the dialogue.  Very annoying.  Order your food, eat it, shut up and watch the movie.  Thank you."}
{"text":"My first visit great. 2nd visit, not so. Ordered food before the movie. Server never asked how we wanted our burger cooked. Decided we wanted appetizers after placing our lunch order, was told it was too late to order wings, took too long to cook, never brought out silver wear or napkins, mixed drinks were watered down so bad, I don't ever drink so 1 drink should have done the trick. It was like drinking water. I ordered a long island tea, same thing! Like water but with a splash of lemon juice! Considering I paid 9 + a drink & pain for dinner, drinks & a movie for 3 this was not by any means a great celebration! 2 thumbs down! This was mid day on a Monday. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We get groupons and go ALL the time. The food is great and the prices are not bad at all. And with the groupon purchase you get a free drink! I am extremely impressed every single time I come here (which is a lot). We only use studio movie grill when we go out to the movies now. We went to the Tempe Marketplace movie theater last week with one of my husbands friends because he is closer to Tempe and it felt so weird because I hadn't been to a \"regular\" movie theater in forever!  I absolutely love the fact that they have special needs screenings and whatnot too. My little brother is autistic and he thought it was really cool when I told him about that. It made him feel really important. And its free for him and me because I'm his sister! I cannot tell you how awesome it is that they have this available. AND they turn the movie down a bit and have some of the lights left on so that its not too ridiculously loud or dark in there!  Thank you Studio Movie Grill for all the cool things you offer and especially all you do for kids with special needs! This place is AWESOME."}
{"text":"Always have a great time at this theatre! The food is B+ at best but in my opinion that's more than fine for movie night.   The staff have always been friendly and fast. They DO VALIDATE for EpiCentre parking but REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR TICKET! They must have a movie ticket stub to validate so make sure you don't throw it away.   Great spot for a date, family outing or any other type of cinematic adventure."}
{"text":"This was my first experience since the change to SMG from EpicCentre.  Lets say I absolutely love this place!  I purchased coupons from Groupon and when i went to the counter to get my tickets the front desk was amazing. Very helpful. I love the fact that you now have assigned seating so no more looking for an empty seat. Those days are history. When you walk in the theater there are employees to direct you to your seat. LOVE IT!  We chose the \"love seats\" which have an arm rest in the middle but you can lift it to get the true \" at home cuddle\" that you want with your spouse while looking at the movie if you choose too. :) Attached to your chair is a tray that is easily moved should you need to leave your seat. It has an attached red button that you push to your waiter to your table. It is awesome. No filling out forms or having to get there early to take your food to your table. When the staff comes to your table they are very discreet and sit down on the steps beside you and whisper your order back to you once you've told them.  The food was absolutely fantastic! I have the appetizer sampler. I believe it was cheesebread with some lovely spices, buffalo wings, chicken quasadilla and nachos with salsa. Lovely displayed alone with dipping sauces in glass dishes!! ( i personally love that) The prices were not expensive at all compared to the normal prices of just popcorn and a drink. We had a milkshake, 2 margarita with extra Patron shot, the sampler of 4 for only $32.00 Bucks!!!  The theater is really dark so you don't really see the bodies moving around delivering food during the movie.  I have only one complaint, during the climax of the movie my waitress came to settle the bill, but with the LOOK i gave the immediately walked away. After the movie she did apologize and I left her an AWESOME tip :)  So please go enjoy!  I bet you will love it!  Billie"}
{"text":"Neat place! You can order food, beverages, snacks. The decor is nice as well as the comfy seating.   French Fries- always delicious!!! The ranch and ketchup combo is great!   Margarita pizza- Yucky, raw, doughy. Unfortunately it was uncooked with both types of dough.   Hendrick tonic- Pretty decent"}
{"text":"I recently had the opportunity to experience the new movie theater, Studio Movie Grill, this past Tuesday. The movie theater has only been open for a total of 4 days from the grand opening on Friday the week prior.   The layout of the movie theater I found to be quite plesant. It is very modern and sleek. The customer service was decent. Everyone was friendly for the most case; however, the operation at the bar was quite slow and the service was not the best. Everywhere else I found the service to be nice.   The men's bathroom must have a broken pipe because it really smells in there."}
{"text":"Cheap movie tickets and food is well priced. The food is what makes me give this a 3-star as it is usually pretty average. Besides that, always clean and comfy seats if you don't get the rolling desk chairs"}
{"text":"I honestly really like this place!!  I get it!!  It's mostly because I get this sweet Groupon deal, movie and drink for just $6, GET OUT OF HERE!!  No, but seriously, this place is small and quaint, but very accommodating with comfy recyclable chairs and a bar for those who like a little drink with entertainment. They also offer other meal options, like burgers and stuff. I also noticed that Groupon has it for $5, for the solo movie pass, but that is still a pretty good deal that is worth the visit!! So instead of complaining about this hot Summer weather, go enjoy a good movie, in this air conditioned and food accommodating theater, that is if you haven't already! :)  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I can't possibly give this place more than 1 star. The food I ordered took forever to be served and when I finally did get it, it was cold.  They served my husbands drink and totally forgot mine. I had to remind them for a simple sparkling water. Never mind that the sparkling water was absolutely disgusting.   The website totally over exaggerated the theater. The seats do not recline and the trays on the seats remind me of elementary school desks. The sound quality wasnt that great either, I really didn't hear surround sound, seemed like all the sound was coming from the screen."}
{"text":"So happy that groupon helped me discover the SMG!  As a previous fan of farrelli's, I was so sad our go-to date night place went out of business, but I am happy again thanks to discovering we have a new go-to place for a cheap dinner and a movie night.  For $5 each the Hubs and I got to see a movie and get a drink... what a deal!  We used to go to this theater when we were in high school... it was the cool place then, but over the years it's become run down and old.  Now that SMG has come in to revitalize it, the place is better than ever.  Loved the modern look and feel.  The bar look inviting, but we choose to just sit and wait till we were called back to our theater, which I found a little odd, but didn't mind.  Once we went back, we picked a seat.  The office type chairs were a little weird, but they were comfortable so I didn't mind.  I liked the set up better than farrelli's because the stadium seating view was much better.  The menu had a lot of choices, mostly bar type food, but it was inexpensive and offered lots of options.  We saw 21 Jump Street and had popcorn and drinks.  The service was awesome... very attentive and prompt.  All in all, I can say we will be back again for sure.  We had a great overall experience and would highly recommend it.  In fact, we've already purchased two more groupons, which I think it an awesome deal to say the least!"}
{"text":"What a perfect place to combine Dinner and a Movie in one location!! There's a BAR right as you walk in after purchasing your tickets. The theater seats are comfortable but probably only fit half as many as an AMC theater since there are moveable table tops that take up more space.  You can order food at the press of a red button and a server will come and take your order. Word of advice: order early because once the movie starts, it's a little distracting to place an order during the movie.  Food prices are similar to any outside restaurant... burgers or pizza around $10-12. And you can order beer or any cocktail too!! There are some weekday specials like all you can pizza on Wednesday.    Bathrooms are super modern & clean as well!   Will be back."}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice, liked that we could have a drink at the bar before our movie started.   Place was fairly empty on a Friday evening.  Prices were fair, food was priced reasonably.  However, the food was awfully greasy.  Like....REALLY greasy.  Wouldn't go back for the food.  Overall experience was decent...would've rather had my popcorn and soda though."}
{"text":"Ummmm....when you hear them touting dinner/movie concept you certainly don't expect to sit in an office desk chair up against a formica countertop!!!  Yes, the \"general admission\" seats are NOT WORTH IT...not even on the $5 Groupon!  And to be perfectly honest, their \"reserved seating\" is nice, but there are better places in Scottsdale.  I will say that the food was delish, and service top notch...but honestly,  I'd rather watch and older movie on my own couch!"}
{"text":"We live super close to SMG and we love This Place because it's very convenient and inexpensive.  Cons: cheap seats, broken lights and a very,  very limited selection of movies.  Pros: Good food,  quick and easy to order service,  cheap tickets thru Groupon - except weekends, parking might be challenging at times."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 stars. No reclining seats. The food is...decent. All meals about 10 dollars, my bf says it's never filling but I get a gluten free burger and am okay. Be careful what you do get if this is your main meal- the wings are a tiny portion. I think it's like 6 Wings?   They could probably change up the menu from time to time. They rarely have any good specials.    This is a good option for a movie place though. Still better than a regular movie place :)"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed about the food. I can still smell the fried onion rings and the chicken tenders... and I have that oily taste in my mouth. I prefer better AMC with their recliners and to go eat dinner after the movie...and if u want dinner and movie, I liked ipic's food much better"}
{"text":"Great for a date night. Good atmosphere.  Food was okay, kitchen was slow but I went on a Friday night. Love to be able to get a drink during a movie. Daily specials and movie specials would make it a good lunch spot to take the kids during summer vacation."}
{"text":"I will probably never return to Studio Movie Grill. The food was average and overpriced and the chairs were extremely uncomfortable. Unfortunately we purchased seats that were literal office chairs and not cinema seats. It was incredibly difficult to sit through a 2 hour movie in a rolling chair that didn't have any lean to it, but I'm the type of person that likes to recline with feet up. It was also Antarctica in the theater which added to the discomfort. After the movie was over I went to the restroom and was incredibly disappointed by the fact that there was no toilet paper in my stall, limited toilet paper in the rest of the stalls, one working sink and only one soap dispenser with soap in it. It's obvious that it had not been checked or cleaned recently. If you want a dinner/movie experience, I would suggest the iPic, AMC or Harkins 100x over Studio Movie Grill."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday.. Great place. Theater seemed very clean, chairs were comfortable and service was pretty good. I was expecting more as in seating but I think it was just fine. Thought it was great to be able to order food and press a button if I needed anything. We unfortunately didn't eat real food but we got their fudge cake, popcorn and strawberry lemonade. Everything was great. Popcorn was nice and warm and was served with butter on the side.. yum!! Totally recommend this place!!! The staff was very friendly the whole time, including when we walked out of the theatre! :)"}
{"text":"The hubby and I took our daughter here on her 14th Birthday just last week for a matinee during the week and we were so LUCKY to have the entire theater to ourselves so we could laugh, chat, share food and allow my daughter to ask questions during the movie (otherwise that's a NO NO because we do not like when people are talking during the movie so we wouldn't do this either). My daughter LOVED her food she had Buffalo chicken tenders and fries , I had an AWESOME Asian and Wonton Salad with Ginger dressing and my hubby had Quesadila's with sweet potato fries. Our movie was Awesome we say Oz in 2D wasn't sure what 2D was but basically we didn't need any glasses. The push for service button is right on time and the service was punctuale and very friendly as well. We will be back when we have out of town guest as we just relocated to Charlotte, NC from Chicago and would like to introuduce some people to Studio Movie Grill while they are in town visiting.  We also want to check out the lobby bar this summer as it wasn't open when we were exiting our matinee."}
{"text":"Need to institute a no talking policy and enforce it. Piece of blah blah blah youngsters don't understand being quiet in a movie. When children misbehave, gotta discipline."}
{"text":"First off, we could not find the theater as we were dirving all over that shopping center looking for it. We planned to be a half hour early so we could get good seats, but by the time we found it and parked, got tickets, we ended up in the front row.  The seats are not as comfy as other theaters and do not recline much.   Our order of popcorn, drinks, and cookies were taken shortly after we arrived, and asked for butter for the opocorn. We had the snacks and drinks delivered before the movie started, but noticed they had not given any butter. I pressed the service button, but did not have a server come to me for a good 15 minutes.  After we asked for buetter, it was another 20-minutes and pressed the service button again. After a few more minutes, a server came and we asked for butter again.  With 45 minutes left in the movie, butter was brought over along with the check and we asked for drink refills. They never came back. The cookies were very good, and once we got the butter, the popcorn was nicely popped, with big kernels, although a little salty. While there are some perks to having food served to you at your seat, it can be distracting as we were worried about the service more than the movie itself.  I may give it another chance, or just go back to getting my own food, and focus on the movie."}
{"text":"I have been to this theatre quite a few times. Tonight we decided to go for a movie and I was again disappointed by the lack of cleanliness in the room. Sticky tables, ketchup or sauces not properly wiped off. The drink was ok, the popcorn was definitely small and not warm enough. Studio movie grill is not my theatre of choice for those reason and the seats ( leather office chairs) are not comfy enough for a theatre setting. (especially compared to the chairs from AMC at desert ridge). 2 stars go for the concept of eating and drinking during the movie."}
{"text":"This was our first time visit.  I guess the best thing to do is come early to eat your dinner ... or order something that's more conducive to eating in the dark.  Both my husband and I ordered a salad.  Although they were really good salads, it was kind of inconvenient to eat in the dark!    I love the concept though and the service there was amazing.  We were greeted at every step of the process from entering, to getting the tickets, to entering the theatre, someone always said hi to us.  It was refreshing to get such nice service so thank you for that SMG!  So next time we come here we will definitely have to get something that's easier to eat in the dark!  Other than that, our experience here was great."}
{"text":"I've only been to Studio Movie Grill once, and it was after I bought MoviePass.  All I knew going in was that this was the closest place to my apartment in Noda so I had no preconceived notions about it at all. When we got inside the theater, it was super easy to get confirmed with our MoviePass tickets, and we headed upstairs to the theaters.  We weren't exactly sure where to go to get popcorn or drinks, but we passed a bar heading to the theaters and thought THAT was pretty cool. Who wouldn't want to get a little sloshed before seeing a movie?  After showing our ticket to the appropriate person, we were given a menu and directed to the correct theater. I didn't even know that SMG was one of those theaters that let you order food and drinks and stuff so THAT was a surprise.   They had a pretty good deal going of an appetizer and 2 entrees for $25 so my girlfriend and I did that. We got the pretzels with the queso - delicious - and both got the chicken tenders and fries. I was expecting a big ole plate of MEH on the tenders and fries but I thought both were actually really good.  I'm not exactly sure what other experiences other patrons have had, but I thought the serving staff did a good job of not making noise, not being distracting, and not getting in the way during the movie when fielding requests, getting drinks and food, and cleaning up the occasional broken glass.  All in all, I thought this was a really fun experience and definitely a nice change of pace for my movie-going experience. It had the \"fun night out\" vibe to it. I don't think I'll want to come here every time I go see a movie just because it's sort of a process, but we'll definitely be back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Usually have a good experience here, but tonight was terrible. The service was not as good as usual. They brought us the wrong food in the beginning. Then when our food came it was not good at all - first we ordered pizza & burger w fries and they were nasty so we ordered pretzel bites because we remembered them being good, but those came out bad as well. Not sure if they've changed a lot but I would not want to go back after tonight."}
{"text":"Great place. Seats are comfortable and spaced out, food is very good (it is not amazing but definitely better than the usual popcorn and the service is exceptional. We will be going again!"}
{"text":"Wow this theatre is awesome! Right when you walk into the room you can tell the seats are gonna be amazingly comfortable. The room was very quaint so there werent too many people. I ordered a spicy black bean burger that was soooo good! You have to see a movie here you wont regret it. Also i used a Groupon and i heard they have alot so stay on the lookout for that."}
{"text":"What a deal on Groupon ... $6 (used to be $5, but still) for a primetime movie ticket and a soda.  I plan on coming back here time and time again.  Great, comfortable seats, and good food, too.  What a cool luxury to be able to order food from your seat.  The only improvements they could make are to have the servers down lower when they come in the middle of the movie, and to make the lights a little less bright so they aren't distracting during the movie."}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is a serious thumbs DOWN!!!  The seats are ridiculously uncomfortable and if you get stuck in the \"rolling office chairs\" you might as well leave!  Sitting in those to watch a movie for 2 hours is torture!!!  I was excited walking in because the lobby area is nice BUT then we went into one of the theaters and I was appalled....you might as well show a movie in your office conference room...BOOOOO!  Never never never again."}
{"text":"I LOVE Studio Movie Grill. I love it when my mom feels a something crawling on her leg and cant figure out what it is. I love it when a giant cockroach proceeds to crawl up the wall next to us in the middle of our movie. I love it when my mother goes to management and they literally tell her \"I don't believe that, they run from people\" and \"In Mexico, at my brother's house, we turn the light on and the cockroaches scatter\" (yes, that just happened) and then make her sit outside when there's 15 minutes left of the movie if she wants a refund for her meal. I love going out to treat my family for a movie and a meal only to be interrupted by a giant roach, and then be publicly humiliated and spoken to as if I'm a scum bag who's just trying to get a free ticket. Additionally, I love the fact that we (used to be) frequent regulars at this establishment. You can bet our next stop WILL be the corporate office - thank you Anthony (manager) for the gracious suggestion. I have worked in restaurants for 10 years and \"It's raining outside\" is never an excuse for a cockroach crawling on a person during dinner. On another note, we \"used to\" come here semi often for the novelty, but the service has always been very slow and we often get waiters who are rude and if you ask for anything extra at all (one side of ranch during a movie, no refills) they act as if you just insulted their ancestors, then take forever to return. Go at your own risk.  Update: Corporate did give us a $50 dollar credit. A little disappointed, would have liked to have gotten a refund for the terrible experience, but will move from one star to two."}
{"text":"The movies are a typical price and the seating is nice, but do not go there for food. For the price you pay, you are better off visiting any other restaurant in Epicentre. It's funny, the opening video roll talks about how the quality of food is superior and makes you excited you may have a great meal. We ordered a 2 for $25 deal which seems like a good deal until you get the food. The 1/2 order of chicken nachos may not have even had chicken. We couldn't find it! It was just chips and lettuce. I'd hate to see a full order after knowing the 1/2 order size. I ordered the chicken fajita quesadilla which was okay, but not very warm. My boyfriend reported he's had better burgers at Wendy's and his fries were cold. I noticed that people who ordered after us received their food before us. The staff replaced the fries no problem, and they were hot, except they charged me for a side of fries at the end of the movie. When I explained, they took it off no problem. The staff was really nice and they did a great job. Just stinks they have to serve terrible food! That being said, I would probably go back for another movie if I had a Groupon to buy again, but stick with a soda and popcorn. For as rare as I go to the movies, I would most likely go to a regular movie theater next time."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is actually really good and they serve you alcohol while watching a movie! All you have to do is press a red button and bam service! Prices are really good compared to Ipic and even Harkins. This is the only place I go to catch a movie."}
{"text":"Book club and I purchased movie tickets on Groupon to see Girls Trip on a Wednesday nite. Sadly we weren't able to see the movie but have until 10/25 to redeem the tickets. Staff validated our parking, understand it wasn't their fault we purchased tickets but movie was sold out. Customer service wasn't that great however. Entrance was a little dark. Will extend review once a movie is worth going to see. Movie tix was $5 with Groupon however."}
{"text":"Loved this theater. It is really far to get to from my house but I will go back. The staff was AWESOME! The place was really clean and the seats were comfortable. I didn't order any food because we had just come from dinner. But we want to try the food next time. Thanks for the comfortable movie watching experience."}
{"text":"Forgot to review this place before. Been here multiple times (including just now to see Skyfall) with the never ending $5 Groupon. Basically you get a soda or iced tea + a ticket for $5. It's normally $7-$10 for a ticket and $3 for a soda so it's not a bad deal.  You can't buy your ticket online w/the Groupon, but the theater has recently switched to 100% reserved seating. You can check if the theater is full or not before you leave home by selecting a movie time on their website then getting to the reserved seating page and it'll show you how many seats have been purchased.  The food they serve is mostly stuff you can eat with your fingers. The prices seem high, but the portions are kinda big. Like none of it seems intended for one person to eat alone. The food itself is not really bad but not like mind numbingly good either. I've never had anything soggy or gross like some other reviewers had, and I've even been there for midnight showings.  So, the negatives.  With the new big releases, sometimes they take like a billion years to clean the theater out before the next showing. This is \"normal\" at other theaters, yes, but at other theaters you have your snacks before you walk in the door. Here, it means you can't sit down and order something before the lights go out, which is often inconvenient for the other patrons. The servers try to be quiet, but it doesn't always work out that way. Also, like other reviews have noted, the office chairs suck, and the LED service lights can be annoying.  tl;dr = Buy a few Groupons, sit in the love seats."}
{"text":"There are three movie/dinner places that I've gone to in the valley - Studio Movie Grill, Roadhouse Cinemas, and Alamo Drafthouse. I'll try to rate them by category.  PRICE (adults): SMG: $10, but you can find Groupons RH: $10 AL: $10.50, but more on weekend  SEATING: SMG: Flip up armrests but rows alternate between countertop and swing-in table. IMHO,  you want the chairs with the swing in tables. RH: By far the best. How can you beat a leather lazyboy recliner? There is also a little light that is kind of over your shoulder that is welcome so you aren't waiting to eat during bright scenes. Lol. AL: Seating is leather but is otherwise normal theater seating with flip up armrests.  FOOD: SMG: Good food and drink. RH: Good food and drink. AL: I think Alamo has the most variety of food by quite a bit. Many people are quite fond of the bottomless real-butter popcorn.  ORDERING: SMG: Press a button and it lights up. It alerts staff to tend to you. Seems to work very well and is my favorite of the three. RH: Staff just comes by every once in a while and checks on you. I don't remember any ordering mechanism. AL: You write what you want on a piece of paper and if a server sees the paper sticking up they come grab it and put your order in. I like the alternatives.  THEATER QUALITY: SMG: As it is the oldest of the three it shows its age. I was in one theater and it had a pole in front of one of the seats. Wtf? Had stadium seating. RH: I feel like the theater was the best sound and picture but this is pretty subjective and may be influenced by the nice seats. Lol. Had the lowest stadium seating grade but still plenty to not stare at someone in front of you. Overall smallest amount of seating.   AL: good to average. Had stadium seating.  I think this is the overall feeling: If you're after price,  then go to SMG If you're after good/variety of food, then go to AL. If you're after most comfortable seating or best picture then go to RH."}
{"text":"So disappointed on Starwars premier night. My wife and I bought our tickets months ago when they first went on sale so we've been looking forward to this for a while and what better way then to have delicious food and drinks during the movie. We arrived hungry and looking forward to the experience. However, after figuring out what to eat, and pushing our red button, our server arrives and tells us the kitchen was broken and they can't cook any hot food. What? Only popcorn, deserts, or cold salad. So we had to eat popcorn for dinner.  So disappointed ..."}
{"text":"I wish I could disagree with the folks who already reviewed this place, but I don't have too much to add. Ben G is right: Go for the movie (and drinks), not for food.  I actually like the new seating arrangement and appreciate that the service / food comes to me. I never liked ordering at the counter and having to fetch the food in the middle of the meal. You do in fact get used to servers scuttling around like cockroaches in the middle of the movie.  It sounds like they have the service part worked out for the most part or will soon (we had very quick response though a friend the next week didn't).  I thought that maybe they were working out the kinks in the kitchen, by the time we visited after the changeover but I think maybe they just have a bad menu / recipes. The burger was mega-burned. I understand the whole department of health must not serve undercooked beef if you don't grind onsite rule, but this lacked any moisture. Take a lesson from Five Guys or Burger Company, kids.  I did appreciate the brioche bun and toppings (we got the BBQ sauce one). I would not reorder without them changing the recipe and people gushing about it. The quesadilla was OK but unremarkable and very bland.  I didn't know what Lyndsay meant about thin chips, but they really are quite wimpy and unsatisfying. The strawberry (mango?) margarita was supposed to come frozen and it came on the rocks which was OK but it was the sweetest drink I've ever had, which was not so good.    Perhaps we try the coconut chicken tenders next time with our flick and stick with wine/beer."}
{"text":"A luxurious movie going experience! We were in the area and needed to waste a few hours before an event, so we grabbed the groupon ($5/movie) and went inside. The lobby is HUGE and you aren't bombarded with the smell of popcorn upon arrival (pro or con? I'm not sure...).   You choose your seats, so I can see how getting their late, or going to a newer movie might lead to some anxiety of not getting the seat you want. You can reserve online ahead of time.   The menus were nice - lots of options. I was most impressed with the daily specials (ie. Wed/Sun $10 all you can eat pizza - say what!?). Milkshakes and 2 for $25 meals were also appealing!  Lost a star for the chairs being so darn uncomfortable and the fact that you have to smell whatever your neighbor ordered for dinner through the entire movie (sorry, I'd rather just smell popcorn, at least I know what I'm getting). Overall I'd highly recommend if you want a unique date night idea or if you want to enjoy dinner and a movie simultaneously."}
{"text":"Service is horrible, I came in and drinks were all over. Dropped a beer by new sneaks, ridiculous, I would never get this service in Dallas. This is beyond unacceptable, SMG is one of my favorite places back home. If you're here for a movie you might be ok with this adequate service but if you would like to enjoy food with your movie, DO NOT BRING YOUR BUSINESS HERE. I feel disrespected and I waited 1 hour, for some dry ass chicken tenders. Movie ruined, night ruined, whole trip to Charlotte ruined thanks to this great SMG! Bunt sausage on my pizza!"}
{"text":"The prices are not too exorbitant for a movie theater that has seat-side service.  I have had some stale popcorn here and the food can be hit and miss, but other than that I really have no complaints.  On Sundays Studio Movie Grill has $5 glasses of house white wine and $10 all-you-can-eat, one-topping pizzas.  And the pizzas are not horrible; I am always leery of 'bottomless' food.  I had chicken nachos once and they were weak, lacking cheese and chicken with a huge pile of lettuce on top...more like a salad.  On the bright side, drinks are always kept topped up and seats are relatively comfortable; just make sure to get a table seat not a counter seat."}
{"text":"Much better than Mez and Cinnebar! Great sound and picture, food is good, employees are super friendly... and after the show you walk back out to the bar to find that it's turned into a dance club! The DJ there is awesome. Every song gets the ladies dancing. I'm coming back next weekend for sure."}
{"text":"If it was possible I would have left no stars. For having to bring my family over an hour, for what was a great experience in the past, this last experience left such a bad taste in our mouths that it's irreconcilable. Policy changes like no longer able to use Groupon or retailmenot coupons on weekends or evenings after 5pm, plus having to swipe a credit card before ordering food/drinks makes this no better than taking my children to a bar. And now placing limitations drinks that can be ordered.  The best part was when confronting the manager about the new policies I was told that it was a communication error.  The Purchased Groupons and Coupons we're getting errors on all of my devices (Computer,  tablet and phone) so having called and spoke tRetailMeNoto an actual person, I was told that Groupons and RetailMeNot couldn't be used after 5pm during the week or all day on weekends.  After paying full price the waiter swiped my credit card before placing the order then with attitude the next waitress would not allow us to order a second pitcher of beer, she would only allow us (3 adults ) to order pints each.  These are not \"Communication Errors\" these are Policy changes as each of the employees other than the manger \"Thomas\" said.  Having tried the AMC Dine In Theater which by the way is closer to home we will be glad to pass out considerable business to AMC from now on as should everyone else in the digital U.S.A."}
{"text":"When I first heard about a movie theater that served you food during the movie, I thought it would be a recipe for disaster. But after going there, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! The servers don't even get in the way and the food is so so good! The seats are so comfortable and everything is pretty close to perfect. I can't wait to go on dates here, I know this will be a great spot!"}
{"text":"I try my best to give this theater chance after chance after chance and they still manage to do something to put a bad taste in my mouth. The food service!! Every single time we go we have some type of problem with it. Last time my husband I went, we had to ask four times for someone to clean his eating area, the service was extremely slow and after my asking for water four times and never receiving it, I had to finally walk to the kitchen area myself where there were about 8 waters sitting on a counter and about four servers standing there so I got my water and request a wet towel or something to clean my husbands table. They were finally nice enough to send someone to finally clean it long after his food had already arrived."}
{"text":"This our family's go-to movie place.  We get the Groupons which is a great deal.   The service is good.  It's not the best because sometimes they forget little things like an extra side dip or water, but whatever.  The main meals are better than traditional movie theater fare, but nothing spectacular.  I just love the idea of eating a meal or having a drink or dessert while watching a movie in a decent comfortable chair. The seats of both types are comfortable.   It's always busy when we go at night."}
{"text":"DONT DO IT!!! I like the previous reviews that wrote, \"go big (IPic) or go home (Harkins). Don't settle for seconds (Studio Movie Grill)!\"   I took my fiancé out for a late night movie, outta the blue. Went to smg's website cause I figure reserved seating would be best just in case. We showed early and thought it was ridiculous that we couldn't just enter the movie, instead had to be corralled in a line even though we had reserved seats. I get it for general admin, but couldn't you devise a better way... Like signing up numbers for entrance when tickets are purchased, airport style, and call out groups to enter? Standing in line for a movie... Even with 5 people total in one line is STUPID. Assign me a number according to when I purchased the ticket, and let me lounge at the bar until you call my number sounds way better.   We finally got to sit 20 mins before previews. Staff welcomed us... we were first patrons to enter. Seemed warm and friendly, showing us to our seats. I figured alright, good start. DIDN'T LAST LONG! From the time that we sat, until the lights went off for the previews, NO ONE CAME AND TOOK OUR ORDER, sh$@t for that matter nobody even came and said hi, welcome! I sat next to a group of 5... The girl next to me, all the way down to the first of her party, was greeted and ordered. We sat, looked, and not even a hello from that waitress. Okay, I figure maybe they do it restaurant style and assign different servers to different sections, I waited. Girl next to me got served with food and drinks. Me and company? NADA. I looked at the waitress at least 3 times and made eye contact. Anything? Nope!   I'm not trying to be a b&$@* and snotty, but if I'm paying $5 bucks extra online to get reserved seatings, I expect service first before general admin like the girl next to me.   Fiancé and I said fine. Let's see how long it takes... Lights dim, movie starts... Menus are still right in front of us (prime indicator in dining settings that we haven't been served)... NOTHING, still.   We enjoyed the movie, and went out afterwards to speak to a manager. NO SERVICE OFFERED THE ENTIRE TIME. We got the server in charge of the theater, and the manager. Told them about our experience. Sever was nice enough to admit that he told his group to go in, take orders, and bust food ASAP so they can leave for the night. He apologized if that might have resorted to us being neglected. Manager, skates through apologies and keeps harping on the fact that if we want service, red light should be pushed. REALLY?!?!?! Let me see if my logic is correct... When I enter a movie theater, 20 mins early, with the lights still on and bright, and general admin never having pushed their red lights but still get service, I still have I show you I need service??? So...when you finally flash the \"please push button for service,\" right before lights dim, that also applies to the period of lights being on 20 mins before??? Me being there and looking at you while I can still see my menu, doesn't dictate a need for service? any common sense kick in to stop by and take orders while lights are still on... even just to acknowledge someone's presence and say hello... isn't feasible because I haven't pushed your darling red button??!?!?!   Sad how I respected the server more than the manager. Manager offers us some free passes... NO THANKS!! Next time, if I wanted extra service for a little extra $$, i'll go somewhere that delivers!!!!!   IPic all the way. I don't have to see servers ducking in and out of my movie. At least IPic is smart enough to request patrons to show up 20 mins early to place an order (in the light) instead of coming over and ducking in and out to ask for my order during the movie, loud enough that the whole theater can hear, and in the dark as I do the shuffle around the light behind me just to see my menu. By the way, IPic? Has pens with lights so if you came late, can still see your menu.  AND they duck behind you, no obstruction to your view or those behind you on stadium seating.   First, and last time. Pity, I thought they had a good concept and atmosphere seemed a lot more casual then IPic. BUT service should be on par all around regardless of atmosphere... I freaking paid extra for reserved, can't I get some normal service, if not a little extra treatment???"}
{"text":"Overall Studio Movie Grill has been an okay experience for me. An Applebee's-like menu that isn't as garbage, plus the office chair/counter setup seemed odd with this shift towards all-recliner theatres. But it's proximity to other great businesses plus its ability to MoviePass online makes this a great theatre for me.  From a movie standpoint the theatres aren't bad. There aren't as many, which means they'll be less showtimes than say AMC or Harkins. However, the picture and sound quality doesn't lose to either. Additionally, I'm starting to grow a shift to seeing more movies here that aren't just guaranteed box office smashes. Because when critical or fan reception is mixed, you still want a theatre that's relatively full for the sake of camaraderie. I can speak for the recent Justice League, which was fun to jeer or cheer with a full crowd. By comparison, AMCs with their larger theatres were over half empty.  Biggest perk for me is MoviePass. It's been in the news recently - monthly subscription for a 2D movie once a day the entire year. It works at AMCs and Cinemarks in the Valley, but what SMG has over them is a secured deal for e-ticket rights. When pretty much every advanced screening nowadays has reserved seating, buying tickets at the office is becoming a hassle. Here, you can even leave your MoviePass card at home and just redeem your code there!  Given how it's so close to me, and Desert Ridge tickets are more often in the teens for pricing, Studio Movie Grill is quickly becoming a contender for my work and student friends."}
{"text":"We've gone to this location twice before. This time it was pathetic! The young woman who took our tickets mumbled. I asked her to repeat what she said. She looked down and mumbled, \"something, something, seven, something\". Our server didn't show up until we had been there for at least fifteen minutes. The theater wasn't even half full at that point. The drinks came out piece meal over the following twenty minutes. Our daughter's milkshake finally showed up after 30 minutes. Mostly melted. All four meals were stone cold. The only time the sever came promptly was to bring the check. Next time we'll save the hassle and go out to dinner before attending a convenient Harkins cinema."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. One request! Update your seating. All other theaters have reclining seats. The office chair space you have should be able to easily be replaced along with other seating. Every time I go this place is packed the seating should be a renovation I hope is in the works. Even if you don't update it I'm still gonna go haha!"}
{"text":"So disappointing. I had heard good things about going here, but upon entering the theatre, I noticed every other row was office chairs. I spend my whole week in an office chair, why the fuck would I want to go to a movie and sit in one for 2 plus hours? Cheap as fuck."}
{"text":"We went to Studio Movie Grill over the weekend.    The staff was very friendly and cheerful.   The food was good (Lettuce Wraps, Sweet Potato Fries, Burger).  The only negative experienced was the movie times on site did not match the internet. Rather than the movie I wanted to see having the posted showtime the SMG management had changed the times.  Apparently the local SMG management only controls their voice system for movie times, not the internet.  Either I had to wait until the movie's new showing time or see something different.  Considering the dearth of good movies out this was a suboptimal choice.     So other than not being able to see the movie we wanted as advertised the trip out was acceptable."}
{"text":"The theaters are nice and everything the food is the thing that knocked off stars for me.  I got the macaroni and cheese and it was a plate of garbage.  Presentation wise it looked good,  taste wise it was disgusting.  At first taste I thought it was bland but then you get a slight taste and it doesnt even taste like cheese or really i could figure out.  Just overall not good food, although whats not bad  is just pay for a movie ticket for 4 hrs of epicenter validation even if you dont go to the movie."}
{"text":"I'm really digging the new setup for Studio Movie Grill! At SMG you can now order right from your seat while watching your movie and with great service to boot. It is now a full movie AND dining experience. I ordered one of the flatbread pizzas (which was just OK) but I would go back in a heartbeat with a friend to catch a movie and a bite and try other menu items. All of the other food that I saw others order looked very delicious. If you live near uptown, this is such an easy way to knock out dinner, drinks and a movie all in one fell swoop. They also validate parking!"}
{"text":"Went to a movie on Xmas. Decided to see Unbroken at Studio Movie grill in Scottsdale. Movie was great but it is the last time I will ever go back to SMG. We were among the first in the theater and were almost immediately attended to by a server who took our drink order. Twenty minutes later and after lighting all three flashers (there were five of us) we finally got a server to take our order and oh, by the way, where's the water we ordered? After 40 minutes and queries to two other servers, we finally got our water. Must have had to dig a new well to get it. About 5minutes later our food arrived, ice cold. I had to carry the plates outside t get them attended to and actually spoke with a manager at that time. Fifteen minutes later, food arrives, grilled chicken tenders are still cold (though the fries I did not want were warm) and the flatbread was cool. Finished what we could and $82 dollars later we left at the end of the movie. I left a $12 tip because after all, it was Xmas. Spoke with another manager on our way out who seemed oblivious to what the patrons knew which was that their service was horrendous. Note to self, when we want to see a movie, for now on, we will go to a movie theater and not someplace where they cannot even prepare bar food correctly. The funny thing is that they now lead off with an advertisement that talks about how important the food and service is to them. Don't be fooled, they care only about getting your money and could not care less for the service or quality of their food. You will definitely NOT find me at SMG EVER again. Good riddance to bad rubbish."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is so popular. My back hurt from the \"lounge\" chairs. Concept is cool but provide an actual lounge chair with a footrest & a back high enough for a 5'8\" person to lean their head against. The other poor people sat in office chairs behind a counter! Not my thing."}
{"text":"Theater good,  food baaaad.  Drinks baaaad too. Not even sure of alcohol was added.  Been there a few times. .. popcorn is small and cold.  I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Nice theater. It's pretty clean. The bad, it's basically half counters with office chairs as seating. Literally. Not the comfortable theater recliners like everyone else is switching to. If you're close up you hurt your neck. Didn't love it personally. But if you really want to see a new movie that's sold out everywhere else this isn't a bad option."}
{"text":"By far the worst movie theater experience I can remember having. Poor food and service with horrible planning when it comes to getting people in and out of the theater. Do yourself a favor and drive to another theater"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a Yelp Elite event so we were fortunate enough to try many different menu offerings as well as drinks.   My favorite food that we had sampled was the coconut chicken tenders (to die for!). They also had ribs which my husband really liked, cheesecake, and a spinach mushroom bacon pizza (yum!).   For dinner I had a grilled chicken sandwich which I added swiss cheese and bacon, with the salsa and tortilla chips. My husband had a cheeseburger with fries. The chicken was very good, but I didn't really care for the chips and salsa. I thought the chips were paper thin, and I like my chips to have more substance to them. My huband's fries were very good and so was his cheeseburger. I stole a good bit of his fries.   For dessert we had the chocolate chip cookies which are served warm. I think you get four or five to an order, most of which we boxed and ate later. They were excellent!   As for the service during the cocktail hour we had I thought it was very good. The servers are fun and were definitely part of the reason we had so much fun! During the movie however, it was a little strange. We sort of had a specific waiter, but other would stop by if our light was on to see what we needed. I think it threw off the serving process that we all ordered at once. I think during a regular movie, you order when you sit down initially so that would cut down on the confusion.   Overall, I enjoyed our experience. I think the highlight was definitely the food and drinks. If you haven't had Cupcake wine, try it! It's very good. If you've been to Mez and then go to SMG, the decor hasn't changed but the mood and the experience have really improved. Good job SMG! Keep it going!"}
{"text":"I have visited SMG about 10 times over the last year.  It seems like the service has been gradually getting worse during that time.  Tonight we ordered popcorn, pizza, dessert and drinks.  The desert and pizza came 1st after 20 minutes. (It always takes about 20 minutes to get your food)  10 minutes later I press the button and a different server comes by and I say we haven't gotten our popcorn or drinks.  10 more minutes and I grab a waiter and again mention there is no popcorn or drinks. I asked him to bring it immediately and he was apoplectic and quickly returned with out refreshments.  Of course when I get the bill I have been double charged for the popcorn and drinks.  :-(  Now I have to wait inline with 5 other people whose order were also wrong.  Another issue is that the speakers were rattling during the particularly loud scenes.  This is really not acceptable for a \"upscale\" theater.   I do love picking my seat which are wide and comfortable and will probably be back but won't be buying food/drinks in the future.  I guess I will need to sneak in my refreshments.  :-)"}
{"text":"Okay...so the intention was to go and watch a movie....However, they had $3 shots at the bar...so umm...well...I'm going to have to come back and review the total SMG experience.   But the ambience and bar experience was great. The place was not too packed and has a very laid back vibe. Not to mention, its beautiful inside.   We had two very attentive bartenders helping us...we simply said we want something sweet...and they both did an outstanding job....round...after round...after round....we were very pleased! I have no clue what any of the drinks were called but they were all delicious. And for that price, how could we not want to return?!?   I really look forward to coming back for the whole movie and dining experience! So definitely expect an update...soon!"}
{"text":"Didn't have high hopes for the food or service so I wasn't too disappointed.   As a movie theatre, the seats are comfy and there is plenty of room. As a restaurant, the food is subpar and the service was questionable. I do admit I was pleasantly surprised with the prices. I purchased a groupon so my ticket was only 5 bucks, plus a $10 pizza. The pizza was pretty bad, but again, low expectations.  Makes sure you bring your parking ticket to get validated!! I forgot and was out $10. Bummer."}
{"text":"So this happened tonight. One of the waitress spilled coffee on Hubs. There was no real apology, just a oh yeah let me get some napkins. We've been really disappointed in the food quality, service and now this. We use to love visiting this movie theater but every time we have gave it a chance it's been disappointing: not to mention how filthy the floors were in the theater. Despite the coffee spill and lack of empathy. We still paid our bill and left a tip. Warning this is not the place we use to frequent often."}
{"text":"This is one of two of my favorites movie theaters. They are always polite and helpful even with a full house. The food has NEVER disappointed either of us... everything tastes fresh and the seating is comfortable-- you pick your seat ahead of time- - No fuss!! Very clean!  It feels like visiting a friends house for dinner and a movie. HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"The bartender at Studio Movie Grill at uptown Charlotte in the Epicenter informed me that she cannot accept state ids except nc state id, I'm from Oakland and my freidn is from New York, we both are in our thirties and have been served everywhere else but Studio Movie Grill.....I was shocked that I was being refused service in 2014 since I've been to North Carolina before, my friend moved here six months ago and never heard this obscure law but we walked away upset and went into the movie as it was starting.....a few minutes later the manager-Johnathan Papkin showed us a print out of the law dismissed us in a very condescending way, we disagreed with what he was saying about that they can refuse us service and he left the paper on our table and we threw it down, we didn't yell at him because we were trying to watch the movie we payed for....that was enough for him to call security, stop the movie, and escorted us out like we were criminals; the security then called the police because we at firts demanded a refund....I spoke to his manager Barrett Covin and he defended this fpoul treatment and tried to blame  us for 37 movie passes he gave to the crowd for the unnecesary disturbance they created....-Do not go there!"}
{"text":"I visit this theatre often because of convenience. However, it's not my favorite. Multiple times something has been wrong with the movie sound. The staff is always very friendly but not very quiet during the movie. The drinks take an extremely long time after you order. I've noticed no guests at the bar before walking into the movie and yet the drinks still take a while. We saw Avengers Friday May 1st and we received our food before drinks. Took more than 10 minutes to receive a straw an extra napkins. If the service changed a bit then I would rate higher."}
{"text":"I love the idea of combining dinner and a movie! The frozen hot chocolate was very good, and it was nice treat to enjoy during the movie. I probably would not eat my whole meal here, though, because you are eating in the dark and can't focus on the film. Neat concept with a very hip atmosphere, though."}
{"text":"The staff and service was good but the seats were horrible and disappointing.  Not very comfortable at all, very out dated, and as many have mentioned poorly designed.  They don't move or recline, nothing and are very small. The food seemed ok for what you are paying, if you're going to to eat there you're going to be paying a good amount so I'd rather go to a nice dinner at a nice restaurant. Over all it wasn't horrible but the seats make me wanna just go to the regular movie theater."}
{"text":"Went for a late afternoon matinee. The theatre is kind of small so if your looking to sit far away from people, you better hope nobody shows up for your movie. The sound system is great and that is a plus in drowning out people trying to figure out what to order halfway through the flick. You should sat as far as you can from the entrance near the other side of the wall so the servers don't disturb you 100% of the time. I didn't use the button because if you get into the movie early, they will just come over and take your order. I got a draft beer for about 5 bucks and change after tax and I sat in the non office chair seats. Nobody sat in those, so I'm not sure why they are still there. Still old fashioned and want dinner and a movie, but will try some coconut fingers next time at least for the novelty factor."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to see a movie! Love love love! Good food, drinks of all kinds and we love the chair options. We prefer to sit in a regular chair verses a theater seat, again just nice to have options."}
{"text":"Ok - so I had high hopes for this place. Sounded cool and looked good online. I've become a fan of the higher end theaters so thought this would be similar - WRONG!  I like the idea of reserved seating - no need to rush to get your seats - that's a plus and they offer that. They also offer food service while in the theater, I'll get to that in a bit.   Seating - the theater was basically like a lecture hall when i was in college. Every other row had a table that stretched the full length of the isle and rather than comfy movie seats or standard movie seats - office chairs (and showing wear and tear on the arms). They do rock (not the same as recline mind you) but was not a comfortable movie going experience. I did not like that at all.   Food Service - it was ok. Service seemed to be decent by not exceptional by any stretch. Again, was expecting a bit of a higher experience based on other high end theaters, but the food was served on some kind of plastic chinette stuff - again, just off putting. My friend had the chocolate sundae and thought it was just ok. The menu did have some interesting items, including apple & peanut butter - love it! Simple food is appreciated at times.   Booking - I booked my tickets via Fandango iphone App - my preference. The theater layout when picking seats did not at all reflect the auditorium / table placement issues I described. I spoke with the manager who advised they just started working with Fandango a few days ago and I should have booked on their website, they do a better job of describing the seats so you know you are sitting in a classroom to watch your movies. I really wasn't expecting much, but the answer of book it a different way / not our fault (my words but how I felt after our discussion) left a sour taste in my mouth.   Conclusion - the seating alone will prevent me from returning and didn't really appreciate the interaction / outcome of speaking with the manager.   I will continue to go to iPic, pay over double the price for the experience I appreciate - happy movie going all!"}
{"text":"This is my frst time here.and yes I am quite pleased coz you get that what you paid for.though I did not like the food that much.I went there with friends and ordered that 2 for 25 meal.I did not like the chicken florantine pizza at all.the service was impressive. And yes I will come again here to see some kind of movies.."}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is a great concept.. It's dinner and a movie in one. Which is why my large family always comes here. Not to mention, always $6 groupons! The 10 people in my family can see a movie for $60 instead of $100 at Harkins or AMC.  The food is pretty good. I usually stick with the basic nachos, chicken strips, etc. but I'm sure the rest is good!  The only complaints that I have, is that I feel like it takes forever to get a refill on a drink. Food is hit or miss depending on how busy it is. One time it took 30 min for me to get popcorn and then 10 min to get grilled chicken strips. Like I said.. Hit or miss.  A lot of people don't like the servers walking through the isles constantly, but once you're actually engaged in the movie, you don't even notice. (I've also never had an isle seat where they walk up and down though.. That may be a distraction for some people).  The employees could work a little but more on their customer service.. I mean it's whatever since I'm there to watch a movie. But when you sound rude and miserable asking \"who had the nachos?\" You should probably get a new job. Something you enjoy!  And last, always go for the row with the lounge chairs and swivel table.. Much better than the office chairs in the other rows!"}
{"text":"I love this place for the comfort of the theater, prices, and popcorn/drinks! I've been here many times and it never disappoints. The service is lovely and the mints that are given upon exiting the theater are such a nice touch.   The chairs are really comfortable and there really isn't a bad seat in the house. The servers come promptly to your chair whenever you hit the red service button. I like that they take your credit card at the beginning so you don't have to fumble through your wallet later in the movie.  We usually just get drinks and popcorn, of which both our generous portions, reasonably priced, and delicious. Today we ate dinner here and between the kids pizza (my son), chicken salad (me), and margarita flatbread (my mom), our food was just OK. The veggies on my salad were crisp and fresh, but there weren't many veggies besides the greens that came with it. Unfortunately too, the chicken was very dry and tough, I couldn't even cut some pieces with my knife and fork. I had to tear into those with my teeth, like a wolf :-)  The consensus of our party is that we will continue to come here for the movie, drinks, and popcorn but enjoy lunch/dinner either before or afterwards.  Tip: if you order a large popcorn, there is one free refill!"}
{"text":"Not a large selection of movies, and service fluctuates from decent to dismal! The food is comfortable, and it's nice to be able to grab a bite, more then popcorn! Great concept, not always executed to the best of their abilities . If you park in the epicenter,  this place will validate!!"}
{"text":"I thought it was a wonderful experience. I received better service than I have at at any Applebee's, chilis, or Friday's. The food is chilis meets movie theater. But hey it was way better than I expected. I expected crappy old hotdogs and candy at $30- just like movie theater prices. Instead I got Applebee's quality food with service better than anyway else. My friend and I both got our drinks  refilled at twice without even asking. Out food came out within less than 10 minutes, cooked perfectly- and on a Friday night! The food was good. They offered a $25 deal for one app, and two entrees. I'd rather come here than get ripped off by two transactions for dinner and a movie anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great place to see a movie. Big comfortable chairs, assigned seating, and service at your seat. They offer a full bar, and an assortment of food from full meals to your typical movie theater fare.   It's like your living room with a staff to take care if you."}
{"text":"I have been to this studio movie grill multiple times, and it's really a hit or a miss. But tonight my experience there was the worst I have ever experienced- to the point of I will probably never return. I arrived at 10:15 for a 10:30 movie, and they told us we couldn't be seated in the theater yet, so we waited in the lobby. At 10:35 an employee came out to let us know they had forgotten we were there and we could be seated in the theater now, but don't worry because the movie hadn't started yet. We were the only ones in the theater which I thought would be cool and we would get served quickly since they weren't busy!   We attempted to order the Tex mix trio- to which the employee told us that it no longer came with guacamole because of budget cuts they couldn't afford to buy it. So we asked if it was the same price still, and she said yes and they'll bring two sides of queso instead. We decided not to buy it because paying the same price to not get one of the sides (the one that makes the price so high because of avocados) was not worth it.   So we tried to order onion rings-- but they were out.  So we rooted to our third and final option: lodes potato skins.   Our party of three ordered one order of potato skins and two brownie sundaes. About 20 minutes after we ordered the potato skins came out. They were fantastic.  About 20 more minutes go by and still the sundaes didn't show up so I pushed my button to alert a server we needed them, we were going to ask if the sundaes were coming out soon-- however nobody came to theater to check on us. After about 15-20 minutes I got frustrated and eventually turned off the button.   An hour and a half into the movie they bring the check to us as if we had gotten all of our food. To which we told them we never received 2/3rds of our food and felt we shouldn't have to pay, the waitress caught the biggest attitude I have ever seen, and when she was speaking to my friend and I attempted to comment- she cut me off and exclaimed that she wasn't speaking to me so how dare I interrupt! How rude of someone who works in a customer service position...  At this point they not only didn't bring our food but we're ruining our experience because they were arguing with us and we were missing the movie.  I told them that they needed to come discuss this with us after the movie was over because we paid to see this movie and they were ruining the entire experience.  5 minutes later they attempted to bring us the brownie sundaes but seeing as there was only 15 minutes left of the movie we denied them. It DOES NOT take an hour and a half+ to scoop ice cream especially when we were the only ones in the theater.  We were not apologized to for our awful experience nor were we able to speak to a manager when we asked. When we left the theater there were no employees to be found.  This experience was completely awful and the company's service was so unacceptable!  This was my last night visiting with my mother in town and studio movie grill ruined the night for us. The LEAST and I mean LEAST they could do was apologize and refund the movie tickets since we missed a big chunk of the middle of the movie arguing with them.   Update: I received a phone call from the owner for manager of this location (I forget what he said his title was) who apologized personally and is working hard to correct the horrible situation that took place. I'll be changing my rating from 1 star to 2 for the time being, and will update again based on how my next visit there is."}
{"text":"I had the worst customer experience at a theatre or restaurant ever at this Studio Movie Grill.  The servers and manager were very rude.  NEVER GO HERE!!!  After getting charged $7 for soda I requested the manager kindly take 1 soda off my charge because that is an outrageous price for two sodas.  He refused.  I said I have been to Studio Movie Grill 25-30 times and was aghast at the ridiculous price of their soda and would be very happy if he helped me out.  I said if he didn't help me out I would never go to them again.  Still refused.   Let's see $45 a date twice a month for over a year....that's $1080 they are losing just over a year instead of comping me $3.50 for a soda I would have never ordered if I knew that's how much it was.  Soda costs them like 15 cents and they decided to be rude to me and not want my business ever again.  Request granted.  Guess I will be going to the Esplanade, it is a much better experience."}
{"text":"Seats aren't comfy and food is mediocre. Trays are small as well. Not my favorite dine in movie theater."}
{"text":"This is my husband and I's favorite place to go to the movies. The seats are comfortable and the all-in-one experience is well worth it. They have good food and one of the best Group-On deals for tickets at only $6 a piece.  The place has a clean look and the movie experience itself is great. Well worth that date night with your sweetheart"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the fact that I can enjoy a beer and catch a flick at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"For the longest time this theater was closed and now it has a whole new look, name and appeal!  I bought the groupon and enjoyed The Wolf  so much with the not too sweet raspberry lemonade that came with the $5 ticket/ When the groupon came on again I was right on it! The burger is big and comes with potato or sweet potato fries and it is enough for 2 people.  The service is great, the tables and chairs are comfortable and clean. The only thing that I'd like to see is a healthier style menu and chairs that recline."}
{"text":"So fun! Recliner seats & they have a groupon so you can get a movie ticket for $5. Make sure to reserve your seats early though. The food is just decent & that's why I gave it only 4 stars. They also validate parking!"}
{"text":"Never brought my change to me. Asked for a refill of my drink. Never came. Whole place is dirty. I had no idea who was actually my server. One person took my order another brought the food be fore my drink arrived. When my drink did arrive it was flat. Another server took my money and just never came back. All food is microwaved I think. My chicken pasta was luke warm. I will not go back and encourage you not to waste your money here."}
{"text":"What a beautiful facility to give terrible service in.  The bad reviews here are accurate.  It was a Nice idea in theory. But I came here for a matinee at lunchtime, waited 50 minutes into the film for my food and when it showed up it was cold and soggy.  Like actually cold.   So I sent it back, and sat through the whole movie starving and then got my crappy food 3/4 of the way through.  I ordered the catfish.  There were 3 tiny bits of fish each barely the size of a McNugget. The rest was all soggy fries and a few really greasy tiny hush puppies.    I thought I was treating myself for a relaxing way to have lunch, but in the end I had to eat in my hotel room afterward and just was angry the whole time.  Don't come to this place expecting to get any decent food service, or decent food.   The manager acted so surprised that I was angry about the situation.  I told him this is inexcusable and extremely poor service and he looked at me like I was the asshole with this look on his face like I just slapped his grandmother across the face.  I guess he expects people to smile and say, \"no problem\" when they're starving and being given terrible service.  He didnt do anything but send me back out my reheated food.  Didn't offer a discounted check or anything.  Terrible!!!!   I'm not convinced management in the southern states have the skills to deal with customers who are unhappy or disgusted by their bad service.  It's not the only place in Charlotte I was treated poorly for complaining about bad service."}
{"text":"The old Epicentre Theatre was great. The way they have this set-up now is terrible. You wait in a line to get into the theatre and sometimes it's the wrong line. Nobody explains the process and the numerous staff members mulling around had no idea.   When I tried to order spinach dip I was told it's not sold individually but they had a two dip special for $25 and even that was terrible and took way too long to get.  Go during the week maybe it will be better or drive somewhere else."}
{"text":"Worst food I've EVER had!!! I've been here twice since the \"new\" company took over and as a bouncer who used to work here back when it was Mez, I can tell you, they have really screwed the pooch on this one. The first time I went must have been right after they opened and the pizza I got was ok. Pretty big size but not all that flavorful and too hard to eat. Little did I know that compared to the pizza they serve now it would seem like the best pizza in the world! I went about a month ago and got the \"never ending\" pizza and I swear the regular one was a crappy microwavable pizza smaller than my hand and so I then tried the thin crust and it was even worse!!! The dough was raw and as limp as a noodle. Service is horrendous!!! They screw up everything and don't seem to care at all. I think the server laughed when we asked for a refill of our popcorn because he couldn't believe that we called him all the way there just for that...lol. Very strange that they haven't looked on here and tried to fix anything. This place will not be open long. Why would you make horrible food that is messy at a PRIME SPOT in the busiest part of Charlotte???? Makes no sense! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"I really liked Studio Movie Grill.  I'll just make a list of why I enjoyed my experience there :]  - The ticket and food prices are super reasonable. In San Diego, the equivalent is super pricey in comparison. - The seats are really comfy and spacious - The tray offered lots of space to place the food and drinks - It was clean - Service was super friendly and efficient - It wasn't super crowded  I really want to go again the next time I visit Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Until last month I had nothing but good things to say about this place. I mean who wouldnt like a theater where they have a menu where you can order while you watch the movie, waiters, alcholic beverages and they bring the popcorn to you! But an incident happened that has me never wanting to go there again. I was there with my girl, girl's sister and my girl's son when all of a sudden a worker comes and accuses us of having a dog with us and said that we needed to put the dog in the car. We told the guy who claimed he was the manager that he could search us and the area we are sitting in, which he did and didnt find any dog but he still insisted that we had one because a worker of his had supposedly seen one. It seems like this area is racist because we were the only ones in the theater who were not caucasian and they just simply made something up to get us out of there. They refused to give us a refund and kicked us out for something that wasnt even true. Dont waste your time at this unprofessional and potentially racist establishment. Never have i had such a horrible experience at a theater before."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, nice theater, but our waitress never dropped our check off. We waited a about ten minutes then we asked another waitress, who still didn't come back. Some couples just left without paying. My husband and I sought out a floor manager/supervisor who pronted our check and there were entrees and drinks on there that weren't ours. He was really great, took them off with no questions asked. If it wasn't for that I would have given full stars."}
{"text":"This place was fun, different and I thought the food was good.  It's a movie theater for starters so my expectations on the food weren't that high.  The burger sliders were amazing.  The parmesan french fries were also good.  Not a fan of their pizza.  Buffalo sliders were also good.  Free refills on beverages (obviously doesn't include alcoholic ones)    I loved the place and didn't mind the office chairs.  I thought they were quite comfy.  However there are two types or chairs ones that remind me of airplane chairs that have a little tray for you to eat on, and office ones that have a bench table for you to eat on.  I liked the bench better than the tray set up. I guess the point is take a look online at the chairs before picking yours, since it is assigned seating.   I will definitely be going back and will buy more groupons because going to a movie for $5 is a deal either way.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the food wasn't out of this world just standard bar food you will find at any restaurant, and they messed up our bill like 2-3 times, ha ha.  I didn't mind it all got worked out in the end, and who can blame them . . .its not like they can see in there!"}
{"text":"My mom and I went to the Scottsdale Studio Movie Grill today  March 27, 2018 to see the movie Midnight Sun. We got there in enough time to see the film on time at 1:30pm and the showtime was for 1:45pm. There was only one person at the ticket counter, and she was busy on the phone. We were waiting and she saw us there, but she was too busy on the phone to help us. I said we are going to missed the beginning of the film. So I went to the bar and he was rude as well, I ask him 3 times could he get the manager because we need to buy tickets. So finally he went and told the manager, the manager name Tom looked right at me. Then he got another person to sell us the tickets, at this point time has wasted. It is now 2pm, I ask the guy have the movie started yet? He said \"Oh no you got 20 mins of previews before the movie starts.\" Then his computer wasn't working so he told the other ticket seller to let him deal with the person on the phone and she can sell us the tickets. So she sold us the tickets and when we went inside to see the film, it was already a good 15 mins into the movie. I went back and told them we missed the beginning of our movie because of her playing on the phone. The manager Tom was very rude, he started yelling very loud at me around other people, very unprofessional saying that it's not her fault that she was on the phone and that I could of bought tickets online or at the kiosk. I explain to him this was my first time here, I didn't know they had a kiosk and I don't know how to use it. Tom was still yelling and screaming at me saying it's easy to use, just click on buy tickets. I told him that it should of been more then one person at the ticket counter. He started saying there is only 25 people in the building and thanks for telling him how to do his job. I feel he was very rude and racist. Just because I'm a young black female he felt he could yell and scream at me in front of other people, what type of manager does that? The customer is always RIGHT!!! He should be FIRED... If I would of been a white female, I'm sure his tone would of been a lot different and he would of comp me movie tickets for there mistake. The Worst experience of my LIFE. I wouldn't recommend this theater to no one. The cups are very dirty as well, the guy at the bar gave my mom a cup of ice in a dirty nasty cup. This place is not even clean, people shouldn't eat here."}
{"text":"What a fantastic addition to the Epicenter!    What they've done oh-so-right: + Attentive, passionate staff + VIP atmosphere.  Makes you want to dress up for the movies! + Beautiful lounge area to sip on cocktails while you wait for your movie + Gorgeous screening rooms + Large, comfy, couch-like seats with swing-out dining table + HD bright giant screen + Magical red button table service  Kinks that need improvement: - Popcorn.  Come now.  Fancy food is great, but please don't forget the quality in our old movie standard. - Checking out at the end of the movie became a bit of a circus. - The food.  It was hit or miss.  All the dishes were plated beautifully gourmet, but was a little short on flavor.  However, keeping in mind that this is a MOVIE THEATER, I hold no real complaints.  Just anticipation for what they do next.  Overall, four stars for filling a void in Uptown, and doing it with style.  It truly is the perfect date night spot.  Dinner and a movie and then off to dancing at the clubs next door.    It was a wonderful experience and I can see potential for greatness as this venue finds it's roots."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely the worst. Have been here twice and each time the food was served cold. The staff isn't friendly at all and don't show any desire to continue working here or to create a positive guest experience."}
{"text":"This place is great on opening weekend for a big blockbuster . . . assigned seating =  no wait in lines!! I really enjoy being able to walk straight in 5 min before the movie starts. The food and service is top quality, I LOVE the Frozen Hot Chocolate! Like other people have said, my only complaint is the food is just a bit too pricey. Even so it really is very good food. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So.... We've been coming here for quite some time. I'd say over the course of at least 2yrs.. And it has progressively gone down hill. Now I loved this place in the beginning. Good food. Decent prices. And movies. It was great. Then. The service started to suck, the food was gross and everything was expensive. They have changed so much. Such as tonight. We haven't been here in about a month and we found out that if you pay with card they charge you before anything even shows up. Not a fan of that. Also I ordered a glass of wine and it's less than half a glass. Come on now. Can't say I'm coming back anytime soon. Let's hope they can manage making a decent salad tonight...."}
{"text":"Having worked in customer service I understand sometimes things don't go as planned but this was a horrible experience from start to finish. Wanting to get dinner and a movie my friends and I decided to try this place out. Worst mistake ever.  With the location being at the epicenter we hoped for a good time. Because of the size of our group (6 people) we wanted to make sure we could all sit together so we purchased our tickets four hours before the start of the movie. When we went to purchase tickets online none of the seats in the theater had been reserved. We chose seats 8-13. When it came to checkout the website started messing up so after several attempts we decided to head up there to make sure we had those seats. The ladies I spoke to upfront seemed clueless and annoyed. I asked to purchase seats 8-13 and she said they had been blocked off because we tried to purchase them online. She said the online reservations had been messing up it was an ongoing issue. I asked if she could make sure they were our seats (if they weren't we would have gotten other seats). She couldn't tell me if it was us who had reserved those seats but since they were the only ones booked she said she would give us tickets to the worst seats and we would just sit in 8-13. After two ladies up from assured me those would be our seats I thanked them and left. Little did I know it would be a huge ordeal come showtime. After showing up half an hour before the movie started they told us it would be just a few minutes before we could be seated.  We had to wait outside the theatre for 20 minutes for it to be cleaned. Once we finally settled into our seats 8-13 we ordered our food. A group of people came up and said they had reserved the seats up to seat 11.. I let them know the situation and the server said they must have double booked and that group sat in other seats in different rows. As soon as the food came out the manager came to tell us we were in the wrong seats. After explaining the situation and agreeing with us that the lady I spoke to upfront was wrong he still rudely asked us to move seats. At this point the movie was starting, the whole theatre was basically filled and our actual seats were \"the worst in the theatre\" aka front row. After we didn't budge because our dinner was in front of us and it wasn't our fault it was his staffs fault he came back and gave us 5 free movie passes (there were  6 of us). Thanks but we definitely won't be going back. During the movie people were talking loudly, the servers were walking around the entire time, and it was absolutely freezing in the theatre (even being dressed for the snow outside and wearing my ski jacket I was cold). When we asked for coffee to warm us up it took 30 minutes for them to tell us they didn't have decaf which was fine but then they let us know that at this point they had already dumped the regular coffee for the night. Then came the checks. We got over charged and it looked as if other people in the theatre did too because of how many times the servers had to go back and fourth up and down the stairs. Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had. Do not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a chance to attend a matinee showing which offered a reduced ticket pricing and I believe the ticket prices are comparable to other places and not overly priced. I researched reviews before deciding to purchase tickets and many of them lowered my expectations especially the quality of the food and mentions of using office chairs and there was nothing explain what the couples seating looked like. Looking at the seating chart it was hard to imagine what the seats were like because there were no pictures, which made me suspicious; were hiding something? It was common sense to me that the office type chairs must be located at the counter seating (C) and the couple seating were the (A) & (B) selections and they had to be a different style, which turned out to be somewhat accurate. The seating chart has dotted lines leading you to think these were short sections of counters but that wasn't so, in actuality there is a solid line of counters stretching from one side to the other of the auditorium with the office type chairs lined up behind them. The chart also doesn't reflect how much spacing there is between the rows, so for those reading this there is a 5' walking isle behind the office chairs and the couples seating is directly behind that, then the next length of counter space is directly behind those seats and so on. They could use a lesson from how iPic shows their seating charts, like the spacing and layout where the seats are placed along with pictures. The isle walking space was convenient for the servers and people to use, unlike other theaters (including iPic) that you have to excuse yourself as you squeeze through to get to the end isles. The couple seats are like over-sized office chairs but without the wheels and swivels, the center arm rest will flip up and the back tilts slightly, they were about as comfortable as the soft tilting back chairs as some Harkins and AMC theaters have. The VIP (V) seats were at the ends of the rows which don't get the best sound and screen quality and they appeared to be a little softer but because of the location there is nothing VIP about them.  Now the food; well I've had worse at theaters but for the price I would expect better. The $10 all you can eat pizza was OK but nothing special and better than heated up frozen pizzas like most theaters have. I had pepperoni first then Italian sausage; both needed more meat or thicker slices as the meat flavor was over powered by the dough and sauce. My wife chose the overpriced Tenderloin Tip entree with sweet potato fries which were warm and soft with no crunch at all and the meat was hospital food bland but good after she doused it with salt and pepper. But if you think about it all theater foods and snacks are overpriced, as Dan Harkins once said in an interview, \"I sell popcorn, candy and soda, the movies are included in the price\", meaning if they didn't have concessions less people would go to the movies because the price would be so high to pay for the reel rentals. I liked the plastic serving dishes because they were quite, the noise of clinking plates and utensils at iPic drives me nuts when you're used to a quieter environment in a theater.  The bar was well stocked and the prices were about the same as the surrounding pubs and restaurants, if you order beer and plan of having more than 4-glasses order a large picture, they won't mention it but it's a better deal until they read this and figure it out, then it might change. And that's all I have to say about that!"}
{"text":"Wow movies and dinner in one! Can we say awesome!! Plenty of parking and the place is new! Seats are comfy you can chose from the actually table seats with office like chairs of movie style chairs with a attached side table. Service at a push of a button. A full service bar can you say movie and drinks I love I love! If you want you can choose your seat if you book online. Movie tickets matinee are dirt cheap! $7 for adults $5.50 for kids and seniors 55 and up. Get your new movie on in a new theatre and in style!. Prices for food are moderate but they have specials like       MARGARITA MONDAYS $2 off margaritas, frozen or on the rocks BEER + BURGER TUESDAYS $2 off regular beers, $2 off burgers ENDLESS PIZZA WEDNESDAYS $9.95 per person PITCHER THURSDAYS $2 off any appetizer with purchase of a pitcher of beer,  pitcher of margarita, or bucket of beers  alsp theres always groupons for $5.50 i think and it includes a ticket and a free drink such a steal be on the lookout!"}
{"text":"Okay...go for the comfy seats, the cool atmosphere, the cheap prices, maybe even the milkshakes. But do not go here if you want any kind of quality meal. Check out groupon often for $5 movie deals!"}
{"text":"Its like being in first class on a plane while watching the big screen!  Unlike most of the theaters around Studio Movie Grill allows you to sit, relax and order food, drink and booze at the touch of a little red glowing button.   That's right, if you have not gone here before, check out the menu before hand online so you are ready to order when you get in.    Grab your Groupon/Living Social, get your ticket, go into the theater and straight away you will notice the difference.  Polite and friendly staff are waiting to help you to your seat and show you the ropes.   Firstly you will notice that the theaters are smaller, and have few rows,  maybe 12 rows of seats depending on what size movie screen.  Most of the rows are double wide pleather seats with drink holders and large swing out trays with little red buttons on them.   Some rows are just office chairs with a small bench table.   TIP: order straight away, the place fills up and gets busy.  Food takes about 15 mins to come in but the SMG staff have everything running like a really well oiled machine.   Order your food, drink and booze... sit back and watch the ads and previews.  The staff dissipate just before the movie but are still on call if you need refills or more food and drink.    They have great food and at decent prices and portions!  Its very easy for 2 people to get drinks, movie and food for under $40.    Fries and Sweet potato fries are plentyfull!  things that bug me but does not put me off.  Condiments. (no salt and pepper around) I never ask by the time they would bring it my meal would be cooler... so i bring my own!! :)  Napkins.  Never enough given but i ask.  Plates... they really dont take the empty plates away and you dont have room to spare.  3D.  Am not impressed by the 3D screens."}
{"text":"I have been to this movie theater many times and this time (tonight) was horrible ! We went to see the new captain America movie and the screen blacked out five different times during the movie! Now I understand  stuff happens , I work in the restaurant industry , but the manager or whoever was handling this movie was completely rude! After the fifth time of the movie blacking out the manager comes out and says there passing out tickets for everyone to come back and see it well I'm sorry I didn't pay $70 in total not to finish the movie ! Don't get me wrong our server was unbelievably fantastic but the manager didn't handle the situation properly AT ALL ! He just tried to run away from the problem til many customer confronted him about how what he did was not right ! Like I said been there many times and probably will go again but the way the manager handled it was completely out of line. He pretty much  ran away and tried to ignore the situation. Hopefully the GM will be there next time something like this happens.."}
{"text":"We went to this theatre for the first time to see Cinderella. I did not know it was dinner and a movie! That was really exciting. The only problem is that I got tickets late so we were in the back of the theatre. At a normal theatre this wouldn't be a problem. But since they serve food here you have to ignore the servers walking up and down the isles. The theatre was so clean and the food was not overly priced, especially for a theatre.   Great value and great environment."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Go for a movie, not the food.   We went to a matinee recently and were impressed with the experience. Very, rather. The girl at the ticket counter was gracious and charming, the staff throughout the theatre were charming as well, and the seats.....I wanted to take one home. They are the most comfortable seats in any theatre I've ever been to. The biggest plus about seeing a movie here (since it's the EpiCentre) is validated parking. That'll seriously save you some dough and will help you forgo a walk through nasty weather, should it be one of those days, to park in the EpiCentre's garage.   Mondays are the day to go if you want to drink whilst watching your choice film. Half off house margaritas? Yes, please. They are actually pretty good, too. They even do this thing called a \"metldown\" that gives you an extra shot and some other goodies. They'll even tailor your marg to your liking. Nice touch, SMG.   We ordered the duo dip. Meh. Save yourself the disappointment. It was just wrong. The cheese was a brick of GROSS and the guac stuff was a little off. The cracker-y things tasted stale. Definitely wouldn't order it again. However, I'm happy to report that the popcorn is fantastic! $5 gets you a gracious amount, too.   Suffice is to say that I really dig SMG....for the movies. I'll definitely look forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Ok, first - I went here when they first opened in Charlotte and my husband and I had a great experience. So, we decided to go back a few months ago and watch a movie and enjoy dinner there. The food was o.k. - nothing special. It was a lot of pre-packaged, frozen things put together to look fancy. The main problem is the workers there. I believe they go on the streets and find sign holders to work there. All of them looked sloppy, they had no idea what was going on. It made us feel like we were at a bad section of town watching a movie, where we were supposed to be uptown having a nice elegant experience. Will not be going there again. We will try Cinnabar."}
{"text":"Out of all the theaters in Arizona, this takes the cake!  -Nice lobby with a bar -Movie posters that play trailers -Groupon deals: $6 for a movie and a free soda -Big leather seats -Food & drinks through out the movie -Good service -Good food: my favorite is the coconut chicken tenders -No cellphone use rules are enforced (love that)  If I lived in Scottsdale I would always come here. Maybe they will expand around the valley someday."}
{"text":"We loved going to movies here when they first opened but now I avoid this place like the plague. The food has always been mediocre on its best day but they had good coupons and a unique offering. Now with every valley theater offering wine and lounge seats at a better deal I will take my family elsewhere. Staff clearly hates there job and it shows in how they treat people."}
{"text":"During the summer, when the college and high school students are working as waiters avoid this place like the plague. Service was horrific, the food was poor, and a million different waiters will answer your call button and ignore you never bringing back what you ask for. Go to Cinnebarre in the Arboretum for a movie dining experience. The service is much better, you don't have to fight through the nightclub crowd, and the food doesn't taste like it came out of an easy bake oven.   I only gave this trash experience one star because the movie was good. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL"}
{"text":"this is a very cool concept. the movie/grill/bar idea is new and exciting. i was definitely looking forward to it. first of all i got a good deal through Groupon. adult tix are 9 bucks and i got for 5 plus a free drink so score there. i went to serf ghost protocol ay 125pm so there weren't very many people. the bar is in the lobby if u want to order drinks there but you can order them in the theater as well. the theatre was clean which i liked. my wife and i sat in chairs with a school-like desk attached to it. the chairs were quite comfy. there is also another section with office like chairs, so if you arrive soon enough you can avoid.those. while the pre show and trailers played the friendly staff took your order. the food arrived promptly and was very delicious (we.both ordered a turkey burger which came with sweet potato fries... yum ). at any time throughout the film if you needed anything you can push a red button on your chair to call an attendant. they arrived after a couple of minutes and filled my drink.   all in all the experience was very pleasant. i didn't mind so much the staff coming up to me during the film with my order because after all i did place it. but if you are the kind of person that dislikes interruptions during a movie, this place may not be for you. also we watched an early afternoon showing and had good service. i can only imagine if the theatre was full (say a movie's opening weekend) and the service quality dropped. it is overpriced for the food and drink so i suggest either eating and drinking before hand or if you don't mind dropping some cash then go ahead and treat yourself."}
{"text":"d-i-r-t-y.     and dark.  they run hand in hand.    seriously.  great concept and all, but bring your own lysol, purel, and vacuum if possible.   service was pretty quick."}
{"text":"SMG is a pretty decent establishment. I've always been a fan of Mez/ EpiCenter Theatre back in the day and it's hard to say whether or not the new management brings anything more to the table really. Don't get me wrong, the bar and food selection is still great, but it is outrageously over priced.   The atmosphere and service *can be* great at times. Really contingent on the movie you see/ how packed in everyone is. Speaking of which, the new seats are absolutely fantastic. It is literally your own recliner (not really a recliner, fyi) with a swingable TV tray, and separate cup holder. Amazing.  The HD visual and audio qualities are still very good.   They also validate parking for parking in the EpiCentre garage for up to 4hrs."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time and I was impressed.  I have been to Ultrastar Cinema a few times but I thought this place is much better.  Like some other yelpers mentioned if you can snag the $5 Groupon which includes a drink this is a must do.  My suggestion would be to arrive early because the ticket line can get amusement park long closer to show time.  They do usually have 5-7 workers helping customers so no matter how long it is it will move quickly so be patient.  Another benefit of getting there early is you will have a better choice of where you would like to sit.  I get anxiety about not being early for movies so we got there an hour early which might be over the top but hey that's me.  Kill some time with a drink at the bar and the staff will announce when you theater is ready.  No rush though because it is all assigned seats.  I did not want to eat anything during the movie so we went in about 30 minutes before show time.  This was perfect.  We shared the Chicken Nachos which I think were under $10 and hit the spot.  I found the staff attentive and friendly.  I know there were a few reviews with complaints about only teens working here but what do you expect-Its a movie theater not Wall Street.  Yes, the staff is really young and you won't run into a lot of 42 year old executives here but they do there job with a smile so kudos to the \"young\" staff.  The sound in the theater was great and not something I usually notice.  The two person seats would be ideal for a date night and have plenty of room.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Studio Movie Grill a few times over the past few years.  It was definitely the first place I experienced eating dinner while watching a movie and at the time it was completely revolutionary idea (at least to me).  A few of us went recently and I see some areas for improvement.    It's an intimate theater but is definitely a little worn down.  The food is pricey and it's nothing to get too excited about.  The waiters are attentive and I enjoy that you can select your seat ahead of time.  As far as movie theaters go this place is consistent but isn't as luxurious as some of the other theaters out there."}
{"text":"This Movie theater is right up my alley! Booze, food AND a great moive! if this place was in north phoenix it would get 5 starts. I really wanna come see a movie here some time with a DD so I can get hammered while I watch a really funny movie. just sayin'."}
{"text":"UPDATE: just returned here for the 1st time in over a year and I will say it looks like they have implemented some changes. The bathroom appeared to be much cleaner than previous visits and my dinner order was perfect. We will be back and update as needed.  INITIAL REVIEW 3 STARS  I and my friends go here a lot and by that I mean at least once per week.With that being said, I feel I am being fair in my review. First off I like the theater overall and the ease of pre purchase (huge perk) the food is overall pretty good, although the kitchen messes up my order more often than not. :( no big deal they remake it and all is good, The thing I am not fond of os they all of a sudden started asking for a card before you even get your food. The only other negative I can really complain about is the cleanliness of the restrooms....NOT GOOD if you are coming to a later movie, early in the day they are better. Staff needs to keep a better eye on this area. otherwise like this place!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Full menu available anytime during the movie with a push of a button to order. We sat in office chairs with a counter in front of us. Not the most comfortable but good for eating.  I'm surprised this business model hasn't caught on more. On Tuesday night the appetizers on the front page and the desserts were only $5 each. Pretty good deal. (And they take the Movie"}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is the first class cabin for movie theaters. Buying a reserved seat online is like flying with premium status. I'm never going to a normal movie theater again! So you can buy a reserved seat online for like $2 extra per ticket which means no waiting in line for a seat during the opening weekend and guaranteed good seating. You have to pick up the ticket will call which also has no line because they will service people with reserved tickets before anyone trying to buy a ticket in person. The seats are comfy and you get to order food and drinks!  The popcorn is awesome - full, big kernels covered in normal movie theater butter. Definitely tasted fresher and of a higher quality than most theater popcorn which always seems really stale and the shape of the kernels is big & round instead of the normal popcorn shape. The cheese fries are awesome - excellent seasoned fries covered in nacho cheese & ranch dressing. The fries themselves are really high quality - texture of beer battered fries with seasoning so it's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The seven layer chocolate cake is amazing - thick, moist, and oh so chocolaty. After the movie they give out dinner mints to everyone which is a very nice touch.  I really am never going to a normal movie theater again. Reserved seating and food and drink service is the way to go."}
{"text":"Everything You Need To Know:   PARKING: they validate parking up to 4hours. Which is great because parking is very expensive. Be sure to park in the EpiCenter Preferred Parking Lot TICKET PRICES: Moderate. Under 10$ for a 3:00pm show per adult  THEATER SEATING: Leather seats which do not recline, but are very comfortable.  STAFF: Friendly and helpful. Offers free mints after the movie.  FOOD: Average. Prices are fair but taste is just average. We spilt the 2 for 25. Chicken nachos as the app. Which were pretty good. Nachos with cheese, lettuce, tomato, chicken, and sour cream. For entree we both had the burger, they never asked what temp we would like it. Just assumed well done. Burger was bland fries were nice. Drinks were good no free refill but you can get water for free."}
{"text":"In the past I previously gave SMG a high rating, but I am sad that I have to post this because I really enjoyed visiting this theater in the past. It has been a few months since we have been to Studio Movie Grill, and the reason is because I found a metal screw-like object in my pizza.  I spoke to a manager who was very apologetic and concerned for my health. Because of the screw-like object the manager comped my meal, as well as my husband's, and offered me anything to accommodate the two of us.   Because I enjoyed myself previous times at Studio Movie Grill I have to downgrade my original rating to 2 stars, but because the manager was thorough I am giving them an extra star."}
{"text":"I'd never even heard of these types of places so this was a unique experience. The food and drinks were average but you're eating finger food and drinking margaritas while watching a movie on a big screen. There's a button you push to get a server's attention during the movie. I gots no complaints. The only way this set up could be better for me is if someone could pee for me in the middle of the movie so that I don't have to. Okay fine, the food could be better and the drinks could be too but they're not charging exorbitant prices nor are they marketing an amazing dining experience.  I liked the seating set up as well. There are \"couple\" seats with little tables that swing out in front of you and in the front, there are rows of seats. They do have daily specials like ladies night, half off margaritas, etc. I wouldn't go here for all my movie theater needs but it's worth going just to do something different every once in a while.  I think if I went on a super busy night, I could get annoyed at people being disruptive. But hey, who doesn't get annoyed at people. :O"}
{"text":"Pretty bizarre theater. Never thought I would pay to watch a movie...in an office chair. Literally a rolling-office chair. Wasn't sure if I was going to be interviewed or watch a movie."}
{"text":"The best place about this movie theatre has to be that it is located directly uptown in the epicenter and Tuesday's is 5 dollar movie night. I never miss that, right after the movies you might go to a bar or restaurant located in the same area, but get your parking ticket validated and you're doing all of the fun activities with free uptown parking. The seats aren't comfortable, the service is very forgetful(which I can understand) and it's not easy watching a movie with servers walking all infront of the screen. Besides that, it's a movie and it's only five dollars on Tuesday."}
{"text":"It is fun coming to Studio Movie Grill.  I like the concept of this movie theater where you can order food or drinks and watch a movie at the same time.  The downside is that the staff is always walking around when someone needs a refill or wants to order sometime else.    I will admit that the food is really good and they even have gluten free food too.  My favorite things are the skinny tea and potato skins.  Normally at the movies the food is not all that great.  But it is nice to know that when you come to the Studio Grill you can have decent food.   If you are looking for a place to see a movie and wanting to have dinner, you should just go to Studio Grill."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the mudslide milkshake and the service was fine, but the popcorn was very disappointing. You would think that such a fancy theater could at least master classic movie popcorn, but no such luck!"}
{"text":"Oh Studio Movie Grill, how you disappoint. Poor service, sub par food, over priced food. I want you to be better, but each time you find a new way to disappoint. This time very, very limited menu along with all of the above."}
{"text":"So good and so bad at the same time.  THE GOOD:  You can reserve your exact seats in advance. I love this because i hate having to worry that I won't get good seats and having to show up early to make sure I get them.  You can order drinks or food right at your seat. I think this is both good and bad, actually because I was on a diet and could not eat anything - but I had to smell not just popcorn but now hamburgers, wings, fries etc. Not the best experience when you are trying not to eat unhealthy stuff or when you just don't feel like smelling food.  The seats are very comfortable and larger than regular seats.  THE BAD:  This theater has seen better days - the shine and polish are gone.  Having servers moving around during the movie is a little distracting. I am a movie fanatic and I hate anything disrupting my state of suspended disbelief.  Unless you are going to the EpiCentre for something else or walking there (which I did) parking is a little bit of a pain."}
{"text":"Great idea for Scottsdale.  I would recommend buying tickets on line.  The theaters have comfortable airline style seats with a generous table that flips away.  Full bar menu with pub grub.  When ordering popcorn, don't pour the extra butter that comes with on popcorn.  Trust me - there is plenty or you will be scrambling for napkins after doing the backstroke in melted butter."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here for the first time over the weekend.  I did not like the seating. I felt like I was at a work conference. My table/tray thing was dirty and chipped and caught my shirt.  We will stick with iPic and the AMC on 24th street for luxury."}
{"text":"This theatre offers great movies, great prices (groupon normally available) with decent food. Try to get an actual seat instead of the rolling office chairs. Great concept and makes for a fun afternoon or date night!"}
{"text":"All I can do is echo all of the other reviewers. This is a great concept and I hope it expands to the east coast. It was a real pleasure to watch a movie here. The food was good, pub quality eats.  It's tougher to eat in the dark than I expected but I managed to keep my Chicken Sandwich off my shirt. Nice selection of beers, although it was a mistake to order a pitcher instead of just individual pints (Honey Bunny and I don't knock 'em back like we used to). Fed a party of 3 for $40 including tip. Not too bad.  We sat at the counter on comfortable office type chairs. Their footprint was a little large so we locked wheels a couple of times but otherwise it was a much better experience than sitting in traditional theater style chairs. So nice not to have to share an armrest. There are chairs with their own built in tables and big ol' LazyBoy style recliners that I'd be afraid of falling asleep in.  This is an amazingly civilized way to watch a movie (\"This is the End\" - very, very funny). Will come back the next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went to see a movie with friends and was surprised to find out that it was indeed a dinner and a movie type deal, where dinner is served in the movie theater. I was kind of excited, it seemed like a cool idea- and went into it with a very open mind.   I wasn't particularly impressed.  Tickets were cheap, the food was not, but obviously they've got to pay for the TONS of staff somehow.  I got two adult beverages and an entree, including the tip and the movie ticket for just under 45 dollars.  This, I expected.    What I didn't expect was for the \"tray table thing\" to be wobbly and uneven, causing me to have to hold my drink for the duration of the movie to avoid it tipping over.  I also didn't expect the food to be bland and cold, however, I suppose that to accommodate a full theater of movies goers at approximately the same exact time, you have to have some items already prepared.  I got a margherita pizza, and it tasted fine... bland and cold but it's a movie theater... I wasn't expecting much.  Long island ice tea was very, very sweet- but fine.  It was huge, however I don't think there was much alcohol in it.    Checks come about halfway through.  If you plan to get to the movie late, I guess you better hope they have the menu online cause its impossible to read it in the dark theater.  Also, its not the place to see a movie where minute details are important, as you will lose some clarity when wait staff comes and goes during the film, you have to pay your check, etc.  Much louder than a usual movie though, I assume to accommodate the hustle of staff.  Cool experience, I'd go again, it would truly depend on the type of movie.  ON a side note, the location in the EpiCentre is AWESOME.  Cool view of the city, neat place to be on a Friday or Saturday with live music and other attractions.  Parking sucks, arrive early."}
{"text":"First off the owner or whoever is actually in charge should really invest some more time and attention to this movie theater. Movie rooms 4 and 5 don't have AC so you literally are sitting in a sauna. Service beyond slow. Majority of the items were not available. Didn't get my drink until an hour after the movie started."}
{"text":"Office chairs in a movie theatre? Who's brilliant idea was that? And... if you sit in the chairs directly behind the \"office chairs\", and a tall person sits down, you won't see the screen at all.  We were the second couple to arrive in the theatre entire waiting to have our order taken. We were there 25 min early and not once did the waitress come, and we pressed our button several times. Once the rest of the theatre started filling up, the waitress went right to those people. So, not once did our order get taken. We ended up leaving early and got a refund.  What a complete let down this experience was. Will not recommend this and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not sure what's holding me back from a five star review, maybe the feel of the lobby.... Felt hollow / desolate. I know that may be a petty thing to gripe about but i feel it leads to the overall feeling of the place upon entering. Maybe some music to fill the empty space?Food was great, staff was awesome (more so than AMC) and their sound system cranked. Much better from last time i went, about 2.5 yrs ago. Better lighting chairs and tables."}
{"text":"The movie seating itself is just fine, but the food..........  The food is terrible.  I've been here, what, 3 times. I gave you 3 shots at it, Studio Movie Grill. And you missed all of them.  First of all, the food is so overpriced for its terrible quality. My first time here was for my friend's birthday. The pizza was alright. It tasted like something I could make in the microwave.  My second time was with my cousins and we ordered the nachos, which were super hard to eat(the chips were like rocks and it's really hard to eat with your fingers in the dark).  My third time here was watching one of the Star Treck Movies. I order the crab cakes(yup, living the high life) which were priced at around $$$$$$$$18. They tasted alright, but nothing I would pay twenty dollars for! Maybe five bucks.   So this is how they make their profit.  You can go here, for your kid's birthday party(they probably just care about the movie), but if you are an adult, or a decent teen who likes to have a nice lunch, forget about it. Just walk out the door. Go to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Overall experience was good. The food was just okay, I wouldn't have dinner again. We had a hamburger and the fish and chips. It was not served hot. Enjoyed a bottle of wine with the movie, would do that again. I expected more based on how they advertised the importance of the food."}
{"text":"This is truly dinner AND a movie... Movies in Uptown are back! Studio Movie Grill (SMG) is a great addition to Uptown.   For those of you who visited Mez, SMG has a similar set up. One of the changes is the addition of a swing out table at each seat.  Think of it as a cooler version of those classroom flip tables - only it's attached to a plush movie recliner rather than a hard plastic seat that's too small for your bottom. The reason for the swing out table?  Well, you get to eat at your seat... but don't worry about balancing a meal while trying to find a seat, you can order at your seat too. Each seat has a little red button that you press when you're ready to order. The food is pretty good too - definitely better than your standard nachos.  I had the sun-dried tomato and arugula pizza and my husband had the cheese quesadilla with fries.    The food came out pretty quickly and the servers were pretty attentive. One thing I did notice was that it's not pitch black when the movie is playing - I did appreciate this as I wanted to see what I was eating. But this may annoy some hard core movie lovers who want complete darkness and no outside distractions interrupting their movie.   But I enjoyed my first time there - we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to see a movie, despite any kitchen hiccups.  Kitchen & bar are not on the ball 2nd night in a row.  If you order extra items on your pizza, 50/50 they'll be thrown on AFTER it comes out of the oven.  Even if if you ask, the kitchen insists on adding your items AFTER the cheese, so they fall off when you pick up a slice.  Makes me think pizza isn't made to order.  Kitchen is much better mid-week.  I am the 1st to admit that I certainly couldn't cook for a hundred people every 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I'll never go back. Despite it being a busy weekend night, only one employee was working at the ticket counter and was doing her best to manage the influx of people having problems with the self-serve booths and everyone in line. When I went to use the bathroom before the movie, the bathroom was DESTROYED - puke covering one of the toilets and toilet paper dispensers torn off the wall and laying in the floor - so I told an employee and pushed the \"needs service\" button on the bathroom wall. After the movie TWO HOURS LATER I returned to the bathroom to find it in the exact same state (puke still everywhere, nothing picked up). Before the movie started, we ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer and a pizza and burger for our main course. 45 minutes later, we still hadn't received our chips and salsa, so we asked our waitress what was going on. Her response was, \"Oh, they still haven't brought that to you?\". About 20 minutes later, we got our main courses and again asked our waitress about the appetizer that we hadn't received but had already paid for. The food tasted like it was from a gas station, and we never got our appetizer (my husband eventually just asked for popcorn instead). Unbelievably bad service and disgusting facility."}
{"text":"I have gone here two times. I thought the first was just a bad day..nope. Tried it again and the sound was so horrible. I have better sound at my apartment. The food is way over priced and the seating is so uncomfortable and weird. I paid money to sit in an office chair and have a desk with lights that dont to out distracting me the whole time. Speaking of distracting, the constant sound of people clinking their glasses and silverware is rather annoying. And it just so happens alot of elderly people go here and for some reason they like to talk and talk the whoooollllleee time, even after asking them to please be quiet(not the theatres fault I know) but its a reoccurring situation and I think they ahould have stricter rules on talking. So all in all I will NEVER go here again and would not recommend it unless you like to pay money for something you can do at home for free."}
{"text":"It was ok. Would have liked recliner chairs. Drinks were not that great. I had to ask for more vodka for my drink because it taste like just juice. We didn't eat so not sure about that food. But watching the movie was good!"}
{"text":"Secret life of Walter Mitty is the best movie of 2013 and I loved my experience from the food to the seating. The reason why I gave this place 4 star instead of 5 is the service. I waited a long time and never got my change and so the waiter stayed with 20 dollar tip which is way too much since i wanted change. I think he needs training since the other wait staff had to help him.   The bar was cool and spacious with enough staff and enough seats & couches.  The decoration made it feel like it wasn't a sports bar but there was a few large TV's to watch any games.  the service at the bar was better and I wish it was the same before sitting in the theater."}
{"text":"We arrived on the second floor and the attendant had an unbelievably hard time scanning my debit card to print out tickets. We also got our parking validated which is a plus. Then the escalator was broke so we had to go back outside and walk up to the third floor entrance.   The bar special was great- $20 margarita pitcher and we didn't eat there.  The drinks were good and the bartenders were chatty and nice. There were so many employees always walking around that it was distracting. The movie was enjoyable and the sound and picture were great. Def will return but not a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Don't get your hopes up... I SO badly wanted this to be a pleasant time. See, my friend's mum reserved tickets as a birthday present for me and naturally I was thrilled. We came in and sat down, cleanliness was alright.. and the customer service seemed okay? So we sat down and I ordered my drinks- then dinner for me and my sister- the drinks came with the appetizer after a very long twenty minutes but I still had high hopes. Then the entrée never came. I kid you not- I sat through almost ALL of Captain America listening to everyone else eat and wondering if I had done something wrong. So I couldn't really pay attention to the movie because the waiters kept walking in front of us. WE WERE IN THE FRONT ROW!? How do you miss somebody in the FRONT ROW?!!? So when a waiter eventually came by and said the food would be out in the near future I asked to speak with a manager because I had no intention of paying for food that takes over an hour to arrive- I wasn't even hungry at that point. Okay- so then there was the manager who took her sweet time about checking in on us (and of course they brought the food out and played stupid), I asked if she wanted to talk outside of the theater namely because hearing was almost impossible with the obscene amount of explosions taking place in the film. She declined. I told her I hadn't touched the entrée and I rightly deserved a discount or something to compensate given it was my birthday. So then she hands me free tickets to another movie and informs me that  have to pay full price for food that came out cold and flat drinks that were refilled hourly. Because that is EXACTLY what I wanted!!! To come back and receive horrible customer service TWICE!?? Of course I took them because I'm past keeping my pride (I know they don't care) and there I was- April 19th with two tickets and a forty-dollar bill in my hand. Thank you SOOO much for these tickets, even though I'll never use them. I hope this takes one of your 3.5 stars down."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this theater to watch the kid's movies.  It is so much easier to manage the twins and for that reason, I thank you SMG.  Having a table across them is like a psychological stop sign.  I don't have to worry that they will jump out of their seats and run up and down the steps (that happens at the end of the movie).  They like their pizza.  The grilled chicken strips didn't go so well, I didn't even like them, a little too slimy.  I had the Kale salad, my hubby had been raving about.  My only complaint is that they take forever to give you a refill.  I had three different people come by when I turned my light on, and it took more than 30 minutes to get a refill.  I forgive all that, because I can sit down and enjoy the movie for once."}
{"text":"I had a groupon for a $6 movie plus a free drink.   We split the sausage and mushroom pizza as well as the coconut chicken strips.   Both were good! I would definitely go back to see a movie and have dinner. I didn't think it was that expensive. Not any more than you would spend elsewhere beforehand. Our food came out quickly. The only thing I wasn't sure about were the drink refills. I didn't want to buzz the waiter just for that but they don't refill your drink automatically so you have to buzz them for refills.   There is a fee to reserve your seats online (only a dollar or so) and I think it would be worth it. We waited to pick our seats until we got there and there were only bar tables (office chairs at one long bar across an aisle) and the nicer options only had weird seating locations left.   We opted for the nicer seat option and glad we did. I wouldn't ever want to sit along the bar aisle just because i can totally picture myself leaning forward and resting on the bar top. Plus office chairs aren't all that great. The large leather seats are definitely the way to go."}
{"text":"Recently went to watch  \"Think Like A Man 2\". Amazing place for a date for 2 or even a double. The food was awesome. I enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I've been here maybe 5 times now and the service for the most part is improving, but for some reason when I go out in a group I'm always the one messed up. Last night I went there and since my friends were running late I didn't sit down until the previews had already started.  I pushed my button right away and the server took my order for a burger and a water.  My burger came in a decent time, but was given to my friend instead and she passed it down to me. My water only came after I pressed my call button an hour into the movie and the guy personally ran down and ran back up to get it.  I think they kept keying my stuff under another seat. My check was given to another seat and after I paid my credit card was given to the wrong seat as well.  We're talking the other side of the section wrong. So I've had 3 good experiences and 2 bad experiences but the bad ones are clear indicators to me of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Don't like those rows with office chairs though! Not comfortable with office chairs!"}
{"text":"SMG used to be really nice to come to. As of late, the service and the food has been worse than that of the worst street vendor. Last week, we went to SMG with a big party. Only some of us were able to get seats to the movie we wanted to see. They told us the movie was sold out (although we looked a few minutes prior and the theater was more than 80% vacant). After we got our tickets, we were advised that the kitchen was closed. They were only serving candy, popcorn, and soda. That was a bummer, but seeing how we already paid for our tickets there was very little we could do. When asked why the kitchen was closed, they told us that they didn't have cold water... When we got into the theater, we noticed those same seats that showed available before the start of the movie, that they claimed were sold, were available. As a matter of fact, those seats stayed empty for the entire movie.  Some of our party ordered popcorn. The price was $3 for one, or 2-4-$7. When asked about the prices, and if the 2-4-7 offered a larger bag of popcorn, the waiter became clearly agitated. FYI- the bags are the exact same size... you don't get any additional popcorn, or value for that matter. You just get ripped off. Oh yeah, and that popcorn took more than 40 minutes to come out. Ridiculous! Speaking to management after this fiasco, she said that people had called out and the staff could not handle a theater full of people ordering items. Considering the kitchen was closed, I don't see how that would be an issue. However, seeing that they couldn't even serve a basic staple of the theater (popcorn) within a decent amount of time, I had a better understanding.  Management also explained that they do not have to tell the public when they decide to close out a show. That's not our concern. Mind you, they did not update their website, or their phone directory to update those who may be coming from far distances or with large parties. Our last few visits have been less than stellar but easy to overlook. Based on the customer service, the blatant lies, and the attitudes, we will not return. I hope they realize that they are not the only show (no pun intended) in town."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to this theater because you can order food and drinks and park Uptown for free. It feels like a more extravagant outing than going to a regular movie theater. However, it is really frustrating to pay what it costs for a movie ticket and food/drinks (which is not cheap!) to then try to get out of the parking deck and find out they didn't validate your ticket properly and now you owe $10 for parking. I contacted the company and was passed on to the local manager by corporate, but never got a response."}
{"text":"Has potential but poorly managed. Surfaces are dirty. Service is always poor. Theaters don't get cleaned in time to start the movies on schedule."}
{"text":"Went here for date night to see World War Z and the movie was great but the experience was not. The food was super expensive and not all that great...half a hand full of fries and 5 chicken tenders for $10.95 is ridiculous. Plus they serve through the whole movie which is distracting. The servers interrupted us during the movie numerous times about the check and trying to bill us for someone else's order. Quite annoying. 3D glasses were scratched and made it hard to watch the movie. I'm glad I only got one Groupon for the tickets because I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Theatre is very nice. Seats are not as comfortable as you would think. They have like office chairs in every other row. Also the food is not good, and it's so overpriced. Did you know it costs a dollar to put onions on your burger? Want cheese? That's another dollar. And it's not even good. Screen is beautiful and a clean picture though.. 3D was great."}
{"text":"The best part about this theater is that you can purchase and reserve your seats online in advance and there's no reason to show up an hour early to get a good seat.   Also, if you buy your tickets online, there's a kiosk inside the door where you can swipe the credit card used to buy the tickets or enter your confirmation code and bypass waiting in line to pick up your tickets. The printer prints your tickets and you can go right in to get seated.   Some of the seats are counter seats with office chairs. I don't usually reserve those because I prefer the booth type seats with tables. They are really comfortable.   The food is pretty good and is getting better. The coconut tenders and street tacos are favorites in my family. I really like that I can eat and watch a movie at the same time.   I don't think SMG is that expensive given the convenience. Also, they offer Groupons all the time, and there are specials in their e-mails. The whole outing can be expensive, but if you were going out to eat anyway, it probably works out to be about the same cost.   This is my favorite place to see a movie in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Check groupon for deals before you buy your tickets.  Don't book online to save the online booking fee.  Park at the EpiCentre and they will validate 4 hours of parking.  Check out the specials before you go, they have everything  from all you can eat pizza, to $5 margaritas, $3 beers, $2 off burgers...  Sometimes the lines at the box office can get quite long before the show, either use the kiosks or plan ahead!"}
{"text":"I wonder if this is as good as it could be?  Not thrilled about the prices on the drinks, but I guess it keeps people from getting hammered at the movie theater?! The food is decent, the new menu seems a bit ambitious with some of the entrees; I hope they can pull it off! At least a GF pizza and a GF hamburger bun are a nice inclusion for those of us with an allergy.   The staff is always welcoming, happy, kind...and this goes a long way, along with the regular Groupon ticket option, toward making this theater one I return to once a month to enjoy the latest chick flick or family film :)"}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is a hit or miss. I've taken my employees here, my mom here, my friends here and we have had great experiences. Unfortunately out of the dozens of times i have been here it has been more of a miss than a hit.  The food is actually good and reasonably priced, the problem is who knows if you'll get it cold, or the right food, or if you'll get it at all. Why have i been here so many times then?...the $5 movie ticket Groupon that had been up there for years of course.   So i went to smg with my husband with the full intentions of grabbing a full meal while enjoying a movie, like we've done plenty of times before. I arrived early because i knew the theater was packed and i wanted to order my food before the movie began. Unfortunately, the movie started at 8 and they didn't let anybody in the theater until 8. They said they were cleaning up from the previous movie which was a poor job because my tray table along with others beside me were still dirty. Still hoping for the best, we sit down and immediately hit our light. A theater with every seat taken and they decided to only have one server for the first 10 minutes!  Finally two more pop up and there is still hope to order our food before our(now delayed) movie begins.  So if they get a star for anything it's for $5 movie tickets and $5 select apps and drinks, all on Tuesday's. They also have other daily specials. Ordered things we had before, half order cheese fries, half order nachos and buffalo bites( because they ran out of tenders ) and two waters. Food came out quick, but you guessed it....cold!my husbands fries and nachos were decent so he kept it but my bites were way to cold. Hit the light and wait 15 minutes for somebody to come. I explained the problem and they put in another order for bites. We reminded them we have not received water and need silverware. 15 minutes later i get kind of hot chicken. We remind them of water and silverware. The server quickly brings us back 1 thing of silverware and runs away. Mind you it's two of us. I just decided to eat my saucy buffalo chicken with my hands. Movie ends and if you caught on you realized we never received our water. Spicy and dry food with no water was a wonderful movie experience. Sad part is them forgetting my drink is not a first. It has happened a couple times before. They charged me for both the cold and hot chicken bites so i had to find a server and got the manager to fix it.   So in conclusion, maybe just stick to watching a movie and eating before or after, this place will find a way to disappoint."}
{"text":"Okay, I have been at Studio Movie Grill 3 times now and have given them several chances to shine, unfortunately they remain dull.  If you want to watch a movie, go for it, they have comfortable seating but don't waste your money on the food and drink, actually the drinks are okay but there are plenty of fast food restaurants in the area that have more fresh food at a much reduced price.  Tonight we spent $75 on a couple of entrees and drinks. I don't mind spending that kind of money but I expect fresh, hot food and this food was obviously sitting for a long time waiting to be served, it was ice cold and so was the food of the people around us. Everyone was complaining but by the time you get a replacement meal, the movie is ending so you may as well just eat before or after the film.  I predict that studio movie grill will go the way of the drive in theaters."}
{"text":"The screen is broken and looks blurry/foggy. The pitcher of \"margarita\" we ordered was just juice with no alcohol. Seats looked old/dirty. Terrible."}
{"text":"I had to experience SMG because of all the reviews. I've been to theaters where you can order drinks etc. But not full entrees. I used a $5 livingsocial discount and was able to catch a sneak preview.   As everyone stated the ticket area and lobby is very chic and modern. However the actual theater is not. For a theater I want my seating area to be comfortable. Here, the chairs are not. They do not recline at all. So if you have any neck or back injuries I recommend sitting way in the back so you do not have to position your neck up right for over an hour. I sat in the individual (a/b or heart) seats row E. The area was not as clean as the lobby. The cup holder had trash in it and left over food crumbs. I ordered the strawberry daiquiri, you can barely taste the rum. But it was sweet which I didn't mind. I ordered 2 lb of hot wings for $19. The presentation of the food was nice. The wings are huge. The taste was okay. Not bad. The staff was nice. I did notice that once the movie started they were very discrete and not disturbing to others.   I also thought that although most reviews said to avoid sitting at the long tables with the office chairs, they seemed more comfortable if you were ordering food. My bowl of fries could barely fit on my table with the hot wings and my drink.   I gave SMG 3 stars because it's initial appearance was modern. However, I spent little time in the lobby so I didn't benefit from the decor. The cost doesn't match the actual experience. I spent $51 for Native New Yorker in a movie theater. The food was not exquisite enough. Mind you that was just the appetizers :-/. Thankfully the staff was really nice so I didn't have any issue with continuing my experience. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Studio Movie Grill for two reasons, 1) their concept allows you to watch movies while eating and drinking 2) their service is always excellent. Why only three stars? The food is not very good and the seating is not very comfortable.   Imagine you are at your favorite bar and order some of your favorite American bar food i.e. chicken fingers, pizza, burgers, and chips and dip. Now imagine that Jack in the Box brought it to you. You aren't disappointed but you aren't exactly raving about the food.   The drinks are very good and can say that the SMG Cab is pretty good -- well it at least gives you a solid buzz so you can get through whatever chick flick you are having to endure."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! FIrst of all, you do have to get over the fact that there are going to be servers going past you to serve others, well sorry, but thats kinda part of the whole process. If you don't want to enjoy a movie and a dinner, then go to an AMC or sit closer to the front or sit next to the wall away from the theaters entrance or   something. But with the combo of food and drink and comfy chairs and a movie, you can't beat it! The bartender \"Eric\" was awesome and made a great Long Island! This place is solid."}
{"text":"When you first walk in no one greets you. The ladies at the front desk do not smile and they look like they have attitudes. As soon as I walked in the theater I noticed how dirty the place was. The bathrooms were horrible! Trash all in the seats and floor  from the previous movie and the drink trays were just disgusting. All four of the seats I paid for were like this. I paid for the 4:30p movies and got there early so we could order our food as the website instructs you. Then 6:00 came around I had some upset children and no food. I was one of the first ones in the theater and I noticed everyone had their food and I didn't have mine. We were more than half way into the movie. No one noticed my service light so I walked out and found my server. I asked about my food and the young lady forgot to key it in. Instead of her apologizing for it she asked if I still wanted it. Of course I do! My kids are hungry that's why we came for movie and dinner! She brought out my sliders in 5 minutes and they were hard as a rock and cold. I said no onions and they were all on them. I took them back because that's not what I ordered. The girl had an attitude and still no apology so she got the manager. He told me he would fix it. The last 30 minutes into the movie I received my entire order. Well my pizza came the last 10 minutes smh. Then they hand me a bill and I should have known something was wrong when they handed me an extra drink that I told her I didn't want and not to order so I paid an extra $4 for a soda I didn't drink. When you providing that type of service I should have gotten an apology or something. This place is the worst. The other reviews were right. They need to re-evaluate their entire ordering system because it's terrible. And replace the staff. They don't have the right attitude for this job. They were very rude and I'm not the only one who was complaining.  Yes you're going to get a lot of upset people. When you're paying for a service and you don't receive it then expect the Problems that come with it."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years because the prices were fair, the service and food was good, and the place was clean and comfortable. Now, it's just ok. Things seem to slowly be going downhill. It started with using the self service kiosk to pick up our tickets. You should be able to scan the code they email you but we never got it to work. Neither did the people next to us trying to scan there code. We went in and grabbed our seats and the tray tables on two of three seats that we had were bent so bad anything you out on them started to slide. My cup holder was wet and sticky but since my tray table was so uneven I had no choice but to use it. My husband and I ordered the two for $25 deal which consists of an appetizer and two entrees and my son got a pizza from the kids meal. Our entrees arrived before the appetizer and when the server brought our meals he put both adult entrees on my tiny tray and said \"here is the chicken for you guys\"....why he couldn't be bothered to properly deliver both of our meals was beyond me. The coconut chicken tenders were good but the fries were undercooked. Buyer beware....sodas are $4.00 each. Refills are free though. Don't pass up on the mind they offer on your way out either.  The movie was good...The sound and screen quality are good as was the temperature. Sometimes movie theaters freeze me out during the summer but it was quite comfortable here.  The ladies room had a line after the movie. One of the stalls was out of order and there was no paper towels in any of the dispensers. I know it is Saturday night but you must stay on top of the restrooms no matter how busy it is.   I am hoping things have just been a little off recently and the quality will improve again because we do love the dine-in theater concept."}
{"text":"Great concept but could you feedback and improvement! The server was rude and way too loud. I understand she doesn't want to screw up, but it's still a movie, be courteous! Having the kiosk to print tickets it's great if you want to avoid just standing in line. Great theater inside and out. Food was so gross!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I don't really get to have a date night due to our work schedules. When we do, we want to enjoy ourselves and each other. As fans of the first Pitch Perfect movie, we decided to use part of our date night to go to Studio Movie Grill in Scottsdale and watch Pitch Perfect 2. Boy, what a mistake. The movie started out and everything was fine. Then about a quarter of the way through, the screen cut out while the sound was still playing. We missed a good 5 minutes of the picture and only got sound. The employee came in and assured us that the issue was addressed. After about 15-20 minutes of watching the film, missing out on part, the screen cut out again and the lights came on. We still only had sound, and the theater was as bright as it is when you walk in. They got the picture working again, but the theater was still lit up. We pressed the service button just to have the same employee come in and turn them off while shaking his head at the customers who paid good money to enjoy the movie. We were told that they were going to have passes to another movie for the inconvenience. So about another 15 minutes of them getting the picture back, it cuts out AGAIN, this time the sound switched to the advertisements that play before the movie starts, and AGAIN the lights turned right back on. At this point I was frustrated. The manager, or who I assume is the manager due to his blue shirt, came up and said that he had spent countless time trying to get the movie turned off in the theater due to missing so much of it. Date night ruined. We did not get to see the rest of the movie, and was told that we could attend the next showing of the movie. I did not have 5 hours of my life to waste sitting around and waiting for the next showing. This place has become a disaster. The food is horrible, was once semi-decent, and the service is something that I would expect from a Jack In The Box restaurant. So we left without getting to enjoy the movie that we paid for, while SMG Scottsdale felt deserving of our hard earned money. Beware. This place has gone downhill. I MIGHT return to use the free movie pass, but even then I wouldn't be confident in the ability to get through an entire movie. Thanks SMG Scottsdale. Great way to keep that reputation!"}
{"text":"This place is a dump. The movie theaters are always dirty, the bathrooms are always a mess, and the food is over priced. But at least the movie ticket prices are cheap with coupons."}
{"text":"Sooooo... I'm giving them 3 stars b/c the Manager took care of our bill. Ya see this is the second time my b/f and I had an issue with the service on two separate occasions. First time they didn't bring my water when I asked twice and didn't bring the bill. This time (tonight) they brought our food to the wrong people, took it back, brought it back out after 15 min., it was cold... I told them we didn't want it (no attitude) so the Manager comes and says its on him. That's great customer service! So why 3 stars???  Well... It would be different if this happened every once in a while but two times in a row. And this is the only two times I've been there. I like that the seats are comfortable. I like the tables. I like the screen, the atmosphere, the bar and all that outside, but the dining experience screwed it up for me. I'd rather concentrate on the movie rather than what I'm missing or what's wrong...   Bottom line: Get ya girl or female homie with the big purse to stuff all the goodies and snacks in it and enjoy the movie!"}
{"text":"Have come to love Studio Movie grill mostly because of MoviePass.  Get one movie per day for $9.99 and SMG is the only theater in the Valley that does e-ticketing and its soooo convenient!  Highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nice idea, much like Cinetopia in Washington state. Where this theater misses  the mark is the seating. Office chairs and a desk just don't cut it. The loungers are better but not great. They also have some small lights that stay on during the movie that are poorly placed and distracting. The popcorn was awful BUT everyone was friendly and gave great service. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was okay, I got the chicken fajita quesadilla with fries and the grind, my husband got the mushroom and Swiss burger with fries and strawberry lemonade. The cheese wasn't melted nor did it have enough cheese for it to be called a \"quesadilla\", apparently the chilis burgers are a lot better than this place according to my husband.  Now for the service, the bartender (Amanda) she was rude and in a hurry. Our food came quick but it took her a LONG time for a little cup of ranch. She kept giving us the evil eye as we were waiting on the ranch.  When we asked for a to-go box she said \"ok good\"  We said please and thank you to everything we weren't rude not mean.  Maybe next time (if there is a next time) we'll get a different more nicer person."}
{"text":"This place has seriously gone downhill over the last few years. The food used to be pretty good but now it's terrible. I've tried something different the last 4 times I've gone and every time it was nasty. Fries are always soggy (even though we ask for them extra crispy every time), the sandwich bread is hard and greasy, the \"three cheese\" sliders had such a thin layer of cheese I think it was spray-painted on, everything is cold; I could keep going.  The only reason I kept coming here was because 1. I live right across the street and 2. I like being able to reserve seats. I went with my mom and sister yesterday and some woman was wearing such a heinous amount of horrible perfume that my mom had an allergic reaction and we had to leave halfway into the movie. The manager refused to refund our movie tickets, even though we paid $65 for the crappy food. He would only give us 3 passes, which will likely be tossed in the trash because none of us will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"It's definitely something new to try out.  You should go at least once.  It's a little weird your first time there.  Food is decent, prices are reasonable, and staff are quick to get to you when you press your button.  Downsides: It's dark, obviously, so it's difficult seeing where your food is because you're not used to eating in the dark.  Once you finish, your dishes sit there (even though the server may bring you another drink, they don't clean off your table...unless you physically hand it to them).    We saw, Chenobyl Diaries, which is a scary movie.  I imagine it's rated R, at least.  We saw a couple bring their 3 year old daughter to the movie.  I get it, parents are supposed to be better than that, but at the same time, shouldn't the theater have a responsibility as well.  I just wish somebody would have told them that's not okay.  Upside:  The seats are comfortable, smaller theaters, and a lot more room than your typical movie theater."}
{"text":"$5 tickets and $5 drafts on Tuesdays! Spencer was our bartender before the show, and he was great!"}
{"text":"More food:  sliders = good chicken nachos - kind of nasty.  Not a lot of chips, the chips turn all soggy and its a nachoey cheesey mess pizza - edible, but not that great"}
{"text":"I am compelled to write this review although I submitted a survey. My husband and I attended the 8pm show featuring \"Focus.\" The bottom line is that we will not be back. First of all we were outside pulling on the door to get in and it was locked. We tried the door 4 times before the young lady came to open it. We were informed that someone else was supposed to be at the door but that is crazy-to be there watching us go back & forth. It is freezing outside and we are trying to get into the theater and not knowing if there was another entrance, we had walked to another venue next door only to turn around and go back to try the SMG door. If we had not paid for our tickets on line we would have left. Additionally, because the street was closed off to CIAA-we ended up paying $20 for parking. Upon walking to the theater area. I asked a different young lady which theater is showing Focus and was promptly informed by that the person that she was leaving but did us a favor to check in our tickets-really!  We entered the theater and no guidance to our seats-we sat in close proximity to where our ticketed seat were. We sat there and noticed that there was about 3 couples when we sat down. Another couple needed a menu and we gave them one of ours. There was a special CIAA menu. When we were asked about drinks, I learned that there were no mixed drinks-like What! This was because of the CIAA-well card people and give my more than 50 year old body what I want. My husband got a Corona-I declined getting anything. I just did the survey which asked if drinks were brought within 5 minutes of order- Absolutely Not! It was almost 20minutes before my normally calm husband got his drink. People who arrived after us got their foods/drinks and my husband was fuming to the point where he was not going to call for his drink. When it did arrive, it was as though we were bothering someone. A simple sorry for the delay would have been nice. The staff was not friendly at all-only one person said good night although they saw us leaving. We walked all the way to the door that we entered through to be told that we could not leave out of that door. Well your staff watched us walk out of the movie and no guidance. The kicker was to exit the movie and see people drinking at a bar area-what happen to NOT serving drinks due to CIAA. Whatever!!! We went for the in theater dining but realized that it was waste of time to drive from Fort Mill, SC to this place.  Should have read the reviews. I will be blocking them from emailing me with offers even if it is free tickets. Not ever going back. This is our first and we will not be back-live & learn.  The reason for 1 star is because Yelp doesn't allow 1/2 star."}
{"text":"Prices for food are a bit high but that's the movies now a days. Service is alright should be more attentive. Seating you can't be beat, comfy & spacey."}
{"text":"Prett much the only theater we go to. Affordable, good food and great for families or couples who can't be out all night doing long dinners and a movie. My hubby and I can do dinner and a movie and be home in time to kiss our boys goodnight."}
{"text":"I'd love to properly review this theater except they wouldn't let me in!  I bought a couple of Groupons at Christmas and finally got around to using them last week.  The coupons are past the promotional date but they are supposed to be good  for the amount you pay forever \"The amount paid for this voucher with Studio Movie Grill Never Expires\".  But turns out they have retroactively changed policy and now you can't use them on weekends.  I wonder if they sell you a popcorn with free refills then retroactively cancel that too?  Lesson learned - stay away from this place and stay away from Groupon.  I had these guys at 1 star but corporate customer services just sent me a couple of free passes so they get a retroactive mercy bonus star - which I will retroactively erase if I have any more hassle with these guys."}
{"text":"I wish it was possible to give zero stars. Here's what happened:  The seat and table were dirty when we arrived. When we told someone she said \"sorry\" like she didn't care then then did nothing about it.  Finally when we ordered the server had an awful attitude and somehow forgot the water and the fries that were ordered.  When I asked about the water halfway through the movie they said drinks were still coming out. That was 30 minutes after we got our food. Pretty awful since I had HOT tenders.  No one was helpful and the food tastes like it comes from Quik Trip. If they gave me free tickets I still wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoy going to this place.  Ability to reserve seats takes the stress out of knowing where you are going to sit.  Don't have to worry about getting stuck with the first row!  Food and beverage is good.  Sometimes the poeple next to you may be noisy as they eat, but overall this is a very comfortable experience."}
{"text":"Came to watch girls trip at 10:15 on Wednesday 8/16. Had the worst dinning experience of my life!Waited 45 mins for chicken wings, they were cold. The manager is unprofessional and lacks conflict resolution skills. She suggested we wait for a new order, to which my husband replied \"we won't pay for it\", she took the food and never returned.  We were still charged for food and refused to pay. The manager called 3 security officers and 2 police officers!! The officers FORCED us to pay for our beverages. I WAS EMBARRASSED, and MORTIFIED!!! Not to mention I had to explain the situation to the officers while standing on one leg and crutches!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for a date night or even a night out with the family! My husband and I haven't been out in FOREVER and Studio Movie Grill was perfect. Margarita pitchers, what a bonus! Thanks to the manager Jason and his staff for taking such good care of us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times when visiting from out of state, though I've had great experiences this one wasn't one of them, im a big fan of the concept, dinning and watching a movie at the same time, I had the chicken nachos and they were amazing,I think its because they use queso instead of shredded cheese, I'd come here again just for those! So onto the bad, the movie projector kept going out so all you'd get is sound,finally after half the movie was over they decided to pull the plug on the movie,now I understand things like this happen and that wasn't the problem it was the people attending the movie they were real assholes,getting so irritate wanting money back and free movie tickets and food to be comped, I've never seen people act this way. I was happy they were able to refund my money since I don't live in the state and can't come back at a later date to see the movie again."}
{"text":"Wooohooo!  Great service, great atmosphere, great change from last movie house that was there.  The place has been completely redecorated and updated to Scottsdale chic.  Popcorn was served in open basket, easy to eat w butter on the side (love it!).  Good drinks, and free refils on the soda.  This was a good purchase and a great value for the money.  I advise anyone to try it.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely atrocious! The atmosphere and concept is amazing however the service is appalling. I was there recently and it took 1 hour to get drinks after they were ordered and even then they were watered down where the ice had melted! My chicken Alfredo was cold and the chicken was dry and hard ! I sent it back and ordered a chicken quesadilla as I had had one score and was good a few years ago but it took another 45 mins to get it after ordering and it was also cold and dried out with hard calf chicken ! They told me that were not going to charge me but I just checked my back account and they charged me $21.38 for nasty drink and nasty food ! I called to complain and left a message since nobody answered the phone !! I do NOT recommend this place . Also my friends that were with me had the buffalo chicken sliders and they were cold and nasty as well"}
{"text":"Not such a great experience last night. Main problem is that our food order never came. We ordered from the section of the menu that had two entrees and an app. The popcorn and one of the two sodas came, but that was it. When we brought it up, the server said that he'd take it off the bill. No apologies or anything else to smooth us over.  I kind of thought that there would be no bill, but they charged for one soda.  This is the third time that I've experienced a technical problem there. This time, the center channel woofer buzzed. Same as several months ago when we saw  another movie. A couple of months before that, it was yet again the same problem in another theater.  Finally, the bathrooms are horrible. The men's restroom in the lobby had smelled like piss every time I've been.  We're not sure whether we're coming back."}
{"text":"It was my first time at SMG, and also my last. It was my last because the chairs are SOOO uncomfortable. Sitting in my car is more comfortable than the stiff office chairs you get. Not impressed. I did not try the food, because I figured if it sucked as bad their chairs, it wasn't worth trying."}
{"text":"Great concept!  We have found another great movie theater!  Our daughter especially loves the idea of eating lunch at the same time."}
{"text":"While the theater was clean and the service was above average, the food is overpriced and was delivered cold-not tepid, cold. Also, don't buy full price tickets, plenty of coupon codes available online."}
{"text":"I love the concept and enjoy the theatre as well as the food. That being said...  I HATE bathroom attendants. Its creepy and obnoxious. I don't understand why any business in 2017 would have one. Water faucets automatically turn on when you place your hands under them. Soap automatically dispenses doing the same. With a wave of my hand, boom! Out pops a paper towel!   So why in the world would I want some strange dude, who smiles at me and insists on having conversation with me while I do my business, need to squirt soap into my hand and hand me a towel? What is this, 1800???  Maybe it's just me. Maybe some people like having a creepy dude grovel before you in the bathroom for a tip. I'll grant you that. But!   You should at least have a choice! When you empty the soap dispenser and deactivate the automatic paper towel dispenser in order to FORCE me to take advantage of the creepy dude, that is over the line!   I refuse to participate, so I suppose I'll have to go somewhere else, at least to go."}
{"text":"We were told the theater wasn't ready yet. The movie started at 9:15 at 9:14 the girl who takes the tickets very rudely told us the theater wasn't ready yet. When I inquired about an ETA she rudely replied the movie didn't start until 9:15 disregarding the fact that it was 9:14. Finally at about 9:17 we were told the theater was ready. We got to our seats that we brushed off and stared at a blank screen. Finally at about 9:25 the screen came on. At about the same time the waiter (Who was the only bright spot during this whole ordeal) came over to take our orders. Even though we all ordered at the same time our meals came out separately five minutes apart until the last two orders that came out 15 and 20 minutes later than the first orders. I ordered a black bean burger, received a regular burger. Our server apologized and placed the order again. Half way through the movie I finally received my cold food. Before we left we attempted to pay our bill, the computer was not working so we moved to a different computer. While our server attempted to cash out our orders the manager cut in front of us to cash out other customers like we weren't standing there. Then he interrupted our server again while he was in the middle of cashing us out. When I attempted to tell the manager about our experience he told me to \"hurry up and give him the short version so he could take something off my bill.\" I declined. I wasn't sharing my experience so he could simply \"take something off my bill\". I also wanted to compliment our server. He could careless. There are really great employees...the servers and then there is everyone else. Unprofessional, rude and indifferent. The worst of the employees seem to mimic the manager's I don't give a damn attitude. The best of the employees (the servers) try hard to make up for the short comings. I recommend you spend your money else where and avoid the frustration."}
{"text":"Nice. Like the fact that you can order a full meal while you enjoy a movie. The only thing I dislike are the seats.  They aren't the worst but I wish they were like a recliner style seat. The service was good the last two me I went. Actually I've never had a bad experience with them.  Very friendly staff. Nice bathrooms and good drinks. My daughter and sister loved the chocolate cookies. I really enjoyed the sangria margarita."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for SMG.  Thank god for $5 groupons.  So I picked my seat online and sat down before the movie started.  I didn't want any food just a beer.  So i ordered a Rebel IPA ( what no local oferrrings?) It took around 35-40 minutes before I said I can't wait any longer and pushed the button again.  Voila, i see my beer coming up the staircase. THe server hands it to me and says sorry.  Either my beer was left out due to them forgetting about me or they confused their cooler with an incubator.  Fortunately for me I don't mind warm beer.  No big woop.  I was a little parched so i slammed this bad boy.  Hesitantly i pushed the red button again.  This time the supervisor/manager came up.  He asked me what I would I like.  I pointed to the beer and put it in his tablet.  Then he asked if I am sure I ordered that beer. I stated yes.  Then he sat down next time shined a lite on me, then my beer.  Then me then my beer, before he stated that I must have switched seats. I explained I had not moved.  He continued to shine the light on me and have his table out.  The people next to me were getting quite pissed.  This went on for atleast 5 minutes which seemed like an eternity since i was destroying other people's viewing experience.  FInally he found out they gave me the first beer free for making me wait that long.  I could have really done without the accusation of \"moving my chair\" and the fact that he turned my seat into a spotlight.  The next beer came up quick.  Drank it, the movie finished, and I recieved my check.  Suprisingly the first beer was added back on!  I love the concept of this place.  Food, dinner movie, and being able to pick your seat online. Though until they get their shit together I will not be back."}
{"text":"O.k., so I finally went to SMG. The lobby area is beautiful, very relaxing and hip. When I went into the actual theater, it was cool to see how spaced out you are from the person in front of you or behind you but not so happy to see how close you are to the person you're sitting next to if you are in the office chairs (you'll know what I mean when you see them or if you've been to SMG, you'll know exactly what chairs I'm talking about.) I suggest getting the leather chairs that have your table attached to them.  The food was o.k., the burger was meh but the coconut chicken and sweet potato fries were killer.  SMG, please please please change how you plate your burgers, it's hard to see anything when your burger and fries are placed into a bowl that isn't fit for them. Just put them on a regular plate.  Also, I felt bad for the person who got seats next to where the servers put their serving trays at. Talk about annoyance, especially when you're trying to watch a movie. I felt bad for the person in front of me who had to deal with that issue during the movie.  The PRO to SMG is the prices for their movies and the concept of having food sent to you while watching is awesome."}
{"text":"I went with my friends to this place over the weekend for the first time and liked it a lot. This place is different than most movie theaters because instead of standard stadium seating, customers sit in leather recliners or desk chairs and have food served to them as if they were in a restaurant.  The food is Applebees quality but a little more expensive. My friends and I liked that fact that it was all-you-can-drink too. This place is has top notch technology in the bathrooms and lobby. TV screens and digital posters are all over the walls. This place also has a bar in the main lobby with sports on TV too. I would say that this place is comparable to the Alamo Roadhouse in Austin, Texas. So far, this is the only restaurant style movie theater that I'm aware of in the state of Arizona. I give this place 4 start instead of five because my friend did not get his drink until half way through the movie after getting his food because the server button on the seat was broken. This was a fun experience and I will go to it again in the future.   TIP: go to groupon and get a deal on tickets to this place to save some money"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill since a few years ago. We got there early as suggested, and our food came pretty quickly. Although, my husband was finished his food before receiving our drinks. We had to ask 3 different times for our drinks. Also, our check was dropped before everyone else's and it was the wrong, $20 more than ours. Hmmm. I worked in the service industry long enough to know that trick. Seems like corporate needs to send in someone to clean house. Such a shame. Used to be our favorite place to dinner and a movie."}
{"text":"The concept is great, however the horrid food puts a big hole in this whole concept.  We ordered an App sampler. The potato skins taste like they came straight from the freezer aisle at the grocery store. The chicken tenders were chewy, like rubber. The chicken was only edible if doused in ranch, which came in a super small cup and only lasted for about one piece. The only thing remotely edible was the burger bites. From reading reviews here, the general consensus says to stay away from anything that touches the fryer (a large portion of the menu).  HOWEVER, it is not ALL bad. I loved the fact they had reserved seating. We could hang out in the bar (but still wouldn't buy a $12 drink) while waiitng for the movie without having to worry where I was going to sit. The chairs were amazingly comfortable. They did have those infamous rolly chairs in front of us, I probably would have knocked the review down to one star if I sat in those!  The service was also really good. The servers do a good job of not being obtrusive to anyone. Drink refills came and the order was taken promptly.  One additional complaint, the theater isn't angled. If someone is sitting in the rolling chair in front of you their head blockes the screen. This is the only advantage I could see to taking the rolling chair.  All-in-all I would consider coming again, maybe just getting the desert though. How can you mess up ice cream?"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and food was excellent. Our waitress Atalia was SUPERB!!! Pleasant,  kind and attentive. I will come back just for her. She's an asset to your organization."}
{"text":"Long gone are the days of a new, shiny theater. Here are the days of a worn down, but newly claimed movie house serving food and drinks to your seat.  I was under the assumption that when new owners take over they also fix up the place. I was pretty disappointed that the atmosphere really showed its wear and tear from the last few years.   The seats themselves, however, are still just as comfy as before. Each seat is a good one and still a big bonus that they are assigned. Whew, the anxiety of finding a seat in a packed theater doesn't exist here.  While I think it's a good concept to eat and watch a movie (since I often practice this at home), there were times I would get distracted by the servers running up and down the aisles (not for lack of an intense movie). Minimal distractions though and not enough to prevent me from returning.   I'll have to give it another go, but it definitely wasn't as appealing and shiny when I first came here (when it was the Epicentre Theaters)."}
{"text":"Staff was real freak fly. The food and drinks tasted great. You hardly even noticed them bring things out to other customers. The only thing I didn't like was the seats. The were ok but I was expecting the lounge chairs to have a foot rest or be a little softer. The computer chairs did not look any more comfortable than the ones I have to sit in a work. Not really what I would enjoy to sit on for a couple of hours. But over all it was a great experiences and I would go again. Dessert was good."}
{"text":"Food isn't great, management isn't great, the groupons that they offer never work when you want to go. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Walked out of the movie because it was impossible to watch with an entire row of unsupervised children being out of their seats and talking the entire time.  When we confronted the staff they said that they made an exception because the children were supervised - which they clearly weren't.  Mediocre food, with limited beer selection.   Rolling office chairs for seating - not the best."}
{"text":"Nice theater with comfortable oversized seats and wait service for food and drinks. Would have given it 4 stars, but as a frequent customer, am tired of surprises on the restaurant side. Literally, they now \"nickel and dime\" their customers without conscience, like only giving a very small amount of salad dressing and charging for additional. It seems like every time I go, management has devised some new plan to charge hidden fees for items normally served at no charge at mist restaurants.   On my last visit, the server told me she would speak to the manager to remove some of these unexpected, surprise changes that increased my bill. But, another server returned my credit card and said, \"We went ahead and charged your card for the entire amount. If you don't like it, talk to a manager.\" They did this WITHOUT my permission. So, for my tip to this snooty server, I left her a note to talk to her manager about getting a tip! (Seriously, their attitude is we are there to serve their needs.)  Since we travel 30 minutes to get to SMG, and because there seems to be some \"new\" policy every time we're there, we will not be returning. Instead, we will patronize Fat Cats in Gilbert, a newer theater which has oversized leather RECLINING chairs, and also delivers your food (which is way better & more reasonably priced) to you in the theater. (They also have a bowling alley, glow-in-the-dark putt putt golf, a restaurant, and arcade games, if you feel like continuing the fun.)    If I ever return to SMG, it will ONLY be for the movie, NOT the food."}
{"text":"The trays attached to each seat squeaked loudly every time they were moved. I could hear it whenever someone got up and then came back to their seat during the movie, which was, of course, a terrible distraction throughout the movie.   The servers in my theater were unenthusiastic at best and one was downright unpleasant. I ordered a bottle of water and a cocktail and it took 20 minutes to get them. The couple next to me ordered a full meal at about the same time and were served before I was.   I definitely won't be returning to this theater any time soon."}
{"text":"The food is NASTY. The servers are rude. Please do not use your credit card here either. The only reason I go is because I have so many Groupons to go for half price and you can pick your seats. The servers act like they can be doing something else. Most of the time your order will be wrong. Be prepared for that. Just all around an irritating experience....and a dirty movie theater."}
{"text":"It's sad how an establishment can be so simple minded and racial , I understand the CIAA is a big money maker but this menu is unacceptable....I will no longer be returning to this establishment"}
{"text":"Given the similarities in concept, it's difficult to avoid comparisons to Cinebarre. But hey, that's capitalism! And well, this place is kind of a mixed bag. In some aspects, they're the best in the business. In others, they're screwing up big-time and could really learn a thing or two from their competition. Fortunately, their shortcomings can be avoided, or at least minimized, by following two tips.  1. Go when it's less likely to be busy, thus insuring a seat far from other diner-cum-audience members. Good advice at any cinema, but even more important here.  2. Give the wait staff as little reason to come bother you as possible.  Yes, I said \"bother you\" and I choose my words carefully. Studio Movie Grill's biggest problem is the indiscreet, heavy-handed service of the waiters. They bustle about bringing this and that, reaching over you to hand food and drinks to the person sat beside you. They seem to have developed a skill of coming around right at key points in movies. Worst of all, they bring the check and attempt to settle up during the last quarter of the movie, i.e. the climax. I understand why they do it but there has to be a better way. I for one, would happily stay during the credits to avoid having a movie ruined by oafish service. I don't know the solution to this problem, but Cinebarre certainly seems to have figured it out. They're like ninjas over there; your food or drinks seem to materialize out of the ether. SMG should really take notes.  Where Studio Movie Grill excels is in the comfort department. Their seats are the most luxurious in the business. Not only do they recline, but unlike Cinebarre, where you have to lean way forward to eat from the narrow table too far in front of you, at SMG the table is attached to your seat and swivels right over your lap or completely out of the way as the need arises.   As with their Arboretum competition, the selection of movies is small and limited to big blockbuster Hollywood films. So you're unlikely to ever see that quirky new Wes Anderson film or a screening of Metropolis there. But that's okay. That's what Manor Theater is for."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of SMG and I like its more relaxed atmosphere over iPic.    There are a couple of issues I have with the way it is set up for a movie going experience.  I find it odd that the counter seats are not much lower than the normal seats (with the desk like trays), so if you want to sit in a normal chair, you are inevitably going to be looking at the back of someone's head on the lower part of the screen.  The design could have been much better.  I still choose to go here so when I see a movie opening day, I dont have to get to the theater two hours early.  Our servers seemed quite annoyed every time we needed something though.  I thought that was the point.  I dont like feeling like I am a bother when these are the services that I am paying for.  Additionally, the bartender outside the theater was just plain bad.  She wouldnt make eye contact with us, and when there were only 6 other people at the bar it took her 15 minutes to get over to us.  However, all in all I like the cleanliness of the theater, the services it offers, and generally have a good experience. I know there is not much that can be done about the questionable seating in the theater, it is just something to be aware of."}
{"text":"I like the concept, and I think it's done decently, but I can't give above two stars because the bathrooms here were probably some of the filthiest I've seen in a movie theater. I mean, seriously, send someone in to check it out every now and then throughout the day. There was toilet paper all over the floor, and someone had spilled an entire salad on the floor in the first stall. I'll give it another shot, but that was a real turn-off. I really wanted to like this place, but I just think it needs some work. Hard not to compare it to iPic, which, while it is much more pricey, knows how to pull off the same concept."}
{"text":"Came hungry, left hungry.  Never received order.  Beautiful setting, terrible service.  I highly recommend that you stay far, far away."}
{"text":"We've been around scottsdale to compare theaters and honestly was we were really unhappy with this place. We came for a matinee a couple weekends ago and when choosing seats they told us where the seats were and where the screen was. What we weren't told was that we would literally be sitting in cheap swivel chairs in the first four rows. We understood it was a busy movie, but every other dine in movie theater I've been to has the recline/leather chairs throughout the theater. When we got inside the floors were sticky and there was popcorn and food in the crevices of the weird desk/chair combo we were sitting in. It's a smaller theater in general, and most of the employees seemed nice. But....For two hours I heard all of us in the swivel chairs moving around the sticky floor. I don't think we'll be coming back. I would rather pay a high price and be comfortable the whole time."}
{"text":"I went to see Nonstop today with my husband. It was a great experience! The food is amazing and well worth the money. The seats are comfortable and big. I will definitely be returning back."}
{"text":"OK, first of all, this is not just another theatre so one cannot expect the same feel/ambience/comfort/etc like you would get in a regular movie theatre, I mean you could in a perfect work but hey whom are we kidding.  Its a movie theatre where they also serve food ( oh I thought alcohol was part of food).  My wife and I are super fans of SMG, been going here since 2011, when we paid full prices for movie tickets and parking fees to park inside the epicenter building.  Oh now?, now we groupon and you get $5 ticket to watch movie from Monday to Friday till 5pm I guess, basically weekends groupons not accepted, and parking is free for 4 hours when you get the parking ticket validated at the movie ticket counter.  I personally see that as a steal, free parking in uptown!!! Screens are smaller in size when compared to AMC, sound effect is good enough, seats are pretty good with tiny food tables attached to each seat arm rest, but no recliners though. We always loved the food here, coconut tenders, grilled southern chicken salad, chicken bbq pizza, brownie with ice cream and cinnamon chips are some of our favorites.  Price are ok, not too cheap.  Service is hit or miss, sometimes they are super fast and 0 errors in orders but at times, they just get on your nerves.  but hey its not a regular restaurant to post regular complaints. overall, wife and I love this place and we are gonna just keep going!!!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. I went too see a movie at 10 in the evening. The theater was nearly empty with only 3 other people in the theater yet we were very slow getting the drinks we ordered. About 20 minutes passed by before we got our water and Sierra Mist. The soda was over priced at 4 dollars. We had ordered the 25 dollar deal that included an appetizer and 2 entrees. We were very slow getting the appetizer. About an hour and a half passed and we still had not received the entrees we ordered. Yet the server gave us the bill that included items we did not receive. She was aware that we did not receive our food yet tried to charge us anyway. I had to complain to her to have the items taken off my ticket. I only recommend this theater if you just use a Groupon and DON'T buy food. Otherwise I recommend Cinemark Movie Bistro instead. You'll actually get your food at this theater. I'd give this theatre zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at SMG. The service was attentive, the venue is cool & hip, the chairs are comfy and the screens are big!   I thought the venue was awesome. I love how you can get your tickets and grab a drink and hangout before your movie starts-- or after your movie ends. This would be a GREAT place for date night.  Their comfy seats in the theater even have the arm rest that comes up in the middle of your two seats-- so it kind of make a little love seat.    The service also earns 4 stars. While the staff is still learning the ropes, you can tell they really want your night to be special.  They were nice, attentive and helpful. Every time I pressed the button for service, I was greeted within 2 minutes. I love that you don't have to get up during the movie for food or anything.   Their house margaritas were awesome - the right amount of sweet, tart and alcohol-- which seems to be hard for a lot of restaurants to master. I also noticed on the menu that a lot of 'skinny' beverages are offered which is really nice to see.     Now let's get down to business, the food! I really thought the food would be sub-par, but I am happy to admit I was wrong. My favorite dish of the night was probably their pizzas -- those were great.  Fresh ingredients, really good cheese and awesome thin crust. You could order that for your meal and leave not feeling disgusting.    The sweet potato fries were just as good as Bad Daddy's or Cowfish.  The burgers were also good with a good variety. I ordered the Gouda Bacon and was not disappointed. SMG didn't skimp on the Gouda and the onion, tomatoes and lettuce tasted super fresh.  I also have to put a spotlight on the coconut chicken tenders-- those were SO good.   To top of the night, I order a Frozen Hot Chocolate. I tried to eat only half, but that proved to be impossible.  Order this, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service here has always been slow and unfriendly, and with watered down drinks and warm beer, no reason to order anything from the bar. I've had mixed experiences with the food. However, it's usually always good for a movie right?  Wrong!!!  Last week we saw a movie in theater 3 and had to sit through the first half with an extremely loud distorted blown speaker rattling and buzzing. During the end of the movie, they just totally cut the surround off and it was like watching a normal TV in \"stereo\" mode. When I asked a manager about it, his reply was actually that they knew about it, it's been like that for months, and there's nothing they can do!  Well then why are you keeping that room open and still charging people for your Studio Movie Grill Experience!!! This so called manager wouldn't last a second in my business. Any of my GMs would have fired him on the spot. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place! We went on a Tuesday night and had our choice of seats. We definitely liked the bigger seats with tray tables and not the office chairs at the counters. The have special discount pricing on Tuesdays so that was a nice surprise. The service was good, they were all friendly and it was pretty prompt. The movie was a bit louder than average, but it does mask the sounds of eating and ordering etc. The food was average, nothing outstanding but nothing to complain about either. We saw a 3D movie and it was a great experience for our family! We would go back here again, for sure!"}
{"text":"If you're going to use your Groupon for a movie and a soda for $6 it's a great deal. If you don't make it in and the Groupon expires...you're screwed because SMG violates Groupon's policy.   It clearly states it can be used towards any goods or services after the promotional value has expired, if you contact Groupon they will tell you the exact same thing. If SMG refuses to accept your expired voucher for ANY GOODS OR SERVICES, contact Groupon and they will refund your money."}
{"text":"My husband and I along with just about everyone else went to SMG because of the complimentary passes. I liked theater alot. It was spacious and clean. We sat in the large seats which felt a little cozy. No, the seat didn't recline or rock, but I don't need it too. I ordered the burger with fries. Okay, the patty was a little small for the bun, but it tasted good. I received a combo of sweet potato fries & regular fries. That wouldn't been fine if that's what I'd ordered. The food was good nonetheless. My husband got a basket of popcorn, and they gave him alot. It wasn't a bad experience. The only negative thing I have to say is this, when the food comes it's so bloody dark in there you cannot tell if it's what you ordered until you start eating it. We have 2 more passes so we'll go back next. If it weren't for the free passes we wouldn't be going back so soon. I do like the idea of sipping a little wine while I watch a movie.   We went back last week and the angus burger which knocked our socks off! I've added an extra star for the outstanding burgers and fries."}
{"text":"The movie was great but the food was HORRIBLE! Over priced food for no reason at all. Don't recommend you spend money on food here. I got the Mahi Tahi with chips and felt like I ordered a bowl of grease."}
{"text":"We always love coming here. Service is usually pretty good. The food is pretty tasty. We always get the fajita quesadilla. That seems to be one of the best thing on the menu. The price is super reasonable if you get it on Groupon."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot - my husband and I get $6 groupons and go whenever there is a movie out we want to see. The chairs are really comfortable - although I usually like to sit at the counter seats because sometimes it is hard to see otherwise if someone tall sits in front of you. The food is just ok - usually we eat first - but we love catching movies and a few drinks here! :) Especially for $6 - cant beat it!"}
{"text":"Worst popcorn I've ever had. There was so much popcorn salt it was inedible.   Also there were so many unpopped kernels. There is too much lighting during movie. They should use red lights like Alamo Draft House."}
{"text":"We came here to \"experience\" a dine in movie theatre... The theater it's self was very interesting. There are rows of seats that have trays that pull in front of you and then there are office style roller chairs that sit at a counter.... It was so odd! Since I had bought my tickets on Fandango, I had no idea I had purchased the \"counter\" seats with office chairs... I went and spoke to a manager, I didn't want to sit at a desk! They switched our seats to the movie style seats with the trays. At the bottom of the theatre... (Looking up for 2.5 hours :( )   So we sit down and press the service button. The service was great, they all have fun sweet personalities. The food however was , meh, at best. The coconut tenders with Thai chili sauce (the most popular menu item?) were boring and bland. The pizza reminded me of Digiorno, which is great if you like that, but at a place that serves food I expected a tastier, more thought out pizza. The kids meal, quesadilla, was a good size for $6 and my older kid liked the California burger. They have good steak fries.   All in all, to experience this once is great! I wouldn't go back, the food was junk and the seating is strange. I'm hoping AMC Esplanade is better, we will try that next!"}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is the poor man's iPic, but at a similar price, it is a better option than a Harkins just because of the nicer, reserved seating (recliners, but not super cozy) and the option to drink booze and order food from a server from your seat. That being said, don't eat the food. The menu is very basic as is the actual food. I've had a turkey burger and a quesadilla and was quite unimpressed. They seem to always have a Groupon or Living Social deal going, but even without, it is a good value."}
{"text":"Good idea, but horrible execution. 1st thing that I don't understand is the bar they have in the lobby. That sounds perfect lets get people drunk and then send them into a quiet theater. People in a theater are usually inconsiderate when they aren't liquored up, add in alcohol and you might as well stay at home with all the loud talking.   The theater itself is very strange. There is reserved seating which consists of leather chairs. They are extremely rough and are horrible. If you don't get one of faux leather chairs, the rest are office chairs with rollers, so tacky and so cheap..  The tables used for holding the food are cheap Formica counter tops.   And then there is the food and service. I don't understand why someone would go to a theater and pay 12 bucks for a crappy burger and sit in an office chair for 2 hrs. What's even more annoying are the servers who keep coming and going throughout the whole movie. They try to be quiet but the people ordering don't whisper and the servers keep getting in the way of the movie . So distracting..  Bottom line if you are impressed with bar food and like to be constantly distracted during the movie in an office like setting this is the place for you."}
{"text":"need some improvements but the food is very yummy. And MOST of the staff are professorial. I had issues using my Groupon."}
{"text":"I went again.  I will continue to go.  Until I am proven wrong, however, I will not expect my food or drinks to come...ever.  lol.  I also give it 3 stars because the staff is always very friendly and the building itself is very nice.  the seats are big and comfy and the ladies' room is clean. Theater is always clean and the picture/sound quality is good.  Mostly impressed with the friendly staff! The movie price is good and the menu is reasonably priced too.   My complaint is always simply slow service, and i only put the review here, hoping that perhaps the system can be corrected in the future because i really like going there!   There were 3 people in the theater including myself, but it took 30 minutes to receive my soda, and over 45 to get my food. After asking about the food twice and finally getting up from the movie to go out and ask where it was, I received it, and I was happy with the way that it was handled. I will return and when something changes between the kitchen and the theater, i will surely raise my stars."}
{"text":"Honestly, hit or miss. There's no perfect in-between. I've been going to this location for about 2 years now because I can conveniently walk here from my house and they ALWAYS have Groupons (who doesn't like a $5 movie?!), but the service and food is a swinging pendulum.   If I have a good experience one visit, the chances of that happening back-to-back is slim.   Don't come here with high hopes... but when you do have a good experience it's not a bad place to go... if it wasn't for the convenience I would always pick AMC22 over SMG."}
{"text":"Its great to go here with my daughter...  i love the dine in experience and having a glass of wine while i endure hours of disney movies..... i dont understand the office chairs... i often feel like I am at a corporate conference and not a luxury theater"}
{"text":"My husband and I have always enjoyed our time at this theater for the following reasons;  1) The chairs are comfy and relaxing.  2) The staff is always helpful and comes by to take your order before the movie starts and drops off a check about 20 minutes before the movie ends. Very minor distraction. 3) The food is great! However, we have only had their coconut chicken tenders (YUM) and their nachos. PLUS, the price is very affordable!! For 25 bucks you can get an appetizer and two dinner entrees. Count us in!!  4) The theater has never been too cold. We are always very comfortable in the theater.  5) They give you mints at the end of the movie as you walk out.   Great place and great price!!"}
{"text":"Projector was horribly out of focus(we do screening rooms for a living so it's not that I forgot my glasses)) - notified the server who sent the manager over - told him the same thing and as assured they would address it.   Watched the whole movie out of focus - will not return."}
{"text":"There's been a lot of groupons for SMG lately, $5 for a movie and a soft drink? Now that's a great deal!  Tip: Arrive to your movie at least 30-40 minutes prior to the show. This is so you can have a choice in seating. There are comfy la-z-boy type seats with sliding table tops (large lecture hall style desks) and then there are office chairs placed way too close together over a long table top (diner style counter top). I prefer the comfy la-z-boy's and to use the groupon, you just have to arrive early in order to get in the front of the line.   If you don't want to arrive early, I suggest purchasing tickets online ($11) and then adding $1 to have reserved seating.   Please note - SMG staff starts lining movie patrons up about 15 minutes prior to the show and it's kind of like a mad dash run. Everyone wants to get in line first!   Once you're seated, there are lots of SMG waiters/waitresses awaiting your food orders. Considering this is the movies, and refreshments cost an arm and a leg, I believe the pricing of the food is reasonable. A pizza for $10, A burger + fries for $10 etc. I've only tried the white chocolate macademia cookies with vanilla ice cream = ~$5-6, and I've had cookies that were so soft, fresh, and delicious, but the other time I got cookies that were hard, and a little burnt.  Ps. There's cocktails! - I ought to try one of those next time :)"}
{"text":"A fun new way to watch a movie. Expecially for adults. Nice menu and cocktail options. Customer service lacking in the bar area. Before movie, while ordering our drinks the bartender seemed extremely slow-moving. Didn't seem to enjoy her job at all. Was very unattentive and snappy after I'd placed my order. Extremely unhelpful, rude, and unprofessional! Beer was flat too. Bummer! Ruined my experience before I even got into the theatre."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Flat soda.  So-so food and seating.  AMC dine-in at Esplanade or iPic are much better options.  Not unique to SMG, I always wonder why so many theaters chose to put the most sullen, unpleasant teenager they can at the ticket check.  Is that really the first impression you want to make?  The walking darkness manning SMG's entry way literally did not speak to my daughter (9) and I (or make eye contact or smile or otherwise suggest that he was a live person).  Good thing the board behind him showed where we needed to go.  Definitely a good candidate for automation... a turnstile w a QR code reader would definitely be a better customer experience.    Then there was the in-seat service.  First, our service call button/light did not work.   Our neighbor was good enough to use hers to flag a server down after a few ignored manual attempts on our part.   Our server then proceeded to talk over me (literally raising his voice bit by bit until I stopped). as I explained that our button was malfunctioning.  Rushed, but robotically polite, he impatiently prompted at my 9 yr old to make a decision.   Then, as if to emphasize how much he didn't give a damn about it, he walks away saying \"if you need anything just push your button\" and ignored me as I tried to point out again that the button doesn't work... awesome.  If I wasn't taking my daughter to the incredibles 2, I'd have been gone right there.  Riding it out, we had simple snack food and sodas (pretty flat).  My daughter ordered the pretzels which came out very quickly.  Neither the pretzels nor the cheese sauce were hot... but honestly?  salty snack bar food isn't terrible lukewarm.    We sat in the forward facing portion of the row (table in front).  Seats (F5-6) were basically rolling conference room chairs... reasonably comfy but stuffed way too close together such that you can't get in/out without disrupting neighbors."}
{"text":"OK, Where do I start?  This place is AMAZING! I love the food here, especially the fact that you can eat and watch a movie at the same time! Forget about the movie theater popcorn, you can get a rack of ribs here while enjoying your movie!  Before the movie starts, a waiter walks around with an iPod touch taking your order, usually during the previews. During the movie, you can press the Service Light to add more things to your order. About nearing the end of the movie, you will get your check, so make sure that if you want more food, get your orders in before the movie is over.  Pricing is good, it costs about the same as  a dinner and a movie separately, why NOT kill two birds with one stone and get it all at once? The seats are REAL COMFORTABLE, as long as you get the love seat, or leather seats, just don't get the \"office chair\" seats, as those are like....sitting in an office chair for 3 hours watching a movie ;)."}
{"text":"Went with my daughter to see a movie and it was a fantastic experience! Just fantastic! Gone were the millions of worthless candy choices that nobody wants and instead you can order great food and drinks! The waiters and staff were the BEST! I felt I had been congratulated for coming to see a movie instead of burned. HATS OFF! I hope SMG makes the old dreary movie theaters go away for good."}
{"text":"Although the audio and video were ok, it's a small theatre with office chairs as your luxury seating. There are other chairs that look like leather recliners but I didn't see not one recline. Their trays squeak as you move them as well. Not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Hubby instantly sat at the bar, hit up foosball talk with the bartender and ordered a San Tan Brewery Ale.  My little cutie pie and I decided to sit in their comfy lounge where a birthday party was taking place.  Inside the theater smelled of food instead of popcorn, which I had to get used to.   We picked the comfy and stationary leather chair and a swivel desk with a red service button.  Make sure you look over the menu first so you could put in your food order right when the wait person comes around.  If you wait too long, like we did, the people who ordered straightaway got their food first before they came around for our orders.  They did not get in the way of the movie at all.  We got the sliders, chicken strips with fries and milkshakes.  It's no gastro pub, but it was pretty good!  We'd go back more often if it didn't take us almost an hour drive to get there."}
{"text":"Nice concept.  Hard to get good service.  Theater is large and roomy.  Staff is not pleasant.   Needs better management."}
{"text":"Experienced this place for the first time last night and had a great time. They had a nice Valentine's Day dinner special but we opted for the all you can eat pizza since they offer that on Wednesdays and my husband and I are pizza junkies. Plenty of parking available here, a bar in the lobby area to grab a drink before your movie and the theaters are clean and have a nice setup.  I saw a sign about restricting the movie theater attendees by age so don't try to bring your child to a PG-13 or R rated movie... nice touch as far as I'm concerned because an un-entertained kid in a movie takes the enjoyment totally out of it for me.  Like other places similar to this offering food and drink service in the theater; everyone has a button to press for service. Service is quick and staff is friendly. We'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is an awesome place to watch a movie for a couple of reasons.  Most importantly, you can go online and reserve your (very comfortable) seats.  No more having scrambling to find seats together or developing a crick in your neck because you got there late and there's only seats in the front left.  Do yourself a favor and reserve your seats BEFORE you go - then, just pick up your tickets from the machines in the lobby and proceed directly to your theatre.    If you are planning on ordering food, plan to arrive 15 or so minutes early.  This gives you time to get your order in before the lights start to dim.  It's next to impossible to read the menu once the movie begins - and, no one wants to see your phone on during the movie as you try to see the menu."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first experience at Studio Movie Grill. Very modern looking theatre/bar/restrurant concept. The moment you walk in the spacious room that has a self check in kiosk, customer friendly check in counter, plush seats in the waiting area and a lively bar to dine at.   Once you grab your ticket and walk to your assigned room your immediatly greeted by a person who works there. Your given directions on where you need to go along with a menu. The area where my movie was playing passed by the kitchen area which the floor was a little slippery. Once in my assigned movie room there was a person there to greet me. I found my seat which I was not to found of. My black fake leather chair was missing cusihion on both arms. The totally used chair kind of reminded me of a uncomfortable chair you would use at work. It was not the most comfortable experience. I will say there were seats against the back wall in the last row that seemed to be more comfortable. The table infornt of me was spacious. The red button to push for service worked well. Incomparison to AMC dining theatre Studio Movie Grill has fast friendly service. You don't have to wait long and there is plenty of staff. There are plenty of food options to choose from from children size to adult. Prices are very responable and the food is good.   I would say over all the place is very nice and clean. Even the tempature of the room was perfect. The only issue I had was the comfortablity of the chair I had to sit in. If I come again I will be sure to get a seat agains the back wall."}
{"text":"I was here last night with some friends to see Twilight. I mean I had free movie passes so why not right? I remember when it was the old movie theater so the changes they made were a HUGE improvement. When you walk in, it is a little confusing because all the lines say will-call. Luckily there was no one in line so I just walked up as I wasn't sure where to go. She gave us our ticket as well as menus to look over what we may want to order while enjoying our movie. Wow what a menu it is. The funny thing is all I wanted was popcorn and I had to search high and low to find it lol. It was literally the last line on the opposite side of the menu.   So we go to the theater and like others have stated it is a weird set up. Luckily for us we didn't have to be herded in like others have experienced as it was pretty empty at 5pm. We picked our seats, which were the ones that had the trays in front of us. Not the weird rolling work chairs in which it looks like you are sitting at desk. That is way weird indeed.  We got comfy and pressed our button to order some food. My friend Toni ordered the kahlua mudslide and some sweet potato fries and I ordered a diet pepsi and some popcorn. OMG the popcorn was so good. It served in a basket with  side butter. It has to be a large because I swear it was never ending. My other girlfriend even was able to nosh on it and still we didn't finish it. My friend's drink was huge and she said her sweet potato fries were pretty good. I don't like the fact that the lights under those weird desk stay on the entire time. That along with people constantly walking in front of you to drop off orders or to take them was a little annoying. But I will say that the staff was very friendly and attentive.  Overall it is ok. I have not been to IPIC or Ultrastar so I have nothing to compare this too but it wasn't bad, just ok. I might give a try again after I check the others but we will see."}
{"text":"First time here with my wife and a couple friends... we live all the way in Gilbert, so I had pretty high expectations to make this worth the drive.   I have to say that the prices are pretty good... in terms of tickets, it's just the same as anywhere else... in terms of food, it's on par with a Chili's or Applebee's (prices, that is).   No problems with the \"office chairs\" that everyone seems to be upset about... honestly, what theater are you all going to that have such great seats? You make it sound like SMG gives you a couple of concrete blocks. They're fine. Parking is adequate, easy in and out from the 101.   Chicken strips are what my wife and I went with... both good. Fries - both regular and sweet potato - are below average and not even room temp. Drinks are fairly priced.   Something to take advantage of... each night they have specials, both food and drink, that are on the front menu cover. Can't believe I missed the stuff on the COVER, but I did and I missed out on $5 Tito's vodka drinks. For two people, there's also a pretty good deal for $25: 1 appetizer, 2 entrees... and you can add a dessert for $5. Not bad when you compare it to other food places.  I'd recommend it and will probably go back."}
{"text":"We love coming here because you can do dinner & a movie all in one sitting!  They have 2 seat choices either office chairs at a counter or loveseats with a tray.  The loveseats are super comfy! The service has always been great- just push the red button & they are there.  Free refills on beverages (non alcoholic).  The food is good but not fancy.  A lot of fried items but its done well."}
{"text":"Seriously the most uncomfortable movie seat...and not just the desk chairs. Also disappointed with the their popcorn. I'm all about popcorn when I see a movie. I asked for very little butter when she asked if I wanted butter. It came to me drenched in butter. I hit the red light and asked them for popcorn with no butter.... it came back drenched in butter again. Not a relaxing or enjoyable experience. The only good thing was the movie."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite movie theaters. Order food and drinks from your seat, great customer service. Theatre has great sound and picture, so an overall great movie experience"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited an hour into the movie to receive my drink that I ordered before the movie started. The manager seemed to care less. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Pros: Service is on the spot, seats are reserved, seats and aisles are spaced out nicely, tickets are cheap  Cons: Seats don't recline. They nickel and dime you on their menu. I was surprised to find out they charge extra for extra dips that were requested with chicken tenders. With the price of their food already, it seemed a bit ridiculous. Also, be sure to read the fine print on their menu. I ordered a mimosa thinking it was $6 only to find out later on they were $8.50 because I ordered after 2pm. Nowhere else in the menu are mimosas priced at $8.50. We did the 2/$30 deal without a dessert. The receipt read  2/$25 or $30. I asked about this and was told it was an old promo deal that didn't get fixed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Ive only been here 2 times and each time I really liked it here. They have fast service, popcorn (with or without) is really good. They have milkshakes here. I only rated to 4 stars because I think Ipic is still a bit better because of the reclining seats. Go to Studio Movie Grill and see for yourself how great their service is. Thanks for reading my review on Studio Movie Grill."}
{"text":"Don't buy the groupon!  I was interested in going to this place so I purchased a groupon for half off tickets, but then SMG charged me an additional $19 on top of my groupon!!! An additional $8 per ticket because the movie was 3D?? Plus another stupid $3 fee just for doing it online! HIGHWAY ROBBERY!!! They literally tripled their revenue out of me, and If I had known. I would have never bought the groupon in the first place and just went to AMC instead!!!!"}
{"text":"Great movies(new releases)...good seating(get there early so you can select you seat)...good food and drinks...what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place is great! Definitely sit in the a or b seats. We saw Jurassic World and the quality of the movie was great, service was good. They never brought my boyfriends water and that's why they didn't earn 5 stars but the ambience of this place is great! Try the Long Island, had a great buzz through the movie, and they're only $5 on Tuesdays!!! Price: very reasonable Food: only had the popcorn but it was good Drinks: delicious Movie quality: A+ Service: A. Waiters are nice, curious and care about your experience.  I would definitely recommend!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place more stars since we come here so often and the seating is so spacious and the sound is so awesome but.....the bathroom  (insert sad face) There were plenty of staff so that wasn't the problem but the ladies bathroom was an absolute mess and to top it off the toilet paper dispenser fell off when I trying to use it to line the seat ..... Alley enjoys the friendly staff and the comfortable floor, as well as her view of the screen from any seat in the house."}
{"text":"The service was awesome, the food was delicious and fast, I will definitely be back. I appreciate that the price tag isn't as high as iPic, but the accommodations aren't nearly as posh or plush, so expect to get what you pay for. The seats are comfortable and this is a nice treat for something new and different to take the kids or a date night."}
{"text":"I have been several times now to see movies here, and it is by far the best movie experience out there. The food is decent for the price, and the service is mostly great, but has issues when really packed. I give them a break on that since it was crazy the one time we had so so service. The seats are very comfortable. I recommend reserving for fisrt weekend premiers and using groupons for second week showings. Where else can you order a bottle of wine or pitcher of beer, even mixed drinks. We even took my parents in their 60's and they said it was the best movie experience they've had. They said they would drive from Anthem again passing up like6 theatres just to go there."}
{"text":"What a cool concept! A restaurant in a movie theater. I found a groupon for $5 movie tickets so Hubs and I made it a date night. It's located in the epicentre and the interior is pretty cool. They have a full service bar you can hang out at with couches while you wait for your theater to be ready. Once you're inside the theater, you get some menus and push a button on your tray table when you're ready to order.   The seats are comfy and service is decent. The food is mediocre like pub food, but they work hard and it fills you up. My favorite part was the \"adult\" milkshake I got. I could've had 5! The theaters were clean and everyone is busy eating and drinking so no one is really talking. Only thing is if there's a specific movie you want to see, get there early. They sell out quickly and the theaters aren't as big as typical theaters. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time here."}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill features a nicely designed, clean theater, great service, and well made cocktails, but could improve with food quality & seat comfort.  I visited Studio Movie Grill for the first time recently to see Logan Lucky. Having pre-purchased my ticket online, I printed my ticket from one of the several kiosks available to use in the main lobby, but there was also a box office available for those wanting to work directly with an employee.   When I went to my theater, I was greeted by a hostess who provided me with a menu and directed me to my theater for the evening. Once inside the theater, all seats are numbered and reserved. There are two kinds of seating options at this location. A long counter lined with large office chairs, or larger recliner style chairs (they don't recline, just slight recline of seat back) fitted with a small moveable table. While the seat I was in for the evening (recliner) wasn't uncomfortable, compared to other theaters in the area, it could be much more comfortable.  To drink, I went with a Ruby Red Deep Eddy Vodka & Sprite. Every day of the week, Studio Movie Grill runs a different promotion, and on Thursday, the night I visited, the deal of the day was $5 Deep Eddy cocktails. The drink arrived a few minutes after ordering and was very well made. Smooth and easy to drink, the drink didn't feel too strong nor too weak.  To eat, I went with an order of the pretzel bites and the chicken tenders with fries. The pretzel bites were extremely disappointing. Cold and flavorless, even the honey mustard dipping sauce couldn't save them. The chicken tenders however were quite good. Large tenders, hot fresh out of the fryer with juicy white meat. Although they weren't the best tenders I've had, I would definitely consider ordering these again.  Service before and throughout the film was great. A server was always available shortly after pressing the service button, and never hesitated with any requests thrown at them.  I will definitely be back to Studio Movie Grill again in the future."}
{"text":"Great environment, quick service, and because not a whole lot of people know about it, pretty open seating."}
{"text":"Always a fun place to come watch a movie... big chairs. They don't decline but they are comfortable. The staff is very prompt to take your order and bring your food out."}
{"text":"I went here last night with four other women for a girls night out. I thought they had a nice looking lounge but I noticed that a lot of the furniture was frayed.  The seating... just awful. Most of the seating was a bunch of office chairs sitting at a table with lights to see your plate. Why? Why would I come to a movie to sit in an office chair? I guess it's easier to eat, but not exactly a comfortable way to watch, I would imagine.  My group sat in the very back row, which was at completely the wrong height, it appeared to be lower than the office table seating in front of us. I'm only 5'2\" so I had people's heads in my way of watching the screen. The seats we had were okay, but they didn't recline, which was disappointing. On the swivel tray tables, there is a button you push to call your server, my friend's seat didn't even have one.  I ordered the fishbowl goblet cocktail for $10. It was SO delicious, although it didn't have a Swedish fish like the flyer for it said. There was also a mocktail version that came in a to-go fishbowl. I asked if I could have the cocktail in the to-go bowl and they didn't even have them. I ordered the coconut breaded chicken fingers/shrimp which was $13.50. It would have only been $11 if I had ordered all chicken, and I would have if I had known I was going to get 3 giant chicken fingers and 3 measly little shrimps. They fries that came with it were piping hot, but not very crispy. The little cup of coleslaw was pretty good.  Overall, I was pretty disappointed, I won't be back. I've had far better experiences and far more delicious meals at the AMC Dine-In Theatres."}
{"text":"Went to Studio Movie Grill for the first time on Saturday night with the help of Groupons and enjoyed it very much.  The lobby is attractive and clean.  Everyone is handed a drink and food menu after buying a ticket.  The menu has appetizers, burgers, pizza, quesadillas, chicken tenders - it's similar to food at Chilis.  There is a large selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.  There is a bar in the lobby, but no one was sitting there when I was there.  I'm assuming you can have drinks and food there as well as in the theater.    The theater itself is set up like a dinner theater with the choice of comfy desk-type chairs lined up at a counter or chairs each with a moveable table top.  There is a button at every person's elbow to summon the wait servers.  The staff responds almost instantly to the press of the button and the food and drinks come quickly too.  I had a chicken quesadilla which was delicious.    Now this was weird.  I had a skinny marguerita which was much too strong!  It was like drinking straight alcohol.  The waiter was good-natured and did the best he could to fix it, but it was pretty hopeless.  If you like your drinks strong, you'll get your money's worth here.  Speaking of money, I read reviews that mentioned this was a pricey place.  Yes, the drinks are a few dollars more than usual, but the food and movie price seemed about average to me.  I didn't check out the popcorn.  But I don't feel I spent too much more that usual for movie and a meal.  Plus, the place was a different experience.  I should mention the movie selection.  There are plenty of titles to choose from, including documentaries and movies that would be considered \"arty.\"  And what other movie theater passes out dinner mints on the way out?  One minor complaint - the ladies bathroom could be cleaner.  It looked \"well used\" by 9:00 PM and there were still the late shows left.  By the way, there were no talkers or kids making noises during our movie.  I recommend this place.  I finally found a way to get my husband to a movie - have a beer at the same time."}
{"text":"The actual movie theater was great. Clean, nice and spacious but please take into consideration that food is served and ordered as you watch the movie. I do not recommend going to see a movie that requires much concentration because you will get distracted. The waiters were super friendly but not the most organized... And it showed !! Also the iPad or device they used to take the orders was so bright as they walked around the cinema with it. Very annoying. I will see the movie again just because I felt I missed things. I will say I did not get there until near the time the movie started. Next time I will get there early then hopefully get all of my ordering out of the way before it starts."}
{"text":"NOT GO!!!! I had the WORST experience ever in my life at the EpiCenter SMG. Where do I begin!?! My boyfriend and I get there and the service was awful. She directed us to the wrong movie! Once we finally went to the right one, we sit down and we were given an \"alternate menu\" because of the CIAA weekend. I ask the manager if they were still doing the 2 for $25 for the movie goers and he told me no. I looked all over for a disclaimer or a heads up of the change in menu-my ticket, Instagram, twitter.. Nowhere to be found!! If I had known there was going to be an alternate menu, I wouldn't have come to SMG at that time.   At first we ordered pretzel bites, chicken tenders, and two sweet teas. The food came out (always to the couple next to us.. and they always asked if we \"switched seats;\" as if they didn't know the seat numbers, or something was wrong with their system) and I would describe it as overrated and over priced, but the food came out in a timely manner. We watched others get their orders taken and they got their food and drinks. My boyfriend asked 3 servers, who, were LESS THAN helpful AND pleasant, and we waited at least 40-45 minutes for our sweet teas. By the way, my personal service button was broken, but I digress. The excuse that they gave us was that they were slammed because of the club section in the building. I was not convinced not 1% because I worked in the service industry for years and soft beverages like sweet teas and and sodas are the EASIEST and FASTEST things to give to a customer. We get the sweet teas and they were awful!   The movie was way too loud (I'm assuming to cover up the club noise). During the movie I saw servers on the side hanging out (this was when we still didn't have our drinks). At the end, the server showed no courtesy when she collected and dropped off the tickets at the worst possible moments of the movie. All in all our experience was DREADFUL! At this time and based on this experience, my boyfriend and I see no reason to come back and recommend this establishment to any of our friends and co-workers.   We contacted Guest Services and although her response was quick, she gave the worst response no upset customer should hear. She basically said sorry and we will improve our processes. Nothing more. DO NOT GO!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I used to live near a \"Movie Tavern\" which is a far better overall experience. Similar concept.  What is really annoying is how you can not swipe your credit card or order food right from your seat. The great thing about the Movie Tavern is there is tons of room between the seats and the staff rarely block your view. At the studio grill, there is not a ton of room between the rows or seats. I can not really see the Movie Grill removing seats. For me, I hope to one day see Movie Grill enhancing the overal experience.   BTW I see the negative reivews for \"Theater five.\" I saw \"unfinished business\" at theater five and there were not any issues. If there was an issue it has been fixed."}
{"text":"First of all, coconut breaded chicken strips?! If I didn't have to fit into a tight New Years eve dress I would have ordered that, sounds yummy!  When you first walk through the doors you end up in the lobby where you can buy tickets, order drinks and food, eat or drink recently purchased items, and stand in line to enter the movie theater. We decided to order drinks in the lobby and wait to order food until we got into the theater. I order the Skinny tea, which consisted of Firefly Skinny Tea Vodka, Monin sugar sweetener, lemon juice, and splash of pepsi, all promising to be under 100 calories. There is also a Skinny Coloda that my friend got that tastes like a melted pina colada that consists of Ciroc Coconut vodka, pineapple juice, and milk that is supposedly under 100 calories. Both were scrumptious and I was impressed that they offered \"healthier\" choices.  After entering the theater and turning the corner, with my alcoholic beverage in hand, I felt like I was entering a lecture hall the way the seats are layed out. Every other row has a long table (or desk) that stretches across the room and is about three feet in length. There are then comfy black leather office chairs that swivel that are lined up side by side across the room the accompany said desk. The other row  consists of black leather chairs and a small individual airplane tray table-esque table (was that redundant?) that you can swing in front of you once you sat down. There is then a red box with a black button that you push for service and a waiter will come and input your order into a wireless handheld device that sends your order ASAP to the kitchen.   There was a group of five of us. Two ordered buffalo chicken strips and one ordered a philly steak sandwich. My friend and I decided to take advantage of their healthier menu items and split a fruit and cheese platter and a turkey burger. Well, all the fried food came out literally 3 minutes after they were ordered. It got us all wondering how long these items were under the heat lamp, but apparently they were still tasty. The fruit and cheese platter and turkey burger took about 12 minutes to get out, I guess not too many people order these items. The fruit was fresh, but the hunk of cheese that comes with the platter reminds me of the Laughing Cow herb cheese, not really worth the $10. The turkey burger, on the other hand, was delicious, and although it was supposed to be a healthier option, it still came with sweet potato fries that were okay, for $10. The bill was dropped off about 20 minutes before the end of the movie so everything was taken care of and we could leave the theater as soon as the credits started rolling.  I would come back again, but I subtracted a star for all the clanking of dishes and the dropped cups, it was a lot for my ADD to handle in addition to watching the movie."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time or money at this theater.   My boyfriend and myself attended SMG on 11/19/16 for the 7:30pm showing of Almost Christmas.  We arrived to the theater around 7:00 because our ticket stated to arrive 20 mins prior to showing.  Once we got tickets scan to enter the theater we were informed that our theater was not ready yet.  We waited another 15 mins and I went to ask the front hostess was the theater ready yet or will they announce it over the intercom just in case I missed the call.  The hostess then proceeded to tell me that a call will not be made but she can get someone to yell it in the lobby for me because she was not going to do that.  I just smiled at her and went back to the lobby.    We finally are in the theater and placed our orders with no issue.  We ordered food, alcoholic beverages and water.  Our alcoholic beverages come out first with no straws, it takes us about 10 mins to flag down someone to get straws.  After about 30 mins into the movie our food order comes with no silverware or napkins and we still have not received the waters that we ordered.  Our server read the order back to us in the beginning and the waters were on there.  The food preparation was sub par but because of the wait we are just ready to eat.  At this point in the theater there are no waiters are walking around so it takes about 20 mins for someone to acknowledge our light.   The waiter comes and we tell her we need napkins and we never received our waters.  She lets us know that she has no control over waters, which I believe is an irrelevant statement if we are expressing our concerns to you.  She said she would check on it and brought us back some napkins.  Needless to say we never received our waters, my boyfriend had to go to the bar to get the waters himself, which is unacceptable if we asked for something and are being provided a service.  This by far was the worst experience I have had at SMG and after the service that we received we do not plan to return to."}
{"text":"Talk about the worst food I have ever had!!! The service was horrible!!.  I ordered a burger with the gluten free bun.  The bun was hard as a rock and the burger and French fries were cold.  The soda was flat!! There was 4 of us and we all had a bad experience $ 90 later. (NOT WORTH IT AT ALL) All the food came back cold. Very disappointing!! The best part of this experience was the movie. I would not order any food from there..... they definitely need to pay more attention to their kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"1) The food is expensive and NOT good.  2) The manager, Adam, is a complete jackass.  My wallet fall out of my purse while we were in the dark theater.  I had no idea. Less than 20 minutes after leaving the theater for the (FORTH NIGHT IN A ROW) as soon as I realized it, I went back to the theater and explained that my wallet was missing. Adam, the manager refused to check the theater or have a server check the theater. I'm leaving on a trip tomorrow. ALL of my ID (passport, license, etc.) are in my wallet because of my trip. (My dad is sick, which I explained to Adam).  HE REFUSED TO ASSIST ME AND TOLD ME I HAD TO COME BACK AFTER THE MOVIE ENDED. I quote, \"It's a sold out show and I'm not going to interrupt the movie to assist you. You have to come back in two hours and we will check at that time.\"  3) The servers interrupt your meal all night long for drink orders, checks, payment, etc. and yet, they couldn't interrupt ONE PERSON for one minute to check for my wallet.    4) I've taken my family to this theater for the last FOUR NIGHTS IN A ROW spending over +$50 a night.  I'm NOT a one time patron.  I WILL NOT GO BACK-EVER.  I am of the mindset that you treat people like you treat your family.  If I were that manager's mom, he would have gone in and checked for my wallet but he would not do that for a stranger who explained the importance.  I will NEVER go back  again.  Go to Harkins, and save your money for better food and people that care about customers."}
{"text":"Horrible experience from the moment we walked in asking for tickets, the young lady was rude and didn't want to take the time to assist us. Inside, the only delightful or accommodating person we encountered, was the young lady who took our tickets. The server who took our order was condescending and repeatedly referred to me as darlin and sweetheart (not in a typical southern hospitality kind of way). We ordered our food and drinks came right away, and shortly after we got our appetizer, and that was all she wrote. Our entrees came after a solid hour, and both were cold, which tells us they'd been sitting for a while. We requested they correct this, and we never got our entrees within a reasonable amount of time, and the movie was nearing the end. We cancelled the orders altogether at that point. The staff were rude and didn't seem to acknowledge any real issue with our concerns, and asked if we wanted our food to go, since they charged us. The manager was very accommodating and seemed overwhelmed with the amount of customer complaints, that were all like ours. We did get a full refund, and at least the movie was good.   The most disappointing thing was my boyfriend raves about this place and had long wanted to take me. We are from out of town and it was on our list of things to do in Charlotte. My advice, until they revamp the entire place and get rid of staff, build from the ground up, do not go there."}
{"text":"Never thought I would miss Mez, but the SMG really screwed up a great concept. I went recently for a movie date and now I wish I saw it in a theater without so many distractions. I don't think 5 minutes went by without a server walking up to a seat.  Beyond the distractions, the pizza we ordered was less than decent, it was barely cooked.   Going forward I will be grabbing dinner somewhere in Phillips place and seeing a movie there."}
{"text":"Nice place, however, do not buy groupons.  They expire and they tell you that you can use them but you end up paying double.  They continue to change the policy of the groupons.  They rip you off.  I complained to the manager 3 times and he said oh well. Not impressed!"}
{"text":"First time I was here the food was below fast food quality, and the chairs were uncomfortable (they do not recline).  On my second visit, I was never approached by a waiter to order any food or drink, even though he bumped into my chair repeatly...which defeats the entire point of this theater.  Also, when purchasing Fandango tickets, they say you can go right to the ticket taker, however that is not true, they make you go to the ticket counter, wait in that long line...and can only look up tickets with the confirmation code.  Go to any other theater in the area, this one is a dud."}
{"text":"What a great movie house, not only are the tickets the same price as other theaters, but you get to pick your seats.  And they are more than seats, it is a seat with a moveable tray to put food or drinks that can be ordered anytime during the movie. You hardly know that there are others around you. The food is good and everyone who works there is very friendly and helpful. And even with all this eating and drinking going on, the place is clean. Great concept and great execution. It is a drive from my place, but for a special time or movie, I will gladly drive to the Studio Movie Grill."}
{"text":"I took my granddaughter to this place last Sunday. THERE WERE ONLY 13 PEOPLE (including we two) at the movie, 4 of which had already received their food. We ordered meals while the lights were on. Waited for our meals thru the previews, and 10 minutes into the movie, we signaled the waitress and asked where our meals were. 5 minutes later the meals were brought out in the pitch dark. I could not see what constituted my meal as was too dark. Ate some finger food and went for a napkin....no napkin....signaled the waitress and asked for a napkin. Ate some more and found that I had a small salad. No silverware.... so had to signal the waitress again, for silverware which she brought. The shish-kabob chicken WAS COLD!...Afterward ordered dessert cookies. After at least 15 minutes or more, had to signal the waitress inquiring where were the cookies. She stated that she would get them and warm them up for us..Near the end of movie and still in the dark, the bill was brought and the waitress stood next to me waiting. Pitch black and I told the waitress that I wanted to see the bill so that I knew what to pay here, and that I would pay later when the lights came back on.(No flashlight to show me the bill) She left. I wrote all that had happened on the back of the bill when we left, I advised the manager of the lousy service and poor food. When I suggested that this was bad PR for their establishment and suggested that she show what I had written to the waitress she replied \"Oh, I would never show that to her!\" She said that she was sorry....... Take Away......the movie was good, the screen large and the chairs comfortable.. The service was a -3 and the food, at best, a 2. BAD EXPERIENCE !!!!!!! ........You should hope that there is not more than 11 other people in the audience when you go there if you want service and a meal!"}
{"text":"A-OK is right about SMG.  Is it my favorite, no, not really - but as long as they keep offering groupons for $5 movies I'll keep coming back  I also like getting a full meal at my seat.  Though I'm going to ignore the time I got food poisoning.  Really f'd up Best Man Holiday for me.  It was the first showing of the day and my diet pepsi tasted funky - I believe they didn't purge the hoses or something of the soda fountain - but I spent the later part of the movie fighting nausea.  And it was only 11am, and I hadn't eaten anything prior and that night before was also nothing exotic.  Anywho - the reason I can't rave about this place are the servers.  I hate team service.  They are always nice, but the person bringing your food didn't take your order and the pacing is always weird.  When I talk about weird pacing I mean you get your meal and are damn near finished by the time your seat partner (who placed an order with you!) gets his/her meal.  That is weird.  Not to mention they always get it wrong.  They continually mess up thinks like lemon in tea, or utensils..and good luck getting one of the runners to get you anything.  Seriously they drop down a plate of messy nachos sans napkins and silverware..I ask the runner for silverware and he tells me to ring my buzzer for my server.  Not cool studio movie grill.  How about use some common sense and carry napkins and bundled utensils with the runner."}
{"text":"A great place in Charlotte Center City to spend the evening with your wife, catch a movie and with the seat service by very quick staff and good food, it makes for a very relaxing evening. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a night out at the movies."}
{"text":"The menu is limited, the service has improved in the last few months. I like that I can now pick my seats. The menu is okay, but, it is difficult to ask for a variation to a menu item.  When you ask for the sides that you want with an item, they are not included, and you have to push your button and get it ordered. This can be distracting when you are watching a movie.   Most of the staff try very hard, and are attentive, but that is inconsistent. We had one waitress 'instruct' us  that the french fries could not be made to be 'crispy'."}
{"text":"The movie experience was alright..  I ordered a margarita flatbread, it was cold and soggy. I ended up got food poisoning from it later that night. Don't order food from this place"}
{"text":"Low prices, good food with good selection, reasonably priced and served at all seats, reserved seats if you want them, good servers who work at staying out of the way, clean, new and nice but unpretentious. But maybe best of all, they took out about half the seats in every theater and replaced them with large, comfortable seats and \"snack bar\" seats with rolling chairs (also more comfortable than standard theater seats). Not a bad seat in the house. The kids love it, I love it, and my pocketbook is happy."}
{"text":"2.5*  The 1st hour of watching a kiddie movie I sat in those uncomfortable office chairs with my kids thinking it would be easier for them to eat there.   My 4 yr old got fussy b/c he had trouble viewing via booster chair on top of office chair.  So I move to the very top row to the cushion chairs & it was night & day.  Not only was better viewing but my lower back & butt said thank you.  The wait staff tries to work fast to take your order & get your food out before the previews comes on.  It's kind of hard when people come late (after preview) and they have to order.  The most distracting part is when the staffs come to drop off  the bill & collect $$.  People rummaging through their purses (in the dark) looking for their money or cc (including me), all the while the most exciting part of the movie is running.  There's got to be a better way to do this people.  Tips: - come early to place your orders before the previews come on - skipped the office chairs  - kids size drinks are available (not shown on menu) - pass on the soggy nachos - if your drinks don't come, ask & ask again - family fun specials: every weekend @ 11AM, $2 admission"}
{"text":"hello this was my fist time on Saturday  at this place and o boy was it fun you get to eat while you watch a movie together I went to see  sing the movie and we  ate some good  food"}
{"text":"We go to this theatre just about every Friday.   The things we love are: -being able to reserve a seat online so we don't have to get there early -the location is very close to us -the staff is always very friendly -the drinks are great. Love the wine there.  -the food is good. We love the edamame, coconut chicken, sweet potato fries, and salads.  -there's always great groupon deals -food is affordable   The things that are not the best: -it gets a little hot in there sometimes   Overall, it is our absolute favorite theatre!!! Would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My husband and older daughters went to see \"Star Wars\" tonight and had the worst experience. They were one of the first people in the theater and to order dinner. When it was delivered it was cold. My husband sent it back. It took over an hour and three times pressing the buttons to ask about it to get the food again and it was lukewarm. He also ordered a beer that never came. Finally 1 1/2 hours into the movie a server came to say they were out of what he ordered so he just asked for water. When checking out, he was charged twice for each meal ordered AND charged for the beer he never received. We will continue to go because it is the closest to our house and buy Groupons and go on Tuesdays for $5, but we will definitely eat beforehand. What lousy service! And my husband NEVER complains and he came walking in the door tonight livid."}
{"text":"I am visiting from Houston, Texas and I have certain expectations of SMG because my service at home is always superb. Unfortunately, this SMG experience was absolutely terrible. The young lady working my theater clearly hates her job and her service reflects such.  After waiting well over 10 min for initial service it took another 5 to grab my bottled beer and menu. My food came out ridiculously cold after waiting 20 min for it. I spoke with manager who gave me a scripted apology that lacked sincerity. He offered to remake the food...that's it.  My experience totaled $30 and wasn't worth 10% of that. My next visit to Charlotte will not include SMG. Save your time and money."}
{"text":"I had purchased a Groupon here and was excited about trying out the new business since it had been taken over from the MEZ days.  Not a great first impression when it took us almost 15 minutes to get our tickets when we walked in....even though there were just about 8 people in front of us.  They only had one person working the register, and you have to pick out your specific seats when you check in - so I guess that slows the process.  They really should have called for back up.  We were bummed to miss some of the previews and be rushed getting in.  The theater itself is nice and the chairs are very comfortable.  Our server was very nice and attentive.   Most of our food was not very good.  It tasted like bad bar food.  I would skip the chicken tenders next time.  And the fries tasted like something out of a frozen bag at the grocery store - that had freezer burn.  I do have to give them props for my frozen hot chocolate. That was pretty delicious.  I just wish they would have given me a spoon to help me eat it.    Another suggestion would be to have them post some signs in the parking deck by the elevators telling movie theater patrons to bring up their parking ticket to the theater for validation.  We had to go all the way back down to our car to get that to save us the $10.  Sort of a pain."}
{"text":"This is a great place to see a movie, and the food is better than other similar theaters. Great service, comfortable chairs, and nice amenities. The one \"miss\" is that we sat in the back row, which is the same height as the row in front of it, with about 5 feet between the two for the servers to move back & forth- you can't see over the people in front of you.  Big bummer. If you don't sit there, you will love it."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 2 stars because I used to come here all the time using tickets purchased off Groupon ($5-$6 for tickets that are normally $10). I was able to see any movie, anytime... Recently, I found out that they've \"amended\" some of the rules for using tickets purchased off Groupon. The fine print now states that the tickets can ONLY be used Monday-Thursday as long as the movie is showing BEFORE 5PM...anytime after 5PM Mon-Thurs or anytime at all on Friday-Sunday, the tickets are only valued at the face amount you paid for them and you will need to come up with the remainder of the balance to make up the full price of the tickets. So why even have deals on the tickets then? If you're a normal Monday-Friday, 8-5 working individual like most people, the tickets won't even do you any good. Honestly, I feel like if I'm going to go into a movie theater and drop a boat load of money on meals/drinks, etc...I expect to have low ticket prices up front if you're going to charge high amounts for food and drinks. I also took off a star because they always mess up my order. Every. Single. Time."}
{"text":"I've already been to studio movie grill several times, and this is one of my favorite places to go when I want to watch a movie. The concept of eating restaurant-like food paired with a movie theatre is one of the best ideas ever created. You do not have to wait in line for expensive junk theatre food, and have food served to you. I love the option of office chairs or love seats. Although sometimes the waiters take a while to respond to your service light, they are polite and bring what you need. I enjoy eating a meal and watching a movie at the same time. If you do not like eating your food without enough lighting, then this isn't for you, but I do not mind. The 2 for $25 deal is good, and there is also a groupon coupon for $5 for just the movie ticket."}
{"text":"My husband and I live less then 5 minutes away from the theater in Scottsdale, AZ and decided to finally try it out. Both of us were unfamiliar with the theater and all we knew was dinner was served with a movie. We went to the ticket counter and approached the desk. The two girls that were there kept their conversation going until I finally said \"Hi, is this where we go for tickets?\" The girl literally sighed and said \"Yes, have you been here before?\". After explaining to her this was our first time and we wanted to see Frozen at 6:40PM she produced a little screen with seats and told us to pick two. There was a difference in the seats and when we asked how it was set up, she sighed again and went through the speech she much have to go through often, but we were still unclear on the difference between the seats. This was the last thing she said to us. I asked her which was more popular and easy to eat dinner at. This time she didn't reply at all and just stared down at her screen responding to the other girl who was still chatting with her. We picked seats, handed over the credit card (only knowing the price from viewing the total on the register) and got the tickets from her and that was the end of our ticket counter experience. No \"Thanks have a good night\" Or \"Take your tickets to the theater\" or anything else explaining whats next. We walked around for a few seconds and figured to just go to the man standing near the entrance to the screens, he was very friendly and asked if we had been here before. He took our tickets and after that we had a fun time. The food was OK and they had the 2 for $25 combo so it was affordable. But after the experience with the ticker counter, I wouldn't say I would return or recommend this theater."}
{"text":"We use to love to come to this place and enjoyed ordering food and watching a movie. Haven't been in a while, and thought it would be nice to see Star Wars in this setting. Quite disappointed, it's soo dirty! It's like they don't even try. It smells, it's dirty, the lights are falling of the counter tables, it's in need of some  serious TLC and a deep cleaning!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  They have an all you can eat pizza for $10 on Wednesdays!  I would avoid the coconut shrimp."}
{"text":"I visited Studio Movie Grill for the first time with my family over Christmas. My dad had a Groupon, and my parents had good reviews from previous visits. The theatre has a very cool concept - I wish they had these in Calgary as I would go all the time! You can reserve your seats, and pick either recliners or table seats. They have a full menu and bar. Just press the button at your seat, and a server will come take your order.  I've been to similar theatres in Australia, and what I liked about the Aussie theatres compared to Studio Movie Grill was the seats. I didn't like that SMG had some seats with long desks and leather office chairs. I would have preferred to see all reclining chairs - far more comfortable for watching movies! The food and service were pretty good. My mom ordered a piña colada and it tasted like soap, so we sent it back. Other than that, we enjoyed our evening and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is ok for what it is. But if you want a nice movie experience I don't feel that this is the place as everyone is very noisy with their food."}
{"text":"We got to movie an hour early and had to sit in the front, although it was ok and the movie was good, the food lacked. I have the BBQ chicken pizza, which was more sauce than anything else. My friend ordered the BBQ cheddar burger, she couldn't eat it because it was super red in the center and my sister had the nachos which was more like a salad. Will try again..."}
{"text":"Complaints: every time I go here the bathrooms are VERY dirty (my wife says she's scared to use their restrooms). About 30% of the lobby light are out. The floors and lobby tables are usually filthy and riddled with garbage. Even the service buttons at your seats are riddled with grime. I've been to dollar theaters with cleaner theaters. If they'd pay more attention to their facility and less to their advertising and high priced drinks ($12 for a margarita), they'd keep my business."}
{"text":"SMH AT SMG... This movie theater has really gone down. I use to be excited for this movie theater because of the great concept and its in a great location BUT management has not kept up this theater. They have unprofessional teenagers running the place and they seem to be ok with it. The only good thing about this theater is that Groupon always has $5 tickets for SMG which is the cheapest price in town but I much rather go to Starlight and pay more and enjoy the reclining chairs. The food was not great so it defeats the reason to go here."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  Check first with Groupon or Living Social, because very often they have tickets to this theatre for $5.  I still like the theatre overall (much more comfortable seats than a normal theatre, and you can't beat the price!  Just make sure you choose the seats with the \"hearts\" on them, otherwise you're sitting at a counter with the people around you bumping your office chair), but the service has continued to get worse and worse.  The past three times, my food and/or charges have been incorrect.  The latest being last night.  I ordered the chicken fajita quesadillas and a glass of their Sunday wine special ($5 Cab), and my boyfriend ordered the \"endless pizza\".  Our food arrived about 30 minutes into the movie, but the fries that came with the quesadilla were cold.  I let the server know and they brought me a fresh side of fries within 5 minutes (so I was happy), but my boyfriend ordered his next pizza and it didn't arrive until the last 10 minutes of the movie.  When I got the check, they had charged us for two \"endless pizza\" orders, extra fries, and $7 for the wine.  We waited until after the movie to get it corrected (which they did quickly), but I have to say that it is concerning that  the past three times I've been at the theatre they have messed up the order.  If you just want to watch a movie without food, this is an okay place to do it.  But if not, be prepared for your food and bill to be incorrect.  Either way, it's a nice place to see a film, and they always have enough parking, which is why I still gave them two stars."}
{"text":"The looks of the place is pretty cool they have music blaring outside as you walk up. I hate the line set up as if your waiting to check in to a hotel, plane, or waiting for a ride at an amusement park. The staff was totally friendly and attentive until we needed something like another drink or ketchup.   The desk seating w office chairs might be ok if you're a tall person but for a shorty like me or kids this won't work if you want to actually see a movie! Being a parent here to see The Muppets w the kid I noticed this problem immediately. Its not a good view the desk part comes up too high. We had to opt for the theater seats they are big and roomy but you def lose closeness here. Forget watching scary movies and hiding your face in your boyfriends shoulder. Forget a make out session w your secret lover! No cuddling here either! Heck you'll be lucky if you even get to hold hands through all this! If you are more than a party of 2 say goodbye to everyone else because they will be too far away to even see although they're just 2 seats away!   They claim you press the button and someone will be with you immediately and before the movie starts I totally agree. I REALLY like how right before the movie started they prompt you to turn \"OFF\" your phones AND if your child becomes disruptive to step out of the theater! How many movies have you sat through wishing someone would say that???   I was not shocked at the price of food, it is Scottsdale after all. I ordered the Margharita pizza, the man ordered Cesar w grilled Chicken, and the little had a cheeseburger meal. The beer was cheap I thought so why not some Shiner Bock on tap. Our pints came back w no head idk about you but who doesn't like a little head?!?!?!   The food didn't take too long and wasn't so quick either which I didn't mind so much it made me tink they were cooking my food at least. The kid devoured her burger and fries so that got her approval but let's be honest kids will eat anything even McDonald's! Am I right??? My pizza came out piping hot and it was good to go in my belly. I would have liked a little more tomatoes and basil and a little less grease just my opinion. Take it or leave it. The salads are GINORMOUS keep this in mind and ask for extra extra dressing so you don't run out and have to sit there looking at your salad for 15 mins waiting for someone to bring you more! Assuming your options for your salad are either fried or grilled chicken you may think you are getting some kind of HOT meat on it. Well it's not the grilled chicken was cold and while there was a lot of it looked like shredded chicken that's prob not so fresh if you catch my drift.   It is kind of annoying people walking back and forth the whole time and while there is more space between you and other people it still gets distracting. I'll blame my last issue on Mercury being retro, when the check came and they doddled off the pen did not work. I scribbled for 5 mins and gave up. When the movie was over and we got back into light I realized my hands were covered in ink in fact I still have some 2 days later. I wouldn't go here for a good movie that you really need to get into. For family time it's ok I suggest eating at home and ordering some some popcorn, dessert, and drinks!"}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is a great place to take in a movie.  It's a modern dine-in theater with an upbeat atomspere. Great music can be heard in the lobby as you wait for admittance to your movie.  There is also a full bar in the lobby where movie-goers can sit back, relax and have a bite to eat while waiting. Once inside the spacious auditorium you have the option to sit at a long desk-like countertop while sitting in comfy leather office chairs or individual leather seats with foldable table tops.   The food is decent.....kind of like eating at TGI Fridays.  The pricing is reasonable, just like any other restaurant, but its great to space time and eat while watching the movie.  The one thing I found a little difficult is seeing the menu in the dark.  They provide a dim light under the counter.  The light is helpful, but doesn't provide enough   light to comfortably view the menu. Some of the menu items include:  Smoked ribs, Cheddar BBQ Burger, BBQ Chicken Wrap, Thai Salad, Pizza, etc.  An order of Popcorn is so large it feeds at least 3+ people for only $4.95.   If you are so fortuate to come across a Groupon for $5 movie and soda, make sure to get it. You won't regret it.  The drinks along are $2.99.  You can't beat that anywhere.  My favorite is the Strawberry Lemonade."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Studio Movie Grill.  The movie experience inside the theater was fine.  However, the restroom facilities were awful.  I visited 2 different ladies' room and they were both unkept.  They should consider getting complete automatic restrooms."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit to SMG and I am still entirely disappointed in my experience. Yet again my dinner order got lost and I had to ask not once, or twice, but THREE times about it before it finally came out. And I had to ask for silverware - seriously?!?!?  The call button on my seat didn't work and the one on my husband's seat was ripped off the table - screws still there but no button. Thankfully we were guests of a special event because I would be livid if I paid for this experience."}
{"text":"Nice big clean theater that serves food while you watch, at a reasonable price.  There are a few drawbacks, but overall, a fun place to go when you're hungry right at movie time.    We've gotten tons of Groupons to come here, so the price is usually right - it's quite reasonable even at full price, though.  They also have a great drink selection and nice Happy Hour specials.  The theaters are large and nice, but ultimately, I don't find the seating to be quite as comfy as a regular movie theater.    Things to note:  - You choose your seating when buying tickets - at the ticket counter or online at home.  First off, definitely avoid the office chairs with a counter.  Be sure to choose a chair with an attached wooden counter that slides over you or out, like an old-time school desk.  These don't recline and aren't as nice as regular theater seats, but they're still pretty good.  These go fast, though - definitely get there early or buy your tickets online to make sure you get a good seat.  We showed up 35 minutes early for a movie last Saturday and ended up in the second row in the last set of the good seats.  - It stays lighter in the theater than in a non-food-serving place - the servers need to see where they're going and people need to be able to identify their forks, but I find that it's not a prime setting for an Avatar-type visual extravaganza.  - The food is pretty decent, but nothing fancy (try the veggie burger or the Margherita pizza).  They also have dessert (brownie sundae, yay!) and the prices aren't hiked up in the usual movie-food style."}
{"text":"First visit here.  Seems like a nice theater.  Decent sound, reasonably large screen.  The layout is very spacious in terms of leg-room, though the chairs were armrest to armrest.  Still, it was pretty good.  The one thing I noticed was that my butt got sore after a while.  At first the seat seemed very nice, but I was having to shift position frequently after the first hour or so.  I did not have any food, but one in my party did.  It was nothing fancy, but I'm told it was good.  As one would expect, it was over-priced.  But if you can handle $6 for popcorn in most theaters then you probably wouldn't blink at $9 for \"chicken tenders\" and fries.  Staff seemed friendly and courteous.  They also were not obtrusive.  I hardly noticed them at all during the movie even though that's when they deliver any bills for food.  That's good!"}
{"text":"Note to self...double Bloody Mary, definitely worth the $8.  One of the best I've had.  And self...try not to gulp it down all in one voracious, uninterrupted series of swigs next time.  Savor it.  Make it last."}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is the perfect place to kill two (or possibly three) birds with one stone. Dinner, a movie, and even drinks!  My wife and I miraculously had an entire day to ourselves, and we decided to go to the movies. We ended up catching a matinee, which ran us $7.00 per ticket. I had been here before, but my wife had not. She was impressed to find out that you actually have to select your seats (much like buying a plane ticket) before you pay for your tickets.   The theater has two seating options: you can sit at a bar area (one long bar traversing the theater), or you can sit in a big comfy chair with a rotating tray attached to the armrest. The theater alternates these seating options every other row. We opted for the super comfy lounge chairs. They were spacious, soft, and offered plenty of room to spread out and get comfortable...which is a huge plus when you're over six feet tall, and your wife is just shy of it. Suffice it to say, this was the first time I think both of us were genuinely comfortable in movie theater seat.  At each seat, there's a red button you can press to let your waiter know you're ready to place your order, be it food or drinks. They have a full menu for both, it appears. We still had things to do that day, so we opted for sodas (free refills) and a barbecue chicken pizza. The pizza was REALLY good. It came cut into six relatively small slices, which ended up dividing perfectly between the two of us. Not only that, but it came out quite quickly.  As for the theater, we couldn't have been more pleased. The seats are all big enough and spaced far enough apart, you're pretty much in your own little world. The screen is large, and equally visible from every seat in the house. Couple that with an awesome sound system and you're ready to be whisked away into a magical world of make-believe (depending on your taste and choice in movies, of course).  If you or anyone you know is anything like us, picking places for dinner or a movie can be an absolute battle of attrition...let alone picking BOTH. Thanks to Studio Movie Grill, at least the location is something upon which everyone can agree. After that, the choices are up to you!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this but it's necessary. Food service at SMG has gone to hell. They bring the wrong food over & over and by the time they figure out whats yours, it's cold. Over priced, horrible service, all in all just BAD. And whatever u do, DONT give them your CC!!! Order something simple, pay cash & keep your fingers crossed."}
{"text":"Seats are awesome, popcorn was AWEFUL, staff was fair. Our server was nice. However everybody else looked liked they hated being there."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now so I feel comfortable enough giving a review.  I thought I'd be upset about seeing all the workers run around during the movie taking orders and the talking but surprisingly you don't even notice it.  The theater seats are much more spread out than regular theaters so there was never a worker blocking my view and the seats are generally far enough away I couldn't hear anyone talking.  I usually order my tickets online or on Groupon.  They are much cheaper for movie tickets here than AMC or Harkins theaters.  But I'm sure they make up for the money when people purchase food and drinks.  Picking seats is easy to do, I've always been satisfied with the seats I ended up in, my bf and I always got the comfy leather couple seats and we always show up early enough and hang around the bar with other couples.  Their drinks are amazing, they aren't too strong and undrinkable like some bars, they aren't watered down and gross like Apple Bee's or Chili's.  I've had their apple martini's with whip creme vodka, something they turned me onto and it's my new favorite, and I've had their pina colada and long island ice tea's.  All of which I was never disappointed in my drinks and my boyfriend was never disappointed in his.  The food was amazing, I recommend their mushroom bacon pizza or burgers.  But they have a very wide selection of food for anyone's taste.  The place has always been clean when I've been there, front desk, inside, bathrooms, theater room, bar, and hallways have all been clean.  And I've had nothing but positive experiences with their staff.  They've always been friendly and nice with me, I've never received anyone grumpy  or that seemed like they hated their jobs.  I will continue to go here and love the place.  I just wish they'd billed another location closer to m side of town."}
{"text":"Really like this place for two reasons: 1. Close from where I live and 2. The Groupon deal makes it affordable. However,  those seats are the worse and cheap. What was management thinking!!! Free advice to management: Replace those seat for Real recliners.  This is an investment that will help your business and our experience."}
{"text":"The food was the worst.   I went there hungry and left there sick. I ordered a quesadilla  it was hard inside and out and it was cold."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service on manager's part. For the past month or two, we have had to wait in line to be let in to the movie theater, even if the showing starts in 10 minutes. The reason? Because they're still cleaning the theater. This wouldn't be the biggest deal except seating everyone so late means that people are ordering food through the previews and the beginning of the movie itself. When asking staff, we're told that it is because they're understaffed.   Talked to a manager and was told that this was normal for movie theaters and that they were not understaffed and that he knew that all movie theaters only seat audiences within 10 minutes of the movie starting. Really? Most movie theaters seem to allow seating at least half an hour before the movie starts, and those places don't have to factor in people ordering food either.   Also, the LED lights at the seats are located at eye level, meaning your peripheral vision always sees bright lights during the movie, which is pretty annoying. When asking about this, was told it wasn't a problem and was necessary. Really? iPic serves food during the movie just fine without annoying LED lights shining in customers' eyes.   Bottom line? As long as you're prepared to have the first part of your movie being constantly interrupted by your neighbors ordering and receiving food because the theater wouldn't seat you until 10 minutes before the movie started and you're ok with the occasional bright LED in your eye, movie watching here is fine."}
{"text":"The place is consistent. The drinks are good- a tad pricey, but it's a movie theater, everything is expensive. Have not tried the food. However:  Children who are 8 years old or anywhere around there...shut up. Guy who is with GF who did't read the book before seeing the movie....shut up.   I have been there 2-3 times now and will keep going there. I just hope people with voice immodulation disease recognize we can all hear them.   The talkers have only affected us once though, so it's not a regular thing."}
{"text":"Ill start with the good: the place was clean, the sound was pretty decent, and the pizza was far from being the worst I've ever had (we ordered a hamburger pizza). It wasn't spectacular, but it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. Service was fairly quick, too.  Now, the bad: the employees did not seem happy to be there. At all. We ordered a pizza for two, they brought it on just one plate, so I ate off the tray. Prices were above normal for the candy ($5.75 a box), and the selection was horrible (5 items to choose from?! Really?!). The \"waiters\" talked too loud during the movie. How about leaning in and talking to the customer instead of talking over the movie at full boom? Visibility SUCKS! We sat along the back wall, in the chairs with trays, to see Rogue One. The row of chairs in front of us were nearly the same height, so those sitting there completely blocked the view. Its ridiculous!   Now, I know that rude customers aren't the theaters' fault, but they didn't seem to care that a family let their kids run back and forth between their parents and the \"table\" they chose. There was also a bimbo sitting a few seats down from us who used the flashlight on her cell phone so she could see her salad she was eating. How rude! The staff did nothing nor say anything to her while she was shining her iPhone all over the place while eating her salad. Staff should've told her to turn the light off, but they didn't.   Not sure if I'll go back or not."}
{"text":"We used to go to Studio movie Grill for years as our \"go too\" theater but noticed it looking run down. We chose to go there tonight since dinner was literally in the same parking area & I'm so sorry we did. It was a 7:15 movie & a full theater so I understand things were busy but here I go... When walking in the door the floors were filthy & walking down the hallway to our theater it smelt like rancid fruit right by the food pick up area. Once we sat down we ordered popcorn & sodas. The popcorn was SO Salty & TONS of butter, I'm a butter lover but it was gross, soggy & SALTY so we couldn't even eat it. During the movie I went to the restroom which was at the other end from our theater so while walking through the long hall I notice I was the only customer out & about at the time and passed probably 25-30 employees that i saw. They were standing in different places down the hall in groups. Some working on computers & others just visiting with each other laughing & so on. Once I got into the bathroom is was disgusting with water all over the counter, mirror & floor, full trash cans & some stalls without toilet paper. Walking back to my theater on the other end of the hallway, I saw all the same staff members still doing the same. After the movie I walked with my friend to use the restroom & just glanced inside to see if things looked better, NO! It looked Exactly the same. Now here's why I'm writing this review... as I stood waiting in the now busy hallway outside the restroom for my friend I saw an older gentleman in a blue long sleeve shirt that was embroidered with Studio Movie Grill (different shirt than other employees) so I stopped him to ask if the manager was available. He introduced himself as the manager so I introduced myself & explained I'm not a complainer but I felt there are some areas of concern he should know about that we've noticed. I started explaining the popcorn issue & he said \"It could be really hard to tell amounts of butter added\" so I said then place butter on the side. He didn't acknowledge my too much salt comment. Then I proceeded to explain the restroom condition an hour earlier & still looking exactly the same but noticed a lot of employees standing around visiting earlier and he said \"Today is a record breaking movie day & they've been so busy all day so I'm sure the employees were working on the computers checking guests out\". I again explained that a few were on the computer stations but others were standing in the kitchen hall & outside the restroom visiting when areas really needed to be addressed. I walked away from him without receiving an apology for ANY inconvince & felt nothing but excuses were thrown at me. Listen manager, I never even got to explain how dirty I saw the floors & bad the odor was! I have a lot of choices for viewing movies & since you feel that your establishment is flawless and how I Inconvinced you with the reality of improvements needed, I'll happily take my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Oh my, where do I start?  I was doing low carb so I ordered the grilled chicken, which turned out had a sweet sauce all over : ( They took it to our table with no silverware, had to ask for it a couple of times. They mistakenly got me fruit instead of vegetables (again, low carb!) Took long time to get vegetables, no silverware... yet... More than 20 minutes for a drink refill.  : ("}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the food pulled down the rating of what would have been a four or five star rating overall.  The check-in was very efficient since we reserved our seats on line.  The theatre is clean as are the bathrooms.  The service is friendly and timely, so no complaints there.  I usually get the popcorn which is always delicious.  But this time I decided to be adventurous and ordered a margarita flatbread.  It was tasteless, soggy and gluey in texture.  I tested my grandson's cheese pizza.  While my four year old grandson ate it with no complaints; I found it to also be tasteless and doughy.    I did enjoy the glass of Pinot noir; fresh water and speedy service.  The Peanuts movie was great fun to watch.  I do plan to come here again in the future.  But I will stick with the basic movie fare....popcorn!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times always hoping the service will get better but it doesn't. Multiple times we have ordered simple things during the previews such as a milkshake and popcorn, once our order just never came and then the other times it would come out half way through the movie. Tonight we arrived extra early before the previews even, ordered a shake and popcorn. Twenty mins later (while we watch others getting served) we hit the service button again to get an update on our order. Told they would check. Moments later get a shake, no popcorn. We have now watched about the entire theater get served and into the movie. I finally get up and go find the manager to question how we still don't have popcorn. People are nice, but doesn't help when service is always trash. Bad service, not even the comfortable lounge chairs. And they never give napkins!"}
{"text":"My first time and I loved it!  Food was awesome and so was the service.  They could really use some new chairs for the counter seating but no biggie. Next Time we split a meal because there was way too much food."}
{"text":"I love the idea of alcohol and food in the movies, especially when they are brought to your chair. The service is great, the attendants are very nice, and the $25 for 2 special is great. Be sure to get the Groupon deal before you go to save 50% ticket price.  The drink and food are pretty reasonable for an uptown movie theater. The chair is very comfortable. Also, they offer 4 hours of free parking from the time you parked, just make sure your valided your parking ticket.  The only thing is there's very limited movie showing and seating. so if you know the movie is heat especially during weekend go early to buy the tickets if yo don't want to sit in the front row."}
{"text":"I now have been coming to Studio Movie Grill for four years, since it's close to my place in Scottsdale. I have grown to love this theater for its insane affordability and really friendly staff. The seats are not bad at all, and dining during the movie is a fun experience. With inexpensive tickets you can print yourself, a quick service button, and speedy attention, I'd recommend this over a normal theater, sure."}
{"text":"Studio movie grill ha ways been a favorite of mine, as I've gone to them in Texas and Las Vegas when I lived there.  This one has the same concept.  Pick your seat as you order your ticket online, come in and sit down, order your food as you watch and enjoy.  The downside to this location is it seems very worn in, old.  The chairs seem a generation or two old compared to the other SMG I've gone to, and the pivot table feels flimsy comparedly.  Either way, that's the reason for 4 stars,  it's aside from that it's nice.  They have great service and treat you great."}
{"text":"This movie theater really makes me want to scream out in Annie-style \"let's go to the movies\" song. Translation? I like this movie theater! It provides an actual movie going experience. Upon walking inside, I immediately liked the open vibe. It isn't too crowded, it's space and it's organized. A trendy bar sits behind the ticket counter, allowing guests to enjoy a cocktail (or three) before the show.   As pricing goes, this is comparable to your regular movie theater, which is nice! You can grab a regularly priced ticket and enjoy comfortable seating without an increase in price. If you'd like to eat during the show, that's a go too! The pricing for the food is about what you'd pay for concessions at a regular movie theater.   I really like how this theater offers spacious seating with TV dinner style holders and comfortable chairs. My new philosophy is, why go to a regular movie theater when I can go to one like Studio Movie Grill for the same price!?"}
{"text":"The thing that makes this movie theater great is the food, they have a pretty nice variety and it always tastes good. There are two types of chairs, ones like an office chair where there's a desk that you eat at and the other chairs are the classic kind with a pull out table. They give you menus and when you are ready to order you just push a button.  There is assigned seating when you get your ticket which is really nice as opposed to open seating.   The lobby is nice if you need to meet someone there and they have what appears to be a bar to the side."}
{"text":"Coming on and off during the middle of the week is the best way to see a movie with kids"}
{"text":"As usual film and sound quality were outstanding. Food service however was deplorable again. Took 45 minutes to get or four entrees from the time we ordered. Then we had to wait 7 or 8 minutes after film was over to get our check. Reached out to corporate office but complaint fell on deaf ears as usual."}
{"text":"Make sure to clarify with your server to avoid being overcharged!!! Today was my first time visiting Studio Movie Grill for the $5 Tuesday deal and it was a very disappointing experience. Not only did the menu state \"appetizer + drink for $5\" but the server explained that I would get both a drink and appetizer for $5. The server was obviously busy and while I don't believe she intentionally misled us, when we went to pay the bill, my friend and I were charged $8 for two sodas in addition to the $10 for two appetizers. We spoke to two waiters to correct the issue, showing them the menu, but they were rude and unhelpful. It could be the theatre's way of making up the cheap ticket price... Bottom line, make sure you double check with your server and don't let them rush you to place your order."}
{"text":"My star rating is based in the fact that this theatre-meal place is cheaper than all the others in the valley.  The food is pretty good but to have know what to order.  The coconut chicken is delicious!  The pizza is not that great.  Their adult milkshake is yummy!  Reserve your seats before you go as you don't want to get stuck with the office chairs"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here...  I like the option of dinner and a movie all in one  place.   The seating  is comfortable  and they have table  service.   Come early to pick your  seat , especially  if it is a first-class  movie."}
{"text":"This place is gross. Like nasty. The concept is awesome but they have very poorly executed here. Most of the self serve kiosks are broken at the entrance, the Bar area is in total disarray and the bathrooms are cleaned maybe 1x a day.   I'm honestly surprised they can stay in business with much cleaner/friendlier locale like cinebar popping up around town."}
{"text":"My Original review from 12/3/12   We decided to risk seeing the much anticipated Lincoln here as we've been dying to check out Studio Movie Grill. I was a bit worried the whole dining aspect of the place would ruin our experience of watching our movie, much the way screaming kids would.  I did find the servers a dash distracting - totally my fault because as i said  i was initially worried, however,  i was finally able to relax and enjoy rather quickly.  Chairs were not bad comfort wise. Grilled chicken tenders were just okay, though i was happy to see this type of carb free choice on the menu. Erich liked his burger and we both liked having a nice glass of wine. We really had such a nice experience.  This concept works, and i think within a few years this will be the \"standard\" way to see a movie .  And the movie Lincoln was 10 stars !!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here quite a bit but honestly, I just got fed up. The food is ok and maybe that's what saves them from going down the toilet. Pay the few extra dollars and go to Roadhouse Cinemas. It's beautiful, amazing food, great service and the have the best happy hour there.   Here's my issues: I don't know if y'all prefer appetizers before your main meal comes, but I do. So excuse me, Mr. Manager, for ordering appetizers at the same time that I order my meal. (Mind you, I stressed to the server to bring them out before anything else and they always fail).  According to him, I was in the wrong for ordering in that fashion.  Apparently, the correct way, is to place an order of appetizers before ordering anything else, then wait... Then order the rest. So if any yelp readers go here, know not to order like that- it's going to be your fault you don't receive your appetizers before your meal.  Almost 99% of the time, there was something wrong with my order. And I suppose that's my fault too for ordering chicken, out of their selection of Angus, chicken, or black bean burger. They just can't seem to get their act right. With the manager's attitude- I can see why.  Mr. Manager, know that businesses thrive on customer satisfaction. If your system is broke and customers are dissatisfied (I've seem many other frustrated patrons), fix the system, not tell the customer they are wrong."}
{"text":"Front door to back door review for first timer using a Groupon.  I first tried to contact Studio Movie Grill (SMG) to understand their parking validation as well as reserving seats, etc.  Their voice message stated they were having trouble with phone and I left a message for a call back.  Couple of hours later, the manager returned my call to answer my questions.  He gave good instructions on where to park and \"how\" to receive my parking ticket for validation (very good).  Upon arrival at the parking garage and up to SMG on 2nd floor I had my ticket validated. I provided the reservationist all my paperwork (not my credit card) from Groupon and email confirmation with the seating I picked.    Let's say \"Tatiana\" was very \"guarded\" in dealing with me.    First Tatiana told me she needed to see my credit card and I stated otherwise with the paperwork.  She then scanned it without problems.  Tatiana proceeded to tell me there were no seats left, and I told her on the \"PAPERWORK\" is the seat I reserved online using my credit card.  I asked to see the Manager I had spoken to earlier, by then she found it and printed out my tickets. A Manager did come forward and her whole demeanor changed.  Tatiana needs more Customer Service pleasantry skills.  Finding my way up the escalator to another desk just beyond the rest rooms, I was greeted in a more kinder fashion with menus.  Found my seat (very comfy) and then began great service with waiter, then drink runner then meal runner.  All the while these runners going back and forth, the movie was so great, they were ghost. (Olympus Has Fallen).  I shared a delicious Roasted BB Chicken Pizza, crunchy Sweet Potato Fries and  bottomless Sweet Tea.  Not a healthy choice, but the food was very good and hot!  Upon leaving to make it to the women's bathroom, it was backed up with folks waiting.  I walked around and found it a nice and cozy atmosphere where you could wait for your movie to begin and have a meal or drink and not rush already having a reserved seat.  In summary, it was easy to get there and depart and Yes, I recommend SMG as an all in one dinner/date experience even on a Saturday night.  Yes, I am a fan!"}
{"text":"I love this movie theater because they run offers on Groupon.com all the time. Who can beat a $5.00 ticket?!Granted you spend money on food/drinks but people would spend money on dinner anyways so why not just kill two birds with one stone?! All of the servers and workers there are very nice. My only concern is there is not a good number to contact directly to SMG. You get automated robots and answering machines each time. It would be nice to talk to a person to find out if movies are sold out or a question about groupons. The Groupon used to include a soda too- would be nice if that could still be offered. Regardless, I plan on going back to SMG soon!"}
{"text":"This place is great, I love their food, and alcohol drinks. I like that they have reserved sits , I don't have to wait for my seat. Very nice alcohol drinks and lemonades."}
{"text":"thanks to 2 free movie passes, we rode up to Studio Movie Grill today to see an afternoon movie. good thing Twilight was showing because we basically had our movie to ourselves!  the theater we were in was very nice. exceptionally clean. we chose the captain chair seating with the 2 swing away tables. my only negative was that i wish the seats \"rocked\" a little more so i could actively participate  in the movie, as i am a very vocal and dramatic movie go-er (i have no problem yelling out \"oh snap!\" when a greek warrior smashes in the head of his enemy).  we didn't order food, but the prices seem very reasonable and comparable for a mid-range restaurant. even the popcorn and drink prices are about the same.   you have a little call button on your table and a server will come, take your order, your bill, etc. about 45 minutes before the movie ends, you get your bill and then pay and leave it at your seat.   this whole \"dinner and movie\" concept is cool, and i know it's not new, but i'm glad it's catching on. i had a great time, especially since i was with my wife."}
{"text":"First the good stuff: the chairs are insanely comfortable and roomy! I've never noticed issues with outside noise (never gone on a weekend though), bad picture quality or bad speakers. For you guys complaining about the price... Check groupon! They almost ALWAYS have $5 groupons. They also validate parking in the epicenter. Of course the food is a bit over-priced but it's nothing insane. The place always seems clean to me and smells like a vanilla explosion.   The bad: I'm not a picky eater at all...but I've had some pretty awful food here. The ranch is like water and once we got chips and salsa and I sincerely think they gave us straight tomato paste as salsa. We had a group of 3 guys and no one would eat it. I've tried the burgers twice and it tasted like a microwaved bubba burger. Now I stick with the coconut chicken tenders and they're edible. Nothing great and mostly breading but better. I've probably been here 15+ times and the food is usually lukewarm or even cold. Like I said, I'm not picky and understand it's a movie theater... But fried food that comes frozen should at least be warm... Doesn't get easier than that.   Alcohol: I'm not sure they use any? Never had a drink that tasted remotely alcoholic. Wednesday night is big beer night and last time they were sold out of 3 out of 4 options whenever they took our initial order. It was early on a weeknight... Didn't make sense. Then I went to order another and they were sold out of the last option and offered a 12 oz draft bud light as consolation at the same price... The big beers were double the size. Not sure how they thought that was a good deal."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again.  The food was \"eh\" and I noticed almost everything was served in a bowl, so for example my burger was sitting on top of my already mushy fries.  My drink order was wrong and nobody came around again to find out if everything was ok with our food/drink, so that was that.  My sister went another time with her husband and she said they messed up her meal too.  The biggest thing I noticed was that there were literally only teenagers working there, so that probably plays a big role in the lackluster service.  My office chair was filthy when I went to sit down, so I tried to switch it with the one next to it, but it was dirty too.  If it wasn't for the great movie we saw (Lawless!) then I would have really been bummed about the whole experience.  Next time I'd rather just eat somewhere that I know the food/service is good, and go see a traditional movie."}
{"text":"It's a movie theatre that serves food. Great concept, right? We went to see Anchorman 2 on New Year's Day but somehow missed the \"grill\" part and ate beforehand- bummer. The seats have little trays and buttons to call a server to you while the movie is rolling, which is cool- surprisingly, they don't really disturb you when they're serving other people in the theatre. I don't think I even noticed them roaming around while we watched the movie.  Anyway, the problem with Studio Movie Grill is the whole \"seating assignment\" thing. We went to see a movie a couple weekends ago and were sadly disappointed that there weren't two seats together anywhere in the theatre. I noticed this when we went to see Anchorman as well- the seat assignments were almost at capacity but the theatre was not. What is that about? We ended up skipping the movie last time and ate dinner at Vida. Bust.  Next time I'll order tickets online and well in advance."}
{"text":"We went to see Catching Fire Friday night.  The theater was clean, and crowded.  Our server was very nice, but they got my order wrong.  It's hard to take your attention away from the film to get your food fixed.  The chairs are extra large and super comfy.  When we left the theater, the traffic flow was terrible!  People trying to come in, get in line for the restroom, standing with their drinks.  They may want to look at this to create a better experience."}
{"text":"Nice concept, very poorly executed. Only come here if you get the $5 groupon deal, but be warned.  Don't come hungry. 20 minutes from order time to get drinks, they offer refills if you can actually get one. Food took another 35 minutes after drinks arrived. I kept seeing food passing me hoping it was mine so this distracted me from the actual movie. Food wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. Do yourself a favor and eat before you come."}
{"text":"This was just an all around bad experience! I ordered a beer and it took 17 minutes for a supervisor to tell me they didn't have it only to get a hot beer 4 minutes later. The supervisor told me I would not be charged however I still got a bill for $11. I also ordered food which never came. I can see why there is always a grupon for this place."}
{"text":"This theater is cute and I like the open concept of it but I just wasn't very comfortable here Good thing we picked a good, funny movie to watch or else I don't know how else I would be comfortable enough to stay Upon walking in, the SMG looked like a cute modern movie theater The employees are all very nice, young, and clean There is a full bar to your left when you walk in and when we were there, it didn't seem busy or packed which is probably the norm for this location We used a groupon ticket and so the movie was pretty cheap When we walked into the theater I noticed that is was a little dated and really wide I love the whole dining/drinking/movie watching experience but these are some of the things I didn't like about this theater 1) Seating is spaced well but it seems like the people who sit in the chairs in front of you would be in your way 2) Roller ball chairs in a theater would be loud and annoying 3) Although it is a dine-in theater, I hate hearing the sound of rustling paper and silverware clinking 4) The chairs are hard to get comfortable and I was really hoping they would recline 5)The screen volume can get a bit loud sometimes, louder than normal/usual  All in all this isn't a bad theater but it was just one that didn't really do it for me I did enjoy the movie and popcorn enough  Next review could be better if I get the big blue margarita first :)"}
{"text":"The menu says \"Great selection of local craft beers.\"  They have one: OMB Copper. Hardly a selection...the same one beer available in every bar in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The concept is amazing, the food is meh, and the service is terrible. I wish I could say this was my first experience like this. SMG really needs an operational overhaul. We arrived 15 minutes early, placed our order quickly and received most of our order within 20 minutes. Waters and popcorn came out after our meals. One order was wrong twice, and it took me telling 3 different people that my daughter's pizza hadn't come out yet 40 minutes into the movie. I thought restaurants brought out complete  orders. Even the idea of waiting 25 minutes for water is absurd. Please have a team meeting and determine what is or isn't working for this place."}
{"text":"Definitely a different experience. Thought everything was great... Food, customer service, speedy service. The seating was okay but nothing extremely cozy and wasn't super clean before the movie. The movie I saw was absolutely awful but I can't base my rating on that. Id say the biggest discretion was not being able to pay attention to the movie bc of the servers being in the way and the popcorn was ridiculously salty and buttery."}
{"text":"The price is great but same commercial movies than other theaters. The food is horrible and expensive, they need to offer healthier options."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that when you first walk in and you see the small bar area and the ropes to separate us into single groups...I was like are we a herd of cattle or sheep or something. Won't be back here anytime soon...there is more staff walking around in the auditorium than customers.......not to mention the entire place is designed wrong for this kind of movie experience. They  have sections with office chairs... Really office chairs.... I don't even have words for it. There are many other great choices in the valley for this kind of content (food and drink with your movie).....and while we enjoyed the movie....I can't say much else good about the place. The reason it is getting two stars instead of one is because the customer service is top notch.....they are very friendly and attentive. Keep all of this in mind if you should decide to visit here....but continue to Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"I like the idea of Studio Movie Grill better than the actual experience. Good food brought to your seat during first-run movies?  Sure, sign me up. But parts of the operation could, in my personal opinion, be improved.   First, the hallway between the lobby and the screens was dirty and cluttered like a backstage, or behind a bar - there were stacks of boxes, racks of glasses, etc.  I realize a whole set of dedicated service corridors would be prohibitively expensive, but at least make an effort to keep things neat and tidy.  Second, our seats backed up against the riser wall, so they didn't recline. They did rock, as in back and forth.  Some seats faced counters, which reminded me of sports books in Vegas (minus the gambling) - they had office desk chairs. Glad we weren't sitting there.   Third, the always-on reading lights are probably necessary to read a menu during a flick, but they are annoying and prevent the darkness we're used to at traditional movie theaters. By the end of the movie I did get used to it. A little light was probably also a good thing for those folks who were eating. It is easy to miss how important seeing your food is - having to feel around to find your grub and not seeing what goes into your pie-hole can be unnerving. Sight really does inform taste.   At the end of the day I think the Studio Movie Grill isn't better or worse than a traditional cinema experience - I think it is probably just different. At least the price is right - Studio Movie Grill is much cheaper than the theaters we go to back home where we live."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed with this theater. It's gone down since it first opened several years ago. They used to be much cleaner, but I was not happy with the state of our seats. They need a good, thorough cleaning. The tables attached to our seats were not clean, and neither was the button you press to order your food. In fact we had to press the button several times before anyone showed up. I never remember having to do that in the past. I ordered a margarita pizza like I've done in the past. It wasn't nearly as good. My husband's sandwich and fries were good, he said, if not a little bland (the sandwich). I'd have been mad if we didn't have a groupon.  We probably won't return here because far too many theatres have been upgraded and rival this one. The whole food delivery option is nice, and they do manage to do a good job not disrupting the movie and handling the transaction well, but the food is sub-par now. So I'd rather just grab a bite ahead of time and go to a nearby theater in the future."}
{"text":"I had a great time at Studio Movie Grill. I went on a Monday and had the $5 Margarita, which was delicious. Also, I ordered the Coconut Sliders, which I didn't know were fried and the buns were a little bit big for a lady to eat at the movie theater ;) but they were tasty and the fries were good too! It was definitely different than a typical theater because of all the commotion between the 5-7 servers throughout the whole movie, but I think it's just something to get used to. I hope they do more groupons, and I will go again!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and it has always been a good experience for me. I know some of the pictures on yelp show people not being able to see the screen, but I have never had this issue here before.  The service here is good I have never had any problems with that! They are always attentive and quiet to not disrupt the movie. The food has been kind of hit or miss for me. Last time I went I got the roasted vegetable pizza and that was pretty yummy! The pretzel bites were not good though, like rock hard and greasy. Prices are fair, it's a fun time here just have to know what to order!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the North Scottsdale area and finally came to check out this movie theatre. You can order food and drinks (Pepsi sodas, wines, and cocktails) by pushing the red button right by ur seat. There are two types of chairs, and we sat at the office style chairs, and the entire row shared one long table - just like a college classroom.   There was a variety of food options ranging from bento boxes, salads to burgers and chicken tenders. I got the fried chicken tenders with sweet potato fries, and my friend got the chicken quesadilla. Both were good. Very hard to go wrong with these two dishes. I heard the coconut chicken and shrimp was good too.   Overall, I wish the chairs could recline more so you can lie down after eating. However, The staff was very friendly and attentive. Food was fine. Theatre was pretty clean. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"The selection of good movie theaters in Charlotte's urban areas (not the suburbs that are still labeled as Charlotte) are sadly limited. Studio Movie Grill at Epicenter is probably the best of what is available. They have the best selection, offer free parking with simple validation of your parking deck ticket via a machine in the theater, which is typical for most theaters in cities but still very nice.  There are two things that I really like about this theater: 1. When you buy your ticket, you also pick your seat. This is really nice for those of us who tend to stress about getting stuck in traffic and ending up with a neck-craning seat in the front of the theater. 2. You can order food and drinks to your seat before and throughout the movie. The prices are a tiny bit marked up but it's still reasonable. Two bonuses: you can cork your wine bottles and take them home if you don't finish them and they have big healthy salads as a healthy option.  The only thing keeping this theater from getting 5 stars is the fact that I've ended up with one or more broken seats in my group of friends on multiple occasions. It's pretty annoying to be teetering on a broken seat for a few hours in a movie. And, since seats are assigned, usually switching to a different seat is not an option.  Living in Plaza Midwood, this will likely be the place we continue to go to for most of our movie outings."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, drinks were never brought, food was wrong and the Womens  bathroom was extremely dirty.  Movie was over and never received our check.  This place is a joke and needs new management!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, good food, good seating. Just a little pricey.  I will return but 2 of us spent $75."}
{"text":"Fun afternoon on this rainy gloomy Sunday! Note to self - if seeing a blockbuster new release like Mockingjay, reserve seats in advance! Luckily, Interstellar was also playing, so we relaxed for an hour with some drinks and an app while waiting for its start time! (Oh SMG turn the volume down in theater 4! It was unbearably loud and actually vibrated the room! I ended up putting in earplugs that I happened to have in my purse!)  We shared the duo dips/chips. We thought we were just getting spinach dip and salsa, but our order came out with those two plus queso. The queso and spinach dip were very good. The salsa was not flavorful, although it looked liked roasted tomato salsa. My husband thought it tasted like canned tomatoes.  Once we were seated in the theater,  we decided we'd just share an entree. The grilled mahi tacos were excellent, although messy! They need to bring silverware and extra napkins!  The blackened seasoning on the mahi was perfect (and I'm picky with blackened foods) and not too overpowering! It complimented the cabbage-mango slaw wonderfully! The fries weren't a fitting side to tacos, but were excellent as well!  Since it was a Sunday special, I ordered the SMG cab for only $5. Great wine for the money!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but not good. Service is about the same.  I had more fun sitting at the bar than anything else.  This would be a 2 star rating but the bartender earned a whole star just on his own. Great skills and service.  But there are literally hundreds of great bars in town. I don't have to subject myself to the SMG experience to ho to them."}
{"text":"Coming here is like watching a movie in the Big Screen at home without having to leave the couch. I love it. The servers are nice, the seats are comfy, and the food is actually great.  Every day they have deals on drinks or food."}
{"text":"This place kicks ass. There's a posh little lounge area inside the building with a bar and big screen tvs usually with sports on ala Buffalo Wild Wings. You can grab a bite at the bar before you go in to watch your movie, or you can eat and drink inside while the movie is playing, too! They do an amazingly stealth choreography of getting everyones' meals ordered and served, and then they're gone! Great young staff who are on it and seem like they're having fun at the same time. They take your order on Iphones and then print out your bill at the end of the movie. The food is above average and better than I thought it would be. The atmosphere is like having a sleepover and munching while watching a move with 100 of your closest friends! I didn't know if I would like it, but I did!   This place is not your average movie theater at all. The only similarity is they both show movies, but it ends there. This place has a large staff who is bustling around serving a lot of customers a lot of food and drinks when I was there on a Friday night. I respect the coordination, logistics and plain investment it takes to make a place like this happen. in the theater itself, the new Mad Max flick looked amazing even way up close for the sold out show for 8:45 Friday night.  This is the kind of place you want to get there at least an hour early and have a bite and a drink before and/or during your movie, and really enjoy the experience. Don't rush in five minutes beforehand like an ordinary theater because you'll miss the ambiance, the people-watching while everyone is unwinding from their day and the employees who are hustling to give you a great move-going experience. I'll say it's not the most discount way to see a movie, but the food and drink prices are fair for the quality and quantity of what you get and, overall, I thought it was so worth it. Support a neat place like this, people!"}
{"text":"As far as dine in theatres go, Studio Movie Grill would have to be my least favorite in the Phoenix area.  I would strongly recommend going elsewhere to have your dine in movie needs met. The theatre itself was super dirty and not well maintained. There was peeling duct tape along the steps in theatre 6 as well as multiple stains and unattended to spills all over the floor/seats. The service light at my seat was also broken, making it difficult to get the waiters attention during the show. The restrooms were equally as neglected with paper products strewn about, an unpleasant sewage odor, unflushed toilets, and unmentionable puddles on toilet seats/the surrounding area.  In my opinion, Studio Movie Grill could really benefit from a deep cleaning  and some TLC style handy-work to the premises.   Aside from the cleanliness issue, the seating was awkward (I suggest selecting one of the AB seating options, so you don't have to watch an entire movie in a rolling office chair)  and the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"I took my son here for an early movie on Sunday and had a very nice time.  The place definitely has potential and could easily get a better rating with a few adjustments.  First, the theatre itself is beautiful.  The seats are comfy and I like how they have the adjustable little tables for drinks and food.  Service was also very prompt and when my son spilled his soda all over the floor, they were very quick to clean it up without griping or looking annoyed.  Kudos to the staff!  My only issues really were with the food we ordered.  My son ordered the kid's pizza which was quite a large portion; however there was something about the consistency of the cheese that made me wonder if it was 100% real cheese or processed.  The sauce was also quite bland, so I hope they don't use it on the adult pies (but I suspect it's probably the same).  I had the citrus salad which was quite large and good, except for the random sun-dried tomatoes they'd thrown into it.  This was a pretty sweet salad with dried mangos, cranberries, etc. so the savory taste of the sun-dried tomatoes just didn't work.  Also, it came with chicken but instead of sliced grilled chicken, it was either ground chicken or grilled but shaved into little bits.  It didn't taste bad, it was just.... odd.    The menu was surprisingly extensive for a theatre so there's plenty of other dishes I would like to try.  They gave us a couple of two-4-one coupons on the way out so we will be back!"}
{"text":"As our first time at Studio Movie Grill, the appearance was very inviting- clean and modern decor. Upon walking into the actual theater, my boyfriend and I had to switch seats because we reserved the table and office chairs (didn't know this from reserving online), no thanks. After switching to the \"lounge\" chairs, those weren't any better.   The service was pretty slow even though there were only a handful of others and on a quiet Wednesday night. We ordered the chicken sandwich and got it before the popcorn, then after asking, our waiter forgot the popcorn. It was covered in butter and salt, most was even soggy, which made it unbearable to eat. We sent it back and by the end of the movie, we got a new popcorn with the same amount of butter. How can you screw up popcorn twice?! Probably won't return and stick to Harkins from now on."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is good and not overly expensive like other movie/restaurant establishments. But the service is over the top exceptional."}
{"text":"What you can eat and watch a movie like your at home. Servers are informative and helpful. Cost efficient popcorn. Major plus."}
{"text":"Best place to see a movie without waiting in line. The tickets are inexpensive, especially when you purchase them through Groupon. It is helpful to reserve your seats online, at least a day in advance, especially for popular/new movies. If you show up day of to buy tix at the box office, you won't have a good seat selection. The food is good- not amazing. However, this is a theater that serves food also; not a restaurant that plays movies. If you want supreme comfort, reserve the chairs (labeled \"A\" \"B\" and \"V\") and not the counter table seats (labeled \"C\".) The seats have a cupholder and a removable tray for holding your food/drink. Counter seating has much less comfy chairs. I only give SMGrill four stars  because iPic is a much better experience for movie-watching w/ food & drinks, but the cost is considerably more as well."}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE!!! I live uptown & use to go all the time when it was MEZ. Never again will I go back to studio STD. Why pay for some Chuck E Cheese waiter to bother you over & over again and be rude. HELLO?! Trying to watch a movie. I never post reviews, but that was my 4th time there. Consistently BAD"}
{"text":"I don't really do movies much but I had a gift certificate for this place so thought I'd check it out.  Got seats in the furthest back row of the theater, and wouldn't you know it, a couple sat right in front of us at chairs with a long table like a desk.   Since the back row isn't elevated, of course they blocked our view of the screen.   The theater was practically empty so I went down to the lobby to change seats.   Much better.   No one to sit in front of us.  We ordered the \"regular\" popcorn with extra butter and Dr. Pepper.   The popcorn was REALLY salty.  WOW!!  And the extra \"butter\" tasted artificial.  Ughhh!  Is there a lot of salt added so people will buy drinks?   Dunno.  I don't know about you.   I think I'd go to a regular restaurant if I was hungry.   Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"We love it here!  Seating with lap tables best way to go (seats shown as A or B online).  Megaplex burger (I get the turkey, you can also get beef or black bean) is my favorite but also like to ceviche lettuce wraps & bok Choy salad.  Don't miss the popcorn either!  Wines by the bottle are 25% off on Friday & Saturday.  Sweet!"}
{"text":"Meh... That's about how I felt leaving SMG the other night. They were offering a Groupon for a $5 movie ($3 surcharge for 3D glasses). That was enough to get us in the doors. There aren't that many showtimes offered.   The screen was really small and the lighting from the stairs really threw off the movie viewing experience. I appreciate that they do the reserved seating thing but it was difficult to get four seats together without splitting rows. We ended up in the back row.   The service was noticeably slow. The waitress had a habit of just standing in the rows blocking the screen. That got really annoying...   A few notes: The ticket counter is on the 2nd floor. Stop there first before heading up to the theaters. Don't forget your parking ticket, they validate. SMG is definitely not my first choice but I would return in a pinch."}
{"text":"I purchased the Groupon promotion that they were running for $5 a ticket which I thought was great. Upon arrival you choose your seat but they don't tell you that half of the movie theater has office chairs. If you're like me, after getting off of work you definitely don't want to spend another two hours watching a movie in a swiveling office chair. When we walked in, we tried to make the best out of the seats but we just couldn't do it. We went back up to the front to try and pick different seats, but turns out they were full. We tried one more time to sit and enjoy the movie, but it was just not happening. Lucky enough we got the tickets refunded, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Definitely not the movie experience that you would expect. You're better off with a Red Box and some take out food."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and had a great experience. Very friendly staff welcomed us and the place is very clean.    The seats are leather and have a swivel \"table/tray\" attached if you choose to eat lunch or dinner there, which we did.  They have a pretty large menu offering the typical appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, salads and typical movie treats and...WAIT FOR IT....BEER and ALCOHOL!  The nice thing is, you never have to leave your seat, just push the button on your tray, and a very friendly server appears!   I had a burger and beer today (Tuesdays are $2 off burgers and beer).  The burger and fries were tasty and the beer was cold!  I believe they do have other daily specials like $2 off Margaritas on Mondays.    Can't wait to go there again...the movie ticke prices are very affordable and prices for food are comparable to any other restaurant."}
{"text":"I have never ever wrote a review on a place... And this service was so bad, it made me log into my old yelp account just to post this review!! Me and my wife went this past weekend and we waited 2 hours for our food. I tried to be patient but the movie was coming to an end and i sat and watched everyone keep getting their food. They brought our drinks in the first 30 minutes and i never heard from my waiter again.. After sitting i found a manager to only be told that the oven broke and they cant fix my food. So i wont have to pay for it. But i do have to pay for my drinks... They gave me free passes and the service was so bad i dont even wana use them. I gave them away. Ill just stick to the old fashion date, dinner out to eat and then a movie at AMC!!!"}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed all of experiences at SMG. It is not \"luxury\" but you get what you pay for. It is extremely affordable, the service is always great, and the food is good. The seats are not too bad, just comfortable enough. I would recommend you go and try out SMG for yourself, I don't think you would be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love coming for date night here! The service is good and also the food is well priced. We ordered the chimichuri steak salad and I was floored at how amazing it was! The tickets are VERY adorable, I am very happy we live so close to a great restaurant/entrainment venue. Will always be a repetitive clients to this establishment."}
{"text":"Stood in line to use groupon credit from previously expired ticket purchase. Seems easy... First girl didn't know how to do it, second girl attempted to help but didn't know how or what she was talking about, proceeds to roll her eyes at first girl and our questions. Ten minutes of back and forth, manager gets called. He wants to return the tickets we purchased and us rebuy them; by the way he can't guarantee we get them back if some one else purchased them in those couple minutes... Ask if we can use the credit towards food and drink? NO. Can we use credit towards a gift card? NO. So we can't buy the tickets because we may not even have tickets, no food, no gift card, no drink. I had to walk away- absolutely zero accountability and customer service skills. I'm stuck spending $30 on nothing."}
{"text":"Visited this SMG for the first can't say it was a pleasant visit. I had to place order 3 times and it's still never came. At the end they finally brought it. I got my tab for both items that I asked for. The waitress then came back to tell me she had taken one of the items off my tab without me asking her to and said the cash I had placed in the holder to pay the original amount was gone. When my order was brought to me they didn't walk up to my seat they kept walking behind my seat and tapping me to give it to me. Overall this was not a good experience."}
{"text":"I have to say this is the best place to enjoy family movies, a girls night out movie, date night and more.  The price is great and you can order food and drinks directly to your seat!  I have to say this is one of my families favorite places!"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE SMG. My boyfriend & I live nearby and we go to the movies a lot. Few times a month and we haven't been to another movie theatre since we've discovered SMG a few months ago. The food is great, the drinks aren't as strong as most bars or other restaurants but still are good. The chairs are amazing! So big and comfy! If you choose a huge leather chair you can put up the arm rest between you and your partners, creating a couch. The tickets cost just as much as others, so why not choose a movie theatre that serves food & drinks while watching a great movie?!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give them four stars but an extra glass of wine was added to my bill that I didn't notice.  Otherwise it's not as upscale as Ipic but a good option if you live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Swanky place and I've always liked the idea of the movie-grill. Shame is that it usually doesn't execute how you want it to, in one way or another.  The food is, expectedly, a little overpriced for what you get. It's pretty good, but not $12 for a burger and fries kind of good. The theater itself is nice and there's plenty of space and counters and swiveling chair-tables that makes the experience easy.  The caveat currently is that the service is far from smooth. If you order a burger or something of the like that doesn't require a fork and knife, you won't get a roll. Meaning, you won't get a napkin. Meaning, you either ask for one or get up to wash your hands at the bathroom, because getting a napkin here can be pulling teeth! They also didn't know who ordered what (somehow) and had a disorganized array of employees waltzing around trying to deliver the right plate to the right person smack dab in the opening scenes of the film. Sort of distracting.  Overall a fun spot but they need to streamline their system if this experience is going to be 100% pleasant."}
{"text":"This was the worst movie experience I've had. I went to the 12:30pm showing of Transformers in Theatre 4 this past Saturday. There was no warning prior to purchasing tickets that this theatre had no air conditioning. I went with a friend and my 7-year-old brother. We immediately noticed the stifling heat and asked the server if the manager would be turning up the A/C. She said the A/C was broken but that the manager would be coming after the movie to speak with us. At that point the heat was not overwhelming so we decided to stay and speak with the manager afterwards like we were informed he or she would be doing. However, halfway through the movie the heat became overwhelming. I used a small pamphlet to fan my young brother and went outside the theatre on three separate occasions with him so he could cool off. His cheeks were red and I asked if he wanted to leave but he assured me he wanted to stay. Going to the movies is only on special occasions and he had been looking forward to a fancy movie with lunch. We ordered the 2 for $25 deal and to add insult to injury we were served cold nachos and cold pizza. This was the worst waste of $40 I've spent in a long time and I find it appalling that no announcements or warnings were made and nothing was done to make up for the experience. The company just assumed we would all be okay with sitting in this theatre in such heat. We had to figure out what was going on for ourselves in lieu of any announcement of a broken A/C and be placed in an uncomfortable position of deciding mid-movie whether we stay or leave. Quite frankly, I felt dehydrated and uncomfortable for several hours after this movie. After all of this, the manager was not around after the movie. In a 2.5 hour movie, I shouldn't have to fan myself for 1.5 of those hours and count down the minutes until it ends for the final 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Outstanding wings! great location! Must todo! I go every week! It's fun!  They wanted me to write a longer review. It is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a place to go when you're in town alone.  It turns into a club after 9pm.  Very small menu and they only brought half my food order."}
{"text":"Good food, not the greatest service.  I'll probably only go to SMG once ever. I ordered some really good steak quesadillas, stuffed with tons of meat. It was a moderately busy Monday night, but there were only two employees at the bar area. They were swamped with a lot going on, so they didn't do a great job of covering all the customers. Once in the theater, I hit the red service light to get a refill on my Dr. Pepper. Never got anything the rest of the movie.  SMG = great idea, terrible execution."}
{"text":"I ordered two drinks...never received them. Meanwhile the couple next to us ordered 3 drinks, after us and got them within 10 mins. After I hit the service button, asked where our drinks were, I was told they were sorry and our drinks will b up shortly.  They never came. So, I hit the service button again. No one came. After that I hit the surrounding seats service buttons and someone popped right up. Already apologizing for our drinks not coming. I asked to speak to a manager. I was told I can take my receipt..of items that I didn't receive..to the manager afterwards. I asked to speak to the manager now. Then I was told I can walk with them (while the movie I paid for was on) to go see the manager. All while both servers that came were puttin it on the people with black shirts without owning responsibility. While the movies ending. The server comes back and tries to hand me a bill. I'm like why do I have a bill I didn't get anything to drink from you guys. Not even a water. While everyone else in the theater received their items expeditiously. This is my 5th time here after this so called remodel and new management and every time I received poor service. When you guys first opened, I frequented just about every week...especially since I live uptown. Now not so much because of this. Terrible customer service was provided."}
{"text":"A good concept, poorly executed. Server got our order wrong, then brought us the wrong check, THEN dropped our credit card in the walkway and just kept on walking. If you just go to watch a movie, I imagine you'd enjoy your experience. The seats are comfy and sight lines are good. But if I go there again, I won't order anything."}
{"text":"The last time I was here, I enjoyed myself. There was barely anyone there and the service and food was great. Since then, I was apprehensive about going back because the recent reviews make it seem like this place is trashy. Luckily, thankfully, my last trip there was very pleasant and successful.   We used a groupon deal and reserved tickets and seats online. There's an extra fee online to reserve seats, but it still was a good deal. We got there thirty-minutes ahead of showtime and had to wait a little bit with everyone else because the theatre was not yet ready. It was easy to locate our seats.   On my first visit, we had the seats where the table swings in front of you. This time, I selected the \"bar seats\" with office chairs because I wanted more table space. Definitely had more table space, but the chairs weren't as comfortable. Other reviews are right. The other chairs have been downsized.  Our server was fast and attentive. We took advantage of the 2 for $25 deal and ordered: chips and salsa (chips were great, I enjoyed the salsa; my boyfriend didn't care for the salsa), pizza (which I thought was great) and a burger (which my boyfriend said he enjoyed). With an additional soda, the total was just under $30.   The bathrooms were a little weird. Clean, but two of the four sinks were not working. Would go again if we lived closer, but it's just not worth driving an hour for when there are closer alternatives. We went that far because it was one of the two places showing the movie we wanted to see, so if that's the case again, we'll visit again."}
{"text":"I went to see a movie at SMG last night, against my better judgement as I feel every time I go there I have a negative experience. Last night was by far my worst movie experience. My grind and I had movie gift certificate and when he tried to book online we were unable to so we called to have are seats reserved. When we called and explained the situation, the girl we spoke to responded \"I can't do that\" in regards to reserving our seats using our movie passes. She was very unhelpful and make no effort to help us. My friend and I ended up buying tickets online even though we had free tickets. When we got to the theater we each ordered a glass of wine before the movie started. 1 hour into the movie we still did not have our drinks so we turned out light on and eventually someone came over to us and told us the bar is backed up. It had been an hour, and I don't think the bar being backed up is an acceptable excuse. The person then when checking on our orders put in another order for our wine. 1 hour and 15 minutes we got our wine that we ordered before the movie began. When we got our bills at the end we were charged for 2 glasses of wine each when we only had one. It took another 30 minutes to take the 2nd glass of wine off our bills and had to go through 3 very rude and unprofessional people. Our entire bill should have been refunded. We then talked to the manager who talked in circles about how crazy the night had been, again not something the customer needs to hear about. We were not refunded our movie tickets or drinks which should have been a no-brainer. I can't stress enough how rude and unprofessional the servers and management were at SMG. It was like dealing with feet in headlights. This was not a 1 time experience from 1 person. I've heard similar things from others. I will not be going back to SMG and will discourage others from going there as well. Ruined my whole movie experience."}
{"text":"They need to rethink their VIP seating.  They need to boost up the seats so that you can see over people's heads. There are also lights in the row in front of the VIP seats & one man left his on the entire movie.  The brightness was SO annoying & bright...Not even close to a cell phone light.  A great concept with a lousy layout.  Bummer."}
{"text":"I really love this place, had great experiences each time I took my family here however the last time we went, we didnt get our drinks until about 30 minutes after we ordered but the manager took half off the bill and I like the seats and have no complaints."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Just came back from a movie. The movie was supposed to start at 8, but the theater wasn't ready. When it was ready, the previews were already running while everyone entered. No staff could be found for 20+ minutes. Nobody took our order until the movie was 15-20 minutes in. Our food and drinks didn't arrive until more than an hour into the movie, and they forgot my nachos (the waitress told me after the movie that they ran out of chips but decided not to come by during and see if maybe I wanted something g else) and also charged for the nachos. All in all, over a $100 for 4 people to watch a movie and have cold gross food in a poorly run, not even clean theater. No wonder they're not busy even WITH a $5 Groupon. Close already and let something else take your place."}
{"text":"I visited this, location on March 11, 2013 for the advance screening of the movie 42.  I have been to this location on business.  I have noticed some improvements: no more buzzers like Applebees/Chilis, larger portions of fresh hot food and a staff that is eager to assist.  The ticketing system has improved as well.  Everyone was easy to recognize, since they have on the same clothing.   I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Never clean. Overpriced. Would be shut down if not for movie pass and the Groupon for tickets."}
{"text":"Usually have a good experience but multiple times I'll place an order and it never comes !!!! Sometimes that item is still charged to me on my bill as well! I understand mistakes happen, but this is every other time ! Multiple food orders are just lost or something?? Just an inconvenience when your trying to watch a movie ! Should not have to worry about if your order was placed or not."}
{"text":"I have come here a couple times because we had a gift card, it isn't quite as nice as other dine in theaters and its also out of my way so I probably would not return but overall not a bad experience.   The food isn't bad, I ordered a burger that was a bit dry but the server was extremely friendly and overall its a nice place if you are in the area"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, i was a little hesitant over my groupon purchase. I came here 2 years (?) ago when they first opened, and this visit back has been such an improvement! For $5 you cannot beat this experience. Sip on some wine, maybe order a burger....even compared to a normal theater (but a lot cooler) the price is well worth it. There were no bobbling heads in front of me-blocking my view, and I was perfectly comfortable.  We had great service, and unlike some of the other reviews, no questions on our bill...even though they kept trying to give us an extra side of fries...after the second time...i should have just appeased them and taken them. Id recommend the flat bread, fries, salad or duo dip. Everything was pretty good, and with the whole feast plus some drinks we came out under $50.  I may be back, but its a little out of my way, and there are other dine in theaters (a little more expensive but comfier) closer to me. Still we had a great date!"}
{"text":"Yelp I need a negative star option... and I'm not a bad review kinda person but this was hands down one of the worst experiences I've had out in a looooooong time.    This night started out magically why? Because I was on a long over due date night out with my gorgeous guy which only happens once every few months or so due to our work schedules....... and then we got to smg .... so we hadn't been to smg for a long time due to the declining level of service we had continuously been noticing but we saw they had the right movie time for when we wanted to go when other theaters didn't and there was a groupon so we figured we'd give it another try.... a swing and a miss!!!!!!!   So we get there I'm feeling extra prepared phone with Groupon pulled up and ready and parking ticket in hand ready to be validated when we walk up to the desk and the lady asks what movie and what not and i tell her the movie and time and that i have a groupon when she barks that they no longer scan Groupons we have to do it online and I'm like cool no big deal and ask her can i do it from the fandango app she said sure or from smg's website whichever. So i pull up the app go the website from the app get all the way to picking out seats and add my groupon code and then I'm stuck it won't let me go further so i ask for help she barks again to go to the website i say I'm on the website the app took me there she barks again repeatedly 3 times in a row \"GO TO THE WEBSITE GO TO THE WEBSITE GO TO THE WEBSITE\" I'm like in my head YO! I'm Effing there!!!!\"      BUT i decided to do it her way i close out of the website log back into my browser go BACK to the website and she walks me (loudly) through the steps which by the way we're not in any way self explanatory as to how to go through this process of redeeming the Groupons when i said thank you she steps back and under her breath or so she thought maybe she says \"WELL YOU HAVE TO READ\"   Yaaalllllll when i tell you how hard it was for me to not lose every piece of my mind on this girl I truly cannot put into words how mad i was. This girl tested every minute of my 13 years in customer service and the ONLY real thing that kept me from ruining our night and her night was the fact that i was on maybe my first real date night out with my guy in 2018 and i was not gonna let her rude disrespect a** ruin our night. It was a challenge but i overcame it (with multiple margaritas in the theatre)   I will from now on drive my little family ALL the way over to cinebarre or beyond to see a movie and if smg is the only one with a time that works then oh well we aren't seeing that movie that night.  Too bad cause smg is in a great location but at this point that IS ALL.  Don't bother wasting your hard earned money there guys even if you have a Groupon it's still most definitely not worth it!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. My family and I have loved seeing movies in theater so we can experience everything from a giant screen to amazing sound. Even though I've been to the movies hundreds of times, going to see a movie here made me feel like it was a whole new experience. With the addition of servers and easy ordering I felt like royalty and was in a private theater."}
{"text":"We were 6 couples deep ready to see the new Tupac movie. We all decided to meet up at Studio Grill.   We all meet up and was seated in our assigned seats. The chairs were nice but they didn't recline like some of the other movie theater, it wasn't a deal breaker but it would have been nice.   I'm ready to eat....once your seated you push a button and a waiter comes and takes your order.    Okay.... the menu had a lot o good options so I was excited. Most of us ordered the turkey burger with sweet potato fries so that shouldn't be that difficult!  WELL IT WAS!!!!   The turkey burger was not suppose to have cheese...guess what! there's cheese on it.... then the fries were drenched in oil... I can't eat this...  Ringing the button....now I need a new order at this point Im starving and the movie has already started. You can't see in the dark, this is ridiculous! I'm still hungry....  I'm sipping on water with lemon and we try this again. The waiter came back with the right order by this time my husband got cheese and he doesn't eat dairy.....what a nightmare....  Third time is a charm... now we're 45 mins into the movie with no completed food order.  I'm so pissed at this point!   I just had the waiter bring me french fries.... finally with one drink down and four fries eaten I was ready to go.   The waiter had to comp the two turkey burgers which was the least they could do.   This byfar was the worse movie experience ever. I definitely wouldn't go back to studio grill.  The experience should have been a great movie with awesome food but it never happened....   Ipic here I come....."}
{"text":"I tried to like this place, I really did. I gave it three times  and I've officially decided I don't care for it. I do like that there is normally a $5 ticket coupon code,  that is its only saving grace. The food is severely lacking. I have had the steak and cheese sandwich & the coconut shrimp. Which were both alright. We also tried the burger and I actually got sick at the end of the movie, I do have a sensitive stomach so that may have been part of the issue, but I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. The concept is great, but the food is eh, and the seating could be better. You're basically sitting on rolling office chairs. I will say that several months ago the food was a bit better, but it has gone downhill lately. Check it out or don't, you wouldn't really be missing anything."}
{"text":"This is our new go to, and considering we live in Surprise, that says a lot :) The groupons make the drive worth it, we break even and get an awesome movie experience.  The seats are comfy, the theater is less crowded, the popcorn is good (not as good as AMC or Harkins, but good) waiters and waitresses are always wonferful.    I have even hosted a birthday party with 8 kids, using groupons, and have a perfect, hick-up free event."}
{"text":"So I think you're enjoyment level on why you're coming here improves if you're expecting a movie with pub food (basically), and not a fancy restaurant with a movie playing.  If you're expecting the latter then this isn't the ideal place for you.  It's probably best if you split your day up with a nice meal out (Morton's perhaps) then follow it up with a movie.  If you're expecting the earlier, then I believe you're in for much more of an enjoyable experience at Studio Move Grill.  Biggest pro is that you're all in one date night/movie out is assured. It's a one stop shop for food, drinks, snacks, and of course the movie of your choice.  The seats aren't the most comfortable I've ever experienced, but they were still quite nice with a bit of recline to them to really make the sale.  :)  Each had their own little table to eat from with a small drink holder available as well.   My only partial complain about that is my plate was sliding around.  I couldn't figure out why.  :-/  I ordered the sliders (beef), with fruit, and popcorn.  I know, normally I'd go with fries but the popcorn and fries combo would have made me hate myself to much.  This at least made me feel a bit not so bad about myself.  We order about 5 mins before the movie (previews) started, and received our food just before the movie started.  So it worked out that we didn't miss anything.  Although honestly should have ordered a bit sooner so I could SEE the fruit I was stuffing into my mouth.    The sliders were good, not over cooked, with soft buttery buns of goodness showing them some love.  Each bite was actually quite delightful. The fruit that accompanied it was actually very tasty and fresh.  It wasn't like a typical fruit bowl, because it didn't all taste like pineapple (which seems to overpower everything).  Instead (or in this case) the grapes, pineapple, cantaloupe, and melon were all tasty and had their own individual flavors!  :)  The popcorn was... well... popcorn.  I imagine if they would have messed that one up it would have been an instant 1 in the review.  How can you be a cinema and mess up popcorn?  LOL  So that was fine, no issues there!  Movie itself was bright, nice sound, and no noise throughout the movie (more patrons than movie, but whatever).  So it was all in all a VERY enjoyable experience, which I would be happy to repeat provided I'm in the area.  Last follow up (main review is done, if you like it, check this place out!)... I had the sweet tea for my drink.  It's brewed, which isn't typical outside of restaurants, so that was a treat for me and it was quite good.  So... the end!"}
{"text":"The only good thing was the food and service. The seating is very uncomfortable. There are only a few rows with actual theater seats, (which aren't great) and a tray for food. 80% of the \"rows\" are (I kid you not) computer roller chairs with a long table in front of them, very awkward. The chairs are noisy and so uncomfortable. The screen was not as big as usual theaters. During our movie we could hear and feel the loud bass of the movie playing in the theater next to us! The design of this theater is just awful which is unfortunate because it could be great other than that."}
{"text":"Ok so the theater is \"decent\" , just \"decent\" as in there's definitely room for major improvement. I have visited many times and staff has always been cool. Staff is always discreet when taking orders/serving and I barely notice them during a movie. My 1st gripe is the restroom. Recently, I went to the first showing of the day and no soap in dispensers. I try to get some toilet paper and the whole dispenser falls from the wall onto floor. Whoever stocked it had to know it was loose. During  the show I ordered pretzel bites, which came pretty promptly and quickly did I find out why: STALE. The queso had already started to congeal. Another time I visited, I ordered chicken tenders and fries. The tenders were so skinny I thought they were also fries until I shined a little light on them. I love the concept of this place, but sometimes it's the little things that matter... Like handsoap...and fresh food...and secure TP dispensers."}
{"text":"Oh Studio Movie Grille. How I wanted to love you. So let me tell you a story about a magical place called EpiCentre Theaters. It opened in (I think) 2009 and changed everything. It was different from any other theater I'd ever heard of. Sure you could have food inside the movie, drinks even. But you purchased them unobtrusively at the bar and brought them in yourself. No waiters scampering about, no muss, no fuss. And even better - reserved seats! For someone who loves movies and opening nights/weekends, going to the movies can be kind of a nightmare. But not when you can buy your tickets a week in advance and guarantee your assigned seat. Boom. Peace of mind like nothing else. Ten pm opening of The Avengers the night before its official release? Done. Showed up five minutes before the movie to get my beverage and I was all set. No waiting in line for two hours, no battling crowds. And the SEATS. Like sofas in their plush glory. Oh, and no kids allowed in evening shows on weekends. Yep. So then it closed. And I was devastated. DEVASTATED. It was going to reopen under the Studio Movie Grille model. Hmm. I quickly researched what that was and my heart sank. It's one of those chains that tries to copy the Drafthouse and has wait staff inside the theater. Dammit. Ok, but maybe it's not that bad. MAYBE it'll work. Maybe they know something I don't...  So last night was the opening of Captain America: Winter Soldier. I got my advance tickets and reserved my seats ages ago. Woo. This wasn't my first rodeo at SMG as I've been several times and I always hate it. I keep going back for the reserved seats (still a thing) and the location (my hubs and I both work uptown and live 10 mins away). It seems to me that it just doesn't HAVE to be this bad.  We got there last night and grabbed drinks from the bar. The bar service is ok, though they never have one of the wines on the list that is actually one of my faves. Since it opened, they've had this wine exactly once. TAKE IT OFF THE LIST. We hung out in the lobby drinking our drinks, biding our time til we had to go into the theater and deal with the wait staff. It was the first Alive After Five event of the season so the Epicenter was a total nightmare (for low-key people like us) and I wouldn't have gone anywhere near it if it weren't for Cap and reserved seats. We eventually made our way in, got our seats and I decided to run to the bathroom before the movie started. I had to go to the fourth stall in before I could find a use-able stall. This is one of my biggest peeves with the place. The bathrooms are both falling apart/rundown and always dirty. It was nasty.   We ordered some popcorn before the movie started and it actually came out pretty quickly. We've been burned by the service so many times I never know what to expect. My first time there, a drink took 40 minutes to arrive. After the movie started, there was the usual distracting murmur as people continued to order stuff and the waiters continued to use their iPhones to place the orders and ask questions, etc. It's REALLY distracting. (At least at Cinebarre, they have a whiteboard you write on when you need something and only talk if they really don't understand something. Also no iPhones.) Another customer in the theater was using HER iPhone as a flashlight to read the menu. Sigh. It's not just the wait staff I guess.  This continued the whole movie, which is very typical. There are a few basic problems with the model. 1. It wasn't built with this intention. It was built as a normal movie theater. At Cinebarre and Drafthouse, the seating is set up with a step down in front of each row where the servers walk without blocking the screen. This is not the case here. Every waiter, every trip up/down the steps blocks the screen. 2. The servers are all completely inept. It's like it's everyone's first job. They don't understand the basics of either common sense OR service. They will nag you for the check, which they always bring during the important climax of the movie. If there's an issue with the check which you need to discuss after the movie, they'll argue about it also during the movie. Last night the waiter handed my husband the check across my face (which he didn't see because he was watching the movie), blocking the screen during an important scene.   All in all, the only thing I go to this theater for is the convenience of my reserved seat. That's it. If they ever got rid of that, I'd probably never go back. It's the ONE thing nobody else does. There are other theaters that sell/serve alcohol. There are other theaters who serve non-popcorn food. But nobody else lets you reserve an assigned seat. And that is 100% all this theater has going for it."}
{"text":"We have been patrons of this establishment since it's inception; even though we no longer live in the area, we frequently travel here for Date nights. We truly enjoy the service, the  new menu and the movie choices. Our experience last night was not enjoyable for 2 reasons; only one, I'm told, was controllable by the establishment, so, I will start with that one: Our bill arrive after the movie was over. No biggie, but get it together; you guys are usually very good at that! Now, the problem that was \"beyond their control: A, presumably, \"entitled\" woman, with a \"designer dog\", sitting next to me. While I realize the establishment can't ask about the animal's purpose, had it been a true \"service dog\", she would not have felt the need to sneak the animal in, nor quickly hide it back in it's carrier bag when staff approached. I get it, dogs are loveable; I have 2 that are very much family members; however, if I felt the need to eat dinner and watch a movie with my dogs nearby, I would be at home, on my sofa. Cleanliness, allergies or plain old animal phobia makes her decision to, selfishly, sneak her \"Pet\" into an establishment such as this unacceptable to me. There is a reason that the Health Department regulates restaurants. And, yes, I did notify an employee of the establishment; he was a manager."}
{"text":"This place sucks! It could be so great, but they have stupid kids working there who don't care! I have had so many bad experiences here! The food is really good, and it's an easy date night, but sometimes it's not worth the headache."}
{"text":"I bought the Groupon for a movie + soda for $5 last week since I thought it was too good of a deal to pass up.   Loved the bar in the lobby - I was a wee bit early for my movie so it was nice to be able to sit & order a drink prior to going in rather than just standing around.  Inside the theater I was impressed! Comfy chair with a service button and a menu full of tasty treats? It made Magic Mike truly magical.  If that Groupon returns, I'm buying as many as possible."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The staff is so helpful and nice. Get tickets in advance if you can. The food is really good and it comes out quickly. We've been to this theater many times and it is always clean, comfortable, with an enthusiastic staff."}
{"text":"I would like to thank Groupon for the opportunity to try a new dining/movie experience and since we are new to Charlotte, we decided to try a half-off night out to see one of the Oscar raved movies.  First of all, if you purchase your tickets and use promo codes on the SMG website, be sure to note that you need to enter each code individually so you are only charged one $3 processing fee for the two tickets. Also, when you select your seats online, know that the top of the seating chart is actually the front of the theater stadium seating. (We selected seats at the top which were actually at the very front but we were early enough to switch to a higher row.)  There are a few things you may need to know as you decide to purchase your tickets. I am not sure if they had a really recent cleaning of some sorts, but when you walk into the front lobby, there is a tremendous overwhelming scent of vanilla/floral \"car tree\" smelling fragrance that is less than pleasant. I am very sensitive to scents and thought is was one of the front desk employees perfume.  As my husband and I walked up the escalator the scent continued and it even sorta smelled like it was masking possible stale smoke etc..Not completely sure.  Anyways, there is a bar area and you walk to a desk where you show your tickets. We were early so we could decide on the menu and start eating prior to the movie. Supposedly you should be able to be seated 40 mins prior to the movie but we had to wait until 20 mins and we were told someone would come and get us to take us to our seat? Also, it appears there are many employees around but maybe because they just opened at the end of February, but the employees seemed they were still in training.    Also, once we were finally seated, one of our drinks was mixed up and the \"food runner\" didn't know what they were bringing when I asked. I specifically asked if the pizza crust we paid $1 extra for was gluten free and they server said they didn't have gluten free crust when it was on the menu.  Also, we ordered a bowl of ice cream, but a plate with ice cream and a brownie came out with the plate messily covered with caramel. (Even on the bottom of the plate and sides and it got my table very messy.) When we asked what they were delivering the \"food runner\" shrugged and said he didn't know.  (Note: all of this commuication is happening during the movie which is difficult and is why we tried to get in early.)  All in all, the seats were semi-comfortable (not Cinepolis in San Diego :( and the food was decent (pizza burger ice cream etc..) For the price we paid, I guess we got what we paid for. I only hope they find a way to cut back on the air freshener scent and work with their employees on how to respond to customers and know what food they are bringing the guests. Oh, and when we received our bill they actually charged us for the brownie we didn't order and then resolved the bill.  It seems a few loose ends need to be tightened."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this movie location and I come here so frequently i forget to check-in, well today I actually remembered. Really doesn't get any better when it comes to selecting your seats online and having food and drinks combined with a good flick !  If you are a chicken tender lover please remember to try the buffalo chicken tenders with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"What is there not to like about Studio Movie Grill?   You know you are in for a treat right when you walk in and see the bar in the center of lobby,, yes I said bar, I don't see no concession stands here.   You walk into theater and you see right away there are chairs that have side tables, long table with seats and some \"love seats\" for couples to cuddle up on while watching a movie.  I picked the long table with chairs because I like to have room when eating, there was a little red button you push when you are ready to order and within in minutes a nice friendly server shows up and takes care of your order.  I wound up ordered a raspberry mojito, it was the perfect blend of mint & raspberry, tasty lil drink!   For weeks now I have been craving a bbq pizza, one with bbq sauce, chicken, cilantro and red onions, that's it and do you know how many places I have been that said they had bbq chicken pizza that wasn't what I wanted, well I saw on the menu Studio Movie Grill had exactly what I wanted so you best believe I ordered it, and let me tell you, it was delish and satisfied my craving!   I have to say I enjoyed my movie & dinning experience at Studio Movie Grill and look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday party!  It was so much FUN!  The waiting area is open and clean.  There is a bar to get some happy on before the movie.  In the movie theater itself, they have three (maybe four) rows or tables counters with office chairs or the individual seats with sliding tables.  The birthday girl and her friends out the comfy individual seats, so us folks got the table counters with office chairs.  The office chairs were not that comfortable (and reminds me of work).    The movie and sound quality was the same as any other movie place.  The food was yummy!  I got the coconut panko chicken tenders with fries.  You get 6 pieces of chicken not 3 or 4 and plenty of fries.  Service was great.  Those office chair comfort - minor 1 star."}
{"text":"We really like SMG.  We initially went with a Groupon, but have been back without one as well.  The service is great, the food is good (not great) and the seats are comfy.  They have fun events like Classic Movie Night on Thursdays for only $1 and half-priced draft beer.  Plus if you sign up for their newsletter they have deals like 2 new release movies (specific ones) for $10.    The one drawback is the overpriced drinks.  $9 for a shot of Jack Daniels is crazy, so I suggest going on deal nights and/or not consuming alcoholic drinks unless you have the money to burn.  Even a soda is $3.75 which is quite spendy for soda!"}
{"text":"The seats do not recline. The seats, floor, the seat tray were very dirty with crumbs and drink stains.  . The womens bathroom was dirty, paper towels on the floor.  Broken tiles. The lighting and signs to get to the theater room was poor.  Glad we got the tickets through groupon and parking was validated.  Wouldn't come here again.  We came during the day so the place should have been decent."}
{"text":"The Studio Movie Grill is a great place to go on a date night or as a family. The ticket prices are reasonable and quite often they will run a groupon which reduces the cost of the ticket even more.  The food is tasty. On Friday nights, they have a pitcher of margaritas for 25% off and 25% off a bottle of wine. They also have dinner for two specials that include one appetizer, and two entrees featured on the front page of their menu. Any drinks you order are extra and I can say that the ice tea and strawberry lemonade are really good at a cost of $3.50, but they are good sized.  The service is impeccable and the employees are friendly and helpful. The seats are comfortable and the theater is kept clean. I would highly recommend checking this theater out for your next movie."}
{"text":"We had heard some really good things about this place. So I drove from Augusta Georgia to take my sister to the movies.   We went on a Friday night ( opening weekend for Black Panther ) but we saw 50 Shades Freed.   The girl who takes our tickets snapped at me when we tried to go in saying we were way too early ( 25 mins early ) even though the website says to arrive 20 mins before your show. She was very rude in saying it wasn't ready yet.   We got to go in at 1010 and the movie starts at 1015 so then they delayed the start of the previews until 1035.   Then they were out of my first two choices of food and my sisters top two choices for food. They brought me my drink with a HUGE glob of mayo INSIDE the rim of the glass and no way possible to not see it. So I asked for another one. They brought my sisters drink ( same problem ) so we asked for new drinks and waited about 7 mins for drinks ( $4 for a sweet tea )   Our food was brought out cold and it wasn't good at all but I hadn't eaten in 12 hours so I ate it, but my sister didn't eat hers.   The staff was in the doorway during the movie and were talking, laughing, making fun of customer etc and it was really hard to hear or get into the movie.   This is by far the WORST theater I've ever been to. I really wanted to like it but just couldn't. Awful awful awful customer service and not worth the drive or the money. Nope. Just awful."}
{"text":"Love love love Studio Movie Grill! Affordable ticket prices for a great experience. The food is great with a huge selection of food and drink to choose from. My favs are the sriracha sliders, steak and balsamic flatbread and the chicken bites with the Thai chili sauce and honey mustard on the side. We won't go anywhere else even though it's 30 minutes away, that's how much we love this place over other theaters."}
{"text":"At first I didn't like this theater because it wasn't as upscale as the iPic but this all changed after I brought my young son, who is 6, here because I has an awakening that this theater was the PERFECT setting for parents to bring their kids to enjoy movie and dinner at the same time and being able to relax!!!!   The ticket pricing is extremely reasonable, the menu has a great selection of food prepared fresh. I love their kale salad and before I committed myself to working out, I loved their buffalo chicken wings as well. The grilled chicken tender with fresh vegetables is less that 300 calories for the entire order. That's what I'm ordering the next time I come here.  I LOVE, LOVE watching movies- it's also the perfect place to come have lunch and catch a movie whether you're with other girlfriends, significant other or alone. The atmosphere is receptive to all.  The seats are also very comfortable.  Yes, I've changed my mind. Now I LOVE this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  They always have a deal on Groupon.  It is really fun to watch a movie and eat - and the food (especially the fries) are great.  Make sure to get the \"love seat\" seats - they are much better than the rows with office chairs.  They always say to sit in the back, but we think the 2nd or third row of love seats is best."}
{"text":"My wife and I are really big movie fans. We love movies and love going out to eat. So when we find a theater that gives us the opportunity to do both -- we're all in. But this particular venue falls short in both the dining and theater experience.  We've had great watch/dine experiences at iPic theaters and even some AMC theaters. So when we learned Studio Movie Grill offered the same kind of experience, we were excited. Unfortunately, that's not the level of experience here.  Here is what we experienced:  The venue is more of a bar / club. People can come and go to get drinks without needing to purchase a movie ticket. So you have people wandering the building.   If indeed it is a bar, I wonder what the rules are because there are younger looking people (possibly teenagers) in the same bar area with adults.  The venue is almost always dirty. There's no one wiping the floors or picking up trash. The staff seems to take a very long time cleaning the theater between showings. So people are standing in line minutes before the movie begins -- which means they have to order quickly before the film starts.  The food is overpriced for the quality. Though it does come out relatively quick.  Because the venue draws/attracts a bar crowd, you would think there'd be more security...but nah! No one checks anything which isn't safe. There's probably someone in the building but the 2 times I've been here, I've never seen any officer or guard. In fact, I saw a kid come in through a side door and just walk into a theater. If he worked there, you couldn't tell.   The bottom line: this movie/dining experience pales in comparison to others like iPic that you may find in other cities. But I believe that there's no urgency to improve the quality because it's the only place of its kind in the are.   I really hope they get it together. It CAN be better (maybe under new management). But as for now, you're better off eating somewhere else before going to a regular theater."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken wings, chicken fingers and sweet potato fries.  The food arrived barely heated and I sent the fingers back.  They brought out another batch that was just barely warm.  We had a few bites of everything and the flavor was akin to cardboard slathered in bbq sauce.  The screen is small and the constant scooting of the waiters is annoying.  This combo of theater and restaurant fails on both counts.  I will be sticking with my usual restaurants and the Cine Capri from now on....lesson learned."}
{"text":"A dine-in theater with OK seats, meh food, yet friendly servers.   Location: This is in far north Scottsdale. Parking is easy; the lot provides adequate spaces.   Seating: For some reason, I thought the seats would be more comfortable. The options are seats in front of a long bar/desk type thing with office-like seats, and there are other seats that have a roll out small table for each person.   Food: Overpriced and meh.  That said, the pretzel bites were tasty, though the cheese with them was stale and a bit greasy.  The pizza was just OK but tasted bland to me.    Servers: The service was efficient, but we had very few napkins and had to request a box twice.   All in all, I'd attend movies at other theaters."}
{"text":"This is the loudest movie theater I've ever been to. People had to get up and ask for them to turn it down. Projector is so bright it casts shadows. It's just not a good experience. It's a novel idea and within walking distance of my current apt but the convenience isn't worth it anymore. Wait staff is fairly courteous and polite, but I cannot emphasize how poorly this place is run. I try to big optimistic about the epicenter but most businesses here are terrible."}
{"text":"Worst place! Kids were ask to leave the place just because they speak a bit loud. My wife was give a free ticket pass and ask to wait outside. Half way thru the movie then i notice that she was told to stay outside cause my kid talk loud inside. Talk to the manager regarding this, no refund due to their baby policy. All they can do is give me free ticket for the next time. What fxxking baby policy? I don't want and guess what? Manager left. Will never recommend family with kids to this place. Super suck services!"}
{"text":"Overall, mediocre at best. The seats aren't very comfortable even though we had a couples booth. The service is great but I prefer the more comfortable and intimate Esplanade. The food isn't anything special and I'm pretty sure they serve cheap wine."}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times and always love it an have no problems! Bought a Groupon for $5 and Studio Movie Grills website neglects to tell you you aren't allowed to use the Groupons after 5, so had to pay full price tickets and wasted money on a Groupon for nothing. They need to post on their website that you are not allowed to use them after a certain time. Definitely a disappointment!"}
{"text":"The seats are okay but the service is good. Sounds is great and the fact that you can eat and watch a movie without standing up is pretty cool. Prices are okay also didn't spend so much on the food! Sit on the couches when you get to pick seats !"}
{"text":"As I sit and wait in the bar area for my movie to start, I listen to the employees complain about how everyone complains about the food even if it comes out on time..  How the twenty dollar pasta isnt worth it..  How the patrons complain about everything. And now my impression of the service has been tainted and I haven't even ordered anything! How do you as  employees stand in a group and complain about complaints???? And maybe if you were not standing in a group complaining, yet working and servicing the patrons this would not be an issue... Customer Service 101 training is needed ASAP"}
{"text":"Went here last week to see Oz and try out the new restaurant.  The main difference is that you don't have to leave the movie when your food is ready!  That is nice but the trade-off is waitstaff interacting with folks throughout the theatre.    We had the margaritas and quesadillas and everything was great.  I was shocked at how fast the food came out.  The waiters use hand-held things that type the order in so they don't have to go back to a 'station' to type in the order.  All of that saves time and you get your food quickly!  Nothing else has really changed about the place that I noticed.  Possibly the prices are better - Monday they have half price tickets!!!  I didn't get to ask if they still validate parking but i hope so - that is a plus to seeing a movie here.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, to this huge and elegant theater.  Tuesday's are $5 for Seniors; I used a Groupon special that was two tickets for $12 anytime before 5 p.m. showings.  We saw \"The Girl on the Train\" at 1:30 last Friday.  It was so not crowded and a real pleasure.  We did not eat or drink because we already had lunch.  I was visiting from Maryland and I don't think I have been in a nicer theater  Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Honestly not worth the price. The fpod we purchased was worse then a microwaved meal, also the seating is just like an office chair, no matter where you sit. Not worth the ticket price. Also, every single one of the employees were extremely rude and no one seemed happy to be there. Overall, i will never go back there."}
{"text":"Came into Studio Movie Grill for the first time in a long while. In the absence, I heard that their quality in service and food has declined tremendously. I decided to give them another shot and bring my friend along and introduce her to their coconut chicken tenders. They were my absolute favorite on the menu when I used to be a regular.  Until......the \"fast service\". Apparently fast is not always key. The tenders came out far too quickly...and FAR TOO raw. Not just slightly undercooked--but completely transparent and flash fried for for what seemed like less than a minute. This particular mistake is completely unacceptable. I'm the assistant general manager at a restaurant here in Charlotte and I am absolutely appalled. The theatre wasn't busy at all--in fact we were literally the only two people in the theatre.   The server also came back apologizing(I realize it wasn't his fault), but a manager didn't come out to speak with us. Worried to see if in fact they addressed the cook...hopefully no one ordered chicken tenders for their children.   We will be watching the movie and leaving without any made in house food--in hurried fashion."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary. I was expecting something great and fun and was disappointed. We had never been there before and according to the elevator we needed to go to the 3rd floor. after doing so, we had to walk through a small crowd of people that were at a bar right beside the theater. we get inside and were told that we have to go down stairs to get our tickets. The theater was not impressive at all. We did not order anything bis or special, just teas, chips and salsa, and 2 chicken tender meals and it took us approximately 30 minutes to get our drinks and chips and then about 3 minutes later out chicken tenders came out. No one came back to check on us the entire time. Even when the check was brought to us, the empty plates were not taken away until i asked someone walking by if they could take it. When we left, the crowd at the bar beside the theater was huge and we had to push our way through them. Needless to say, neither of us were impressed and I do not think that we will be returning!"}
{"text":"I grew up with a similar-concept theater, Farrelli's Cinema Supper Club, so I was excited when this place came about. Another Farrelli's!  The seating is comfortable, it looks classy and nice. I will say that the menu doesn't give you TOO many options, but what's there is pretty good - definitely leagues better than what you'd get at a regular movie theater, let me tell you that much!  It may not be as upscale or lavish as iPic, but it's still nice - and more cost-effective, which is why my family and I tend to go here more than the expensive yet luxurious iPic. It's a good option if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg, but still want to enjoy a good dinner while watching a movie in a theater."}
{"text":"We loved the atmosphere, but the food is bad. Drinks were watered down. I've had frozen pizza better than theirs. Hamburger was not tasty, and all of it is expensive. Of course, we were prepared for that, but having read the reviews we were just very disappointed. The people are super friendly, and definitely park at the Epicenter garage. We didn't know that they validated parking, and parked at the Marriott garage where the sign said $12, but we were charged $21!"}
{"text":"A co-worker gave me free tickets so one weekend I decided to check it out. I went one Sunday morning by myself to enjoy a quiet movie by myself and loved it! When you first walk in there is a bar and lounge area of you want to hang out before your movie start. When you give your ticket they give you a menu and show you where to go. You get plenty of time to order your food and/or drink(s) before the movie start and if you need something else there is a service button. The drinks are a bit pricey, but well worth it. They have couple seating or regular seating at a little bar. I sat in the couple seating because it is more comfortable than the other. Studio movie grill is perfect if you want to go early in the day and watch a movie by yourself and perfect for a first date/date night. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I purchased the Groupon for Studio Movie Grill and went to see a movie last night. Walking in, the place looked great. The lighting was nice, the woman behind the counter was nice, and overall a good feeling when I walked in. During the movie, my friend and I ordered a drink and some fries to split. I gave the waiter my card to pay for the order and realized that he never returned it to me just as the movie was ending. I immediately went to the front desk to go look for him because I had a bad feeling about this. As I was walking towards the front, he handed me the black folder thing with a receipt, when I get back to my seat, I see HE GAVE ME THE WRONG CARD. I understand people make mistakes, but it's a dark movie theater.  So naturally I assume that whoever card I have, has my card in return. I run down to the the desk as the movie was ending and the manager, tells me not to worry as people are piling out of the movie. I start to panic because I have no idea what they did with my credit card. More people start to come out claiming that they didn't have their card either. It was a complete disaster...The way in which this situation was handled was terrible. Finally after about 15 minutes of frantic, one of the workers finds a bunch of of receipts with cards piled in a lower drawer...I freaked out because I saw my card and the manager grabbed it from me claiming he needed to check to make sure that the \"right amount\" was charged..I grabbed it back and no way, I just wanted my credit card back.   Needless to say, the organization and carelessness was unacceptable. I am beyond disappointed that the staff is not trained enough to have the ability to keep customer's credit cards in order.   Overall, if you must go here, which I highly recommend you do not, pay in cash!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE. This is a tourist trap who cares nothing about their business. If you want a terrible night, go here. I took my wife here to see Star Wars because it's her favorite movie series ever. She was so excited. When we arrive, the floor throughout the entire  building is so sticky I can hear my shoes sticking as I walk- I mean in the lobby, the bar area, the bathrooms, and the theater. The bar tender barely even looks at anyone when people arrive, and when I ask if there is a food menu he literally says, \"it's right in front of you.\" (It was actually across the room). Then, the move is supposed to start at 7pm but at 7pm some kid who works there says \"it's not ready.\" So we wait, and finally get in at 7:15. We order food from another kid who doesn't know how to use the iPad thing that they order on. The food comes about 20 minutes later, and they got my wife's order wrong. I called over (yet another) server and tell her that it's wrong, and she says \"well I don't know what it's supposed to look like.\" Without giving me a chance to just keep the food, she takes it away and doesn't come back for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, I go use the bathroom and it the absolute DIRTIEST bathroom I have ever seen. Only one of the two paper towel dispensers was working, there was only soap in one of the soap dispensers, trash everywhere on the floor, water everywhere. Finally, our food comes and it's COLD. We just eat it. Meanwhile, everyone we encountered was incredibly rude and disinterested. When we left there was literally a line at the checkout of people whose order were wrong. Finally, the movie was turned up so loud I had to put ear plugs in. My wife was very upset, and I was sad for her because it's her favorite movie. Truly the worst movie experience I have ever had. This place gives Uptown Charlotte a bad name. It's a lazy, disorganized establishment that's not worthy of our city."}
{"text":"I will only come here for the $5 Groupon movie deal and nothing more! The service here is H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E! Servers will take down your order but never seem to come back with your food. No one wants to pay for cold food only to receive it near the end of the movie. Came here 4 times and it was never packed to where there were large food orders getting sent in so just make sure you eat before you come. If you decide to order food, MAKE SURE your receipt is correct before leaving. One time my boyfriend paid with his debit card and gave 0 tip. Few days later when he checked his bank account, he noticed tip was added to it. He kept the receipt that had the horizontal line drawn across the tip section yet the server still decided to give themselves tip. What a shame. Make sure this doesn't happen to you! Also, MAKE SURE you get your change back if you decide to pay cash. We went there yesterday and decided to give this place one last try. There were about 7 couples in the theater and we were the 3rd couple to put in our order during the previews. Who knew we'd be the last couple to get our food with only 30 mins left of the movie. They must have forgotten about our food because our food was cold when we got it. This time around, we decided to pay cash. My boyfriend gave $40 to pay for our $31 meal. He expected $9 change back because, clearly, service still sucked but the server decided to keep it. After the movie, we went to the servers' station and had to ask for our change. Why would we tip $9 to someone who forgot about our food??? Apparently we weren't the only ones having problems that night. While we were waiting, there were other people waiting to get their receipts adjusted because random charges were added and wrong orders got charged. Smh. It's unfortunate that the management isn't doing much to resolve the issues."}
{"text":"The lady manager is million times nicer than a guy called mr Mike who doesn't take responsibility for his employees. I called to verify that getting a groupon would work in this location for the movie we were going to see same night. The employee who answered said it was fine and told me to go ahead and buy the groupon. When I called back the studio movie grill to reserve seats and a man named Mike answered,  he changed the whole story and said I can't use a groupon and he doesn't hear me well and nearly changed my mind to ever come to this theatre telling me \"I'm not going to be out of money and to call groupon not him\" So I came in person and asked for the manager since great customer service is my middle name . A lady came over and she was super understanding and saw that she needs to adjust that. She let me keep our Groupon and treated us to a film. That's excellent customer service on her end and I'm rewarding you with 5 stars:)) awesome and I will make up for the movies having excellent dinner and drinks. She is brilliant and should be promoted"}
{"text":"I enjoy the experience and seats are overall comfortable unfortunately I went last night and had a bad experience after the movie ended. At my own choice, I took my 250.00 smart watch off because it kept turning on during the movie with my arm movements. Unfortunately I left it at the theater and I am 99.99%sure one of the staff pocketed it. I was the last out of the theater after watching Avengers and only team members were entering after I left. I tried calling as soon as I reached home and first thing in the morning. There was no way it could have been overlooked, someone took it and failed to turn it in. I'm very disappointed with the integrity of the staff. I guess human kindness can not be expected as much these days. Ps. Don't remove smart watches as a courtesy to others. =("}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The first time that I came to the theatre I could hear the DJ play music outside of the theatre. I complain about it and I was give two tickets to see a movie. I came back to see World War Z and I was told that this was a special movie and I wouldn't use the pass. I only had the option to see one movie and I had already seen that one. The cashier said that they just found out about it. She gave me a student discount, and I still had to pay $21.00 for two tickets.  My girlfriend and I ordered food. What a bad idea!! Her sweet potato fries were soggy and the coconut chicken tenders were greasy and had little batter on them. I order the \"seasoned\" fries and the burger. My burger came out with sweet potato fries and I had to send them back. The burger was a huge and tasted great. The only problem is was greasy that the bun was soggy and that made it difficult to eat the burger. I had to ask twice for my fries and when they came out they were soggy like they were frozen and fried long enough. The movie atmosphere was cool but there are other, better places. I WILL NOT be going back."}
{"text":"From the minute I walk into this theater, I feel taken care of. All of the staff members that I have encountered are extraordinarily friendly and helpful, love the bar area for a pre-movie cocktail, and the cushy seats in the theater are luxurious. Absolutely love that you can order food and drinks from your seat with a push of a button. The response time is quick, and the servers are efficient.  I think the food is pretty darn good, too. And $5 glasses of wine on Sundays - heck yes. We will be back for many more movie outings at SMG!"}
{"text":"I've frequented SMG more times than I can count in the years that I've lived in Charlotte, but my experience on October 26 truly exemplified how poorly ran this SMG is. All started well, until I gave my credit card to the staff who was collecting all checks towards the end of the movie. A male picked up the bill/card holder and 10 minutes later a female employee came back around passing out receipts and giving cards back, but mine was no where to be found. I waited until the movie ended, and went to speak with the manager. The first manager claimed that they had swiped and returned all cards, so I must still have it or it fell under the seats. Annoyed as I was, I emptied my entire purse and even went back to the seat that my friend I were sitting at, to double check even though I knew I gave it to one of her employees. By the time I came back, the general manager came, and I explained the situation. He immediately began to insensate that my friend and I were trying to dine and dash. After hearing his tone, I was completely appalled and frustrated, because I had never been accused of stealing. Furthermore, my friend and I were dressed up, I'm wearing a dress and heels, and it's a Friday night during prime time movie going hours. Do you seriously think I would dine and dash, risking my entire livelihood on a $40 check? Once I realized the angle he was taking it (contextually, I am a Black woman, my friend a Black man, and the GM was a white man), I asked for him to check the cameras and even to call the police because I refused to hand over another card to pay for our food. Find & swipe the card that was given to you!! He decided he wasn't going to do either, and his \"gift\" to me was paying for our night out, which is something I NEVER asked for. I just wanted my card to be found, so that I could pay for my food, and we could have a great evening post the theater. He never asked any of his employees who looked like the description I gave him, if they had been in the theater, to empty their pockets, or if they knew were my card was. However, he did blatantly tell me, that he didn't know for sure if I had ever given a card. SO WHY NOT REVIEW YOUR SECURITY CAMERAS?? Long story short, I left storming out, angry that I had been humiliated and treated less than, and still had to call Bank of America to report my card stolen. NEVER visit this location. Save your time and money!!"}
{"text":"The seating isn't as comfortable as a regular theater and the food prices are elevated; however the food was good. The staff was friendly. The place did seem a bit dirty on the floors, due to all the food traffic etc. You have to watch out for the servers, as they tend to not see you when they carry trays of food, so keep alert. It was different but good. Glad I purchased discount passes to a movie with Groupon, as it saved some money on the family of four adventure here. I prefer the reclined seating at the AMC in Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for this place and I decided to use it the day it was to expire. I read the reviews on here before going and almost changed my mine. But I didn't want my money to go to waste. 3 friends and I went and we had to wait 15 mins before we could even go into the theater because they had to clean up from the last showing. There is a bar with a huge sitting area but the lights were off at the bar and no bartender available. What's the point of having a bar if it's not going to be open? It was 7 PM! We get to the theater to take our seats and the it was filthy. When you buy your ticket you have to pick out your seats. It was as if the workers looked at the seating chart and cleaned just the chairs that were assigned. And I'm not just talking about some popcorn on the floor......literally like half eaten burgers, salads, drinks just SITTING THERE. The seating was ok. I read about the office chairs and definitely didn't want those. The staff was horrible. My friend ordered a California Chicken Sandwich and they put a burger on it instead of chicken. It said \"CHICK SANDWICH\" on the menu,, why is she biting into beef ? The seats next to us had so much left over food on it from the viewing before so we pressed the service buttons on the dirty seats so someone could come clean it. A worker came up to our row and turned off ALL of the service buttons and did not pick up ONE piece of leftover trash. At that point I was ready to go, we had to ASK her to pick it up and she said \"oh ya sorry\". The food was below mediocre. The guac was watery. We even had to ask for silverware. Just overall bad experience. The only good thing was the actual movie."}
{"text":"Since I basically can't go to a movie anymore where alcohol isn't available - we ventured to SMG last weekend. [Yes I have a problem.]  They are/were running a groupon for a 5 buck movie ticket- can't beat that even at a matinee. We were worried they might not honor the groupon after a free movie voucher fiasco we had a while back, so we paid the extra buck fifty and booked our tickets online.  They validate parking in the epicenter garage for 4 hours- but don't pay the attendant when you pull in, make sure you get a ticket so they can validate it!  When you get your tickets you get to pick your seats, so that's a plus - no one begging you after the movie has started to move over so their party of 18 can sit together ugh.  I think their seats are the best around...even though they've let the cup holders get a little murky.   We had a couple beers and split a quesadilla, the food is meh - but I have pretty mediocre hopes for movie theater food.   I think the set up here is pretty distracting, you tell your server your order - instead of writing it down like they do at cinebarre. They also have about a million people coming in and out during the movie - I know the theaters are a lot bigger so they need more people, but it's super distracting!  Our waitress was very friendly - but every other person we interacted with had a major attitude! From the front desk, to bartender, to hostess. Management needs to work on that.  Overall, I will stick to regal ballantyne or cinbarre. I would go again for 5 bucks, but that's probably the only reason I'd pick SMG in the future."}
{"text":"I like going to studio movie grill because they have good deals on movie tickets especially when you're a college student and have a lot going on but I don't think I'd ever go back because their customer service is horrible. I asked for a cup of water when the movie started and I got it on my way out of the movie theater. Staff doesn't care at all."}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill brings a whole other experience to going to the theater.  It's not your typical ruckus of getting there 30 minutes early to get a good seat, drape jackets over the seats while one person stays behind to watch, and wait to order your junk food in the lobby as you stare at your watch waiting for the line to move and the movie to start.  All while you're hoping to hit the bathroom before the movie so you don't have to ask 800 people to get up and let you by.  SMG just crushes all those experiences.  I went on a Tuesday night, which was $5 movie night (YEAH!!!).  Theater wasn't crowded at all and I had a full pick of seats.  You walk up to the counter, choose your movie and a seat map shows up so you can pick where you want to sit.  It's great, so you don't have to feel the pressure of getting to the theater early to save seats.  Once I sat down, I had a menu where I could pretty much choose whatever I wanted for dinner.  I ended up splitting a \"dinner for two\" style menu with a friend.  We had one app to share, two entrees, and a dessert for an extra $5.  I also had a glass of wine that was on special (and was pretty good, too!).  I got a southwestern salad with chicken that was actually delicious.  I was shocked because it was movie theater food, but it's not some nasty salad that was sitting in refrigerated case.  If you do save room for dessert, definitely get the brownie.  Although the movie I saw was terrible, the experience in the theater was great.  I don't know if this place is different during busier times, but they were quick when the theater wasn't crowded!  Great place to go on a date or with friends, and it's a total bonus that they validate parking."}
{"text":"This is probably my new favorite place to see movies and my new favorite way to see movies.  Cocktails and edamame brought to you while watching the newest Thor movie?  Yes, please.   We have been here a few times, and each time has been a winner. They have Groupon offers pretty frequently, which is a great deal.  They also offer different deals for each day of the weeks, such as, $5 martinis on Wednesdays.   You pick out your seat in advance so you can choose from either a cushioned stationery seat with a moveable tray table, or a cushioned desk style chair that has a table top in front of it. We almost always go for the cushioned seats with the swivel table - but both are good options!    Overall: A+ The only way I'll want to see movies now - I'm ruined for regular theaters! Cocktails, blockbusters and snacks, oh my!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise when the phone rang and a friend of mine (M) invited me to accompany her to Studio Grill. Dinner and a movie. Great concept! I had never been before so I was in for a treat.  Our experience was good from the start. M had purchased two groupons for $5 each (or one groupon good for two people- not sure which). The tickets included admission and a soda (iced tea). $5 for a combination of first-run movies with in-theater dining from an extensive American Grill menu and full-service bar?!! Plus the ability to push a button to place your order with an SMG team member directly from your seat and have your food and beverages delivered before and during the show. How could we beat that experience?!?  M and I settled into the comfortable leather seats with attached trays, ordered our food and escaped from the dry desert heat.  We watched Rock of Ages (I loved all the classic rock songs!). My grilled chicken sandwich and raspberry tea were tasty. I was tempted to push the little red button for service during the movie just to push it, but I didn't (TROUBLE is my middle name).  After the movie ended we...yes...we did it. Walked right in to People Like Us. shhhhh Don't tell anyone. Two movies and an iced tea for $5 (plus the cost of the chicken sandwich).  Groupon is offering the deal again today so hurry before the deal expires."}
{"text":"We were in town and needed to kill some time so thought we'd catch a movie.  I didn't know it was a grill/bar as well, it was just the closest theater according to Fandango.  We had a great time, the food was excellent and well-priced (for a theater), and the seats and service were great!  Glad we found that place, hopefully we can catch it again the next time we're in town.  Only downside was I thought the popcorn was actually a WORSE value than the normal theater. (If you can believe that)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to catch movies on an opening weekend.  Reserve ahead for assigned seats - show up - no waiting in line.  Kick back in a reserved chair and enjoy a decent meal at a reasonable price served directly to your seat."}
{"text":"came here on a last minute date night with the hubby so most seats were already reserved. we had to sit in the counter seating which was just computer chairs... not a fan to pay 22 for just the tickets to sit in a not so comfy computer chair. and it was so squished since it was a packed night luckily there was one chair next to me that no one sat in that we moved to get more room. the food was good tho had the sliders and the regular burger with fries. the theater itself was not dark like normal theaters... there is a light on the counter seats that stay on throughout the movie and gets annoying. and the staff was in and out getting others food/drink orders and with the theater not being dark i was very distracted by it...next time we will try to book it sooner to get the table seats in the back that are more leather recliners then just computer chairs."}
{"text":"The concept is cool. But it reality not that delightful.   First instance we ordered before the movie started and had to ask twice more where the order was. By the time the pizza came it was cold and ended up finishing it during the closing credits.... Second instance had to ask for water 3 times for my date and it never came.  Plus everything it's overpriced."}
{"text":"Groupon ran a few specials to this place and I bought a few thinking $5 for a ticket and drink was a great deal...NOPE!  I love the dinner/movie theater concept, so I was excited when Groupon ran their special and was looking forward to trying this place out. I love IPic and the new AMC dinner theaters. But this place does it all WRONG. Horrible execution. HORRIBLE.  First of all, if you don't have \"reserved\" tickets, you need to show up at least an hour or two early to get a decent seat. Shows are always sold out. Theaters are too small and they block out 60% for \"reserved\" seating. Should you find yourself with only the front row available with the rolling office chairs, (this has happened to me twice now), you can't upgrade your tickets to reserved seating at the box office. You have to purchase all new tickets through the kiosk or online for a $2 surcharge (a very annoying, anti-customer service move). A clever backhanded way of getting an extra $2 from the customers. That is bad business. By the way - the Groupon tickets are NOT reserved seating.   When I complained to the manager, he said there was absolutely nothing he could do about the situation (really? Nothing? What good are you as a manager if you have no power to remedy a customer's problem???). Then he proceeded to condescendingly explain the whole \"reserved\" seating thing - yeah, I get it, I'm not an idiot. So I said I probably would not be returning because everything about the place was such a HASSLE. His response: that's fine if you don't come back.  RUDE. BAD FORM.  I can't speak for the food because I didn't even get that far.  Awful place. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Saw The Hobbit tonight. First time at the theater and loved it. Very comfortable, great service. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Staff has no idea what's going on. You have to ask for things 2-3 times. They are rude and no attention to detail. Awful!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Studio Movie Grill several times and have enjoyed each time until this last visit. I was so upset by this last visit that I'm not sure if I will ever visit this theater again. As usual the food was delicious and our waitress was very pleasant and efficient but that's where all the pleasantries ended. When I gave the lady at the ticket desk my tickets, she wouldn't even look at me or greet me. She said, uh huh, grabbed two menus and said you're in theater eight. We then spent the next hour and a half watching something on the screen that should not have been there. I don't know if it was a bug on the lens, or a piece of lint, but something was constantly on the screen which distracted the movie greatly. I told our waitress and she told me that she would get somebody to take care of it. It was removed after a few minutes and within a few minutes after that it came back for another hour. When we left the theater the young man with the mints just stood there, never said a word, even when we told him to have a nice day.  When we left the theater, we went back to the same lady who was not nice in the beginning and told her about the distraction on the screen in the theater. Not once did we get an apology, or I am sorry for your inconvenience. All we got was OK I'll tell a manager. I was not happy at all with this experience. If I'm going to spend $50 on entertainment, I want to be entertained."}
{"text":"SMG is a great concept where you can eat and drink while watching movies, kinda like the Ipic theaters. We used a groupon I bought a few months back. Unfortunately, we showed up a little late, so could not get the \"reserved\" seats that everyone was mentioning on the reviews. We ended up in the general admissions seats which are like executive office chairs. Only thing is they don't recline and don't have much lower back cushioning. But the seats are pretty comfortable nonetheless.   I can see how it can be distracting to have servers going in and out a lot of the times, but I felt like they servers were very courteous and tried to be considerate while talking or moving around.   As for food, we ordered some drinks and the cookies which were good, although quite outrageously expensive. But this is expected as a place like this.   Overall, it was a good experience, but not sure if I would be coming back. It didn't really wow me and I could just do away with good ole regular harkins. I imagine the food here is probably not that great anyways."}
{"text":"Ok.  So let me start this by saying that I love watching movies and as soon as I found out there was a new theater opening up right down the street from me, I was super excited.  Especially since they were to serve food and alcohol!  As soon as Groupon offered a ticket and a soda for 5 bucks, I figured \"How can you go wrong?!\".    Well, we went for the first time tonight (7:30 on a Saturday night) and I must say I was pretty disappointed.  The way the theater entrance is set up is extremely odd and chaotic.  It reminds me of an airport with the people lining up, waiting on benches to get in to their theater and a bar in the corner of the lobby.  Needless to say, it was not a relaxing experience at all.   Luckily we chose a movie that did not come out this weekend or we would have been lined up by groups, similar to the way we now board planes.  They offer \"Reserved Seating\" for a dollar extra per ticket.  I strongly recommend paying the extra buck.  You have to buy it at their ticket kiosk or online only.  Do not go to the box office because they cannot offer you reserved seating.  They seat in this order: Reserved and then general admission for the older movies or Reserved and then in groups of general admission (printed on your ticket, I'm assuming in the order you purchase them).  The difference is huge.  There are two types of seating.  A love seat style, comfy chairs with swivel tabletops that are mostly reserved (these are the only ones you can reserve) and then there are the general admission seats.  These are literally office rolling chairs that sit behind a desk that looks like it belongs in a high school computer lab.  We lucked out and got there 30 minutes early and were able to snag one of the last love seat chairs, thank goodness, or I would have been pretty upset...  As for the waiters, they were very nice and attentive.  I honestly thought that it would have been super distracting with them bringing food in and out during the movie as I am very easily distracted when it comes to theaters.  But I was pleasantly suprised that they were considerate and didn't bother me at all.  After the movie we attempted to try and upgrade our additional groupon general admission tickets for reserved tickets, only to find out that Groupon and movie passes are not able to be upgraded.  The manager was nice enough to exchange our Groupons for movie passes (so they didn't expire for a good while), but we still had to rebuy tickets to reserve tickets.  Like I said, the box office can't do reserved seating, but the ticket kiosks are supposed to be able to.  We tried and failed two times and had to have the manager assist us, even he was unable to purchase them.  However, A+ for the manager as he gave us extra movie passes for our troubles and instructions on how to buy them at home.  Sucks that if you buy them online they charge you an extra dollar per ticket (in addition to the dollar to reserve) just to buy online.  All in all, I'd rather get to Harkin's earlier and go out after the movie to a restaurant than deal with this theater.  Advice for Future Studio Movie Grill Goers:  Buy your tickets online (spend the extra two bucks!)"}
{"text":"The staff is great but the management sucks. I will not be going back. AMC is by far better."}
{"text":"My partner and I were in Phoenix visiting family, but during some of our down time we decided to check this place out. We bought the groupon ahead of time ($5 for any movie ticket) and had the tickets already sent to our phone so we didn't have to wait in line. We also already had out seats picked out so we got the best ones - which was cool. When we were finally seated for our movie, we were given a menu and told that we could order as much as we liked whenever we liked! We decided to order our food as soon as we got to our seats, and it was delivered to us right before the movie itself started. I got the mahi-mahi fish and chips, and my partner ordered the sliders. The food wasn't anything outstanding, especially for the amount of money we paid for it. The seats were also very...interesting, compared to what we expected from the decor in the lobby. The chairs did not recline, and were not very comfortable. Luckily we sat in the chairs that have the trays, because the chairs for the other section just seemed to be rolling office chairs. Which didn't look comfortable. Overall, though, it was a unique experience that I hope continues to improve and expand their menu, and hopefully it will come to Vegas sometime soon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have visited studio movie grill on many occasions. Overall, if you're not ordering food, it's a great place to go to for your movie. If you're ordering food, be prepared to wait an hour. Literally. My boyfriend and I went to smg yesterday for the opening day of avengers infinity war. We ordered before the movie started and ended up getting our food an hour and fifteen minutes later. I understand the business but it was ridiculous. I ordered red wine 3 times. They gave me 1 glass of wine and charged me for 2. A lot of people were complaining at the end of the movie so I assume they were truly very busy which is understandable. I just wish they had a better system. They went to the two rows in front of us when delivering the food delivering to the wrong people. They didn't come to our tow to deliver our food and took the food back to the kitchen. Oh well. It happens. But this was our third visit and our food was delivered an hour later. I wish I could love this place. But I really can't. Eat before you go. Drink before you go. Enjoy the movie and the nice seats."}
{"text":"I am not one to ever leave reviews, but thought it was crazy my order was wrong twice. when I finally got my food 30 minutes after my friends ordered, it was absolutely drowned in salt.... I ordered a salad. After I sent that back I decided to go as simple as I could and went for fries. They were cold and partially frozen. At that point it was just funny. I'll be choosing a different Theatre next time"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 3 and a half, but oh well.  It is a nice clean, dine in theater.  I have been to a few different dine in theaters, so I was not blown away by the concept itself like some people may.  The tickets are a little pricier than some other theaters if you are looking to just see a movie.  I did not eat any food and just got a popcorn and a soda.  This came up to $9.45 before tax which is pretty standard for any theater, but with less popcorn (most theaters will give you at least a refill with a large, but the drink had refills).  The staff puts on a nice friendly facade, but really seem to careless.  For instance I ordered a Diet and got a regular cola and also the carry on quite unprofessionally in the halls if you happen to step out to use the restroom.  The set up is just weird with a row of comfortable chairs with a wrap around tray similar to an airplane to place your food items on, then a row of office chairs with a counter in front of it, every other row.  I don't think I would be too happy if I was stuck in one of the office chairs.  They do have drink specials throughout the week which seems pretty cool, but it is too far of a distance for me to partake."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Great food, great concept, great service 99.9% of the time. They do groupons all the time and it's only $5 for a ticket. I don't like junk food at other movies and they have good options for food. The seats are good, but I don't dig the rolling office chairs. But that's avoidable by getting there a little early.   Chocolate chip cookies are the best!"}
{"text":"used our two free tix coupon tonight to see happy feet 2(horrible movie)  Food was below par - had a burger which was very small and on a real cheap white bun- came ontop of a mountain of soggy fries- food arrived cold- 10$-  Seats were not comfortable- the sound system and picture quality was excellent-  nothing spectacular- I miss Farrelli's Cinema Supper Club which had wonderful food and service and was locally owner- oh well thats the way it goes these days"}
{"text":"We had a place similar to this in Raleigh, NC where I moved from. Except at this one there  are some upgraded things I like better! You can choose where you sit and the menu is a lot more varied. They have a great lobby area to grab a drink. There is a silent buzzer at each seat so you can order with some ease. They do need lighted pens for when it's time to pay your bill. The seating is office like chairs which I could do without but otherwise a nice experience for dinner and movie."}
{"text":"I went with a group of people last night and it was definitely the worst movie theater experience I have ever had. There was blood all over my bathroom stall. My food came out cold and I had to PROVE to the servers that my sliders came with fries. My friends food which she ordered before the movie started came in the MIDDLE of the movie after I told someone that hers still hadn't come yet and when it did come out it was cold and hard. The CIAA menu was very limited, didn't even have popcorn on it, and was insanely overpriced. $15 for 4 chicken tenders and fries!? What the heck? I never got a refill. My friend asked for a box 4 times before getting it after the credits rolled through. I will not be returning nor will I refer friends to attend here."}
{"text":"Love coming to SMG. I am disabled, so being able to reserve a seat makes my life so much easier. The staff is friendly and courteous. On the off chance that they mess up your meal, the managers are always available to help. GM, Thomas Farrell is so accommodating and runs a great place. Not all my friends like this type of theatre, but you have spoiled me for everything else. Here at least once a week."}
{"text":"We had avoided Studio Movie Grill for about awhile as it had become trashy, disorderly and the staff was unprofessional. We decided to take a chance and returned last night to courteous staff, a clean theater and almost a return to its former prestige. Our food was delivered promptly, however...it took three attempts with three different staff members and 3/4 of the movie to get one small merlot which was served in the same sort of tumbler as the watered down Jack Daniels we had also ordered 75 minutes prior to its arrival. Now of course the bill was delivered even faster than our food! Interestingly enough no one seemed to forget to place the overdue drinks on our check just on our table! Tie up some loose ends and train staff on a few odds and ends and we may come back again in a few months."}
{"text":"I'd rank this place as probably my absolute favorite theater in Charlotte.  I know that the service can be very spotty but my review is mostly regarding the theater alone.  Comfy chairs, best in Charlotte.  Wide aisles in and out of the rows and honestly it's never crowded so picking a good spot is never an issue.  I hope it stays that way.  The sound and screen size is superb and exactly how going to a movie should look and feel.  I've never been able to say that going to a movie was relaxing but my latest experience was one of the most relaxing times I've ever had and all the while watching a horror movie.  Interesting.  As we exited the place they even sweetened the deal with a future visit coupon of $5 to come back again."}
{"text":"I have come to SMG many times and the service is always terrible. The only reason I keep coming is because it is the closest theater to my house. Don't try to order food, there will be a problem with your order. One time my friend had to wait until the end of the movie before she record her food, even though we asked 4 different waiters throughout the movie. And they still made her pay full price. Tonight my husband and I had to ask 3 servers before receiving our milkshakes, and then his was completely liquid. It's not worth waiting that long for mediocre food. Servers are often confused and rude.   The women's bathroom (the only one I can speak for). Is always disgusting. Always wet, toilet paper on the floor, and unflushed toilets. Tonight when I went, all 4 sinks were clogged and filled with dirty water and the water had leaked out onto the floor, which was soaking wet. It was impossible to was your hands. Which makes me feel really good about the food that was being made in that place.   I continue to go to SMG solely because it is a convenient theater for me to get to. Don't order food or try to use the bathrooms."}
{"text":"We have been to the Studio Movie Grill before and have had a good experience.  Today it was really bad.  Our waitress was aware that my children and I have to eat gluten free.  I ordered the grilled chicken salad and was assured that it was gluten free.  It was not.  I have been really sick all afternoon.  I doubt we will ever go back.  It is not a big deal if they offer gluten free items, but if you do, please make sure your waitresses are knowledgeable.  I even heard our waitress discussing with the manager concerning another customer.  \"It is an allergy, not a choice\" is what I over heard her mocking, which says to me that she did not take it seriously.  I wish she could have seen me laying on the bathroom floor today."}
{"text":"This place is the worst movie theatre in all of Charlotte!! The service is TERRIBLE ..the people who are employed here are so rude and do not try and help a situation at all! The last incident i had here was with a girl named Meisha and wow I was blown away by the lack of customer service she had. I will personally never return to this place!"}
{"text":"DO NOT go to a movie in theater 5. The screen is broken and the manager knows and doesn't care because he still makes money off food and drinks. Most people won't even tell them that the screen is blurry. All they did was give us \"guest passes\" to another movie (the people who didn't mention the blurry screen didn't get anything). This guest pass cannot be used online so we will not be able to see a movie until it has been out for a few weeks (and is probably moved to the same crappy theater). Another friend of ours went to see Taken 3 over a week ago and had the same crappy screen. They won't fix it because people continue to spend money here.   When I say blurry I mean we couldn't see anyone's facial expressions throughout the movie. Some scenes were so dark you could literally not see anything. I wouldn't be surprised if the other smaller theaters have issues as well."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong this place is very fancy. I like that they play new and old movies.  You go to the cashier and you pay for a your ticket and you also get a huge menu for food and drinks. As you continue to walk into the movie theater you will see a huge bar. No one was sitting there, but if you wanted to get wasted before a movie this is your place to go.   You'll see waiters and waitress walking all around and you find your theater. You walk in and there are rows with huge comfy chairs with a side table that you can put in front of you if you get food or drinks. Don't get me wrong  you definitely get a lot of leg room! However there is one row that is just a row of computer chairs up to a bar table. No one was sitting in front of me, but I can imagine if it was a tall guy/girl I wouldn't have been able to see the screen too well.  With the Groupon that I got it came with a free drink so I got a strawberry lemonade, It'd order it again. Beside the Groupon we ordered a popcorn which was also good. I know they had a lot of other stuff like chicken and pizza and stuff, but I wasn't there to eat dinner.   You have servers walking all around through the movie and you just push this little red button if you want something. But you do have to hear talking through the movie if someone decides to order then.   I also must say it was very cold in there! So if you want to get away from the Arizona heat, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is great. And in a perfect world this would be an ideal place to catch a meal, a movie and even a wine or beer. Before i start the bad stuff, I must say, the frozen hot chocolate there is almost worth the trip in itself. Now, if you buy a Groupon, the new process does not allow you to just give the Groupon when you pay to get in, you MUST do all of it online. Doing this almost made us miss the movie and was so complicated doing on our iphones, we ended up just paying. The seats are comfortable enough and the people who work there are fine but management, well, that is another story. More than once AFTER getting there and skipping dessert at dinner before the movie so we could have it at the theater, we were advised the kitchen was closed. Hmm. No explanation but found on the net that a Studio Movie Grille in Florida had their kitchen closed due to rats. Yikes. The food is definitely hit or miss as stated in another post, and plastic utensils, straws, napkins may or may not arrive with your meal so you have to wait for the server to bring them, therefore, hot food will be cold if it is not already. The place is not very clean and not conducive to whetting your appetite. You can get your parking validated when you pay to get into the movie IF it is done correctly which is not always the case and my friend and I ended up having to pay $20 each because it was not validated properly. In summary, if you happen to hit this place on a good night, it is a good experience but management is well below expectations and I get the impression none of them since the place opened know what they are doing, so you are taking a chance. My friend got sick once after buying our tickets and after being sick in the restroom we went back and asked for a refund -- note it was probably 10 minutes later. We could not get a refund without the manager there and after way too long waiting for the manager to show up, we had to leave without the refund as my friend was desperately ill and vomiting. Doubt we will be going back."}
{"text":"I am mostly a fan of SMG! They almost always have a Groupon, which is a plus for me. I work uptown so it's very convenient to snag a $5 deal and stop in for a movie after work. They usually have a pretty good selection of movies too, almost everything I want to see is playing there.  One of their drawing points though, is also their downfall. I love that they serve food and alcohol in the theater. What is better than eating fries and drinking a beer while you watch a movie? However, some guests seem to think it's a tapas bar and order food and refills constantly throughout the movie, which can be distracting. During one movie, the couple next to me ordered 7 things plus three separate drinks, and then sent one of the drinks back. Even with service during the movie, I still believe that the goal is to be quiet and watch the movie. If you want a full dining experience, go to a restaurant. I can't really blame SMG for this, but I wish there was a cutoff point. All of the food that I had was good, and they carry local craft beers- they're not on the menu though, you have to ask! All in all, this is an upgrade from the traditional popcorn and purse-candy movie experience!"}
{"text":"We went to see Beauty and the Beast on 3/19/2017.  It was a party of four. The layout of the place is nice and located in downtown Charlotte. The thght of being able to eat dinner while watching a movie seems like a great idea. The waitress/waiters are on point with taking your orders, but it's not the same speed with getting your order.   It all seems to come out at different times and never all together. We ordered drinks, but got our food before our drinks. I had a cheese quesadilla with fries, but got chips instead and abt 5 mins later my fries came out. Still no drinks. I later had to press the button for my drinks. After that a random bowl of fries were brought out by the waiter. 20 mins later, the waiter comes out with one random water. The concept of watching a movie a dining is great, but I think they need a better strategic plan for bringing the food out to the people. The food is pretty good other than that."}
{"text":"I decided to try Studio Movie Grill despite the recent terrible reviews, as there was a Groupon for $6/ticket. Sadly, the experience was lacking. I found the staff to be friendly, so this review is not a knock on that aspect.  You can pre-choose your seats online for a $1.50/seat convenience fee. You can look online and see how many seats are already selected. Not many in our case, so we chose to get our seats at the counter. We ended up changing rows because of the poorly designed seats, as mentioned below.  There are 8 rows in the theater, alternating between what are basically office chairs in front of a long narrow table, and comfy chairs with a small slide-back food tray.  I highly recommend choosing the rows with the sliding tray. In the office chairs, you constantly slide around, and are unable to recline your head. Imagine being in your desk chair for 2 hours watching a movie, and that is basically the feel. Bad idea. There was barely room on the sliding tray for the buffalo chicken flatbread we ordered. I'm not sure where any additional food would have fit if we ordered appetizers (food is all brought out at once). The flatbread was ok, nothing special.  When we first arrived and pulled out our chairs, each chair had food left on it from the last movie. The theater had not been cleaned very well, if at all. There were even old candy wrappers in the cup holders.   There was a loud obnoxious couple in front of us ordering drink after drink. Several people attempted to \"shush\" them and told them to be quiet, but they kept arguing for most of the movie. While that is not the fault of Studio Movie Grill, continuing to serve alcohol to people clearly inebriated and unable to stand without wobbling IS their fault, and unacceptable. We spoke to the manager on the way out so he would be aware they should not be driving, and another patron was about to call 911. The manager asked them if they were ok, and then just came back inside. I feel he should have, at a minimum,  offered to call an Uber for them.  The bathrooms were not particularly clean, and overall the place seemed like it had seen better days.   There are other options in the area with a similar movie/food/drinks experience, that seem to execute the concept better. iPic and Roadhouse come to mind."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever.  Went to see Star Trek at 7:15. Ordered drinks and popcorn. Half an hour later, no popcorn. Asked again (pushed the button). Another 20 minutes go by before it shows up, cold. Ordered food and a drink refill. Food came out. No drink. Asked again. 20 minutes. No drink. Asked again. Finally 15 minutes later I went out of the movie and got it myself. No one ever brought one. The service experience distracted enough from the movie that I do not plan to return. This is not the first time we have experienced poor service, but it was the worst."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of going out to the movies, but we all know that some movies are just so much better on the monster screen. I love taking the family to this, the seats are comfortable, its rarely super crowded (but I dont go at \"peak times\") and the food is decent. The food I would put akin to chilli's or red robin and the prices are around the same. The drinks are a touch pricier but not completely out there for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Your experience at this theatre depends on the day and the time you come. Weekends are packed you may not get the seat you desire and long waits on food. Weekdays are easy going. The staff are characters literally the lady who took my order was on the phone asking a co worker to put some cake aside from the mangers birthday party. Huh?! The staff are very comfortable and this could be the destruction of customer service. The place was clean. The food and bar are a plus. The food taste decent, but the bar is nicer. Came all the way downtown to go to the movies because they had a Groupon special. If you're seeing a movie at the epicenter you get free parking. It's a nice spot to go somewhere afterwords or before because it's all in one developmental unit with other stores. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Last night was so rediculous. Notmally,ordering and settling up is a breeze and done before the credits roll. Last night while the credits were rolling they turned down the volume and announced, \"the movie isn't over yet!\"...this is because they had not yet given bills or collected payment from half of the auditorium. So, the credits had completely finished and the house lights were fully on and we were still sitting there waiting on our bill. I had half a mind to leave out and go pay at the bar. In hindsight that's exactly what I should have done. This place sucks more and more (the movies) every time I come! Last night was it for me. Done with SMG! The lounge is always awesome but the movies, completely sucks!"}
{"text":"The seats were very uncomfortable. For a dine in theatre I was expecting more especially from scottsdale. The office seats were a little awkward , the other seats don't lean back and are stiff. Hmm will think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the atmosphere and food at the theater. The menu was varied and delicious. Steak flatbread was the best. Seating very comfortable. Would go again."}
{"text":"Get here early. The place fills up quickly.   I love this place now. The new update makes the place so much more inviting.   The parking is validated for up to 4 hours, which is really awesome. The only reason I gave it for stars was because of the popcorn. You are a movie theatre, your popcorn should be on point. I don't know what it is, but something is not right about it."}
{"text":"I took 6 kids to see a movie here today! It was such an enjoyable outing. Everyone was exceptionally friendly- the manager went out of his way to ensure the kids left happy! I appreciated being treated like real people that are out trying to do something special, instead of just another group of ticket holders.  And the real buttered popcorn is dangerously good!!"}
{"text":"Even the non-office \"nice\" chairs left us with partial paralysis.  Very hard and uncomfortable.  Also, the high school kids working there could use some customer service training."}
{"text":"First time there for us.... here are a few tips for other first timers. 1- try to not sit in the first 3 rows. The screen is too close, color is  thrown off and the insane sound system will kill your ears. Of course....the choice seats will go first so order early.  2- the flatbread pizza was very good as was my metroplex burger. Food wait time was about 20 minutes.  3- allow hours for this movie/dinner excursion.  We live in gilbert.....left home at 5 pm.....got out of a 2hr movie at 8:30  4- the shelf table chairs are set up airline style....you are close to your neighbor and share armrests. It makes for a less than comfortable time and the lounge seats lean back....they do not recline  Overall, it was a good experience. It seriously reminded me of flying coach on an airline. The staff was very nice and helpful through out the evening. Give it a go!"}
{"text":"For one they take movie pass get a 4 just for that alone Next seats are pretty darn comfortable  That's now a five Bonus Servers come to you for cocktails Popcorn  Sushi, salads it's awesome My wife and I had dinner cocktails and watched a movie Under $40  It's a winning combination  Long Islands were great Thanks for the many great times"}
{"text":"I like this better than the previous theatre because now they don't charge extra for \"premium seats\"!  ALL seats are very comfy and plush and they recline/rock.  There is a little tray attached to the chair with a button that you push to place your order for food or drink.  As others have mentioned the attendants can be distracting during the movie.  Other than that, its a cool experience"}
{"text":"I've been here for a movie and a couple parties the atmosphere is nice the drinks are always good too"}
{"text":"Let's be clear: This is not my favorite theater in Charlotte. In fact, it's probably not even in my top three. But for what it is, I've had a handful of decent experiences.  First, understand that you're not going to see arthouse cinema or an up-and-coming foreign film at SMG. They only show the big box office blockbuster flicks.   Before you go, navigate yourself to Groupon and pick up a few tickets for $5 apiece. Depending on the time you go, it may not be a huge savings, though -- we went to the first showing on a Sunday, for example, and only saved around $1.50 a ticket. Better than nothing. And if you don't use your Groupon before it expires, you can still use it as a coupon for the amount you paid.  This is one of those theaters where the servers come to you before and during the movie. For this reason, I would recommend against any type of film where you need to pay close attention for fear of missing details, as there may be a fair amount of distractions if your fellow moviegoers are thirsty that night. Again, shouldn't be an issue, as I've yet to see a subtle, nuanced film playing here, but it's worth noting.  The food is fine. It's more utilitarian than inspired -- think burgers and pizza (both of which come gluten free, if you'd like). It's far from gourmet, but it's good enough and the portions are generous.  I would recommend sticking with early shows, regardless of the day of the week, as the Epicentre can be a real shitshow after dark.    On my last trip, we caught Jumanji at 11am on a Sunday and had burgers and fries. Our server was sweet and helpful, our meals arrived within the movie's first act, and theater distractions were at a minimum. This is how you do SMG."}
{"text":"It's no iPic, but also much more affordable. Yes the office chair rows are a little weird, and the seats don't recline, but the food is really pretty good. We enjoy dinner and a movie here quite often."}
{"text":"We didn't have any complaints. My wife had a sangria and ceviche. The sangria was ok, the ceviche was good. I just had a regular long island ice tea, which was pretty good. Loved the service, the comfortable chairs were very spacious. I really liked the food service at your seat concept. The screen was nice and the sound quality was nice. The menu had a good variety of food and drinks especially considering what a movie theater usually has on its menu. The prices in our opinion were very reasonable. Finished off the afternoon with 2 rounds of pool at only a dollar a game. There were plenty of conversation areas with comfortable seating. There is also a full size bar and an upstairs area. The bathrooms were nice and clean. If you parked in the parking garage remember to get your ticket validated up to 4 hours is free."}
{"text":"I'd suggest to come here if and only if you have a Groupon. They have groupons running constantly. Right now there is a $5 deal for a movie ticket and drink, which is really hard to beat in terms of movie going. However, SMG does not make its money with these Groupons. They are simply a ruse to get you in the door. The fact that they have a bar, serve alcoholic drinks and serve meals throughout the movie is what brings in the big bucks.   I have been here several times, and most recently with my husband. We came in with Groupons, which gave us no trouble, hoping to save some money. We ended up walking out spending upwards of 40 dollars on one appetizer and two alcoholic beverages, plus tip, and the food was mediocre at best. Do not kid yourself. It is not cheap and if you are planning to eat or drink anything besides the soda included with the deal, you will likely not be saving any money at all in the long run. You'll actually probably spend more.  The seats are fine. I think their website overhypes them and makes it look like you're going to be reclining on those bad boys like a king, but the reality is is that half of them are simply rolling office chairs, and the other half are fairly comfortable, but might be awkward if you're sitting next to somebody you don't know. If you're short or have children with you, sit in the office seats. This will assure you that you will be able to see the film without anybody in your way. If you're in one of the big seats, you will likely have somebody sitting in an office seat in front of you, blocking your view.  Sneaking food is a little more awkward here than most theaters, as employees are constantly passing by you. Not sure if they'd say anything to you - probably not. But it still makes me self conscious. But all in all, I'd come back as long as I had a Groupon and a plan."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's extrememly well ran and the staff is friendly, professional, and very helpful. The seating is so comfy, I reccomend the table seats. We went on a Wed and had the endless pizza for $10! The BBQ chicken pizza was as good as I've had at any pizza place. The servers were really fast and pleasant. I was very surprised to find that I was not disturbed by people ordering or the servers, I honestly only noticed them when they came to us. They do a wonderful job of not getting in the way of the movie expirience while still being right there every time you call them. They are better than the service I've gotten in some restaurants. My husband also loved that the volume on the movie was high but not blaring to where it hurt your ears. All in all, a wonderful night. Dinner and a movie for less than it would have cost us to go to a traditional theater and get snacks. Love this place and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have consistently enjoyed my experiences here. I always buy tickets online although there is a 1.50$ service charge per ticket. Not a huge deal, just an FYI. Tickets are $10.50 each which really isn't that bad relatively speaking.  The seats are pretty comfortable although they don't recline. The facility is clean and staff is always friendly. There's a bar in the theatre so if you get there early, have a drink! I've never had a problem with the food. It's not amazing but it's pretty good. All in all a solid place for a fun movie night."}
{"text":"I agree with the person who said good idea, bad execution. The movie was great and the drinks were great (overpriced but great). I understand since this is a sit-down dinner experience that they bring out all the food to you. BUT I really think they should have an area for traditional stuff that people can get themselves. All I wanted was movie theatre popcorn. I ordered said popcorn 10 miniutes before the movie even started. Simple right? It doesn't need to be cooked and should be the first thing people bring out. IT TOOK AN HOUR AND 13 MINUTES FOR THEM TO BRING ME POPCORN!!!! After I waited and saw tray after tray of cooked food brought out I was flabbergasted and confused as to what could be the hold-up. I rang my guy back in case he forgot or they didn't have it entered or something and he rudely said that he was busy and hadn't gotten a chance to get it. When it finally came out half way through the movie cold and without butter, he just plopped it down on the table with no apology or anything to explain. Based off all the other reviews of this place I now realize that I am not the only one. Bad business practices yall. I will make sure to avoid this theatre from now on."}
{"text":"My first experience was last night to see Captain America winter soldier. We saw a 7pm show and the experience was very good. Obviously if you want a regular movie experience with minimal distractions then you need to go to a regular theater. Waiters will be all over the place during the movie. If you are easily distracted it will bother you.   Im not easily distracted and I really enjoyed the movie. The food was good for what I ordered. Coconut shrimp was very tasty snd my wife's order was good as well. Service was what I expected with countless orders being placed. Got my food in 30 mins after ordering. All in all a very good first experience especially for $5 tickets through Groupon"}
{"text":"What's not to love? Comfortable reclining chairs clean atmosphere and beer/cocktails at the push of a button! I would highly suggest ordering beer or wine as the mixed drinks as you would probably guess are very sweet and not strong. I ordered a pitcher of dos Equis with a friend and it came with a plate of lime wedges which was nice. About 18-20 a pitcher . Food was great too ."}
{"text":"I think it was great experience!  Good enough food! It was fun and great service and efficient.  We went on a Wednesday and there was no crowd at all."}
{"text":"Seems reviews are on 2 sides. We got groupon that included ticket and a soda. The regular prices are same as most cinemas. The extra here is what you can drink (alcohol) or eat (bar food). For the ticket price and the rooms, and service this is a good deal.   My friend has been to the really fancy ones and she is glad that here she doesn't have to OVERPAY. For me? I'd do it again when I have another ride to that area. A good idea to go for some movies. True, I wouldn't do it with just any movie.   Food: their menu is very much like a bar menu, so don't expect ultra fancy things or cheap. I had the chicken \"wings\" which turned to be chicken drums (YEEEEEEY!!) and though it says spicy, for me it was mild. One of my friends shared the french fries and they were crunchy outside and soft inside, the way a good french fry should be.   Service was on our side and I can only say they were kind and friendly all the way, same as FAST!. As far as seats, if you can try to pick the ones that have the swing tray/table. Monday was a great day to go."}
{"text":"Stopped in to see Guardians of the Galaxy at Studio Movie Grill in Scottsdale, AZ. They honored 2 Groupon vouchers that actually expired 10-13-2013. Wow! It's a very nice atmosphere and the pricing of the movie tickets and specially the menu are very reasonable. There is a bar while you wait for your movie to begin or take advantage of ordering any drink while inside the theater.  The seating is very comfortable and the ability to call your waiter, at the touch of a button is more than accommodating. I thoroughly enjoyed this theatre and will definitely return. I highly recommend anyone to check it out!"}
{"text":"Much of the food at SMG is finger food, which I appreciated given patrons eat in the dark.  If you're in the mood to share, the Feature Four sampler platter is the way to go-you get two chicken quesadilla wedges, four hunks of Tuscan bread, a few buffalo wings, and chips and salsa.  The Spicy Buffalo Drummettes were surprisingly good, with crisp skin, juicy meat, and medium heat.  It was nice eating the wings in the dark-for once, I didn't have to worry about having sauce all over my face.  The Tuscan Bread was my personal favorite--the garlic butter made the hand-pulled bread a bit greasy, but the gooey cheese and marinara dipping sauce made it impossible to resist.     The chicken quesadillas were standard fare, and I loved the fire-roasted flavor of the homemade salsa.  The sausage pizza was not impressive.  It had a peculiar sweet sauce that conflicted with the flavor of the sausage, and the whole pie was dripping with grease.  Next time I'll opt for the BBQ chicken pizza or the thin crust Sun Dried Tomato & Arugula Pizza, both of which I've heard positive things about.  I tried the Megaplex Burger, and while the meat itself had a nice chargrilled taste, the overall flavor of the burger was boring.  I'd recommend the Steak Sandwich instead - it has shaved beef, mozzarella, sautéed onions, peppers, and mushrooms on top of sourdough bread.  The sandwiches come with fries (very good!), sweet potato fries, or tortilla chips, or you can sub in salad or fruit for an additional charge.  Of all the food I've tried at SMG, my favorites are the desserts.  The Rocky Road Cookies and Ice Cream is a show stopper (no pun intended).  It comes with three warm cookies and a dollop of Ben & Jerry's Nougat ice cream.  In a close second are the Macadamia Cookies and Ice Cream, served warm with a scoop of Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia.  Warm cookies topped with cold ice cream is a hard combination to beat!  I posted a full review on the blog, but these are the highlights."}
{"text":"This is a cool concept but doesn't work well. Good movie theater but the food aspect is slightly annoying. Having servers walking around during movies is distracting but it's nice to have a beer during your movie. If you get the groupon 5 buck ticket it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"This is the most rip off I have every seen in my life. They have got office chairs for movie chairs that are as hard as rock. The drinks are served in dirty glasses with finger marks on them. I got a coffee, it was instant, or at least tasted like it. And the staff are unattended teenagers with no management. Walking around shouting when you can enter the movie room like we are in middle school. Just pathetic. It might be worth it if you get a groupon for $5 but otherwise, DO NOT be mistaken. This is nothing like iPic! See less movies but see them either at Harkins/AMC or if you want to get fancy iPic."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon deal since my boyfriend really wanted to check this place out.  When we got there the place was packed full and we could barely hear the girl at the counter because the music was so loud. It felt more like a club than a movie theater. Once we were finally let inside we sat down and waited for a staff member to come take our order. I watched 2 of them go to every person on our row, yet they somehow managed to skip us. We finally had to press the red button and after waiting several minutes after the movie started someone took our order. Eventually I noticed everyone on our row was getting their drinks.. Except us. Several minutes later we got our appetizer. Still no drinks. Finished our appetizer, then we finally got our drinks and food. My pizza was a little cold, but at least the chicken strips my boyfriend had ordered were warm. We ended up needing refills and didn't get them until right before the movie ended, so that means it took them maybe 40 minutes to get it. I'm not too happy with the experience, but I'm glad I didn't spend full price on the tickets. I don't think we'll go there again."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the upscale theater w/dining and leather, huge seats!   Gotta say that the sloped floors make for every seat being a \"good seat\" in the house; even in the back row - excellent view (and I'm short!).   I didn't study the menu too much, and ordered a water and Diet Coke. My date (who ended up being a jerk, but that's besides the point) ordered Chicken Nachos. Very tasty but pretty \"wet\" w/gobs of sour cream, etc. Normally, I wouldn't be so concerned but have you tried digging for a solid chip under goop in the dark, and on a date? Was tasty once I found chips. :)  Prices of tix? Don't know - my jerky date paid in advance for tickets. :)  American Sniper, btw - was excellent. Very deep, but great flick. If you're squeemish, probably want to avoid.  Clean stadium as well as bathrooms - great job!  Friendly service too."}
{"text":"My favorite movie theater has turned into a place to avoid. Movies and popcorn go together like peanut butter and jelly. Am I right?  So popcorn should be a core competency of any movie theater. After three attempts we received over salted and cold popcorn. The servers offered to replace it a forth time, really they did. As a foodie and a Yelp elite I call it as I experience it. Yes they took it off the bill, but that's not the point. Third time with bad popcorn is a trend not an anomaly. Sorry folks we are gone forever!"}
{"text":"Great concept but bad execution!!! I went there and the place is clean and the seats are comfortable and the food was pretty good.  However, I ordered a drink and large popcorn at the bar before the show for about $20 and was told that there was unlimited refills for the popcorn.  When I asked for a refill of the popcorn while in the movie the \"waitress\" was totally confused. She told me that only applies when you are in the movie and I told her that doesn't make sense since I bought it 50 feet from the doors of the actual movie. She then replied that you still have half the popcorn left and I told her again that I'm getting a refill because I asked for little butter and as she can easily see that the popcorn was floating on top of the popcorn.  She agreed and gave me my popcorn. So it's check out time and I get the bill for drinks, ice cream and the popcorn. Ugh I didn't want to make a scene at the very end of the movie like others and I can wait. The problem is who wants all those distractions of people arguing about their bills in the middle of a movie?  I guess I can see like others in a place offering too much can get too confusing and it's a distraction.  Good luck!!"}
{"text":"Just was there last night. Theatre was good and clean. The service was decent but the food was just alright. Seemed to have the typical bar food type style. I was probably expecting a little more high scale food because after walking in, it just felt like an expensive place.   Vegetarians and Vegans unfortunately need to just stay away if they are hungry. I would go there again but only if I was obligated to go with a friend. My GF and I had a Groupon which made the tickets only $5 each. We saw the new remake of Vacation which needless to say, was just for a money maker deal for Chevy Chase."}
{"text":"I LOVE this movie theater. I've been here quite a few times, including today, so obviously I don't think it's a bad place.   Immediately when you walk in, it smells amazingly fresh scented, not like stale popcorn and dirty carpet. The ambiance is VERY nice. It's swanky and modern. I like that you get to choose your seat at the time of purchase. The price of individual movie tickets isn't expensive at all. The regular price is $10 and student/senior/matinee price is $7.50.   Upstairs, they have a comfortable lounge & bar area. The seats in the theater, as many have already pointed out, are absolutely the best. Very big & plush, like sitting in a recliner at home. I've tried the BBQ pizza before, and it was okay. I've also had the fried chicken tenders with french fries, and that tasted good. i didn't like the nachos, though. However, it still tastes better than regular movie theater food. I do recommend trying out a local restaurant in the area instead, though.  The patrons were quiet during the movie, the picture was clear, and the sound was crisp. Like some have pointed out, the service during the movie is a bit distracting at first,  but it's not too bad. The service was great. They even offer mints as you exit at the end of the movie. They also validate for the Epicentre parking garage for up to four hours, so that saves money & time spent looking for parking on the crowded streets. Also, the bathrooms are very clean. I just wish that they had a larger selection of movies from which to choose."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times now and it seems the quality goes down each time. The bathroom was dirty and they just opened. We could see wires from the row in front of us hanging down everywhere. It seems unclean and our lounge chairs were very squeaky.  The food is always good. Our tea this last time tasted weird. It's pricey but comfortable for a movie."}
{"text":"Yeah, you'll pay a premium for the experience, but it beats the nasty seating and food options at the typical movie theater.  Great place to grab a drink, pizza and enjoy a great flick."}
{"text":"TOO LOUD!!!!  We were excited to see the new Star Wars movie but had to leave because of the volume.  Not only was it louder than the credits startling my daughter enough to cry but our ears are ringing.  It was ear damaging loud, and the theater told us they were unable to turn it down.  I hope studio movie grill does something about the volume.  It used to be such a nice experience.  Very disappointed. One note: the theater did refund ALL our money.  Very accommodating there-I guess their hands were tied with the volume ?."}
{"text":"I love the concept, but really only recommend the drinks. The alcoholic milkshakes are good and the mojito as well. I doubt they will ever get a food order correct. I don't know why they can't bring the correct items, but they can't. Eat before you arrive and just order drinks."}
{"text":"I am really conflicted.  We are regulars at SMG - we drive 15 miles to go to this location.  In almost 5 years of super-great service and food, we had our first not-so-great experience.    First - I'm disappointed with the remodel they did last year - they made the seats smaller (and less comfortable).  The angle now makes it much more challenging to try to juggle drinks, popcorn and meal with your partner.  That's just a minor issue though.  It's still more comfortable than other theaters!  Now, we are more comfortable at the counter.   I get that this is Beauty and the Beast weekend - but we've been there for other huge blockbusters, and have never had a service problem before.  We arrived a few minutes before the previews, and the counters were sticky - very visible huge sticky mess.  It took almost 5 minutes for the server to respond to our light (that was bad timing on our part) and she mentioned that apparently the cleaning crew must have missed that row, because they had that problem with a lot of seats in the area.   We place our orders - and within a few minutes a staff member cleaned up the area for us.  Okay - that could happen.  Not a huge inconvenience.    Our favorite menu items are the coconut chicken tenders.  They are crispy, not oily, plump and moist.  They give you four huge pieces with your choice of dipping sauce.  I give those an A+!  I usually get the regular fries, and my hubby gets the sweet potato fries.  We know to order them extra crispy, and we are willing to wait a few extra minutes to get them.  We ordered popcorn, waters, and an adult milkshake.   Here's where I get disappointed - it took over 20 minutes to bring the water - long after the popcorn was delivered.  Our meals came out and the fries were soggy and cold.  Really?  They even confirmed when they dropped them off that these were the orders with the \"extra crispy\" fries.  After 45 minutes, we turned on the light to get a refill of the popcorn and ask where our adult milkshakes were.  10 minutes later, the light went off - no server, no popcorn refill and no milkshakes.  When they were getting ready to drop off the bills, our original server came over to see if we ever got our shakes, apologized and asked us if we still wanted them - so we passed.  They didn't drop off our bill until the credits.  Cold soggy fries, no popcorn refill, no adult beverage. This was not normal for my SMG team.   Now - I know I could have done something about this - I could have gone out to the lobby to get a manager, or I could have kept turning my light on - but I was really enjoying the show.  But that was three strikes for a venue that typically provides stellar service. But the movie was great!"}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace to movie theaters. The original theater \"Mez\" was great, but as soon as SMG acquired it, things went downhill fast.  We have been going to this location for years but it continues to disappoint time after time.  Every time I decide to give them another chance, it is a bad experience and I walk out with a bad taste in my mouth, LITERALLY!  When SMG acquired Mez they started out by replacing the comfortable sofa seats with these plastic airplane seats. They sacrificed comfort so they can cram as many cheap seats in there as possible. The floors are always sticky and it seems like cleanliness is a secondary priority.  One of the worst aspects of SMG has to be the service.  The staff are consistently slow and appear to have little training in customer service.  On many occasions, I wait 15 or more minutes for someone to arrive and take my order once I hit the call button.  It is pretty distracting when you are watching a movie and wondering where the food you ordered 45 minutes ago is. On one occasion my food never came out but you can bet that I was still charged for the invisible meal!  The drinks are no better. When you want to enjoy a nice cocktail with your movie you typically get a sugary mess made by an amateur bartender.  Oh, and that is after you waited 30 minutes for it to arrive.  No matter how bad the food and drinks are, they will never compensate you for a bad/wrong order.  All you will get is a half-hearted \"sorry about that\" and if you are lucky they will get you a new drink.  Many times they apologize for getting your order wrong and then proceed to do NOTHING! Honestly, the staff here are among the most poorly trained I have ever encountered.  Our most recent experience was the most disgusting.  I ordered a cocktail and I received more than I bargained for...there was a FLY (see photos)  drowning in my drink! That was the last straw for me.  How can something like that get past both the bartender and the waiter who served it to me? I noticed it as soon as they brought it out to me.  What did I get for this extra little surprise? An apology from a random waitress and she replaced my drink.  They did not compensate the drink on my bill, nor did they have the manager speak to me and apologize for what just happened.  If you watch \"Bar Rescue\" you will see that a fly in a drink is a cause to \"SHUT IT DOWN!\". I can just imagine how many of their liquor bottles have little creatures residing in them. Obviously, there is no quality control whatsoever.  In conclusion, this place flat out sucks.  You pay a premium price due to its location in Uptown while receiving amateur service, inedible food, and mediocre drinks with flies in them.  This is not only the worst theater that I have been to, but the worst restaurant that I have been to as well. Have a date and are thinking of going to SMG?....don't.  You can be sure that it would be the last time you saw that person again.  I wish I could give this place 0 of 5 stars.  It is that bad!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a movie theatre/restaurant, and I was pretty pleased! The food was standard fare, decently priced.  I had the chicken nachos, which was a huge serving, but a bit hard to eat in the dark. Probably gonna just order a sandwich the next time I go so I don't have to look down so much and fiddle with scooping and stuff lol. My husband had the grilled cheese with sweet potato fries, which he enjoyed! We both had vanilla milkshakes, which were kinda pricey--around $5.   We watched The Campaign, which was a light-hearted comedy that didn't require too much attention. At the end of the movie, we came to the consensus that we would never come here to watch a serious movie that required a lot of focus, but for a comedy like The Campaign, it was just fine.  The servers were very nice! They did their best to stay out of the way of the screen--poor things were hunched over and scurrying around the entire time!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this concept as I've never been to a dine-in theatre before but it was disappointing. Parking was great and not a problem. There aren't too many movies playing so do t expect the same selection as a normal theater. We got our tickets quickly as well, but ended up only being able to get front row seats. I've done front row seats in a theater before but these in particular were way too close to the screen. There are 2 seat style options. You can choose from a stationary seat like what the typical movie theaters have but it has a small table that swings around in front. The other option was a desk chair that sits at a bar. Since we didn't purchase our tickets earlier, this was the only option and I do not recommend it as it was not comfortable unless you like sitting in an office chair to watch a movie.  We ordered food and I got the California chicken sandwich. What's interesting is this theater prides itself on the food but what I got was mediocre at best. The sandwich bun was soggy and soaked probably from the pico de gallo that was on the bottom of the sandwich. I also ordered a margarita which was terrible. The mix they used was a cheap quality fake lime flavor. I took 2 sips and decided this drink was not worth the calories. Our drinks also came out after our food. Above all, the food and drinks are way overpriced for the quality and value. My bill with tip was around $28 for a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and the margarita.   I wanted to complain and fix the food, but honestly I was afraid if I complained about both my food and beverage being bad, they wouldn't have taken me seriously. I just won't go back. I recommend getting dinner and drinks at a normal restaurant and then going to a theater that has the comfortable reclining chairs instead."}
{"text":"I'm so torn with this place. Between Cinebarre (the other movie/dinner business in Charlotte) and SMG, I prefer SMG mainly because the sound was a LOT better (nothing is worse than trying to hear the movie over someone chewing). Also the seats are so comfy and I actually like having a button to press for the server to come up.   However, both times I've gone now, it's taken the server a ridiculous amount of time to respond to the button. So honestly, I don't really see it as much of a convenience as I would've liked.  The really bad thing is that both times I've gone, I've gotten pretty shoddy service. The servers are SUPER nice but I don't know if it's them or the kitchen but somewhere between me ordering and it getting to me, something goes wrong.  The first time I got my food wrong but it took forever to get a server so I just ate it and made sure my tab was done right.   The second time, our waitress read our order back to us THREE times (and that was at her suggestion, not ours.) Well, first, our food came super quick, but WELL before our drinks. I was halfway through my pizza before I had to stop eating and wait for something to drink. After about 10 minutes, we finally got our drinks. And they were wrong. But we were so thirsty and that had taken so long we just drank them anyway.  Luckily these mistakes weren't terrible. I mean, the wrong food and the wrong drinks were still tasty. But...it's not what I ordered. And it was too difficult to get them justified.  Also, when they bring the check at the climax of each movie, that's a little more than distracting. I wouldn't mind sitting a little longer at the end in order to pay than have a movie possibly ruined.  Overall, I think if they get all their serving/kitchen/bar kinks worked out, it'd be a preferable place for movies and dinner."}
{"text":"I was hugely disappointed when we walked in to what appeared to be a work like environment. Desks? Rolling chairs?  Seriously??? At a movie theatre? We walked right out.  No freaking way. Get with the times: who wants to sit at a desk?  Nope. Nope. Nope. I seriously thought I was being punked. Worst movie \"theatre\" environment ever."}
{"text":"Okay, its 115 degrees outside. WHAT DO YOU DO? WHAT DO YOU DO?! You go on groupon, spend $5 and go to a movie that serves food and alcohol.   Pros: Food and alcohol served to you at your recliner. Nice waiters, nice staff.  Good Popcorn and soda. Fairly cold beer, which makes a sub-par movie bearable.  Cold A/C   Cons: Food is pretty expensive, Pizza is Chuck E Cheese Style Wings are breaded and you get like 5 or 6 for $10 with a wilted stem of celery and some ranch dressing Salad was okay but its hard to see well enough to spear it properly  A good friend once said \"never eat food you can't see\". We were not impressed. Our bill for three people who got a salad, wings, and a pizza was $60 (pitcher of beer was $16). That includes our discounted ticket. YOu will not come out unscathed if you drink. This is not happy hour. BUt you eat at your seat. It's a trade off.  So, if eating and drinking at your seat is important to you, YAY FIVE STARS!!  If good food and fair prices are your thing, eat first, drink first, buy a group and spend $5. TIy get a free drink with that.  (OH, AND THE BREADED WINGS BITE ....IN A BAD WAY)"}
{"text":"If you like watching a movie in a broken office chair then this is the busted down theater for you. They actually managed to find chairs that are less comfortable than an economy airline seat. Trays are broken, seats frayed and it's super dirty with trash shoved down in the cup holders. Trouble sticking to your diet? Not to worry the food will make you lose your appetite."}
{"text":"Had I not been to iPic beforehand, I'd probably give SMG a higher rating. But it's still a decent/fair experience for the price.  The Bad:  chairs don't recline and are smallish, too close together. The screen is not very big, considering the local competition. Pricing for basically a frozen reheated entree is kinda unfair. The Good: Food is tasty, despite the frozen quality. Servers are friendly, attentive and prompt. The lounge is stylish and clean. Men's Bathroom was very clean.  The experience is cheaper than iPic or AMC.  Overall, I didn't hate it, but iPic is by far the first place winner in the movie-dining game."}
{"text":"Please, go literally anywhere else. We went to the movies last night and it took 40 minutes for a glass of wine and popcorn. When I went to go check on the items, they were out of the popcorn (but poke had come to tell me) awful and distracting experience. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"First time there last Saturday. We had a blast! The servers were wonderful, the theater seats are really different (like being in a conference room in a stadium) but super comfortable, and the food was shockingly as good as 90% of the restaurants in Scottsdale. Bravo! Will be back."}
{"text":"My wife said we are going to see a movie and you can get lunch while you watch the movie. Sure, great our son wanted to see planes and its been a while since I saw movie with my son.   I ordered the coconut chicken tinders and they were terrible. I used to work in the kitchen and you can taste when the deep fryer oil has not been changed out and what happens is everything then tastes the same. It was overcooked, the sweet potato fries were soggy and my drink was watered down. Walls are thin and you can hear the other movie room next to yours and it ruins the experience. My son sat in the middle and didn't notice but his mac and cheese came out and it was super salty. He tasted it and said Daddy this does not taste right. I tasted it and called the staff over only to be told, if we get him something else he will only come out 10 mins before the movie starts. I stopped being charming at that point and gave them a new order and that order came out cold and didn't mix well with the Ice cream my wife ordered for them.   The seats are stiff and you can't really get comfortable in them and the other seats are office chairs with long desks in front of them where they pay a little less but I'm guessing the food still sucks.   There is 1 bathroom for the guy and 1 for the gals. In the guys room there are three stand up urinals and 1 stall. Whoever designed this place had no concept of math at all. For the girls room the line went out door and curved around. My daughter almost didn't make it but a few women said go ahead of us.   1. Bad food 2. Bad service 3. Bad bathrooms 4. Bad seats.   Not a bad movie for a 6 year old child. My son really liked it."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is great. The staff is wonderful. Best is when taking your kid to a kid movie you can relax with a little wine or alcoholic beverage and pass out. Just make sure your kid lets you know when your snoring is louder than the movie."}
{"text":"This place has some potential and I think it will work out the kinks as it goes along.  We went on a Friday afternoon to see a movie in 3-D. We had bought a groupon for $5 with a soda. What an awesome deal! And the great thing is, the policy stated that we would be charged extra for 3-D movies. The cashier rung us up and handed us our tickets just as I was getting some cash out. Well, I am not going to speak up about a mistake like that. More money for beer!   I was quite pleased to see that there was some Epicenter on draft, one of our favorite local beers. A pitcher was $15. We showed up a little bit early to ensure that we would get our food and our pick of the seats. Well, we arrived just in time for them to seat us and we were the first ones there. We had the choice of the office chairs with a large continuous desk in front of us or the reminiscent of college classroom seats with the little fold over table. Well, we actually opted for the office chairs with the desk because we had bought a pitcher of beer and we were planning on getting some grub, so we wanted to spread out.   I did notice that a couple of chairs had the \"reserved\" sign on them. I bet those people felt a little ripped off as they walked in and realized that they pretty much had the pick of the theater. One man with his child actually moved from his reserved seat to a better seat.   I ordered the sliders and my guy ordered the chicken strips. We got our food just as the previews were starting. Our food came with a tiny little container of ketchup. I have an unhealthy love for ketchup so I pushed our service button and we got a ton of extra ketchup right away. The service was fantastic. The food, not so much. I had the most boring sliders in my entire life, thank goodness for ketchup. The fries were lightly seasoned and there were so many of them! I felt like I was eating french fries for an hour and still had a good heap left. We were quite stuffed from the meal. About 3/4 of the way through the movie, I was regretting my decision to sit in the office chair as it has no head support. I tried resting my head on the table which didn't really work either.   Overall I gave it a 4 because I was not impressed with the food but the service, the price, and the cleanliness/ambience of the place was wonderful."}
{"text":"I really wanted to see \"How To Train Your Dragon II\" and the iPic didn't have a showing. Wanting a similar experience, my husband and I decided to try Studio Movie Grill. Since I had never been to SMG previously, I had to rely on Yelp reviews in determining the best seats. After my decision was made, I went online and ordered tickets the day before. When I made my purchase, it appeared that only two other seats that were taken. I was under the assumption that the theater would be dead.  When we arrived the day of the show that was the complete opposite. The parking lot, the entrance, and the actual theater were bustling. Families were waiting in the lobby, eating food, and having a good time. Inside the theater, we found our seats and found ourselves trapped between two different families and their children. (Yes, I realize we went to see what is generally thought of as a \"kid's movie\".)  As the previews played, my husband looked at the menu and decided on ordering food. When no waiter came by to take our order, he pressed the red button and within 5 minutes a waiter showed up. We both ordered water and my husband ordered the coconut chicken/shrimp lunch option. Our waters arrived just as the movie had begun playing and about 15 minutes into the movie the food arrived.  The food was okay - nothing special. Average French fries - some were crispy other were limp. The chicken was okay and I didn't try the shrimp. My husband agreed everything was just okay. When we were finished, the dishes sat a while before a waiter came by with the check and took away the dishes.   Overall, SMG pales in comparison to the iPic on all fronts. Yes, it is a slight upgrade from \"regular\" theaters and it's nice you can order food instead of the standard popcorn and such. However, they have this funky setup inside the theater. The rows alternate between two distinctly different types of seating. One row is an elongated desk with office chairs (literally office chairs). The next row contains seats that have trays that swivel in front and to the side. (The material is similar to the leather of office chairs as well.) These chairs did not lean back and were a little disappointing. Needless to say, we did not sit at the desk/office chair row and I didn't see any other folks sitting there as well. I think SMG needs to rethink this and replace those rows with more comfortable seating.  The only other thing this place has going for it is the location. It's relatively close to my work/home and has ample parking. Plus, there are several over restaurants nearby in case you are hungry before/after a show.   I can't say I will definitely be back but it's an option. I like having options."}
{"text":"I was really expecting more of a variety on the menu at SMG; as a vegetarian I rate a place based on, you guessed it, how many veggie options there are. There were not many so we chose the endless pizza. The pizza was okay. I will say the seats were extremely comfortable, and the wait staff was very friendly. The X-Men movie was pretty packed, but we were assisted in a timely manner and our orders were accurate.  I like the fact that you can see which seats are available before purchasing your ticket; that way you know how full the movie is going to be. It was an enjoyable experience, and with $5 deals on Groupon, you really can't beat it. We'll go back definitely."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a date!  My boyfriend took me here on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  We rode the light rail and got off at the EpiCentre stop and walked right up to the theater.  (Very short walk and almost all of it is covered-very helpful if you don't want to be rained on and forgot your umbrella like we did.)  The entryway of the theater is really nice, great lighting and the smell is very nice too.  You purchase or show your tickets to the desk at the entryway and then take the escalator up to the second floor.  We sat at the bar for about a half hour before our movie-the girl behind the bar was so sweet and gave us plenty attention.  The ordering process is straightforward.  You have a small red button on a small table attached to your chair.  (Kind of like a college lecture hall desk.)  You pick what you want on the menu, push the service button and a server appears.  They quickly input your order using an iPod touch and your food arrives shortly.  The food was good-I did a rather easy meal of sweet potato fries and chicken tenders.  Beware of the drink holders-yes, there are drink holders.  They are on the front left side of your table.  It is a bit awkward.  Also, there isn't a ton of room if you have to get up and leave the theater while you have food on your table, so be careful.  The movie we went to see was really upsetting so we left the theater before we were able to pay for our food.  I went to the bar outside and ordered a drink while my boyfriend stayed behind to see about paying for our food.  He explained why we left the theater and they gave him a few $5.00 movie passes.  We spend the rest of the afternoon at the bar!  I'm really looking forward to going back and actually staying for the entire movie.  :)"}
{"text":"I totally love this place. You can pick your seats before going in which is awesome. You can eat and drink while watching your favorite movie. Can't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Today was my first here but it won't be my last! The in seat dining service is great. You press a button and within minutes someone shows up to take your order and they bring you your check to sign towards the end of the movie. I had the seared ahi tuna and it was fantastic. The recliner was so comfy, by far the comfiest of any I've sat in in a theater in this area. Originally my ticket was for the back row but the theater was almost empty so I changed seats on my own -- the back row is pitch black, I wanted a little bit of lighting. Doubt that I would ever book a seat in one of the desk chair rows though, would not be the same comfy experience the recliners are. The screen height was perfect, the sound and volume were perfect, just a really great and yet different movie going experience. The only drawback to me is the location is about 25 miles away from my house so it's a bit of a hike for me. While it won't be a regular movie going location for me, I will definitely go back. It is worth the drive on occasion."}
{"text":"Super comfy place to watch a movie. We come here often because there are many opportunities to get cheap tickets. They often have Groupons for $5 ticket and soda. And any movie after 10pm is only $5.  The food is good but pricey. I had the veggie quesadilla and it was very tasty. But $12. My husband had the burger and said it was good too. Drinks are also very expensive. I guess that's the trade off for being able to drink and eat in a theater. We usually eat beforehand and stick to popcorn and drinks but we are sure to tip our servers well since we aren't ordering a lot of food.   The staff is nice, the seats are comfy and not sardine packed into the theater. If you go on an opening weekend, get your tickets about an hour early and hit a bar or restaurant nearby..."}
{"text":"The only way to see a movie!!! I know some people may get annoyed with the servers coming in and out of the theater during the movie; but they are super stealth in my opinion. I only knocked one star, because the chairs aren't the most comfortable. But overall, a wonderful experience here!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this establishment @ least once a year since 2009 and have NEVER had the type of customer experience I had today. Went to watch the 1145 showing of War for the Planet of the Apes.  It was myself and a Friend sitting in theater 6 J9 and J10 with one other person sitting in J4. Several times the gentelmanan in J4 was texting, and one occasion was actully on the phone during the movie.  There were a couple of times I had the waiter come in to replace/refill our drinks. On a couple of the occassions the waiter and or server that brought our drinks never once asked the gentleman to put his phone away.  After the movie I approached a manager and brought my concern of not being able to fully enjoy the show because of the individual and was rudly put off with him saying, \"if I had brought it to there attenrion sooner then he WOULD have done something.  This place has servers in and out of the movie through out the duration of the movie. They should have said something to the gentleman or to there manager. It not like Harkins or most AMC'S that dont offer a dine while watching a movie.  This gave me a very bad impression of this establishment and how they view a customers complaint.  I am a Premire member with AMC and will after this take my money and loyalty to them. They do have two locations that offer food while you watch a movie and I will go to those if I want ro dine @ the same time I want to see a movie."}
{"text":"Neat concept. I thought the food was very good. The service was excellent. I would agree with a previous comment about the bathroom. The men's room had an attendant there and he kept it up. The ladies room had no attendant and my wife said it was disgusting."}
{"text":"I did not know that service this bad existed. To start my chair was not secured to the floor so within the first five minutes of the movie I leaned back only to have my cup of ice water fall all over me and soak my seat. I then asked for a new cup of water and waited about 45 minutes until it arrived. My friend and I decided to split the duo dip, they came out on time but weren't super tasty. We then ordered the grilled chicken tenders with the sauces of our choice. The chicken tenders came, the sauces did not. We asked if we could have the sauces and were told that they would be right out. So we waited and we waited... The chicken got cold and the sauces never came. I then ordered a vanilla milkshake only to be told they were out of vanilla ice cream. Finally when the check came we charged for the sauces that were never delivered, we requested that they be taken off.... They weren't. Around the same time we could hear music blaring through the walls from the bar next door... Not ideal for the ending scenes of the movie. All in all it was kind of horrible but Amy Schumers movie was still quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"Seats and theatre are really nice - huge comfortable chairs, however I do agree that the drink holder is in a very awkward position.   Food is pricey, which is expected - but not worth half of what it costs. It actually made one if us sick later in the night.  Everyone was really nice until our 2nd server came. She was terribly rude and even got our order wrong.   I would go back for a movie, but would never order any food - not even the popcorn again.  I miss Mez - better food, better service and better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Found out about this place by listening to XM Radio 72 On Broadway, where we learned about the showing of an Australian stage production of \"Drivng Miss Daisy,\" starring Angela Lansbury, James Earl Jones and Boyd Gaines, so we went on line and found that it was at this theatre near us yesterday.  How fortunate that it was also at a theatre with food table service and a full bar!  We went to the bar and got a pint of Blue Moon each while we waited for the film to start, which ended up starting late due to the theatre not being cleaned yet.  We had to wait awhile for that to happen.  Finally we were seated and ordered our food before the film started, but then we were interrupted several times during the viewing by the server to get the food, the check and make the payment.  We had gotten our tickets on Fandango and arrived early so that we could finish eating before it started but we were not allowed in the theatre.  I understand that this was a special one-time only showing but it should have been better organized.   Seats were very comfortable.  The barbecue chicken pizza I ordered was enough for a meal, and was very tasty.  My wife had the blackened chicken salad with ranch dressing, which she thought was fine, but she was still hungry later (must be all that rabbit food she eats ;-). We both had another Blue Moon too.  The film was outstanding and is the reason for the high rating--we felt we were in the presence of stage greatness as we laughed and cried along with these amazingly accomplished actors.."}
{"text":"The food is better than expected when considering movie food in general, but get there early to get your food in a decent amount of time. I usually opt for one of their desserts. Tuesdays all movies are $5."}
{"text":"Had a relatively poor experience.  I was attending a business presentation with lunch and a movie; the theater we were in was basically a long desk with office chairs.  Not sure if the rest of theaters were this way, but this one was.  Unfortunately there were two major flaws, the first was that after three hours the seats became rather hard and uncomfortable.  The second issue was that there were lights under the desk and the result was an LED directly in your sight line with the movie screen.  This itself is pretty inexcusable and I couldn't find a way to shut it off so I made a makeshift barrier with material around me so it didn't completely ruin the experience.    Service was also questionable.  Initially they seemed attentive and very fast with the food but they skipped our row when ordering and only came back after serving the entire theater, and even after that they still missed me.  They took the order of the lady next to me but then ran off, never to return.  At first I waited to see if they would come back, then it became a game and then eventually I decided I didn't really need the calories.  So in the end I was served a drink and then over the next three hours I never saw a server again.  Ultimately I would go to one of the other food & movie theaters or just go to a regular theater before I would return."}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grille offers a lot more than your average movie theater. The fact that \"Grille\" is part of its name should have already tipped you off. Sure, you can come here and order popcorn and your average soft drinks. But who WOULDN'T be tempted by the decent list of adult beverages, full-fledged meals, and hot, made-to-order appetizers?   My husband and I caught a 6:30 pm movie over the weekend and showed up 20 minutes early to grab some dinner before our show. We couldn't have been more satisfied, and honestly pleasantly surprised at the quality and taste. Hubby got the California burger (complete with guacamole and chipotle mayo) and sweet potato fries. I went with the coconut chicken fingers and regular fries. Both were great options; both were clearly freshly made; both were served by a very friendly server. I was glad we came early because we were basically done with our food when the movie really got started; I'm personally not a fan of eating in the dark.   People complain about the servers interrupting their view of the movie and that the service is slow. If you're bothered by the occasional person walking below you or to the side (never directly in front of you, thanks to the strategically placed, comfortable stadium chairs), then my advice is simple: go to a regular movie theater, people. For everyone else who enjoys a tasty, unique movie snack and beverage, Studio Movie Grille is well worth the visit. (Bonus tip: Groupon typically has great deals.)"}
{"text":"I don't love going to the movies, i have no idea why...but I like it here. You can order your tickets online and have the email on your phone for them to scan or you can purchase there like your normal movie theater. The mix of seating is important, you don't want a counter seat. Those are literally the same experience as sitting at a conference table and your chair will roll around the whole feature. I recommend getting any other seat. Since your seat is pre-picked you an swing by the bar on your way in and enjoy a bev before going into your movie. Once you are in your seat, you an order anything off the menu. Everything I have had here is good, I really don't think the prices are high either especially for a movie theater. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great experience, the seats are fantastic and picture quality was above none. I am giving this a 2 because we paid $55 for food and drinks that were trash. The burger was not cooked all the way and the pizza came out soggy. My girl and I was disappointed in the drinks. The GJ double came out like a shot and the margarita on the rocks was all juice. We will be back to watch a movie but will make sure to eat before hand."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would!!! Worse place to come if you want to order food drinks or even use the restroom and have paper !! The seats are uncomfortable too!!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I hit the jackpot with a had new babysitter. We wanted to go see a movie and have dinner, but not be out for hours. Studio Movie Grill combines the two AND they have a full bar. Aaaahaa, sold already! We had some strong drinks for happy hour at the bar before our movie started. Since we had reserved our seats, its was nice to not have to rush into the theatre to secure a good shop spot. I will also mentioned that we were there on a Monday and got extra special care because there weren't a lot of traffic. The food we ordered was plentiful, delicious, and perfect for movie watching. The theatre chairs were comfortable, but wish they reclined. If we are luck enough to get a sitter again, you know where you'll find us."}
{"text":"smg i quit stop hiring ghetto lazy ppl with horrid customer service!!!"}
{"text":"We got passes from GroupOn and they were just about to expire so we decided to take in a movie. When we got there, the line was almost out the door. It looked like everyone who had a GroupOn coupon chose to go that day because their coupon was also about to expire. There were four cash registers and only two cashiers which made the wait unbearable. Where is the manager, he should be helping them out and getting the patrons into the theater. After about 20-25 minutes, we finally made it to the ticket taker with only 10 minutes to go before showtime. She made us wait with some other couples because they didn't know if there were going to be customers with reserved seating. Come ON!! That's pretty lame excuse for not letting us in.  When we finally made it in, we sat in the first row of the comfortable seats, but in front of us, there was a counter with chairs on rollers and desk lights which I thought was going to turned off once the movie started. NOPE!! As the movie started, the employees were so distracting because they had to bring all the food, popcorn and drinks out. Even though they ducked as they passed back and forth in front of you, you couldn't help but see them in the corner of your eye. You can order the popcorn with hot butter which came in a container  and not a bag. The hot butter was in a cup and you had better pay attention when you poured the butter less you get it all over your clothes. The sound system was great and the theater was clean. I'd give it another chance but maybe not on a weekend."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with a Groupon which is a GREAT deal! Also they validate parking for 4hrs. I have 0 complaints. The chicken fingers are super yummy and the seats are comfortable."}
{"text":"Typically, I dislike going to the movies.  Usually the seats are uncomfortable, the view gets blocked by someone in front of you, and the snacks leave something to be desired.  SMG fixes all of these.  The seats are quite comfortable.  They are wide with large armrests and they recline (but do not maintain that position).  All of the seats I have tried have not been had the view blocked by someone.  There are also two main types of seats those behind a counter and those with moveable tables.  The food at SMG is also very good quality, and they have a varied menu.  They have standard popcorn and sodas (Pepsi products), but they also have appetizers, flat breads, sliders, desserts.  I have had their wings, and I am a fan of the red hot sauce.  There are free refills on soda/water.  The prices are good to begin with, and there are frequently GroupOns available to make it even more reasonable."}
{"text":"Theater was very warm, service was slow and order was incorrect yet we were billed for things we sent back. Ice cream was warm by the time we got spoons. Went to see Batman and this was do bad I think I will go to Ipic and see it again. I wasn't really a fan of the office chairs and thought they could have done a better job with the layout. People were walking in front of us the whole time the movie was on.  I didn't complain at the theater because we aren't coming back and free passes, etc... Would have been useless.  I hate to see a place try so hard to change things up and yet get it so wrong."}
{"text":"Was here for a Yelp event and although they have a little tweaking to do I was really impressed. We were given samples of the food and drinks before our movie. The Blue margarita was really good to me, it tasted sorta like blue raspberry kool aid mixed with a touch of lemonade.  the pizza was really good, not sure which one it was (and i apologize for the blurry pictures on the menu but for some reason certain pages would not take a clear picture- but I took the pictures so you could see the prices). the pizza had ham and mushrooms and a few other toppings. and was so good! crust not to thick. very even throughout each bite with ratio to toppings and crust. bacon wrapped scallops, have a feeling they were previously frozen- but that does not bother me since Charlotte is not a coastal city it would be expensive to get fresh each day. Any-who they were delicious coconut chicken- i was shocked how good this was since I ate it before I knew what it was- I am NOT a fan of coconut at all.  Theater is large and with an amazing screen. Very modern with large comfy seats that have arm rest, cup holder, table and the seats lean back a little and they ROCK. you feel like you are sitting in a large recliner. you also have a service button in case you need to call your server.   now for the hard part of this review. I understand they are new and still in training of how to do things but this is where the 1 star fell off. it took a long time for them to come take the order and the movie had started. She took our entree, drink and dessert order all at once. And this happened to lots of others as well. This is a kink that needs fixing. Others received their food way before us and it was someone different who brought the food and brought all of it at the same time. NOW all you have is this small college type table (you know the little table in a college classroom) so I had to send the dessert back since I had no place to put it.  shortly after our food came our bill- Why? what if we were going to order additional items? this made no sense, and actually i did have to order my wine later.  They never came back to refill my water or check if everything was correct. Another kink.  the food though was again super! I had the ribs with fries and added a side of cheese (the cheese I received was something like Velveeta melted down with red peppers and green Chile peppers at a pot luck dinner appetizer) it was good but hard to manage. The ribs were tender and smoky, lightly sauced with a sweet/smoky sauce. They send you 6 individual ribs with a Good bit of meat on them. The fries came out hot and crispy, these are the seasoned shoestring type fries.  The dessert was huge- as you can tell by the picture- and definitely made for sharing. the chocolate frosting is VERY rich. So if you are a chocolate lover this is for YOU. At the end there was a lot of confusion with the servers and checks. Some servers were still bringing out desserts after people had left. Some waiting on there checks etc.  The servers were doing their best- but just were not equipped to handle such a large group. A few suggestions is to take orders before the movie, have servers that are assigned to certain areas so that there is less communication errors. once food is served have the server come back to inquire if drinks need refilling or if the entree is as requested. Again come back to remove any dishes and ask for dessert/drink order then. Once dessert is served present the check at the same time and then return a little later to remove dishes and check.  Other than the few kinks in service that need tweaking this was a great night. I love the concept and hope to return soon"}
{"text":"Love the $5 wine and $10 all you can eat pizzas. Although the first pizza we got was a good size, the second one was a bit smaller. Didn't mind it though because we were full. Tickets are good deal if you get the $5 groupon."}
{"text":"Really like this place. The seats are pretty uncomfortable but the food is great. Also might need to cash out your 401k if you're bringing a date here."}
{"text":"This place is such a rip off. They rob you blind. I ordered the same drink 3 times and was charged 3 different prices. Thought maybe it was just that bar tender so I had my friend get me the same beer that he had just paid 6.50 for and a different bar tender charged him 7.50. When I complained to management they asked me to leave because they were afraid I was gonna cause a scene. Will never spend my money in this place ever again. General manager Aldo brozzetti was a joke as well. I explained to him that my friend paid 7.50 for my beer and 6.50 for his and he took it out my hand and gave me 8 dollars and asked me to leave. Would put no stars if I could"}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is as good a place to see a movie as just about any other theater, plus the food and full bar and being able to select your seat online are phenomenal compliments.  SMG's ticket prices are equivalent to standard cinemas in the valley, and the food prices are on par with an average family restaurant, so really it's about the same as going to a standard dinner and a movie in the long run.  There's always a deal on Groupon or some other discount site, so it's pretty easy to save a few bucks, as well.  The lobby is has a pretty cool set up.  It feels more like a lounge than a movie theater.  There's a bar and some big couches and tables.  If it weren't for the box office, you'd could theoretically just hang out and would never know there were movies playing just feet from your seat.  The theater has a decent set up as well.  Each row alternates between a big leather chair with a tray table in front of it, or a bar with an office type chair.  I've only sat in the big chairs, which are comfortable, however you will need to lean forward to eat in the dark or risk making a big mess on yourself.  I can't tell you what the office chairs are like.  I would guess it's easier to get, but less comfortable overall.  I only wish the ground were angled more.  Stadium seating is the only thing the auditoriums are sorely missing.  The screen and sound system are digital and crystal clear."}
{"text":"This is the best way to watch a movie!! Great service and comfortable seating. At first i was not sure of the office chairs, but I now prefer those to the standard theatre seating. As far as food goes, we have many favorites- quesadillas, nachos ( messy but good) , hot chocolate chip cookies and sliders. We have tried the chicken tenders and they seemed like they came out of a bag. The popcorn is good, just make sure to ask for it with hot butter. Free refills on sodas and ice tea and you never have to get up. Watch for groupons as well."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, facilities were clean, and service was prompt. Better than average movie theatre food options. They offer a deal for $25 where you can pick two entrees and an appetizer. Of what we ordered, we really enjoyed the coconut chicken tenders. They also validate parking (up to 4 hours) from the epicenter garage so be sure to bring that with you!"}
{"text":"It's a nice movie theater for a date but I miss the regular walk in sit watch a movie go to dinner or walk around the mall. This place is a one stop shop it causes date night to lose it's pazas plus the customer service is sub par everytime I go there's something wrong with my order. I know I don't have to order to watch a movie but why go here if your not going to par take in the dine in experience plus I live I north side so by the time I drive down I used enough time and gas I could have invested it into a nice dinner and movie closer to home."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place!  We decided to take the kids out for a fun evening and what would be better than dinner and a movie!  Too bad we all ended up with bad stomach aches!  I don't want to get too graphic but my husband was in the bathroom all night!   SMG, you really need to address the situation in the kitchen before your place ends up shutting down.   We definitely won't be back to this place!"}
{"text":"Walked into this theater and was shown a picture of the chairs in the theater. You must be joking... office chairs and airplane seats in Scottsdale?! Would it hurt to spring for better chairs? I can go to an AMC theater near me with a bar and reclining seats. And I don't have to drive 20 minutes to get there. Terrible."}
{"text":"Fair Warning: If you like being distracted with movie goers ordering food then asking 20 mins later where's their food, servers walking/stomping up and down the aisles taking orders, delivering food, and finally the check, then having mobile phone flashlights shine in your peripheral vision when customers sign their bills...this all taking place throughout the ENTIRE movie, this place is for you. To top it off, the ladies bathroom was filthy with flooded sinks dripping on the wet floor (see photos). They eventually closed off the ladies room and when I asked if there was another bathroom we could use, I was told no, this was the only bathroom. They finally had to let the ladies take turns using the men's bathroom. Thank goodness!   We are visiting & staying at a hotel across the way and decided to watch The Accountant on Sat 11/5 @ 8pm. Movie was great, theater...ummm not so much. Give this place a skip if you can."}
{"text":"This is a great place.   They run amazing deals like GroupOn $5 for a movie ticket and soda (I don't recommend anyone drinks soda with HFCS), but I digress. They also have charity days where you can bring in a canned food item for free admission.   Now, down to the nitty gritty. Nice theatre, much better than most brew and views I've been to. The seats could be more comfortable, they recline but then they bounce right back. The other seating is just like your computer office desk at home. The food is hit or miss. They failed to declare that the grilled cheese is actually more like american plastic cheese sandwich. The other food was good, but the service is rather fail. Ordered the 4 appetizer combo, and they came out with three items. Yet again no apologies, what is with service these days?   The screens are great and just like a regular movie theatre, it just sucks when they fail to dim the lights until half way through the movie. It makes the 3D glasses reflect like crazy. Overall it's worth a go, a bit pricy (for the food/drinks) but enjoyable none the less. I just bought 10 movie passes on GroupOn. Oh Yeah."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, with the exception of the girl at the ticket office. Seats were very comfortable.  Overall a nice ambiance with personable attendees who were very sweet to us. I had the ice cream sundae, which was DELICIOUS. Will definitely be back to visit!! Great experience"}
{"text":"Love the convenience of the entire visit. The seating was excellent and so was the food and drinks. Service was excellent and discreet not to bother the other patrons. It's my absolute favorite place to see a movie"}
{"text":"Went last night, 8/7 and saw my first movie there. Bought tickets on Groupon which was a great deal. Paid the extra fee to reserve seats online, glad we did because line to get tickets was very long. Seats were super comfy and movie theater had a great ambiance about it. We ordered popcorn and 2 drinks and that took about 20 minutes to get to us. They brought checks out about 30 minutes before the movie ended, put our debit card in and handed back to server. The movie ended and we still did not have our check and debit card back. We had to go and track down our server, as with half of the movie theater. That was a nightmare in a theater. Overall, seats were great, food was good, but service not so much. Haven't decided if I will return or not..   -The validate your parking ticket which is a huge plus though!"}
{"text":"7/11/12  Since the Yelp Magic Mike event, I've been back to see two movies- Ted on Tuesday ($5.50 for any movies starting after 10p) and The Amazing Spider-Man 3D ($12 for the 930p viewing) tonight.  The regular seats that fill the theaters here are actually quite comfy without foot rests for my 5'0\" frame (although reclining seats would still be optimal!), and the seats are spacious enough to allow me to sit however I choose to do so, lotus position, or whatever.  For those of you with much longer legs than me, just grab a swivel-chair in front of you and use it as a foot rest; After the opening-day hype dies down, I'm sure this won't be a problem.  I don't know what kind of 3D technology this theater uses, but the pair of glasses handed to me was one of the better types I've come across.  And may I say kudos for the LARGE placard asking patrons not to walk out of the theater with them?  Of course, it would be nice if someone was actually manning the doors to retrieve the pairs (I hate recycling practically brand-new pairs of glasses when someone else can use them-- just wipe them off first, please!).  Hey, how about having a receptacle allowing us to drop them off?  I gave mine to a passing server outside the room."}
{"text":"Even though it's downtown they'll let you have free parking as long as you tell the people up front. Really enjoyed this concept since we don't have a theater like this back home. Anyone who gets annoyed by the servers/customers should expect something like that going in. They have to do their job and get people their food. That being said, I was able to focus on the movie and enjoy my food (which was reasonably priced) so I loved this place."}
{"text":"Went to the Studio Grill for the first time the other day with my kids. My little ones are 3 and 4 and we have never made it through a full movie till now and I am pretty sure it was due to the environment. We ordered food and everything was good and reasonably priced. I however would not recommend the mac and cheese. All in all very fun."}
{"text":"The service here was NOT the best. The first server Michelle was very nice. HOWEVER, the overall service was awful. The food was lukewarm. The worst part...we asked for a refill and it took over an HOUR!!! For a refill. Not a new order, no new check needed. We asked 4 people for refills. And we got our refill.....when the movie was over!!!! This theater is overrated! Eat before you go. Better yet, just go to a different theater with more reasonably priced food and reclining seats."}
{"text":"Crap show of epic proportion....busy holiday week 1 guy selling tickets...movie says 8:15 standing in the hallway being told the theater is not cleaned yet...it's 8:15...go upstairs to check in where they tell you to go outside and downstairs to validate your parking and choose your seats.  The girl at the podium feilding complaints jist told someone if they want to bring outside food they need to just sneak it in in their bag...another complained of wrong food and wants a refund for the food they paid for but necer got...have been waiting 30+ min...csr at the podium says \"well it's not unusual for this place\"....bathrooms are gross...another customer complaining that she has a spicy dish and never got her beverages and no one ever came back to her."}
{"text":"We visited the Studio Movie Grill because we had a Groupon. It was only $5 for a movie ticket, which is awesome considering the movie theater is pretty amazing!  Location: This one is in north Scottsdale, which was quite a drive for us, but I think it was worth it.  Service: Everyone was VERY very friendly, even to the point of stopping us in the hall to thank us for our business.   Prices: The price of the movie ticket wasn't bad, but the food was outrageously priced and wasn't the best. The chicken nuggets were just pre-made strips that were reheated. I had the black bean mushroom burger and it was good, but lacked flavor.  Tips: Choose the seats that are labeled white with hearts. They're the comfy chairs. The others are rolling office chairs. They have $2 movies in the summer! So cool!"}
{"text":"Great seats. Food is average.  Prices on food are high.   Go for the movies and the lounge seat and it's great. Service is average, high school kids. Hit or miss.  It's nice for a date night.  Beer and a movie."}
{"text":"This place is great....cheaper than IPIC better than Harkins and AMC and they serve you whenever you hit a button. Find the deals in Groupon."}
{"text":"A little pricey.. But as long as you Groupon your tickets for $6 each it's we worth it. $12 for tickets. $20 for a pitcher of Dos Equis. Doesn't get better than that!!!"}
{"text":"I wish that yelp would let you not leave any stars at all because the service is horrible. Both times I have been have been for special events on the restaurant side and both time I was extremely disappointed. The customer service is horrible. There were only few of us who showed up for he event but the bar was already nasty. I sat there for 10 minutes before the bartender even addressed me. Against my better judgement (since my 1st trip here went so bad) I decided to give them another chance and place a order. When I ask the bartender for a menu he gave me the nasty menu which had been sitting in whatever liquid was on the bar and proceeded to tell me it was clean instead of just giving me a dry menu. He immediately asked me to pay or stated he would have to hold my credit card so just like that Studio grille missed out on Getting anymore money from me. The only reason I stayed is bc I paid for parking. Honestly I love this place in order cities but Charlotte's will not see me again!!! To add insult to injury the bartender is being very disrespectful to the few guest who are here to patronize and when I spoke to the manager he didn't really seem to care. Maybe you will fair better with a movie but I feel like they owe me a tip for even coming to this establishment."}
{"text":"I am not sure what changed but the experience I had this week at SMG left a lot to be desired.   The two major highlights of choosing this theater were that they sell $5 tickets on Tuesdays and will still validate parking in the Epicentre garage. Cheap ticket (and my favorite - reserved seating) to see a movie and free parking are still something to make SMG worth investigating.   However my experience with the theater itself was lackluster. We met our friends by the bar and I went up to order the theme drink advertised on line only to find it not on the menu. When the bartender asked me what I would have I felt sheepish asking for \"the last rose petal\" but thankfully he knew what I meant. The bar was super sticky but the bartender was friendly and efficient.  When we went to our seats, a few minutes before show time, I noticed sticky floors. Our menus were so sticky we had trouble opening them.  Are you sensing a theme? There was definitely a theme.   Their 2 for $25 special that was listed online was missing from this menu. The waitress didn't come around to get our order until after the movie started despite the usual long line of previews. I ordered a popcorn and a glass of wine and settled into the movie.  After 30 minutes my friend's food and my wine came out but no popcorn for me. Service was unorganized with people's food and drinks coming out separate so I waited another 15 minutes to ask about my popcorn. The waitress was nice enough to follow up on it right away and I received my popcorn 1 hour into the movie. Which is a pretty ridiculous wait time for buttered popcorn.  Maybe it is because we sat in the back row this time but I found the servers much more distracting than I remembered previously. They were up and down the stairs with their electronic devices and flashlights consistently through the first half of the movie and then again at the end to settle up checks. Most of the workers were trying to minimize the light but I still found it distracting.   All said, would I return? For $5 movie nights sure. I just have no inclination to choose this theater in particular."}
{"text":"My wife took the kids to the show and dinner. She said the place was pretty cool and had good offerings. However, two of the six children ate nachos and those two both ended up vomiting later that night. It was definitely pinned on their nachos. The bigger negative was that she called to speak with management, namely to see if others had similar issues, and they never ever returned her phone call. That's rather weak of management to do when trying to establish a new brand. I'm going to go this Friday and check it out for myself...but I won't order any nachos. I'll update after my attendance."}
{"text":"Mediocre theater. If you like uncomfortable seats or enjoy watching a movie sitting at a desk in an office chair with wheels, then this is your place. Spend the extra dollars and go to IPIC instead."}
{"text":"The movie theater was spacious and the screen was big.  There's a bar inside which provided you with a variety of basic drafts and cocktails.  Compared to a lot of the other studio movie grills they have a lounge area which kind of gives you a club atmosphere.    The seats were comfortable and you get to choose tour seats before you purchase your ticket which is a plus! My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night to watch Fury and this movie had a lot of action going on but during those quiet scenes you can definitely hear the clubs around the corner since their music was blasting.  I would seriously suggest watching a movie during the day instead of the evening unless you don't mine hearing club music during your theater experience.   My only reason for a four star besides the walls being thin is because the waitor lost my boyfriend's debit card.  This is like every person's nightmare! I know it's an honest mistake but they really need to be more careful.  We were understanding and were upset but the manager and the crew working took full responsibility.  For them to continue looking and taking action to make sure they didn't misplace it meant a lot to us.  They continued to look in every station and up and down all the rows in our movie theater which gave us a little peace of mind that they did care about our service.  Overall I would recommend this place for anyone who wants a dinner and a movie but I suggest you bring cash only of you're going to order some grub."}
{"text":"Went here again for dinner and a movie.  I had the turkey burger, which was quite good, with the sweet potato fries.  My husband indulged in the Wednesday all you can eat pizza special.  For a little less than 10 dollars, you can choose any pizza on the menu.  They offer diet Dr. Pepper in addition to diet Pepsi for a little more variety. Service was good throughout the movie.  Upgrade 1 star!"}
{"text":"Cool concept. Shitty Food. Comfortable seating. That is about all I remember about this place. The theater was nice and it was cool for everyone to have their own call button to have employees bring you food. The only problem is that the food was subpar. I mean it is a movie theater so what do you expect, but still.  This place is constantly on Groupon. If you want to check it out at least get a groupon so you don't commit a lot of money to an only decent experience. Thinking back it could have been a better experience if I wasn't stuck watching some movie where Channing Tatum is the main character of a romance movie. Spare me."}
{"text":"The best thing about this dine in theater? You can go with as many people as you want. They've been opening up these places pretty fast, and I haven't had a chance to check them all out, but a few that I've been to have the seats arranged in pairs. Which is incredibly awkward if three of you want to go see a movie, and pretty much not good if you want to go with more than one other person. Not this one. The theater seats are arranged in rows. Every two rows has one walking area. The back row has chairs, all next to each other, with little tables that swing over the chair, kinda like how college desks work, but a bigger space. The front row is like a long bar with rolly chairs to sit in. (the downside i saw being that the area isn't divided well so some rolly chairs were taking up more room, leaving other spots along the row squished) We sat in a back row and chatted with our neighbors, whom we didn't know. I found it to be comfortable and fun.   As our first time, we harassed the waiter with questions, which he was happy to answer.  You can order from the kids menu without being a kid Once you order a soda, it's free refills, and they will even let you switch between sodas (so get a coke, then refill with sprite). Splitting meals between people is no problem And there is a light up button on your table, so you can order whenever, request refills, anything. But if you don't hit the button, they will leave you completely alone.   The only downside is that they drop off the bill maybe 45 min from the end. And if you don't pay they keep wandering over to check. I get that they have a theater full of people and they don't want you to run out and get lost in the crowd without paying, but it was pretty distracting (especially since my friend and i were on the same tab and needed to figure out how we wanted to divide the bill).   Overall decent food, good selection, not cheap, but they are flexible with the menu if you are on a budget.   *I went for a sneak peak viewing of 21 jump street, which meant that my movie was free, but we paid for any food, etc."}
{"text":"This movie theater usually has great service, but tonight my drink came almost a half an hour after I began eating. I don't know if it is the staff or whatever, but tonight was an awful example of extraordinary service. This has been one of the worst nights to watch a movie since the staff was either confused or whatever. I feel like the service could have been far better..."}
{"text":"I purchased the Groupon (several by accident but this was a Groupon issue not a studio movie grill one). I called the Scottsdale number and also emailed them that I over purchased Groupons. And I was both emailed and called by management (I wish I would have taken the name he apologized for taking two days to reply in person!)  Continued: we've gone to three more showings since this review was started. It's been that great. Comfortable seating. Management fixed an issue we had with no hassles at all and threw in two passes as well. Ok you're going to spend for the food, then again drinking a margarita while eating hot wings during a show is awesome! Everyone should go once at least!   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CHECKING GROUPON FOR GREAT DEALS HERE!"}
{"text":"We went to see a viewing of an old classic movie...  I thought it would be a fun way to spend a rainy evening.  The movie itself was great, but the experience was dampened by the food we had  :-(  It's a good idea, but the taste has to be there to make this whole deal work."}
{"text":"A fun spot with kiddos and minus the apathetic, and not-helpful ticket taker, the staff in the theater that took our order and brought food was very helpful and friendly. There needs to be a better way to indicate which movie they are seating though since the screens only show a countdown to the movie times (which we already know) so everyone keeps walking up to the already grumpy ticket taker to ask if their movie is seating. This of course makes her more annoyed. The seats are fairly comfortable and the food isn't too bad though floors and tray tables could all use a good scrubbing...expect some sticky surfaces."}
{"text":"First impression was pretty good.  The movie theater was pretty comparable with a normal theater with the exception of seating.  The chairs and table remind me more of a lecture room in college than a movie theater.    The service started out pretty good before the show, but after it started service was poor.  The idea was fun though and it's nice to have a different option for the weekend.  It was refreshing to have decent prices on food and drinks compared to a normal theater."}
{"text":"Uncomfortable seats, overpriced food and somewhat decent service. Had to wait quite a while after pushing our button when we were the only ones in the theatre. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place. Very comfortable seating and great food options. they also have reasonable priced tickets!"}
{"text":"The movie theater is pretty much exactly as advertised with reasonably priced movies uptown with the chance for a meal and drinks while you're watching. The food selection is slightly better than bar food and the prices are pretty reasonable as well. They have Groupons for $5 movies fairly often and you can reserve your seat ahead of time making the whole process much simpler (there is a $1 fee for reserving the seat). Great place for dinner and a movie."}
{"text":"Took 45 mins to receive my order. When I said something they took it away and I received it back in 5 mins. I assume they just reheated it. Also poor customer service. One of the main servers were super rude."}
{"text":"So SMG was just \"okay\" to me. The food selection is great but quality I wasn't too impressed with. You should be sure to check the menu in the bar and decide on something before going in and settling down to watch your movie. The light available in the theater is not enough to even read the menu. Likewise, it's not enough to see the food your eating very well or to sign a check and write in a tip.  The negatives above aside, the seats are the best available in the theater world. Something akin to a La-Z-Boy recliner with a swivel table and drink holders big enough to hold your liter-o'-cola. Assigned seating is also great because it ensures you don't need to line up and fight tooth and nail to claim the best seat in the house. Service was excellent too. I can't think of why, but the server we had was cheerful and ever ready to do her job of risking her life up and down stairs in the darkness to bring us our lukewarm meals and room temperature soggy sweet potato fries.  The movie quality and lighting in the theater is perfect, as expected. But the one thing that enhanced my experience (and mind you plays no role whatsoever in the quality of my review) was the intensely rude guy behind me. Well, I honestly found him hilarious but in that \"are you serious!?\" kinda way. He spent the whole movie burping, farting, munching audibly and kicking my chair continuously. Your mom let you go out in public? Hahaha!"}
{"text":"I tend to love this set up and liked it better as Theater 5.  The food that we have had there is far below what it was and it's super expensive for what it is.  I love the idea but the food should step up a bit.  We had an especially poor experience.  We went to the 10:15 showing of Man of Steel... for the entire evening, you could hear the club music thumping against the side wall.  Huge distraction from the film and the experience.  I think I will opt for classic theaters in the future unless it's a midday thing and we aren't eating."}
{"text":"As you walk into Studio Movie Grill, it's difficult not to be amazed. These seats are pretty awesome. It's like seeing stadium seating for the first time when all you're used to are regular old movie seats. For those of you who don't remember, movies used to have these uncomfortable seats that were mostly on the same level. Go to the Manor if you want to see - almost everywhere has stadium seating now, and even the cheap places have a pretty good rise to the rows, with reasonably comfortable seating and soft, ambient light. Didn't used to be that way.  Anyway, these seats are rather incredible, with little swivel armrests where you can sit your food. They also have a cupholder underneath, which is odd, because if you have something in the cupholder, you can't swivel your tray - poor planning on that one. Each seat also has a button you can hit if you want to order something. Nice idea, because the \"turn and order\" option of Cinebarre doesn't always work that well. To be fair, the button doesn't work that well either, but it's a bit better, and at least you have a really comfortable seat.  The ordering process goes smoothly, and food comes out reasonably well - unless everyone orders at once. In that case, it can go slowly. So you may want to arrive early and get your order in. If you arrive just on time for the movie, like everyone else, it might be a bit of a delay.  As to the food: So-so. The menu advertises hand-made pizzas, but only some of them seem to be. Others are clearly frozen, or really, really taste like it, so someone is very adept at making pizza taste like frozen. The flatbreads appear to be handmade. Ribs have way too much sauce. The chicken strips are pretty decent.  Perhaps the coolest thing (other than the chairs) are the perks: You can actually order your tickets on-line and choose your seats. Unfortunately, this means an extra charge. But you are then guaranteed your seats. You can pick your seats as you arrive as well, but then you are subject to whatever is left - so it might be worth an extra charge for a popular movie. Also, they validate in the Epicentre parking garage, so that's a good bonus. Just remember to take your ticket with you!"}
{"text":"I went to take advantage of the free ticket deal to see the Immortals with friends - but when we arrived, the theater had suffered a burnt-out bulb and we were forced to see Twilight instead.  While that might be grounds for a negative star review and a human rights complaint, I opted to tolerate it for the sake of science. The theater is about what I've come to expect.  The service is good - you have a call button you can push and the waiter'll come running out to you - and they pretty much cater to your every whim while you relax and watch your movie.  However, the food is hilariously overpriced, which I did anticipate, so I can't say it was a shock to me.  But it's not getting any Michelin stars, let's put it that way. The major dealbreaker - the reason I give this place a bad review - is the seating.  Half is theater seating, which is maybe one step above your normal theater seating, and the other half were office chairs with desks in front of them.  Okay, sure, they're NICE office chairs, but the place just opened.  Wait three months and see how nice they are then. Why is this a dealbreaker if the chairs are sufficiently comfy and the service is respectable, and you knew what you were in for, you might ask me.  Well, here's the kicker.  There are other dinner theaters in this city, and while their tickets are generally more expensive, the general experience is much, much better.  So if you grade comparatively, SMG just loses out.   Now, if you're cheap, then just go for it - get there early, get good and soused at Four Peaks across the way first - but if you're looking for a novel, quality movie going experience... look elsewhere."}
{"text":"decent theater but very expensive. Got free tickets for the movies so I thought it would be a nice reasonable price out for my son and I. The seats were comfortable, the theater clean, but the waiters walking back and forth and taking orders was a little to distracting for me. And then my son and I each order a burger and soft drink and the bill was $30 really - and I was not impressed with the burger, overcooked and small so... while the movie theater was clean and seats were nice, not clean or nice enough for me to return"}
{"text":"I have been going to the N. Scottsdale location for some time. I have over $200 in movie cash for other theaters and I still end up here because the experience far surpasses that of other theaters. The food is great, and the selection is spot on. If you try one thing, try the chicken wings! Who knew a movie theater would make the best chicken wings I have ever had. I go here with my wife and we split a bucket of beers and some food....this is awesome as a date night. Love the concept."}
{"text":"This place is quite new and so a lot of things could still use a lot of improvement. We first tried this place as part of a Yelp event. The Yelp team did a great job in organizing everything, but the rest of the experience was mediocre at best.   At the event they had a lot of menu options to try, which was good, since that way we could try a lot of things instead of having to eat a plateful of the same stuff. The blue margaritas and the Redd's Apple Ale were good. The appetizers were okay on an average but the bbq chicken pizza / flat bread was really good, as were the shrimp, crabcakes and quiche. The ribs and coconut chicken was worse than average (my boyfriend loved the taste of the coconut chicken though, but I just thought it was too dry). Overall the hors d'eouvres event went well, with the alcohol and the appetizers flowing. I didn't get a chance to try the Cupcake wine because I wanted to stay awake for the movie but after reading the other reviews, I kinda wish I did.  It all started going downhill after that though. During the movie I ordered a black bean burger for the entree (we just ordered one between me and my boyfriend since we filled up on the appetizers) which took forever to arrive. It didn't feel that bad since we were distracted by the movie, but it must have taken at least half an hour for the food to get to us. After that, I was dismayed at how it was served. It came in a bowl, along with the sides (fries) and a smaller bowl of ketchup. I've never been served a burger in a bowl before. Needless to say, when I picked up what I thought was the whole burger, all that I could pick up was the top bun and the patty, partly because of how high the burger was. And I'm terribly sorry to say this but it completely failed in taste, lacked flavor and was really dry. I wish we could have ordered something more (the smoked bacon and gouda burger?) to see if they did better overall and just the black bean burger was what was wrong. Also, the servers seemed really unsure of themselves, but I guess that's because the place is new and they are still on the learning curve.  My boyfriend also noticed that the speaker system was off. The surround sound was fine, but the main front speaker where most of the voices came from was way distorted and quiet (those are his words, unfortunately I don't notice such things).  We decided to give them a second try when my boyfriend's parents were in town. The servers are just as confused about the entire layout as I remember. Something that was ordered by someone sitting in row J or K was first brought up to us (all the way back in row M) and when we said we didn't order it, they finally found the seat that ordered it. And this wasn't a one time thing, they kept bringing orders to the wrong seats and/or asking people if they received their orders or were still waiting for it. As it is, it was a distraction to have the servers walk around the place, and on top of that I don't want them bothering me when I haven't even ordered anything and am just trying to watch the movie.  I really hope they get a little more organized system in place to serve people or at least have their servers familiarize themselves with the layout. I also suspect the whole taking orders on iPod touch isn't quite working as well as they hoped it would, but oh well, what do I know?  Oh by the way, when you get your ticket validated, make sure it has the extra validation bar codes. My boyfriend gave the parking ticket to the lady at the box office to get it validated and she probably ran it through the machine, but it didn't actually print the validation bar codes. We didn't realize it till we handed the ticket to the lady at the ticket booth while exiting the parking and she asked for $10 saying the ticket wasn't validated. Very careless move, SMG."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. Parking is free if they stamp your ticket. I think it covers up to 3 hours. Food here is pretty good for what it is. It's better to plan ahead when picking seating so you can get a good spot. Chairs are comfortable. My only issue with this place is that sometimes it takes forever to get things. A non-alcoholic drink literally takes about 15 mins. Other than that, it's good!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give SMG 3.5 stars, so I'll round up.  The theater is nicer than your average movie theater, especially if you buy full price tickets and pay the extra $2 to reserve seats.  The problem is the disparity between the nice seats and the not nice seats.  The nice seats are comfortable arm chairs with side tables--they are great.  The not nice seats are office chairs lined up at countertops, resembling seats at a college seminar class.  I just thought these were odd.  Fortunately, I bought tickets through Groupon Now! ($5 for a ticket & soda), so having to sit in the office chairs was worth it.  I would have been angry if I'd paid full price for a ticket and got stuck there!  I think the Groupon Now! is probably best used for movies that have been out a few weeks so you still have a chance to get a bargain and sit in the nice seats. We only ordered popcorn, which wasn't particularly hot nor was it very buttery (although that's healthier, I suppose), so I can't really comment on the quality of the food.  I will say that the menu prices seemed pretty in line with the typical grill sit down restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I feel like I'm going on a date w/ my hubby every time. You get to eat and have a few drinking while ur watching ur movie. Best part is that you buzz for your server when you need a refill or anything else that you might need. I Love how they have couple seats. Food is yummy and that prices are pretty much the same as if your going to just have popcorn or nachos at a regular movie theater. So why not go here and just have an actual full meal and service!.  It's not as packed as going to a regular theater. idk why, but that's even better i guess. Everyone should go here. I think it's an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Can you please turn the A/C on in theater 4! It's unbearably hot in here. I want to enjoy my meal and the movie but dripping in sweat is not comfortable. I had high hopes but it would be more comfortable at home. Great idea but disappointed."}
{"text":"First time at this theater and my seat was a freaking office chair. Will not be returning. I have better seats at my house. Was ignored by the staff while they served people in the regular seats. Definitely  will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was here for my birthday celebration with friends and family. I watched the showing of the Black Panther. I have been here before to watch a movie.  An ongoing issue I have is with the service.  The service is not good. The servers tell you to turn off your call button and they will be right with you. However they never come back. That's is the whole purpose of keeping the call button on so they know you need service.  I asked for a cup of water. I never got it. I was told to turn my button off it was so dark in there.  I could not see which server was supposed to serve me. The good thing I like about attending here is they validate parking for 4 hrs to give you a chance to eat if you want to eat somewhere else beside inside the movie grill. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you just wanted the experience of watching a movie at the Epic Center."}
{"text":"The last time we were here, someone had vomited in the area that our seats were reserved. The area was wet from staff trying to clean it, but it was not the best cleaning job.  We complained about the smell, but they would not move us to another area even though there were some other seats available. We have had other great experiences at SMG, but this experience was bad all the way around--the food was cold, overpriced and had to eat due to the odor of vomit. The insides of each theatre have become rundown too. We haven't been back in awhile due to our last experience."}
{"text":"Great for movies but stay away from the food. Service isn't the greatest either, but they do validate parking which is nice."}
{"text":"Most of the staff are rude and the food is terrible and overpriced. I am also 98% sure the chicken tenders gave my date food poisoning."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to studio movie grill for the last 4+ years, and each time I ask myself why we go back. We went on Wednesday, May 2nd to go see the new avengers movie at 8 P.m. And we got there right before 8, sat down and ordered our food and drinks (water, Dr. Pepper, two salads and popcorn). 10 or so minutes later a man sits down in front of us and orders his food and drinks. As well as a couple sitting behind us about the same time. Well 10+ minutes pass and he gets his drink. Then his food. Then the couple gets their drinks, and their food. Then the couple behind us get refills of their drinks. We get annoyed and ask an attendant to see about our drinks and popcorn... She says the popcorn machine was having an issue and needed to reset, still no drinks. We push the button for the server and he comes. It is well past 30-45 minutes at this point and still no drinks at all. We stop another attendant, she apologizes and actively walks out of the theater to get our drinks. Then the girl we talked to 20+ minutes before finally comes back with our drinks, then the other girl comes back with our drinks. We take them since we figure it would take an act of God to get refills when we actually want them. We finally get our salads, and have drinks, miracles do happen. Then almost halfway through the movie we finally get our popcorn, and it is only a half full SMALL bag. No apologies for the long wait or explanation of the lack of a full bag, nothing. And this is by no means the first issue we have had here. I've pretty well decided if we want to go to a movie we need to only plan on seeing a movie there, because this affects my whole movie experience. I am sitting there wondering if I will ever get my food, or drinks. And having time address this with attendants. We do not suggest this theater to other people for this reason. I actually took pictures of the receipt because I was so annoyed by the experience. The only positives were that the food was good, the seating was comfortable and the movie was great... Pretty well everything made me wish we had driven out to one of the AMC or Regel."}
{"text":"So I have been coming to the theater for the past 4 years. Sure over those past year studio movie grill has had some... Bad service, or some movie issues... But never like I have experienced this time!   First of all I will say that every time I go to the studio movie grill I almost always regret it because people talk a lot, and the servers are usually in the way. I just personally like a darker quieter place.   This time the server right off the bat had a nasty attitude with me and my friend, kind of like she didn't want to even be at work. When we tried to order she would roll her eyes, and act like our order was to much. Yes it was a bigger order, but still, that is her job. They were out of almost every drink we wanted! I don't know how you run out of drinks on a Friday, but it happened.   So finally after about 30 mins into the movie, our drinks come out, water down of course.  Food comes out half way into the movie, of course cold. The server never came back so we had to call a new one to tel them that she forgot half of our order! Finally when the movie was 3/4 over we get all of our cold food!  After spending over $100 and having 3 servers total. I was so ready to get out of that place! Like I said, I know places can have bad days here and there, but enough was enough!   So the next day I called the theater to talk to a manager, was on hold for 20 mins when one of the host says they would leave my name and number for management to call me back because they have an event and can't get to me right now.  A week passes and no call so I call back again.... And guess what... Get the same answer....  So another week passes and finally they connect me to a manager!!!!  And all the manager says is... \"Sorry, we don't do movie passes anymore, so next time you need to let someone know while you are here so we can fix it. Other then that, that's all I can do.\"   What a terrible answer for someone that lives 6 mins away, and comes all the time and spends over $100!   So that will be the last time I go to SMG, at least until they get a entire new staff! (Besides the girl that takes the tickets with the big hair! She's always nice!)"}
{"text":"Love this place! It is right around the corner from us, so the location is very convenient. The staff is always very friendly. It makes for a great date night, as you can order food and drinks. I have only ordered food once, I believe a chicken salad, and thought it was good. I love that you can order a bucket of beer or wine while relaxing and watching a movie! I would recommend picking your seats online beforehand because the comfy seats are taken quickly. I noticed that on Fridays they offer 25% off bottles of wine, so I plan to go back and do dinner and wine night soon.  The best part is the Groupon offer. It is $5 for a ticket, and you can use the Groupon code to go on Studio Movie Grill's website to choose your seats. You can't beat a $5 movie these days! The staff is also very helpful with redeeming the Groupon at the front."}
{"text":"Damonte was a rude server. Wouldn't bring what was asked and combative when speaking to us. My date was highly offended. When I asked for hot sauce for chicken tenders he said \"we don't have that\" and stormed off. Pretty sure they have hot sauce there"}
{"text":"This was my second and LAST time to this movie theater.  There's a club/lounge attached to this theater which is a recipe for disaster.  They make people  wait in the club area before the movie starts which is extremely awkward.... Once I got in I noticed that the seats were extremely dirty,  stains everywhere! It was disgusting. I still decided to stay since I bought the tickets.  During the movie we could hear the bass thumping from the club.. Lastly,  on our way out we had to walk straight through a ghetto crowd to exit.  This is definitely not the ideal theater to go.  Trust me,  try another option."}
{"text":"Full service kitchen and bar, awesome leather seats AND $5 groupon tickets? This is the only place I go to the movies. The entire menu is solid. I love the popcorn, salads and pizza. The GF likes the coconut tenders."}
{"text":"I haven't been a movie-goer in years, but SMG could change my mind on that. It was a great way to kick back and watch a flick. Movie tickets are actually a little cheaper than a regular theater. Food and drink prices are about what one would expect to pay on a night out of dinner and drinking. The fun part is this includes a movie. Seating is comfy and very relaxing. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I think they are trying to turn this into a theater for everyone. It'll take sometime but could be worth the wait. Still a great theater to see movies Uptown. 3 stars right now but could easily move up very soon."}
{"text":"Watched Black Panther here, while the movie itself was awesome the rest of the experience was less than desirable. Ordered a frozen strawberry margarita pitcher with sugar, received regular strawberry margs with salt. Also ordered veggie burgers and fries, 20 minutes goes by, then 40, then 2 and a half hours. Food never came out. It was still on our bill at the end of the movie! We said we never received the food & they did NOT apologize, just said they'd change it. We walked out because they were taking too long with our bill and stopped by the register at the doors to pay. It was still on our bill!?? Then we waited another 20 minutes for them to correct their error and we finally paid for our drinks and left. Still no apologies or anything done to correct their error that left us without dinner."}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon and had a positive experience, from purchasing tickets online to choosing our seat assignment ($1.50/seat extra). I chose the seats with the tray tables as other reviews said that they were a little weird sitting in office chairs.  There was plenty of parking and no line when we went to redeem our Groupon tickets. We were shown to our seats by the helpful staff on hand and our waitress came to take our drink order right away. Ordered the margarita with Blue Curacao (can't remember the exact name) and my gf ordered the house margarita. Both were yummy. For dinner, I got the California Hamburger and she got (?). Both were delicious and delivered super quick.  I chose to pay for the meal when they were delivered as not to be interupted during the last 15-20 minutes of the movie. This worked out good.  The only negative thing I would say is that the theatre is a little run down, not as clean as could be and the carpets were a bit sticky and smelly.  Everyone there was super helpful and friendly and we might go back again. Just need to try IPic first."}
{"text":"The big lazy boy chairs are awesome but the other ones are like office chairs.  Other than that it's reasonably priced food, nothing special.  Drinks are good but pricey"}
{"text":"So the concept of this place is great!  In theory, it's like a modern day drive-in theater.  You have big spacious seats, and each seat has a tray, and waiters come and take your order, and they bring you food (not just popcorn and candy -- but pizza, hamburgers, fries -- and they even served alcohol if you want it).    But here is the down side to this place that the owners really need to work out.  1) The waiters circulate throughout the entire movie!  And to take orders they use iPhones.  So imagine ten people roaming the cinema the entire time with bright iPhones.  So it's hard to focus on the film when people are roaming the cinema for the ENTIRE TIME.    2) Then, if the person next to you wants to place a big order, then the waiter comes and yells over you to get that order.  That's seriously disruptive!    3) Then the manager comes to bring you the check towards the end of the movie.  And in 99% of the cases, the last 30 minutes of the movie are the most intense/exciting/dramatic.  Do you really want a manager asking you to check your order and give him your credit card while you're trying to enjoy the last critical scenes of the film.    Under normal circumstances, I think this place would only merit two stars -- three max.  Again, it's a great concept, but the owners need to work out the kinks to make it more enjoyable.   So why did I give this place one star only?    Well, on my first visit, the kitchen of this place catches on FIRE.  Yes, that's right.  The kitchen caught on fire!  Apparently, they couldn't handle all the orders that were being placed.  So if you're going to market yourself as a big theater that can feed people as they watch movies, you need to have a kitchen that works and is safe.    They had to evacuate the entire cinema.  Everyone was standing out in the cold for 30 minutes until they could get everything under control in the kitchen.  So after the fire, no food was available for the rest of the evening.  And since I was counting on this place serving me dinner, I hadn't eaten before hand.  So I had to sit through the entire long movie hungry and annoyed.    So I won't be going back to this place..."}
{"text":"Servers inside the movie theater. Seems like a great idea on paper... not so sure though in real life.   Pros:  -If you want to see the hot new movie on opening weekend, you can buy tickets ahead of time online... and even pick out your seats. Saves you all that hassle of going to a theater early and waiting. -SMG validates parking. This is HUGE because that Epicentre deck is ridiculous. The validation is good for up to four hours. -The seats are super comfy. It's like being on a couch. -The service was great. There was an army of servers manning our theater. Which leads me to the cons...  Cons: -There's an army of servers roaming around the theater. Talk about distraction dot com. -They keep a light on in the theater.  -It's not quiet. The booming bass from Kazba next door plus all the noise from people eating, ordering food, servers moving around... it's a lot. -Alcohol served in a theater. There will be at least one drunk person in your movie. In my case, it was the couple next to me... hammered. And all over each other. No, they were not teenagers... they were like 40.  There are certain times when it makes complete sense to come here. But if you're straight up just wanting to really enjoy a movie... I would recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is like a sad shell of what Mez used to be.  While Mez had it's problems before Studio Movie Grill took over (Paying higher price for regular seating, they called it \"Premium Seating\"), SMG added a host of other issues.  First I'll hit on some positives and as to why I didnt rate it as 1 star.  We bought the $5 Groupon, and ordering tickets online was a breeze, and picking your seats beforehand is a really good idea and I think that movie theaters should all implement some sort of seating arrangement so that you don't walk in to the theater with 5 people only to find that you have to split up or sit in the very front row.  The web experience is awesome.  Now...on to the concerns.....I thought at first that the idea of a movie/dinner hybrid would be a good idea.  I was wrong.  I went to this theater twice after buying the Groupon.  The first time, when I got to my seat, it was covered in a white powdery liquid, like someone had a baby and it upchucked on the seat or something.  We told one of the waiters just to see if we could get it cleaned or get a towel or something to sit on...and then they said they would be right back.  So I stood....and waited...and waited.....20 minutes went by before I grabbed another staff member and asked them to clean it.  After that I waited another 10 minutes before a staff member came by with what looked like a spray bottle and a paper towel and tried to spray it down.  No luck.  All the waiter said was \"Thats pretty gross, I wouldnt sit there either.  Sorry, theres not much I can do\".....NOT \"Let me see if I can find you another seat\" or \"We are sorry, have a free movie on us\"  or anything.  It was just \"suck it up and sit in the goo, or go home\".  My wife slid over in her seat and we pretty much shared one seat for the entire movie.  Upon leaving, we had our parking \"validated\"...meaning one of the staff members looked at the ticket, acted like she was doing something to it, and then handed it back.  When we left the parking garage, we found out that it WASNT validated, all the staff member had done was just write an X on it or poked a hole in it or something.  We had to pay an extra $10 for parking.  The second time we went was just as unpleasant.  This time we were able to get seats that were decent.  We got to our seats, and placed our order, which was just popcorn and a soda.  That was all we ordered.  About 10 minutes later, the guy next to me ordered a hamburger and a couple other things.  20 minutes later, once the movie started, the guy who ordered the hamburger received his meal.  We were still waiting.  It wasnt until 30 minutes into Iron Man 3 (1 hour later!)  and after checking with the staff on the status of the popcorn that we finally received it.  Well, then we bit into the popcorn, and it was the absolute saltiest thing I had ever tasted.  I love salty foods, I put salt on a lot of my food.  This was unbearably salty...like the kind where it almost stings your mouth.  I took two bites and tried to flip the popcorn over, because I thought that maybe the bottom half would be less salty.  Didn't work.  I dont normally send things back unless they are unbearably bad....I sent it back and asked for a lot less salt.  10 minutes later, we get the popcorn again, this time it had NO SALT at all.  We just ate it anyway.  On top of all that, my wife missed half the movie trying to fix our salt situation.  Having the waiters and waitress going up and down the stairs with their iPhone/ordering devices was also extremely distracting.  We had better experiences at Northlake or Concord Mills theaters.  We probably wont be going back to SMG.  Overall, Mez just seemed more upscale.  While the ticket prices were sometimes outrageous there, SMG seems like a cheap knockoff.  The atmosphere is very different then Mez.  Mez was more like an upscale club that had a nice theater attached.  SMG feels like a cheap movie theater that happens to have a restaurant, and they don't know quite yet how to make the two work together well.  We went to Mez several times just to eat at the restaurant.....After seeing the food at SMG and experiencing the service, I doubt we'd go just for the food."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but expensive. Only complaint is that I couldn't really see the screen in my spot (way in the back) because there was a large table in front of me with a few people sitting at it, blocking my view."}
{"text":"The milk shake alcohol is amazing. Remember to try that. Other food is ok. Maybe eating in the dark can make your tongue more sensitive. But it is definitely a good experience. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"the idea of having a full functioning restaurant and bar in a movie theater seems great right? As much as I would like to believe that, my experiences here have not been that great.  Beginning with the pros, I would like to list all the things that I LOVE about this theater.  -If your looking for a great location to watch a movie, then this is the place! It is in the heart of uptown at the epicenter, where you will not be disappointed with the entertainment. Trust me when I say my night doesn't end at the theater! I always find myself venturing out to a bar/club afterwards. -The theater is clean for the most part. SMG is not like most theaters where you will see popcorn everywhere. It is tidy and has an urban style to the design. Also, they just updated their seating, which is very comfortable. It's somewhere that would be great for a first date. -Parking is free! This is important as prices can be upwards of $40 dollars at the epicenter on a busy night. Just bring your parking slip to the front when you get your tickets, and they will validate it for up to four hours. -The service is at your finger tips. Yes, all you have to do is hit the red button and service is on its way! this is a nice feature because I always need extra sauce, extra napkins, and extra attention. I am what you would call a waiters worst nightmare...Just kidding!   Although having a button seems nice, this leads me to the cons..  -Your button can accidentally be pressed, which actually happens quite often. It is conveniently placed on the food table where food belongs, and for me..my elbows. I always seem to accidentally hit the button and get interrupted during the movie by the staff. As many times as I have been here, I seem to do it every time.  -The food is not great. This is disappointing because that is what all the hype is about. To be served while enjoying a movie. In my opinion, everything is over seasoned. There is healthy options, but those items are NOT healthy at all. Would a salad smothered in dressing and topped with two heaping handfuls of croutons be considered healthy? I think not! Aside from my healthy eating, the other food is just not very good. It is equivalent to bar food. I would only recommend it if you are in need of some dessert. With that being said I am living for their milkshakes! Want an alcoholic milkshake? Well, they can do it!  For me, it makes perfect since to come here whenever I want to catch a movie. However, I am just not in love with the food. You would think it would be much better, with all the competition from the surrounding restaurants. Unfortunately, this in not the case."}
{"text":"I've never checked in before but I have been to this theater multiple times.  The seats are comfortable and the theater is clean.  The service is great and the food is ok.  The only thing that needs attention is the theater during show times.  The past few movies I have been to with my family have been pg or pg-13 and every time there is some rude human that brings their 2-year old in pj's that talks the entire time!  I remember the days when staff would walk the aisles and make sure it was quiet..the wait staff should have the authority to do the same or tell management.  People that were around this last group all moved to our row.  We pay too much for the luxury experience to have to deal with managing someone else's kids.  Next time I'll ask for a manager.  The theater is worth the visit but speak up"}
{"text":"I came here, kicking and screaming, because everyone else wanted to watch Blade Runner.  Mark H. decided to help the situation by buying a pitcher of margaritas (A reason to come here--they sell alcohol.)   It is wise to buy tickets online at least a couple of hours before the showing to pick a type of seat. I ended up with a comfortable office style chair that swiveled and rolled, which was probably too much fun. I noticed the people behind me had more of typical dine-in chair. They were missing out. Plus my set-up had a counter-style bar that ran the length of my row. This is great if you like what someone else is eating. You can just reach over and help yourself. I did. This counter is also great if the movie is bad, you can just put your head down and take a nap. I didn't. That is not to say that I'd recommend Blade Runner, but it did keep my attention enough not to nap.  The theater was clean and so were the bathrooms.   I would come here again."}
{"text":"SMG changes my movie expectations dramatically...I LOVE being able to watch EVERY Disney/Pixar movie that comes out with wine or a cocktail! But the biggest SURPRISE is that the food at SMG is actually really, really good!   There's a great variety and the prices are very fair. Everyone has been pleased with the food. I loved the Asian Chicken Salad!  I'd much rather spend $8 for a good, fresh kids meal- quesadilla, pizza, burger or chicken tenders/fries- than on a cup of popcorn, gummies and a drink at AMC.  On Sundays the house wine- not too bad- is $5."}
{"text":"Why all the bad reviews?! I came here on Veterans Day with 3 kids and a senior. We were able to use a Groupon. If you compare this theater to ipic there are some similarities. You can reserve your own seats, there's a little table to eat and there are leather seats. These do not recline but do lean back and were very comfortable. It's a smaller theater and the food was reasonably priced.  Sound was great and so was the service. It's not as flashy as ipic but certainly a cool change from a regular movie theater."}
{"text":"The waiters here are terribly slow. You get free soda refills but even sitting through a 3 hour movie the most refills you'll get will be two. Last Friday night they didn't even bother to bring a last refill for my wife and she ordered it with 50 minutes left to go in the movie.   The groupon deal is hard to beat though and the food is good. If you need more than one soda you better order the refill early. They're also very stingy with sides of ketchup and ranch. Only once of the 10 times I've been have they actually given me an extra cup of either and I've asked for it each time.   I'll continue to go if I have a groupon. Otherwise, the terrible waiters wouldn't be worth full price. I'd just go to any bar for similar food before hitting up another theatre.   The one major plus is they serve Pepsi products so I can get Mt Dew. The bad thing is it takes at least 45 minutes to get a refill. As I said, I've been here a lot as the groupon comes out all the time. Not once have I ever gotten a refill within 30 minutes of asking for it.  That's a long time to go thirsty."}
{"text":"i went to SMG once and the movie i was attending got canceled about 30 min after the start time while everyone had waited in the theatre (projector was broken and they couldnt fix it). They gave us 2 free movie passes each, they comped our food and drinks for the movie and gave us another free movie of our choosing that night. All of this was done without our asking or making any fuss. It was a bad situation having to cancel a movie and it was handled wonderfully by the entire theatre servers, management, and even the box office ticket sellers. Amazing customer service!  Also great movie theatre when movies actually get shown, lol. great atmosphere, quick service, good drinks (average food, if im honest)"}
{"text":"My sister passed along a free movie pass so the hubby and I went yesterday. This place is really nice! I'm not much of a drinker, but the bar was impressive.   We were the first of 6 people to arrive for the afternoon showing of The Immortals. The movie was nothing to write home about, however the theater is. The seats are roomy and comfy with a tray for food that slides back & forth. It would have been nice if the seats reclined more. I ordered the popcorn which was buttery, salty and yummmmmy:)   I took 1 star away because the volume was crazy-loud. I anticipate the volume being loud which is why I always bring earphones to the movie. It was still so loud that I couldn't hear the sarcastic comments I was making in my head about Micky Rouke."}
{"text":"What better way to see a movie than by having dinner and a drink as well? See as I live around the corner from this spot, my girlfriend and I make this our cinema of choice. The movies are around the same price as AMC and Harkins as well! The reason for the 4 stars is because the food is decent, but the margarita I had was sugar mixed with a little more sugar. I'll definitely keep going here, just might stick with beer instead."}
{"text":"The whole concept of going in and being treated like you're being served at a restaurant with a waiter, but you're in a \"normal\" movie theater but with a table that pulls up to you, was brand new to me and I loved it. Been here three times. Food is delicious, especially the fries, both the \"plain\" fries (which are spicy) and the sweet potato fries (which are really sweet potatoes and not just flavored). The screens are huge, too, with standard, strong sound, and the 3D theater uses RealD.  I do have a complaint and that is that their server request lights are not being kept up to proper maintenance. Mine was out once, and the theater is still relatively new, so I found that to be a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"Love this place! Get row F if you can!  Okay, so you can get groupons all the time for like $6 which includes a non alcoholic beverage!  That's a deal!  Even if not, go on Ladies night or late at night and it's still a deal!  The cool thing is that they have these little \"love nest\" type chairs where if you go you can cuddle.  Downside is if you're alone and sit there you might be closer to a stranger than you wanna be!  You get a little slide table in front of you if you're in certain rows.  Then other rows are made up of a counter with office chairs.  You decide where you want to sit (assigned) so that it's kinda nice and forces me to go ahead of time to get row F in the middle!  Once seated you can look at your menu (Oh, yes, they have a full menu!) and then when ready you press your little button and BAM!  Waiter comes to you.  Their Iced Tea is very good and I can even get a gluten Free pizza for just a bit more than a normal restaurant would charge.  NOTE:  If you're in a packed movie, I'd forgo food.  Takes forever to get your food and LONGER for the drink.  Don't know why but you were warned!  I usually go after a movie's been out a while and during the week to avoid the crowds.    Did I mention there's a full bar in the lobby?  YUP.  Really, why would you go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"Food is average but service is good and price is great. $5 deal for movie with comfy seats where we can order dinner and drinks. Perfect for a family date night!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this place all the time and was always so happy leaving. Not sure what happened. Our night was ruined and we went this particular location for the fun and experience.  First of all, our Movie started at 5pm on a Sunday. We weren't let into the theater until 5:01pm.  Second, the seats weren't the same anymore. They are crammed in and do not recline anymore more!! That is the whole point of going, and that is the new trend! Why would you take that feature out??? Third, we ordered popcorn with no butter, and the popcorn arrived with what seemed like all the butter they had on our basket.  It also was extremely salty. Fourth, our server was lazy, messy and kept yawning when she was taking out order.  We also noticed that all the other servers were messy and seemed like they just rolled out of bed. Fifth, my cousin ordered a burger with mayo, server said it came on the side already. Mayo was never on the side so he ate a dry, tasteless burger.  Going to the movies in Uptown, we were already expecting to pay a lot of money, for parking, movie, snacks. Its part of the great experience and we were up for it. However, after all that!! I will NEVER return.  What a waste of money! NEVER AGAIN!!   Do yourself a favorite and check out the theater at Pineville, seats are 100% more comfortable and the people there are super nice and do their job with pride!"}
{"text":"I was attending a movie screening, having always intended to visit studio grill. The environment is welcoming, as is the staff. The menu was perfect for the setting. I had the loaded potatoe skins, a BBQ bacon burger and a Long Island ice tea ( on special).  To begin, the potatoe skins were delicious. Way better than I had expected , and service was quick. The burger was delicious and perfectly cooked. I love popcorn, but this was the perfect substitute.  Price wise, this is on par with food you'd get at a bar with restaurant. The staff, I think really makes the ensemble and I'm willing to pay that price for the level of service they provide. Other theaters offering similar do not match the service and freshness of he food at studio grill.   The only dings I have are as follows: The front looks new and modern, but the theater (I was in at least) seemed behind the times. The chairs were a touch older than expected and I found a few discarded items behind the swivel seat. Not too terrible, but that theater at least wasn't in keeping with the overall theaters general presentation.   Key take always are: good service, quality staff, and and even better quality food.   I would most certainly return."}
{"text":"Most pleasant movie experience ever.  There is a nice bar and lobby seating area where you can wait for your theater to begin seating.  The chairs are very comfortable and spaced apart appropriately.  We usually have a drink and dessert during the movie and have never had anything negative to say about the staff or the menu items.  The restrooms are always clean and stocked.  There is an escalator inside to go up to the theaters or you can use the elevator outside."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced even on Tuesdays when it's suppose be cheaper. They no longer offer free refills on drinks, but they are still priced at $4 each. Brought the wrong food out at first. Food wasn't that great. Burgers were dry. Only thing they have going for them is tickets are $5 on Tuesdays and they are clean. Oh they do validate parking as well. A good thing the movie was awesome or I'd be really upset at spending close to $100 for 4 people."}
{"text":"So to start out with, I'm like, incredibly lazy. I mean it's ridiculous. So the idea of a movie theater where I could sit there and press a button and have all my food and drink served to me was such an awesome concept I knew it would go really well with Jurassic Park 3D. PS: Those dinosaurs still look so awesome.   We get there and the front desk girl was really nice and when we got upstairs they gave us a menu and we went to our chairs. I noticed a couple of things here: The cup holder is awkwardly placed. I want it next to my face so I don't have to reach over in the darkness to put my cup away and hope to god I don't drop it. The tables weren't so great if you had to use the bathroom during the movie. Which I totally did so I experienced that level of awkwardness myself.   The food is okay, my friends salad was a weird combination of salads and my coconut chicken tenders were pretty solid. The service was so weird though. Like, I wasn't sure if all the people were brand new or what. They came to take our order a couple of times before they realized someone else had taken it. My coke refill took for freaking ever. Seriously. We got our check halfway through the movie so that was a genius moment on our part since everyone else had to hang out during the credits to pay.   So by all means go and enjoy, but enjoy it a little less than if you had just gone to a restaurant and a cheaper movie theater. You could probably even just sneak in some vodka and it would still be cheaper.  Oh and they validate parking but if theres a dude standing there asking you to fork over 10 dollars to park then they don't validate. I told him I would just parallel park and I parked for like 4 hours for free so if theres a lesson anywhere it's to parallel park people. The spaces here are ridiculous huge. It's not even that hard."}
{"text":"Great theater. Matinee tickets were only $7.50. I love that we got to pick our seats and not get there early. Food and service were amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"this location is much nicer than the chicago one i have previously been to.  It's much more posh and lounge-like.  The ticket purchase went smooth and the worker was very friendly.    We had to wait in line for the theatre to be ready for a loooong time and were allowed in right in time for the previews to start.  The pizza is the only menu item I find worth it's price and I didn't like that they turned off the pop machines halfway through our movie because it was 11:00 PM.  They should wait til all showings to turn down the machine.  (I understand the kitchen closing, though.)  I will definitely see a movie here again.  Especially on Tuesdays.  Half off Ladies Night!!!"}
{"text":"This place is very modern and cool looking. I didn't know what to expect for the first time. I've never been to a theatre like this. AS you would in, you will notice the sports bar right behind the self check in kiosk.It wasn't packed and teh seating was comfortable. My lady and I decided  to have the coconut chicken and shrimp and a Daiquiri as well  This place is perfect for a date night .You can socialize and see the movie was well. I wish they had this when I was younger  Overall I really like this place and  I would definitely go back there to see more movies."}
{"text":"Do not go here.   We had a terrible experience.   They have a horrible policy on children.   They would not allow us to take a 6 month old into our movie.   The kid was sleeping.  The General Manager Thomas Farrell agreed that this is a horrible policy.   To top it off,  they wouldn't refund the service fee they charged when we purchased the tickets.  All parents,  please join me in contacting Area Manager Michael McCreary, at MMcCreary@studiomoviegrill.com.  Tell him that their ban on children is inappropriate. This company should be boycotted until they become family friendly.   Help me remind them that you can't always get a baby sitter and that parents deserve to see movies too."}
{"text":"Great place to go, relax and enjoy a movie and dinner. While not as plush as the Ipic the price is less as well. Comfortable seating with your choice of a desk chair type seat at a connected long countertop or individual seats with small flip tables. Service and food can be inconsistent, I've had them \"lose\" or forget my order and bring everyone's meal but one person in our group. But for the price it isn't bad."}
{"text":"Is it just me or do all of the employees seem miserable here? Maybe It was just the Sunday crew? There were too many bad experiences to list...I can recommend seeing IT, but will never return to this place."}
{"text":"One of the coolest movie theaters I have ever been to! Service is great, food is great, and prices aren't bad. I had chicken fingers and they were awesome! Make sure you bring a jacket it can be a little chilly!"}
{"text":"If it wasnt for the overly loud sound volume, this review would be 5 stars.  The seating is nice. The 4 hours validated parking is a $12 buck savior. The food quality and prices are excellent. $4 soft drinks in a BIG glass that they will refill for FREE!!!  Tell me one other movie theater who does that?? oh AND they serve it to you at your seat to boot.  Very fair portion sizes on all the food - and normal diner prices too. For the same money I would have to spend to get a small (nonrefillable) drink and small popcorn - I got a nice sized plate of grilled chicken, vegis and rice. and my big drink of soda. I'm a fan of SMG now........."}
{"text":"It's a great concept,  however there are many issues with service. First I'll state the pros, comfortable seating, parking validation, food was pretty good. Cons....the service.  We were seated at 10:15 for a 10:30 showing,  our order was taken immediately. We did the choose two which comes with an appetizer. You would expect the drinks appetizer to come first, right? Well...no. Our food actually came quickly, but it was our main course. The drinks didn't come, nor did the appetizer. In fact, I ate my entire meal before my drink came. Forget about asking for your drink, that little service light means nothing. The waitress looked me in my face and walked out of the theater and never came back. The drink and appetizer finally came at 10:45. I have no complaints about the movie/seating. Oh, they did try to bill me twice, so watch out for that.  The waitress took my card at the beginning. Then at the end a waiter came for my card. I wouldn't give it to him again, he finally used his light and figured out that he was at the wrong seat."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing!  I absolutely love the food and atmosphere.  I was sold on this place a long time ago, but today I was astonished by the customer service.  I had an issue yesterday and today it was taken care of by Adam, the manager, and the outcome far exceeded my expectations.  They went above and beyond.  I will always be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the bad reviews. My friends and I love this place. We probably go at least a couple times a month and it's always been a fun experience.   Groupon ALWAYS has deals ($5 for ticket and drink), so you're pretty much getting the movie for free... which makes the food prices very reasonable, considering what you'd pay to get dinner elsewhere and then go pay full price at another theater.   The movies are always new releases with a good amount of showtimes. The food is good- I've never gone with anyone who has said anything otherwise. There's a huge selection, including healthier options (Black Bean Burger & BBQ Chicken Wrap are yummy!). Honestly, I prefer the food here to a lot of comparable chain restaurants.  The service is great. They take your drink and food orders right away and don't come back until they bring the check at the end - unless you hit your little red button. Even then, they try very hard to be quick and quiet.   Overall, a great place if you put your expectations into perspective."}
{"text":"SMG is an awesome place to watch a movie, old sport.  I wouldn't go to enjoy the food though.  It's like a 3.5 but gave it a little more, why not.  Came here on a weekend to catch the Great Gatsby, which was a pretty good movie. It brought back memories of high school and well, ya know, reading the Cliff Notes right before the quiz.  (Do they even have Cliff Notes these days or do high schoolers just \"wiki\" everything--I probably would!)  The best part is that I thought it was pretty good price at $13.50 a ticket or something and the seats were super comfortable--I fell asleep for a bit!    The food was not good.  Everything was cold except for the pizza that we ordered.  I'm guessing it was because the pizza that everything else got cold while they waited for it to bake.  It got baked, but the rest of our food was beyond lukewarm.    \"It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.\" - Nick Carraway.  Think on that for a minute, old sport.  I'll definitely come back here to watch movies--the seats are comfy-womfy.  dmo out."}
{"text":"Love this place! You can watch a movie, sip a cocktail, and order all different types of food with a excellent wait staff! They always have good customer service, and immediately respond to the red bell! Groupons are plentiful as well, but they discontinued the free beverage which was nice while it lasted!"}
{"text":"The concept is really nice. We have been in a theater quite a few times. Seats are comfortable. Food is decent but service is terrible and getting worse compared to when they just opened. They usually screw up an order. Tonight, all we ordered were soda & popcorn - took them 30 minutes to bring popcorn to us, my husband had to ask twice about it & then finally the third server brought it. One of the problems is the person that takes your order never comes back to check up on your order - nobody cares. They show up to give you the bill. I ordered the coffee & it was completely horrific, disgustingly bitter &  impossible to drink. On the menu it says they serve gevalia coffee. We used to order it @ home years ago - it was never disgusting. So whoever makes it in the theater needs to learn how to brew coffee. Its better to eat elsewhere and just watch the movie at the theater. They do have a great deal on groupon - $5 for a movie & a drink - can't beat that! That's the only reason they get 3 stars. Their meal service deserves at the most 1 star."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Tonight was my 8th, and final visit. I loved the idea, concept and of course the groupon deal is great.  My issue, is the box office staff are the only employees with any sort of hint they care about being there. The servers, even manager, all act like they would rather be doing anything but assisting you. The lack of customer service is eye-opening. Especially in Scottsdale. This was my \"third and final\" attempt. My last 2 visits were equally as bad just in different ways. All three, food was cold, or undercooked, servers short and rude with you and rarely listen to requests. As for the desert? \"We have a contract and can't alter or change anything\" really guys? C'mon. Half the seats in the theaters, broken. Touch screens at entrance, broken, bathrooms, dirty. My first few visits to this place were amazing. I found an awesome budget alternative to they VERY good iPic. I fear no longer is this a place I will recommend or visit again. Management might be the key here, and honestly with how slow they are getting I'm not surprised if they shut their doors soon. I wanted this place to be awesome and hopefully someone does something to change it soon because tonight was horrible."}
{"text":"How great was this place? A bar in the lobby/lounge while you wait for you movie! A dining menu once you get seated inside the movie theater. BTW, for those that don't know, you can block your desired seat online, just like when getting your desired seat on an airplane. You even have at your seat a silent buzzer to alert an attendant to come and assist with your dining needs during the movie. The only thing that was a little bit distracting was the wait staff when they did come thru during the movie. But, that's the price you pay for having a dining service. The one other thing I'll mention is that its not crowded and noisy like a traditional movie house. Sweet!"}
{"text":"My sister was in Charlotte for the first time.  She wanted to see a movie and we also needed to grab some dinner prior so I took her to the Studio Grill at the Epicenter.  Upon arrival everyone from the ticket counter to the host was extremely nice and courteous.  The seats were very nice and comfortable. It seemed there wasn't a bad seat in the house..  I ordered a custom pizza.and it was DELICIOUS.  The crust was yummy, not to thick or thin.  My food was hot and I loved the button on my the tray to call over assistance.  I have been to one other place similar in VA and they did not have this wonderful feature.  Overall this was a great experience combining 3 of my favorite things, Food, Movies and great service.  I will be back and telling others."}
{"text":"Like the concept. Especially since when you go to a regular theatre you end up paying a ton of money for cruddy concessions. I have bought the Groupons for it several times. Totally worth it. The staff is very good and it is a nice touch being offered a mint on your way out. 1 tip: Don't order the dragon fruit mojito. Gross. I thought a mojito had more than just 1 mint leaf floating at the top...?!? I blame it on inexperienced drink makers. I will just go to the bar afterwards."}
{"text":"This is the last time that I will come here. Waited to see a manger to settle an issue they never came . The bar and lounge area serves as a night club!! The music is loud and whack and there are kids in the bar area!! This place is a complete disaster! Never again!"}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is an expected experience. We arrived after we purchased tickets on-line and the ticket taker was slightly rude. Her few words to us did not include a hello or may I help you or even a thank you for coming in. We found our seats and nestled in. Shortly after pressing our service button Sean arrived and was extremely pleasant. Our cheese fries came out quickly, hot and with the industrial can cheese sauce. For the $10 they are a pass. The seats were comfortable and the sound quality was excellent. Overall, Studio Movie Grill was an above average experience and is cheap and expected."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst theater experience ever. The website does not inform you you'll be sitting in what is basically an office chair from Costco. Completely inappropriate for a child. When I questioned this with a \"manager\" Jason I was greeted with sarcasm and disinterest. Too many other great choices for theaters in our area to settle for this type of nonsense. Go somewhere else. At least the wait staff is super helpful. Obviously not taking their lead from the so called management."}
{"text":"Great theater. Reasonable prices. LOST MY FITBIT ONE (black) HERE 2/6 theater 2 seat E10 & E9 5:45pm movie.  My FitBit One's last sync to my phone was just before the movie. I didn't notice it was off my back brace until the next afternoon, Tuesday,  after I attended another movie at 2:45pm theater 5 seat E8. I went back immediately and the lady manager was uncooperative and refused to check the lost in found. The next day a male manager was on duty and he did check the managers office. If you find it turn it into the manager. They have my name and number. Thanks"}
{"text":"Service and food are awesome!!!!!  Wish seats reclined.  Love the location and that it is never over packed."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times after my last review and the experiences were great! I finally got a chance to try the food and the burger was amazing! I also tried my friends pizza and it was also very good. The service was fast and the staff was very kind and helpful. We just had to push the red button and someone came right away. I love it! Definitely recommend a try! Just don't drink too much lol!"}
{"text":"SMG is my top pick when I'm hungry and want to catch a good movie. They are cheap and have a good menu. Drinks are priced decently as well.   Staff is always friendly and willing to help, as well as prompt to deliver food and drinks.   My only stitch with this SMG is how the facility is treated. It doesn't look like management has much of a willingness to keep this place updated. Seats are cheap office chairs that I'm always a little scared to get too comfortable on but it's better to sit at these since they have a bar and the other seating just has a little side tray that's too small.  Bathrooms look like they are cleaned once a day and not kept throughout the day."}
{"text":"Great theater in the heart of Charlotte. The seats are comfortable, staff friendly and food is good. The two for $25 deal is an excellent option, which is what we did - pretzel bite appetizer with a blackened chicken salad and a pizza. While the pizza left a lot to be desired and the pretzel bites were over-cooked and hard, the salad was fantastic. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the salad was fresh and hearty. Overall great experience, if the food was better I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"BEWARE IF BUYING DISCOUNT VOUCHERS ONLINE!!!    I bought a voucher for this on line.  I have done this several times in the past.  They now have added a hidden fee.  Before when you purchased the voucher you just had to show it when you went to get your tickets, now after you purchase your voucher you then have to go to another website and order them online.  This website charges a $1.50 \"seat service fee\".  I won't be buying any more vouchers on line.  Every time I went the service wasn't very good either."}
{"text":"This was me and my husband's first experience at this type of movie theater. We were highly disappointed. When we chose our seats (when purchasing our tickets) we chose seats that were centered in the theater, when we walked in the seats were in the corner. We let it go and didn't make a fuss...it wasn't the end of the world. However, when it was time for us order, we were \"greeted\" by a disgruntled female worked. She also messed up our order. When asked to fix it she just grabbed it, came back 15min with the fixed order and tossed it on our tray w/o saying anything. She never told us our total--she just said \"cash or credit\" and stuck out her hand. This was the worst \"movie experience\" ever!"}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill took the last standard slope cinema complex built in America (when the AMC Grand had introduced stadium seating) and turned it into a true winner. The staff is always buzzing around and the food is actually decent for a cinema! Get the seats with swing arm trays."}
{"text":"Fourth or fifth time here. Always dig this place. There's a bar in the front to just grab drinks before the movie , but once you take a seat in the theaters, they are quick to serve you, too. The food is pretty decent. Last time I had chicken tenders and shrimp. Pretty standard. Tasty. Today I had the ceviche and I was impressed! For $11 you get a good portion of seafood on a nice sized fresh leaf of lettuce. I would definitely order it again. It was tastier than ceviche at seafood or Mexican restaurants. Don't be too dissuaded by eating raw fish at the theaters...  I also like how you can choose your seat beforehand, so better to buy tickets early!  I do not recommend the counters.  I haven't sat there but people are just sitting in computer chairs. Looks less comfy..."}
{"text":"We were visiting the Charlotte area for my wife and my's anniversary. We had done some research on things to do and SMG was one on the list. The environment was very cool and the service was great! We had an outstanding server named Tim, we were bummed to find out that he had to pool his tips with the other servers, because we would have like to see him walk away with our tip!   It is a very fun experience. However, I will say this, if you are one who doesn't like interruptions during your movie, then do not go here. The staff does do a great job trying to stay inconspicuous, but there are still people coming and going in the theater.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"I got a Groupon to visit this place. $6 instead of $10. Went in on a Thursday night to see Beauty and the Beast. Our ticket exchange was easy and friendly. Entering towards the theaters, there was a lady checking tickets and handing out menus. We arrived later than most for a new release so we were stuck sitting in the 2nd row. Looking through the menu, a lot of the food looked quite good. Unfortunately, we had already eaten. We did get popcorn - hard to mess that one up. It was good, fyi.   Interesting experience for sure. The seats were not very comfortable, but they were clean. I did not like the lights at the bars, but I understand why they are necessary. You can order food at anytime throughout the movie. That was a big distracting but not terrible. One major con was the volume of the audio. It was SO loud. I literally had to plug my ears at some parts of the movie cause it physically hurt - no joke. The old ladies next to me were doing the same, so I wasn't the only sensitive one.   I'd love to come back again to dine and watch a movie. They have specials every day and a brunch! I'd recommend it to a friend for sure - just arrive early enough to get a seat away from the screen in hopes of not hurting your ear drums."}
{"text":"I am giving SMG two stars and that is simply the average rating as I have experienced okay times and terrible times.  My most recent trip will be my last.  My fiancé and I rarely visit uptown.  It's just not our scene.  However, we had a Sunday to ourselves and decided to day drink at the epicenter.  I desperately wanted to see Age of Adeline.  I have a girl crush on Blake Lively, but who doesn't?  The staff is friendly, we find our seats and push the button for service.  We decided to order the \"endless\" pizza special they have on Sundays... Maybe it's endless because there is not a beginning.   We sat there for 40 minutes without pizza.  So I finally pushed the button for service and asked where our pizza was.  Conveniently, It came out immediately, so I asked them to get started on the next one.  The pizza was simply awful.  But I ate it, because we were day drinking and needed something.  and I ate the next one, to make a point.  They steered clear of us after bringing us the second pizza, probably so they didn't have to bring us another pizza.    They did however slip the bill to us about halfway through the movie.  Well, I guess I am done ordering?  Do I really need to dig in my purse and miss some of the movie to get you payment so soon?  They grabbed our bill 4 times with no payment in it, because we were watching a movie... finally we submitted the payment because them pestering us for it was even more distracting.  There is only one way out guys... we are going to pay.  chill.    There are plenty of other theaters that do this better... a lot better."}
{"text":"I used to think that this was a wonderful concept.. But after the last three trips, I dont think I will be back to SMG or any other dine in theater.  The food here isnt bad.. but it never comes out hot.  I ordered a drink from the bar and that never came at all.  After pressing my button to get a better meal, then pressing it again to find out where my drink was, and a third time to get my bill straightened out becuase they didnt take the first meal off.. Uhg, I dont think I saw any of the movie.  The worst part was they delivered the damn check right at the most important climactic moment of the movie!  I could have just winced at that and moved on, but..  the three ladies in the seats next to me actually got out their flashlights to view their bill and battle over who bought what and what to tip for the remainder of the movie.. SO IRRITATING... back to dinner first, movie second."}
{"text":"awful, popcorn is the worst.  Cannot enjoy movie at all because people are   ordering during the movie and waiters are making noise constantly going back and forth and  up and down.   The smell of the food and hearing people eating and drinking, placing  orders is annoying."}
{"text":"I enjoy the convenience of being able to order food while waiting for the movie to start, however, the food is a little bit pricey for the quality of taste.   One thing that annoyed me that we ordered Popcorn and the waiters didn't think to bring out some napkin with the popcorn. Popcorn is a pretty butter and messy food. Once the movie started, I didn't want to press the service button so just spent the rest of the movie with oily popcorn hands.   The sound quality of the movie is also a bit off. At one point the beginning of the movie was extremely loud. The place looks amazing when you walk in but they could definitely overhaul their theaters."}
{"text":"Been there several times. Comfortable way to watch a movie. Small theaters. Table service and despite what some other reviewers have said I found the seats comfortable enough. Appetizers are subpar but if you want a beer or other beverage and a sandwich while you're there it's fine. It's funny to read that people think that it's expensive. I guess they forgot what a large popcorn and a couple of large diet cokes cost at the competitors."}
{"text":"Nice seats and layout but I could not get over how the staff managed to serve the food to myself and others and key points during a very suspenseful movie. In addition they brought the bill and expected me to pull out my credit card during the movies climax. It was incredibly distracting and poorly executed. SMG needs some tips from Cinebarre, who delivers the food seamlessly.   This theater would be my last choice among others in the area."}
{"text":"First of all....this is the best concept ever! A one stop - shop (so to speak) for your classic date night of dinner and a movie.  Love the fact that you choose your seats prior or reserve them days in advance online. Even better is the fact you are able to choose between the \"counter\" seats or what my husband and I call \"desk\" chairs, though they rather are quite comfy.  A push of a button and service is brought to you with a fairly good selection of menu items. My husband swears by their chicken tenders, where I opt for their quesadillas. Of the four times we've been here, the food was excellent out of three. The fourth was during a weekday and a slow night (which may have been a variable in why the food wasn't it's usual caliber).   The 5 stars rating, however, goes to their customer service. Kenny, the manager, went above and beyond to rectify a situation where we were out a movie and unable to be notified of the cancellation. Thank you, Kenny! Servers are really good and prompt.  Only theatre we go to, and for very good reason!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 6 for dinner, drinks, and a movie.  The food is just beyond terrible.  My mother's salad was inedible and my father's pizza had to be sent back because it came out completely raw.  My wings came out cold, and my wife's cheese fries were cold and soggy.  Whoever is in charge of this kitchen should be embarrassed.  I've had dinner here before, which set my expectations pretty low, but this past experience was just awful.  I'm not expecting a five star restaurant here, but in terms of \"bar food\" this is some of the worst I've ever had--and how do you mess up bar food?  SMG is a great concept, but execution is just poor."}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is a great concept. Dinner and a movie at the same time! Went here recently for date night. Saw San Andreas, which was a decent movie. However, you wouldn't be doing yourself a disservice by waiting for it to come out on Redox.  The positive is that the staff here is classy. There were three situations that occurred while I was there that were handled in a positive way. The first is that I was late and my date was already in the theatre with my ticket. I walked up to the lady who was taking tickets and told her that he had my ticket and I was going to wait on him to come out. She said \"okay, that's fine\" and that was it. When he came out, she saw him and we walked in. She never asked for the ticket. Perhaps she remembered him coming in alone. Who knows. Regardless, I appreciated not being hassled.   The next situation, my date's credit card was rejected. That could be embarrassing huh? Instead of making a scene, the attendant apologized (not that it was his fault) for the inconvenience and told him to not worry, finish watching the movie, and pay after the movie was over in the lobby. Classy! Not sure what the issue was, but he handled it.  Last issue was dealt with parking. While my date was paying for the food, I went to the bar to get my parking validated. The cashier required that I have my movie ticket present. She wasn't asking for too much, except for the fact my date had the movie ticket, not me -_-  Once he came over, it was validated in a jiffy. She was really nice about enforcing the rule without being a jerk.  While in the movies, I had the crispy chicken tenders with BBQ sauce and french fries. They were average. However, they were only $10. Considering a small popcorn and a soda are going to run you $8 at most movie theaters, real food being decently priced here is a huge positive. Studio Movie Grill is a great choice for dates. Parking validation makes coming to the Epicenter on a busy night more tolerable."}
{"text":"OFFICE CHAIRS IN A THEATER????? What were they thinking. For a minute I thought we were being punked. Why would anyone pay for CHEAP seating like this is beyond me. The Studio Grill in Simi Valley blows this one away, the office chairs concept would  not work in California. Thank goodness what we order to eat was decent.  Definitely will not patronize this business until they realize they are not a conference center.  Next time we're back in Scottsdale it will be iPic Theater for sure."}
{"text":"I agree with the other posts about the office chairs- a really, really bad idea! Fortunately, I was able to pick the larger chairs with side tables during both of my recent visits.   Pros:  - Cute lobby/bar area atmosphere - Can get a full bar and food menu as you       watch a movie - they run frequent specials/girls night out events (so much fun!) - the bar offers different drink specials, depending on the day - good sound system and smaller theaters - got to pick our seats when we purchased our tickets (that way we could take our time getting to our seats)  Cons:  - the option for rolling office chairs!! (What?!) don't do it!  - delivery of food and drinks can be a little distracting (but that's part of the fun,  - chairs don't recline (at all)  Overall I think it's a fun place to go to the movies. I will definitely be back- but only in those regular chairs!"}
{"text":"This movie theater is awesome, of course because you can eat, drink, and watch a movie at the same time!   I ordered a burger once and it came out cold, same as the fries.  But I decided to give the food another try.  The best thing I discovered on their menu is the chicken nachos appetizer. So now my fiancé & I get two orders of those with two blue moons and we are all set!  Service is a little slow as well and I have seen them get some orders incorrect, but for the most part it is ok and we will keep coming here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were pumped to go see Oz, and we decided 3D was the way to go. We got to the Studio Movie Grill and were surprisingly shocked when we found out Tuesday nights are Ladies night, and our tickets were half off, plus the $3 extra for 3D. We picked out our seats and made our way upstairs. Drinks and food are a bit pricier, but expected. We ordered an appetizer sampler and our food came out very quickly and at the beginning of the movie, which was good timing. The food did nothing for either one of us, and I actually felt a little sick later. We ordered the popcorn in the middle of the movie, after picking at the appetizer sampler, thinking it was a safe bet. There were more kernels that didn't pop then popped, and there was no butter.  Also, keep in mind, the servers have to talk to the patrons during the movie, so if that won't bother you, you are in good shape.  Overall, I would go back because the theater is nice, the chairs are comfortable and $5 is reasonable for a movie, but I wouldn't order food again."}
{"text":"I do enjoy going to the Movie Studio Grill. I will be going back.   Definitely buy online and pick your seats. Get seats several rows back from the front. E-F-G-H-I rows are excellent views and you don't have the staff blocking your view during the movie while they are delivering food/drinks.  Why I didn't give it a 5 star-two reasons.  1.Last three times I have gone I have asked for a glass of ice along with my wine, I have had to ask a second time every time for the ice. Not a really big deal, but they promote their customer service/attention to detail everywhere.  2. I couldn't post a pic :(- the pic I took would show you soooo much better than my words can say. One glass of wine is approx. $7. The amount of wine I received was less than 6 oz. I have the exact same wine glasses a home. I took a picture of the wine I got, then compared it to the 6 oz. I poured at home. It was definitely less. So, to solve that problem I bought a bottle for approx. $23! The movie start times are as expected, 15 minutes past the time they are published, so don't worry if you are running late. Lastly, they do offer to validate parking in the garage at the EpiCentre for 4 hours, not valet, so don't forget your parking ticket/stub when you go in!  Side note: We have enjoyed the food we have had (steak quesadilla, sliders)   Enjoy your movie :)"}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to go to a premiere night here to see Wonder for free. However, we found the service to be lacking. Our server, Jamaia, took my husband's order for a can of beer. That's all, 1 can of beer. He never got it, even after telling multiple people that he had not received his order. Maybe they aren't used to a full theatre. Terrible service. Heard several others say the same thing."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with a \"dine-in\" movie theater and it was pretty awesome. I wasn't aware they offered a full bar and pool tables or I would've dropped by even earlier to hang before my movie. The staff was extremely nice and informative, as I had to ask how things worked. The food was surprisingly delicious and the service was just as wonderful. My only complaint is that I had no idea where I was supposed to go upon entering. So, I did end up wandering around a bit, but in the end it all worked out.   I'm honestly not sure why some people complain about the service. I think given the number of people they have to serve in such a short window, they did an incredible job. Like I said, everyone was very friendly and my service was prompt and accommodating.   I'll be back again."}
{"text":"How does one ruin the moviegoing experience...let me tell you.   First, only two people were working the tickets so there was a line almost out the door...and this is on a Monday @7.  I used the machines to get my own ticket but it was so dark I could barely see.  It was assigned seating and of course when I got to my seat we were all bunched together...which I hate.  Second, there are no concessions but you rather order from a server once you are seated.  So I order a popcorn and soda.  The soda comes about 30 minutes later, in a huge plastic glass, with no ice, and its warm.  I never got the popcorn.  Third, when I ordered I tried to close out the tab then and there but was told I couldn't...something about \"the law\" not allowing it.  I don't remember learning that in law school so it must be a state law thing...Fourth, I was never brought my check (and actually never saw the server again after he brought me my soda) and when I flagged down a server he couldn't find my bill, and told me it was on the house.  Now I have to keep an eye out for my card statement to make sure I wasn't charged some random amount (they can have the $5 for the popcorn).    I get that this place is trying to go fancy.  There is a full menu, nice leather seats, and you push a button to get your server.  But all of these things should make things better, and in this case, for whatever reason, it made them worse.  I would have rather had a concession stand and been able to sit where I wanted...I won't be going back."}
{"text":"A very nice experience overall.   The auditorium was clean, the sound and picture flawless. Our seats resembled the front seats out of modern Volvo or a Gulfstream. Very comfortable. The middle armrest of each pair of seats lifts to get out of the way if you are in the mood for some PDA. Towards the front of the theater there were other seats that resembled office chairs on wheels, and were pushed up against a desk-height counter. We didn't try them but I think the experience in those would be significantly less pleasant.  The food was actually not bad. I paid about $12 for a half-pound burger with cheese and 'shrooms, served with sweet potato fries. The $9 martinis weren't really that impressive, only being filled about 2/3rd of the way.   Service was prompt and efficient, and the staff does a good job of not getting in the way of the picture.  I went there with the Groupon ($6 for ticket and softdrink). At that price it's a steal, though I would consider going back even at the full price."}
{"text":"Groupon $5 movie tickets! Great deal. Just wish they had more times, chairs get booked quick"}
{"text":"The seats were comfortable but did not recline.  The service was poor.  Several times they tried to bring us food and drinks we did not order.  The potato skins were cold and sliders were barely warm.  If I go there again I'll eat before."}
{"text":"I love this place comfy seats good food and specials on drinks and food during the week. One issue when the place is packed food can be severely delayed. It's in a great location in the center of uptown plus the validate parking."}
{"text":"My friend was given free tickets to come here and we were excited to give it a try. The service here is great.  The staff, whether at the box office or the servers, were all very friendly and professional. There was a line at the box office but it moved quickly and we got our tickets and were let into the theater right away. Focusing on the positives still, the sound and picture quality were probably best I have ever seen/heard. You can really tell a lot of money consideration and money went into the technology. Our server was very friendly and explained how ordering/paying worked since it was out first time. There was one rather big disappoint though and that was seating. Its auditoreum style wannabe. The row in front of us was only slightly lower than than the row I was seated in so there was an issue with people's heads getting in the way, and I'm tall. The chairs are typical office chairs. Like that swivel and are on rollers. I was expecting something more along the lines of the new AMC Esplanade theater.  The food was really good. reasonably priced. The drinks were expensive and weak. We ordered an appetizer and a pizza to split. They were both delivered at the same time. The appetizer was wrong and we sent it back and kept the pizza. 20 minutes later they brought us the correct appetizer and another pizza. We should have kept the pizza because it was delicious and we wanted more, but were honest and explained we had already received it. 15 minutes later someone else came by with the same appetizer and apologized for taking so long. We again told them we had already received the correct appetizer and sent it back. We weren't upset about the mistakes especially since the servers were nice and apologetic and did what they could to make things right (and succeeded). Overall we had a good time, but probably won't come back. The theater and seats were left much to be desired and it is a bit out of the way as I live in Peoria and the friend I was with lives in Central Phx."}
{"text":"We used a groupn to try this place out. The atmosphere is good, the movie and seats were awesome, but the service isn't that good. The find also wasn't worth the price. I will just go watch the movies there but I would not eat there"}
{"text":"I get what they are trying to do here,  but the execution is terrible. I just went to see a movie here with my husband and a friend. The food came before the drinks for all three of us. Mine, I just got a Cider on draft, I had my wings, which were spicy and needed to be washed down with my drink, 30 minutes prior to the drink. Needless to say, the wings were cold by that time. Our friend got the coconut tenders first, and just went ahead and started eating. His drink came around 10 minutes later. My husband got his food and his drink never came and he had to reorder his. It was just a Pepsi. I finished my meal and ordered a second drink over an hour before the movie ended, but it never came. They never even told me it would not be coming. If you choose this place, eat before you get there, and I hope you are not thirsty."}
{"text":"I've been going to this theater for several years, but the quality has been declining. We went to see black panther in 3D, and the glasses they gave everyone were so bad people either left or took the glasses off to watch it. Also, our food was completely cold. I've always liked studio movie grill but this last experience made me never want to go back"}
{"text":"card at the door or dont card at all for r rated movies. im 17 and my friend was 16 big whoop. dont lie and say that her dad called when her dads dead u ******. ran by liars and mean people. kicked me out rudly saying that were underage when one of us was 17."}
{"text":"I used to really love Studio Movie Grill. The Groupon deals, combined with getting to eat dinner during the movie, made this place my number one place for seeing most movies. If the food was only slightly better than adequate, well, it was still better than eating nachos and a soft pretzel for dinner at AMC.   The last two times I've been to SMG, the food has gotten progressively worse, to the point where I received a hamburger so burned that I could smell the charred meat immediately after they set it in front of me. Not wanting to interrupt my movie, I smothered it in mustard and choked it down, but my husband later told me the people next to us sent their food back. And there were only 5 of us in the theater, so that means they pretty much ruined everyone's food.  The seats are just okay. Having finally experienced the recliners at Arrowhead AMC (yes, I know I'm behind the times), I can't say they are all that special.   The bathrooms are continually very messy and I noted 4 unflushed toilets in a row. Apparently they don't check the bathrooms very often, because I have noted this from the beginning.   So unless I hear from someone that they've gotten their act together and made this place worth the drive (I live in Peoria), I'm not going to bother. Even at Groupon prices, I think I'd rather go to AMC or Harkins instead."}
{"text":"Today I went with my husband to watch \"into the woods\", the last time we came was for \" big hero 6\". Since then, the service changed a lot. And we are SMG customers since 1 year ago. Not to mention the new commercial about their food, and the quality is so low now, I'm not sure why they advertise wrong. We ordered the Sunday special of 10 DLL endless pizza... We got the first one on a normal size then the 2 others were a 5\" pizza's. And now they have a new fee of 3.50 to use the food service inside. Also, From almost 30 people between waiters to the ones who placed your orders, now I saw 2 during the whole movie. Waited a long time for someone to take our order and then 30+ minutes for a cup of water and food. Don't know why they are so short on employees but definitely drove a way down from what it used to be."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place a higher rating, but had several problems during the Tarzan showing the wife and I went to.  When the show started we noticed that the sound quality was off.  It wasn't that horrible where you couldn't hear the movie at all, but it took the management about 20-30 minutes to try to fix it.  They paused the film and after about 10 minutes played it again, to no avail.  The staff member told us that if we wanted to leave we could get a refund, but that we still had to pay for our food.  Yeah that kind of ruined our experience and while they did give us a free movie pass, they charged us full price for our food (Maybe 1/2 off would redeem themselves?) and did not seem that apologetic for ruining our movie visit."}
{"text":"Cool concept but unorganized service. I visited this movie theater for the first time but was very disappointed. The whole benefit of going is to eat and drink while watching the movie right...well the process of ordering and getting my food was pure chaos. I was asked by the staff did I order things I never ordered several times which was annoying and then when my food came which I did order it was cold. Not to mention I had to wait in line to get my check after the movie because it wasn't brought to me like all the other guests. I wouldn't go again but I can say I tried it."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I arrived on a Wednesday night about 5 minutes before the movie was to start. Once seated in a cheap office chair, I placed an order for a diet soda and chips and salsa.   The food was pouring out all movie. Right next to me in fact. I had the displeasure in ending up in the seat next to where the servers stage their food delivery. Nothing like a metal tray of food set up next to you every 10 minutes.   So having never been here, I had no idea how long things take. Finally after 35 minutes, I mention to a server that I was yet to receive my drink or food. 10 minutes later I get a watered down diet Pepsi with about 4 ice cubes in it. I also was assured my chips and salsa were coming right out.   15 minutes pass and still no food. I flagged down a lovely girl who was handling checks. I informed her that after over an hour I no longer cared to get the chips I asked for. I was hungry, especially after an hour of food deliveries. But at this point, who needs $5 chips and salsa.   After paying for me flat, oft delayed soda and exiting the theater, I voiced my displeasure with the manager. Having once worked at the movies as a manager, I expected more than just a \"sorry.\"   Needless to say, this was my first and last visit to this theater."}
{"text":"I really like this place. But to be honest, Ive only gone on a sunday and a monday. Seemed like our group was the only one in the theatre   The place is very nicely designed, you can just feel how modern it is when you walk in. Tickets are not anymore expensive then going to a regular theater. Got a beer which was around 6 dollars, not too expensive considering it is a movie theatre. I ordered a grilled chicken burger with sweet potato fries and it was surprisingly delicious. The fries seemed like it was unlimited, couldn't even finish all the food I had.  Leather seats were comfortable and service was polite. Overall a great experience"}
{"text":"I read a lot of reviews of this place on Google last night and almost didn't go because the reviews were pretty bad. I'm glad I went though, because it turned out to be an enjoyable experience. Went there last night to see Sinister. Although the movie wasn't that good, the theatre was pretty nice. I've been to a few others of these kind of restaurant/theatre places in Alaska and Washington, and Studio Movie Grill is doing just fine with this concept.   Didn't really like the assigned seating, especially since there was someone sitting in my seat. It's kind of pointless unless there is someone there to enforce the assigned seating. It would be better if people could just sit according to first-come-first-serve like in any movie theatre.   I read that there were single office chairs for the seating, and this is true for the center rows. Office chairs that swiveled and rolled. Different, but surprisingly comfortable.   I liked that there was a light box at your seat you can push to get service. Makes it simple and obvious for the staff to find you. I also liked that there were lights underneath the counter face in front of you. It wasn't directly shining in your eyes, but still allowed you to read the menu.   The menu prices were a little high, but it's Scottsdale. I also unknowingly showed up on all-you-can-eat pizza night, which was excellent, and much more valuable.   Overall, I thought this place was pretty good. I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"New menu .. Going to miss the hummus appetizer but the new choices look good.. Magi mahi fish n chips were given a try and the Cali burger I am sure is great.  I want the blue burger back though !!! Hear me people ?"}
{"text":"good food and drinks while you enjoy the movie, must chek it out."}
{"text":"Had a great time watching a movie last week. Ordered a beer and appetizer. The only negative thing about the experience was that one of the speakers in the theater was blown. So it had a horrible sound when the bass was high during the movie. Lessened the experience."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this movie theater for years and consistently enjoy our experience. Now, to be totally fair I haven't tried any of the food because I've heard from other people that it's often cold and that isn't a gamble I am willing to take. We've tried various alcoholic drinks and liked them all. The validated parking is awesome. They give you enough time to enjoy some of the other places in the EpiCentre before or after the movie. I also like that we get to pick our actual seats (which is great for people like us who are often coming in right when the previews start).   I will say that there are some things I don't like about SMG. First of all, you used to be able to ride the escalator from the box office to the movie theater. You now have to go outside and go up the stairs. Not a big deal but not fun in rain and kind of irritating. The other thing is that the last time we went, we noticed the seats were different. The armrests didn't lift up and the chairs were much more firm. We both agreed that we like the old seats better. Not sure if it was just the particular movie theater room we were in or if this was a change throughout. Finally, the bathroom is often out of toilet paper, soap, etc. Luckily I keep Kleenex and hand sanitizer on hand at all times. We get the Groupons and I hate that they've put restrictions on when you can use them (and even what movies you can use them on - i.e. does not apply for batman vs. superman) because it used to be that there were no restrictions and that, my friends, was awesome."}
{"text":"Throw the whole staff away and start over. I'm not one to write negative reviews. In fact, this is my first one. The movie was at 1:15 on a weekday and there were only a handful of people in the whole place. My wife and I ordered a picture of beer and 2 entrees. An hour past before our beer came and the food never did. Two hours into the movie and no sign of the server. I figured somebody would have came and gave us an explanation of their terrible service. There wasn't a peep from anybody. I had to go to the ticket check booth and tell them to cancel our order. This place isn't even worthy of 1 star. They need to get it together. The staff could care less that our food never came. It was almost like they have been through the song and dance so much that they were numb to it. This place sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to see Dragon Ball Z Battle of The Gods. I think this is a VERY nice concept. Initially I was concerned about volume since the servers would be taking orders and bringing food throughout the movie but it wasn't even noticeable. My friend and I ordered popcorn, pizza, cheese fries and a drink. Wasn't the best food ever but I was happy to drink a Long Island and watch a movie. Popcorn was your regular movie popcorn so it was awesome. I'm going tonight and will try something else."}
{"text":"Terrible food, awful service. Burgers are a large bun with a little patty of what could be beef. Forget the ketchup or mustard, or bring it from home. Waiters do not bring it. Popcorn is excessively salty but don't expect to get refreshment refills. The waiters will ignore you. This could be a nice place but service is terrible and the food, when it finally arrives, is terrible too. Find another theatre."}
{"text":"Love it here. Always willing to make the drive for a good movie, beer and food. Very clean, fast service and amazing server customer service. Sometimes the ladies in the ticket booth can get a little bitchy. Also, amazing ticket deals on groupon $5 and at the movies is $10"}
{"text":"SMG has frequently been a less-than-amazing experience but it is the closest theater to my neighborhood so, last night friends and I have it another chance. The experience was altogether disastrous. Upon entering, the bouncers were rude and offered us no direction whatsoever for claiming our pre-purchased tickets. We later discovered that they were setting up for an event that was taking place shortly after our movie started - which perhaps explains why they treated us an an inconvenience rather than customers. After standing in the wrong line for 10 minutes, we went to the self service area and the scanner for our bar code was broken. After finally getting our tickets to print, this is where the real let down begins. The food we ordered was sub par at best. The pretzel bites, pizza and chicken tinders all came out cold. We never saw our server again and we were certainly never checked on or offered refills. Each time another server would walk past, they would say things under their breath assuming that the sound of the movie would mask it-it did not. When our movie came to an end, we were informed by another bouncer that we could not return to the lower lobby to have our parking validated. After waiting behind the velvet rope for 25 minutes we finally were offered help by what seemed to be a manager. He took my parking ticket and the tickets of two other groups. As he walked off he told us we had to remain standing in the same order so that he could return the tickets to the correct party. When he finally returned, 10 minutes later, he offered no apology whatsoever and by this time, several event-goers had entered the exit doors while movie patrons left and were smoking in the hall beside us. He said nothing to them before we left. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Cool concept for a full-service bar and restaurant, while you relax in plush chairs and enjoy the show.   The food price is comparable compared to, say, a Chili's. But then again, you are paying for the ambiance.  Plush seating, wide aisles - makes me feel like I'm sitting in those automated chairs in Wall-E!"}
{"text":"Just went to Studio Movie Grill and the seats were comfortable, that's about all I can say good about it. They had a \"lens\" problem on the screen that made the whole screen look over-exposed and slightly out of focus. And one of the speakers had a problem so the sound was bad as well. According to another review this has been a situation for over at least two weeks. Dealing with the epicenter was barely worth it before, now? Not a chance."}
{"text":"Everything is usually great here.  The only thing is that they don't keep their bathrooms clean. Often the ladies room is so dirty that I walk out. It says a lot about a place.  Just wish they would be more mire aware of the importance of clean facilities.  After all the employees use these restrooms and then go out and help guest.  It's a nasty thought to be honest."}
{"text":"My review is so mixed....first, the concept and \"idea\" of Studio Movie Grill is amazing. Sadly, the staff is running the place into the ground. Management seems to be on their game, but overwhelmed by staff that would give the zombies on walking dead a run for their money. Don't get me wrong, i have visited before and there are a few gems, but mostly dirt. This would probably be a one star, but Star Wars premier+Halon system going off in the kitchen=a nightmare night for any business. Staff \"could\" have made this a stellar evening, but dropped the ball."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our time at Studio Movie Grill to celebrate my husband's  birthday.. The beauty of this movie theater is selecting your seat in advance to see new releases. They  have plenty of seating and nice lounge chairs. I would just call to make sure your not getting the office chairs. We had trouble with a  groupon deal so we decided to just book with the theater directly which was more worth it. ( Groupon deal you have to wait two weeks for new releases!)   To order food you simply press a button for service. I was impressed that the order came to the right seat. We heard the chicken tenders  were lack luster and decided to get burgers. I ordered the Three cheese sliders with sweet potato fries. They  do charge for anything extra like my side of bbq sauce. The sliders were really delicious and filling. I ended up packing one for home!   My husband's Bacon BBQ Burger had nicely seasoned fries and he said the burger was surprisingly good.  The only hiccups with food I would have to point out were my fries were not served  hot and my husband's  burger was missing a piece of bacon. Also, the waiters should try to bring the bill sometime later not at the climax of the movie!  But overall, it was a fun experience and memorable. I would recommend this place for celebrations or a special date night."}
{"text":"Unusual seats that rock and roll. Depending on the row your seat is in, you may have a regular theater seat or one of the rolling chairs.  A pitcher of margaritas will make any movie be awesome. Well, almost all movies. I don't think Blade Runner was salvageable. But the margaritas were wonderful and helped the movie along. Two pitchers might have made this movie  a darkly poetic, thought-inducing extravaganza.  The actual venue is pretty cool . If you have upgraded to dine-in movie theatre  experiences, then this place will definitely be your cup of tea.  Parking here can be a challenge if you happen to arrive as multiple movies are showing and lots of families are eating at the restaurants surrounding the movie theater."}
{"text":"We love Studio Movie Grill, as a whole, but the last FOUR visits we have had nothing but problems! We've tried talking to managers, they've made every excuse imaginable, and yet each visit ANOTHER problem. I understand that everyone has bad days but again, 4 bad experiences IN A ROW! Today is my husband's birthday so we really wanted an enjoyable, easy experience but that's not what we got. We were cutting it really close to the movie start time (not a problem since we had already paid for & chosen our seats) so I pulled up the menu online so we could decide what we wanted to eat, simple enough right? Nope. We sat down in our seats, immediately pushed our button, and for once the server was quick to appear. We started our order but could tell the server was having trouble working her tablet, we thought because she was new, but then she informs us the menu items have changed and we'll have to choose something else. Keep in mind I JUST looked at the menu online during the drive over, I point this out and she looks at us with a dumbfounded look, so I ask for a manager to come and take our order. The 'supervisor' comes to take our order and again we are told the menu items have changed. What we are asking for is still on the menu, it's just no longer on the 2 for $25 special (it was a pizza my teenage son wanted, pizza IS still on the special but now it's a one topping instead) and since we are regulars (@ 3 visits a month) I ask them to honor the special still listed on the website and that's when the 'supervisor' says she needs a 'manager'... I'm sorry, I thought that's who I was already talking to, nope again! We wait for yet ANOTHER person to come speak with us (the movie has now started and they are talking through it) and he says I'm looking at the wrong menu and that they are a smaller location with different pricing. I proceed to show him my phone and point out what I was looking at *spoiler alert* I was right! He informs me that the menu prices just changed yesterday but furious that I'm now missing the beginning of the movie my family paid $8 each to go see @2:30pm on a Tuesday (not busy at all) I demand he honor the price. After huffing at me, he says fine and then WALKS OFF sending yet another person back to actually take the order because God forbid he actually do it himself!!! After missing several minutes of our movie the fiasco is finally taken care of but this wasn't the end of the problems, our drinks never come! The 3rd time we asked for them another server says \"fine, I'll get them myself\" and storms off. Really? Us actually wanting our drinks is a problem!?! Our server finally comes back 2/3 of the way through the movie, interrupting us AGAIN, to say our card was declined. Seriously? We never gave her a card, we were paying in cash so I have no idea whose card she was trying to run to pay our tab, and when we try to tell her this (while trying to look around her to see the movie we paid so much to see) she steps in front of us to block our view completely! Each of these things all by themselves are annoying but add them together and it's infuriating. AFTER the movie is over I see the first 'supervisor' and decide to go say something, her attitude was astonishing, snotty even. The 'manager' we talked to walks up and his attitude isn't any better. I'm standing there trying to explain to them what went wrong and they don't seem to understand why we are upset. The 'supervisor' says she has to take care of something in the kitchen and walks off just as the 'General Manager' walks up and interjects himself into the conversation. He seemed shocked as well that we are upset so I explain it again and his response set me off \"well we've taken care of you so what more do you want?\"...Seriously!?! First of all, we paid for our meal so I don't understand what he means by \"we've taken care of you\" because all they did was bring us our food which IS their job! Second of all, being rude to pissed off customers is NOT the smartest move, especially coming from the GENERAL MANAGER!!! Needless to say, this will be our LAST visit to Studio Movie Grill at the Epicenter. Finally, while walking to the elevator, we see the 'supervisor' outside smoking a cigarette, talking to an employee of the bar next door... THAT was her emergency in the kitchen??? Just another lovely day in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Had a great time ordering food and drinks while waiting for the movie to start was fun. The staff was amazing!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new movie theater so we decided on this one and it turned out to be AWESOME! This theater is in the \"EPICENTRE-Charlotte\" and is around a bunch of interesting shops that sits in the middle of several stories high near uptown Charlotte.  The views are amazing of the Charlotte city skyline as you walk to the theater. Once inside we noticed the whole place is really modern with fancy chandeliers and wild crazy cool lighting. To get to the actual movie theater room you have to go up a really cool escalator with blue lights and carpet on the walls! Once we found our seats, directions appear on the big screen letting you know you can order lots of different kinds of food and drinks ANYTIME during the movie, WOW! We had popcorn, then pizza all served during the movie. The seats are an upscale black leather styled slightly reclining chair with a fold out wooden table that has a button to call a server. Sound and picture quality are excellent as well as the price was very reasonable. We definitely will come back again!  Parking is validated if you park inside the EPICENTRE. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Fifteen minutes late for my movie and they had locked the doors. Two other people were turned away at the same time. I couldn't get my parking validated so I basically paid for half of a movie ticket and got nothing. Fun drive home. I get closing registers after all of your movies start, but fifteen minutes? The only thing I would have missed were the credits. Frustrating."}
{"text":"Studio movie grill is a great concept.  Being able to go to a movie and choose from options to eat and drink that don't include just popcorn and nachos is quite refreshing.   They also offer awesome groupons every once in a while that helps you save and have more money for food or drinks!  Id make this place my movie spot if it wasnt so far from oldtown. Great experience for a date or families"}
{"text":"Went to see the 10:00pm showing on 11/24 of Hunger Games.  On Groupon, they had a deal that was being advertised with a Hunger Games banner, and said, \"Buy now and see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 tonight!\"  I bought it... when I got there twenty minutes later the girl said my deal wasn't eligible for the Hunger Games.  I asked her to show me where on my deal it said there were any exclusions as there were none.    The place was empty.  The entire reserved theater was available on the screen, and they turn down legit business.  Went to Harkins on Shea instead."}
{"text":"I want so badly to be a fan of this place but the service just leaves something to be desired! I have many times had a great experience here but had always heard others complain. After last night, I can see why. I will say on the dining end: the coconut chicken tenders are fantastic, the spinach dip is great but the chips are thin strips and make it impossible to actually dip, and the drink specials are something that you can't beat while enjoying a movie. However, they only seated us 15 minutes before the movie started. In the past I have arrived 45 prior and started enjoying my food before the movie started. Then it took us at least 30 min from ordering to get a glass of water, we asked 3 waiters! Finally our bill was incorrect and that took an additional 20 minutes after the film ended to settle. Please Please SMG put the customer experience first because currently it feels last."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit there and will be the last; a wrong choice of movie(Black Panther)didn't help but mainly the service and food quality for the price didn't match to my expectation.  A waitress told Pepsi has no caffeine to us when I was discouraging a kid from drinking caffeinated & carbonated drink! A server brought an item I didn't order when there were only five customers, and no utensils for my salad. When I asked, he threw them on the counter. Only positive outcome was Rib Dinner was decent but my Chicken salad was lame, no more $60 for disappointment. PS: I don't have sensitive hearing but SOUND was too loud, we had to cover ears occasionally."}
{"text":"Me, the boyfriend and our double date(s?) went to check out the Great and Powerful Oz last night... He's an okay guy... The theater was pretty cool, too... The staff was very pleasant and helpful, which is already a huge plus for me...  First, if you went to Mez, you'll be overall familiar with the layout... The lounge area looks virtually the same... I remember the chandeliers and various light fixtures, the ultra modern swanky furniture and the glowy disco elevator ride up from the ticket counter... I still like the look of this place... The drinks we all had were decent... I had the New Orleans Hurricane, our friends had the Raspberry Mojito and Longer Island Iced Tea (thumbs up to both, according to them) and the boyfriend had a Nutter Butter Frozen situation...  Yep, you heard me... Nutter Butter... It was kind of like a mudslide, but completely smooth peanut buttery goodness topped off with an actual Nutter Butter cookie and whipped cream... With alcohol... Ridiculously, fantastically awesome... My 'Cane was rummy in my tummy... That was so corny that I had to leave it in there after it popped in my head... lol  It was very tasty, though... Truly...   The button was nice... Instead of having to carry your food and drinks in with you or going back outside while missing the movie when your buzzer goes off, now you can just press a magic button and things will find their way to you!  The food that we ordered was top notch... I had the BBQ chicken pizza... It came out piping hot and piled with toppings... The crust was well-baked, the sauce was savory and the veggies were crisp... One of the best BBQ chicken pizzas I've had, actually... A+... The Thai chicken pizza was flavorful... Honestly, I was going to order this initially but I was a little worried about the quality of the peanut sauce they use... I shouldn't have been... It was the perfect balance of nutty and spicy... Let me tell you, I don't even like coconut, so believe me when I tell you: The coconut chicken tenders were out of this world!  They were so crunchy and juicy... I was really impressed... Lastly, the boyfriend ordered the chicken nachos... The toppings were really fresh and practically bounced off the nacho... The chicken was also very well-seasoned, in my opinion... Just make sure you get a fork... They really pile those toppings on...   Now with all that fabulousness, here come the parts that didn't fare so well... First, while the ticket attendant was very nice, their process of using a marker instead of just ripping the tickets in half seems a little cumbersome... They are already passing out menus for folks as well, so either having another person with menus or buying actual tickets with stubs would be quicker for busier nights... It wasn't too bad yesterday, but I would be curious to know how it works out in a rush... Second, I'm sure they're still working on the inside the movie service training because it's new, but two things went less than smoothly: one of the servers was wearing jewelry that made noise whenever they walked and the drink service was spotty... I actually didn't even notice the noise until someone pointed it out to me because apparently I was lost in the magical world of James Franco, but afterward, I couldn't miss it... It sounded like bangles clanging against each other... Not really cool in the midst of a hush-hush place like a movie theater... Also, I ordered a beer (not from the button, with one of our three or four servers) and it didn't show up... It showed up on the bill, though and I asked the server about it... He said he could bring it out since there was another 45 minutes left, so he did that... Also, the boyfriend ordered water which never showed up... I think because we had so many people waiting on us, it was easy to miss... Having one server per row or section would probably keep things like that to a minimum... Or maybe I'll just keep pressing the magic button instead of ordering directly from the servers... lol   Overall, I had a ball... I'll definitely be back again... But it's definitely pricey, so watch your wallet... lol"}
{"text":"Overall a good experience especially when you don't want to pay the price for a ticket for the IPIC theater. The only thing that needs fixing is the chairs. they are just ok. not the most comfortable. Drinks are a little pricey as well."}
{"text":"The best thing you can do on a cold and raining day instead of staying home is to go watch a movie.   We went to watch Arthur Christmas, very cute movie.  It was the last day for their free movie offer.   The dine-in concept is similar to AMC and iPic.  You order your movie online and pick up at the counter.  They call the movie title and time through a speaker so you stand in to enter inside the theater.  A nice and large open area for to wait. They have two or three long rows of table counters with office chair seats.   I wonder who decided to cut back and use office chairs.  According to my Sister, the chair was so uncomfortable.   I though it was tacky to use office chairs.   I sat in the back with the individual seat and sliding table.  It doesn't recline, but comfy and large enough to place my jacket and purse.   There was a button on the table for you to press for service.  Server tries to take your order before the movie starts.   I ordered a hot coffee and a basket of sweet potato fries.  The potion of fries was decent for $4.50.  The taste wasn't any fancy fries, just ok.   The coffee took a little longer.   I think they ran out and had to brew a new batch.   It sure tasted fresh.  They have a lot of staffs working in one theater.  It does get confusing who you want talk to.  They wait staff that places the order and runners that deliver the food and drink.    I found the price for a movie is really inexpensive compared to other dine-in theaters.   They have specials which is even cheaper.  I will definitely return for another movie, and hopefully I will have a hot freshly- brewed coffee too."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place. I do not recommend the food to anyone. It was so gross I almost shit my pants. Please do yourself a favor and pass on this place."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this theater is no matter what row, you have space between the next so if you need to get up and sneak out during the movie you aren't climbing over people. Yes, the rows alternate between seats with tray table things and office chairs against a counter. You can distinguish which seats are which if you pay enough attention to detail on the seating map.   I think this place gets a bad rep. For a dine in theater this place is wonderfully average. However, I don't expect gourmet food from a movie theater, so I think you should always have your expectations managed before trying somewhere.  You have a button at your seat which you push when you would like service, you can order throughout the movie although most people do it before it starts (I've never had insane amounts of interruptions any time I've been). They drop your check shortly before the movie ends. It's standard bar food really, like a mini Applebee's in a theater. The food is basic but edible and drinks are fine as well. For the overall experience I enjoy coming here. I don't come here for the food, I eat because I'm hungry and didn't have time to do a separate dinner. If you want a totally uninterrupted, cinematic movie experience, I advise you not to go somewhere where they serve food and drink. Yes, you get the occasional employee darting across the aisle to serve someone if you are in a crowded theater, but what else do you expect??  The waitstaff is ALWAYS super friendly here. They do a great job in a harder environment."}
{"text":"Best theater in town. Great food and the only place you can eat dinner and have a cocktail at a new release in HD"}
{"text":"Employees are friendly.  Food is surprisingly good.  Go for the milkshake!  They have a nice bar and lobby.  I don't like the desk chairs as much as the regular seats though.  I def like the deals on Groupon."}
{"text":"First visit to any movie theater in Charlotte so decided to just hit a few bullet points since this was my first time at a theater that served food at the seats.   Likes:  - Stadium seating & extremely comfortable - Nice BIG screens & acoustics were great - Full service food/drink ordering from your seat  - Staff was very welcoming, attentive & friendly. - Great customer service - Located near tons of restaurants & bars - Assigned seating (Arrive before hand to order food/drinks)   Dislikes: - Location: Uptown so be prepared to pay for parking - Waiters brought wrong ticket 4 times - Constantly being asked by staff to pass down tickets & drinks which were wrong so they came back. During the best parts of the freaking movie.  - Popcorn was stale & completely soft (no crunch) - For late comers, staff should have flashlights as people sat in wrong seats which caused confusion to those watching the movie."}
{"text":"This was my first experience of movie eating and drinking.  I had a great time!  We were a party of six and were able to all sit together.  The office chairs could be a little better, not the most comfortable I have ever sat in.  Other then that, bravo.  Waiter was good.  Prices were reasonable.  Movie was very funny and it was a great evening all the way around.  What's not to like? Movie, cocktail, food."}
{"text":"Staff is so loud in the theater you can hear their headsets as they walk by. Nearly impossible to get a drink under 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Saw the new James Bond there yesterday - The sound was absolutely incredible...Nice to be able to order food and drinks from your seat - My mojito was absolutely delicious...."}
{"text":"I liked the concept, which is why I tried it out, but the experience was not exactly what I imagined it to be.  For instance, the chair situation? A, B, C, etc. So the \"highly mobile\" chairs in front of the really long table you can share with a large group of people are just pleather office chairs that they placed in the movie theater. The couple chairs that are not mobile are the sofa seats that I wish were mobile, as in having the ability to prop the seat back.  The whole food service system was more distracting than I thought it would be. All throughout the previews and about 30 min into the movie, there are many waiters just going back and forth right in front of you to take people's orders or bring them food. Soo.. that means, you can't see what's going on on the screen, you can't hear what's going on, and you can't focus for several seconds every several minutes for a total of 45 minutes.  The food was meh. The service was mixed. Our initial waiter was very friendly. But we wait for our food to come out, and ours is pretty much one of the last to arrive even though we ordered it before the previews started playing. My friend and I ordered popcorn as an appetizer but after our entree appeared first, we had to ask where our appetizer was and then the waiter simply dumped this whole thing of popcorn onto our small tables, expecting us to just deal with it, and scurried away."}
{"text":"A great experience! The theater has comfortable leather seats with plenty of elbow room. The lobby is modern and inviting featuring a bar and lounge seating. It isn't necessarily cheap however with a Groupon its definitely a great value. The food as tasty especially considering its a theater and not a restaurant. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys watching a good movie in comfort with a beer and a burger on hand!"}
{"text":"Surprised on how rundown or not up to par this place is... the seats and tables are not wiped down in the theatre.. i will go to the AMC theatres which are a little nicer.. felt this one was in the hood per say.. just felt cruddy.."}
{"text":"Studio Movie grilled is located right off Frank Lloyd Right and Pima area - a bit tricky to find but right in the middle of tons of businesses. Studio Movie Grill is a Movie Theatre that serves food and beverages. This being our first visit I picked the seats that are office chairs on wheels, I did not most evereyone has the full non moving chairs that look a bit more comportable.  Movie; The sound and screen were acceptable.   Food; We shared a dinner special that was tasty - the chicken tenders were fresh and good.   Service; The service initally was amazing, but forgetting we are supposed to call for service dessert was never served."}
{"text":"I took my son to Studio Movie Grill and boy was I suprised and not in a good way! For starters I ordered from the two for $25 menu and selected a healthy option, the blackened chicken salad and my son ordered a pizza and sweet tea; well my salad came about 35 minutes after I put in my order but it was too salty to eat and my son got a unsweetened ice tea! I informed them of the salty salad and with an attitude the server said \"we'll do you want something else?\" I asked for a Caesar salad and it was terrible! I asked for water when they first took my order and even though I asked 4 different servers for my water and my sons sweet tea, it was not brought to me until I went out and found the manager and informed her of the salty salad that left my mouth dry as a desert! The water finally came about 20 minutes before the end of the show along with my sons sweet tea; but the bill came right after the water with both the sweetened and unsweetened teas and a suggested tip! Well maybe the servers at studio movie Grill need to understand the acronym TIP stands for \"To Insure Proper Service!\"   On my way out I stopped at the bathroom and boy was that a mistake! The bathroom was disgusting! Tissue all over the floor, lights out in some of the stalls, no hand soap, water all over the counter and garbage that was overflowing!  The manager is really trying to do her best, but the servers need to work on their serving and people skills!   The only good thing was the validation for the free parking!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I had been here, let have to say it was pretty awesome! Kid friendly and the food was good too. Who don't like to eat and relax watching a movie. If that's you this place is not for you, but it was for me! Will I come back? Sure will!"}
{"text":"This was an awesome experience!! Real talk I haven't been to the movies in years.... literally years.... so I basically leaped at the idea of going to the movies to see Black Panther.   The idea of French fries, burgers, and legal beer drinking was definitely inspiring .... and the menu actually had several choices. They have a few different pasta choices, flat breads and good looking pizza. They have 5 burger choices......   I arrived about 15 mins before the movie started.... naturally I was a little confused with the notion of pushing a button for service... but like clock work and cheery waitress showed up and took our order.....  My burger was decent .... I got the Megatron Burger with mushrooms and bacon and all things glorious!! It was just ok thou..... not necessarily bad and not necessarily good.... but I went with the flow because nearly every seat in the theater was taken and I imagined the kitchen was completely backed up.... my wife on the other hand ordered a salad and that salad took literally 1 hour to arrive and was salty when it did..... my fries were deliciously fried but not warm enough to even make it thru ten mins.....  Over all I enjoyed the heck outta the movie and the experience.... I will definitely be returning to the movies."}
{"text":"Good food and service! A good date night spot.. Having said that, what you should also know is that if you prefer to watch a movie completely uninterrupted, this may not be where you want to watch it. You will notice the servers moving around, taking people's orders, bringing out the food & check etc. They try to be as invisible as possible - wearing black, and speaking softly, but we're so accustomed to not seeing figures move around in a dark movie theater, that it can be somewhat distracting.  The food was good - the appetizers especially. I ordered a salad (kale and avocado) for my main course, which I didn't love, and also, it wasn't the ideal dish to eat in a dark theater.. I wish I'd have realized that when I ordered it, then I wouldn't have eaten half of my husband's burger, which was quite tasty =). In my opinion, dishes like their delicious coconut chicken tenders or pizzas, are far better choices for that setting. While the theater itself is definitely more suitable for a date, (thanks to the ambiance and seat arrangements), the bar is a fun place for bigger groups. So, if you're trying to encompass everything from dinner to drinks to a movie, all in one evening, in one place.. this is a great one stop shop!"}
{"text":"Want to sit in the movies and also eat while not being judge having a lot of food during?  This is the place to go.  I really enjoy going to Studio Movie Grill if I want to knock out dinner and a movie.  Why, let break it down.  Parking is pretty good as there is a parking deck for Epicenter, and you can have your ticket validated at the box office!  Don't forget to bring your ticket with you.  Even when there are events around the area and they try to charge you for parking, I just tell the person I'm going to watch a movie, so they give me my ticket to get validated.    The seating is amazing!  Okay, they aren't couches, but they are pretty comfy leather seats.  Also, what I really love about this place is that you can reserve your seats online before going in!  I'm a person who shows up early to movies to get the BEST seat in the center, but if I go to SMG, I never need to rush as I know there shouldn't be anyone else in my seat since I had reserved it!  It's AMAZING.  Also, you can always seem to find Groupon deals for this place, so I score amazing seats with great deals!  Holla!  The service is amazing as well.  Everyone is really pleasant when they help me.  And inside the theater, OMG!!!  When you are sitting in your seat, there are buttons for you to inform a server that you need something.  You don't have to walk out during the movie!!!  This option is great for me as I never even want to get up to use the restroom for fear of missing something important during the movie.  Is it convenient...or just making me lazy...?  I'll just go with convenient.    The food is pretty good as well.  If you there are going to be two in your party, they have a 2 for $25 deal.  They change their menu every now and then, so always check out the options that are available.  They also serve drinks in here!  If you get dragged to go watch a movie that you aren't really feeling but you want to support your significant other, you can still drink and get a buzz.  It might make you get super excited for the movie!  Definitely check this place out, even if it's just once cause it's a pretty cool experience in my opinion."}
{"text":"I had a very relaxing time here.  The food was good bar type food and the service was fast.  I expected a lot of annoying sounds, but the staff was very quiet serving food.   The seats were very comfortable as well.  The pricing was reasonable for such a place.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Studio Movie Grill to see The Raven and really enjoy this place.  For one there is plenty of parking and usually plenty of seating in the theaters.  I do admit that the prices are a little steep, but again we are at the movies when have you ever had a deal unless you go to the dollar theater. The ticket prices are very similar to a regular theater and they seem to be on Groupon frequently so watch out for those that will help make up for the increased food prices :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to Studio Movie Grill for a few years. I will not be going back. The restroom was really awful. Not attended to at all. Two of the sinks didn't work and both the paper towel dispensers were broken. The theater wasn't very clean either. The seats have been changed so you have less room and have to share an armrest. Parents brought their 2 year old to a 9:00 PM PG-13 movie and let her run around the theater. She screamed and cried. The manager, Anthony, asked them to leave. One parent took her outside for maybe 2 minutes,  then brought her back in. I talked to Anthony after the movie about the state of the restrooms and the child that essentially ruined the movie. All he said was \"what would you like me to do\" and gave me serious attitude.  Save your $10 and go somewhere else!!!!"}
{"text":"Watching Unbroken. Theater is really big, lots of seating. Ordering food is convenient but very pricey. Wednesday's and Sundays have unlimited pizza for $10 which is a good deal."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the staff was very friendly BUT if you plan on catching a buzz before your movie, do it at the house! The drinks were expensive and i couldnt even taste any boose. Also my pesto chicken pizza was discusting but my roomate got a grilled cheese and sweet potato fries that were great. So stick with munchies type food and bring a flask! Well return for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times,  I've seen first run movies and had pretty good food.  Nice option for the dinner and a movie experience:  *Service  - Wait staff can be slow at times, but the staff is always friendly and polite.  It's great to pick your seat before the show, but every seat has a good view of screen.    *Atmosphere - The sound is clear.  They've got a full bar in the waiting area, if you'd like to get your party started before going in.  The dress is neat casual. The décor is modern and trendy with movie memorabilia.  There are a lot of couples but there are also groups of friends too.  The bathrooms are always very clean, and my understanding is that there are \"attendants\" in the men's room.  I guess dudes need special help with their bodily functions.     *Food - Everything I've had was served at optimal temperatures and was okay, not great, but they do have fairly \"exotic\" fare (for a movie theater) such as coconut chicken (which is nice).          Huge salads if you're into that. My nephew had the pizza and it looked like cardboard with cheese.  It tasted like frozen pizza.  So don't get the pizza!           Also the drinks with alcohol are quite watered down, so if you get an \"adult\" beverage stick to beer unless you want to pay for ice and food coloring.          I've never had the desserts, but the selection is considerable.          Its rather nice to eat out of real dishes and flatware while enjoying a movie.   *Cost - About average.  Unless you add alcohol,  then your tab will skyrocket!  Buy your tickets on-line for more convenience and savings (shout out to Groupon). ***Parking: They validate your parking.  So DON'T forget to bring that in or end up paying about $7-$12 for parking too."}
{"text":"My wife took the family and I here for my birthday today. We took advantage of the two for $25 offer. The movie price was cheaper than a regular movie theater. We really enjoy it and was completely amazed by the food. It was like going to an expensive restaurant. It was a 9 to 10. Everything was great and would especially recommend the chicken nachos. If you like this sort of thing I would really recommend."}
{"text":"We came in for a late night movie 10:45 and had one of the worst movie going experiences . This place is advertised as a luxury movie theater , but was far from it , at least for my visit . Walked into the theater and our seats and trays were dirty and sticky , thankfully I had something to wipe it off with . The seats next to us were even more disgusting.  During the movie I wanted to order some snacks , I pressed my button and waited , but nothing . I pressed a couple other times , still nothing . I was into my movie and didn't want to interrupt it by going to get someone or be the jerk flagging someone down . If buttons were down I'd like to know or if service had ended it would of been appreciated to get that info . Even if it's a late night movie , I expect certain standards to still be met . The actual movie was good,  picture and  sounded just fine . I just expected more from service and the facility . If there is a next time,  I hope the experience is better ."}
{"text":"Service is really terrible. If you want to get service you have to push every button on the whole row. I only come back here because I love the coconut chicken."}
{"text":"Chicken sliders have gone down hill this month and that was the only thing edible on the menu. Quality of chicken went down over the past month. Too bad because I used to look forward to them.    Update! Chicken sliders are back to normal! Yay! Thank you Studio Movie Grill."}
{"text":"Food is alright, not great.  Service a little better.  Seats are comfy and concept is cool.  Worth it if you don't wanna pay the price for other dine in movies.  The last time we went, we hadn't gotten our food and it was already about half way through the movie.  The place was packed so I wasn't concerned but my 4 year old was complaining, so I figured I'd ask.  They were very nice about it, and I wasn't even looking for anything more than just to get my food soon, but they comped our meal so that was great."}
{"text":"Went to see Black Panther last night and could not enjoy the movie and here are the reasons why 1. Movie started late 2. No bartender at the bar so we couldn't get a drink 3. Didn't have anything on the menu completely out of everything 4.It took 30 min. To take our order 5. Mid movie still no food 6. Almost the end of the movie still no food no drink ask to see someone 7. No one comes 8. The end of movie NO FOOD NO DRINK NO ONE CAME TO SEE ABOUT OUR SITUATION NO APOLOGY !!!!! it's alot more that happened this is just is just the low of the low points. I own a service based business and this kind of customer service would not be tolerated SMG needs to get it together and have better communication with in it's self and with it's  customers."}
{"text":"Well, we had a groupon coupon for the theater so we decided to check it out. The staff up front was exceptional. We thought we were going someplace special. The food was actually pretty good. The reason for the two stars is this:  The theater looks like a lecture hall from college. The seats are made up of desk chairs and stiff armchairs. The theaters are also pretty chilly as well. If this is supposed to be a new movie going experience then they need to bring in recliners with blankets. LOSE THE DESK CHAIRS! It looks tacky. Also the food service was good but they never check up on you. I know it's a movie playing but they should check in at least once. At this point, I'd say save the money and go to IPic."}
{"text":"I had 4 Groupons which were expiring in 1 day, so a double feature was in order.  The ticketing area and front lobby are nice, clean, and sleekly modern.  The young lady at the ticket counter was nice and patient as I tried to coordinate end times for one movie with the begin times for the next. I also like that I was able to guarantee my favorite movie theatre spot, thanks to their assigned seating.   The first movie auditorium was nicely set up and had a comfortable temperature. I didn't have to pull out my jacket, which is rare. The waiters bringing food, etc, were barely noticeable.  The 2nd auditorium was bigger, it was cold, and the waiter/staff running the orders were wildly annoying.  No attempts to duck or move quickly through the aisles, and some of them would stand right in front of you, entirely blocking your view. Others were epically failing at trying to whisper while discussing orders/mistakes, etc with neighboring patrons. Also, the set up... I don't know the proper term for when rows are staggered (the next row up being slightly higher), but someone got the equation wrong when building this auditorium. The head of the person sitting in the row in front of me kept blocking my view of the screen, so I kept having to tilt one way or another (of course, that head wouldn't stay still), or I'd just have a blind-spot during parts of the movie.   Lastly, I just so happened to pick two LOTR-length movies, so 6 hours later I could feel how uncomfortable the seats were.   We didn't get to try their menu during our visit, so I can't comment on their food at this time.   Can't say I won't return (I'm a sucker for a Groupon deal), but I have better options, be it dine-in or standard movie-going."}
{"text":"My mom and I visited this theater over the weekend to see Breaking Dawn and with the two free movie passes I found online, I couldn't pass up the deal.  Our theater was mostly empty which was nice and we ordered once we sat down.  I got the chicken tenders and a sweet tea and my mom ordered a grilled cheese.  We both got our food before the movie started, so within 5-10 mins, and mine wasn't even warm.  It was maybe lukewarm at best.  The sweet tea was too sweet and I received marinara sauce with my chicken strips instead of honey mustard.  I agree with what someone else said about the waiters being distracting running in front of the screen.  Luckily there was no one in front of us so it wasn't as much of a distraction but I can see how it would be.  The back row of seats are semi nice chairs with little tables but the front rows are merely swivel office chairs that they placed in there. Kind of tacky.  Don't know if I'd go back besides for the free coupons."}
{"text":"We typically love attending movies at SMG. Tickets are reasonable, especially when you get tickets on Groupon. Food is decent and is comparable in price to a normal restaurant. The experience of eating a good meal while watching movie is fun.   This last visit was bad, though. Hopefully not indicative of the way service is now performed. Waitress couldn't answer basic menu questions, making excuse that she \"hadn't worked a shift in like, a month.\" Food was a little to slow to come out, but fortunately we had a movie to watch. :-) Service during movie was baaaad though. Pushed button for service for a drink refill. Took 8-10 minutes for someone to come. 15 minutes later still hadn't brought the drink! Pushed button again (again, waited 8-10 minutes). Server apologized, stating that they were slammed. Took another 8-10 minutes for her to come back to with the drink. Seriously, 45 minutes to get a refill?  I accidentally left my credit card at the theater. Called the theater and was unable to speak to anyone. Ended up having to leave a message for the manager, though I was assured (ha ha) that the management checks messages frequently throughout the day. They never called me. Ended up swinging by about 18 hours later to get the card. If you're running a business, you need to make it easier for your customers to get a hold of you by phone!  I'll give SMG another try in the future because we have had better experiences in the past. Hopefully this was just an anomaly."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here and I think the experience was pretty wonderful. I felt a little weird at first because I had to have someone wait on me hand and foot at the theatre but I guess that's supposed to be the perk of this place. I have to admit it was pretty nice to be able to have someone bring your food and drinks to you and not miss the movie. The facilities were clean, staff friendly... Just would have been nice if the seats reclined it's hard to get comfortable in a leather seat sitting completely upright."}
{"text":"We went to the Studio Movie Grill to support a fundraiser for the Carolina Theatre.  The featured film was \"Night At The Opera\" starring The Marx Brothers. I met my friends at the bar, where we enjoyed cheerful, engaging service.  I had a glass of Hayes Ranch Chardonnay (nice pour, by the way)!  Two of my friends had Woody and Wilcox beer, and another friend got the vodka special. When we went into the theatre, the server responded immediately to our request for service.  My friend and I got the $25.00 special, which was an appetizer and two entrees.  We got the cheese fries, which came with some kind of dipping sauce.  All of the cheese, which was reminiscent of food court nacho cheese, was at the bottom of the bowl.  My friend then had a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Although it was challenging to see in the dark, he feared that the chicken was underdone.  I got the thin crust margarita pizza.  If that was thin crust, the regular crusts must have been thick as concrete blocks.  The pizza also tasted like it was frozen, but not as good as Digiorno.  However, when I reheated  the leftovers the next day, it tasted better.  Perhaps the flavors needed to meld. I really didn't expect gourmet food at a movie theatre.  I think that it is really nice that we have a place to go where we can have more than popcorn and soda as we enjoy a show.  Thank you, Studio Movie Grill, for supporting this fundraiser."}
{"text":"Very convenient online ticketing purchase process. Lobby and hallways very clean and well-kept. However, staff was very absent-minded. My dish came out wrong, which was fine, but after asking for it to be corrected was forgotten about several times and the request button had to be pushed six times (each time a different staff member responding) over the duration of an hour before the dish was finally returned to me.  Overall, a good place to go if staff was more competent."}
{"text":"It continues to be the same. The last time I came here I order cheeseburger for my kids and it came out hard and bun was about 4x as big as the burger patty. So I send them back. They remade the burger and it came out exactly the same. Then I get the bill and I was charged for 2 burgers. Ugh. Then this time we decided to return and we ate before we came because we knew how the food would turn out. I did order a dessert and order the 3 scoop ice cream sundae for my three girls to share and asked if they could put one scoop into three separate bowls, the waiter said yes that would be fine. He then returned and said they couldn't do that. It doesn't seem like they are into customer service. This seems like an easy task and they were unable to fulfill. I recently went to Roadhouse cinema and it just reassures me that there is a nicer place. The food was extremely good and service was great. Don't think I'll be return to SMG unless forced. Sorry for the bad review but there are so many better places to go. FYI cellular service does work in the building so you can't even use the Groupon that I purchased. Ask the manager to help and she said nothing I can do. Another woman in the lobby trying to use living social coupon and she couldn't get on wifi or cellular Sevice either. Jokes on us."}
{"text":"Disappointing evening due to poor view. I rarely go to the movies but the one time I do my family and I reserved VIP seats and we're stuck watching the back of people's heads. Poor design for a theater. Please fix this and I might come back. Wasted my money and ruined a very special night for us."}
{"text":"Neat concept, but the deceptive Monday Daily Special cost them 2 stars and 2 customers. Let me explain: They have daily specials and Mondays is \"Margarita Mondays\", meaning half off all house Margs. Well, they come as a glass for $8 or a Pitcher for $26. A Half Priced Pitcher seemed like a 'no brainer' to me and I expressed my delight of this option to the server when I ordered it. Since nothing was said during ordering about the pitcher not being an available half price option at the time, I assumed everything was OK. That was until the bill arrived and I noticed it was full price. Pointing this out to the server, he scurried off to \"fix\" it, only to return minutes later to say he could not and had already talked to the manager. Then he asked if I would like something else instead to make up for the fact that they were falsely advertising what the special included. I didn't quite get what he meant, but it gave me the impression that I was not the first to point out this deception.  Needless to say, I wont be returning to blow $50 on a movie again."}
{"text":"Went to this movie theater last night to watch Think Like A Man 2.  Not only was the movie mediocre but so was the service I received at the bar. The bartenders are extremely inattentive. When I first walked up to the bar, no one greeted me and I had to wait about 5 min and finally I spoke up and asked for service. TWICE. The second time I went back was because my drink was terrible. I got no apology, no one seemed like they wanted to help me until I spoke up and asked for some attention. The girl that had originally served me was to busy counting money and putting away glasses to even acknowledge me. Or so I thought, because someone she knew walked up and she got them a drink right away.  I am a person who believes in tipping well for great customer service and that bar is not worthy. They have no courtesy about their service and I will NEVER go back to this location."}
{"text":"There is room for improvement here, bottom line. While they do not offer blankets and pillows like iPic, they don't seem to intend to or want to but I think it'd be a nice touch. Their staff generally seem professional and informative, while their food is very good.  I am only knocking a star due to prices and service attention. With a military discount I believe their prices are very good in terms of tickets. Their seating is very comfortable in my opinion, but the customer service can speed up a tiny bit. We waited maybe 10-15 minutes for a free refill on coffee, and it didn't seem to be too busy. Their food is a little overpriced if you ask me, but absolutely delicious.   You could argue that these are expected Scottsdale prices, but if I had to choose another reason to knock off a star it would be that they leave their broken/damaged seats directly outside of the building. I would find another place if possible or come up with some method to put a few in the dumpster once in a while, as it looks pretty out of place out there. I didn't expect that in good ol' Snobbsdale."}
{"text":"I wished the had reclined seats. Although the ambiance of the place is dark and beautiful.although service with food has some issues but the movie itself is picture is good."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!The worst customer service and manager Anthony Enriquez EVER.  We purchased a groupon and arrived on Sunday at 6pm to find out the groupon wasn't valid.  We asked for the manager Anthony Enriquez and he was nothing but rude and condescending to my husband and I.  Then after he offered nothing and said \"see yah have a good night\" he told us to go to the back of the line again to pay for tickets we already purchased online.  I told him I wasn't standing in the line again and he told us to leave.  I have never experienced such poor customer service and disrespect in my life.  We are following up with corporate to make sure Anthony Enriquez finds another place of employment."}
{"text":"If zero stars was an option, I would have given them that.  Actually.... The staff was friendly so they get 1 star for that. Please read on as I may save you from making the $150 mistake I made.  That's right, $150.  Our tickets were $35 (me, wife, my 16 yr old student, and my 10 yr old).  Food was around  $115 with tip.    Like so many other reviewers, I say this concept is a great idea and would live up to expectations with better management of the operation.  But let's not bore you too quickly.  Here are the bullets.  - the food is simply horrible.  My niece could make better pizza in her EZ Bake oven!   - some of the food was delivered cold - the pizza and the chicken nachos.  But, who dares to complain when your food is being served in almost complete darkness.  So, I wrote a note on the bill when I paid. - the \"theater popcorn\" was mostly kernels.  I really wanted to take a picture as it was quite amusing to see how many unpopped kernels there were.  Almost like it was a joke. - the gluten free crust was cardboard I think.  Other reviewers have also complained about the regular crust.  - the seats we reserved online were incorrectly described.  We selected 2 seats with one long table with recliners on each side that had their own table. What we got were 4 recliners with individual tables. - bucket of beers (5) was $20 and were proper temp.  Best part of the food/drink experience  My suggestion for the readers if you have not gone... 1. Parking is a breeze and free. Remember to bring your ticket to get validated at SMG. 2.  Do not order the food! 3. In case you missed #2, DO NOT ORDER THE FOOD! 4. Eat before hand at one of the many restaurants in the Epicentre and let SMG pick up your parking as a part of the movie (they give you 4 hours).  5. Pick your seats online - it's worth the extra $1.50 per seat in my opinion. 6. Forget everything I said here... Go out to eat at one of your preferred restaurants and then go to Ayrseley Cinemas.  Much better use of your money and a fantastic place to see a movie."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best way to watch a movie.  Brilliant.  I recommend the chicken nachos.  we watch movies here all the time and have never had a bad experience.  With the groupons that are always running it is only $5 or $6 for a ticket, and you can go anytime.  A Friday night movie with a beer for $10?  This place rocks."}
{"text":"Went to studio movie grill to watch IT and had an hour to burn so we ate at the bar. The bartender was nice and made a good blackberry bourbon drink. We shared the pretzel bites with cheese sauce. The pretzels were cold and had so much butter on them,  the cheese wouldn't adhere. My girlfriend ordered the blackened chicken pasta, which was basically mac and cheese with chicken. It wasn't great but I'm not hating on it. I had the chimichurri steak salad. It came with ranch dressing, and the chimichurri sauce was basically a green paste that's lumped into the mix of greenery. The steak was cold and dry, like some refrigerated jerky. I couldn't eat it so I sent it back, the lady was nice enough to let me trade it for a burger and fries. The fries were fresh and hot, the absolute pinnacle of my meal this evening. The burger patty was cold and dry, just like the steak. I took 2 bites and left the rest.  I can imagine that the meats are all cooked at the beginning of the day and left to sit until they're sold. I'll return one day, but only to watch a movie. I've learned my lesson to come here on a full stomach"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy coming here, however, we bought tickets a month in advance and when we get to our seats (auditorium #4 in the back row) we have the pleasure of looking at the back of someone's head. The auditorium is poorly built considering I've been in others and haven't had the issue. The icing on the cake is we don't get refunded the service charge that we paid because the tickets were purchased online. Drive an hour and a half round trip for nothing. Real disappointment at this location."}
{"text":"James is a great server, so happy to have a had a great experience once again.  Thank you James.   By The Way, don't tell my trainer CJ but the meat pizza is soooo totally with the 2 hours on treadmill tomorrow:)"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here.  I may be a bit biased becase I didn't pay for anything so not sure how the prices are.  The service was great, there was no line to get in and we had great seats.  I love how you just push the button to get service- restaurants should do this.  I don't have anything to complain about this place.  It was great."}
{"text":"Uuuugh. Went here with my book club. We wanted to ensure we got seats together so we booked online. Turns out tickets are a buck fifty more online than in the theatre. Not cool. The movie and dining experience is weird and interruptive. The food is total garbage and way overpriced. The drinks were OK. The waiter came to deliver the bill right at the exciting end of the move and stood in front of us so we missed it! So bad. Wouldn't go back or recommend."}
{"text":"We came last weekend and I ordered the chicken Siracusa sliders with fries. The food was amazing and fresh however today I ordered the same and it was disgusting the sliders were extremely salty and very different from the ones I had last weekend the fries were old and burned my husband ordered a pizza and they brought him the wrong kind it was a huge disappointment I will make sure to eat somewhere else before the movie if I ever want to come back."}
{"text":"Uptown is back to having a movie theater once again.  While I was fear for my wallet, I was pleasantly surprised by the ticket prices.  $10 adult, $7.50 matinee /student.  Ladies night on Tuesdays for $5. Wow... I don't have to sell my organ to watch a movie?    Melissa and I went on a Monday to see the new Oz movie. 7pm showing. We ran into a slight problem when we were being led to our seats.  Something about the actual seat #s and the #s on the ticket don't match. I hope they fix it by now, because I was not too happy missing my previews while the usher/waiter trying to figure out where to put us.  Monday night came with half price margaritas special, frozen or on the rock.  It came in a big tall pint glass.  It was so much better than any icee or soda. I literally felt like a kid for a split second when the waiter put down my drink on my little table. I held it with both my hands (no spilling!) and took a good gulp of it.  Fabulous!  We ordered a chicken quesadilla to split. It came with a side so I picked chips and salsa. It's plenty to keep both of us happy. Melissa got to press the red button to call for service. While at first it was odd looking at waiters running around in the dark in front of the screen, I got used to it pretty easily.   Only complaint was the crying baby.  Obviously not the theater's fault, but seriously who bring a crying baby to a movie and stayed the entire time the baby was crying?  People are so inconsiderate.   Overall thumbs up. And oh I think they have special showings for $1 (ex. Magic Mike the other Wednesday)."}
{"text":"If I were only reviewing the food I would give it one star. The second star is purely there for the fact that we didn't go only for the food. The service was awful. I really understand that it's a big load to have to feed and deliver all of the food to a whole theater, but they are either short staffed or don't have a great system going. Only one of us between the two of us (my husband and myself) were served water, and when we lit up our buttons to get more, the staff they forgot to bring it out. 10 minutes after lighting up our button for a second time, we finally get a refill on the one cup of water we had.   Both of us had cold French fries. My burger meat was rubbery and I don't even know if what I ate on it was actually guacamole or not because it didn't taste like anything.   The staff was polite, but definitely frantic and I just can't justify going to a place like that when I could get a much more satisfying dinner elsewhere before my movie.   Save your money for a nice dinner and a theater with reclining seats."}
{"text":"I really like all the renovations the theatre has made since making the transition to SMG.   The seats throughout the theatre are amazingly comfortable and very spacious. I would forgo the food a stick to the drinks. They have specials almost everyday and make the drink to your liking.   It's well worth the $10 to see a good movie, have a good drink, and a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"First of all, I don't understand why it's such a big deal for everyone to complain about this place. All movie theaters have quirks and terrible things you wish didn't happen. If it's comfort you're seeking , then stay home and rent a movie!  I went to see Safe House this weekend on 2/11 for the 10:30 showing. I showed up about 30 minutes before the movie and got perfect seating right in the middle. I actually liked the tables with the office chairs! :) It provided much more room than the leather seats with the small fold out tables.   This is a new company here and granted the execution isn't so great, but what do you expect for a seven dollar price? If you want the best experience out there for a cheap price, it doesn't exist. It's going to cost you $20-$40 for the Ipic Theater in Scottsdale.   The facility was clean and neat. The lobby has seating and the lounge/bar area also has bistro tables with seating too.   The food is limited. There are salads, chicken tenders, burgers, popcorn, quesadillas, sweet potato fries, kid meals etc. Don't expect a fancy meal. I loved their Hawaiian Martini. Tastiest thing on the drink menu!   The place is like a dinner theater, the same if you were to go to murder mystery inc. You order, they serve you and you watch the show. I enjoyed my experience here. It was charming, sweet, and the servers were willing to help you the best way they could have.   Other than the weird seating arrangements in the theater, I think overall, the quality of the service and the atmosphere was good. It's an experience to try."}
{"text":"Food is way overpriced and terrible.  We've tried the food at this establishment 3 times. No more chances for you SMG   The first time we ordered chicken fingers & fries the chicken fingers were cold and the fries were hot. The next time we ordered food again and we figured \"lets give it another chance\" maybe they changed their cook, but we had the same experience again, the chicken was not cook all the way and it was cold in the middle.   Their pizzas taste like the old party pizzas I used to eat as a kid that cost 99cents but this one costs $11  Don't waste your money! eat somewhere else before you come.  The last time we were there we decided to watch Transformers which always has great special effects and sound. The sound in the theater (theater #5)was terrible there was a speaker that was damaged and it was rattling the whole movie totally ruined the movie  So if you only want to see a drama where quality sound does not matter and only want to drink I guess it would be OK."}
{"text":"Fun outing in uptown.  I ve gone to this movie theater several times and it is a nice escape in Uptown.   Try and get your tickets through groupon/livingsocial.  They validate parking, so you can park for free in the epicenter lot.     They also serve food and drinks at the theater.  You sit down in the theater and press a button and a server will come to you to take your order.   The food is good, but a bit pricey, ( I assume this is were their profits mainly come from).   The one things that detracts from the experience is the servers are around the theater, which is distracting, but after going a couple times I have become use to it."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre but edible.  The carpets outside the theaters are beyond disgusting and in dire need of cleaning and/or replacement.  The restrooms are always in bad shape.  Wet floors, broken urinals, and my favorite that wonderful stall urine smell which is awesome when you can smell it next to where the food is staged.  Some staff are friendly but the lion share have a look of sheer disgust on their faces."}
{"text":"It's a great concept and location - smack dab in the middle of uptown. They also validate your parking for up to 4 hours @ the Epicentre which is great, as parking there is usually expensive. However, I paid extra to reserve my seat online but people were sitting in our seats when we arrived. We had to awkwardly kick them out and feel like assholes - an no one wants to pay extra to have to do that. The food was very meh. Think over-priced, frozen/fried bar food. All very bland. We got some disgusting spinach dip, a chicken sandwich and chicken flat bread pizza. Supposed to be a 2 for $25 deal but somehow the bill was $50. They bring your check while the movie is still going on so we just bit the bullet and paid it. Have had stomach issues since eating there (3 days). If you go I would suggest sticking with beer and a safe bet like popcorn."}
{"text":"As much as I want to give them a 2 or 3 for the concept, some of the good food, or the fact that they validate parking in the expensive Epicentre parking lot I just can't. I've been here on numerous occasions and every time its something. On my last visit, it was me and 9 of my friends. The first thing we noticed was that the theater was dirty! We were trying to find seats together of course (it was an advance screening so not assigned beforehand) and when I say every other seat was just about filthy with spills, trash and crumbles all on the chairs, trays, and floors. Luckily we did find two decent rows and were able to wave down a server to clean the mess that was there. Once seated we all ordered and half the food came out cold, not lukewarm but cold. One ordered tenders and fries, her tenders were right out the fryer hot and the fries might as well came out of the freezer they were so cold.  One of my go to items here are the chicken nachos so a few ordered that and every single one came out cold, with one order not coming out until the middle of the movie and we all ordered at the same time. I ordered the buffalo chicken flatbread which is really good and it did come out hot. The servers were all over the place and it was always a new one that had an attitude when there was an issue. They are also kind of a distraction all throughout the movie and you could tell that there were a lot of issues all throughout the theatre and not just with my group. And their go to excuse is that the kitchen is backed up but that can't be the case every single time and if it is then they need more staff or a better system.  Another issue is the check process, maybe they need to confirm everything is correct before bringing the checks because there was a long line after the movie with all the people trying to get their checks fixed, a few of my friends included."}
{"text":"Dirty, Dirty, Dirty....the bathrooms at the Scottsdale SMG for YEARS are foul.....tampons dispensers broken and on the ground for WEEKS, no toliet paper, broken sinks, no soap in dispensers and a distinct SEWAR smell as soon as you enter the front lobby for YEARS.  Tonight....there was crusty food smeared on the door handles and crusty vomit in the theater walkway in Theater 4.  I see the same old tired, grey haired manager running around........but clearly not delegating.  So gross....will only go to  IPIC and AMC Desert Ridge from now on."}
{"text":"Groupon deal was well worth it. Different movie experience and very enjoyable. The food was okay."}
{"text":"AWFUL! This place is packed! If you want to get into a movie you have to show up at least an hour and a half before. The seating is awful, bench table with office chairs. The food is EXPENSIVE and disgusting. If you want  a great movie dine in experience go to the AMC Esplanade."}
{"text":"Really cool concept for dinner and a movie. Potato skin app was really good, and the salad was decent. I wasn't impressed with the ice cream sandwich dessert. Also misleading on who you're tipping when you have 5 plus servers working together on a dinner party of two. I would go back another time and recommend people try atleast once!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite theater in Charlotte but the experience has gone down hill over the past couple of years. The food is still pretty good and the service has become hit or miss. The billiards area has not been well maintained and the restrooms have been a disaster lately.   I probably won't go back for a while."}
{"text":"I rarely go to the movies, so it's always a big treat when I do. I had heard about movies where they serve food and DRINKS, but I hadn't been to one before. When Beauty and the Beast came out, I decided I had to try it. I am giving my experience a 4-star review because I had a blast and loved the movie. I thought the seats were comfortable, and contrary to other posts, I didn't notice people walking by. I was actually surprised to see my friend had a drink and the bill and didn't even notice how it got there. It was also $8 for a matinee ticket, and coming from NYC, that is a great price!  The reason this may not be a fair review is that I didn't order food. I tried to order a mojito, but during the film, someone came by and told me they didn't have mint. It was hard to understand, but that's what I think he said. Needless to say, I didn't get my drink. It was frustrating, but it didn't ruin the experience."}
{"text":"Every time I come to studio movie grill, I have the worst service you could possibly imagine.  Great seating and movie theater experience, good sound, average \"bar pricing\" for food and drinks but...  Excruciatingly long wait times for drinks and food.  When paying half cash and half debit.... servers keeping the money to themselves and charging the full amount of the bill.... to the debit card.   Bad experience. Every. Single. Time.  This place needs better management and employees.  Look for alternatives."}
{"text":"I was originally going to give my update a lower star rating but my experience last night allowed me to maintain this 5 star review.   We came to SMG when Spectre first opened up and ordered our favorite Sriracha chicken flatbread because the coconut sauce that comes with it is just out of this world. Sadly, our flatbread didn't come with any this time. I was disappointed but took this experience as a learning experience, I thought I'd make sure to ask for extra sauce next time. Last night, we returned to watch a screening of The Big Short and were even further disappointed with the serving staff. I specifically asked for extra coconut sauce when ordering our food ( it was even printed on the food ticket). After receiving a mediocre chicken nachos which were extremely hard to eat in the awkward bowl it was served in, our entrees never came while everyone else was chowing down. Finally, a server came up to me to explain how they lost my original order, someone else had picked it up in the kitchen and they are expediting my order. Again, I also asked for extra coconut sauce from the server and she assured me that it will be brought. Surprise! No sauce on our dry Sriracha flatbread! I didn't even eat the flatbread, I left it to show the manager.   The GM, Chris, was already pretty swapped with getting in all the checks after the movie so I waited till everyone left. I explained the situation, Chris ended up comping our food and gave us movie passes to make up for the last couple of experiences with the kitchen. Thanks for rectifying the situation Chris, we will for sure be returning to Studio Movie Grill. I still, however, will not let up regarding the coconut sauce, I want my coconut sauce!"}
{"text":"This place is the high water mark for watching a movie and having a great meal. The costs are very reasonable, the seats amazingly comfortable, and the food is spectacular. We travel all the way from the west side to come watch a movie here. The service is always top notch and the servers are friendly. I strongly recommend this place for a great dinner and movie experience."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite movie theater.   We head here Atleast once a week as a group of 6 and it's always a good time.   Food is great, drinks; although a bit pricey (if not on happy hour), always made well and Come on, watching a new movie while eating a burger and well drink- can't ask for more.   Also always a groupon for a $5 ticket!!  5 STARS Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible!!! I posted photos of our \"seats\"!!! We sat at a counter in desk chairs... And not even comfortable ones!!! I went back to the counter and she said all of the \"seats\" we sold out. I paid $22.00 for this and drove over 30 miles each way! I asked her why they didn't tell us about these seats on the website when we bought them... She said there is a legend on the bottom of the page. Good to know... Now!!! We will never go back ... And we will tell everyone to stay away. Funny thing is, at the bar the bartender told us the Camelback Esplanade wishes they were like Studio Movie Grill... I am still laughing... What a dump!"}
{"text":"I love the convenience of this theatre. The food is a little pricey, but they validate parking and the seats are super comfy. Groupon is always the best with $5 tickets for SMG!"}
{"text":"This place has seriously gone down hill... first off it's filthy, service is terrible, staff is rude, really I understand sticky floors in a movie theater, but this is a restaurant... Place has been in decline for awhile now but I was shocked tonight. Food is mediocre at best... simple statement is that microwave popcorn is superior to that mushy butter flavored \"popcorn\" they sell. And the cherry on top tonight was the movie started 25mins late... no apology, no justifiable reason, they just forgot, someone had ask the staff to start the movie..."}
{"text":"So our movie didn't start after we had already ordered food! Well.... I couldn't have been a better experience! We swapped movies they comped us and we got a free ticket! There will be 'fails' in a business any business but how you deal with them is the key to success. The food was all terrific and the beers cold! Come here with confidence"}
{"text":"They have a great idea, but the execution just isn't there.   Took the parental units to see Man of Steel today. The theater was clean.. sound loud, drinks cold, yet beer warm.. however the food was COLD.  Had they been served warm/hot the Tucson pizza and the Korean beef taco's may have been good. The seasoned fries were just OK.   Man the movie was great! The seats were comfy and the crowd silent. So very nice.   Upon leaving.. we had to make a potty stop... man was the that bathroom disgusting! No TP, sticky floors/stalls, broken/clogged sinks, just plain gross.   Will I go again.. yeah prob so since I have the Groupons.. but will order carefully and remember to bring my own TP and toilet seat covers.   Oh, forgot to ask if they validate... $10 was a lot."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The menus are sticky, and the seats and trays are filthy. The movie wasn't projected onto the screen properly (it came in at an odd angle and didn't cover the corners of the screen), but who cares, you can't pay attention to what's on the screen with people talking throughout the film.  The food is terrible and not worth your money. My sliders came out cold and tasted awful. Also, no soda or beer on tap because who the hell knows.  I ordered a bottled beer and got the wrong order twice. The server also forgot to bring out items we did order, and then charged us for them.  Studio Movie Grill is a dump run by people who don't care about your movie going or dining experience."}
{"text":"Studio Movie Grill is a restaurant and a movie theater all in one. Two styles of seating to choose from, desk with office style chairs or leather chairs with swivel tables. Both are quite comfortable.  Each chair has push button to call for service. I'd recommend getting there little early before the start of the movie to order food as it gets difficult and disruptive once movie starts.  The food is hit or miss. I'd recommend the coconut chicken; it's always a good choice. Their strawberry lemonade is also delicious and it comes with free refills.  Service is top notch. Just remember Tuesdays are $5 movies all day long. I'd recommend at least one visit to see if dinner/lunch with your movie is your thing. If not, you can skip the meal and just get popcorn and drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to other movie theaters that serve dinner but this place really doesn't know how to properly execute this. We went last night to watch Star Wars. We arrived early to ensure we can order food prior to the movie starting but no... we didn't see any waiters until the movie started. A good 1/2 hour into the movie and people all around us are ordering food. We couldn't pay attention to the movie.   When our waitress finally arrives, she informs us that there was a kitchen fire the previous night, and most of their food cannot be ordered. Really? Why am I just hearing of this? A great leadership team would have ensured that all employees communicated this information to customers. I went through two employees before reaching our waitress. We order hamburgers instead, since the oven was lost to a kitchen fire but no.... They were also sold out of buns.  I order a drink to only be told I must choose another one. All around me waiters and waitresses are apologizing. Why would any management team put their employees through that? Complete morale killer for the staff.    Just when I though things couldn't get any worse... here comes out the food. My husband and I ordered the coconut chicken tenders. Mine had the Thai chilli sauce and his had the honey mustard. My husband asked the runner which sauce was this? She didn't know. She then became irate and threw the food down, told us she wasn't the cook and continued to walk away. The rudeness! Her running partner saw what happened and immediately apologized. He then took the food away and placed it in another section. It wasn't our food to begin with but miss attitude walked away before she could determine that.   Food finally arrives! Our $11 chicken was over fried, almost black and very hard. The $10 nachos were piled high with so many ingredients you could not see the nachos, making it very hard to use your hands. My $9 Pineapple Crush tasted horrible and watered down. My daughter was the only one who scored a great tasting Cesar salad.    If anyone rates this place with more than 2 stars they clearly have never been to a theater that is top notch in their game. Clearly they need a new management team."}
{"text":"It is slightly difficult to rate this place, because it has such a wide range of things to consider.  Movie Experience: In terms of the movie experience, it is great.  The ticket prices are very reasonable, and the seats are huge and comfortable.  Dining Experience: I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was!  For a movie theater, the food will most likely exceed expectations.  The Thai Chicken Pizza is great.  I also really liked the Coconut Chicken Tenders w/ fries.  The prices are a little high in my opinion, but not out of hand. (i.e. food at a Bobcats or Panthers game)   The main problem with SMG is the service.  This may improve with time, as the business is new, but the servers I have dealt with (for the most part) seem slightly 'out of sort'.  They have struggled to take orders accurately, and reflect the orders accurately on the check.  You may have to get used to the servers taking orders during the movie, but it is not that bad, as the movie is loud enough and they are fairly discrete (I cannot guarantee the same level of subtleness from other customers, though.)  Overall: I like SMG (mainly for the movie experience), and I will go back, I am just hoping for it to become a little better in terms of its food service operations.  Hopefully I can update this with another star in the future."}
{"text":"The movie experience has been thoroughly compromised. I loved this place because it was a great place to not run into mall-rat kids, annoying people kicking the back of your seat, all the good seats taken by people who camped out, etc etc, and to be able to watch a first rate movie in peace and comfort for a bit of a price premium. A full bar was icing on top of actually watching a movie in an experience that was as good as being at home.  The most crucial thing is these new anti-theft 3D glasses by Dolby are huge, uncomfortable, and most importantly very dirty and reflective (The individually wrapped Real-D ones were far better and CLEAN). After first putting a very dirty set back and grabbing a new pair they still were covered in prints, After a thorough scrubbing to try to get the obvious finger prints off of my vision I was left with a Vaseline covered goop around the corners of the screen and tunnel vision. The lights are kept fairly high so the servers can walk around, the problem is these reflective lenses gave me a very good view of my own eyeball and the lights to my periphery, further obscuring my vision of the movie. I felt like a fool but the only solution I found was to stick my movie ticket in-between the glasses and my temple creating a blinder that fixed one lens. When possible I took them off and ignored the blurry backgrounds. Double vision was better than a dim blurry mess.  Food and drink is great... but meaningless if the movie experience is ruined.  Servers have walk-e-talkys chirping during the movie taking you out of it, their ordering system seemed to be a glowing white smartphone. Why not install a red filter on them? The color red does not affect night vision nor distract near as much. Similarly, give them red flashlights and turn the lights back down to movie levels. They are good at ducking out of the way but that doesn't solve everything.  I won't review the food but I was dismayed to see the drink selection was no longer local microbrews like OMB Copper, but now a slew of major national names (and for some reason Sweetwater 420, yuck).  Sadly it looks like next time I will be back at a major chain with the mallrats. Or better yet, staying home and busting out my own growler of Copper."}
{"text":"My husband & I go here all the time. We enjoy the bar option before the movie, and the food is good. I get the coconut chicken & I love them! We definitely dont leave hungry. Service is awesome, very friendly & polite staff. They do there best to stay quite while the movie is playing. This place fills up fast so some times you have to go in ahead of time to reserve your seats. Definitely a great place for family or a date night."}
{"text":"If your looking to go see a cheap movie and get drinks then this is a cool place to go. The foods not the greatest but there aren't many dine in theaters in the valley that won't drain your wallet! The seats aren't the most comfortable but they have good daily drink specials and usually always have a groupon for tickets! Also if you have time to spare before the movie then I would recommend sitting at the bar and grabbing a drink and appetizer first! Eric was the bartender when I went and he was great!"}
{"text":"Movie was great!! I got the ribs, which I will not get again, they were way over cooked, I also got a drink from the bar, it was just ok, the theater was very nice, and modern, a great place to take a date. I'm sure I'll go back again"}
{"text":"This place is decked out to seem like a nice bar/night club but acts like a dollar theater. I have visited this theater 5+ times now, mostly due to the $5 groupon deal. The food is decent for a movie theater- stay away from the pizza and the 2/$25 \"deal\" where they gouge you with a tiny appetizer that definitely won't feed 2 people. Arrive early or buy tickets online to make sure you can pick the seats you want. I love that I can pick my seats in advance, I've never been stuck with a bad one.   The only reason I took off 2 stars is that this place is dirty and there is no customer service. The walls have grease spots, nothing above arm height has been dusted in years, the seats and cup holders always have crumbs or trash in them and the bathroom doors literally have paint peeling off of them. The staff is usually huddled together somewhere chatting, except the bartenders who have been great.   For $5 plus validated parking in the epicenter garage it's not a terrible trade off, I'll be going back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Love the concept of a dine-in theater! All of the employees who work here seem happy to be there; excellent customer service. Movie theater itself was very clean. Chairs were super comfy. Servers were on top of things. Food was great. Loved their specialty cocktails too! My new go-to theater in AZ!"}
{"text":"My second visit was great! Purchased the Groupon discount. Celebrated wedding anniversary with hubby watching 'San Andreas'. Service was great, food (coconut chicken tenders and sweet potato fries again) was excellent! Seats were very comfortable. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Unlike other dine-in theaters, Studio Movie Grill's tickets are affordable. I love to go on Sunday nights when their SMG Cellar wines (good!) are $5 per glass. They serve decent American fare - burgers, pizzas, salads, etc. For dessert, you really can't go wrong with a frozen hot chocolate - so gooood! You can also get popcorn & candies like at a regular theater. But, really, the reason I love this place is not for the quality of food, but for the cushy chairs and the experience. My kids love pushing the button to order...it's just a fun way to see a movie!"}
{"text":"I went to Studio Movie Grill on a somewhat regular basis when I lived in Texas. I think this is the only location in Phoenix, so I was willing to drive out pretty far to reminisce and eat while watching a movie.  There's studio seating, with lots of seats either bar style or table style. Visibility is pretty good even if people sit in front of you. The theater is nice and new and clean.  Service is fairly good. Food comes out quickly. It's expensive and not the best, but deals like unlimited pizza on Sundays (aka quantity) make up for shoddy food.  It's worth visiting at least once. As long as your expectations for food are reasonable  - and you aren't too off put by overpriced menus - it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"The main reasons I'm giving one star to SMG are the following-  1.) Mediocre food. The quality is on par with Applebee's or Chili's. I've had the shrimp and the flat bread pizza on previous visits and neither are anything to write home about. On this visit I only had dessert (warm chocolate chip cookies) and they were pretty average. Similar in taste to a warmed up \"Chips Ahoy\" cookie. Edible, but not \"delicious\" by any stretch of the imagination.  2.) The seats are not as comfortable as one would hope, nor do they recline at all. Also the tray table makes me feel like I'm in one of those tiny elementary school desks. It's not really a comfy eating experience.  3.) They stopped allowing the use of Groupons on weekends which is when MOST people go to the movies. I have purchased Groupons two or three times in the past few years and used them on Saturday nights without issue. When I attempted to use my most recent Groupon this Saturday, they refused to honor it. The policy \"changed\". I was NOT a happy camper and believe this definitely constitutes a bait & switch.  4.) On my most recent visit this weekend, they allowed a baby (looked to be between 7-10 months old) to accompany a parent into an R-rated movie after 8pm on a Saturday night and that baby squealed, cried, and screeched annoyingly pretty continuously throughout the entire film. It got especially cantankerous during the last 40 or so minutes of the movie.   I'll admit, I'm one of those snarky childless people who thinks kids should not be seen or heard anywhere ever, but especially NOT in an R-rated movie on \"date night\". And sadly, entitled parents these days prioritize their selfish desires and pleasures over the comfort of others in public spaces and said parents didn't have the courtesy or intelligence to TAKE THEIR CHILD OUT OF THE THEATER AT ANY POINT.  They sat there like oblivious imbeciles, shoving popcorn into their stupid mouths while their baby disrupted the movie.   Considering there were servers in the theater the entire time this was transpiring, this is a spectacular failure on behalf of SMG. The theater employees could have easily intervened and advised the parents to take their child out of the movie. This would have gained a higher review from me as well as my continued patronage. Instead the employees in the theater allowed this nonsense to continue for two hours and for me personally, it ruined the movie and my impression of this business. Very, very disappointing SMG.   Had I not been with a date and trying to be on my \"best behavior\" with a new guy I'm seeing, I would have complained to every employee in sight! But the larger point is, I should not HAVE to do that. No patron should- especially when employees are in the theater witnessing this debacle.   I don't plan on returning to SMG. There are too many better options in the valley- reclining seats, better food options, and the banning of children is commonplace at many of the theaters in town. I'll visit one of those rather than subject myself to the possibility of more tomfoolery at Studio Movie Grill."}
{"text":"Dinner and a movie? How about both!   The food is great, but it is very expensive. The convenience factor makes it worth some bump in price, but I think it could be a bit cheaper. The staff is very fast and unobtrusive once the film is shown.  I loved the seating and haven't had any problems with uncomfortable seats. I could understand problems with young kids staying seated.  Having said that, I think that the customers need to know that it is still best to stay quiet. Some folks seemed to feel that food and movie = talking allowed. They were quieted eventually by the staff and I appreciated that.  If you are skittish to try at first, give the matinee a go. Afraid you won't get a good seat? You can make reservations!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I've been going to the SMG for a long time now & just recently it has hit rock bottom with my expectations.  Over the last couple of weeks I have been to the movies at SMG 3 separate times and each time they seem to have gotten worse in appearance, customer service & quality.    For instance #1:  While watching the movie, our order came way later than others, who ordered after us.  The order came to us the wrong way we ordered it. And then we were questioned by the staff and we had to demand our order to be corrected.  For instance #2:  While watching the movie, our order came again wrong. My wife ordered a glass of ice water and a glass of wine, it took us three times to ask for the wine in the glass of water for my wife.  When our check came they charged us for each glass of wine that we inquired about even though we never received a glass. Once her glass of wine arrived, we had to request the other two glasses be removed from our bill.  Instead of removing the glasses of wine from our bill, they showed the two glasses of wine to be comped instead of removed.  For instance #3: The latest time while we are watching our movie, my wife's glass of wine came to us in the wrong type. She ordered the SMG Cabernet red wine and she received a Chardonnay. When we pointed out the error they finally brought the SMG Cabernet glass of wine for my wife. When the bill arrived it showed that they comped the Chardonnay glass of wine instead of removing it from our bill.  My flatbread pizza that was ordered with no onions arrived with onions and had to be sent back. The movie was more than half over when I finally received my pizza. After the movie I decided to go to the restaurant located towards the front of the movie theater and as I entered the restroom it was very dirty and in a shambles. The ground was spotted with blackfootprints throughout the restroom and I felt like I was in an roadside rest stop.  I haven't lost faith in Studio Movie Grill as of yet but I am almost at the point where I will not return. There has to be changes made for the better or they will lose my family as customers."}
{"text":"Had one of the worst experiences I've ever had....ordered my food 10min before the movie started after being let in only 15min before the movie started....after waiting for over an hour for my food and watching people who arrived well after me receive their food before me I had to flag down my \"server\" to find out where my food was to get the response of \"Oh no!\" And then \"Give me a minute...\" I got my food 10min later. They were quick to drop the check without even an apology for the bad service and long wait time for my food."}
{"text":"I went last weekend to chaperone a youth basketball team to see Black Panther. The front counter people were very helpful and friendly. When we got to the theater the worker indicated they were cleaning the theater and would make an announcement when the theater was ready. Our group was one of the first people inside the theater and we noticed that it wasn't very clean. There was sticky stuff around the cup holders. We were amongst the first people to order. We order the special we're you get appetizer and 2 entrees for $25 (Popcorn, Pizza, and coconut chicken fingers). They brought out our drinks, however, we noticed that everyone around us that had came in way later than us started to get their order fulfilled. After about an hour into the movie, I pressed the attendant button to ask about my food and he declared that it was on the way. We waited and still no food, yet he was steadily bringing other people who had order stuff after us there food! So I went to the server station at the entrance of the theater and asked where was my food, again they said it was on the way. I reminded them that we were the first to order and still haven't received at least our popcorn and it was more than an hour into the movie! They finally brought out my popcorn. Then about 15 minutes later, we were informed that the pizza machine was broken and we had to order something else! By this time I didn't want anything; but when the food finally came out it wasn't even great. When the server brought us our bill he recognized all the problems we had and credit is our bill. Thanks for that; however, I will not go back!"}
{"text":"I rarely go to the movies anymore... it's so much easier to stay home and eat cheap/healthy snacks and watch Netflix.  I make an exception for Studio Movie Grill though... the movie tickets are the same price as (or cheaper than) other theatres in the area, but this place is so much better!  *You reserve seats in advance, so don't have to \"get there early\" to get a good seat. *Seats are large and comfortable. *The whole building is very clean and has a cool bar or night club vibe.  You can eat and drink during the movie, but can also stay and hang out afterwards. *The food is really good, and they have some healthy choices.  The black bean burger and the Asian chop salad are two of my favorites (and the side of fruit is really fresh, good quality). *The service is fast, friendly and professional. *The seats are already very affordable, but they also offer deals on Groupon sometimes.  We went to see Jungle Book at SMG last Friday and I'm already looking to see when we can go back for the next movie!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worse SMG location I've been to. I was so disgusted by how dirty it was, I could not stand to eat the over priced, mediocre food.  The staff are pleasant and friendly but somehow forget that your primary reason for being there is to watch a movie. Staff regularly speaks loudly and blocks view.  I have now resorted to only coming to watch movies at this location and will never eat here again. For those in uptown (like me) it is convenient to walk to, but that's about the only pros to all the cons."}
{"text":"We didn't get food so can't comment on that. However, the  sound volume was deafening (especially during previews), and the seating was weird. We booked seats online and found we ended up with office chairs on a work environment \"mission control\" aisle. The last place I want to feel I'm at outside of my desk job is on a chair and desk that resembles my job! Fortunately, it wasn't full and we were able to get the recliner seats, but we still had to move another seat over as someone sat in front of us. They got the design of the lobby and elsewhere down well, but the actual seating seems like a haphazard last minute hack job with mix of non-reclining seats and office chairs at an angle which people's heads in the rown in front will block part of the screen. In addition, I hate wall-like barriers between rows - even if they don't block the screen, they're disruptive. In addition, all food orders should be taken and delivered before the movie as it's disruptive with waiters walking back and forth while trying to watch the movie. I understand movie theaters need other ways to make money these days, but having disruptions will backfire and people will choose to stay home to watch movies."}
{"text":"Let me start off with literally the only 2 complaints that I have about this theatre. You buy your tickets one floor below the actual theatre. Back in the day you would buy your tickets and take the escalator up from right there. Now you have to go back outside and either take the stairs up or wait on the elevator to go back up to the floor with the theatre. Its too much. You'll have to make sure to get your parking validated while you are here or you'll have to stop back through on your way out.  They also do not get a good variety of movies. No \"Urban\" movies ever come to this theatre. What do ya'll have against Tyler Perry and his following??? lol. But no really, they are really closed minded when it comes to their selection.  Now for everything I love, which is literally everything else! I don't know how people who come here can really complain about seeing the servers coming in and out. Ummmm its a MOVIE GRILL! If you're not going to be open to a different movie experience, why would you come here with such a closed mind? Walking into our designated theatre we were greeted with smiles and mints. We walked in and found our seats... which by the way, you can reserve!! How awesome is that??? The VIP seats on the side and the back are the best. They are not an extra charge, just first come first serve. When we sat down we were immediately greeted by a waiter. He took our drink orders and answered any questions we had about the menu. I came with 2 other people and was the last to order, by the time he got to me, one of my friends appetizers were already out!! They are FAST!!! We ordered appetizers and entrees and were finished eating by the time the previews were finished. I was REALLY surprised with how awesome the food tasted. I mean we were literally excited as we ate. We tried each others food and when we finished sat there with the ITIS!! I recommend the Quesadillas, Chicken Wings and Fries!! Their salads were also really big and good. Everytime I hit the button on my chair to call my waiter, he was there quickly. I love that button.  I like the way they remodeled the theatres. Before, I could easily hear what was going on outside in the bar. Now I can truly enjoy the movie. My movie was pretty packed recently so there was a lot of movement with servers, but it didn't bother me at all. I just paid attention to the movie. They also don't just stand around in your way so honestly I barely noticed them. And again, it's a movie grill, what do you expect.  I am constantly looking for movies coming out to have an excuse to come back. I love this experience!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry SMG, what has happened to you?  Yes you went through a remodel to take out the comfy, rocking seats and fit in more seats into the theaters... and the seats are fine, but when your competition is staying at home and streaming media content, a movie theater experience should be a little more comfortable.  When I think about the new seats, I liken them to just a step above a leather office chair.  Seats aside, it feels like the service has gotten slower (maybe due to the increased number of people in the theater).  We ordered drinks and popcorn and it took maybe 20-25min to get drinks and the \"large\" popcorn came cold and the top of the bag rolled up as if it was someone's left-over popcorn getting ready to go home.  My friend and I also noticed that our feet were sticking to the floor on the way out of the theater (in the common space!).  It really doesn't take that much to make me happy, but the combination of cleanliness, slow service, and having servers constantly blocking my view made for a bad movie-going experience.  Unfortunately for me and my friend, we had seat at the top of the stairs, so an un-impeded view of the screen, but half the movie was trying to move and see around the servers due to the family that ordered a TON of food and drinks... for some reason they kept sending the food back or maybe they couldn't figure out who ordered what, but it was really annoying.  No, I did not want to hear, \"I ordered extra oranges with my Blue Moon\" being yelled at the server during the movie's quiet scene... kinda kills the entire progression of the story line.  Another thing I noticed was the soap dispensers in the guys bathroom were empty and instead, there were soap dispensers on the counter, which is fine, but I take it as an indication that there's been a change in how they do things here.  I want to note that the bathroom sink was covered in water.... yes it's a sink, but I would think the water should make it into the basin and not be all over the place (well hopefully it was mostly water).  The lady beside me also ordered a popcorn, and I gave her a warning that it took a while and it was only 3/4 full with the top rolled up.  Her popcorn never came, but she wasn't missing anything at all... and saved some $$."}
{"text":"If all you are doing here is watching a movie and maybe having a drink or two, then this is a great place to do it.  They have a bar outside the theatres to gather at and socialize before or after your movie.  The theatres are comfortable with big chairs that rock slightly and it is stadium seating.  Drinks are good and they even have a couple of local craft beers on tap.  The sound system is decent as well and the walkways are well lit.  The problem here is the food.  After two tries, I have determined it is best to eat before your movie because both times I was severely disappointed in my meal.  This time around I had a California chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Unfortunately, It was too dark to tell but I could swear the chicken was under cooked.  It was quite chewy and I just couldn't stopped eating it for fear of getting sick.  The rest of the sandwich was bland.  The fries were the best thing here but what I ordered was sweet potato fries and I received regular fries.  I had a slice of my friend's pizza and that had to be the most horrible pizza I ever had...even worse than a generic frozen pizza from a local grocery store.  The dough was chewy and it had no flavor.  Friends in front of us had burgers and they said the burgers were decent so maybe that is what to order here.  How badly can you screw up a burger anyway?  The problem here is you want to come for the experience of eating dinner and watching your movie but the dinner part falls flat.  So why come here if 1/2 of the experience is flat?  You might as well head to a normal theater for a better all around experience than to be distracted by other people eating dinner while you are trying to enjoy a movie.  Sorry, SMG, If it weren't for the fact that Carolina Theatre Preservation Society is holding their movies here, I doubt I would be back.   Next time I will eat dinner before I come though.  There are plenty of decent options around the theatre in the Epicentre."}
{"text":"The place needs a face lift.  Kiosk machines broken again.   Seriously needs new management to run this place. 2nd time here in the past 2 months and no improvements.  We are considering other theaters instead of this place for our next movie."}
{"text":"This is our second time seeing a movie here and enjoying the food. I got the chicken fajitas with sweet potato fries - really great! came with cream cheese and some kind of tomato sauce (bland) on the side ) ... maybe ask for ketchup. My son got the build your own pizza - pretty authentic and the cheese tasted fresh and expensive. Then we got the sundae - yummmm. Pretty awesome to have real food and drinks during a movie - it's a really fun experience."}
{"text":"What a great place. It's such a cool concept. You pick your seats when buying the tickets, sit down, press a little red button and a server promptly comes over to take your food and drink order. The customer service is always fantastic, really nice and fun servers. The seats are comfortable and they have retractable trays to eat your food on. It's a great date night idea for an even better price. Movie tickets are about that of a regular theatre and same with the price of food. I love coming here during the week when it's slower, the weekends can be pretty busy, as expected. I always order my tickets and seats in advance online. It makes the process a little bit easier and assures that we get our desirable seats."}
{"text":"I was a pretty regular customer at studio movie grill. Great coupons, good seats, food was eh (it's a movie theater who cares, right?). Then the quality went downhill. First, no more coupons (whatever, it's life). Then I had multiple experiences with deplorable waiters. The $25 appetizer + meal deal requires that apps and meals are served at the same time. Nbd except the fact that there's no room to hold all of the plates. I asked the waitress if I should put the app in my lap considering the trays had no more space and she replied:  \"that's up to you\"  She took the main courses back. Then the waiter came to lecture me about corporate policy regarding orders during the movie(apparently all orders must arrive at the same and all the food I sent back went to waste as a result), irritating other movie goers. It was incredibly embarrassing.   Next time, I had a studio movie grill employee invite his teenage buddies to the movie we were watching. Said employee sat down in the theater chairs multiple times in the movie to chat with his friends. I spoke to the mgr after the movie and he decided thAt I was confusing waiters asking for orders. I'd been there enough. I wasn't. He asked why I didn't say something during the movie..... No customer service skills. No apologies.   Most importantly:  Finally, no longer are the chairs in pairs. They are now all connected like airline seats so you get to share an arm rest. You can't get away from all The jerks on their phones. The cheap tix are no longer worth the hassle.   Go to roadhouse. This place is going down the drain."}
{"text":"Staying at a nearby hotel and looking for something to do on a Sunday morning, we were glad that this place was nearby with a movie, drinks and discounts!  Go before noon on a Sunday and tickets are just six bucks. House wine is five bucks on Sundays (of course you have to wait until after noon to get it).  They also had a pizza special going, but we had just had breakfast.  Cool that you pick your seat before you go in!  We pretty much had the big theater (Theater 3) to ourselves anyway.  We had recently eaten, but had saved a little room for a large popcorn to share (good!)  We each started with a San Pellegrino at just four bucks each (and they were good size ones, complete with lime), since we were ten minutes before alcohol-time.    (Honestly NC, what difference does alcohol make at 12 noon versus 11:50???)    I was happy with my after-noon house chardonnay, and Husband really liked his Creamy Caramel Macchiato Shake: Three Olives Espresso Vodka, Coffee and Caramel with Ice Cream.  I was rewarded with a tasty sip and appreciated it for him, but was happy with my $5 chardonnay.  Surprise of the experience for Husband:  Attendant in the Men's room!  Hadn't run into that before at a movie theatre, that's for sure!  Apparently he could have had his choice of men's cologne.  So I armed myself with a dollar bill before my Women's room experience and didn't need it.  Nope.  Just me and my lonesome in a nice clean restroom.  (perhaps Husband imagined it?  :)  Movie:  Screen, sound...all good!  I see from previous reviews that perhaps Charlotte is not adequately appreciating what you've got...may I just say...how about coming to Raleigh SMG?  We'll appreciate you just fine!"}
{"text":"I like the seating and convenience but, the food sucks. Every time we go we've tried to like the food. We don't order anything anymore. And We found a better place to go."}
{"text":"I went to see Thor in 3D and we ordered the 2 for $25 deal and had an adult milkshake, it was all delicious!  It was a little difficult to see what our food, but it all tasted good, I highly recommend Studio Movie Grill!"}
{"text":"One of the three dine in theater experiences in the valley. This is much more casual than I-Pic or AMC Dine In at Esplanade. Sleek looking theater. I liked the cool upcoming movie advertisement display. The bathroom decor is cool. The wall paper is kind of made to look like an old studio set dressing room. The movie seating is somewhat different. I felt like I was at a school board meeting or Professional Development conference. You sit in chairs with a long counter in front of you for a table. Not the same as the AMC recliner chairs at all. It was comfortable though.     I like the dine in theater concept but they are just way too expensive and overpriced for just okay/bar food. I had a Portobello Sandwich, fries, and a side salad. The fries were cold and the portions were pretty small for the 20 dollar price. The salad had nothing in it really. Thank God the movie was free for an educator preview showing of the, \"Bully.\" It would be an expensive night out for a movie ticket and a meal, which did not even fill me up.     I do like the dine in theater concept. It is a lot of fun. If you like to drink even better since they have a bar in the lobby. I just think these theaters out price most folks. It is an only,\" every now and again\" treat. For that though you should be able to enjoy the nice atmosphere and staff here!"}
{"text":"On vacation in Scottsdale, and found a $5 grouping or this theatre.  There's a full lobby bar, which is cool. When you check in at the box office you can select your seats. There are two styles of seating, one that's a desk-style seat where you let rolling desk chair faces the scree and you have your food desk in front of you. The other style is stationary chairs with a table to your left that you move in front of yourself for foods the second option feels much more like the theatre style seating you're used to.  The size of the screen is huge, so I'd recommend sitting a little higher up. The sound in the theatre is awesome!! You get a full menu with beer, wine, premium alcoholic drinks, and regular drinks. There are appetizers, pizzas, salads, and a bunch of other food options. At the push of a button a movie-hop comes and takes your order and you pay towards the end of the movie.  Regular piece tickets are only $9.50 with is a great price for the quality you he here."}
{"text":"I will definitely be back to this location.  The seats aren't that special, given what other new or remodeled theaters have to offer, but then again, they do come serve you food.  They do it though without really interrupting anything, so they have mastered that which I like.  Good screens and sound and a nice bar/waiting area."}
{"text":"First run movies at great prices, make certain you get a Groupon to enter the movie at a discount priceof $6.  Also depending on what you order you could get the 2 meals for $25  Beginning to be a favorite, get the reclining seats not the office chairs.  Service has always been excellent and one of the best thing is you can reserve seats which we love so you don't have to wait in long lines for big premier shows like Star Wars, etc"}
{"text":"Meh.   Basically describes it. Food, service, and drinks are all mediocre. I tried a Daiquiri and it was disgusting, I'm pretty sure it was just rum with  a few strawberries and NOTHING else. The computer chairs are terrible to sit in and awkward if on a date, I'd recommend booking online or going early to get the lounge chairs with trays. However, even those are not the most comfortable. I go back purely because they have a lot of Groupons, probably to draw in more business as I see and agree the reviews aren't very good. I'd recommend AMC Esplanade over Studio Movie Grill or even IPic if you are looking to dine while you watch a movie."}
{"text":"The popcorn is the WORSE!!!  The service was not very good either, we ordered 2 drinks and butter popcorn, got the popcorn...ewww bad...where is butter..contacted wait service for more butter, it came, popcorn still BAD! 15 min. later 1 drink came, I said to friend \"well I guess you don't get your drink\" about 20 minutes later her drink came so all of this and a bad movie makes for I wish I had gone out somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to going here for a long time and when Beauty and The Beast came out my dream was finally realized. I was subsequently underwhelmed by the experience. The service and expediency, and food quality was lacking. My biggest letdown was that the seats do not recline and are somewhat uncomfortable. They have office chairs as some of the seat choices and I get my fill of that seating choice M-F 8 hours a day at work. The food was one step above concession food at a sporting event. Not horrible quality but mass produced and missing flavor. The weird part is we didn't get our water until halfway through the meal and were downright parched. Water should always be served first, especially in hot AZ. We had to ask twice for water and the waiter said they were backed up. Regardless, I was still very thirsty! We ordered the pretzels with queso, nachos, chicken tenders, mac and cheese, chicken salad and brownie ice cream desert. The queso had that sitting under a heat lamp film on it and the pretzels were oily but this was also the best thing I ordered so it sets the bar pretty low. The nachos had a ton of shredded lettuce on it and were lacking substance. It was so dark that I couldn't see what I was eating. I held out with each bite that maybe it would be cheese/chicken/tomatoes but it was always more lettuce. The chicken tenders were overly breaded and hard, the mac and cheese was bland with over cooked noodles. I loved the desert, it was well done and something I would order again. Next time we will dine out and go to a regular movie theatre. I prefer to be comfortable, well hydrated and eat popcorn with my Icey!"}
