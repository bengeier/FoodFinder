{"text":"went here on a saturday night, with two friends.. there were a customers not many. Server was friendly and quick. They have updated their menu again.. food came quickly and hot. thumbs up.. can never go wrong with the big boy combo.. yummy"}
{"text":"Stopped at Big Boy on Brookpark Road, haven't been there in years but it was on my \"bucket list.\"  Ordered the famous Big Boy Combo carry-out.  It was made quickly, but while I was waiting the manager and a server went outside and stood right by the door to take a smoke.  I would've commented on this directly to the manager but I've done this in the past and they really don't care.  The manager came in and put Purell on his hands right away but the server did not.  I think that's gross, they should not be allowed to stand right out in front of the \"in\" door and smoke.  Gross.  The food was okay, the Big Boy wasn't as good as I remember from years ago.  The cole slaw recipe definitely was NOT as good as it used to be, the fries were okay, tasted like Burger Kings if you like that kind of fry.  Anyhoo, I got it off my bucket list so that was about the only thing that was satisfying about this trip.  The road (I took W 130th) is so full of pot holes that it's a real chore just getting there!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in one day for a quick bite to eat because cooking was not desirable with my newborn that day. First of all it took 5 minutes to be seated in a restaurant that was 25% occupied. It took three people to figure out where we were going to sit. Our \"waitress\" was SO rude.  I don't think it was intentional, however, the hate for her job was crystal clear. She had no manners.....and people skills forget about it! When I told her my burger was cold and my cheese wasn't melted, she told me they don't melt the cheese despite the cheese on my husbands burger being melted. Regardless, my burger was still cold and when I restated that to her she rolled her eyes and said she would take it back.  On her way to the kitchen, she mumbled something to the manager , the manager snickered and the waitress went into the kitchen. Just overall an unpleasant experience. Yeah the store is newly renovated, but the attitude was not! Will not be going back."}
{"text":"4 stars for simply having \"pick 4 items\" on the breakfast menu for under $7 dollars. You can't beat that. That's 2 hot cakes, 2 pieces of sausages, 2 eggs, and hash browns. You can pick whatever and it still will be under $ 7 dollars. Their milkshakes are good too. If you like milkshakes you won't be disappointed. 

The Brookpark location is cool. I like this location better than Granger. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"Went there last night around 9:30 pm.  At first we thought it had closed since all the exterior lights and the restaurant sign were dark.  Was open, however, and we were pleased to see the remodel.  Fresh, clean look.  Food still as good as when I was a teenager eating Big Boys in Wheeling, West Virginia.  This is my happy place, and glad to see that they are putting the money in the place to keep it updated.  Only complaint was that there was no hostess and we waited a while for a server to be free to be able to seat us.  Our server was was nderful."}
{"text":"This is what all Big Boy restaurants should aspire too. Great food and great service. Tabitha took our order today and made us feel right at home. I have to drive past the Big Boy in valley view to get here and it's worth the drive. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"This some where I will not return too,  food was great but service was highly disappointing. I did order eating and take out.  While eating in the server kept forgetting me.  
 Then once that debacle was over I return to my hotel with the take out for family to find missing items. I called to rectify it the night manager promised when I come back they would right my situation, cool I thought until I came in to get my paid for goods the next day.  The day manager put me through an inquistion and tried to make me feel like I had made a mistake. I hadn't  and pointed out his argument has no grounds.  I told him please check your records my name and number was there. He was very disgruntled when he found the record of my call and purchase."}
{"text":"OK, looking at the previous reviews, mine looks out of line. But all those reviews seem to be dated prior to the close-down remodel that this restaurant and the Valley View restaurant underwent. It looks very nice inside and out.

We stopped in on Thursday, July 9th around 9 PM. The restaurant was bright and clean. We were seated immediately. We ordered a burger and a grilled chicken meal. Our server returned to let us know that the chicken was going to take longer  because it was frozen. Well, OK, it's not like we were at Lola. The meals, however, took a long time and although our server was suitably apologetic, we weren't offered any kind of service recovery which would have been nice.

That said, the burger and fries were very very good and the chicken and mashed potatoes/gravy was very good too. The Broccoli was a very very small portion, though, and probably could have steamed just a little longer - it still bore a slight raw taste and feel. Not a big deal with a veg you can eat raw anyhow, but even the small portion went unfinished.

Overall, the food and server was good, points off for the kitchen for both the delay in preparation and the execution of the broccoli, but we would go back. It's Big Boy, he's there when you need him."}
{"text":"We came in with a large party to celebrate my sisters birthday. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. We were seated right away and our server Dan was fantastic. Our food was delivered quickly, all of our orders were correct (he didn't even have to write the orders down. Very impressive with a party of 12!), he was on top of everything! The food was excellent and the prices were very reasonable. 
We had originally picked to eat here because it was close to the skating rink we were going to afterwards. We couldn't have been happier with how everything turned out. 
THANK YOU to the staff for making my sisters birthday so enjoyable. 
We will be coming back"}
{"text":"The food here is nothing great but acceptable if absolutely nothing else is open.  The buffet is a disgusting dried out mess of processed food.  Stay away at all costs!"}
{"text":"Do you need a Big Boy fix?  In the greater Cleveland area?  If so, come here.  This location is off I-480 and along commercial and industrial Brookpark Rd.  The other Big Boy appears to be in Garfield Heights, toward the East Side suburbs.  At any rate, these are your only two choices for Big Boy fare in this area, let alone the entire state, unless it's a Frisch's franchise Big Boy.

I don't know what people are crowing about in a negative manner.  A Big Boy starts out with about 3.5 stars for me and then it goes from there.  Granted, this is not fine dining and the area is sort of vapid, with automakers' plants nearby.  While it's on a busy intersection, there is an amply sized parking lot.

I ordered a Big Boy combination, meaning the double decker burger with fries.  I also added a drink to that.  I've been here twice. On the last visit, they featured a slice of strawberry pie for 99 cents with your meal and, even though the pie was not among the ranks of stellar slices of strawberry pie I've had, are you going to complain about a slice of strawberry pie that cost you 99 cents?  O.k., we're at 4 stars!  Ring the bell!

Well, that's not what did it.  The prices were reasonable, the quantity of food was satisfying, the service was small town friendly, and the Big Boy burger was neatly stacked, which shows effort that is not always the case at other Big Boy locations.  And, they are all used to hearing that Californians and Westerners grew up with Big Boy restaurants on every corner and get to walk down \"Memory Lane\" when they order the classic Big Boy double decker burger at this diner styled chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Mc Donald's is now better. 

I'm sorry, I've heard my mothers stories of days if you're in which a big boy was something held on high. 
Meh to me. 

And of course, nothing beats McDonald's french fries."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for coffee and onion rings left there and hour later with a reminder of why I never go there. I will not be returning the service is slow..so slow that I never got the onion rings and I only got one cup of coffee.. 45 minutes ago they only have one person working the floor and it's not enough when they have more than five customers there ... I will not be returning 
steve's Diner here I come!!!"}
{"text":"I get a longing for a \"Big Boy\" now and again, my brother was a manager for Manners Big Boy in the 60's, and I worked there part time. So yesterday I went to store #0551.
I was seated, and I asked for the Big Boy combo, I ordered a Pepsi, I actually forgot that
I wanted a chocolate malt instead of a Pepsi. When the server came back with the Pepsi I mentioned that, and asked for a chocolate malt. about 5-7 min.later my combo arrived, the fries looked good, a generous portion, the coleslaw looked good too, the Big Boy looked like it had been there awhile or slightly squished, I waited, and waited for the chocolate malt, finally had to ask the server \"how's that malt coming along\" as she was taking an order at the booth behind me, she said \"oh I forgot, coming right up\" again I waited and waited, I finally heard the mixer running, and it was another 5 minutes until I got it. Let me say, I brag about your milk shakes/malts to friends, steak and shake hand dipped shakes...they are a joke, way too think, and McDonalds shake?..a poor excuse for a milk shake, why do they even bother giving you a straw? they should hand you a spoon, funny thing, I noticed the straw Big Boy gives you is twice the diameter of the McDonalds straw, and nowhere as think as the McDonalds shake. The fries were good, the coleslaw..so so. needless to say the server did not get the 18-20% gratuity, but did get a lesser one. All in all I felt the visit was a C- . Incidently, I noticed the remodel there, very nice. When I payed at the register I expected a \"How was everything?\"..didn't happen. My \"check\" # is 4486. Maybe next trip I will order take out, and eat in my car, or try the store in Valley View."}
{"text":"I come here a few times when visiting Ohio. I really enjoyed the atmosphere here. The food was okay. The times that I've come have been really busy. Of course, right away you're attracted to this restaurant because of the huge \"Big Boy\" outside. The breakfast here would probably be your best bet. Wasn't the best but I prefer it over the lunch options."}
{"text":"The service was lacking. You're suppose to be at least asked if you want Cole slaw with a combo, we didn't get that, the servers have to make there own shakes for their tables, which slows them down. The food after a little while decides to attack back like you weren't meant to eat it. Overall a very poor experience. Besides it's been a while since we set foot in a Big Boys establishment. 
We won't mostly be back."}
{"text":"Many years ago there was a Kip's Big Boy in my hometown if Fort Worth.  My favorite dish, which was available as a regular menu item back then, was Spaghetti with Chili.  It's  been at least 30 years since Kip's closed, so I was excited to stop by Big Boy this evening on the final night of family vacation.  Although the Chili Spaghetti is no longer on the menu, the waitress, Kristi, I think, was able to make it happen.  Even though I now think beans in Chili is a bit communist, I thoroughly enjoyed the dish as it was a nostalgic reminder of my childhood.  I'd also like to recognize the staff for putting up with the noise and mess our kids made.

Pros: great value, proximity to airport and nearby hotels.
Cons: Well, there are not any closer to where I live!"}
{"text":"I have  stopped at a few big boys on my travels and most, especially around Cincinatti, are very nice with great food.
I was ushered to my booth, the seat was a bit sticky and run down. The restaurant itself was rundown and the  bathroom needs an overhaul.
Seeing this I decided on the salad bar. The selections were ok, but the dressings were bland.
I also grabbed a cup of what I think was cheddar brocolli soup (There were no signs)
The soup was also bland.
So my assumption is that this Big Boy caters to older clientele who have to eat Bland food. It's not the place you want to go if  you want a decent meal.
The staff was nice, and nice to look at but the food is pretty bad."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Big Boy's in a while, but I was pleasantly surprised by this location. The restaurant was clean and roomy, and the food was good. I ordered the Super Big Boy sandwich, as I thought it best to stick with the classics, and I was not disappointed. The burger was tasty and the ingredients seemed fresh. It was a little pricey, considering the area and the type of sandwich, but overall, not a bad place to grab a sandwich."}
{"text":"I came here with my family one night and it was great. The server was nice and attentive. Burger and fries were plenty warm. The prices are pretty darn good too."}
{"text":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT  
The interior has been redone  which  is  the  only  reason why   this restaurant  gets any stars. Our server was horrible. We ordered  shakes which were promptly made but she forgot to bring out, so they were runny by the time we got them. The cooks didn't time our order correctly  so half of our meals sat under heating lamps for at least 20 minutes. During  this time she neglected  to check in on us or bring refills. Most of our food was cold and nasty. 
WILL NOT GO BACK"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm visiting Cleveland I always stop here, since I can't get the wonderful double-decker Big Boy sandwich back home in northern California.  The place had just been redecorated, so everything looked fresh and new.  On my two visits the food was consistently superb (4 1/2 stars) but the waitress service was HORRIBLE.  I've been eating in restaurants for over 57 years, and once was a waiter myself, back in the day, and can't say it emphatically enough that the wait service on these two visits was some of the worst in the history  of humankind.  At the end of my second visit I asked to speak to the manager, which is something I haven't done in decades.  He proved to be a dunderhead, too.  I thought if this guy is training his waitresses, it's little wonder that the service was so odious.  How sad that such great food in a pleasurable atmosphere is negated by a disrespect for the most basics of customer service."}
{"text":"A long wait for this place to reopen and I am sorry to say I can't give more than three stars.  The staff was extremely friendly.  The atmosphere was clean and inviting. But sadly. The food was not as exciting.  Today I ordered the chicken and waffles.  The chicken came out well cooked and seasoned.  No problem there.  The waffle came out what appeared as well cooked.  Until I took the bite. The inside was really undercooked.  I tried a different section of the waffle and it too was undercooked.  I couldn't eat it. I ate the chicken and left still hungry. But did not want a replacement meal.  I tried to pay. And he manager came over and apologized. And did comp the check. I wanted to pay. The three stars I am giving is because of the manager and friendly staff. And inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not sure where the low ratings came from. At all. 

Here's a summary for you:
- Food is great. Quality, good proportions, fresh. 
- Atmosphere is relaxed and CLEAN. 
- Our waiter was great. He memorized our orders verbatim without a single mistake or a single pen stroke. (He's a young slim African American kid. You'd be lucky to have him wait on you. Perfect service. Literally.)
- Didn't break the bank. Spent maybe $25 for endless spaghetti, country fried steak, soup, two drinks, AND a shake. (Their sausage gravy sauce is DELICIOUS by the way. Crazy flavorful.)
- It took about two to three minutes to get seated. This is because the hostesses were also behind the counter or printing checks and such. Understandable. 

Overall, if you like flavorful diner food that's a tad higher on the quality spectrum of chain restaurants, or if you just like Big Boy's to start with, this is a great location."}
{"text":"Y'all need to shut this franchise down if this is how they are ran!!! 1 person trying to run the whole floor while a lady walks around doing all but nothing. Taking forever to get drink refills, food refills and all your food is definitely a way to get people to come back. Server is so stretched out that he can't pay attention to any table. Won't be coming back to a Big Boy any time soon. You have officially taken over as the worst restaurant experience ever. Thank You!!"}
{"text":"On occasion, I have a craving for a breakfast buffet.  I mean, I absolutely love buffets!  I think they're God's gift to man.  Seriously.  All that variety?  My family was looking for a place to get their breakfast on after church on Father's Day so I suggested Big Boy.

Now, the place could use some updating.  I mean, it hasn't changed much since I was a kid.  But still it stands, serving up hot and fresh breakfast buffet in the AM hours.  We were not disappointed with the food (fresh pancakes, waffles, sausage, biscuits, and gravy).

I loaded my plate up with biscuits, gravy, and sausage and I was in breakfast heaven.  I realize this isn't the healthiest breakfast, but every once in a while, you've gotta get back to your roots.  Biscuits and gravy were a staple in my family growing up.  I have yet to taste better sausage gravy than my grandma's.

This place is good for breakfast."}
{"text":"It was not busy at all when we ate here, yet the service was slow. We saw our food sitting in the window for at least five minutes before it was brought to us. I had the bacon mac and cheese it was cold, the bacon was undercooked and the sauce was watery. The staff all seemed miserable. I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"The food is not the worst, but it's not something special to seek out. Could be the location, but first impressions are everything. Don't bother with the Endless Pasta, if you're going to get Alfredo and penne.. You would be better off getting $1 Michelina's TV dinners and heating them up. In fact I'm pretty sure that's what hey did, except you're charged almost 9 bucks for them to do it for you."}
{"text":"I whent their for the first time in my life and found out the big boy burger is nothing but a big Mac like Mikey Dee's but with a different sauce {{Bummer I was looking for a man verses food size burger))!. THE FOOD WAS TASTY THOUGH!!"}
