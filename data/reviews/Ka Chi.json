{"text":"We go to Ka Chi weekly and it's definitely our go-to destination for a good, cheap and quick meal.  It's all about the pork bone soup it certainly measures up against everywhere else we've been in Toronto, so much so that I know that it's generally 53 that I'm ordering off the menu. The dolsot bibimbap is pretty awesome as well, plus you get all the assortment of side dishes.  I find this location better than the newly opened one down the road on Dundas and a nose ahead of the original location in Ktown."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I saw that Ka Chi was opening up in the neighbourhood! It's definitely a type of food that is lacking in the area, and I used to love the one in the Annex / Christie Pits area. It was a long wait and I went as soon as I could.

That being said, this place is kind of a let down. The interior decor is sort of nice, but there are WAY too many TVs. They are everywhere - you'd think it's a sports bar. 

The food is way better than the Dundas Ka Chi, but considering the price it's a big letdown compared to the old Annex spot. Simple Bi Bim Bap (with Bulgogi) was $18... and all you get with it is a tiny bit of pickled daikon and kimchi - none of the other little bowls of food you'd typically get (soy beans, glass noodles, etc). So, they're charging you way more than other spots (every other one charges $10.95 for the same) and giving you a lot less. The Annex Ka Chi used to give you a pitcher of tea, I hate to think what I'll get for the same price at this location.

Honestly, this place feels like a moneygrab. I'll probably go back begrudgingly because it's the only spot nearby, but it would cost less to take transit to one of the cheaper locations. If they drop their prices by the 30% they ought to, I'll happily revise my rating and probably take a lot of friends and visitors there. As it stands now, no way.

Ka Chi - next time buy fewer TVs and keep your prices in line."}
{"text":"My favourite place to come to when I come to Down Town.
Best Price to Portion Size ratio around. 
Man Size portions.
Taste is Excellent, that's is you are into spicy foods, they great have non spicy dishes too, for those that can't handle the heat."}
{"text":"Yo!  This was a solid choice.  I'm an out-of-towner and I can tell you that this place kills any Korean I've had in my hometown.  Kim-chi was really great.  The chicken bolgogi that I got was just-right spicy and when combined with rice, excellent.  Quick service, good lunch spot, I recommend it."}
{"text":"always a great value but inconsistent across their 3 locations (bloor, kensington and dundas (Chinatown).  - they have a wide selection of popular korean dishes with the best being their white fish stew, seafood pancake and the kimchi tofu stew.   

Their sides dishes can be uninteresting and boring (pickled cucumbers are the best, but not always available), which is why I gave 4 instead of 5. 

Highly recommend if you are in a rush and want a quick hearty meal  - service is swift and friendly."}
{"text":"Yes the food is good, BUT twice i've ordered the Kimchi stew \"without meat\" and had to pick out little tiny pieces of pork, which makes me think they just scoop out the  bigger pieces.  

Also, the last time I was in there one of the servers had a fresh, open, third degree burn on his arm that he acquired in the Kitchen, and he just continued serving like it ain't no thang.  Which was kind of gross, to be honest."}
{"text":"This place is not fancy and the service isn't great but the food is fantastic and authentic and it is very, very affordable.  It's an authentic Korean fast-food type experience - you order, eat, pay, and leave.  It is what it is, so don't come here if you expect wonderful service, or a quiet, intimate atmosphere.  DO come here if you want fast, cheap, delicious, authentic Korea food!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been going there for years now (the original one in Bloor and since to their new location on Bathurst).

I always order the bulgogi and squid with kimchi. The portions are great and the dish is delicious, it has never disappointed me. I also enjoy the small side dishes they give you, its a good touch.

The wonton soup with rice cakes is super yummy and very filling as well. I also recommend the seafood pancake, their dumplings are not the best though. 

I have to say that the last couple of times the service has been super slow and a bit inefficient! i feel like you have to keep on calling the waiters to get any attention..."}
{"text":"Very good place for Korean food. Tried to go to Korean village but it was packed so headed this way. Got the spicy squid on a hot blaze with some steamed beef dumplings. Both I would recommend. Squid is a little stiff but still good. Very loud music so if thats an issue for you, may not be the best choice.  Ooooooooh ya."}
{"text":"Great food--we had the tteokbokki and it was delicious!! Prices were average I'd say and the people working there were very nice!"}
{"text":"I'm starting off the new year with my first official review of a Korean restaurant which fittingly is Ka Chi's newest location (they have 3 now).  Several years ago, I went to a Korean restaurant with a group of friends somewhere on Bloor St W. near Christie Pits (the name and exact location escapes me).  That was close to 10 years ago and no one really knew what to order so our experience was slightly disappointing and I didn't go back again thinking Koreans only ate spicy cabbage (known as kimchi but spelling can be kimchee or gimchi but what the heck, just say it and everyone knows what it is).  Tip of the day: if you want a better first time eating experience when dining at a new food place that has a foreign menu, bring someone who knows what to order :) 

A few years ago, my friend who is non-Asian (Ok he's white as snow and I'm just trying to be politically correct - screw it) moved and lived in Korea for 3 years.  Upon returning, we met up and he took me to Ka Chi on Bloor St.  It was my introduction to the bibimbap dish and it was yummy.  Since that positive experience, I tend to order the hot stone pot bibimbap dish every time we eat at a Korean restaurant.  The Ka Chi on Bloor was my first experience at their restaurant.  The dish was excellent as I chose the thinly sliced beef (chicken, pork and vegan were also available), comes in a very hot stone pot with rice plus veggies, then topped off with an egg and reasonably priced (I recall being $8-9).  The service was mediocre but my friend did mention not to expect top notch service but i would give them 4 stars overall at that time (haven't been back so perhaps their ratings have changed?).  Place was quite busy considering it was a Saturday at 3pm in the afternoon but a bit far from my normal stomping grounds so I haven't been back since.

Later in the winter, we heard they had opened a new location closer to me in Chinatown/Kensington on St. Andrew St.  I took my friends there and introduced them to bibimbap.  My second experience was a tad disappointing as they didn't even fill the stone pot half way with food.  I seem to recall my initial experience being better.  Service was again average so my rating drops a notch to 3 stars.  I have since found several places which offers better quality, value and service so I've been avoiding Ka Chi ever since.

A couple of days ago my friend wanted to go and told me they opened another new location in Chinatown a few months ago on Dundas St. W. (I think it used to be a Japanese restaurant called Shima).  I mentioned that I preferred other places but he said their pork bone soup was great so we went to try it out.  I wasn't in the mood for soup so I opted for the bibimbap... I should have gone for the soup.  The bibimbap was again not very good value with only half a bowl but it was ok tasting.  Next time I'll definitely try the soup.  Not sure why they got 2 locations in Chinatown cos I didn't know we Chinese folk liked Korean food so much?? If I had to choose between Chinese or Korean restaurant, I would select Chinese as there is a much wider selection of dishes on a typical menu.  Overall, another 3 star rating again for service, food and decor is nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Personally, I have been to Ka Chi a couple times at various locations. This is my second time at Ka Chi on Dundas street. The decor is pleasant and the washroom is pretty clean too. 

I always order pork bone soup, as well as other dishes(hot plates or pancakes)  on the side to share with my friends. There's a lot of meat in the pork bone soup unlike some Korean restaurant that I've been to in Korean town where there's more bone in the soup than anything else. The side dishes were good as well though the potion was really small. Our server was fast and polite, and kept bringing out side dishes for us.

Yes yes, everything is awesome here and why does it deserve only 2 stars?

The whole experience was destroyed when the cashier told me that we weren't paying enough tips in a way I wouldn't consider that as polite. I was shocked at first, then I tried to explain that's impossible. He pointed and told me to go back to my friends and settle it among ourselves. It was extremely embarrassing!

When my friends return with me to the cashier and recalculated the bill, it turned out that he (cashier) miscalculated. He mumbled a \"sorry\" and we left the restaurant with a really bad impression. 

I understand that the staffs need to make a living too, but I have never met anyone who demanding for higher tips. And if 16% is not enough, then they might as well market themselves as fine dinning and list expensive wine on their menu instead of soju. It is doubtful that we will ever go back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever experienced,  and it wasn't the servers, but the actual owner of the place. He was verbally abusing the servers, making it such an unpleasant environment to eat in. feel bad for the people working under such boss."}
{"text":"came here for dinner and ordered the Famous 'Pork Bone Soup'. This place was just as I expect from a simple Korean restaurant - tasty but not excellent. Overall it was decently priced and service was good. alot of variety to choose from and i will definetly come back to try the other stuff such as the BiBimBap (which i heard was good) and the other stone pot soups which have kimchi flavoured broths. yum!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found Ka Chi after trying other Korean restaurants near the downtown area and we're glad we did - it's now our go-to place and we eat there at least once a week. 

My wife loves the spicy rice cake and glass noodles (chap-jae). I'd advise against ordering the spicy rice cake with noodles because the noodles are just instant noodles added in. 

I like their pork bone soup as well as their stone pot bibimbap dishes, especially the beef with fried egg bibimbap. You can ask them to make it with spicy beef (they prepare it the same way as the spicy pork), which I find much tastier than just adding the hot sauce afterwards.

Service is quick and friendly. The pitcher of hot rice/flower tea is nice, especially during the cold winter months.

The serving sizes are huge for reasonable prices.

We'll definitely keep going to Ka Chi."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Dec 30th, 2012 - the last day at this location.  They had signages posted up all over the place saying that they were going to re-locate down the street.  But when I enquired as to where exactly they will be moving to, the waiters couldn't tell me!  They said that they will re-open at the end of Jan.  So I don't think they have confirmed their new location yet. It is probably a good idea for them to move, as the current location looks rather tired & the seating is really tight.   

I had the bulgogi beef bim bim bap & my friend had the regular spicy pork bone soup.  The food was average. I think there was relatively less beef in my bim bim bap when compared with the same dish at other Korean restaurants  I felt that the food at Ka Chi located at Dundas St W. (Chinatown) tasted better & was better prepared.  Plus that newer location is much more comfortable & spacious."}
{"text":"Lots of great options, had the chicken bulgogi and came out on on a sizzling cast iron plate. The kimchi and other sides were alright, I've had better at other places. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is super friendly. 

The chef was an old Korean lady cooking up a storm in the kitchen. I'd go back for my next Korean fix."}
{"text":"I went there when they first opened to this new location.  The quality of their pork bone soup was subpar.  The pork bone was not savory enough - perhaps it was too early on during the day (4pm)?"}
{"text":"Ka Chi previously located at 612 Bloor Street West has re-opened at this location.  This new location is much bigger than its previous location.  Great for group gatherings now! The high ceilings & the contemporary decor is so much nicer than before too.  The washrooms are clean and modern.

The menu is same as before, with the exception of a few additional beef items.  Tonight my friends and I had fried beef dumplings, spicy pork bone stew, tofu bim bim bap & stir-fried beef rice cakes.  All portions were generous & the taste was good.

Waitstaff were friendly and attentive.

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here tons of times, including yesterday.  Here's the lowdown on Ka Chi:

Pros:

- Pork bone soup is really, really good.  Despite the annoyance of having bones in the soup  
- Side dishes are pretty good
- Food is cheap
- They play really bad \"modern rock\" over the stereo.  Theory of a NickleCreed type stuff.  Don't get me wrong, I hate this kind of music, but I find it hilarious that this is their choice of music for some weird reason.

Cons:

- Service can be a little spotty sometimes
- Food can be very spicy (even for Korean food).  Not really a bad thing, just be aware of it 
- If you get any pork bone soup on your light coloured clothing, you will never get it out.
- They play horrible \"modern rock\" over the stereo"}
{"text":"Came here and one of the waiters seemed to be meticulously cleaning a couple of the front tables (well...it took him a good 15 minutes wiping them down and they didn't look that dirty). 
Anyway, for this cold spring day, I decided to have the soft tofu stew with beef & vegetables  that came with a side of rice ($7.50) to warm me up.  It came with a few sides: seaweed, kim chi, potatoes and jap chae.  I love jap chae so I was happy. The jap chae noodles this time were flat which was unexpected but delicious nonetheless.  I was also given a jug of genmaicha tea - nice!
The stew was delicious - it came piping hot and still bubbling.  It was filled with large chunks of tofu, a lot of small beef slices, zucchini, enoki mushrooms, and an egg. Stuffed. Yeah, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in town!  The owner always greeted us with a smile and kinds words.  She's fantastic, and the food is amazing!  Yummy appetizers come with your dishes too!"}
{"text":"My friend took me last night for the first time and I loved it! He goes so many times that the owner came over to say hi. :D

I don't know the Koren names but we ordered some apps which came in little bowls. tofu, yummy noodles, spicy kim chee..... and a few others. 

We shared the steamed chicken dumplings and then each has the spicy chicken stew/soup that was so hot, it was bubbling when they served it on the iron pot. It was spicy goodness :)

**If you are in Kensington Market and you are hungry & cold, pop in for a nice bowl of soup***"}
{"text":"Yum! We went after the David Bowie exhibit last week and it was good. The place was packed. My friend suggested that we go there. His boyfriend LOVES the pork bone soup. I don't eat pork so I had the hot chicken stew. It came with sides that were all each so different and good. My friend said that they will give you more for free if you ask. I ended up leaving stuffed and taking half of it home with me. I can still taste the hot yummy goodness. Cheap too!

**They have lots of tables for groups. Go with a group and share some things, that's what I'm going to do next time :) ***"}
{"text":"I love Ka Chi and the pork bone stew. The patio in summer is pleasant with a nice mixture of shade and sun, right across the street from the iconic Honest Ed's. The service is excellent and it's an enjoyable place with very reasonable prices.  I want to give them 5 stars, but the quality of food is not always there. I really love the place, but they could improve on their ability to provide consistently good food - it's so good, when it's good!"}
{"text":"It's really embarrassing for me that as a Korean, I can't review Korean restaurants in nearly as much detail as some of the ones listed here.

I do dine Korean a lot, so what I can say is that the food is priced on par with other Korean restaurants. Ka Chi isn't really known for anything in particular, as Owl of Minerva is known for pork bone soup and Buk Chang Dong is known for its tofu soup.

What Ka Chi does have going for them is that they're close to U of T, whereas the renown Korean places are in...K-Town. Additionally, they have a rather diverse menu that simultaneously caters to hot spicy soupy Korean eaters like me, and my whitey white boyfriend that hates stews. Along that thread, the servers all speak or understand English very well.

Like the portions in their meals, their side dishes are quite ample and diverse. Even me, the kimchi fiend doesn't go through it all in a meal. One serving is usually enough for two meals for me.

However, it should be noted that in most Korean restaurants, the side dishes come out immediately after you order, usually resulting in you to nibbling on them before your food comes out, and ordering refills. Ka Chi waits until your meal is ready and it all comes out together.

One common icky thing I've noticed here is that they take forever and a day to bus tables once the customers have left. I really don't like stepping into a restaurant and seeing gross unfinished food all over the tables."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Because of this wonderful place I now enjoy Korean food where and whenever I have the chance, I enjoy Korean tv and movies. I love the food here, the hot bowls specifically, with a refreshing bottle if Hite. The staff are great, such nice people. I am very pleased to see that they have reopened since the fire I was afraid that it would be longer. I had dinner there tonight, and I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"It hurts my heart how disappointing this place was! Any Korean ajumma would cringe if they ate here. 

We love Korean food and had been waiting for months in anticipation for this restaurant to open in our lovely Bloor West Village neighbourhood. 

Suggestions to owners/managers: 
- get rid of three quarters of your TVs! They are so distracting!
- serve actual banchan. kimchi is not enough!
- lower your prices by at least 20%
- add the actual name of the dish in Korean to the menu
- hire actual services. having someone take your order, drop it off and never return is *not* good service, especially in Bloor West. 
- add pictures to your menu

Please become a local restaurant we want to tell our friends, families and neighbours to go to. We won't be returning until we see some actual good reviews here. You can get better quality food and service in other nearby restaurants for much less."}
{"text":"The food is good to me. The atmosphere there is comfortable and relax. Overall a good restuant in the chinatown area;)
Recommend it"}
{"text":"I don't know why anyone would go to Ka Chi Bloor when there are a plethora of other superior Korean restaurants within spitting distance of the restaurant.

The only redeeming factor in this restaurant is...it's spacious? But they crowd all the guests into one corner, so even that's not a true benefit.

The service is marginal, you have to ask for everything explicitly, the food comes out in whatever order they feel like, the servers barely make eye contact, nevermind bothering to find out who ordered what. This leads to the food being placed willy nilly on the table, leaving the diners to move the food to the person who ordered it. What do I pay you for, again?

The food was pretty dismal, I knew that the dining experience would be disappointing when my army base stew, which comes in a earthenware pot, was not boiling. I took a sip to find that it was lukewarm...and sweet.

Everything on that table had a the same tangy sweet and sour flavour, on different vegetables and proteins.

The side dishes were also disappointing, with the kimchi being super fresh and not fermented at all.

Lastly, and most damningly, they screwed up the rice! The RICE! That gets made in a machine! They had clearly put too much water in the rice as all the structural integrity in the rice had been compromised and it was like eating large chunks of rice-flavoured clumps."}
{"text":"Visited after reading all these positive reviews from YELP.

The most notable thing there is the food. They have a vast range of Korean dishes and I chose the pork fried with kimchi that came with white rice and sides. The sides were as excellent as the main dish.

My complain about them is their service. I went in early noon when there were only 2 other tables occupied and the waiters weren't too busy. I kept sitting for 12 mins and no one came with a menu. Then I had to call someone and ask when could I see the menu. So, I took out two stars."}
{"text":"I don't like Korean. My mind hasn't changed since dining here. There always seems like something is missing. I think Korean food isn't sophisticated. It's just plain and by adding spice is the only way it's spiced up. Sorry, thumbs down. Plus way too much MSG in their cooking - yuck!"}
{"text":"Of the Ka Chi locations, this one by Chinatown is my favorite for pork bone soup."}
{"text":"We decided to brave the place despite the negative reviews and we are so happy we did! We had a Bibimbop and a Galbi and both were delicious.  The Galbi was maybe a touch on the sweet side but very tasty. The fried dumpling appetizer was also pretty good. I agree with the comments of the decor, they have 22 TVs (we counted!) which seems a little excessive. I would have preferred a cozy resto vibe, but I think they are just trying a different business model than the usual Korean resto. I liked was that the TVs were placed quite high up so they weren't as distracting as if they were at eye level. 

We also were a bit surprised at the prices - 18$ and 22$ for the two mains we ordered - but to be fair that is probably just due to cultural expectations, (ie. We are used to Korean food usually being priced cheaper) because our other 2 local haunts are around the same price. I guess my feeling is that this place is a bit confused - casual decor but high prices don't totally jive.

They have only been open a few days and I think they are still working out some Kinks. They forgot to bring one of our drinks and still charged for it but when we pointed it out he not only removed the charge but knock 10% off the bill without us asking which we thought was a nice touch.

We will definitely be back but we were already discussing doing takeout instead of staying in since the ambience isn't a particular selling point. But I suspect we will dine in often enough either way. Glad to have some Korean in the neighborhood! :)"}
{"text":"We were walking through Chinatown Toronto Friday evening and randomly picked a place for dinner. The restaurant is underground but there was a big menu at ground level for us to take a look at before we entered the restaurant. The restaurant was very clean, not your typical hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurant. 

Our party of 4 ordered the typical bulgogi, seafood pancake, kim chi tofu soup, spicy squid on a sizzling plate, and the stone pot rice bibimbap.

The portions are pretty huge. Everything tasted great and the price was reasonable. This place is worth a try!"}
{"text":"I write this review with a heavy heart and profound sadness.  I've been eating at Ka Chi ever since they were first located at Palmerston and Bloor.  Back then, their prices were dirt cheap, crammed space, but great food.  I didn't mind eating my pork bone soup elbow to elbow sitting at the communal table in the middle of that tiny space.

Then they moved to a bigger space across from Honest Ed's.  Much better ambiance, bigger space, prices went up but the quality of food remained excellent.

When they move to the current location, I waited with bated breath for their grand opening.  As other reviewers/old timers have already posted, the prices have gone way up and the portion size had gone down.  

A pork bone soup is now $12/bowl.  

And you only get two banchans: kimchi and pickled cucumber.  Before you used to get: kimchi, pickled cucumber, pickled carrot/turnip, glass noodle, seaweed, and potato smothered in a sweet sauce.  

The seafood pancake is the same price as the last location at $10/each, but is now about 1/2 the size as before. Less seafood and no choice to add rice cake in the pancake.  There's only one seafood pancake vs before you could get kimchi seafood pancake or seafood pancake with rice cake.

I will not return.  Rating it 2-stars for sake of nostalgia."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous! The interior is very well-lit and showcases just how clean everything is. The mini chandeliers are cute, without being overly ostentatious. I think that the fact that it occupies a basement location in Chinatown makes its cleanliness and decor all the more impressive. There are also massive TV screens on either end of the restaurant, so you can comfortably watch whatever is happening without making your dining companion(s) feel too neglected.

Kachi prides itself in its pork bone soup, and rightly so. Is it the best pork bone soup I've had? Possibly. Is it an excellent pork bone soup? Definitely. I have yet to find that curious layer of orange grease that is so often present on the top of PBS. I also liked the balance of ingredients (ie. pork bones, potato, bean sprouts, cabbage), though the ratios do vary. You may argue about the authenticity of the lime wedge, but I found it to be a nice addition, as it cuts back a bit on the richness of the pork bone. \"Authenticity\" is overrated anyways. 

The tofu soup is chock-full of ingredients, and dumplings are tasty. I also LOVE that they serve genmaicha along with your meal. A very classy touch."}
{"text":"I live close by so come here every so often. Decent place for Korean food in this area. I do like it better than Kimchi house and bapbo down the street but that's just a personal preference. Soup can be a bit salty though. I usually order their sizzling meat dishes. Servings are large. On the greasy side though. I like their spicy beef ribs, house recipe. Balchan are hit and miss. They charge extra for more than 1 refill. Service is so-so."}
{"text":"Decor is not the greatest however don't get deceived! The food was flavorful and tasted like authentic Korean food. I ordered a tofu stew which came with rice for just $10. You really can't beat that price with good food. Was it the best tofu stew I had? No but it was good enough for me to go back if I lived in Toronto."}
{"text":"With the seasons changing, I had unfortunately fallen victim to the common cold. However, the spices from the Kim Chi Fried Rice served in the Hot Stone Pot gave me relief from the effects of my sickness. It was tasty and spicy while maintaining flavour. We arrived near closing time but it didn't deter quality of the food or the service. Though the servers were reserved, they were kind to our requests and were patient with us. As someone who doesn't eat meat, I felt there were several options on their menu for me unlike most Korean places I've frequented (though this makes decisions a lot easier, haha). Can't wait to return for another delicious meal!"}
{"text":"All the dishes had this overwhelming taste and smell of dish soap like they didn't properly rinse them.  The taste was especially obvious with the water cups.  Otherwise the food was okay. Bleh can't get the soap taste out of my mouth now."}
{"text":"My new favourite Korean resto. Their bulgogi is the best in the city!"}
{"text":"Ka Chi on Bloor is one of my frequent haunts. Korean food in Toronto can be someone suspect (indeed, the worst food experience of my life was located at a now defunct Korean eatery on Bloor) but Ka Chi knows how to do it right.

Little more than a basic quick-eats style cafeteria with a sometimes quaint (depends on the night and the Bloor St. atmosphere) side patio bordering Palmerston, you might possibly get the idea that the food would be sub-par, though I have been told this is a fairly standard look on the streets of Seoul, and that one should never judge a book by its cover.

The menu is large, featuring many platter dishes (beef/pork bulgogi, squid, vegetables and kimchi variants, or combos thereof) as well as bibimbap. But nothing will put you over $15 after drink and tip. 

Though the steamed dumplings ($6) are the perfect starter, it may not be required, for your server will quickly set down a variety of tiny Korean starter dishes on the house: glass noodles, seaweed salad, potatoes, cucumber salad, rice, Korean miso soup, and of course kimchi. Yes, all that will be strewn across your table in a matter of minutes, so you'd best arrange your table quickly to accommodate!

The bibimbap are all piping hot, and feature generous portions of vegetables and meat (if chosen), and the platters chock full of delicious ingredients. The best of the bunch is surely the beef bulgogi, squid and kimchi platter...perfectly seasoned, importantly, not too salty, and neither the beef nor squid overdone.

Your servers will not be keen to assist you after having delivered your meal, but this can actually be a refreshing change and allows you to enjoy your meal out with friends without interruption. Everything you need (a pitcher of tea, a decanter of water, napkins, hot sauce etc) will all be given to you at the beginning. You simply get up and pay when you are ready.

It is certainly impossible to leave Ka Chi feeling unsatisfied, with an ample amount of food and variety. Don't let the cafeteria looks fool you, one of Toronto's best Korean meals awaits."}
{"text":"We were in the neighbourhood and headed towards our usual Korean restaurant when this place beckoned us. Thought we would give it a try. 

The patio was very nice and spacious to sit out on during a warm summer day. The waitresses was nice enough but we had a hard time flagging them down for another order of the cold side dishes and water. It's not like the place was super packed or that there wasn't any waitresses, it just seems like they were constantly purposely looking away from us when we needed them.

It was interesting to see all the variety of bibimbap they offered. Had to stick with a classic bibimbap since that was what I was craving. 

The cold side dishes that came, I found most of them to be too vinegary and not flavourful. Like they had pickled them just this morning and served them at dinner time the same day. 

The bibimbap tasted delicious but I didn't like how they substituted the sauce with Siracha sauce. Even though we could put as much as we wanted. Since the sauce was substituted, it didn't taste as good as traditional ones I've had. Other than that the bibimbap tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"Was walking into Kensington and came across this gem! As we walked in no one came to greet us and we had to get people's attention to be seated (why I only gave five stars) but after that everything was awesome! The waitress was very friendly and the food was GREAT. We had the kimchi pancake, Korean rice dumplings (dukkbuki) and chicken katsu. Portions were great for the price, we even had left overs for dinner later that night. I would highly recommend this place, big portions, good price, fast service, what more could you want?!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place got such low rating? This is my to-go Korean place in downtown. Authentic, clean, and excellent side dishes! I recommend their pork bone soup and seafood pancake :) pancake is especially crispy and delicious"}
{"text":"Having been to old Ka Chi before, much has changed at this new location

For starters the music is on par with a club in the downtown core, if you like screaming to communicate then this is your place

Now for the food, complimentary side dishes were tasty...onto what I ordered...pork bone soup, I found it peculiar that it came with a wedge of lime, now I know why

If you have never drank salt water then this is your lucky opportunity to do so, I wouldn't even call it broth/soup/etc at this point, salty enough to say it was bitter

I will definitely not be coming back, this is not the Ka Chi I once went to and enjoyed the food very much, they have modernized to crap which is unfortunate for a spot that was once good"}
{"text":"Food is good 
Service was ridiculously slow. Each time I eat here it gets worse and worse. 
They're slow and it seems like they don't give a shit."}
{"text":"I visited this place when it used to be located on the address stated here. Not sure if this one is another branch of the same franchise or got moved here but I found Ka Chi on Dundas near Dundas and Spadina.

I was craving the spicy ricecake dish but didn't want to go out of my way to go to Go Topoki, so I figured I would try here. After all, I tried the same dish a few years ago and remembered it tasting pretty good.

The place was practically empty except for one other customer. The server wasn't particularly friendly - felt like she was a bit curt. But she took my order promptly when it was apparent that I was ready (I stopped looking at the menu). I ordered the spicy ricecake dish (not the one with noodle nor the one with the beef).

It looked rather bland and felt like it had too many vegetables - maybe a good third of the dish was comprised of the vegetables. However, it wasn't as bland as I thought and it wasn't super spicy, which was good. It was decently filling, too (maybe because I drank a lot of water). The side dishes were meh - the seaweed one was too salty and the glass noodle one was rather dry."}
{"text":"Good cheap eats...lots of students (or people whoo dress like students, i.e. like it's their living room) and seems to be liked by Koreans so that's usually a good sign!  :)"}
{"text":"Great Patio. We had beef ribs Galbi, and Bulgogi + Squid sizzling platter. Both were amazing, and my friends who were new to Korean food absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"The place was jammed on a Wednesday night, but tables turn over quickly, so we weren't waiting very long.  I was starving so I knew I needed rice--stone pot bibimbap!  I hadn't had it at Ka Chi before, but it's hard to mess it up, right?

Yeah, not so much.  It was hot, and it was filling, but this was the blandest bibimbap I've ever had.  I don't know how they managed to suck so much of the flavour out of the dish, but it was very disappointing.  It also wasn't particularly cheap--at nearly ten dollars a bowl, I was expecting something amazing, but the bowl wasn't even hot enough to properly crisp up the rice.  SADFACE."}
{"text":"Quite the disappointment. I've dined at a few restaurants near Christie and Bloor as well as Yonge and Finch so I figured this place would be decent.
I ordered the Seafood Pancake. My friend had the Beef Bulgogi.

Seafood pancake was not appetizing. They did not clean the muscles nor the green onions, resulting in the taste of sand in a few bites. The pancake would crumble apart as soon as you picked it up resulting in a messy meal. This is one of my favorite Korean dishes (since I was a kid)... the pancake has never \"crumbled\".

The beef Bulgogi on a \"hot plate\" was just a gimmick. The ast iron plate was room temperature and they stir fried the beef. 

The servers seemed to have an idea of our dissatisfaction (I'm assuming) because they asked literally the other tables around ours how their meal was but ignored my friend and I. We had to walk over to one of the servers to get our bill and I had to ask the server to give me some privacy to place my pin when doing my transaction. It's one thing if the service staff as a whole do not ask customers in general about their meal but it is just rude when your table alone is, being ignored. 

SERVER TIP : Do not peer over customers when you hand them the keypad to see how much they will tip you. It's not only impolite, but can be misread as you (the server) trying to see the customer's pin number. ASK the customer how their meal is. If you ask one of your tables, you asked ALL of your tables. Ignoring that one customer (and making obvious motions of attending the other customers) gives a bad impression and looses your chances of receiving a good tip."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations for Ka Chi because I thought it was part of a chain and I've been to the other locations before where the food was pretty decent.

Food here looked good but tasted really bland, even the side dishes =(
I got the pork bone soup which loaded with meat but sadly, it just wasn't very good. Service was nice and prompt though.

I have yet to try the other dishes but I most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Ka Chi is our go-to place on a cold winter's night. We usually order the spicy chicken stew to warm us up after a brisk walk. Always served piping hot, super spicy, flavorful with veggies and rice. The shitake mushrooms are a nice touch. The stew is a perfect dish to make you feel good for the rest of the night. 

As I waited for my main dish, Ka Chi served up a variety of complimentary appetizers like: Kimchi, salad, steamed seaweed and veggies, spicy cabbage and spicy potatoes. We also tried Ka Chi's pan-fried and steamed dumplings that were real delicious. On another occasion we tried the fried potato pancake, which I found was nicely cooked and seasoned. It might have been a bit over-fried on one side but nonetheless it was scrumptious. 

Ka Chi can sometimes get busy but the restaurant is large enough to seat all guests so you shouldn't encounter any line-ups. The service is relatively fast for the amount of people it serves and the staff is very polite. This is a great neighborhood restaurant if you're visiting the AGO (Art Gallery Of Ontario) or Chinatown and craving a hearty, reasonably priced Korean meal."}
{"text":"The soon tofu here is better than anything else I've had in Toronto. Would skip out on Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu for Ka Chi's soon tofu."}
{"text":"I wouldn't rate this place with a serious five stars, I just want to let people know that this place is great for homestyle Korean food. I love it. There was a time that I went here at least twice a week because I lived around the corner, the prices were fair and the food was filling and delicious. The soft tofu stew is a must!
The service is fast, to the point. No bullshit. 
There is one female server that is an absolute boss. She's incredible. She chased a drunk homeless man out after he yelled at her. She didn't even flinch. Top notch. 
Oh, and it is super clean in there."}
{"text":"Awesome, nutritious, tasty food. Always fresh and hot. The apps are top notch. The prices are super reasonable. Love it here. Back often."}
{"text":"If you want real Korean food near Bloor West, go to Mr. Yummy in the crossways. Delicious and has been there for years- a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Doesn't have the Kensington Market's excellent Kalbi. Considering that, you're probably better off going to Buk Dong Chung Soon Tofu for your tofu stew and Bulgogi needs.

Since I was already there, I had the Bulgogi. It was alright, but not as good as a short walk away. However, their menu is a lot more extensive. My friend had Buckwheat noodles and enjoyed it. They served everything in metal bowls, so that's some authenticity anybody can appreciate. 

Service was all right but I felt the Kensington one was also more attentive."}
{"text":"Absolutely great Kalbi, best I've had in Toronto. Great sauce, and the best part, great level of char. Went when the Olympics were on their television, and had a great talk with the waiters and waitresses about what was on the tele. 

Portions were huge for my friends Bi Bim Bap and Soup. Easily got a Ban Chan refill, and thanks to the bottles they give you, your practically never run out of water. 

Definitely recommend, but word of warning, the Korea Town Ka chi does not have Kalbi for some reason, so I definitely prefer this one to that one."}
{"text":"Not great but decent for the low price tag. Ka-Chi reminds me of the cheap lunchtime eateries around Seoul where you go in for a quick bite and the surly middle-aged lady with a bad perm hands you your check as she throws down your meal. At least the teeny-bopper servers at Ka-Chi are nice to you.

I've had their mandu, dukbokki, bibimbap, and kimchi jjigae on different occasions. They were exactly what I expected for the price and standard of restaurant. I mean it's not Momofuku for chrissakes.

Main dishes are about $7 and include free side dishes which is cheaper than me schlepping over to PAT Market and buying the ingredients to make the meal at home. 

You're not impressing your dates or looking for a memorable dining experience at Ka-Chi but if you find yourself in K-town looking to fill your gullet on the cheap, this is one option."}

{"text":"In my compartmentalized view of ethnic restaurants, Koreatown is where you go for good Korean food; Chinatown is for Chinese food.

So what's this Korean restaurant doing in Chinatown? Messing up the squares in my neatly-drawn grid, that's what. Shocking but I'm going to say that this outpost of Ka-Chi has a slight edge over its progenitor in Koreatown.  

This location has the exact same menu and even the same cheesy decor (including those gawd-awful copycat Van Gogh renderings) but seems to have fresher, tastier banchan (side dishes) than its K-town counterpart -- perhaps due to higher turnover.

Ka-Chi(natown) obviously attracts more ethnically Chinese customers and for some reason, they ALL order one thing: Pork Bone Soup (PBS). I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone when I pass the two-tops and four-tops, and each table has the same dish. Creepy.

I also find it curious how PBS has become so wildly popular in Toronto. Traditionally, this soup isn't eaten for lunch or dinner in Korea. It's the communal dish you order with your drinking buddies after several rounds of booze, and you go for one last nip of soju (Korean vodka) before heading home--or collapsing in the street, as the case may be.

So, no, I haven't had the PBS yet. I've had the tteok mandu guk* ($7) which was a hot MSG bath of pre-packaged dumplings. Bleh. 

On a recent muggy night, I went for the naeng myun** ($8) which was cool and refreshing, and better than expected for a cheapo Korean joint like Ka-Chi. 

The S.O. likes to get a good dose of the soup sweats with their burbling, hot and spicy budae jjigae*** ($8).

Oh, and if you do go, try to give the tip directly to the staff. On one visit, we saw a crazy dude walk in and swipe some loonies off of a vacated table.

{"text":"I ordered Ka Chi through Foodora and after waiting extra long for my food, I was severely disappointed. I was very pleased that the Foodora delivery person called to notify me that the restaurant was busy and behind so, it was going to be late (he just wanted to make sure I knew it wasn't his fault) - I'm patient so, I didn't mind that but appreciate the call. But as I was eating my kimchi stew, I found what appeared to be some kind of dead wasp in my food. First time I've ever ordered from here and will definitely be the last."}
{"text":"I've been a little confused by the mixed reviews that I've been reading about this place. I've been to this place numerous times and the food and service has been somewhat consistent in my opinion. Service isn't any better or worse than anywhere else in Chinatown (by asian standards).  If anything, I found the food arrived quickly, we were seated fairly quickly, water/tea came quickly, as well as the bill. I am a somewhat impatient person so if I felt that anything is quick by my standards, I doubt anyone else should have a problem.  
If anything, they wait until your dish is ready and bring you a slew of 6 delicious apetizers. Which can be annoying when you are especially hungry!

I always get the pork bone soup. Price is around $6.95 plus tax and tip. The meat is a hit or miss, but more often than not its a hit with tender morsels of pork that is like a piece of heaven in your mouth. Sometimes if you aren't lucky, the meat is a little tougher than usual. In general, it hasn't disappointed me. The soup is very flavourful and tasty.  Always pipping hot when it arrives to your table.

I have also tried other menu items.  The seafood pancake is quite tasty. As well as the korean staple rice patties dish.

Overall, the place is clean and service has been adequate.  

I would definitely go back, esp during the cold winter months. Not sure why the mixed reviews. I have had nothing but good experiences."}
{"text":"Went here today, 
We had the seafood pancake, seafood udon soup and spicy seafood hot pot with sides 
My first Korean experience and it was absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here and we always go to Ka Chi for Korean food.

It's a family restaurant and service is usually as a restaurant, you order, they bring you food.  

One thing about Ka Chi is that they get really whinny about the tips you give or how much you give. They don't go up and beyond for service but get annoyed and will call you on it.
I think it's very rude because tips is something given to you based on your service."}
{"text":"Bummer.  Was excited to find Korean in our area. Total disappointment. If your looking for proper Korean with lots of flavor make the trek to bloor and Christie. You'll save money and eat great food. Food at this place is just bland and expensive :("}
{"text":"Having been to the other location years ago, I thought I would give this location a try.

My craving today - pork bone soup.

I noticed as I perused the menu that the prices went up by $2 to $8.95 since I've been to the last ka chi. 

I was seated immediately. Cup of hot tea in a glass cup came instantly even before I took my coat off and sat down. 

Within minutes of my order, at lightning speed, appetizers and a bowl of rice was served. 

A few minutes following having barely made a dent in my appetizers, the pork bone soup appeared in a stone bowl still sizzling. Bean sprouts and nappa a plenty piled high with a lime on top.

This meal is not for the faint of heart. I started deconstructing my dish using the empty bowl they provided for the bones.

I started with the broth, sipping away in order to reduce the volume to minimize the splash. Once sufficient liquid was drained, I started eating the bean sprouts and nappa lettuce along with the potatoes. I then carefully moved the pork bone piece after draining the liquid into the empty bone bowl. I requested the mandatory soy sauce and drenched the pork bone before pulling off the meat to put it straight into my mouth.

This was repeated until most of the meat was polished off. I along the way scooped some rice to eat with the hot broth.

The prognosis - the soup was piping hot the way I like it, the meat was the fall off the bone tender type, the broth was spicy but flavourful until the last drop. Potatoes were soft and tender with good flavour. Craving satisfied.

Service was excellent. I requested a glass of water and soy sauce , both came right away. 

Ambiance is adequate. The room is bright with two large screen tvs on both sides of the room. Walls are lined with large Van Gogh and other impressionist art reproductions. The place is clean and spacious.

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"That's right! 5 shiny red stars! I love KA-CHI. I brag to peoples about  how it only costs 7 bux for a bowl of rice, a complete small side dish, and a huge hot stone bowl full of meat, egg, and other goodies. 
YEAH - for $7 you get all that! I found KA-CHI in a cold cold Saturday afternoon with a friend. We were walking in the cold, starving and then all of the sudden we smelt heaven in the air, and decided it was coming from across the street. so we went in. the place was PACKED! like really...packed. We were lucky then cuz we didnt have to wait forever for a seat, we got a seat in front of the heater (nice! i was turning blue)! They gave us hot tea, and handed us the menu. Menu looked good- lots of options for foods-sometimes it/s a good thing to have plenty of options. 

So, i ordered the spicy chicken hot stone soup- something like that. The side dishes came, and the food follow. It was good- it was sooo goood! OK-so yes, i was hungry maybe that factored into the equation. but really- i went back back to ka-chi for the 2nd time 2 weeks after in a non-starving mode, i thought it was still so gooood! 

so my bill came up to 7 bux and some change =D i left ka-chi carrying my stomach cuz i was full and satisfied =D 

just to warn, lunch is busy--busy busy... so wait till about after 1ish. it dies down then. it's worth it. you cant get ne better for 7bux. if you think u rather have booster juice for 7 bux- think again and go for a complete meal even more for the same price =D"}
{"text":"We were waiting for last 3 months to be opened and finally came here!
When you come inside, it looks like sports bar because so many TVs are on the wall. We ordered bulgogi and seafood pancake.  I expected a bunch of small dishes first like other Korean restaurants but we were served only kimchi and sweet sour daikon carrot :(. 
Portion of the food and taste were ok but I can cook better at home.  I give you only 2stars because I don't think I would recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"I was a customer of Kachi since they opened on Bloor Street in the 90's.Today I went to their Kensington location and ordered the lunch special Bulgogi platter ($7.95). The photo shows a serving a kimchi accompanying the dish. When the dish arrived, I found kimchi missing. So I asked the waitress for the missing kimchi. Her immediate response: \"it was only a photo... and the price is only six dollars. What do you expect!\". For me eating Bulgogi without kimchi is not my way of enjoying Korean food. So I left."}
{"text":"Servers and staff are super friendly. Great atmosphere. Korean/Pub. However, food is way too salty. I mean it was the last time too but we thought we'd give it another try. Maybe if anyone has suggestions but our go to Kim chi stone fried rice and rice cakes with noodles and it was not good. Too generous on the sauce/salt."}
{"text":"On a cold winters day, the pork bone stew will be the best under 10 dollar meal you will ever get. It will taste just as good every time you go, no matter how often that is."}
{"text":"As a former regular at this Korean restaurant, I was once a fan of the comfort style foods that they offered. From the side dishes to the pork bone soup, the food was savory and tasty. However, after exploring other Korean restaurants, I have found this place to be lacking in service and persistent quality."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty standard; good but not great. Prices are in the $$. The main problem here was that service was a little poor and the bowls in which the miso soup came in was fairly oily which made me wonder about the cleanliness of the place and food in general."}
{"text":"We love this place! Amazing Port Bone Stew. Order one; enough for two people and it's under $10 after tax and tip. There are a few in Toronto. I love the one on St. Andrew Street (just off of Spadina). It's at Kensington Market. I just can't get enough of this stew."}
{"text":"Try Pork Bone stew! Just amazing. Great service and the price is right. I also love the free tea that comes with the dinner/lunch."}
{"text":"I think i found my new favorite place for Kam Ja Tang (KJT). I use to live in RH and would visit the korean restos uptown to midtown. Now that i've moved DT Toronto i discovered this little place. Ive been going to Ka Chi since May frequently and i'm ready to say that this restaurant is pretty consistent with the quality of KJT. I cant say the same for other dishes from this restaurant tho.

I tend to visit this location as i live closer to this one as oppose to the one in korean town. I find that the parking situation is a lot better anyways, as i wouldnt mind driving to koreantown if there was better food there. Really, just a bonus since parking in chinatown can be quite chaotic. I recommend parking in the lot next to the restaurant on St. Andrews its only $2/hr or something ridiculously cheap (i usually walk or stop for take out).

For this restaurant i feel like the service is still decent. The staff is very friendly just not very helpful due to the language barrier but very fast and efficient.

The price for the KJT is approx. $7 and you can pair that with a variety of alcoholic beverages for under $10. There is also the option to pick mild, regular spicy or super spicy.

KJT: 4-5 pieces of pork bone served in the traditional stone bowl with bean sprout at the top and a piece of lime.
A bowl of rice and an empty bowl for your bones.  chili flake filled soup base that is tangy and infused with pork and spices...Voila! amazing!

i think some previous yelper said that the pork bone had no meat on it but i feel like its just random as the resto/chef cant predict which piece would have meat vs. bone.

Everything that ive ordered came out fast and always served with pitcher of Tea/Water and appetizers (6 of them) 

Takeout for my KJT is always in a nice tall tub that is stuffed with 4-5 pieces of pork bone and sometimes i feel like im getting more food when i take it to go.

Other dishes i've tried:
My BF loves the beef fried rice wrapped in eggs ($9) i think it deserves a 3 star for this dish, just taste like beef fried rice that i can make at home doesn't taste as amazing as my bf would tell you if he was writing this review but he loves it a lot and gives it a 5 star.

From time-to-time i order the naeng myung ($8) i think its really good for a hot summer day, ask for vinegar and douse it with mustard!!! yummy! This is a a cold buckwheat noodle served with slices of beef and a hard boil egg. Carrots and cucumber served on the side. Delicious!

seafood pancake ($5) super greasy and starchy, i didnt like it and the hot sauce that it came with was super oily too."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for a quick, authentic Korean lunch.  It's small and kind of cramped (or cozy), as the 1-2 seat tables are very close together, but the staff are friendly, they bring you enough tea/water, the service is quick, and the food is a VERY good value!
I've been to this location, as well as the one near Spadina at least 10 times total.  I usually get a bibimbap with bulgogi or spicy squid - sometimes in a hot stone bowl, sometimes in a regular bowl, depending on my mood.  I often will pig out and ALSO get the hot tofu stew with vegetables.
I almost always go for the seafood pancake appetizer too!

The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the fact that they don't make kalbi (beef ribs), which is one of the dishes I most crave when wanting Korean food."}
{"text":"Having my usual kimchi with pork, same goodness as always.  Try to play a bit less had rock on the air wave."}
{"text":"Ever since our fave Korean restaurant in chinatown  changed ownership and started sucking, we've been searching for a new haunt in the same area.  After trying several dissapointing ones we finally found one tonight. It's located in a split building beside another korean resto. We veered to the left towards Ka Chi cause our little guy likes sushi and they had picture of rolls that lured us in.  

Service for dinner was quick and accurate.  Pork bone soup was stacked and ready to topple over. Broth had strong potato and bean sprout flavouring stewed not just thrown in. Very appetizing. Personally would've like more variety of cracked pepper in there to kick up the broth a notch but it was still very appetizing.  

Tofu bibimbop was surprisingly good as well with fresh cut veggies mixed offered alot of different soft and crunchy texture with refreshing subtle taste.  Between the large portion of the bibimbop and the pork bone soup my husband and I were able to swop portions.  

The green dragon roll was a substantial size.  Didn't blow me away.  Like how they bring the tea in a large pitcher so we don't need to keep asking for refills. Price is incredibly reasonable for 8$+tax per person.

Owners are attentive and personable.  It makes a huge difference.  The other Ka Chi on Dundas is mediocre compared to this one.   Definitely will be reviewing more items on their menu in the future."}
{"text":"It is a great place to go if you want cheap Korean food.
I think I have tried half the menu.  The food is not mind blowing, but it is consistently good.  Some of the dishes can be a little too oily, and you get a no frills set of banchan (side dishes).
Do not come here hoping to experience awesome Korean food.  Come here for no frills Korean food at a very cheap price."}
{"text":"This was my third time here and the food is delicious as always! The first time I came the menu prices were definitely higher than I expected (compared to their old restaurant) but I have great news!!! Their menu prices are now much lower and the food quality is JUST as good if not better than my last visit. AND they now give you 4 side dishes as compared to 2 when they first opened which is totally my jam because Korean food isn't complete without a solid amount of side dishes. Good service and great selection of draft beer"}
{"text":"Just finished a delicious dinner which included spicy beef bibimbap, spicy beef bulgogi, and a seafood pancake.  Our food arrived quickly after we ordered.  The pancake was delicious and crispy. The beef bulgogi was so tender. The spiciness was awesome!  Everyone broke out in a sweat,  but was extremely satisfied with their meal.  Prices were very reasonable since the portions are generous.  I want to go back and try a stew."}
{"text":"Used to love coming to Ka Chi, especially this branch on Dundas. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be returning after tonight.

The Kam Ja Tang is close to tasteless. I could only taste salt. The pork bone taste like poached pork rather than pork stew. 

I will recommend heading to House of Korea near bay and Dundas. They have better food there"}
{"text":"I hit up this spot at least once a week, sometimes more. By far one of the best places in the city to get \"Gamjatong\" or pork bone soup. The other favorite dishes are the soft tofu soups, BiBimBap, and seafood pancakes. But honestly everything on the menu is good. It's definately a very affordable place with just about every dish under $10. During th evenings it's usually very busy but table turnovers are very fast. Great spot to warm up on a cold winter night."}
{"text":"I've never rated any restaurants so bad, however this one provided me with particularly unforgettable experience (in negative terms) and I could not but do so this time. 

Yes, it now has improved its interior and so on, but the owner should have spent his/her money more wisely as the restaurant operation (which is very fundamental to any restaurants) seems now totally out of control. I've waited for longer than an hour and was told by waitress that the kitchen had not even started preparing for my order yet. And it wasn't just me, as I saw they kept delivering wrong orders to the table next to mine, and the folks over there were losing their as patience as well. I ended up getting just one dish out of three that I ordered at 1 hour mark, and had no choice but to cancel the rest of the orders and eat elsewhere. No wonder my Sunday evening was totally wasted. 

It might sound harsh, but a restaurant like this should learn its lesson and I recommend the other Yelp users not to go there to give the owner that lesson. Period."}
{"text":"I'm Korean Canadian and live in bloor west. Was looking forward to a good Korean resto in our neighbourhood. Unfortunately disappointed. The food is not authentic Korean. It's some kind of weird fusion probably catering to non-Koreans who don't know any better. It's too bad because authentic Korean is savoury, complex and delicious. 

The prices are at least 30% higher than any authentic Korean shop in k-town or even Mississauga. The portions are 50% smaller. It seems they hire the least qualified servers, same as at their old Bathurst location. Korean restaurant servers are usually students who hustle. Consistently this place has the slowest laziest ones. 

The meat in the porkbone soup is this gross greyish color with no flavouring and broth is watery. The bulgogi meal is like a strange Chinese stir fry with little meat. The chicken fried rice is flavoured w black pepper and is not Korean. The tofu soup is mediocre at best compared to other k-town shops and will leave you hungry.  

Not sure if the food recipes are intentional to cater to what they wrongly think non- Koreans would like or if the cook is just really bad. Even though it's just a block walk from my home I'll probably have to drive out 20min for cheap, authentic k food elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's not five stars like New York Times five stars, it's five stars because it delivers consistent food at super cheap prices. There is actually another Ka Chi in Chinatown. The default dish to order is the pork bone soup (Kam Ja Tang), and you can have it non-spicy right up to super spicy; it costs $6 or $7, and you get a bowl of rice, a big bowl of soup with potatoes, kimchi, bean sprouts and of course pork bones with some meat attached. It tastes like it sounds like. In winter time I will call ahead for pick up a couple of times a month. The other menu items are decent but what's the point?

There is another place called Thumbs-Up across the street; it used to be our favourite for Kam Ja Tang but they seem to have fewer ingredients in the soup nowadays (like no bean sprouts or something) and the meat is sometimes tough and the soup thinner, like maybe it wasn't simmered long enough. But we will give Thumbs-Up another chance, as they have served us well for many a year..."}
{"text":"Pork bone soup is tasteless...feels like they just threw the bones in the soup right before serving...would not go back here for the soup . service is okay but they didn't know anything about the plates ..kept going back to the kitchen to ask.. there are better Korean restaurants around there for sure"}
{"text":"Found a dishwashing wire in the pork bone soup. 

I came with friends and ordered a regular spicy pork bone soup with NO DISHWASHING WIRE. When I found the foreign object in the pork bone, I called the waitress over and I honestly just wanted to express my frustration. When I asked the waitress about it, waitress turned around and asked me \"what do you want us to do about it\"

In the end, the manager gave me that soup for free; but there was just something deeply unsatisfying about the whole experience, from the unsanitary food to the horrendous service.

Do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"I'd go with a zero star rating if possible. I ordered the non-spicy pork bone soup and somehow, they managed to bring me the spicy version. Yesterday, one of my friends visited the same restaurant and ordered pork bone soup,. and he received a one that was not fully cooked. There was this male waiter who was not so friendly after we pointed out his mistakes, and responded to me in a sarcastic manner."}
{"text":"The place itself is really nice as it had a bar/western dining hall kind of experience, and had tvs on walls playing sports. The food, on the other hand, were very average and kind of tasteless after a while. My friend and I got the spicy rice cake and we both gave up eating it halfway through.

The server who served us was kind of rude, as she bought us the bill when we didn't request it and we have not even finished eating yet. A meh experience overall."}
{"text":"Great food for the price. This is a must for anyone who wants to get stuffed on a budget. Pork bone soup is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Unlimited banchan with really lovely tofu. They actually run out often. Hilarious interior with two very large LED screens: great for watching the game with friends and getting caught up. The servers are always incredibly attentive and the place is clean. The food is so tasty and the portions are substantial.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I like the food, new location is nice.... but the owner needs to chill out.

I was there with a group of people, one of who is Korean, and he was telling us what the owner was saying out loud (to himself?) and to the staff, dude needs anger management.

If they have the Dyson fan going, ask not to be seated near it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places in the Market! The owners are so nice and the food is delicious. #64 is the beef rib soup is one of my favourites. The broth is incredibly flavourful! I highly recommend this place. It's not expensive and the customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"I had the pork bone soup and seafood pancake here and both were really good! The servers were also very friendly and attentive. The side dishes were okay but hey it's complimentary so I can't complain!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty much empty at 2pm.

Ordered a bibimbap, which was pretty good (slightly above average).

We also ordered the season pancake, which was a pleasant surprise.  It is quite large, enough for 4 people to share as an appetizer.  It also had big pieces of calamari.  Would definitely order this again. 

Service is attentive and fast.

The place itself seemed quite clean and well lit."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, the place is clean...I would recommend the dumplings and the korean pancake! delicious yo!"}
{"text":"Friendly servers - even though they struggled with English, they still recommended dishes when asked. 

I ordered the pig bone soup - large portions, tender meat, lots of soup and lots of veggies on top - definitely a fan! Couldn't finish it so I took it home - and it was still amazing a day later.  

Also, we shared pancakes (the ones with seafood and rice cake) - they received mixed reviews: they looked kind of burnt and didn't taste too good. Tasted better with the sauce but it's not something that i would order again. 

Would definitely come again if i'm in the area - wouldn't really trek down from uptown for it though :)"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on my way to Scotiabank theatre.  Tried the other location on Dundas W but wasn't too impressed, but want to give this location a try after reading some positive reviews on Yelp.  Ordered pork bone stew which has always been typical choice upon my first visit.  The stew comes with generous amount of meat and lots of Korean spice on top.  The broth is savoury and flavourful, but not spicy at all even though I ordered extra spicy.  The taste is more flavourful than a couple of joints nearby my place but definitely not the best gamjatang I've had in Toronto.  Spicy tofu stew with seafood on the other hand, is very tasty and flavourful.  The sides taste kind of bland which is a let down, but surely they don't skimp on the portion.

The dining area and washroom are generally clean and service is efficient, which really is all I ask for around the area.  Overall 4/5."}
{"text":"Now, this was my first time eating at a Korean restaurant, so I can't really tell you if this was \"authentic Korean food\" or \"just like they make it in Seoul\", but I can tell you that it was delicious. We ordered one of their tasty seafood pancakes, and also a beef and rice dish. The beef and rice came first, and was accompanied by a host of side dishes, known as banchan. I didn't really know what to expect, but the beef was perfect. The sauce was light, but still tasty, and I absolutely loved all of the side dishes. Next came the seafood pancake, which was served with with their spicy soy sauce. I've never had anything like it. It was incredibly yummy and tasted great with the soy sauce. The service was very friendly and attentive, and the food was brought out very quickly. I would recommend this restaurant in a heartbeat, and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Ka Chi for quite a few years now.  This Bloor St location was the original and the first one I ever went to.  I've since tried the one on Dundas, as well as the one closer to Kensington Market.  I still find it more of a treat to go to this one, especially since its move to a larger location with a patio and draught beer/full bar.

The pork bone soup (gam ja tang) was what brought me here, and it has never disappointed. It's a slightly lighter broth than, say, the opaque always-stewing broth from Owl of Minverva, I like that there is more napa cabbage and sprouts in it, and the pork has always been fall off the bone and requires very little effort to eat. The portions and banchan (complimentary sides that come with the food like kimchi, japchae, etc. ... whatever else they've made recently) are always too much food for me.  It's definitely a 2 or 3 meal-er for me.

I also love their kimchi and beef fried rice.  So flavourful. Though it can be a tad on the oily side.  I endeavor to try their noodle dishes at least once.  And maybe one day, I'll consider some of their other stews...haha.. but in the mean time, I'm not yet ready to leave my gam ja tang order alone yet.

I went back recently for some late night take out, and while I was waiting at the bar, I got to chatting with the person behind it.  Turns out, he's the owner.  Nice and friendly guy.  Gave me a complimentary sample of beer while I waited for my take out to be ready.  While we were chatting, he was still directing his staff and greeting everyone who came in to be seated.  It's nice to see the owner not only care, but also work at the restaurant from time to time.  Food is consistent, and tasty.  Can't really ask for more, except maybe more friends to go with me so I can taste more things at once.

Definitely looking forward to going back... Maybe even today :)"}
{"text":"I read the reviews for this place before heading there and was very disappointed. I am not sure how other reviewers rate standard to really great Korean but this is not one of them. I have been to a few Korean places in the city and I feel that Ho Su on Queen st.  is better than this place. The interior atmosphere was lacking, plus I guess they had just cleaned and everything smelled of strong ammonia. I wish I had left at that moment before having a chance to even take a seat but I wanted to give it a chance. The food was luke warm and basic at best, I left feeling unwell and couldn't even stomach the leftovers I had packed up thinking I may need a quick lunch option for the following day. Although the staff were very polite and courteous, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Ka Chi has become my regular spot for Korean food. Yes, there is better Korean restaurant in Toronto. 

BUT, the location is great, just a short walk from my couch. It`s cheap, dinner for 2 can range between $20-40, tax and tip included. And, the food is decently yummy. My fav dish is the tofu stew. Their bibimbop is nothing to brag about, but it`s decent.

There is not much of an ambiance. It`s really a casual place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Ka Chi doesn't look like your typical K-town restaurant - the place is huge and has an impressively stocked bar. It also seems more geared to the younger crowd. 

The food was okay. I ordered the Kam Ja Tang and was surprised to find that there was lime in it - LIME. Korean food generally does not use citrus flavours so I found the combination quite odd and overpowering. It would have tasted so much better without the lime! That being said, the chicken bulgoggi hot plate was pretty amazing!! I would have given fewer stars had it not been for their chicken bulgoggi - the flavour was perfectly smokey, sweet and spicy at the same time. I've been to restaurants where they just drowned the chicken in gotchujang (korean hot sauce), but this was much more masterfully prepared! They could provide some more banchan (side dishes). 

Service was just okay. Servers took long to take our order. They forgot our beer and had to be reminded. Food took long to come out. They were all polite and friendly though. 

I will give this place another go, but I will definitely not be ordering the Kam Ja Tang!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this Ka Chi chain. the pork bone soup taste just not the same!

I wanted to say this for a long time: Please give us some real chopsticks!"}
{"text":"Came here at the insistence of one of my friends who is a bonafide regular. I found that compared to the korean restaurants that I've been to in both koreatowns it is fairly average. The pricing of the menu reflects the much larger options available to diners as it is pricier but much larger than some of the smaller korean joints down near Bathurst.  

That being said I feel that simplicity in cuisine is much more valuable than the sheer number of options. I find that the sheer number of dishes offered result in a watered down version of the core dishes of toronto korean cuisine.

Solid 3 star."}
{"text":"This location's Ka Chi quite possibly has the best pork bone soup in the city (at least downtown).  I've tried a handful of other places that serve PBS but always come back to Ka Chi.  The portion of pork bone is generous, and the broth is perfectly seasoned and accompanied by kim chi, bean sprouts and potatoes.  I like  regular spicy, but if your spicy tolerance is low, then get non-spicy or mild.

The last item on the menu - kim chi rice with chicken is also very delicious.

The people who work here are young and always provide service with a smile.

It's a casual joint, with plenty of seating. 

Having pork bone soup is one of the reasons I like cold weather. I can always count on Ka Chi to warm me up."}
{"text":"The place has a weird feel.  It is a big room, with many empty tables (nothing on them) and tvs on the wall.  The chicken bibimbap was disappointing.  It is described as chicken with steamed vegetables on rice, but there are no steamed vegetables!  Just shredded carrots, radish, bean sprouts and lettuce.  The chicken portion was very small.  And it was overpriced, I was looking forward to the place opening but I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"My go-to place for Korean cuisine since it's conveniently located in Chinatown.  Service is friendly and quick in a clean and casual atmosphere.   Great if you want to order and eat in under an hour without any fuss.

Ka Chi serves Korean comfort food at very reasonable pricing and good portions, plus they provide unlimited side dishes without batting an eye (just ask and you shall receive).  They are known best for their pork bone soup which I've ordered many times and probably one of the tastiest I've had.

This visit I had the kalbi ribs which weren't the best I've had, but they were still tasty and flavourful.  
Kimchee and tofu stew was served piping hot with a nice spicy broth. Tofu was silky and smooth which was great to offset the spicy kimchee and broth. Definitely a must try if you're looking for a vegetarian stew option."}
{"text":"Wanted to send an update - though everyone's meals were yummy - we all experienced a little tummy trouble with some time spent in the bathroom the next day if you know what I mean ... Not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm very picky with Korean food but this place is sooooo good. I tried spicy kalbi, regular kalbi with cold noodle and spicy udon and all of them were so good! Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"First of all, I've been to the old ka chi place many many times in the past and enjoyed the comfort food they served every single time.  This new location is Definitely not the same owner!!!

The food was super salty.  I'm used to the saltiness of Korean food, after all it's this ethnic food all about, spicy, salty and hot.  But this time it's way too salty for us.  Pork bone soup was such an disappointment.  Meat was too tough to chew.  The potato wasn't even cooked through so it was still cold inside.

Worst of all, servers and owner were so unprofessional in dealing with questions/comments as if they didn't really care.  Hate the snobbish attitude. 

Would definitely not go back or recommend it to anyone.  I wish I could give it zero star."}
{"text":"Very pleasant evening spent with family, delicious appetizers, steamed dumplings and pancake, mains , served on hot cast iron pans, great gin and tonic, deserts delicious,, great service, knowledgable staff, welcome to the neighbourhood, definitely will be back,   ReasoNbly priced"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Korean cuisine so it would not be fair for me to comment on the food - it was good enough. 

I would like, however, mention that the music was so loud that the four of  us could barely hear each other and we ended up with headaches the following day (and no, it wasn't a hangover)."}

It was a cold day and my sister and I were craving Hot Pot. I found a decent looking place on Yelp, so we decided to head to Chinatown where it was located. Even after calling to see it was open, when we got there we realized it was not a Hot Pot place, but a Chinese Bakery. I have no idea what happened there but long story short, we were already in Chinatown and hungry so we decided to try the much famous Ka-Chi that was near by.

Walking in, I was surprised to see how clean and bright the restaurant was. First of all, Ka Chi did not feel like a Korean restaurant (decor, lighting and layout) plus for a place located in Chinatown half basement, it was exceptionally clean. I don't expect much going into Korean restaurants, unless I am going to a drinking place where food can be mediocre but alcohol makes up for it. It was quite busy once we got there, but we got seats right away infront of this giant TV screen, YAY samsung!!

They have a very long menu and it seems very extensive. But when you look at each pages, it's basically same dish but in varieties of meat and vegetables. They seem to specialize in Bi-Bim-Bab, Various Meat dishes and Spicy soup (in general)

I know people say Korean restaurants give you free appetizers but these are actually sidedishes meant to be consumed during meal, not as an appetizer (although I do pick at it prior to arrival of my food cause I am usually starving!). They gave us 2 types of KimChi, Sweet potato, Seaweed, Stir fried Zucchini and Jelly noodles. None of the side dishes were that good- both KimChi tasted very bland, Seaweed dish was very sour and other 3 dishes were just nothing special.

Ordered: Pork bone soup 2/5

*Pork bone stew served with rice and side dishes for $7.95
*My sister decided to order the Pork bone soup since everyone raved about it so much.
*I personally don't like Porkbone soup cause I had it way too many times back in my university years when my guy friends ordered it all the time to eat it while drinking soju
*3-4 big pieces of porkbone with potatoes in a spicy broth
*There is a lot of meat on the bones and bean sprouts on the side
*Have to work with your chopstick to get the meat off
*Soup was little too mild for my taste
*Very distinct pork smell to this dish (if you don't really like pork, this might be a turn off)

Ordered: Spicy Bulgogi & Squid on Stone Plate 4/5

*Stir fried beef and squid in spicy sauce served with rice and side dishes for $11.95
*Lately, I've been obessed with Spicy squid and Milkshake (random, i know)
*Big portion with lots of meat and squid on sizzling stone plate
*This only looks very spicy, the color of this dish is very deceiving
*I found it to be a little too sweet near the end
*Lots of cabbage pieces, green & red pepper and onions
*Very good with rice and could be shared between 2 people
*I want to try other stone plate dishes next time

Ordered: Seafood Pancake 5/5

*Seafood pancake with shrimp, squid and vegetables for $6.95
*This is a must order everytime I go to Korean restaurants because it's one of my favorite dishes
*They make this really well here with little flour and lots of seafood which makes it super crispy
*Dip this in the soy sauce they give you on the side and this can be eaten alone or with rice
*Seafood pancake is good for sharing if ordered as an appetizer
*This was one of the best seafood pancakes I had so far in Canada
*Must order when going to Ka Chi if you love seafood pancakes

Summary: Overall the service was decent and I loved how clean the restaurant is. The food is above average although I think dishes can be hit or miss depending on what you order but I will def go back to this place."}
{"text":"I love Korean food and pork bone soup is one of my favourite dish to try in different places and I like the gamjatang in Kachi. It comes out overpiled, well-cooked pork bones, mix of kimchi and cabbages, bean sprout topped off with a slice of lime. It was juicy, flavorful , rich and tasted like a real soup ( instead of just spicy oily water I had at other restaurants). The kimchi fried rice in a stone pot was a tid tad oily and bibimbap was decent."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a million times and recognize it by the bird logo. The bibimbap is excellent for only $8.95. It's piping hot and stays that way esp. in the stone bowl. The restaurant is kind of stuffy with all kinds of smoky food smells coming out of the kitchen and the place is complete with fluorescent lighting (ugh). Otherwise, good cheap eats."}
{"text":"Food quality some good some not amazing, price not bad, customer service very good.

I went to this venue on 2 occasions last week, ordering a different thing each time: soup the first time, and chirashi sushi the second.

Their beef bone soup is their specialty, and that I did enjoy very much-so. Even more-so, I enjoyed all of the salad type of items that came with the soup on the side.

Keeping in mind that this is a Korean restaurant, taking a chance with ordering sushi is always a gamble. In this case, it didn't work out so well, as the quantity and quality weren't great by any means.

M'lady, whom I took to this venue for my second visit, wasn't impressed with the veggie dumplings she ordered, as she felt their taste was not very pleasant.

The servers at this venue are very attentive, always there every time you need anything.

All-in-all, since I found that this venue had at least one dish that I quite enjoyed, I'd probably only return to this venue if it were for that specific dish."}
{"text":"On my first official night out to Koreatown, we had to make the pilgramage to Ka Chi, a well known food establishment for great and affordable korean eats.

They have a good selection menu, with various stews, soups and entrees - all Korean of course!  I was taken back at the quantity of food the partons would recieved at the cheap prices.

I ordered based on the suggestion of my date to get the spicy beef and soft tofu stew.  We shared pan fried dumplings.  My date got the squid and vegetable bulgogi.  All the dishes were excellent. I could not stop eating the dumplings. Service was quick.  The meal was perfect for the rainy weather that was outside that night.

I definitely have to come back and try out the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Really honest, simple and authentic Korean food. Of all the Ka Chi locations around Toronto (we've tried 3), this is by far the best one. They have kept their quality since moving locations (across the street and further east, across from Honest Eds). The portions are smaller, but the prices are still reasonable. Patio is also a nice touch in the summer time. 

I always get the spicy beef bulgogi on a hot pan. I eat half there with rice, then take the other half home and mix it up with some ramen noodles for dinner the next day! YUMMY! ;)"}
{"text":"I was finally able to visit the third Ka-chi location in old Chinatown.  This location is very similar to the Bloor location and has the same vibe.  The food is top-notch and super yummy.  The side dishes is what makes this place, so much variety.

Service is great in true Ka-chi fashion.  Prices are super affordable just like the other locations.

I will definitely be back if I am in the area!"}
{"text":"When it's cold out, I often crave Korean food.
This spot is pretty busy and reasonably priced.

Bibimbap is alright... nothing spectacular.
Pork bone soup is popular and one of the better dishes here.
I was pleasantly surprised by the seafood pancake.
It's a bit crispier and greasier than other places with large bits of seafoody goodness."}
{"text":"Food was not authentic but still we enjoyed so that's 1 star there. We were seated near where the stairs that leads to the restroom. We cannot help it but we could smell the \"bathroom air freshener\" the entire time we were there that really lowered my friend and I's appetite. Not just that, 
Service was terrible. Took VERY long time for them to come take our order so we just wrote down on our own in the order sheet that the guy left on our table with menu. Also, We were served water cups and a bottle to fill it on our own but when the bottle for empty, no one came to fill it not even that guy who was serving or the lady who was running around. We asked the lady to bring us small plates, took her like 10 min for her to bring them out. She came out to give us plates after we kinda purposely looked at her and she must have sensed and realized that we asked for them. I would not go back to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Overcrowded and OVERTATED.
sure, the food is quite good, but of the dishes that I had here before (dolsot bibimbap, yukgaetang, bulgolgi and squid stir fry, mandu) I can't see what makes this restaurant distinguishable among others. service is OK but not the friendliest. don't expect to sit and chat either, you'll be out the door about the same time it takes for the food to get to your table, which is very quick."}
{"text":"I love Ka Chi, it's always kinda been my go to place in KTown for YEARS.

They've completely renovated now though to keep up with the times I assume. The food hasn't changed though, and it shouldn't, because it's pretty damn good!

My favourite dishes to get is the kimchi fried rice with beef in a stone bowl, their galbi ribs and my number one pick, is the spicy rice cakes ... BUT, with ramen noodles. I can't even explain how delicious it is! 

If you're looking for a good, hearty sometimes greasy Korean dish, Ka Chi is your place to go. It has never failed me!!"}
{"text":"Had the Hot Stone Pot Bibimbap with Bul Go Gi

Just a mild touch heat, really good. Came with 4 side dishes, not in the photo.

I will return."}
{"text":"Used to go here when it was just a small little place, now they are newly renovated to look almost like a hip bar.

Besides the renovations, the food is still the same which is a good thing! Very tasty Korean food, and usually the only place I can fully trust when it comes to good food at KTown.

It's a little more pricey than other restaurants on the Ktown strip, but it's totally worth it! Excellent service too! I suggest the galbi ribs and the spicy rice cakes with ramen noodles! It's to die for!

They will only split the bill for you when it's a table of 4 or more people, be prepared!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here. We got the the steamed veggie dumplings and tofu bibimbap. The dumplings were delicious and it came with 10 which I felt was a hefty portion for 2 people. Bibimbap was alright, nothing special. I would recommend adding an egg on top. The atmosphere was nice, I liked the quirky art. The service was fast, efficient and friendly which I appreciated. I definitely think this place has stepped up its game compared to previous reviews, I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great, delicious, traditional Korean food! However, their service is TERRIBLE and SUB-PAR.

I ordered the bibimbap with beef on a hot plate. Stupendous! I would highly recommend their bibimbap on a hot plate vs. a regular plate - more textured and crunchy! The portions were fair, the beef was savoury, and the side dishes they gave were fantastic! My favourites are the kim chi and bean sprouts, hands down!

However, the service we received that night was HORRIBLE. We were seated and waited about 20 minutes for the server to come back. Ridiculous! We had to go up to the counter to ask for water and give our orders. It wasn't even busy! There were less than 8 other patrons in the entire restaurant. After waiting a about 12 minutes, our food arrived - we never saw our server again. He did not refill our waters, teas, or asked how we were doing. The other female server seemed to be ignoring us - not like we ordered alcohol or anything, it was just my friend and I!

During the meal, we yet again had to go up to the counter to ask for a water refill. Needless to say, we did not tip that night. This was surprising as they usually have good to above-average service. Perhaps, the servers were overworked or were having a bad night. My friend, who has been here multiple times, stated that this place was much worse than she remembered compared to a couple years ago.

Still, this experience has made me reconsider coming back here. I may just go to the other Ka Chi near Dundas and Beverly, or go to Nakwon a few minutes away."}
{"text":"The best Korean restaurant in Korean town or downtown Toronto in general. Their menu is great and always come back to hear when I crave authentic Korean food. Their interior is huge and their patio is amazing. I love their kimchi fried rice and spicy rice cakes. Cooked with the perfect amount of spiciness and flavour. Their soju is not as good as before and their rice wine is mediocre. But I always come back for their food as I have tried many other Korean restaurants in k-town and they are pretty average compared to kachi. 

5 stars for food and service. Even when I come here on days when it's packed, the servers always greet us and seat us as soon as possible. Ordering is quick and easy. You don't have to wait very long for Your meal and drinks to arrive upon ordering."}
{"text":"Came for a late dinner, staff was friendly and accommodating, with a takeout order when they were about to close. 

Ate in and our group ordered a pork bone soup, tofu kimchi soup, and I ordered a tofu and beef.

To someone that's been to their fair share of Korean places, the food was mediocre as the beef did not live up in quality, and the side dishes were limited. 

Food is a two star but added one star for the sports bar decor and great wait staff."}
{"text":"Ordered through JustEat. Gam Ja Tang (Pork Bone soup) is my absolute favourite and my go too. Both my friend and I ordered the same thing along with some appys. Since PBS is made with pork neck, a big portion of the meat is just bone so restaurants normally give you at least 4 pieces of pork neck with the soup. The containers for take out is usually pretty big in order to fit the pieces however with Ka Chi we were disappointed to find only 2 pieces of pork bone in our soup. The pieces had very little meat too so it felt like I was eating just soup with rice. 

As for the taste, it was mediocre. It actually made me kinda of sick which hasn't happened in all my years of eating this. Anyways, over all I would not recommend if you're a PBS lover like me. 

PBS is not a dish you can skimp out on and pork neck/spine is a pretty inexpensive cut so needless to say the cheap portions feels like a rip off for customers."}
{"text":"Ka Chi is another excellent Korean restaurant in Chinatown on Spadina approximately a 5 minute walk from Dundas and Spadina.

Excellent food and service - I would recommend the pork bone soup here, the seafood omelette, the Kim Chi fried rice, and any of their skillets.

It is particularly spicy for the average spice consumer but is worth every bead of sweat.  I normally come here during the winters as the summers are too hot for me and this spice level - if you like it, by all means go for it!

Alternatively for a lower spice level, please refer to my review on Owl of Minerva which is walking distance away."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat K-food in Chinatown, Toronto! (previously it was Nak-won across the street)

Food is tasty! Ive tried the Kam ja tang, dol sot bimbimbop, soon tofu, spicy squid and bulgogi, and the rice cake with spicy bulgogi. (The kimchi fried rice was only ok though the picture made it look better than it really is.) You can probably play pin the tail on the menu and order something decent!

The side dishes change from time to time but are different than the \"norm\" and homestyle. Tastes good.

The wait staff are attentive and friendly.. and the place is very clean and upscale? ( not words I would usually use to describe a place in chinatown)

Hope they keep this up!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a few days ago and ordered the Kim Chi stew with pork and sausage. I eat quite a lot of Korean food but i'm really picky with my kim chi and how it's fermented. The Kim Chi stew I had was really good. It was spicy with flavor (not the painful spicy).

The only thing I was not too happy about was the service, it took a really long time to flag down the waiter to get seated, it took even longer to have my order taken and even the food took a while. But I guess that's what happens when a restaurant is really crowded. 

I would give it 4 stars for the food but 2 stars for the service. (That's why I gave it 3 stars overall)"}
{"text":"The Ka Chi franchise is pretty solid if you're looking for Korean food and have no idea where to start. Kam Ja Tang (pork bone soup) is always yummy on a cold day and my favourite part about this Ka Chi is the outdoor patio. There aren't too many places in the Annex where you can enjoy Korean food outdoors (I think Mom's is the only other place) and their ambiance with the string lights outside is really cute. I would say their soups and rice are good but their dukboki (spicy rice cakes) are really lacklustre and watery (so I'm taking away one star). If you're hitting up Ka Chi, definitely go for a soup or rice dish and pass on the dukboki (Joon's, which is down the street, is better for rice cake dishes like duk galbi)."}
{"text":"The first impression you get of this Ka Chi is that it is very modernistic, and the building is nicely decorated as well as clean and taken care of.

The servers were friendly, and were not shy to have a few laughs with my friends and I. Service was prompt and food was delivered at a reasonable time. Side dishes were delivered almost immediately when requested.

My friends and I ordered the bibimbap with spicy chicken, soy bean stew with tofu, rice cake with beef, pork bone stew (Kam Ja Tang) and a couple of rice dishes. They were all delicious and very well-cooked."}
{"text":"This is one of my must-go Korean restaurants in downtown Toronto!  I've always ordered #94 on the menu, which is the soft tofu stew with Kimchi, dumpling and pork.  It is addictive!  The service is quick and they let you order another round of side dishes.  Overall I am very satisfied with this place, except that the price has gone up a lot - a bit pricey now."}
{"text":"I've never been to Ka Chi's older location, but this one is quite nice.  It has a modern decor with lots of space that stands out among the usually cramped tables of most Annex restaurants, let alone a Korean place. 

I had the pork bone soup, where the soup base tasted good and had decent amounts of pork.  I'm not sure how they cut the bones though, as there was a lot of floating bone particles that I found myself spitting out that was annoying...really annoying."}
{"text":"It was so-so. I will try a little harder next time to find a better Korean restaurant in Toronto the next time.
I think I may have only noticed 3 Korean restaurants in all of K-town, which looked much more like it should have been called China town instead. I had the white hot pot with veggies and added Kimchi. The side dishes were fresh and delicious (Kimchi, bean sprouts, potatoes, soft tofu). The Kalbi was so fatty, not a good cut of the meat and the BBQ sauce was a bit bland or it hadn't been marinated long enough. My favorite Korean food is either in Korea or Sammi's in Troy, Michigan. I am not greatly fond of having to write down my own order and taking it up to the counter, they had some 4-5 people working at the back counter and none of them could manage to take our order, really? We had to go up to the counter to pay, thought how ridiculous is this place, so damn lazy!! I will remember not to come back to this place the next time I am Toronto."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. A great restaurant in the village. Very reasonably priced except for the alcohol."}
{"text":"Really good prices same as food. Maybe 'Korean bbq' wasn't the best idea but everything else was delicious. My favorites are stir fried noodles and rice cake! Whenever I was there the staff was friendly always helpful and well informed.
I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I had my first bulgogi here and I haven't looked back since. This is a great place to introduce people to Korean Food. I took my pretty picky Father here and he loved it. Though I do prefer the other places in K-town because you get more for your money, this place is still up there for me. As mentioned above my go-to is and forever will be spicy beef bulgogi . Also you can't ever go wrong with a kimchi pancake to share!

This location is quite big so if you're looking for a place for 10 people it's totally doable here. Only thing is they do not take reservations on weekend so watch out for that!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!!

The decor: I'ts okay, it's nothing superb but it's very clean and nice. 4/5. 
Service: I'm surprised with how friendly the staff was. Our server was pretty shy and it was really endearing XD They were also very polite and informative. 5/5/

Food: Oh. my. gosh. 
I got the \"normal spicy\" pork bone soup and it was phenomenal. I usually don't like pork but I saw that this was very recommended so I tried it. 
It was so good. The serving was huge, so big that I couldn't finish it! The pork was falling off its bone, so tender and amazing. I used chopsticks to simply lift the bone off, it was that easy! Not hard/dirty to eat at all. The bean sprouts and cabbage on top was wonderfully spiced - it wasn't too spicy, in my opinion. I don't eat spice that much, so if it's okay for me it should be for you :)
The side dishes were very good too. I in particular liked the noodles & the potato carrot stew & seaweed salad. Very delicious! 

Then I had some of my friend's food... First I stole a bit of the Tteokbokki (hot and spicy rice cake) from a friend. He said his mouth was burning, but it was not spicy at all haha! He doesn't eat spice often so perhaps that's why ;D It was really chewy and delicious, but the flavour is a bit flat. I wouldn't personally get it.

I also ate a bit of potato pancake. YUM! It was a little bit too greasy but ah it's still not bad :D

Then. I had some bibimbap... Amazing. The rice was crisp on the bottom, the bulgogi was not over-seasoned, and the fried egg on top had a perfect yolk.

I am so pleased with the food here!


Price: AMAZING! I paid $10 for my meal, tax and tips included. So worth it.
I would definitely come here again for the awesome food!!"}
{"text":"Since moving to the Kensington market 4 years ago, I have probably eaten here more then any other place in the area. 

The Beef and Tofu Stew is pure comfort food satisfaction! Rich and warm and a little bit spicy. Perfect on a cold winter day.  

I love their Bulgogi which has a nice hint of sweetness  You can get it with a side of rice for the full on meat experience, but it's also great in the BiBimBap which is full of veggies and actually feels pretty healthy."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Ka Chi many times on Foodora. I usually get either the pork bone soup, the spicy fish stew with seafood and vegetables, or the hoe dup bap. The food is always flavourful and the quality has been consistent every time.

On one occasion, I had placed an order through Foodora as usual and the takeout containers with soup in them had spilled all over the bag. I called Ka Chi and they resolved the issue right away by personally delivering the food.

The food is great, but the service is even better!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite place to eat at Spadina Chinatown.  Fast food, good price, good service. Side dishes are not as good as some other more authentic Korean place, but free refills is often offered.

Usually order the spicy pork bone soup, the seafood pancake is good as well.

Overall a very nice place to hang out and grab something simple to eat while you are in the Chinatown area."}
{"text":"Overpriced food at an expensive price. The service was slow even though it was not very busy. It was during the lunch rush. I had to add a lot of hot sauce into my \"spicy\" chicken stone pot. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their pork bone soup. Lots of bean sprouts on top and no potato so it's not too filling. It came with rice and banchans. 

I enjoyed it better on the patio, too. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"SCARY place!!!! It was our first time to try the food here. The food was normal. I was ok with them but the scary thing happened during we were having our dinner. There was an old Chinese lady came in and she ordered a dish of appetizer. I saw in the beginning that she asked the waiter if the dish comes with small side dishes. The waiter said YES with nodded ! With confusing face!!! I didnt they understood each other because the lady couldn't speak English well. When the food came, ya for sure, she asked for side dishes that don't come with it 
Just few second, the owner came ( I'm not sure he is the owner but he dressed up with different cloth) He said the old lady had to pay for side dishes if she wanted. She refused and asked for free! The owner guy yelled at her. She got ready to leave. The owner pointed the finger to her and yelled at her again \"GET OUT! DON'T EVEN COME AGAIN!\"  and many many rude words  
I'm not good at English either but I understand English. That old lady looked weird a bit but I don't think the restaurant should do like this. Service is your main work! Why don't try to be polite as much as you could? 
Ps. One of my friends came here too. She told me on the day she came, the owner yelled at the waiter very loud, scared her! Is this a restaurant ???"}
{"text":"Can I still do a review if I didn't eat the food? 

Went to this ka chi first by mistake when meeting some friends after volleyball.  Seemed like this is an older (first?) ka chi than the next one I went to.

Place still seemed dirty, but it was relatively filled with people of all ages.

Staff seemed helpful but wasn't there long enough to gauge..."}
{"text":"I went here with friends after a horrible showing at our vball games.

The place has an alright setting, and is more spacious than you would realize from outside!

The food and service though were where things kind of declined.  When I got there most of my friends were there, and the place was pretty empty besides us (one other group).

A key ingredient to great service is your glass of water.  A waiter who seamlessly keeps your glass full, like an endless well, is a great waiter because they are taking care of such a simple detail, and allowing you to focus your time on conversation or enjoying the food.

However, for us, after the initial serving of bottles (self serve your own glasses) the bottles were never really replenished even after we requested it.  So first fail.

The second came at the serving of food.  I can say that my food was good, but it was, IMHO, a simple dish...curried chicken and rice. And for me it was a great meal at a decent price.

But! ( you knew there was one!)  My friend ordered some crazy pig bone soup dish....I can't remember it nut it was intense and overflowing...so much that they spilt it all over him...hot soup...(thank god we were in our beach gear still...not really but I'm trying to be glass half full here).  

While they didn't offer any additions or reductions in cost they also didn't up their service for my friend.  Poor guy didn't get his utensils, they wouldn't bring him more water or tea...it seemed like they were purposely ruining his night.  

So overall, I guess its the luck of the draw if you are that guy who the staff decides to really focus their bad service on.  In a group setting, while it is entertaining, it brings the total ambience down.

With some more work on the service, they'd have earned another star, but alas, such is the restaurant world.  My personal experience wasn't horrible so I would try it again...but maybe one of their other locations....and definitely not bowls overflowing with liquid!"}
{"text":"Tried the bibimbap for the first time. I'd have to say for the price this place is rather bland. Service was okay."}
{"text":"Decent Korean joint/bar just across from Honest Eds on the border of Koreatown. Much hipper atmosphere than the usual Korean place, with lots of TVs and tops 40s music blasting. We came because we wanted to watch the Jays game and were worried more traditional joints would be playing k-pop music 

Food: Pork Bone Soup and Beef bulgogi bimbap. Both were good and came with the usual assortment of side dishes (kimchi, glass noodles , picked cucumber, miso soup), which were refillable. The bimbap was good but the pork Bone was a bit bland but still had some heat. 

This is a decent place if you are looking for a pint and want some decent Korean as well."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner around 4pm on a Saturday and was surprised the place wasn't packed at the time, the service was good, waiters were nice and friendly. I ordered 2 dishes: kimchi fried rice with bulgogi and spicy rice cake with bulgogi. The food was good though i will say that they were a bit stingy with the bulgogi; on the dish with the rice cake there was probably 4 strands of beef and i mean strands not strips of chunks and the kimchi fried rice barely had any meat to it. Overall the food was good and service was good but i was really disappointed that the quantity of meat was very nill. The price was a bit high for what we got."}
{"text":"I've come here quite a few times, alone or with family usually. I usually get a spicy pork stew which is always so good or the bul go gi hot plates. I love the food here and I love going to this place to eat. I've never had a bad experience here despite the previous reviews. I found the servers were always super nice to me. The place is very clean, every time I went, the bathrooms were clean also. The decor and all that is very nice and modern to. Especially the bathrooms, they looked great inside. It was a nice bathroom experience , not one of the \"oh I think I'll wait till I'm home to use the bathroom\" kind of joint . Great place. I'll be back here."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice. The first time, the food was fine and so I decided to return with friends. 

Between the three of us, we ordered 3-4 dishes to share. Unfortunately, all the dishes were unreasonably salty. We told the waiter and he said that the kitchen had mixed up salt and sugar and all the meat was cooked in the salty sauce. He made no effort to bring new food or to apologize. 

There are so many great little places to eat on Bloor St. I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday last night and was pretty unimpressed. I've had their pork bone soup before and I loved it. On this occasion, I ordered some beef with squid. Holy crap! There was so much gloopy sauce on it and I had to drink liters and liters of water to flush the MSG and sugary, gooey sauce out of my system. I think a layer of skin on my tongue melted off from the chemicals in that dish. 

Potato Pancake was good and the kimchee was nice. Jap Chae noodles were my fave, but everyone ate them on me and when I asked for more, they brought everything BUT the Noodles.

Service was pretty bad. We had to ask them to take all the dirty bowls off the table.

I might come back for the Pork Bone Soup, but I'm not a fan.

Update: Its 3 in the am and all day I've had digestive issues from that meal last night. I was only able to stomach a little bit of chicken soup for dinner this evening. The noises that my stomach has been making all day are truly frightening. Make it stop."}
{"text":"I don't recommend to come here for lunch.
well, that is, if you lunch time has only 30 minutes.

they don't serve you as much banchan if you comes in alone.
and the banchan doesn't come before the meal, it came with the meal.
so you are waiting and waiting for 10 - 15 minutes and nothing except a cup of boiling tea.

when everything came altogether, you get your soup and 3 banchan. Then the Kimchi wasn't spicy, it's really bland.
the Tofu Soup with pork was just bland again, not spicy at all. and to try to finish this boiling soup in like 5 minutes, it's impossible.

as I keep on burning my mouth, I just want to stop and leave as I really should get back to work.
but sadly, the server was hiding in the kitchen. so the entire place was empty, and had to wait for another 5 minutes before I can pay for my bill.

may be should try it at night time or a more \"regular\" lunch hours.

{"text":"Me and my boy went to this place on a friday night for some korean dishes and it was fantastic! I had the tofu and beef with vegetable soup and this is what taste buds are made for! The food is always fresh and hot and ready to indulge. We are always a fan of this place as the staff are very friendly, fast and efficient. Literally, I would raise my hand for no more than 2 sec and someone would come by. This restaurant is a great place to go hang out any day of the week. The ambiance is relaxing and chilling and we watched most of the blue jay game without being rushed to leave even on a busy night. Not to forget to mention but they always have lots of TV and they always play the sport channels we love. Definitely a great environment to unwind and relax on any given day."}
{"text":"The food is fabulous.  This little restaurant took me to Busan, South Korea all over again.  A place where you can have a good meal and a good price to match.  Traditional Korean cuisine that takes you home to oma's table.  Kim chi jjigae, fried dumplings, pork bone soup, and bulgogi with all the side dishes (japchae, seaweed salad, Kim Chi, and bean sprouts).  Definitely good eating!!!"}
{"text":"Shittiest service ever. 

I ordered online. Estimated time delivery was 30 minutes from when I ordered. Took them an hour and a half for delivery. So here was my experience: 

I called them to ask for updates. They said they never got my order. They hung up. Called me again and said they do have my order and had sent a delivery person out 20 mins after I ordered. I asked them for the delivery person's phone number and they didn't know. I called them 3 times for updates when they said they would update ME.

The delivery person came and blamed the restaurant for being busy. He as rude and dropped my food infront of my door. 

Such indirect conflict from both the restaurant and delivery person. Both are not resourceful and very frustrating to deal with. 

It shouldn't take an hour from kachi to deliver my food when I live literally a block away from Dundas. 

Food came cold. Never ordering there again."}
{"text":"Do you like kimchi? Brad likes kimchi too. Brad can eat kimchi all day long. 

Brad ordered a delightful kimchi soup here with pork sausage, make friends jealous who ordered something else. Sorry guys I'm not sharing my kimchi soup you should've listened to me when we ordered. Dumbasses. 

Kimchi soup & pork sausage is the greatest combination since Reese combined chocolate & peanut butter. See you again Ka Chi!"}
{"text":"3.5

One of my go to Korean restaurants in Chinatown. Owl in dragon city is another safe bet.

Food is the same as every other Ka Chi restaurant, average. Servers although only Korean are nice and do their best.

Can never go wrong with the pork bone here."}
{"text":"Kimchi Fried Rice in a Hot Stone Pot? 
Could it get any better? 
Very tasty. Very reasonable prices ($8.50++) and i'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Call me sheep #53.

Of course I ordered the pork bone soup (baaaaaa). It's what everyone is raving about  and I was looking for a cheap lunch (read: too many Monday night $10 pitchers at The Fox) that would put some life back into me.

One order of fried beef dumplings to start, an order of spicy PBS to follow along with all the usual sides and I was in a little bit of Korean heaven.

The dumplings were just greasy enough to let me body know that it was on its way to recovery and the hearty and delicious soup with its spicy kick had me soaring into recovery. 

The soup had three big sections of bone that would make any dog drool and the fall-off-the-bone pork had me drooling. And the broth? Outstanding.

Looking forward to heading back for another run at the menu."}
{"text":"I never ate at their old locations so I'm not familiar/biased with how they used to operate. As a new customer, I went in without expectations and I was impressed; the atmosphere is relaxed and modern and unlike other reviewers, I didn't mind all the TVs they have on the walls. The portions weren't big but sufficient to fill me up and the prices were right for the area (if you're looking for cheap food don't eat at West Village), good place."}
{"text":"I was having another pork bone soup craving last night, so I came here with a friend.

Service was fine, and they had beer, so yay!

The pork bone soup was adequate. It was spicy enough and the broth was pretty flavourful, and the potato wasn't too huge. The pork on the other hand, was kind of hard to get off the bone (that's what she said) and kind of tasteless. It tasted like most of the flavour had boiled away. 

My friend had a rice cake dish which he enjoyed. 

The place was full when i got there at 7, most people had hot plate dishes. Perhaps I'll try that next time."}
{"text":"I love Korean food. Whenever I have it I get a bit nostalgic. 

I had their kimchi gigae (soup) with pork and tofu soup here. It was tasty and nicely spiced and I love soft tofu. Some of the best parts of a Korean meal are the side dishes. The side dish that I really enjoyed was the seaweed salad.

Our server was friendly and efficient, and was quick to refill our side dishes when we asked for more.  

If you are looking for an inexpensive meal, and are craving Korean food stop by here."}
{"text":"Go there with friends for our bi-weekly Korean craving and have been there dozens of times. I am all about the Pork Bone soup ($7), while most of my friends go for the Bibimbap or other soups. Had the BB a few times and it is alright although a few of it's elements are sometimes are a bit dry.

Honestly I really like this place, it`s good, it`s cheap and I have good memories of the place which I will make not to bias my review. 

Is it the best? No. (Ha, no bias at all!)  However I would consider it a great \"Korean Starter,\" to get your friends who are not into on Korean to try out. The soup/broth is constantly good and dependable, and God knows I have had much, much worse. The side dishes are an alright mix, I am a fan whenever they have seaweed, which is often unlike other places. 

The locale itself if a bit of a dive but that is part of the charm with it's high school-like interconnected tables and chairs which remind me of a grade 9th science class. Service is alright, most of the servers never know how to speak English, but then again in most Chinese restaurants, they hardly ever do. One of the best compliments is that I see the odd Korean here and there, which means that at least they are getting some of the stuff right.

However, I am first and foremost about the food and I say Ka Chi is a pretty decent quality place for the price, close to the TTC and I can honestly say that I will go back, but there are better --but by not too much."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not sure how or why this place made it to Blogspot's \"Top 9 Best Pork Bone Soup\" in Toronto... I may not have tried real gamjatang (pork bone soup) from Korea but I'm a gamjatang addict and frequent Korean restaurants with my Korean friends in search of the best tasting soup in Toronto - as well as the one with the most similar taste. My usual spots are Mom's and Lim Ga Ne. My friend and I decided to try Ka Chi out since 1. it's almost always packed, 2. seems trendy, and 3. was on the Top 9 list. 

The restaurant is fairly big compared to the neighbouring Korean restaurants but they crammed SO many tables in. I was basically bumping elbows with the guy at the next table. It was very uncomfortable. I ordered the gamjatang. As usual, we were given appetizers - which were decent. Our gamjatang arrived shortly after. The broth and pork were okay... I've had better. I didn't like the bean sprout pairing... I do think that traditional gamjatang comes with napa cabbage - so I prefer that over the bean sprouts. To sum it up, the food wasn't as it was hyped up to be.

Now the reasons why I give this place 1 star: Not only was the service poor for us - but it wasn't a pleasant experience for everyone else. It was very apparent at how annoyed the other customers were. Sure, food came out quickly but the waiters and bussers were running around like headless chickens. We over heard the table next to us (they were so close to us, we heard their own conversation even though they spoke softly) had errors on their bill, took forever for the error to be corrected. Neighbouring customers were trying to signal waiters and/or bussers but they were so busy (and probably stressed out) that they didn't even notice. Having worked in the restaurant industry for years, I felt bad, so my friend and I informed them. Their system isn't the best. They cram so many tables in and try to turn over tables very quickly to serve as many customers as possible - this isn't good for the waiters and in turn results in poor service. Of course, only management is to blame. 

Would I come back here? No."}
{"text":"This is Korean food? The pork bone soup was too salty, the meat didn't fall off the bone, also the bulgogi rice cake was sub par I am comparing this to Minerva owl on Finch. I would search someone else for Korean food."}
{"text":"I used to like Ka Chi. I really did. 

In fact, the locale in the Annex used to be the Korean restaurant of choice I used take noobies to expose them to the greatness that is Korean cuisine. 

However, the Korean town location has started to slide a bit over the last couple of years. The quality is simply not as good and since I have had better since I really do not go to that location anymore. 

For example, more than once I have found the Pork Bone Soup to be undercooked -- by that I mean the meat is still firmly attached to the bone and thus you find yourself having to wrestle with your meal and you know you can't splash pork bone soup. Since once even a spot falls on your clothes, that stuff is simply not coming off. That is just a pork bone soup no-no. 

However, on a recent trip to Chinatown... I was going to Seor Ak San for Korean however once there, we found the place closed. Bummer. 

I knew of *THIS* Ka Chi from before and after opting to go in here instead of the Korean restaurant literally next door to this one, I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. 

Yes, the place is lacking some sort of central heating and it feels a bit damp, but the food was good and satisfying. The banchan were varied and delicious and even though the motherly waitress\owner seemed to be serving and cleaning tables at warp speed, she was never busy enough to ask if we wanted a banchan refill or if we needed anything, like more tea in a more than friendly manner.

My date and I ended up chatting it up for a bit and not once did we feel rushed, nor did they try to sneak in the tab. 

Finally, we left as the place started getting packed and we felt it unfair to have them loose business because we were using up a table. 

Yup, we felt that good about our stay that we wanted to help them out. That says something. 

If I want to go back to Ka Chi, I will come back to this one locale."}
{"text":"Korean food! Well, I tried the Pi Bim Bap which was phenominal. I'm not quite sure about the other food, but if you're in to PBB, then I would recommend this as a good choice."}
{"text":"First time dining here and it was a pleasant one.  Hubby and I ordered the seafood and veggies pancake, steamed shrimp dumplings, bibimbap bulgogi and California rolls.  Very delicious spread, quickly prepared, tasty and filling portion size.  The bibimbap bulgogi came with a series of small side dishes and it was a nice added touch.  Restaurant looks to be family-run, great service, friendly and attentive.  We literally decided to dine here at the spur of the moment and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. The pork bone soup is, as per usual, two meals for me. The extra spicy is actually quite spicy. It's not as flavourful as others I've had, but it's still quite good.

They were a little stingy on the side dishes, but that's probably to curb waste. They were happy to refill them when asked. 

Service is pretty quick and their dumplings are good the place is clean."}
{"text":"The food was good but not memorable.  Had the Kalbi beef and it was really ok.  Tough on some parts and too fatty on others.  The starters were nothing to sing about and the service was slow.  I will save my money for a nicer place next time."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times - a good spot to grab some quick Korean food if you're not picky. People suggest service is bad, but I've never had problems. They get busy around dinner time and usually only have two servers working, but they're still rushing around and try their best to get to everyone. The bibimbap portion size is good and I like that they offer the option of getting it in a stone or regular bowl - include that with the sides and nonstop tea, then this place does okay."}
{"text":"Arrived around lunchtime on a Monday and there was still an abundance of seats! I got the kimchi fried rice with beef which was the chef's special. The food came out pretty quickly (around 7-10 minutes) and I'm a fan of the food. Although I've had better kimchi fried rice, the portion and amount of meat was worth the price. 

They also served us tea with loose leaf (which I haven't had at other korean restaurants before yet) so that's a plus if you're a tea fan! The prices of korean food here are also pretty cheap compared to other ones."}
{"text":"My new go-to for Korean food! Closer than driving to Korea town and better quality than the Korean/Japanese place by my work. 

There were some reviews that said \"not authentic\" which I don't agree with, but I guess I would have to try every single food item on the menu to truly agree or disagree, but I can tell you that the neng myun was totally authentic and delicious, gave me memories of summers when I was a kid! The galbi was delicious and not fatty. Even the banchan was good, meeyuk is one of my personal favourites which they had and I enjoyed greatly. 

My mom got the dolsot bibimbap which she thought was delicious and ate the whole thing. 

Don't expect ambiance from this place, it's pretty basic with no frills and no attempt to be fancy or anything. But I found the both the food and staff great!"}
{"text":"One of the best korean restaurants for dukbukki! Soft and chewy rice cakes bathing in rich and delicious spicy sauce. The portions to prices ratio is excellent. I had bibimbap in a bowl and it was more than filling. The servers here are nice as well."}
{"text":"Dinner Jan 19, 2011
Inexpensive, close quarters, go in to eat and get out right away!!!  I am not partial to the pork bone soup or stew or whatever it is.... way too spicy and I don't feel like playing with my food.  I love the bulgoki on the hot plate with a side of rice or the chicken with the rice cake... and of course - all the side dishes that come with it.  Drink the water and tea ... the meal is under $20 for two people.  You really can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Spicy Chicken Bulgogi was so, so good - service was a bit slow but was friendly... Hubby was disappointed in his Bulgogi (on a hot plate - dry and a bit overdone) but my son liked his, the regular bulgogi ... Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have variety in Bloor West.  It's okay but I wouldn't say it's great or even good Korean food.  The huge positive here is the friendly service.

We ordered the seafood pancake and the veggie tofu stew.  The pancake was ok but it was not authentic Korean in that it was an eggy pancake as opposed to the lovely dense chewy pancake served in Korean town.  Likewise the tofu stew was disappointing as the broth was not super flavourful and the tofu was scorched at the bottom which might explain the smoky odd flavour.  I think the best part was the banchan and of course the service.

It was busy and steady so that's a positive sign.  Ok if you're desperate for Asian and don't feel like making the trek to Christie or Yonge and Sheppard."}
{"text":"I've been to Ka Chi twice, and twice my husband and I had the pork bone soup! It's flavourful and the soup base is excellent! Best pork bone soup in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The service wasn't great and the horrible Van Gogh knock offs were difficult to stand, but I'm still a solid 5 stars.

I was told there was a good Thai restaurant in the area, however I couldn't find it and wandered into this place instead - without even consulting Yelp!  The place was full of Koreans so I figured I was on to something.

I ordered the Bi Bim Bap, Dolsot with Chicken.  The food looked amazing, but I couldn't see an egg.  WHERE IS MY  MOTHER*!%&$$ EGG?  I looked under the chicken and down to the rice.  WTF? Oh well, I figured they must know what they're doing, being Korean and all.

Amazingly, best Bi Bim Bap I've ever had, Toronto or otherwise.  In addition, the Kim Chi was fresh and tasty.

Strange to find this wonderful place in Chinatown."}
{"text":"The food here is alright but I prefer Korean food in real Koreatown (Bloor/Christie/Bathurst vicinity) or the Yonge and Finch area. I prefer pork bone soups from other places, but I do like how generous they are in their portion and how they fill the pork bone soup with bean sprouts. It's a bit watered down to my liking (I generally prefer my pork bone soups to be more brothy and thick, like a stew), but they make it more like a true soup. Just a preference thing. The meat is super tender and falls off the bone, though! So deboning is an easy feat. My favourite things to order here would probably be the meat dishes with rice. Overall: Service is polite and fast; and the place is clean and spacious. Good for groups. :)"}
{"text":"Gloomy summer day called for a trip to Ka Chi. We decided to go during lunch in the middle of the week to celebrate a friend's birthday. I've heard many reviews that their pork bone soup was really good so I thought I would try it this time. When we arrived the place was half full and there were about 3 korean girls serving. We were promptly seated and automatically our waters came. We ordered pork bone soups and the korean seafood pancake. After placing our order, within 5 minutes our sidedishes came. We had 5 different side dishes consisting of kimchi, glass noodles (my favourite!), honey coated potatoes, eggplant and the bean sprout dish. All the side dishes were fair in size to share and having the option of unlimited refills really made us enjoy it so much more haha. We definitely went for 4 or 5 rounds of refills.

The stew came shortly after. Came boiling with mountain high amount of pork bone. It was delicious. There was a generous portion of porkbone in each stew, along with some napa, potatoes and bean sprouts. I ordered the extra spicy and it came with some hot green pepppers inside. One portion is definitely more than enough for 2 meals. It was not too salty and the spicyness really gives it a kick (especially when you take your first bite). Of course the stew came with a bowl of rice. The korean seafood pancake was quite enjoyable as well. Came with plenty of squid and was fried to a really good crispiness! Didn't get soggy throughout the meal.. though at the end of the meal you do see the puddle of oil on the plate haha.

Definitely will return and try their soon tofu next time because that also looks really good!"}
{"text":"Ka Chi just breaks in to the 4 star category for me. I've only had the hot stone bulgogi and spicy chicken bibimbap here and it's wonderful and very filling. However it looses 1.5 stars due to poor service which I admit is not something I found very surprising, but I could not justify a 5 star review without everything running well. 

I must admit I've not had a lot of experience with Korean dining and I've never ventured in to Koreatown for food, so keep in mind that while I enjoyed Ka Chi, I might not know what constitutes good bibimbap/korean food. 

The last time I was here, I also tried the the Korean Pancake, which was pizza like, and had some squid/cuttlefish pieces in it, while it was tasty it was a little weird for me to see a tentacle filled arm breaching the surface of my pancake. The pancake came in a minute before the bibimbap so I didn't really get to enjoy it properly. Highly suggest at least 2 hungry people to share one pancake appetizer which is large and not cheap. 
The bibimbap came with a good assortment of side dishes that always satisfied, even the broccoli was OK. 

We ordered soju to mix with beer (which wikipedia tells me is called somaek), and while it added something extra, more experimenting would be needed on my part to get a balance I would enjoy more. 

The bill did come up for $55 for the 2 of us as the 2 beers and soju did add up. 

I would definitely recomend Ka Chi if you're in the area and are not looking for chinese. Looking forward to broadening my picks next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Would give negative stars if I could. The service as others have said is AWFUL. They had no tuna and shrimp in the seafood and tuna dishes. A friend has a plastic piece in her food. They told us the pictures are not what you get and on the missing tuna, they told us to look harder! Will never come back."}
{"text":"Have been going here for the past 7 years. They recently moved to Bloor West village from the annex. Same owner, same amazing food. Hands down the best Korean in the city. 

Make sure to say hello to the owner Francesco. He usually works on the weekends and you can find him tending the bar."}

{"text":"Food was good. Price was decent. However the boss needs a lesson in professionalism. He lost his temper during dinner service and smashed something on the floor behind the bar which sent shards of glass into the dining room. He's lucky it didn't hit anyone. Completely unprofessional and unnecessary, especially when he's in full view of patrons."}
{"text":"I've been to many Korean restaurants of similar style and menus and this one just falls as average. Especially comparing to Seor Ak San Korean Restaurant, Seor Ak San is a much better version of this restaurant. 

Tried the pork bone soup which looks like it's a big portion, but it was more bone than actual meat and it didn't fall off the bone very easily. The meat just wasn't as tender or flavourful. The broth also could use more depth of flavour. I ordered spicey, which it was but most of the other flavours were hard to taste. 

Side dishes were average, although the kimchi was actually a little bit bland. 

Service was pretty good, fast and the staff were friendly and inviting. 

Atmosphere is very casual, quiet to average noise level and nothing special about the decor. 

Prices are definitely reasonable for what they offer; I wouldn't expect it to be any more or less expensive. 

Good for after a long day of work and if you don't want to spend a lot of money."}
{"text":"I came in mid Wednesday afternoon for a quick lunch. My cousin and I were the only customers there. And we both had the pork bone soup. The food came within 15 mins which was good, but I found the soup to be too watery. They gave one potato and 4 pork bones whereas my cousin had about 6 pork bones! They also load it up with a lot of bean sprouts. 

One thing I didn't like so much is the customer service. There were 3 servers that day and they were chatting amongst themselves. I waved my hand for the bill but no one noticed me, so I waited about 2 minutes before I waved again. But of course , no one saw me and I was right there. So I stood up and walked right up to the front to pay. I know there might not be anything to do but they should check up on their customers once in awhile. 

I won't return unless I'm legit desperate for Korean food but don't wanna trek to ktown. Also, all their dishes are easily way over $10 which is insane."}
{"text":"I never like pork born soup until ate at Ka-Chi. This place not only make good pork bone soup they make AWESOME pork bone soup. 

Been here almost every Thursday night after work for the past 4 months. 10 out 10 times I order Regular Spice pork bone soup. Oh man, what can I say. Taste so good even my ass agrees to it the following day.. :-)"}
{"text":"Oh man, Kinda disappointed today. The PBS I got was all bones. Still tasted good :-) I hope next time I go back they will give me more meat. My friend was a little luckier and got a bowl of meat. 

I like this location. Neat little shop right next to the parking lot save so much time looking around for street parking."}
{"text":"Came with a bunch of friends. Clean, decent-sized restaurant. Maybe slightly understaffed. Got the gamjatang (pork bone soup) for 2 ppl.  While it was really big with a whole bunch of other goodies in the pot, the flavor of the gamjatang was just ok. Nothing mind blowing. Server had to change out the gas cannisters for us twice because we got half-empty ones each time. Kimchi seafood pancake had lots of toppings in it which was cool, but ultimately was a little too oily/greasy for my liking."}
{"text":"Of course I had to get the Pork Bone Soup.  It was huge compared to other restaurants.  The taste of it was average but they put a lime on top which adds a citrus zing to it,  which was nice. 

Service was nice as always in most Korean restaurants.  A good refresher from the yelling aunties of Chinese restaurants down the street."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Korean restaurants in downtown Toronto. Where can you get a balanced, fresh, delicious meal for under $10? 
The place is always clean, bright and spacious. I've tried almost everything on their menu and I love them all. They just updated their menu w/ more noodle and rice dishes. Tried the new addition; Jjajangmyun- was a disappointment. They used udon noodle and it's a bit too sweet for my taste. 
They make the side dishes pretty much everyday and they are fresh and different every time you go there (unless you eat there twice a day :P ). 
My favourites are: Seafood pancake, pork bone soup, dolsop bibimbap, or regular bibimbap, spicy pork with kimchi and galbi."}
{"text":"I was hoping to like this place but it was meh.  A staple of a Korean place ought to be the Pork bone soup and this place boldly states the most famous Pork bone soup in Toronto... it lacked the characteristic flavour of perilla seeds and bean paste...the Pork bones only tasted of ginger.  The seafood pancake was ok... crispy on the outside with a little bit of octopus... should have added some fake crab as filler. Also had the hot plate spicy bulgogi which was sweet with the characteristic korean chilli... this was quite good."}
{"text":"The food:
Yum! The potato pancake was delicious as was the tofu and beef stew. The side dishes that accompanied the meal were also very good. My girlfriends and I also order beer and the total came up to about $17 each so it was very good value for what we got.

The place:
What an upgrade from it's previous location just a bit down the street. I was there a few years ago and although the food was good back then, the restaurant was small and a bit of a hole in the wall. It's much more spacious now, with a patio (too bad it was raining outside and we couldn't make use of it), and with the new decor, it just looks much more upscale than it was before. An important detail? The bathroom was also clean and spacious. A big plus!

The service:
I thought it was very good. The food came quite quickly and even though my girlfriends and I stayed for a long while after we finished our meal, we didn't get kicked out.

Would I go there again? Yes! Again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Love this spot!

1) Amazing patio for the summer! It's huge and there has always been space when I have come, even though it is busy.

2) Excellent selection for meat eaters and vegetarians alike.

3) Reasonable prices and consistent food. I have been here 5 times or so and am impressed with their reliability.

Love the seafood pancake, tofu stew and squid bibimbap.

The only reason I didn't give it a five: Although the servers are very nice, they can be a bit slow and forgetful. Forgivable though because they are always friendly..."}
{"text":"Service was really good, food came out really quickly, was assisted by the boss (?) with wifi right after I sat down. The side dishes were ok overall, but I love the bean sprouts and tofu were my fav. Ordered seafood tofu stew and couldn't stop saying how good it was while eating  two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place had a great ambience, it was a wonderful place to eat with the family, or out on a date. Especially with especially with small children. However, the food was just OK. Nothing great, nothing bad just OK."}
{"text":"We ordered seafood pancake and the traditional Korean spicy sausage stew. Seafood pancake is delicious. But remember to ask for a mild or less spicy sausage stew. The server didn't ask us how spicy we want. And our stew came out super spicy."}
{"text":"Good food, however one thing I hate is places that close like 1hr+ early. I usually stay an hr at least afterwork, so its annoying to see people clocking in early. I think if you're a restaurant, and you advertise being open till 11:30 then you should take orders until 11:30 or 11:15 at least. Don't just say \"ok no order, sorry closed\" when its like 10-10:30, every take-out place does this and it just rubs customers the wrong way. Especially since they're probably still putting out orders for orderit or justeat or something. Anyawy, if you're going to close at 10, just advertise that and save everyone the trouble."}
{"text":"Not the best..service is horrible and the food is average..i had tried almost every korean restaurants in downtown toronto until i found jang su chon (on andrew street, just beside kachi)and they are probably the best out of all."}
{"text":"Our favourite Korean restaurant in the neighbourhood!  Everything consistently tastes amazing! I've been a long time customer of this restaurant - back since it was in the annex location. The new restaurant is beautiful, open, and clean. Also may not be a bad spot to watch a game - they definitely don't have a shortage of TVs! Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I've noticed that the prices have increased slightly and the portions (both dine-in and take-out) have decreased! I would still recommend this resto."}
{"text":"The waiters here need a kick in the ass or something.   A bunch of young guys talking about K-Pop behind the counter while my friend and I were surrounded by dirty tables, and having to wave them down whenever we needed something, and having to ask twice for extra cups and water.

The food was ok tasting, but the portions are much smaller than other Korean places I've been too, and they also charge you 3$ to refill your appetizers!!  

Also, I had bad diarrhea 2 hours after eating there.  Judging by the dirty tables, I assume the back kitchen is not too clean."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a weekend and my pork bone soup arrived like it had been warmed in the microwave with hardly any soybean sprouts and no potato in the broth. Asked repeatedly for sides dishes refill and the one server working the floor was not equal to the task. Easily the worst-run franchisee of the three in the Bloor-Dundas-Kensington triangle. If you like Ka Chi the brand, go to the other two. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"It's a nicer and roomier dining lounge than its two sister locations, but the quality of food is virtually identical. Admittedly, I have a weakness for the pork bone soup, and the one that Ka Chi serves is probably my favourite in town. The cold sides that accompany the meal here is also very good and varies depending on the day - there was sliced eggplant among the sides when I last visited. Service is gracious, but it does suffer when the place gets busy and there isn't enough staff working on the floor. One extra note: the hot tea that they bring you here is the best kind I've had in any Asian restaurant...I always forget to ask what type it is."}
{"text":"More expensive than the 5 other korean restaurants within 250 meters of this place. I feel as though, you're really not getting much for the extra few bucks. Considering that they all have virtually the same menu and the food is basically the same at all of the korean places in the area- the only way we can judge it is on the quality of the side dishes."}
{"text":"This is my go to Korean in Toronto. Pork rib soup is a MUST try. You will feel like a caveman eating it. This is not a first date place, the tables are nailed to the floor- may have previously been some sort of pizza joint."}
{"text":"I ordered the hot stone pot bibimbap and the bowl wasn't hot enough to make the rice crispy and the rice was all soggy. I also found a hair in my food so I lost my appetite. The side dishes were flavourless and the waiter didn't refill my tea. I would recommend going to bathurst and Christie area for authentic Korean food instead."}
{"text":"A hit or miss w service I think.

Came today for a nice Saturday lunch.
Service was awesome."}
{"text":"relatively pricey consider its location. otherwise pretty good deal, the staffs are very friendly, you can get refilled of the complimentary, although the overall storage of it ran out fast. 
food is tasty and the portion is good !"}
{"text":"Only one review!  This is blasphemy!

So people go here for the PBS (aka Pork Bone Soup or kam ja tang).  Them shits is delicious!  Spicy broth and massive chunks of pork bone -- I think they're spines or something.  Anyway, there's a lot of super tender meat hanging off these bones, and with some care and patience, you can scrap a massive bowl full of pork product into your soup.  PBS is sort of like the 'chicken soup' for the Korean 'seoul'.  Pun intended.

For about $7, you stuff yourself silly or you can take it home and have another meal later on.  This place sees more action from me in the cold winter months, as the soup is perfect for those cold snowy days.

This is one of my favorite spots, and I must add to my list immediately!"}
{"text":"I really like this location for Ka Chi. The seating is comfortable and the servers are very friendly. The food is good. I really like that they off the mild pork bone soup because I can't really eat too spicy and I find most korean places their pork bone soup is so spicy that I can't eat it."}
{"text":"Korea town has several restaurants like Ka Chi; simple, affordable, home cooked style meals.  The place is fairly busy.

You get a few small bowls of appetizers, to begin your meal... and when you get the cheque, you'll be blown away that you didn't spend a fortune on something that tasted authentic to the region.

This isn't a 5star restaurant in terms of culinary excellence or artistry.  It gets a 5 star because its an affordable meal for when only Pork Bone soup can sooth your soul.

Edit:  The place has moved across the street to a bigger space, prices have also gone up too."}
{"text":"First time here. It's a pretty casual restaurant, nothing fancy at all. Staff were as friendly as can be as there was an obvious language barrier. So just be prepared to repeat yourself a few times lol. The service was average but the food was pretty amazing! We got the California roll, spicy California roll, avocado roll and cucumber roll sushi, as well as a beef and vegetables stew with white rice which was just as delicious as the sushi. 

I would definitely come back here again as I really enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"Favorite korean restaurant!!! Many varieties, average price, good service, good food! Deserve 6 stars!"}
{"text":"I'm so shocked that my experience at Ka Chi was so awful. I've been here twice and the first time I remember quite enjoying their kimchi chigae but this second time I came back I had their tofu stew and it was so salty I couldn't take more than three spoonfuls. I don't know if the lid of the box of salt was loose and they just dumped the entire box in or what, because I could feel the salt crystals dissolving on my tongue - it was so awful. I really should've asked for another one looking back at the situation, because it was just inedible. I think I consumed half a bowl of rice with those three spoonfuls of stew. Luckily there were a few side dishes to soak up the sodium, but they were also mediocre at best. I'm really hoping that this was just a one time mistake and it was a new chef or something.. Because they shouldn't be allowed to serve such salty food- I felt like my mouth was going through a drought for the rest of the evening. I definitely don't think I will be returning anytime soon..

The extra star was because their service was good. The food was an absolute dud."}
{"text":"The waitress gave me the wrong food. And I didn't  feels like they are sorry. I had to change the food in the hot summer noon. The food also tastes not good. Even the side are just so so. I won't go back again. If you wanna have good Korean food, go to OWL on Bloor street."}
{"text":"I'd say one of the WORST restaurants in Toronto.  Ka Chi is the reason why Korean restaurants never take off.  The food was meh, and ambience blah, and the service is just TERRIBLE.  AVOID this  place!

Food: 2/5, we got various stews between the four of us and they were just \"spicy\" without flavour.  The side dishes were puny and bland testing which worked out since the stews were just salt.

Service: 0/5, this is where they failed.  They made a mistake on one order.  The girl with long black hair then decides to semi-yell at the short haired girl asking are you sure you did this right.  And it's so obvious we can hear them.  Then she returns asking oh, I'm sure you ordered this.  WHAT!??!! Then, we kindly ask that they just give us the right food. So it was already bitter to begin here that they decide to make us feel uncomfortable and forces us to ask for the RIGHT dish.  To end it all, we asked for the bill, and then kept waiting for credit card machine or just a return visit to pay but it didn't happen so we walked up to the counter in the front.  As we were walking towards it, the SAME LONG HAIRED GIRL says \"you have to pay!!!\" Were they seriously thinking we were dining-dashing at that slow pace?  We responded saying, we are paying up front.  

Ambience: Who cares!?

Price: 0/5, Really? over $15 per that dish? Not worth it for what you can get elsewhere in the area like Tofu Village or any of the boon-shik places.  

We only went here because it was on new years and barely anything was open.  We should've gone across to Arisu instead.

DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU WANT GOOD KOREAN FOOD."}
{"text":"many ka-chi locations in toronto. always good pork bone soup. crave some meat in spicy soup, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Fast service, smaller sized (but fairly priced) food. Would return here for quick after work meal. Quiet atmosphere. Friendly waitstaff"}
{"text":"Lovely place in downtown's koreatown. Honestly, I'm a bigger fan of koreantown in willowdale because I think that area is more authentic and this area is more catered to the caucasian taste of korean food. Kimchi's spiciness level was weaksauce, but it wasn't bad. I believe I was the only asian in there other than the staff.. first time witnessing that in a korean restaurant! The banchan were pretty standard and pretty much devoured within seconds.

I like how they have vegetarian options. It's a gem to find! Of course I order the dolsot bibambap without the egg. It's such a staple anywhere. I found it to be super filling and I didn't even finish it - definitely worth it for the price. My friend had the naengmyun for the first time (oh, shoutout to the dude that let us have it because it wasn't summer yet and wasn't supposed to be available until it was hotter out). Anyway, my friend definitely liked it a lot and said it was very unique. The flavour in their food is quite pure and doesn't have any of that nasty shit used to modify flavouring and give you a disease at the same time. I also found service to be quite fast and friendly. 

Generally not a nice place in koreatown and I wouldn't hesitate to stop by if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend as I was craving some Korean food. Decided to come here after hearing good things about this restaurant from a colleague. It was pretty quiet here for lunch with very few patrons dining in here. It was at 1PM and you think being located in Chinatown, it would be busy here for lunch but that wasn't the case.

They have a good selection of your traditional Korean dishes so it's not hard to choose dishes here. 
I always love the Korean appetizers that you get at the start of the meal- simply delicious and good as usual. We ask the recommendation of the waitress on which pancake to order and she suggested getting the seafood pancake- simply delicious with a side of spicy sauce to dip in. For the entrée, I ordered Kimchi and Beef Stir Fried Rice in a Hot Stone Pot. I thoroughly enjoyed the fried rice and a hot stone pot. The spice level was just perfect for me and definitely tolerable. It was a good amount of rice, meat and vegetables- a very nice fine balance. Service here was good and we got our food very quickly so they did a good job on that- I was pleasantly surprised. Pretty good place to eat lunch. I highly recommend you order the seafood pancake and for sure definitely get the rice in the hot stone pot. These are some dishes that you definitely won't regret getting. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience. I would definitely come here and try some of their Korean dishes! Everything on their menu looks delicious."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times.  The place is clean, the food is good, and the prices are pretty darn amazing.  The first time there were four of us and we ordered a pitcher of Steamwhistle (good beer by the pitcher, always an excellent sign) and a half dozen dishes, including: the potato pancake and vegetable pancake, a couple of noodle dishes, an iron plate dish with seafood, and some rice dishes.  The bill was $80 with tip (yes, you read that correctly).  I've been back twice and it's been good both times.  I don't know much about Korean food but I know what tastes good and this place is really good.  Not all the staff are fluent in English but that simply adds to the fun."}
{"text":"Delicious food for a good price and good to split with friends if you are sharing. The service was nice as well."}
{"text":"High hopes for this cute looking place - however the indifferent millennials staff and mediocre food trying to be authentic lead to a disappointed experience at a high cost! 
The Bimbap bulgogi was flavourless with very little meat and undercooked rice was a great touch! 
The glass noodles or jap chae has a burnt smokey flavour like something got left on the grill too long ! 
The bulgogi hot plate was small for a meal and the tiny side rice dish was shocking for the price. Overall if you want a good Korean meal head further east!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!

My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on Saturday after an exhausting shopping trip to Honest Ed's, and we L-O-V-E-D it. It was the perfect way to relax after maneuvering the maze of Ed's. We're still talking about how amazing the food was!

I ordered the hot tofu stew with vegetables, and my boyfriend got the chicken bul go gi dish, both of which came with rice. We loved all the sides it came with (kimchi, glass noodles, seaweed, coleslaw). We also ordered the fried veg dumplings as an appy. The dipping sauce was deeeevine!

The quantity of food you get is way more than what you pay for (yay! Who isn't a fan of good value?). The food comes out quickly, and the servers are attentive and prompt to provide whatever you need.

The restaurant is clean, and big enough so that each table has enough space to have a conversation without the people next to you hearing (this isn't always a guaranteed feature in Toronto eateries). 

I found a fish head in my vegetable soup (I'm vegan, so this freaked me right out), but even that doesn't stop me from giving this place two thumbs up!

I will definitely be back the next time I find myself in Korea Town!"}
{"text":"I had the spicy beef stew here and it was quite good. We had some chicken and beef pan-fried gyoza to share which was good too! Unfortunately, there were alot of fruit flies around and we had to spend most of the time defending our food. - Main reason for the 2 stars!
I had been to the other locations before and this one was not good in terms of the appetizers offered- The selection was pathetic and they didn't taste good.
The decor was here was a lot nicer than others I had been too.
Not sure what the other yelper meant by his comment or if they had updated it - but they had traditional koren metal chopsticks when we went.
The service was great and the food came fast (good when your starving)!"}
{"text":"All you need to get at this place is the pork soup.  It was sooo good I drool when I think of it!  Definately a good deal.  The 3 of us ordered 3 entrees and an app and it was only $30.  Next time I go back to Toronto I'm going to order 2 of those soups just for me!"}
{"text":"Awesome as the devil is red. Best Korean food I've had. Best kimchi pancake I've ever had. Bulgogi was the bomb."}
{"text":"I've only ever had take out - no idea what service / atmosphere is like. Food is great though, slightly on the pricey side but worth it I think. They always write cute messages on the takeout containers! I recommend the galbi (bbq ribs), and make sure you order at least one thing that comes with \"sides\" so you get to try their spicy kimchi!"}
{"text":"Bought pork bone soup not along ago unfortunately I found a black hair in it ... Not to impressed..."}
{"text":"My colleague ordered take out from this restaurant and the kim chi side dish they gave her is one piece of soggy cabbage."}
{"text":"Sort of industrial divey looking place, but it had a big crowd and no one else in Koreatown would serve us food at 10:30 on a Saturday night.*

I would agree that this place isn't fantastic, but it's good for the price. The restaurants which rejected us because their cooks had already gone home would probably have cost us 3X as much.**

We ordered some really good pan fried beef dumplings and some squid with veggies, a couple of beers and of course, the kim chi. This was by no means the best food I've had in the neighborhood, but it was good and it came REALLY FAST! 

In conclusion, I may not go out of my way to visit Ka Chi, but I would visit again.


*If a restaurant's hours are listed until 11pm, then damn straight they should be taking food orders until 11pm. #fail.***

**I mean you, Korean Village!

***I am not even in twitter and I feel a need to put a hash tag in front of fail!"}
{"text":"Food here is alright but it's not as good as the Bloor or Finch location. They are a chain restaurant but I guess management is different and so are the cooks. Been here a few times and just went yesterday with friends. Noticed their side dishes are different from Bloor location. I'm picky with my kimchi and I found this one to be hard with little seasoning, not fermented well. 

The service here is also really slow...in getting your order, refills of water or even giving you the bill. A lot of the time, I felt like just going up to the counter and asking if that would speed things up. I don't know if they just need more staff or they are just slow... But go here only if you have a lot of time. Lol."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if Ka Chi is as consistent with the other locations as reviewed by other Yelpers. 

I was craving for some Gam Ja Tang (Pork Bone Soup) last night and came across Ka Chi when I was Chinatown. The decor was nice. Classic paintings on the walls, chandeliers for the lighting, soccer match playing on 2 flat screen TVs.  

My gf and I ordered the Gam Ja Tang and Spicy Beef Bulgolgi on hot plate:

Gam Ja Tang: The only complaint I have is that there were too many bean sprouts. It took away most of the flavor from the broth. The broth itself was quite flavorful though, though I have to admit the pork bone itself was quite bland. There was no flavor. 

Beef Bulgolgi: My own personal fave. This place does it well.  

Overall, I would probably stick with Nak Won or Owl of Minerva for my Korean food cravings."}
{"text":"We were super excited to get a Kachi in the neighbourhood. The joint on opening night started kind of weak - long wait times and mangly portions of banchan side dishes. But they really improved and now we go at least once a week for our stew and kimchi fix. Service is fast and portions very good. I still wish they gave more banchan but the flavours of everything else are very much on point, in line with other Kachis downtown. Cannot go wrong with kamjatang porkbone stew and kimchi pancakes. Reliably good Korean food."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday night and was seated immediately. The service was great and the food was great. I love that this place has a decent amount of options for people on the Slow Carb diet (SCD) - I got the stew which comes with rice on the side. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. There's nothing too special about the food here other than the side dishes. These guys had the best side dishes I've ever had at a Korean restaurant. I love the potato and cucumber side dish the most! I ordered the beef soon dubu jigae which was pretty good but again, nothing too special. 

I like the service here as well. The servers are fast and don't say too much to you (ie. Constantly asking you how's your food, if you want more water etc). They are quick to respond to your requests. 

The prices here are actually a little more expensive (probably because of location) than what you can find on finch but its close to the subway if your in Chinatown and want quick Korean food."}
{"text":"The place is good. I recommend it if you just want to sit and have a meal. The food portions are good, and tasty. I ordered the pork bone stew (extra spicy) which was loaded with pork. Be warned, if you go extra spicy avoid the hot peppers litter through your meal. 

The pricing is also good. I would definitely go back for my Korean food fix when I'm in Chinatown."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Korean restos I've been to in Toronto. I'm here at least once a week and my staple is the pork bone stew, which I've probably had about 25 times in the past few months. Neither overly salty or spicy, it's consistently satisfying and the portion is always massive. 

The staff is friendly enough, although distracted/overwhelmed at all times. The move is to order everything up front, including drinks, as you're not likely to get a mid-meal check-up. I usually just go to  the front to get more water or pay the bill. 

If you catch the owner when he's in, talk to him - he's great."}
{"text":"I usually have the pork bibimbap here, which is pretty delicious. The staff is polite too. Not bad."}
{"text":"I usually go to the location on Bloor. But I find this location is a bit more spacious and not as congested. This location also has additional menu options like combos (mulneung myun with kalbi for $16.99) and they serve sushi/sashimi.  The service is quick and friendly. They ban chan is far better than the one at the Bloor location when it comes to taste and variety.  Plus if you don't feel like something from their Korean menu, just go next door to Jang Su Chon for additional Korean meals.  You can't lose!"}
{"text":"Been shuttered for amonth or so now. Re-opening at Bloor / Markham SW corner - we're looking forward to the bigger patio - will this be the place to forever break the evil spell of doom that has held cast over this corner for years?  So many places have come and gone , may be haunted."}
{"text":"We were told we could sit anywhere but they kept \"politely insisting\" that we sit right by the window.... We didn't receive any banchan(side dishes), and had to wait a while to get the bill because no waiter came to check up on us at all or glance our way. Although the food was tasty, this place will not be my first choice when I come to this area."}
{"text":"Just another catchy name.  Food is average, cost is low, service is terrible.  It is better than many of the other Korean joints in the area but you can find better without much effort."}
{"text":"This restaurant must be reviewed highly by non Koreans. Food was NOT good. I had the kimchi jjigae and it was sweet (shouldn't be). Side dishes were average, service was below average. We had a few drinks and ordered other dishes- consistently was not good. I will never go back- there are better, more authentic options in Christie."}
{"text":"Quality ingredients always show. This was probably not the case for Ka Chi. The staple pork bone soup was lackluster at best. Flavours are bland and lacking in complexity. The bibimbap was okay but the stone bowl wasn't hot enough so the rice didn't caramelized. Also, I find that they are skimpy with the meats and greens in the dish. As for a few other dishes like the spicy chicken....etc... they too suffer from the same fate; low in flavour.

Kudos is given for the unexpected great service and low low prices.

Overall with so many other great eats in this part of town I am not quite sure why you would want to eat here. Unless if you are on a strict budget and have an insatiable appetite for Korean food right now."}
{"text":"To this day I am still perplexed by this chain of Korean restaurants. My first underwhelming experience was at their basement location in Chinatown so going in I wasn't exactly too thrilled. However on this night the choice wasn't mine and on this night the weather was just too damn good to stay indoors. It's certainly a bittersweet moment to realize that these guys have the most inviting patio on the strip yet probably the worst Korean food nearby as well.

Where do I start? Is it that somehow tasteless fall-off-the-bone pork bone soup? Or that one dimensional (just spicy) broth? Maybe it's the mediocre frozen/fresh dumplings in that regrettable broth. No, it's not any of the above. Surprisingly it's the humble grain that feeds billions around the world; the lowly rice. The way the rice was cooked sent chills down my spine. It was so atrociously bastardize that even that women(I read about) who had just recovered from a 16 year hunger strike (god bless her) would politely decline this offering. Even the mice and cockroaches will probably go on a hunger strike of their own at the site of this. Our Asian ancestors are probably be rolling in their graves right about now. Mushy, wet, sticky, yellow and somehow burnt at the same time."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to restaurants in Toronto for an affordable and reliably tasty menu. The servers are all very kind and the patio is a particularly lovely place to sit and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"I've been to this Ka Chi location several times since I work nearby the area.  The food has always been consistent for me whenever I come here to eat -- usually I get the gamja tang, jajangmyeon, or the cold noodles.  Can't comment on the take-out quality, but for the dine-in dishes, I've always enjoyed what I've eaten here.  Good portions of side dishes and the mains are always decently sized.  Service might be lacking here, but you get what you pay for - their menu items are very affordable!."}
{"text":"Really a 3 1/2 rating. Pork bone soup is usually good but the last time it wasn't tender enough and had to fight to get the meat off. Hand started cramping as a result. The appetizer plates (pan chan) are okay and gives a good variety. There bibim bap was acceptable but didn't have the usual mushrooms even though they showed them in the menu picture so my wife was a little disappointed but the large amount of bulgogie they put in almost made up for it. The staff are generally friendly but can be difficult to get their attention. Nice having many tv's to show the game while eating. I like how they provide a jug of water but I'd like the option of hot tea. Also like how they have the paper napkins at the table instead of only providing one per person like other cheap restaurants. Also their napkins are the best quality I've seen. Little things like that matter especially when you have spicy soup and need to wipe your brow a few times. :) Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Tatsty food, good price, nice environment. Last time i have been in Kachi is 2years ago, the new one is bigger with pretty decoration but little bit odd for Korean food restaurant but the food still taste the same, definitely have to come back here. They have a bar section too which is really cool!"}
{"text":"They have a huge list of Korean food that is absolutely delicious. It's right next to another good restaurant Arisu but I would recommend coming here instead. It's good on price (only slightly more pricey). Also it's probably an environment Canadians are used to, more regular restaurant vibe. Staff is great also. The only complaint that I could give is maybe that we asked for spicy but I believe he thought me and my friend couldn't take it XD it only happens once and it's more funny then anything but just in case I always specify that I like and can handle the spice because Korean food has a red pepper spice that isn't that common in other food. Always recommend,  it's just such a good environment."}
{"text":"Unlimited side dishes. Comes with kimchi, potatoes, seaweed, been sprouts, glass noodles. And you can get as many as you want. Eat up!

Pork bone soup is always delicious. The extra spicy isn't really spicy as a whole, but there are a few slices of some killer peppers that you want to avoid accidentally eating (you'll die). A bowl of the pork bone soup with unlimited sides and a bowl of rice for under $10. Slow simmered, tender, savoury, meaty. Baller.

Kimchi seafood pancake is a must! Savoury goodness. It's like a hash brown but with octopus and onions and other delicious flavours. Get it!

Service is quick and friendly :)"}

I dunno what's taken me so long to write a review for Ka Chi... hey it's summer im aloud to be lazy!

Tentative to try one of the many Korean restaurants (especially with my caucasian gma tagging along) we decided that busy=good. And it looks like we made the right choice as even my grandma was commenting on how delicious and hearty the food was.

We cramped into the packed, food court reminiscent joint and were handed a paper menu to check off. The prices were super reasonable with most dishes ~$7-8. The pork bone soup was soothing and had an impressive amount of fall off the bone meat. Seafood pancake was delicious as usual, and all the other dishes were great as well.

I enjoyed Sunrise House slightly more for its service, space, and refilled banchans. So I've got to be picky about which one of the many Korean restos I give that coveted 4.0 to. :P"}
{"text":"The best Korean food is on Bloor down near Christie Pits, but this place isn't bad at all. 

Went with some buddies who wanted to get Korean food on a whim and I was fairly impressed. The place is clean, servers friendly, and the menu not complicated or pricey. The food was tasty but not the most flavorful Korean food I've ever had. Friends got spicier seafood type dishes, most of which I did not try, but the one with the rice noodle that is shaped like a tube was pretty good. 

Overall decent, but I've heard from a few other people that The Owl of Minerva is much better, and it's only two blocks away. 

Prices and service were good, no complaints there. Still worth the trip, but maybe the extra distance to Owl would be more worth it."}
{"text":"Sushi/sashimi is horrid, do not ever order it there. Stale old non-sushi grade fish. 
Rolls were bad too, they were falling apart and tasted bad.
 I make better rolls at home. 

Korean dishes are good though, its a solid lunch choice."}
{"text":"Upon arrival you would think I've stumbled into the mute version of O'Noir (the restaurant where all the servers are blind).  The waiter silently plunks down menus and an order ticket on the table.  He silently collects them later.  He silently responds to requests with so little as a grunt of acknowledgement.  At least the waiter can't be surly he doesn't talk.

The FOOD:  I've mostly had the bi bim bop here.  It's an acceptable, if a bit skimpy rendition.  Not a lot of meat or veggies.  Nice hot bowl though.  Not a ton of flavour  

The banchan were adequate.  The kim chi was a bit watery, but I quite liked the spicy pickles.  

Atmosphere?  Eh, what atmosphere?  

Overall, it's an acceptable place at an acceptable price.  Little to recommend it, but then little reason to avoid it if you want Korean in Kensington."}
{"text":"Ka Chi is three-and-a-half stars. 

The food is good overall. It is served hot, has good flavour, yet occasionally suffers from over-use of oil.

The decor is odd. They have about 20 non-working TVs all over the walls above some random art work. However, this does not factor into my review.

Service is somewhat off, more in a lack of understanding of good service than anything else."}
{"text":"I'm lukewarm on Kai Chi. I didn't love it or hate it! I just found it a very different experience than I'm used to. After revising the menu a few times I went with the beef option and while the portions were quite large I was rather disappointed with the taste of my meal (Bulgogi and mixed vegetable). I'm not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"A comfortable open space, tastefully decorated with almost a dozen different light fixtures. More roomy and franchized-looking than the Korean restaurants I'm use to. Still comfortable but just more polished.

I was looking for something with soup but not anything spicy,  so I settled on the beef dumplings and rice cakes in soup. It came in a large bowl with plenty of steaming broth.  The soup was great, not too salty but the generous amount of black pepper gave it a good bite. The dumplings was mostly filled with minced beef. Not amazing but they were something to chew on in between sips of soup. Hit the spot for me and what I was craving. The side dishes were good, plenty of variation between the 6 dishes to keep things interesting."}
{"text":"For Korean food downtown (and not in Koreatown) -- it's pretty good.  I ordered myself a soon doobu with kimchi, pork and dumplings.  Can't complain - it was hot, piping, and full of tofu.  However, the rice wasn't the usual rice that comes with the soon doobu.

Banchans were good -- we had 5 different dishes; and they gave us double of each because we had 5 people.  

Service was mediocre.  We actually had two tables going on (we had 11 of us; and we had to be split up).  My other friends had their food delivered faster, answered faster, and got their bill faster.  Granted, we were sitting in the front of the restaurant (so at the opposite side of their kitchen/cashier counter).  However, still -- it wasn't appreciated.

Also, they didn't turn on their A/C - and we were all burning whilst watching hot and spicy tofu stew."}
{"text":"Not as good as before it moved to this new location. The food are on the salty side. Also the price has gone up a lot."}
{"text":"Ka Chi was a funny experience, really. Firstly, the servers didn't speak or understand a whole of of English; they just nodded and pointed at things. Come on, people! We live in Toronto!!! 

I asked to be seated elsewhere (than the place originally assigned to us) as I like my cozy corner spots in any restaurant. But the server had to ask 3 others for a translation... and at the end of it, I thought to myself that I was probably being difficult and sat down at our original spot. Also, I wanted forks... and um, I don't think they understood that either since I never got any. Surprisingly, they understood \"bill\" - that's my attempt at a PJ. 

My friend and I both ordered soupy dishes and I wanted to clarify that I was given the correct item. Instead of a simple yes or no, they server ran to grab a menu and frantically point out the item to me on the menu. A little ridiculous. 

The restaurant, look-wise and location-wise, is actually really nice and contemporary. They portions are MASSIVE. Just don't order anything with rice-cake in it; you'll end up with more rice-cake than noodles and beef. 

I am probably not going back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here and wow the food and service were amazing! Best Korean meals we've had in a long time. Korean food is healthy and full of flavours. Nice clean and modern restaurant too in Bloor West Village. We'll definitely come again."}
{"text":"I love Korean food, especially Korean spicy rice cakes. Such a fan that I make it a mission to try them at every Korean restaurant I end up at. 

A quick lunch break in Korea town (March 20, 2016) lead me to Ka Chi. I have a friend who's roommate works there and she raves about the food (biased? I'd soon be able to determine). So, based on recommendation, I opted for Ka Chi as a lunch spot. 

I order the spicy rice cakes with fish cakes. They were so good that I used Foodora to order it to work the following week. I love that Korean restaurants provide little apps prior to your meal. I ordered a side order of white rice for my rice cakes. They come super saucy so mixing in the rice is delicious, and a personal preference. 

My friends ordered a stew and a fried rice, which they enjoyed. The waitresses were attentive and sweet, helping my friends out with the menu to the best of their abilities (there was a bit of a language barrier). 

5/5 stars for great food, clean space, and helpful waitresses."}
{"text":"This was the least authentic Korean food I've ever had from a Korean restaurant.

We ordered two dishes that should come in an earthenware bowl still boiling when it gets to the table. Not only were they not boiling, the food at the surface of the bowl was barely hot and there were clearly raw vegetables in it.

I ordered my dish to be \"extra spicy\". If you are going to offer 3 different levels of spice, the highest level should have some considerable level of spice. If the only difference is adding a couple slices of habenaro peppers to the top, that's not extra spicy.  Furthermore habenaro peppers make it less authentic.

Lastly, my food came at least 7 minutes faster than my companion's food. This is not professional. It makes me decide either to be impolite and start eating, or wait and let my food get even colder that it came.

Overrall, not impressed."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this Korean restaurant in the BWV.  Had the seafood pancake, BBQ ribs and pork bone stew. Food was ok. It is also quite expensive compared to other Korean places. Service was very slow - was told they were short staffed"}
{"text":"Pretty much your only choice if you want to eat Korean on a patio.

This location has churned through a few recent incarnations, so here's hoping Ka Chi fares better.

I will admit that I typically wouldn't seek out Ka Chi amongst the other Koreatown options, but I'm glad we tried it out (if only to take advantage of the nice weather). My DC and I shared the pork and kimchi on a hotplate, and were surprised at how delicious it was. We devoured it. Nang myeon and chicken noodle soup were also very well received.

Humourously, the owner chewed out a couple of patrons for smoking on the patio. And he wasn't brief about it either. I support this."}
{"text":"Tldr: Good food, good price, poor service

Came here on Saturday afternoon with two other friends around 12. The place was half full. I was craving bibimbap so I ordered that ($10.95, reasonably priced)! And my friends ordered Pork Bone Soup and Spicy Tofu (Soon Doo Boo) Soup. The other two dishes were also between ($9.95 and $11.95). The portions were great and the food tasted pretty good, very reasonable for the price. However, their service was slow (we raised our hands multiple times but they did not come over right away?), and we had to ask for more water two times (the second time we had to go up the counter because they forgot). Not to mention that they only accept credit/debit over $15 purchase. Overall, satisfied with the food quality and taste but not satisfied with their service so I'm not sure if I'll return again."}
{"text":"OVERRATED AND DISHONEST FOOD.  Even for a place known for cheap eats, there should be some standards.  

Wow, I'm shocked by all the rave reviews for the pork bone soup here.  We had the pork bone soup (my non-korean husband's staple when we go to a new korean place) and their so called \"korean\" potato pancake.  

First of all, the pork bone soup is a sad excuse for authenticity.  What's up with the lime wedge that comes on top of the soup????  There is nothing \"korean\" about lime.  Secondly, the meat was tasteless as if it had been boiled in unseasoned broth.  As far as I'm concerned, pork bone soup should be cooked for literally hours in well seasoned broth more or less flavoured with Korean miso, perilla leaves, ground wild sesame powder...etc to name a few key flavours.  The meat bore none of those flavours and the broth! oh the broth....was let's say, missing the flavour that can only come from hours spent on stove top.   I would never pay to eat such a crappy pork bone soup ever again let alone call it one of the best in the city.  

Then there was the potato pancake.  What they served us was a pancake that resembled rosti, dripping with oil on parchment paper.  Are they serious?  Do they even know what a Korean potato pancake is supposed to look like???   This really pissed me off.  At least know the food you're supposed to be serving.  Korean potato pancakes are made from hand grated potatoes mixed with more potato starch giving it that signature chewy texture.  As far as I'm concerned, if you're not willing to do the work to serve up a dish, then don't bother having it on the menu.  

Their MSG laden banchan were equally disappointing.  Overall, the food served here can only be summed up as products of necessity.  The food was cooked by someone who needs to run a restaurant to make a living, not by someone who has any pride in what they serve their customers.  I would never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nothing stood out for me. I enjoyed a good meal of my favourite, seafood tofu soup... but it was missing the clams I enjoy. We were also given a variety of appetizers, but they were in minuscule amounts!! My favourite sugar coated tofu appetizer was disappointingly below average.

Still got a decent meal for a decent price."}
{"text":"Been coming to this franchise when they started on bloor St. Amazing Gamjatang aka pork bone soup! Felt like some Korean comfort food on a chilly night! Highly recommend ordering the Gamjatang! The Soon Tofu with kimchi & pork was good as well but not the best. However it is still satisfying!"}
{"text":"Amazing. The beef bulgogi was delicious. Honestly everything looked amazing and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Got delivery through Door Dash:

- fried dumplings
- steaming dumplings
- jap chae with vegetables
- stirfried noodles with vegetables (udon)
- tofu bibimbap (no egg)

All pretty delicious as was the potato banchan. I only wish the portions were larger, more banchan and if only their kimchi was vegan, but totally ordering again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Kimchi Ramen.  The noodles looked and tasted like instant noodles from the dollar store.  The sausage (+$3) option looked and tasted like a larger version of Vienna canned sausage.  Whomever is running this place and kitchen has no idea what they are doing.   I asked them to take it back and the server sent someone to translate. The second person (presumably a manager) listened to me and says \"ok ok\" and walked away as if I was asking for more water or something.  Finally I took the $14 dish to the counter and left it there saying \"this is dollar store ingredients, I'm not eating it.\"  The staff acted as if this was rote and happens often.  In all fairness, they did not charge my bill for that dish.  Overall, you could not pay me enough money in the world to ever set foot back in there. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Seriously what is happening to Kachi? Couple of years ago I would go and eat there a lot. I would order their pork bone soup almost every time. Today I went there I ordered it again. My order came, the meat literally SMELLED BAD!! It's got this stinky smell. I asked for another one, the second one came, it didn't smell bad, but it was UNDERCOOKED and the meat was TASTELESS. I literally felt disgusted, and asked to order something else. I then ordered their lunch special spicy bbq chicken. The waitress came out again and told me, \"because lunch specials don't come with side dishes, but we served them to you with the pork bone soup already, we are gonna take it out, and we are gonna change the four sushis to fried dumplings. And rice was already served, so no more rice for you.\" Btw the dumplings were very soggy and tasteless. I was like okayyyy, just gonna eat and get the hell outta here....NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that the name of this place means \"underpants\" in my fathertongue, I decided to check this place out - I saw a sign for the lunch specials and couldn't resist.

For a sweet $6.95, I got the beef bulgogi lunch special, which includes (in addition to the beef bulgogi) salad, miso soup, four California Rolls, noodles, rice and herbal tea. It was all delicious, except for the salad which was made up of soggy lettuce.

I got curious about the noodles because they had a unique texture, so I asked the friendly waiter if they were made from wheat, rice or something else. He was utterly perplexed by the word \"wheat.\" He came back a couple minutes later to tell me that they were made from potatoes. I'm not sure if that's accurate, but they were damn good, so I didn't really care. I just wouldn't recommend this place to anyone with dietary restrictions or allergies.

Otherwise, the TV was tuned into some weird Korean reality show, and Duran Duran and other cheesy 80's music served as background music to a lovely meal. I dug it!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently delicious!! I go about 1-2 a week! 

Great place for vegans as well, the tofu bibimbop is amazing! Best korean food in Korea Town!"}
{"text":"My sister is visiting from Midwest US and was craving Korean food. Where to go when the choice is endless in Toronto? A few summers ago, I was obsessed with Korean food and frequented one of Ka Chi's other locations often and enjoyed it back then. 

This location is quite big with two dining rooms. On Saturday afternoon, it was crowded with most tables occupied. Service was quick and attentive. My sister and I ordered the Pork Bone Soup, Korean Seafood Pancake and Kalbi. Everything was quite tasty, especially the soup. It comes to your table in a large bowl that is piping hot. The soup was perfect for the cold weather today. 

Along Bloor, there are heaps of Korean restaurants with similar offerings; however, I find Ka Chi to be quite clean and reasonably priced. 

Good for: Korean, Pork Bone Soup"}
{"text":"Everything here is pretty inconsistent. Service is terrible when it's crowded. The food is pretty good though, refills on sides cost extra."}
{"text":"We needed dinner and to catch the Jays game and Ka Chi delivered. The food and service was good but the ladies' washroom was terrifying. We tried the kimchi stew and tofu stew, both were good and hearty. The free apps were good, the pickled cucumbers and japchae were the better ones."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Food was really good. Had the bibimbap and pork stew. Lots of flavour. Food also came out really quick. Great atmosphere. Very clean. Fair prices. Overall a great experience. I would definetly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Craving for pork bone soup one of those cold days. It's generic typical broth which makes it a bit boring. But generous portion of bones and the servers are very patient. Overall I just expect the signature pork bone soup to be more stand out but it turned out nothing very special. I put in all side pickles dishes I found those add layers of flavor to the broth and makes it more interesting."}
{"text":"A shadow of its former self. Pork bone soup was disappointing. You can tell because there are few Koreans eating here now."}
{"text":"I don't understand the three-star rating on this place at all. 

Ka Chi on Dundas St. served the best pork I've possibly ever had at any restaurant, ever, of any cuisine, in any city in the world. I got the pork-bone stew. It translates to about $8 American dollars including tip, and it comes with the typical sides: kimchi, seaweed, and cold fragrant noodles. 

The pork stew was a dream. I almost have no memory of eating it. One minute it was there; the next minute all that was left were several dripping bones. The meat was fork-tender (I mean, chopstick-tender), luscious, slow-simmered; the stew broth was fresh and complex, and spicy but not insane. I tasted fresh ginger, crisp bean sprouts. This food is joyful and feisty.

Everyone who worked at the place was friendly and attentive. The ambience in this location is great: huge oilpants along the walls and a sleek, warm, hip feel. It was very comfortable and welcoming."}
{"text":"Really bad place our meals (dumplings and soon tofu soup and coke)only costed 20 dollars the cashier try to charge us 35 dollars meaning 15 dollar increase of my regular price of 20 dollars pls avoid this place at cost ."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is cheap and good, service is perfect-staffs are very friendly and the restaurant looks very clean!"}
{"text":"I give this 3.5 stars.  Having read the reviews, I had low expectations, but the food is actually good.  We had the fried dumplings (perfectly done, crispy but not oily, light), bibimbap with tofu and bulgogi bibimbap.  My husband said the bulgogi is as good as ours, which is pretty good, in my opinion. 

Service to get our food was great and very fast.  But when we finished eating, they forgot about us.  We had to flag down a server to get our bill, they didn't clear our dirty dishes, and then we had to flag down a server to pay.

Prices are also higher than in Koreatown.  After tax and tip (no alcoholic drinks), we paid close to $50 for two people.  But rent in Bloor West Village is probably a lot higher than Koreatown.  For the convenience of not having to go to Koreatown for Korean food, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really good spicy seafood noodle sounds and black bean noodles! I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Korean fare.  

Fairly new interior, nicer than most places in Little Korea, prompt service, and good portions considering price.

I ordered a Pork Bone Soup (spicy, ~$8-9) and it came with a bunch of sides.  Broth itself wasn't very rich, but there was flavour.  Banchans were just alright, never asked for refill 'cause there was enough.

TIP:  You hafta go downstairs, so probably not the best location if you have kids in a stroller."}
{"text":"Omg, amazing!!! I ordered the hot stone bibimbap- the spicy shrimp one- for $ 9.95. It was surprisingly good, and I really enjoyed it. There were about 6 side dishes that it came with, and the the bibimbap was sizzling when it was served. I added chili sauce & soy sauce, but it was delicious even without the garnish. The side dishes were also yummy, but there was so much food that I was unable to finish them. Everything was fresh. I was also pleasantly surprised by the great service- all servers were super friendly, and jovial. A great environment and great food for an unbeatable price. One thing that I didn't appreciate was the adjoining table where the party had little kids who were overly loud and disruptive- but the restaurant is hardly to blame for that."}
{"text":"When we arrived there was only one other table in the restaurant. Perhaps the lack of customers caused the waiters to be over attentive. This is usually not a bad thing in a restaurant, however, we were approached multiple times within a 3 minute span about our orders from all different waiters. We advised them we were not ready but it made us feel really rushed.  

My friend ordered a pork bone soup and I asked for a spicy chicken bulgogi. I asked if I could have a fried egg on top. (A request that is easily fulfilled at other Korean restaurants), he answered that he didn't know if he could do it. I asked if he could ask and he walked away with a roll of his eyes. He came back and replied that they could. 

When my food arrived, it did not have the fried egg but I was so annoyed that I did not ask for it. The food was okay, I've had better in Ktown. My spicy chicken bulgogi was not spicy at all and the portion was small for the price. At the end of the meal I noticed on the receipt that they had written mild on my order which I did not ask for. They should've asked before assuming whether I wanted it spicy or not. My friend didn't mind her pork bone soup but would've enjoyed more than one potato. 

I'll stick with Korean town at Christie or Finch. The food is cheaper and tastier. For a restaurant that is trying to be more upscale, I would think the service would be better."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap Korean food! One of my go-tos for Korean food in Chinatown. Ordered cold noodles + kalbi ribs combo and it came SUPER FAST within 5 minutes. 

Seating is not too comfortable and I found the side dishes not as tasty. The potatoes were rather dry and lacked that sweet flavor."}
{"text":"I got to say, since I've been to Ka Chi many times (at different locations), my 1st time at this location was pretty disappointing.  

I'll 1st point out the positives and say that the atmosphere's nice, it's pretty clean and the service is not bad (they're pretty quick).  However, I do feel like a key fundamental for any Korean restaurant is the perfect Pork Bone Soup (GamJaTang) and I feel there there were so many fundamentals of a Pork Bone Soup that they are seriously lacking.

I ordered the spicy version of it and portion-wise, it's fine and it's stacked up pretty nicely.  The problem I had were the following.

- The vegetables (kimchi and bean sprouts) were plopped on top of my pork bone soup and I just feel that they should be in the broth, simmering and stewing in it to get that flavour.  Also, is it normal to be served a lime wedge with my pork bone soup? It's the 1st time it's happened to me.

- The pork bones themselves were just overly inconsistent.  Out of the 4 bones I had, only half of them had the proper, fall off the bone texture that I just expect out of a GamJaTang.  The other two were tough to chew on and I thought overall they were kind of tasteless (felt all they did with the bones was boiled them in just water).

- The pork bone broth itself is just lacking.  It doesn't really have a whole lot of complexity and flavour to it, to me it just tastes like spicy salted pork broth.  There's normally like Perilla seeds and other seasonings that gives it that distinctive taste.  

Side dishes were pretty good, although I must comment that the seaweed, while texture was very good, was grossly underseasoned.  

All in all, this is not the Kachi that I once loved."}
{"text":"Best Korean food ever! Been here many times so far and never been disappointed by the service or food! Definitely try out kalbi dish, it's the best!"}
{"text":"Korean food at its best! This is my all time Korean restaurant that I go to for the past 8 years even before they relocated to a newer and bigger place. The pork bone soup is just amazing, pork is tender and the spice level is just the way I like it."}
{"text":"I had my first bibimbap experience here and though I enjoyed it, it was nothing too great. Surprisingly, certain bibimbap bowls came with an egg but the one I ordered (chicken) did not. Some items seemed a little overpriced but still within a modest dinner budget. Service was kind of slow but it was a busy night so it is understandable. Not sure if Ka Chi is worth a repeat visit when there are so many better meal options in the vicinity."}
{"text":"The cook forgot my spicy chicken on the hot stone pot bibimbap with spicy chicken. Nice serving of vegetables which included corn and the usual Korean vegetables. The sides were interesting: kimchi, potatoes and potato noodles- had quite an unusual texture and flavour. The Korean pancake with kimchi on the other hand, was a little burnt. Mostly made of cabbage it was pleading to the taste buds."}
{"text":"Horrible service, not so good food, shitesy about side dishes, douche bag owner that drinks alcohol while \"working.\" I am serious, go find out in the late evening. Waiters/waitresses always seem to be walking on tight ropes due to owner."}
{"text":"1000 times better than the original Kkachi.
Better service, but still a little shitesy about side dishes.
Much cleaner than the original Kkachi."}
{"text":"This review goes without saying that Korean food in general are very salty. This restaurant reflects this very well. Everything on the menu will be salty, especially if you haven't tried Korean food before.

Poor service, but to be fair, I decided to eat at around 930 at night. If you are dining in, your food will be served within 10 minutes.

Seafood soon-tofu soup: true to taste, but with an obvious hint of MSG. Serving size is great, stuffed with tofu and served with previously-frozen seafood. The only annoying thing about this dish was that there were pieces of clam shells everywhere. One thing you do NOT want to do when eating is cut yourself with a sharp piece of clam shell. Anyhow, overall, the dish was great.

This place is great if you are hungry but willing to spend little. But, be aware that you will likely have hypertension for a few hours from all the sodium you will be consuming."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Feels like a korean joint owned by a chinese person. Something is just not right when it comes to the flavours."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my partner. It was really busy but we fortunately did not have to wait to be seated. The portion sizes here for the meals are quite big and the prices are very reasonable. The service however we received was subpar due to how busy it was. It is also quite loud so it may not be the best place for an intimate date. We both got hotpots and they were quite good. I would come back but at a less busy time."}
{"text":"Interesting concept to mix a sports bar with Korean cuisine, but that's the best part of this place.

Food is sub-par and service is just ok.
I had a hard time breaking meat of the bones from Pork bone soup... Never happens even in the cheapest Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Located across from Honest Eds on Bloor Street, this new Ka Chi location was very easy to find. Had to wait 2 hours for Snakes and Lattes... we might as well go eat first :)

First impression of Ka Chi was WOW, this Korean restaurant had a serious upgrade! Never seen a Korean restaurant this trendy before, EVER! The high ceiling, dark decor and furniture looked very chic and modern :) It definitely brings in a younger crowd with pop and jazzy music blasting in the background.

Both my friend and I ordered the beef bimbimbap served in a hot stone bowl. Watch out because it is REALLY hot. It is even more delicious if you add their Korean hot and sour sauce to it... not too too spicy #yum! You also get the typical complimentary small appetizers too.. with kimchi, spicy cucumber, seaweed, bean sprouts, japchae noodles, etc.

Overall, a very satisfying meal indeed (very stuffed!). Service was great - courteous and quick... responded well to our special requests! Restaurant itself and washroom downstairs were kept clean. So, congratulations, 4/5 stars! I really enjoyed eating here... and it is a good place to catch up with friends :) I will definitely come back to try out more of their menu items!"}
{"text":"If I was to review this location of Ka Chi a couple months ago, I would've given them a 4-star, but I was really disappointed from today's visit.

This used to be my go-to lunch spot for work once every week because it fast, cheap, good portion, and I LOVEE Korean food, and I always get hot stew or bibimbap.

Today was a cold rainy day, so I ordered the soft tofu stew for lunch because I was cold and just wanted some hot boiling stew to warm up, and dam I was DISAPPOINTED...every single stew I've ever had in a Korean place always came BOILING hot and BUBBLING in the stone pot, but for SOME WHATEVER REASON today, it came in LUKEWARM WTF?! The soup wasn't even sizzling! PLUS I asked for no salt in my stew to which the waiter responded OK, and my stew still came with salt, I didn't bother to complain, guess imma just have to experience a thirsty and dry mouth for the rest of the day.  I ALSO asked for a glass of warm water, and they handed me a glass of COLD water...SMH WTH.

I hope this was only a one time mistake and off day :("}
{"text":"I came here a couple time and could never remember what this place was called. I finally did some research so I could inform all of you yelpers about this glorious place. This is my favourite Korean joint. 

4 STARS for the restaurant: It a decent size. I love how they accommodate solo eaters. The place is pretty clean and the people are pretty friendly. 

5 STARS for the food: they provide you with little side dishes to eat with your meals, which are all pretty yummy.....the bibimbap is AMAZING, as well as the spicy pork!!"}
{"text":"The one located on Bloor is definitely one of my favourite Korean restaurants in Toronto! A few of the dishes were a bit oily but the fast service and delicious selection of food is a stellar deal for such a cheap price."}
{"text":"yes, ka-chi is cheap, but not nearly cheap enough to excuse the mediocre food and the atrocious service.  you don't have to look hard or far to find similar food and a thousand times better service. 

if you've time, check out the following comments: http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/671243?tag=main_body;topic-671243"}
{"text":"Ka Chi is even better after it has moved to a better and bigger location. It's now right across from Honest Eds and it sits many more avoiding the huge line ups that they used to get. 

The food remains as good as I can remember it. My favourite here are the pork bone soup and soon tofu. And for those who can't stand the spice, you can even ask for mild or not spicy. Like all other Korean restaurants they also have small appetizers (potato, seaweed, beans and bean sprouts)."}
{"text":"one of the best korean restaurants in the k-town. yummm"}
{"text":"Went here last night with a party of seven, Boxing Day night.
It has nice, casual dining decor and decent seating arrangement. Was fairly not busy, maybe two other groups and the restaurant seats around 45 - 70.

It has fairly standard Korean food - bibimbap, kam ja tang, beef, etc.
I liked the several big screen TVs that aired the junior hockey game last night.
Food came quick, servers were attentive and it was overall a decent experience."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite go-to spot for Korean food but sadly after visiting some other restaurants in the are Id have to say that my love for it has gone down :(.

I used to think that the sides were normal and that they were supposed to be really sweet/sour (and I feel most of their side dishes taste this way), but after eating at some other restaurants that have better-tastings sides and also offer more sides, I don't enjoy the sides at Kachi anymore.

Id still come here for the seafood pancake, I think that they make that pretty well here it's very crispy and delicious. 

Their pork bone soup used to be one of my favorites but again I have found cheaper places where the bones tear apart easier and the meat is much more tender :(. T
he spicy noodle rice cake was also one of my favs but they now make the portion ridiculously huge in a bowl so that the noodles and rice cakes at the bottom get soggy quick. And It's filled with veggies now too. I alwways feel overwhelmed now when I order it and it ends up not tasting so good once I get past the top layer."}
{"text":"I come here regularly, and I always enjoyed the pork none soup and their seafood pancake. I also like to order their spicy noodle with rice cakes (which has a pretty big portion) and their shrimp and vegetable fried rice :).

I think they serve slightly less sides than before, but they give around 4-6 each time. 

The atmosphere is nice! The restaurant has a good design since they renovated a few years ago and it's very modern-looking now. When the weather is warmer they have a very nice patio for customers to be seated and it's also very nice ^_^!

I've never really had a problem with service, I always thought the owner and the servers were really friendly towards me. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food. The bibimbap and buchimgae are superb! Few minutes walk from AGO."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night to eat. Was craving Korean and we happened to be in Korean town. Walked by first and saw the crown inside so went back to check this place out. We ordered beef dumplings, kalbi, and bimbinbop. The dumplings were on the greasy side. The kalbi was tasty but again a bit greasy than what I am use to. The best dish is the bimbinbop. 

I would say the food satisfied the craving where I don't think I would go again."}
{"text":"This is their new spot, their old one was opposite the street. It was here that I had my first taste of Bibimbap Hot stone bowl. 

Service: Waiters/Waitresses were friendly and always checking on your needs. Food came out on time. They were able to accomodate my request of a dish that wasn't even on the menu (Japchae)

Cleanliness: I don't know when they moved but the places looks newly renovated to me, that means the place does look clean. 

Food: Had another Bibimbap Hot stone bowl as well an order of Japchae (to go). Both were delicious.

Price: I feel there is a small increase in price (compared to the last time I was there) and the portions may have been a little smaller (for the bibimbap). 

Overall It was a nice overall experience. Until I find a better bibimbap I probably would keep coming back here."}
{"text":"I had a nightmare here, the pork bone soup is sick, and they even donot clean the table and chair, I sit on a chair with some food on it. I will definitely  not come again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for! 

I ordered the bugolgi bean stew and it literally came with 4 slices of beef, few pieces of zucchini and onions. The broth was good but It wasn't worth the $10 for the lack of ingredients. 

The service was quick and friendly. They will refill the sides when asked."}
{"text":"There are a number of locations but the one I go to the most is the one on bloor. I also go to the Dundas/Spadina location. The Bloor location is a bit more efficient, but I've had good service at both.  Ka Chi is my latest obsession so I can't recommend it enough! :) 

How do I love Ka Chi? Let me count the ways! 
1. Service is consistently good
2. Their rice cakes. I get the rice and fish cakes with bul go - gi (beef) in a sweet sauce often, and I could probably eat this every day.
3. Cheap, cheap, cheap! $8 entrees - hot pot bimbimbap, stews. 
4. Vegetarian options for my vegeratian friends! 
5. Easily accessible location - easy to meet up with your friend!
6. Patio in the summer :)"}
{"text":"I used to go to the bloor location but that place no longer has the best food. This one still serves quality food.  The service is also always great and friendly.  I come here often for lunch and am never disappointed"}
{"text":"I love all three branches of Ka Chi, but I come most often to this location and the one on Bloor. Never disappoints! 
 
The price is slightly higher at this location than their bloor st location but it's not a dealbreaker for me."}
{"text":"Overall a very good experience at Ka Chi in Koreatown. The food was inexpensive with huge portions and side dishes. We had all lived in Korea for 2+ years and have had a lot of Korean food, this food seemed really authentic. 

Went here with a small group, and had bibimbop, mandu and pajong (korean seafood pancake.). The pancake was flavorful and crispy and everyone's favorite!

The bibimbop was excellent, but the dwenjong jiggae (fermented bean soup) was a little bit too sweet!

The service was friendly, although a bit sporadic!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. No frills Korean chain that services honest, clean food. This location in particular is pretty good service, and a little less busy then the one on Bloor. I've eaten everything on the menu at least twice. Pork bone soup is the usual on cold days/nights, and my other half likes the stews. Their bulgogi and Kalbi can be a miss at times, but overall pretty consistent. Seafood pancakes and dumplings are average, but I'm a sucker for them 60% of the time. Best part? Two televisions that are usually showing the game... Cheapest seats in town!"}
{"text":"Their tofu stews are great, and I love their side dishes! Nice environment and friendly service :)"}
{"text":"The kimchi hot pot had a rich, smokey flavour and was filling for 2 people. I also like the various udon dishes. My friend who had a bibimbap for the first time said it was also tasty. Pork bone hot pot was also GREAT. The service was pleasant and swift. A nice ambience and very clean too. I really recommend this restaurant for those who enjoy Korean food."}
{"text":"Spicy bulgogi is tasty but the gam ja tang (pork bone soup) we got was half cold! I wasn't a big fan of the soup itself - had too strong of a bean sprout flavor."}
{"text":"The best korean food you can find. It is the real deal. In fact, I was the only non-asian in the restaurant. I ordered the spicy Bulgogi and they were worried that I could not handle it. I barely could. Was very good. They serve large portions at a low price. 

If you are anywhere near honest eds, you need to try this place."}
{"text":"Great Korean food. Love their bulgogi!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this great Korean restaurant for three years and have always had very good dining experiences here. Its a family run shop, and the food here is always fresh and the service is always very good. Like Pho, Korean is basically the same wherever you go, but portions here are always generous. Try the spicy beef stew, its a great way to warm yourself up on a cold day and there is a generous amount of beef in the stew. They also have a diversified menu and offer table top cooking as well (two can dine for less than $12.00 each) What I really like about this restaurant though is they listen to you. You can have less spice or more spice, or if want more of a certain type of vegetable or meat in your main dish, they are very accommodating. If you are craving Korean and are in Chinatown or the Market, stop by here, and this place is always open."}
{"text":"To me Korean seems to taste the same wherever I go, but I really like this this place. It's clean, the service is great and the food is very fresh tasting. Pricing is excellent and they have a good selection of Asian beers (Hite and Sapporo are my favourites) They have a menu with many items to choose from (have not tried the sushi here yet) If you do come here, get a seafood pancake! Its bursting with flavour and is a great appetizer or side dish. This area has many Korean restaurants, but I always keep coming back here."}
{"text":"I had a chance to visit this location of Ka Chi for a second time last night.  Quite honestly, we were trying to get into another restaurant, but the line up was too long and we had a large party, so we gave in and went next door.

Ka Chi was ready, willing, and able to accommodate our party of twelve.  The servers quickly dragged over another table so we could all sit together.  As many other Yelpers have observed, the restaurant itself is pleasant enough.  It feels spacious and looks tidy.  No complaints there.

Last time like pretty much everyone at the table, I had a bi bim bap dish and wasn't too blown away by it.  It was okay, but I think they were a little tight on the ingredients. This time I tried the beef and veggies on glass noodles.  I actually liked this more though I would have preferred to share it with someone as it was too much of the same flavour for a main.  Also it was a large portion.  I enjoyed the side dishes a lot especially a different noodle one that I've never had before.

The service was fine.  Our server did come over and ask if we wanted a refill on any of the sides which I thought was good.

Will I go back for a third round?  Likely not, but that doesn't mean that Ka Chi isn't decent; I've just haven't had anything there that's stood out as a reason to return."}
{"text":"I was super excited to see that Ka Chi was coming to Bloor West and as soon as it opened, we flocked in for lunch!

Arrived around 11:30am and were seated next to the front window.  They did a good job with renovating the space, although the decor is slightly confusing - many large screen TVs playing sports combined with a bunch of pieces of \"flair\" and \"art\" possibly plucked from the discount bin at HomeSense.

We ordered from the lunch menu - bulgogi ($10) and pork bone soup ($8).  Both orders came with rice and only a tiny serving of kimchi and daikon (where are the other 4-6 banchan dishes???).  The bulgogi meal came with a miso soup.

Once our food arrived, we were disappointed with portion sizes.  I know they were lunch orders but it looked more like appetizer (or tapas) sizes to me!  I think there might have been 8 pieces of beef on my tiny little iron plate.  And the pork bone soup came in a miniature version of the standard regular bowl.  

Service was a bit lacking.  Our server dropped off our food and didn't check back in.  I would have loved another few kimchi refills!

We left hungry and not likely to return.  There are better Korean options just short drive from BWV including Insadong and Chaban."}
{"text":"The place itself was very clean, service was good, staff were courteous, but i found the food to be just OK.  They brought the appetizers with the meal instead of before which I thought was weird, and they didn't refill them.

Ordered the dolsot bibimbap and it was pretty decent, only complaint would be that the bowl wasn't as hot as i'm used it (i got some crispy rice, but i'm used to getting a whole layer of it!). Maybe I'm just spoiled living in the yonge/finch area. 

If i was DT and in the mood for Korean food i'd probably stop by this place again to try the ribs."}
{"text":"Service here is very attentive. This place is a very popular option for delivery, you'll see a constant stream of foodora people come and go. I had a spicy chicken bibimbap and while I did find it good, the portion is a small. I also had the seafood pancake and there were big chunks of seafood everywhere, probably the best pancake in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Average and affordable - the Kachi on Kensington is much better but this place is bigger and can accommodate large groups. Food and service are both hits and misses. There are many days when there are 6+ interesting side dishes, the orders are well seasoned, and service is super polite. But unfortunately there are equally a high number of instances where there are only rehydrated wakame and kimchi as sides, the taste is off, or the kitchen forgets the orders of half the party. The Pork Bone Soup ($10) is usually a safe go-to though! Overall, dishes are generously portioned and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Been meaning to write up on this one for awhile. 

Once or twice a year I go through a month of \"pork bone soup\" craze, where I absolutely have to get my Ka-chi fix once a week or so. Usually this takes place when the weather is cold, rainy and a bit crap.

I go here solely for the pork bone soup. It's damn good. It's very spicy so if you can't handle the spice - make sure to ask them to ease off. I personally lurrrrrrrrrve it 

WARNING - Do NOT wear white or any light coloured clothing item if you are ordering pork bone soup! The spice is deadly, if that broth touches your clothing it's not coming off, you're f*cked! Sometimes the broth sloshes over the bowl when the server sets it down, or you could splash it around a bit trying to get the meat off the bones.

The soup itself is not always consistent, I'll admit. I would say 80% of the time I get a \"good\" one. Sometimes the meat seems under cooked and I have trouble getting it apart, or sometimes the soup has too much/too little meat altogether. Otherwise it's always delicious and tasty, with lots of cabbage/sprouts on top, a big piece of potato and the tastiest broth ever.

I've recently ventured across the road to try out Thumbs Up! which seems to have equally good pork bone soup (see my review).

The bibimbap here looks \"meh\" and it's expensive ($4 more) compared to the Buk Chang Dong down the road which is the best. I don't order anything else off the menu here.

The side dishes are decent, I love their kimchi.

The place gets packed and the servers are not always the friendliest. The owner is sometimes very friendly and sometimes a bit rude; he's hit or miss. The seating can be a bit cramped. Don't show up with a group because it can be a hassle to be seated. 2 is best or 4 they can usually manage.

Overall, I just go here for the cheap pork-bone soup ($6.99) which is addicting. Everything else is just average.

PS - Don't take home leftovers. Pork bone soup does not look appetizing the next day and my friend mentioned feeling ill after eating day-old pork bone meat."}
{"text":"OH NO, Ka Chi, what is happening here?

I have been to the Korea Town Ka Chi location probably 30+ times. I was in a Korean food mood (big surprise) on my way home from work so I stopped off at this location.

Upon first glance, I was pretty convinced that this location was superior to the Korea town one because it was a) bigger, spacious, b) slighter nicer decor/newer furnishings.

I should know better - love at first sight is merely an illusion. This Ka Chi really let me down because:

a) The food was sub-par (kimchijjigae was possibly the saddest I've ever eaten. Barely any meat. UNDERCOOKED rice. What kind of Asian restaurant can't cook rice properly, WTF!)

b) The place was NOT CLEAN. The table next to us sat for an hour full of dirty dishes and leftovers from someone else's meal. The restaurant was empty, there were 5-6 staff at hand dicking around, but none of them could be bothered to clean up dishes/wipe down tables?

c) Service was bad. They forget to bring my friend's rice then acted annoyed when we asked for it.

d) There was a SIGN saying that customers would be CHARGED $3 FOR EXTRA BANCHAN (side dishes) after 1 refill. What the bloody hell? I've eaten at over 20 different Korean places in Toronto and I've never seen them try to charge extra money for banchan refills. 

Ka-chiiiiiiiiiiiiiyaaaaaaaaa later, Ka chi"}
{"text":"New location! Kachi is now huge. 

Same staff, same food, same prices, same rock music playing in the background. They've even brought over the Van Gogh paintings from the old location.

Improved decor and much more tables and space - easier to get a table now as the old location was often full. Much nicer modern washrooms now as the building has housed various flopped restaurants over the past 5 years who had invested some money into modernizing. 

Cool."}
{"text":"Their pork bone soup is huge and tasty! Korean soups are tend to be salty..Unlike the other ones, their soup is not as salty and has less pepper n spice, but taste better. The restaurant is pretty spacious and located close to ttc station. I will go back again for their soup."}
{"text":"Clean place, attentive service, fresh ingredients. 

I am not a big fan of Korean food but this place was for me better than other (more authentic) places. Thus, I guess most of the items have been somehow Occidentalized for white people... a 4 but I am still not a big fan of Korean food..."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup here is pretty good.  I also like the reasonable prices.  I would say the service was ok, not the greatest.  The place was not busy when I went yet it took a long time to get my order, my food, and then the bill.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place a while ago, and recently I paid another visit. It was even better than I remembered. 

The traditional spread of complimentary Korean salads and pickles for appetizer was amazing. Each little dish was packed with flavor and well executed. The Kim Chi was deelish! 

I ordered the traditional Kam Ja Tang (Pork Bone Stew) and it was outstanding! It was flavorful, soulful and plentiful! The pork meat was piled high above the stone bowl. It was served with a side of perfectly cooked rice.

To wash down the delicious meal, a jug of very flavorful barley tea came complimentary with the meal.

It was quite a feast all for $7.95!!!"}
{"text":"This place is decent, not good or bad. I won't recommend and also won't against it if my firends wanted to go."}
{"text":"Ka Chi likes to play games with you.

They like to test out your take out order by one or all of the following:
-give you half of each dish you order
-no side dishes
-give you sriracha smeared raw cabbage as the only side dish
-make your food really salty
-make your food really bland

I don't know why I ordered from them 6 times. But I'm never ordering from them again."}
{"text":"What happened when I visited Ka Chi with two friends was appalling.  The owner made a HUGE SCENE. 

I'm not sure what his problem was, but he started yelling at these two young girls sitting at a nearby table. He was threatening an intimidating them. I was in shock that he would behave like that at all, let alone in his place of business which was packed with customers. The room went silent, everyone turned at looked at the two girls and the owner/manager yelling at them. He was pointing and waving his hands barely an inch from their faces. The girls looked very uncomfortable and did not say much back to him. They tried to speak quietly, but he kept yelling. He was being very aggressive. The servers looked embarrassed and just kept moving along. I got the impression that it was not the first time they had witnessed this type of incident. 

After about 5-10minutes of that awkward situation, the he just headed behind the bar, and gave the girls glaring looks. They left quickly, and surprisingly still paid their bill. I would have called the police if I were them. His behaviour clearly made EVERYONE UNCOMFORTABLE. 

The food was good and well price, which is unfortunate because I will never go back there.

I would not recommend this place since I do not think that such a wretched person should have their business supported. Also, I wouldn't risk witnessing that again only to have my stomach turning."}
{"text":"I ordered cold noodle and pork stew, but so disapponted with the taste and quality. I know they are offering cheap food but hope they can do better. The cold noodle is not cold enough, and the broth taste bland. pork stew tastes like they put alot of MSG. I'd better go to another place to have Korean food."}
{"text":"Ka Chi was the first Korean restaurant I've been to outside of Korean BBQs and I have to say that I do not regret it at all! 

The food was great! For my first time there, I went with my boyfriend and he order the Kimchi Fried Rice while I thought I ordered the basic BiBimBap but I actually ordered the Spicy Soft Tofu Stew (my bf's handwriting isnt the best, lol) and besides not getting what I wanted, the food was still great! 

There was a lot of people when we went and it seemed that everyone was enjoying their time and their food which created such a welcoming environment for us newcomers.

There really is no downside to the place; and we hope it stays that way for the next time we come back!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Kachis across Toronto. This one lives up to the franchise name.

Three words I'd use to describe Kachi in Chinatown:
1. Consistent
2. Fast
3. Polite

They offer similar menu choices as other Kachis. The food itself was good and consistent. I ordered the Kalbi (comes with rice) and seafood udon. They are priced fairly and have fair portions. Don't expect any gourmet food here because you're here for hearty traditional Korean food which is tasty and filling. That is what you pay for and that is what you'll get. It's perfect for students and anyone looking for a relatively cheap quick bite.

Fast - From seating to ordering to having food on your table, these guys don't kid around. We appreciated the servers willingness to replenish water and side dishes which is a huge factor for my preference in Korean restaurants.

The young man serving us was very polite. His English was functional and worked quickly despite all the tables he was waiting. I felt very comfortable eating there as we were never rushed and had ample time and space to eat.

Great spot to have a good quick meal with friends, family and lovers. Expect it to be like any other Kachi. I do want to mention that it doesn't compare to the more hip/bar style Kachi in Christie."}
{"text":"I visited here yesterday with a few of my friends. We are from the US and were in Toronto celebrating my birthday. I had never had authentic Korean food but we decided to give it a try. Everything was really good and the food came out fast. I was hesitant because I wasn't sure what to expect but everyone loved what they got. Great place!"}
{"text":"Great Korean food - Very affordable prices.
I've been to both Ka-Chi Locations(There's one located in Bloor st.) In my opinion this one is way better.. I've been going there for about 3 years now (especially during winter time). The food is always good, service is good and the price is right.. My favourite dish is the \"Kam ja tang\" which is Pork Bone Soup. Don't let the name fool you.. the dish is way more then a regular soup it's a full meal.  If you like spicy food make sure to order it spicy, otherwise go for mild.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Everything here is drool worthy. I always get the beef soon dobu, yukgaejang, budae chigae, kimchi fried rice or jajangmyun with a kimchi pajeon as an appetizer to share. DROOOLLL. Kimchi pajeon is filled with green onion and kimchi and super greasy but worth the carbs and calories. All of the stews are generous in portion and even more generous in meat/vegetables. :) If you like stew but don't really like tofu, yukgaejang changed my life. It's loaded with tender beef brisket, green onion and vegetables in a hearty and spicy soup. Soon dobu is filllled with vegetables like enoki mushrooms, green onion, mushrooms, tofu and egg. (Sometimes too much tofu though...) Budae Chigae tastes like soon dobu except with ramen noodles, sausage and spam. Kimchi fried rice is greasy carb goodness packed with kimchi and pork. All of the stews are eye catching because of all the colours/presentation and even better to eat."}
{"text":"The food here should probably be the bare minimum for Korea food.

The restaurant is rather spacious but the staff here is like 1 or 2 guys. They were pretty attentive though so I really have no complaints about the service.

The food is good, the pork bone is great after a night of drinking. I find that their spice levels have been significantly reduced over the years and sometimes they don't give you a potato. I asked for a potato once and although it was a strange request, they gave it to me (which was great, I really wanted that potato). The thing about the banchan (side dishes) though is that even if you have 4-6 people at your table, they'll only offer to refill it once before telling you they will charge. If you eat alone you get the same amount as one order so I've never been sure why they don't offer 6x refills for 6 people (OK I'm sure it has to do with money but still, it doesn't make sense).

Good food in a pinch."}
{"text":"I walked by earlier today and was intrigued by the sigh proclaiming \"best pork bone stew in Toronto\". I'd never heard of the dish. My experience with Korean food until know was BBQ beef and Kimchi. The photo of the dish and other items looked very appealing.  I read reviews and one reviewer was excited because the stew had a lot of bones. Not normally an ingredient one would want a lot of. 
By dinner I knew I had to try it. Good sized lower level restaurant.  The decor was not Asian but very nice. Not very busy at first but it picked up soon after I sat down. The staff is very pleasant. I ordered and my meal arrived after a brief wait. The portion is generous and comes with rice and five sides or add ins. Sprouted mung beans, glass noodles, kimchi, potatoes and seaweed. The bowl of stew was stacked high with bones in a reddish broth. The bones are from the spine and loaded with meat and gelatinous fat and sinew that melts in your mouth. Note: a lot of bones IS good. The broth is rich, bordering on gamey. Full of flavor and the heat builds as yo eat it. I started gnawing on the bones then progressed to using the chopsticks to strip the bones. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, generous portions, and friendly servers - what more can you ask for?

I had the jap chae and beef dolsot bibimbap, and both were really, really good. They lacked the oomph that makes good food great, but it was still pretty damn delicious. The 8 (eight!!) banchan were also pretty decent - I was half-full by the time I got through them all!

While the servers' English wasn't particularly good, they were all friendly and attentive. 

Also - they give banchan even when you order take-out!"}
{"text":"My favourite place in my neighbourhood. Hot plates are the best!!!! Prices are very good as well. I highly recommend the chicken hot plate (can't recall the name)."}
{"text":"Good food, largely authentic. I've had much better in other cities (particularly Seoul but that's cheating). If you're in Chinatown and need Korean food, this is the place to go.

This might be one of the best Korean restaurants in Toronto. The bi bim bap is sizzling hot, though as other reviewers have noted most have no egg. (Eggs aren't required, but they're nice!) The pork bone soup is not to be missed! The food's clean, the appetizers a nice variety of preserved yumminess, and it's all relatively cheap.

Ka Chi is slightly nicer than cafeteria atmosphere but it's has the typical adornments: garish wall decorations, large TVs, and a layout that ensures it will be noisy when crowded."}
{"text":"The spicy pork bul go gi bi bim bap in the hot stone bowl is delicious every time! I just had Seor Ak San's version of that dish and can definitely tell the difference -- Ka Chi's ingredients are superior and thus is the flavour! 

The soft tofu and pork soup (featured in one of the Yelp photos) is also tasty.

The standard sides usually leave quite a lot to be desired and their kimchi side is not very good. 

Stick to the staple dishes, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Talk about disappointing! It turns out we went to the wrong Ka Chi because this one was terrible. The bibimbap was mediocre- the rice soft and the beef bland. The dehydrated mushrooms they use also don't taste very good. The side dishes were mostly bland too. You have many other good options for Korean food in the Chinatown area."}
{"text":"Service:
Most of the servers working there don't speak fluent English. I usually just point on the item I want from the menu.

Ambiance:
They used to be in a smaller location on Bloor, but recently moved to this bigger spot. It's pretty spacious and clean compared to most Asian restaurants on the strip. The only thing I felt weird about this new renovation is that it's a Korean restaurant with a sports bar look and feel, but they play classic jazz music in the background. lol

Food:
It hits the spot every time, and the prices are reasonable. I usually order the pork bone soup, where the meat falls off the bone. They also have a combo option for that, where it comes with a drink."}
{"text":"not one of the best bibimbaps I have had, I dpn't use spicy sauce and some others still had more flavour. brought quite fast, portion was adequately sized, appetizers were also okay. hisband was happy with the same meal, he eats spicy sauce so flavour is hardly an issue for him. reasonably priced although one of higher priced ones. not sure I'd return just because there are so many options to check out out there."}
{"text":"Update: I went back last night with my sister and what a difference! We had a spicy beef rice dish, galbi and spicy bulgogi and it was awesome. 

The televisions were off and you could have a conversation - you could hear yourself think! One of the things that I really like about this location is how clean it is. You can see that they take a lot of pride in how the environment looks. 

The food was delicious and even tho the prices were marked down from what they were before it was still a little bit expensive. Honestly tho - not expensive enough where we cried about it; so I'm cool with that! 

The service was great; our wait staff was super nice and polite and didn't overwhelm us. We got 4 side dishes and soup which is standard and reasonable. 

Most importantly tho - the flavours were on point. There was definitely a misstep at the outset with Ka Chi but this second time around, months later was hella on point! We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The side dishes were great. The service was fast and friendly but I was disappointed in the quality of the jajamyung and the beef Bulgogi. Ordered Bulgogi and it was mostly gristle/fat shavings which was barely any meat and lots of cabbage and onion."}
{"text":"Love the decor of this place, paintings and cute lit chandeliers.

Food is average quality. Could be better."}
{"text":"Though the atmosphere is good for hanging out with friends for a drink, I find the food to be really salty. I have given it a try for the second time and it hasn't really changed much. 

Definitely a place I would not recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"The kam ja tang (pork bone soup) here was soooo good and perfect for a chilly fall night. The restaurant was pretty full when we came last Friday and there were only two servers, so although service was friendly, it was pretty slow. Apparently they give you a piece of paper along with your menus to write your order on, but my friend and I were too busy talking and didn't notice it sitting on our table...so we thought the servers weren't paying attention to us for the longest time when we were actually supposed to just write our orders down and wait for them to take it haha. Oops. 

Anyway, the food! We both got the normal spicy kam ja tang. Broth was delicious and not too too spicy (which is what I like), and there were giant pieces of tender and juicy bone-in pork as well as lots of bean sprouts and cabbage on top. Comes with rice and banchan which was great as well. Including tax and tip, it came to about $10-$11. Can't wait to come back, especially as the weather gets colder!"}
{"text":"Nice food. I love the cold wheat and buckwheat noodle. The stir fry rice cake is great too!"}
{"text":"Can I give this place zero stars? My friend and I walked in and the waiter told us that the kitchen was closed. We were disappointed but wanted to check out the drinks. We sat and briefly checked out the menu but they didn't have what we were looking for. We apologized, handed the menu back, and headed for the exit. The waiter (I think his name is Jason) called us \"byung shin\" which translates to retard/ mentally handicapped. Very professional. Won't be going back until they train their staff."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a sunny Friday with the family.  We were walking  in Chinatown intending to eat Chinese.  However, could not find one that ranked high enough on Yelp to interest us.  We passed a Ka Chi on our way through Chinatown.  And, was surprised to see another Ka Chi near Kensington Market.  It yelped fine.

Upon entering from outside, it initially felt a lot cooler.  However, we eventually noticed two fans and what seemed like a slowly rising temperature.  We ordered nem yong (cold noodle dish), california roll & spicy tuna roll bento, and two bulgogi bentos.  My kids and I ordered sodas to help cool down while my wife ordered water (in a bottle).  The bottle was unique and like nothing I've seen before but I'm from Virginia-US visiting Canada.

We were in time for their lunch specials.  So the price was quite reasonable and we were satisfied with their portions.  We all enjoyed the food and it was a nice respite from a long painful walk.  We had visited Casa Loma prior to visiting Chinatown and I think the stairs and walking there took a lot more out of us than we expected.  Another place that I recommend however."}
{"text":"Came here after a great foot massage a few doors down. It took a while to get seated but they were clearly shortstaffed; the service turned out to be courteous and unobtrusive.

I originally came in for kimchi fried rice - I liked how you can choose what meat to get. But after having 2 so-spicy-I-almost-cried kimchi fried rices in Koreatown (I have a wimpy foreigner's palate), I decided to play it safe and get the gam ja tang, because they have a mild version.

It was very, very good! The broth was very meaty and rich without being greasy (unlike ramen broths), it was very flavourful, and there was plenty of meat in there, with a good helping of veggies (large bean sprouts and enoki mushrooms, I believe). The rice was a little overcooked, but I didn't mind too much.

The banchan were some of the best I'd had! There was fresh kimchi (so it wasn't sour and wasn't too spicy either, come to think of it), a refreshing seaweed salad (that wasn't too sugary or acidic, like at many other places), japchae made of flat, wide glass noodles that kind of reminded me of Chinese ho fun, a DELICIOUS cooked eggplant concoction, and this weird crunchy kelp. I originally looked at the kelp with some trepidation because it had bubbles on its surface - it looked almost like beetle wings, but in long wide strips. To my delight, it was crunchy and actually quite tasty - both sweet and savoury and soy-y at the same time.

The gam ja tang tasted very salty as it cooled down, but it was just right when it was hot. 

I'd come back for sure (if not this location, maybe some of the other many ones they have in Toronto). And hopefully next time I'll be brave enough to try their kimchi fried rice!"}
{"text":"After taking a film nerd through Mirvish Village, I was famished. Do you know how long a movie geek can hang tough in Suspect or Vintage Video? Long. The answer is long. 

I didn't have to look far for massive Ka Chi, and in that moment I didn't even check my trusty Yelp app... I just walked like a zombie towards soju, fried dumplings and a beef hot pot. All excellent. Ka Chi has ordering on lock. The menu is massive, you write down your order for them, and they're back with your endless tiny sides in record time. Generally, I prefer the more hole-in-the-wall K town joints, but Ka Chi's hot pot really hit the spot."}
{"text":"I've been tempted to come up to the waitress and emulate whipping a horse while on a horse stance and ask Do you know Gangnam Style? Neah...I'd get my balls handed to me.

The bulgogi and spicy chicken bibimbap here was good. Very filling.  I also enjoyed Ka Chi. Try their soup and their Kalbi as well. The place is spacious enough for a big group of people doing 'Gangman Style\"."}
{"text":"oh how I love Ka Chi, they have become my go to Korean restaurant especially when I'm in need of a great pork bone soup. They have by far the best pork bone soup I have had and its just what I need on many a cold winters days. As much as I love that soup I have ventured off and tried other items from the menu and from what I have tried I have always been very pleased. Great seafood pancakes and delicious bibimbap and I have also tried their Bul Go Gi and it was great as well. 

Great place and glad to work near by, it has become one of my regular spots."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place has good reviews. Went for the first and last time today. The service was terrible. The food was mediocre. The bibim bap was good. Certainly not the best I've had. Asked for onions. The server asked the kitchen and told us they don't have them. We all know that's BS. But ok. Whatever. Then the staff proceeds to eat their lunch at the table behind us. A full plate of onion. As we packed up and went to leave, one woman yelled across the restaurant from behind the cash \"you didn't pay!\"  yes. I did. But instead of my usual 25% tip, I tipped 15%. I'm appalled at the effort it takes for a restaurant to be so absolutely worthless."}
{"text":"I actually liked the food! I had the seafood udon because I was craving something warm with soup. The udon was flavourful and the soup was soooo delicious.

Other foods were amazing too! Their bibimbap was really yummy.

Then I had like an upset stomach after finishing about half the bowl... so... I'm scared now"}
{"text":"I didn't really expect much coming to Ka-Chi so maybe that's why I'm so pleasantly surprised.  I know there are a couple locations around town but I never got around to trying Ka-Chi until now because I was in the area for work. 

I ordered a dolsoht bibimbap, co-worker ordered the kamjatang, and we decided to share a seafood pancake. The banchan took a while to come and actually came at the same time as the pancake. It would've been nice to have it earlier to nibble on. 

I was really happy with the kimchi seafood pancake - it came out crispy, not thick and doughy like others I've had in town, and had lots of seafood in the way of squid. There may have been one or two shrimp and no mussels or clams. I'm perfectly ok with no mussels and clams because I would've picked them all out anyway :D but just FYI. Overall , it was great and I'd want to try their other pancakes.

The dolsoht bibimbap was a winner here - real  bulgogi and lots of it! I ordered the spicy version too so it had a good kick. I also added the sauce. The bowl was piled nicely with a variety of the usual (shrooms, sprouts, radish, carrot, cucumber). The only minus is that they bowl didn't sizzle hot enough and the rice on the bottom didn't get a nice crunchy burnt layer.  (NOTE: I came back a week later and requested for the bowl to be left longer and got my nice crunchy rice layer!)

I didn't try the kamjatang but apparently there were lots of bones, not as much meat as some other places. 

All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again if I was in the area."}
