{"text":"The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere. All of the staff were pleasant and friendly.
If your looking for a nice relaxing restaurant Sara's is definitely worth considering. 
The food was excellent. The portions were more then adequate and, in what is becoming an increasing rarity these days, the meal was served piping hot."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch OR dinner.  It sits right across the street from the river, has fantastic Pasta Carbonara - although my hubby loves the white bean soup.  Great wine selection - even had Cakebread."}
{"text":"Love this place... It is charming anytime of year. I visit Sara's often and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The setting is lovely.  The food is so average that I wonder what everyone is doing there.  I have eaten there  many times and each time is more disappointing and costly.  Such a waste for a great space."}
{"text":"I am adding to Clifton H's review about our visit on Mothers Day.  I am his mom & we had his grandma with us too. It was quite a drive for us to get here which was very scenic. Although, as he said the appetizer was very good, the service was very odd & disappointing, almost embarrassing. My mom also was disappointed to be seated upstairs in a very small room as we did have a reservation in advance. As we watched the fighting unfold and sat for a very long time for our drink order to be taken,(I actually had to get up & ask if we could please order as others who came after us were already waited on), my son got busy on his phone looking for another restaurant to go to as he decided to cut this visit short & not have dinner here in these circumstances. We drove all the way to Little Italy to one of our favs, Washington Place, to have dinner in the patio. We should have went there in the first place & had a great evening after all. 
I have been talking about trying Sarah's Place for a very long time & did not expect this to happen. Not sure if we should give it one more try?"}
{"text":"I do wish the uninformed interlopers would finally learn that it's  pronounced \"saaaahra's\".

During the day  it's ladies who lunch, who I adore. Triple initial vanity plates. Hunt club stickers. Benefit chairs and committee gossip. A quilted Barbour and Jimmy Choo flats.

The bar upstairs is a hoot at happy hour, skewing more towards the nouveau (north of Mayfield) locals. 

Oh, and they serve food also."}
{"text":"Bean soup with hot sauce - incredible
Coffee always hot and fresh
Arugula salad and wheat bread - all excellent"}
{"text":"Great Place.  Just celebrated my daughter's senior commenement with family."}
{"text":"We were certainly happy to have found a nice place like Saras not too far from us until we experienced service the other day.
First of all service is not consistent. You are either lucky and have a friendly and good server or you end up with one who does not seem to care at all or on top charges you food and drinks you never had! We called them to correct that ( please understand it is not about the amount it is only about the fact that this should not happen and we don't have the time to check the bill)
but they had all kinds of explanations. For what? Listen, I did not have the salad or the wine you charged me! 
Nobody had the courtesy to correct that. Well this way I do not feel appreciated and certainly will make different choices for lunch and for dinner next time as you guys obviously don't need any additional business!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. It was so good! Eggplant was perfect! My mom had the chicken pot pie and she enjoyed it as well. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great environment and food.  Frequently stop in for dinner and lunch last minute and always very accommodating.  The white bean soup is exceptional as is the stuffed banana peppers.  The rack of lamb with mint glaze is also great and a large selection of salads.

The upstairs is more laid back with a bar and accommodates larger parties."}
{"text":"Big Fan of this place! The stuffed Banana Peppers and Mussels are great here! Also best Chicken Pot Pie ive had! Service is always attentive and a good fun crowd. Will be back as we really like this place!"}
{"text":"Nice location in the village of Gates Mills. Decor is comfortable and less formal than expected.

Drinks were good. Italian food was above average but a little bland."}
{"text":"This place has a great relaxing atmosphere.  We went for lunch today and thoroughly enjoyed everything!  I had the chicken stir fry and it was the perfect portion size for lunch, and the bread was also delicious. This is a great place to enjoy a relaxing lunch anytime of the year."}
{"text":"Sara's Place is wonderful!  Food was excellent and the  service exceptional.  I had the Israeli Couscous with lemon chicken.  Very tasty!  My daughter loved the bacon cheddar burger.  I also had the creme brulee for dessert. Very yummy!  The menu is very diverse.  They also have desserts from Corbos Bakery and Mitchell's Ice Cream."}
{"text":"Visiting the area at relatives over the Thanksgiving holiday, we ventured out on Friday and found Sara's Place. Super cute! We had a party of 12, and the service and food were great. Very cozy decor. Nice for a date or with friends/family. I'll go there again next visit!"}
{"text":"Went recently and ordered the Mikey's salad on the menu.  The red onions completely overpowered the salad so I was bummed!!  Otherwise always - great service."}
{"text":"The hubby and I love this restaurant!!  The martini's and wine list are great and the food is even better!  The pasta carbonara is to die for!!  It's the perfect little date night location!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best restaurant I have ever gone, great customer service, great staff with reasonable price. It is in the great area of Cleveland and lots of picturous places around. Nice river and great green arena."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous lunch. Very nice atmosphere and located in a very picturesque setting. I had the Red Raspberry Quinoa Salad for lunch and the homemade peach pie for dessert. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a fine dinning experience. Enjoyed the very cosy and friendly atmisphere. Food and wine selections were amazing. Special thanks to Nan for taking such good care. Will definately recommend this place.
Thx

{"text":"Ask yourself: do you want to pay a little extra for beautiful ambiance, higher class food, and a full upscale dining experience? If so, you'll adore Sara's. The food was great and very memorable (my husband is still talking about his marsala dish). And the wine list was great. Best moscato I've ever had. The only thing I can fault them for is that price, while paying for the amazing view on that patio, is still a bit much for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I have to go out at strange times because of arranging child care so we are limited as to where we can go ( getting home to get kids in bed and all that).  We were looking for something new for us and relatively close and Sara's looked like it would be a great option!  We were celebrating our wedding anniversary so this was suppose to be a special meal.

We were \"greeted\" by the waiter who pointed us in the general direction of some tables and explained he would be over with menu's in a minute. It is a very cute place that's not too dimly lit and being one of three tables at the place, it wasn't too loud or anything.  

After several minutes we were give menus. While I did hear the waiter talk to another table about specials, we were never told about any.  I did hear EXTENSIVELY about the issues the staff were having as they were all going on about this, that and the other the entire meal.  I watch our waiter pass our table (I counted) 7 times before he asked if we had questions or were ready to order. 

The food:  
Lasagna roll- Flavorful but with a bit to heavy a sauce. NOT with the $9 price tag. 

Beet Salad- I think this was the best part of the meal. Very good flavor an presentation.

Mac-and-Cheese-  No, I'm not a kid but it looked like a dressed up version. I had chicken added as well. The sauce while not as orange as Kraft was just as runny.  Not at all what I would expect for a $19 dish.  Portion size was very large.

Mediterranean Pasta- Not bad. Again, large portion. I've seen this same thing done over and over and while they did it well it wasn't anything spectacular.

Cream Brûlée-  Plunking on large strawberry on top isn't the best presentation I've ever seen. Again with a $9 price tag, I wouldn't get it again.

Skillet Cookie with a shot of milk- This pretty much tasted like a Toll House cookie that was cooked in a cupcake tin. It was pretty hard and I didn't finish it.

Coffee- Now I realize it was about 3 in the afternoon but when the server poured our cups and then immediately take the thermos' to the back you know it's been sitting there most likely all day. It was terrible and we spent $2.75 for 2 cups we couldn't even drink. 




Service- As I said we were one of 4 tables in the place. There was one initial server then 2-3 more came in.  I have NEVER had such bad service. It was like we weren't even there. While we were eating our desserts the server dropped off the check because he had other things to do.  

As we were leaving, I saw Orlando Baking Company bread (garlic bread and the rolls like we had been served)  sitting in the window.  Really?  At an Italian restaurant you would think they would make bread. I feel like if they are serving store bought bread, what else was basically reheated?"}
{"text":"I love Sara's Place. It's a place where I've never had a meal that I've not enjoyed. 

I greatly appreciate a restaurant that makes soups, salad dressings and sauces from scratch as they do at Sara's. The Tuscan White Bean Soup is outstanding and if you are in need of a bowl of comfort, have the chicken and rice. It's just like the chicken and rice soup your grandmother made when you were not feeling well. 

The eggplant rolls are perfect with a sauce as good as my own, same with the meatballs. 

I've had and enjoyed most of the salads. In addition to house made dressings, it makes me happy that you can order a smaller version of any salad for a reduced price to accompany your meal. I'm particularly a fan of the Tomato Corn and Shrimp salad and appreciate that they use Laughing Bird shrimp, the only good farmed shrimp there is, instead of frozen shrimp that's been treated with preservatives as most other places use. Their Chagrin Chopped salad is perfect as is the Pete's Chopped salad. 

Favorite entrées have been the Israeli Cous Cous with Grilled Tofu, Roasted Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie. 

The prices are appropriate for the quality of food that they deliver. 

The service has always been warm and friendly and I've noticed that they have had the same service and kitchen staff for years. That says a lot about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy smokes is this place awesome!! Came here last night with my parents for a pre-birthday celebration and I loved every minute of the meal. My martini was made to perfection, the filet was outstanding and perfectly cooked and the mussels were so savory and delicious. After our server cleared our plates, we were hoping to order dessert and she must have overheard us say it was my birthday this weekend, so she surprised us all and came out with a mini cake! I'm not sure what kind of cake it was...tasted and looked like red velvet cake but way better! I highly recommend coming here for a birthday or special occasion."}
{"text":"Awful food. Made the mistake of thinking the food was good. I gave it two stars because the ambiance is nice. I wouldn't go back. Prices would be ok if the restaurant was clean. Our waitress was trying to hide a stain n the drinks menu on our table. Apparently they never heard of windex My family was laughing at me for cleaning the table. But I got some veal stuffed pasta shells. The sauce was making me sick so I asked the waitress to move it from the table so my family could enjoy their chicken pot pie. The beef brisket was even a brisket cut (what someone else ordered). I felt bad for the fact we were celebrating s birthday. They also told us they were full dining that evening and half the tables were empty? 

Now I know why I've never heard of the place and it's 5 minutes away from home."}
{"text":"The place is nice, cozy, clean and the food is pretty good. My only issue is it's too expensive."}
{"text":"I can't fathom why I don't check in when I'm here every month, at least once.

The bartenders and servers are no less than crafty, courteous and personally professional! 

Sarah, Amy and Nan can make one with very best! I also enjoy good conversation with them especially when I can sit at the upstairs bar.

Happy Hour is on point M-F, so try not to miss it... you can dine very reasonably. ..or you can dine off of the main menu and or daily specials. .. never had anything I did not completely enjoy...down to the last bite!

Excellent for groups or parties, but on the main floor.
Upstairs is crowded with regulars and locals, but all I have met are a joy and great conversation! 

I'll see ya there on a Wednesday  most likely because the cocktails are only $6 vs $12... then I can eat more!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great time!  We went there on NYE for dinner.  Had a reservation.  Food was great (I had filet) but a little slow due to NYE.  I normally do not go there otherwise, but will try again soon.   

The valet attendants were polite, have a coatcheck.  Kinda pricey though."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant two stars; one for the service and one for the location/ambiance.  It is a nice building located in downtown Gates Mills but unfortunately the food is very poor and overpriced.  I chose to dine here recently as my family wanted to take me out for my birthday and I'm sad to say we were all disappointed in the food.  My brother was excited to try an unusual pasta dish but he disliked it so much he didn't finish it and wanted it removed from the table. If an Italian restaurant can't get pasta right its generally not a good sign.  My wife did not care for her nearly $20 pot pie either and could have gotten a better one at Bob Evans for $6.  I ordered brisket which was rather bland and basically just a pot roast. I felt bad because my family paid good money to treat me for a special occasion and nobody was satisfied. There are several other much better options for Italian in the area that are a much better value. Most dishes were $20 and up and that's not including a salad, which is price gouging for your average Italian restaurant.  Its unfortunate because if they could get the food right it would be a nice place to go for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Could live on this!!  Sour cream was infused with lime and cauliflower pancakes included a side of guacamole. It was an appetizer but perfect for lunch!!!  For dinner I'll just have two!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this quaint and charming restaurant. We eat there often but in the past found the dinners to be hit or miss but the past year the food and service has been consistently good. Last week my wife and I had lunch. I had the spinach sausage pasta which was outstanding and we both ordered half caesars salads which were as big as a large and they had anchovies, excellent. Service was very attentive."}
{"text":"The food is nothing special, but the location is nice and the ambiance is nice.  The food is overpriced for the quality.  We continue to go there because it is convenient to Gates Mills where we live.  We had not been there for awhile because the last time, the food was mediocre.  We tried again tonight and there was a table of 8 adults and their 4 noisy, screaming children had their own table.  We were told the restaurant was allowing it because these people were frequent diners there. It ruined our dining experience and that of other tables and to make it worse, when they left, the grandfather gave us his middle finger when he left.  A classy place?  I think not.  This sort of thing would not happen at a Chagrin Blvd restaurant.   Again, the food was only OK.  We have been here many times and this was the last straw.  Avoid this mediocre place."}
{"text":"Set aside the \"Eating at a restaurant in Gates Mills\" and you have bad food and fair service at a stratospheric price. $120 dollars for a rubber chicken/ soggy vegetable dish and a pasta dish with no drinks.  I guess that was my mistake, If I was half in the bag I would have enjoyed it more.  I have dined there on three separate occasions and rubber chicken seems to be their specialty both in house and catered. 
Bob Evans is a better choice and you can dine there for 1/3 the price.
Gamekeeper 2 would have been a better choice that a Gavi's rehash.
BTW is SARA's  not SAAARA's  just because you elongate/emphasis the long A doesn't mean its not CRAAAP."}
{"text":"I dined alfresco today and had a delicious beet salad with blackened chicken.  The service was friendly and efficient.  The weather couldn't have been better and the annoying bees were not present, since they hide until late July or August.  This place has its regulars-for good reason. It is not inexpensive, but the quality of the food is top notch."}
{"text":"Okay, after writing a glowing review about how good the food was and how accommodating they were of my food allergies, I have been unable to get a table after several attempts. Tonight, on a Monday, they said they might be able to get us in at 5:30 but we would have to leave by 7. Nice! (On my birthday no less.) I like Sara's, but not that much. Not at all anymore in fact...they seem to be solidly occupied by regulars, which makes this more like an exclusive club than a restaurant. I am going to save myself from being snubbed and take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was an amazing little place with wonderful food and a great ambiance. The service was top notch and the food was amazing. I would highly recommend dinning at his fine establishment. 

The beef short ribs were great and the bread pudding as heavenly. My favorite thing about this location is that you're in a neighborhood not some strip mall or a stuffy restaurant chain."}
{"text":"It's in a cute little town center attached to the library. There's a pedestrian bridge nearby that goes over the river. I went with my grandmother, and we had a great time. The food was comforting and delicious. The staff was attentive and kind. Might want to get a reservation. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very good experience. The atmosphere is hard to beat as it is a nice divergent from many noisy and less intimate options. Our food was outstanding. I had the steak which was one of several specials. One of the best I've had. We met the owner ( Dave) who was gracious and genuine. Staff was superb. We will definitely be back. Well done!"}
{"text":"I would really rate this two and a half, and I was tempting to leave it as just three. The three ish comes from the location, service, and ambiance. 

1. It's a hidden away little gem from town and to walk the street and visit the arboretum not far away is worlds away from mayfield heights which is only 5-10 minutes away. 2. The people serving us and seating us were all friendly, knowledgable about the history of the restaurant and the menu. Service was prompt too. 3 ish. Everything feels very clean, the lights are dim and the decor is appealing with plenty of Windows to look at the sleepy little town. 

The bad . . . 

For what you get the prices are a bit obscene. I will not come here again. The bread before our meal was very hard and nugget like. For an Italian place that was very much a let down. The meals themselves were of decent size. My boyfriend ordered the southwest salad with grilled chicken. The presentation was great. But when you at it, it was just underwhelming. You know those little lunch salad bowls you can buy at giant eagle for 4 bucks? Yeah . . . Tasted exactly like their tortilla salad one. Exactly. My dish, as a woman who loves cooking, disappointed me the most. I order the stuffed cabbage which the waitress assured me was an original recipe from the original restaurant. The veggie of the night was asparagus, but who ever prepared it didn't know what they were doing. When you make asparagus, before cooking you bend the ends to take off the bitter tough ends of the stalks. They didn't do that. I had rough ends to chew on, some that even splintered when I bit down. It also was grilled absolutely plain. No seasoning what so ever. Bland. The potatoes it was served with? Whipped well, but you guessed it, bland. The stuffed cabbage it self was very simply prepared. But there was nothing impressive about the meat inside. It was neither tender nor particularly flavorful. I just . . . I hate writing bad reviews, and rarely give twos, but this was just a disappointment across the board with the food. We were going to get a dessert and opted out despite how nice some of the options sounded."}
{"text":"I recently attended a work dinner here while visiting Cleveland.  They had our party set up in one of their private rooms upstairs and the service was phenomenal.  I wasn't sure what to expect driving up on this place, but I was very impressed with the scenery and location where this restaurant is located. A refreshing change to the usual strip malls or busy roads where you would find typical restaurants.

We had a particular server assigned to our reserved room and she was on the ball with making sure drink orders were topped off and even helped with recommendations for entrees for those of us who had never been there before.  The stuffed banana peppers on the appetizer menu were to die for and still have me craving some weeks later.  I ordered the couscous with chicken and was very impressed with the flavors and portion sizes.  This is definitely the place to go if you are looking for an upscale meal or an intimate dinner location."}
{"text":"This has been our favorite restaurant since moving to Cleveland. Prices are very reasonable, we are foodies on a budget so when not going to a high end place we love coming here. The staff is always great and free valet is awesome. We have tried probably 75% of the menu so far and not had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"Love the mac and cheese! Very cute place hidden in Gates Mills! Really small parking lot that is kind of frustrating. Very expensive menu too. However, they always give great service and the food is always fresh with no complaints. Not a very large menu and I wouldn't recommend bringing kids honestly. Not a place you would go out to dinner regularly, more so for special occasions. Would definitely recommend to people who want a guaranteed great meal with great service and are willing to pay the price."}
{"text":"Sara's Place is a wonderful restaurant for all occasions... From an impromptu lunch to a celebratory engagement party or rehearsal dinner, the food, quality & service are up to par every time. I was shocked by the poor reviews as I have been following Mary & Dave Gromelski's restaurants for 15 years and have never been disappointed. If you are looking for a consistently good meal, whether it's their fabulous 4 cheese stuffed eggplant roll or fish special of the day, you just can't go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here while in Ohio on business. The neighborhood surrounding the restaurant is beautiful. I ate there early on a Monday night so the restaurant was pretty quiet. The Tuscan bean soup that I had heard so much about was ok. Maybe it was hyped too much? My entree was excellent. I ordered the fish special. It was cooked well and served over delicious mashed potatoes with asparagus. The service was very good. Even the valet introduced himself. I will go back the next time I am in Ohio."}
{"text":"So yummy! Miss the old Gavi's so this is definitely a good alternative since it's owned and operated by the same people.  Delicious food! I had the Carmelles which are delicious little bites of heaven and my boyfriend had the Chicken Pot Pie.  All of which was so great had many layers of flavor and was seasoned just right.  We also had the Spicy Bacon Pizza which was divine.  If you go there you will not be disappointed.  Great romantic spot and the drive to get there is beautiful too!"}
{"text":"The problem with Sara's is the food is so great and
plentiful I swear I need to skip a week or run a few miles.  And there I am returning very soon. 
The menu is large and has a lot of variety.  I could dine there for months and order something different every time.  This is \"real\" food.  Try the Beans and Greens, you will be happy."}
{"text":"Sara's place is great. The ambiance is great for a dinner with friends, family, a boyfriend/girl friend. It is dimly lit and decorated nicely. I have not dined in the main dining room but it seems to attract a lot of people. I generally dine in the bar area on the second floor. It's small and cozy with a small bar and probably 10 or so small tables. 

So far my favorite things I've tried is the Beans and Greens. Sounds so simply and it is - but it is SOOOOO good. I promise you won't regret it. I have driven there 30 minutes each way fro take out to satisfy my craving for it. I've also had the Caesar Salad, Arugula/ Tomato salad, and Mussels. I'm not big on anchovy so I did not enjoy the Caesar at all. But everything else has been great. I look forward to trying more things off the menu."}
{"text":"Had dinner Saturday night at Sara's and it was excellent.  We ate at the bar and it was a very pleasant evening.  The server was attentive and keep up with a very busy evening. I enjoyed a great salad special and my wife had Pete's salad which is always great. Our entrees were excellent, one pasta dish and the other Veal Milanese.   Definitely a place to enjoy an evening."}
{"text":"Nice place, very good service, waitress was very friendly and let us enjoy a meal at our pace and did not rush us!  Food was very good.  Good wine selection.  Obviously a popular local place. I would go again.  They just need to clean the white doors in/around the restaurant, kinda dirty looking."}
{"text":"This place is fancy as it gets. Even the bar upstairs make me feel like I need a sport coat. But the staff is friendly and fantastic and the food is delicious. LOVE their taco Mondays and love the quiet upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sara's Place is the sort of place you want to have a relaxing dinner at. There aren't too many tables, the room has a warm atmosphere and the staff is friendly. In the summer you can enjoy a leisurely lunch out on their patio. With dining rooms upstairs this is a great venue for a private party too.

The portions are tremendous. On two visits I've wondered how in the world I'm going to eat so much...especially when the food has come and it's been OK but nothing all that special. 

Most recently I enjoyed my appetizer - a spinach, bean and sausage dish ($12) served warm with points of thick bread. I should have shared this with someone but I did enjoy it. The entrees are decent but again I kept wondering if the chef had swapped out the ingredients if some of their items could have been better. It's not that things aren't fresh, I just am not crazy about their combination of items. The macaroni & cheese ($16) is a customer favorite. I love to try this dish and restaurants and was disappointed. Sure anyone can toss some pasta with marscapone and top the dish with some shredded cheese. The dish had no depth. I've ordered the chicken pot pie ($16) before as well and had a similar experience.

I do give them credit for their healthy eating section of the menu and for offering many items in half portion sizes. If you're looking for an intimate dining area and want to spend your time relaxing over large portions of food than give Sara's a try. I'll probably be back in the winter but will remember that I shouldn't have such high expectations for their menu."}
{"text":"Great service, warm environment and fantastic food says it all. We share wine, salads all had fantastic entrees. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick you quick lunch salads with friend. Sat outside in the patio even though the inside was empty.. Outside was kind of dirty plenty of spider webs around ,  and my plate was dirty .Staff was quick and responsive about plate but Salads were ordered with chicken which was of course extra, no problem there but the salads were nothing to write home about for the price very chincy in what was in them and size. Then to top it off , when I got the check I noticed the one salad was charged extra couple bucks for the chicken than the other one and from what the menu said, When i asked the waitress she said \" oh sometime the pricing is different then whats on the menu\"  REALLY , I said well that's not correct she went to check on it while taking my credit card then charged my card before clarifying the menu was wrong. I said ok. your menu is wrong but don't worry about it. Be sure to check what they charge you...."}
{"text":"A friend recommended having dinner at Sara's and it turned out to be a real gem.  The restaurant is tucked away in a very scenic mid-19th century town in a country setting.  The ambience inside is realy nice and lends itself to a comfortable stay.  The food was excellent.  We ordered chicken parmesan, veal parmesan, eggplant parmesan, chicken marsala, and a couple pizzas.  Those who had the pizza and parmesan dishes (including me) all raved about them.  Only the marsala dish fell a bit flat.

Food aside, the service has been excellent the two times I've eaten here."}
{"text":"I've said it before but I just have to say it again, Lisa makes the best Martini I've ever had! Evan can talk fly fishing with you all night and Nan looks out for everyone all the time. These people really care about their customers. It's always nice to relax with our friends at Sara's."}
{"text":"Very odd experience at Sara's Place... After hearing so many positive reviews I made a reservation for dinner. The area is beautiful and the restaurant is situated in a neat \"downtown\" area of Gates Mills I didn't know existed. However upon entering and checking in, we were told to head upstairs as that's where we were being seated. The upstairs dining area in my opinion isn't as nice as downstairs, although there is a nice bar in the room. The staff upstairs was confused from the moment we got there, then the waiter and bartender proceeded to carry out a very heated argument which lasted the entire visit. Between them and the manager who kept coming up to check on the situation, it made for a very uncomfortable situation. There were obviously some major staff issues going on and we decided to just get an appetizer and cut our meal short. To summarize: the mussels we ordered were actually quite good and therefore two stars. The drinks were made incorrectly. The staff was fighting in front of the guests. It was a holiday and a day they are not usually open, but that doesn't excuse the unprofessional behavior. I will give it one more try another time."}
{"text":"A contemporary crisp, yet warm atmosphere is Sara's place.  Recently a group dined here at lunch.  Nice presentation.  Skip the Mac & Cheese:  really a penne pasta with a thin cheese sauce, not baked with a crisp crust as one would expect.  

The other sandwiches looked good.  Our waiter had a mix up with two of the other orders and it was a slow day.  

We will return, it's a beautiful drive to get there, just don't get your hopes up for food to match the scenery.  

Parking in the Post Office lot will result in excessive indignation or even a tow, even though there are no signs posted.  Gates Mills charm, I suspect."}
