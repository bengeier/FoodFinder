{"text":"Great customer service, but the food was just ok. Got the bulgogi which came with a side of white rice. Bulgogi was watery and lacked flavor."}
{"text":"The soon tofu has no flavor and tastes very bland. Their other food is very sweet. There are better options in Phoenix. They don't have the full menu that is advertised on the building. They only give kimchee as banchan (side dish)."}
{"text":"Had the crispy chicken wings which were delicious. We ordered two flavors- soy and honey butter. I think the soy was more flavorful but both were good and we'd order them again.  Just FYI- the honey butter had chopped garlic on top which we didn't expect but still enjoyed."}
{"text":"Food not good customer service so bad never comeback  The guy is cooking so so Lack of politeness when talking to guests"}
{"text":"We came here dinner and surprised at the Korean spots around Mesa.   Ordered fried chicken wings, spicy chicken and the katsu.   The katsu dish is the signature and very juicy and awesome katsu sauce.  A little weird because I thought katsu was Japanese, but whatever.  The wings were tasty, the spicy wings are the solid but over sauced.    Satisfied and plenty of sitting and space for the kids to run around."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to be open for a while as it's been an empty stall ever since the supermarket has been open. The main thing I ordered was the chicken wings with the korean chili sauce aka the gochuchang sauce. Aka the best sauce ever. They also had a honey sauce too and I'll most likely get it next time. You get 6 wings for like I think 8-9$? The seafood tofu soup, and an omurice to pair it with. The omurice was a large portion so make sure you bring a small family otherwise you can be the small family and dominate it. The omurice was good, the fried rice gets kinda tiring after a while. The only way I can describe it is with a vietnamese word: \"ngang\" ( butchered spelling). The sauce on the omurice isn't the typical demiglace/gravy.. but rather a orange colored tangy sauce. Honestly threw me off cause it reminds me of a hot/tangy sauce that I would eat with a burrito. This is a great place to share some food with your friends - if you have any."}
{"text":"I tried here finally!!! It took forever for them to open. We tried omurice and honey butter fried chicken wing. Both of them were pretty good and the omurice was large enough for 2people. I will be back to try more dishes and give updates."}
{"text":"This place was recommended, so I thought I would go ahead and give it a try. I do like how it's at a food court right next to door a Korean or oriental grocery store. I ordered a spicy dish that was recommended, and realized that it was too much for one entire dish.  It was made with rice everything. Although the dish didn't come with kimchi, the cashier generously offered it to me anyhow.  One of the cooks suggested that I balance out my spicy dish with a vegetable that's pickled, I don't remember what type of vegetable it was, it was readily available on a table with sauces, and is yellow. It would have been nice if there were a few dishes on the plate, not just one. Their portions were huge!  They had several other options, like spam fried rice. And they did also have vegetarian options as well, like Chap Chae.    When we were there, there was hardly anyone else. It was between lunch and dinner, so that was not surprised. Thankfully, people started rolling in soon after we were eating.    I wouldn't mind coming back to explore some more. And give it a little bit more time and try other dishes.    Around the area was a bakery, another restaurant, an area where cosmetics and skin care products were sold, a table with water filter that included alkaline water. Most everything was in Korean writing and some English. I adored the wall photos and how it advertised Arizona's beauty."}
{"text":"Oh, Asiana Kitchen! I had high hopes for you. Location is perfect, right inside of Asiana Market. Price is right and service is very prompt. However, food quality needs little bit of improvement.    I ordered the bulgogi dolsot bibimbap. When this order came out, I thought we had received it by mistake. It shouldn't be called bibimbap because I was expecting lots of vegetables and this dish had bare minimum.  For those who are hard core meat eaters, I can see you will like this dish. It's mostly meat and rice. It was also greasy from all the meat. The rice portion was small in comparison to the meat as well. I could've done with half the meat. It was also on the sweet side. Next time I will try their regular bibimbap.  Hubby ordered the seafood soon tofu. They didn't ask for spice level, so it comes out on the milder side. The flavor was very bland, the broth lacked any depth. Recommend going across the street for this dish.   Overall, I know they just opened couple of weeks ago so I will try couple more times and update my review."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped here to eat after grocery shopping in the market. We ordered the tonkatsu plate and the Rappokki. The portions seemed really big but I'm not sure if it was the portions that were big or if the giant plates made it seem like the portions were big. The tonkatsu came with rice and a side of salad with miso soup. I didn't like that they drenched the tonkatsu sauce all over the pork because it made the meat all soggy. I also wasn't a fan of the tonkatsu sauce. It was a weird, tangy gravy and not your typical tonkatsu sauce. The rappokki was really sweet and we could taste a lot of the chili flakes that went into the dish. The flavors were just not as good as some other places that made it. Overall, it was ok but we won't order those dishes again. We'll be back to try some other dishes."}
