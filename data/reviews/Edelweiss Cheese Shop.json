{"text":"I was so excited to find this shop the last time we visited Madison. What a great selection of artisan cheeses! The prices are so reasonable compared to what we would pay in Chicago. Plus the service was really friendly and helpful. They didn't mind when we ordered a quarter pound of this and a quarter pound of that. We will definitely return each time we visit our relatives and friends."}
{"text":"What a nice place to visit! The habanero havarti was soooo good. The lady working was so sweet, she even let me attempt to charge my dying cellphone on her dock. Her husband makes some of the cheese there and it is delicious! Go support this little shop!"}
{"text":"Come hungry. They also have lunch!!  The place is cute.  Great for a quick stop.  Has wine, beer and well, cheese.  I was expecting a lot more choices but they did have a small variety and I ended up purchasing a dill havarti.  They did have samples of three different cheeses.

There is not a lot to talk about.  I was expecting Elehnbachs or the Mouse House type experience but it was not quite up to par.  If I had not been comparing it to those, I think it would have been fine.

There is parking in the back.  Take the walkway towards the front of the place.  I got a little confused but it does make sense."}
{"text":"Looking for a little Wisconsin focused shope with local meats, cheese, drinks, trinkets and more?  Edelweiss is your place!

Edelweiss closed down to the public for 2 hours last night while we had our annual winter gathering in their quaint, hospitable dining room.  They made wonderful meat and cheese trays that I would recommend for any occasion.  This is a great place to shop or get lunch.  I have had the rubin and grilled cheese and both are wonderful.  Looking for a good gift? Check this place out.  Edelweiss is great for all sorts of occasions."}
{"text":"Adorable little cheese shop! The lady was incredibly sweet and extremely accommodating. Not to mention the cheese was delicious! Definitely a must see in Verona!"}
