{"text":"I'll say this about the place. The beer was cold. OK - there's my something nice. 

I sat at an empty bar stool this past Saturday night (02/27) in this semi-crowded establishment. They had a band that night but the place wasn't packed by any means. I actually wanted to check out the band since finding live music near me with no cover is few and far between. As I sat down the bartender (short blonde hair - permanent sour look on her face) asked what I wanted. I ordered my beer and waited for five minutes or so as she walked past me back and forth a good three or four times. She finally realized she had yet to give me a beer (which was a domestic bottle - not too hard to grab out of the cooler, pop the top and hand it to me) and with hardly a care sat my beer on the bar. I ordered some food as well (she was just SO inviting with her lovely: \"You want food?\") which was decent enough. My issue was no silverware was provided (I had an app - not  a huge deal) but no napkins were provided. I would've asked for some but the bartender was too busy getting drinks for the regulars and laughing it up with them. I finished my food quickly and asked for the tab. I didn't want to spend another minute or dime there. It took roughly 10 minutes to get my tab (I had to ask the other bartender. Who seemed almost as disinterested as the other one). Tabbed out and practically ran out the door. I don't like giving 1 stars but this place warrants it. I may go back in hopes this was a bad night for the bartenders, but probably won't. My money spends anywhere. But it won't be at Zig's for a long time."}
{"text":"I use to come here alot before I had kids & it was busier, but lately it's not as exciting as it use to be.  They do have really good food.  You can bring family to eat, but it's not a kids friendly atmosphere & no high chairs."}
{"text":"First, I should point out that Zig's is not on Brookpark Road - but at the corner of Snow and Broadview in the strip plaza.

When you walk in, it looks like a full on bar complete with a big, dominant bar in the center of the room, a few tables around the outside and a stage area in the back, This is Parma and you're expecting a standard shot-and-beer joint. But I went in there around 2 PM on a Monday, so there were no revelers or professional drinkers or daytime drinkers killing time. There was, however, a much more extensive menu than you would have imagined. This is actually a pretty decent restaurant cleverly disguised as a standard Parma storefront bar, an excellent and surprising ruse.

Try any of the pizzas - the Bacon Chicken Ranch pizza we split was fantastic, an 12\" 8 slice pie that was still very, very good cold the next day. Seriously great eats. The service was good as should have been as they were only three people in the place; the pizza took a little longer than I thought it would, but I was in a bar so I wasn't expecting the incredibly good pizza that came so that was forgiven in a hurry. All in all, a nice surprise in a spontaneous lunchtime decison. And the price was very good, less than $15 for lunch including tip for two."}
{"text":"This place has moved, to Snow Road, .... and being out of town, when I looked them up to meet my family ....i went to the wrong location... lol.  Typical for me.  Sigh.

Anyways, they don't have a YELP with their updated address, but it is in that plaza on Snow and Broadview, behind Sonic, by some fitness place.

Its a nice little place, and I ordered a philly cheesesteak and it was pretty stinking good.. with strips of steak, not sliced thin.. yum.  Also steaks were like 2.99... on special.  And their Southwest salad looked amazing.   

Seems like a good hang out place, lots of little things to keep you entertained, but you can always just get some great conversations going."}
{"text":"I went there for a business lunch and the food came out quickly and delicious! Looks like a great place to watch a game...plenty of TVs! I shall return."}
{"text":"What do you get when you cross a beer & a shot joint with a dying strip mall? Zig's! We came here to watch a friend's band play. The spot is much bigger than it looks, but it wasn't ideal for music. Even though it's big, the  the band is way in the back, sitting behind a disused dance floor. There really ought to be some tables there. Taps were OK, with two Great Lakes options and a handful of macro standards. Service was decent at the busy bar. Didn't try the food, but it looked like bar staples. It's hard to imagine going out of my way to go here without a good reason."}
{"text":"We were expecting much worse since we drive by everyday. For a \"dive bar\" and the service we received I am giving this bar a 5. You could tell who the regulars are and they seemed alright and non creepy. The bartender working was very social and attentive. And the steak salad and wrap we ordered were great. They have hoeegarden on tap so that is an extra plus for me. :) I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Crazy in here. Bartender/waitress is busting her butt, but a smile would go a long way. Not very polite."}
{"text":"We decided to start going out to local bars for taco Tuesday's. Sat at a table off to the side. Service was quick. Drinks never ran dry. Tacos weren't bad. Nothing to write home about but not bad. Nice quiet, lil spot. I'd go out for a few drinks with the gals"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick shot and a beer before meeting up with some friends over at KUMO. Bartender had a great deal of entitlement, told us to not stack glasses, because she didn't want to keep getting fresh ones. which i guess is not that big of a deal. But she then asked us if we wanted more shots, and my friend and i both said \"No, Thank You.\" and completely disregarding us, she poured us two more shots, even though we explicitly said we did not want them, So the shots were on the house correct? NOPE! we got charged for them. Needless to say we got robbed and i refuse to give my money to a place that doesn't respect it. I will not be going back there."}
