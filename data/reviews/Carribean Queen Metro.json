{"text":"Food is reasonably cheap and tasty. Especially their spicy chicken and jerk chicken. Perfect when you want to grab something filling on the go for less than $10.

The staff there could benefit from being less overly stingy...the staff took almost 1 full minute picking a piece of chicken for me to sample (after she offered nonetheless) and would keep skewering pieces that were \"too large\" apparently, take it off the toothpick and try again. Even when filling the containers, the staff are very very careful to not put too much food, counting out exact pieces of chicken from the curries and even taking some out of the container after."}
{"text":"I've tried their other chicken flavours. But I'm hooked on their calypso chicken 

The service is nice and quick and just your typical fast food but the food is honestly amazing"}
{"text":"After reading good reviews here about their jerk chicken, I went there for a try, what a disappointment!  It tastes nothing like jerk chicken, more like Chinese food court style spicy black bean chicken.  If you want to try out authentic jerk chicken, go to Ritz Caribbean Foods at Yonge & College instead."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed the first time I tried their island fries. However, they seem less flavorful and tasty now. It could be a good thing, since the second time I dined there, the food gave me a sore throat, I felt it was MSG loaded. Anyway, the portions are usually very generous and choices are plenty. A couple weeks ago when I walked by, the staff offered me a student discount, with rice or noodle + 2 veg options + 1 meat = $7.90 after tax, quite a steal. Don't know if the promotion is still on, but they don't ask for IDs or anything, just wear a backpack and look the part!"}
{"text":"What happened?!? I thought I ordered jerk chicken with rice and peas.  Looked like jerk chicken but nope. Whomever cooked this dish does not know where the Caribbean is and has not ever eaten the food. My chicken tasted like hoisin sauce meets black pepper. No trace of jerk. This is Chinese food. Never ever again.  Oh yeah....the 2 stars is because the rice tasted ok but still not authentic."}
{"text":"They offer a 6.99 special where you can pick rice or noodle, two vegetables, and one meat.
Comes with quite a lot of food, but it's also quite greasy.

I ordered fried noodles with tofu and mixed vegetables, with jerk chicken.
The jerk chicken tasted very different from what I expected. The tofu was a bit hard. Noodles were alright.

Overall, you're getting a lot of average food for an average price."}
{"text":"As far as food court meals go, this was definitely one of my favourites.
The employees here are super friendly and give you really large portions! 

Knowing my indecisiveness nature, I'm always both excited and stressed when presented with an assortment of options to choose from. That's why when I came here to get the 1 meat, 1 vegetable plus rice/noodles meal set, you could see it caused a lot of internal debate. Thankfully, the employee let me try a few samples to help decide which meat to get and also allowed me to order \"half rice and half noodles\"! How accommodating! 

The food was pretty good - tender and saucy chicken, fresh vegetables, and the rice and noodles were both cooked to the right texture. The only thing I didn't like so much was that everything was pretty oily (surprise!). But I can forgive them for that since it IS foodcourt food after all and it's not like there was a puddle of oil at the bottom (which believe me, happens at a lot of other places). 

So my verdict? They gave me my grain, my protein, and my veggies (which tends to be the one that fast foods skimp out on) so yea sure, I would come here again!"}
{"text":"Located inside the Dundas Square AMC building 3rd floor food court.  There were escalators going up the stairs, but we couldn't find the down escalator so we took the elevator down.

The food is cheap, but so is the taste.  I got a Combo #1 (one meat + one vegetable) for $7.  The quantity is generous.  I got steamed rice with the pepper pot steak.  The sauce was a deep red color and the meat tasted ok.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  This restaurant very much resembles a fast food Chinese take out place.  I wonder if they misspelled \"Carribean\" on their receipt on purpose when it's supposed to be 2 b's instead of 2 r's.  The steamed rice was on the hard side and not that great.  They had jerk chicken and assorted other meat dishes.  I also tried the fried plantain, which was sweet but could be softer.  

The food court wasn't too busy and there were plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Located on the food court on the third floor of 10 Dundas St, it's one of my favorite place to eat downtown. I usually get their special for $6.99. Comes with rice or noodle, two vegetable and one meat portion. Their Island grill chicken, and Jerk chicken are delicious and they give good portions."}
{"text":"Very delicious and juicy chicken. The BEST! 
The jerk chicken is spicy hot and their island chicken is finger licking good. 
I have yet to find a place that makes the best jerk chicken in Toronto. Also, this is boneless, so it's much easier to eat and enjoy."}
{"text":"The food court at the Yonge/Dundas mall pales in comparison to the one in the Eaton Centre across the road, and it can certainly be a challenge finding something edible to eat (I'm looking in your direction, California Thai).

I decided to give Caribbean Queen a shot, given that I've had relatively good experiences at the other locations.

I ordered a plate containing three items: Chow Mein noodles, Calypso Chicken, and Mixed Vegetables. (I actually asked for the Green Beans instead of that last item, but I guess Green Beans sounds similar to Mixed Vegetables? I guess?)

My first bite was of the Calypso Chicken and I immediately bit into an inedible piece of cartilage. Not the best start to my meal.

The rest of the chicken was fine, thankfully. It's slathered in this sweet yet somewhat spicy sauce and it's about on the same level with similar offerings at Manchu Wok. The noodles were tasteless and a little too al dente, while the veggies were steamed and bland. Luckily I had the foresight to request a couple packets of hot sauce. That helped.

I should also mention that unlike ordering a similar platter at Manchu Wok, this came out to less than $8.00 with tax. At least if I'm going to eat mediocre food, I'm happy that I don't have to pay too much for it."}
{"text":"- I have tried EVERYTHING here lool and I love all their food. My favs are:
     + pepper pot steak: sooo tender and the sauce was so tasty
     + roasted potatoes: I think they have marinated them with soy sauce before baking, very flavourful
     + chicken in mango sauce: it's sweet and sour but I love them
     + I always eat them with white rice and mixed vegetables (broccoli and carrots)
- Portion: generous, for $7.90 after tax, you will get a huge amount of food enough for 1.5 meals
- Price: fair but of course not as cheap as those in chinatown 
- Customer service was fast and friendly
- Will I come back? yes I basically eat there every week hahaha"}
