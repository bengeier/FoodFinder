{"text":"I have been coming to Mr. Greenjeans since I was a kid and it was always one of my favourites. I love how it's always the same and yet different somehow. This could just be me but I've always felt this way, maybe that's because I only make it to Mr. Greenjeans once every 2 years but I love the atmosphere and every meal I've ever had there I've loved. Even the last 3 trips we've had amazing service so I can't complain. Food wise I usually stick to apps and sandwiches and I have yet to be let down. Honestly all the apps I have tried are amazing from the Spinach Dip to the Chicken Wings, it's all good. Also the Chicken Club Sandwich is amazing. I wish I found myself in the Eatons Centre more often just so I could visit Mr. Greenjeans more. I would definitely recommend Mr. Greenjeans to anyone."}
{"text":"Worst. experience. ever.  I've been in the business, so I know how things roll and tend to be more forgiving and a big tipper.  Went for lunch with my mom before she left town, so it was supposed to be a pleasant experience.  

Ordered our food and noticed that when we said we wouldn't be having any alcohol, the waitress's demeanor completely changed.  She brought our coffee and then our food.  And never returned.  

I saw her standing, chatting with other wait staff, but she never looked over, so I went over and nicely asked if we could get a refill.  She looked at me like I was a big pain in the ass and said, \"I'll be there in a minute\" and turned around and continued to chat.  

I've NEVER not tipped - even this woman - she got a penny.  In restaurant speak it means, \"I didn't forget your tip -  this is all your service was worth\".  It's considered an insult.

On the way out I told the manager what happened.  He never apologized or offered to comp anything.  He just said, \"Yeah, they're unionized.  Not much I can do\"

This happened a few years back, but I've never been back since - and reading the current reviews,  I don't think I ever will.  

Because it was such a horrible experience, I later stopped  at a cafe with a nice atmosphere to remove the stench before I went home. Had such an amazing experience, that I became a regular and still frequent the place.  

Mr. Greenjeans started out as a really cool restaurant/plant store, but it has strayed WAY off the garden path."}
{"text":"I will never ever return to Mr. Greenjeans ever again.  I had one of the worst experiences ever last year when I went with a group of 15 people.  We were given two servers, and the second server was downright horrible.  Half of our table was served and completed their dinner before we got ours.  It took us almost an hour to get server our dinner.  And the food really wasn't all that special.

Never again!"}
{"text":"The service here was not good. I ate here at lunch time on a weekday, so understandably it was busy but even the simplest things were ignored. For example my friend asked for ketchup and had to ask again, and by the time he got it the fries were just about finished. Took a long time for water to be refilled.

I ordered a vegetarian pizza and the server didn't point out to me that it is actually gluten free. When I tasted it I asked him why it tasted funny and when he told me it was gluten free I said there must be a mistake, I didn't order gluten free. \"It's printed clearly on the menu - vegetarian pizza gluten free\", was the reply I got. He got the menu and there in very small swirly letters above the pizza were the letters gf. I've waitressed before, it seems like good policy to point this out to a customer when ordering, especially when it isn't clear on the menu and when we were in a hurry to order and may have missed the (tiny) \"gf\" above the dish. He replaced the pizza which was nice but I do think it should be made clear to the customer when ordering that it is gluten free. As an aside, I never have a meal replaced because I don't like it or whatever, but gluten free is not something that is very palatable if you're not used to it.

The mushroom soup was awful, didn't touch it. My friends chicken sandwich was well below average and left unfinished. Overall an expensive lunch that left us unsatisfied."}
{"text":"\"OMG! Mr. Greenjeans! I used to come here all the time for burgers,\" said the S.O. I'd never heard of Mr. Greenjeans but we stopped in for lunch so that the S.O. could have some kind of Proustian moment with a bun-encased beef patty.

Looking around at the shabby-chic decor all in soothing celadon-green hues, it was hard to imagine my uber-macho mate spending his pre-teen days in a space better suited for a little girl's tea party. It's like Rachel Ashwell puked pistachio ice cream all over the chintz upholstery.

For our meal, the S.O. had his obligatory burger ($10) and I had the Tunawich ($13): seared sushi-grade tuna on baguette with crispy bacon, roasted tomato, avocado, and wasabi mayo. All burgers and sandwiches come with fries or salad. 

I have to say that for a mall restaurant, my Tunawich was surprisingly good. And was it ever honking; I had to take half of it home after I polished off the thick-cut fries. 

According to the S.O., the burger was solid but I think his tastes have become more sophisticated since his Greenjeans days. 

There are probably better dining options around the area but for a mean Tunawich and flashback value for some, Mr. Greenjeans is at the Eaton Centre (Mews Level 4)."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend to the Winter Fest last Saturday which was great. However; it was very cold, so when we decided to go for dinner we ended up at Mr. Greenjeans due to the weather and perhaps a little laziness. I was a little surprised how dead it was being a former \"hot spot\". The food was pretty good, I mean I would eat there again, and the wait staff was great! When we first showed up we ordered a beer and asked if they could put on the leaf game. The were experiencing technical difficulties, but within a few minutes it was fixed and the game was on their big screen. If you find yourself there and you are the driver, you may want to stay away from their large draft, it is quite big, but do try their Buffalo Chips."}
{"text":"Great place to stop when your at the Eaton's  center 

Love everything on the menu

Staff is great

Prices are ok

And I like how its kind of off the beaten path on an upper level that has almost nothing ells sharing it 

Its very bright and cleanly decorated 

So don't hesitate take the escalator ride to this hidden gem"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good.  I had the steak sandwich and surprisingly it wasn't sliced beef.  It was actually a moderately thin steak that was very tender and flavorful.  It was a good size meal and the sweet potato fries were ok, they could have been a little crisper.

The food was good but the service was only ok.  The waiter was sort of slow and it wasn't the height of meal time."}
{"text":"My restaurant experience was okay. It wasn't the best food I've ever had, but definitely not the worst. I think if the restaurant had more vegetarian options it appeal to someone like me. I ordered a mushroom soup and bruschetta. My soup was incredibly salty, while my bruschetta was a bit on the oily side. I went there with two other friends (non-vegetarians), who enjoyed their food. However, this restaurant has failed to impress me."}
{"text":"Mediocre is the right word for the food.  I had lunch -- squash soup and bacon/onion quiche.  Quiche was soggy and salty, soup tasted like onion and curry, with very little squash taste.  It was also quite 'chunky' -- not my idea of how pureed should be like.  On the bright side, it was an oasis of calm from the shopping crowd.  Service was also decent.  Go for the atmosphere and expect mediocre food quality."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is nice. I sat on the bar side of the restaurant. Its got a cool vibe. 
I wasn't wowed by the food but it was pretty good. I had a burger and fries. The presentation was pretty awesome. It was on what looked like a small baking sheet and the fries were in a cup. That was pretty cool. 
My waiter was nice. Somewhat forgetful but nice none the less.
Will I go back? I'm not sure. If I'm in the Eaton Centre I'm usually not looking for a sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"Very pleased... Had the spinach dip starter and pesto chicken salad which was two huge pieces of chicken with a little bit of salad on it lol, can't complain!"}
{"text":"Sautéed Cajun Shrimp Caliente wasn't so caliente.  Shrimp was frío, literally.  That's all I have to say."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends on a weekday at around 3, a Wednesday. The space itself is very nice, nice layout, decor, colours and nice windows to sit by. That is where it earns the two stars. The fish cakes were small dry and bland. The apple tartar sauce that accompanied them was bland. The side salad was fine. Sweet potatoe fries were limp and the chipotle sauce was bland. The pulled pork and which was small, tasted vaguely of butter chicken, was overpriced and was overall just bad. Pork was dry and not tasty though it all looked good. The portion of cole slaw on the side was vaguely insulting, amounting to two tablespoons of warmer than room temperature bad slaw. 

Service was painfully slow, and at one point the server asked if we wanted our water refilled and then disappeared for 5 minutes before wandering by and realizing he hadn't gotten water.  Really a mess. And the menus are an eyesore full of bland sounding overpriced lunch options I don't think tourists deserve to fooled into thinking will be good."}
{"text":"I've been to Mr. Greenjeans only a handful of times, yet have only been inspired to write a review at this moment. I have to give props to the venue. It ain't easy to turn a mall restaurant into the pretty place Mr. Greenjeans is today. When friends told they were at the back, they were waaaaaaay at the back and we had a lovely view of a courtyard

But the food fell flat. Today, I ordered the fish tacos that would have been ok if not for the salsa which was way off, past it's serve-by date. The flavor of it seeped into the rest of the taco which was really, really unfortunate. I had to scrape the salsa off which meant taking the black beans and mango with it. Great. Shredded lettuce and fried fish on a cold tortilla! Mr. Greenjeans, a tortilla is not a taco. Shouldn't have to tell you that. The Cesar salad on the side was nothing special as well with it's floppy lettuce. The croutons (usually my favorite) were hard and uber-stale. 

The service has always been decent, water filled at all times and paying goes by fast. But that taco should not have left the kitchen. And because of this, I will not be entering this restaurant any time soon..."}
{"text":"Having heard the news that Mr. Greenjeans will be going out of business after 34 years of operation, allow me to wax poetic for a moment about my memories and experience eating there.

One of my first memories as a child was going there as a child in 1996 with my family. It seemed like such a different time (and restaurant) then - I remember being totally enamored by this strange green restaurant in the middle of the Eaton Centre, and really liking the design of the place.

I ended up going back there a year ago (as of this writing) with a friend to try it out, and being struck by how much the decor and ambience of the restaurant felt exactly the same as it did when I first went 17 years ago. It was like walking into a period piece - there was this bizarre subdued attitude throughout the restaurant - strange, considering we went during peak dinner hour on a Saturday - the windows looked like they hadn't been cleaned in years, and the whole place just felt dark and drab.

I wasn't really impressed by the food when I went - I ordered a burger and was surprised by two things: how expensive everything in the menu seemed, and how bland the food tasted. It brings to mind a Gordon Ramsay-esque saying, \"Offer Toronto diner food at Toronto prices.\" Everything just felt arbitrarily expensive when it wasn't justified, and given some of the other reviews here, I'm not exactly surprised that the quality of the food was so low.

Greenjeans lasted a lot longer than I thought it would. One of the reviews on the Yelp page had it right - if it was located anywhere else besides the Eaton Centre, it would have closed up shop many years ago. It just seemed to exist as a relic of an earlier time. Not that it didn't have any value, but it never seemed to make any effort to modernize itself or take advantage of that perception.

Still, I'll always have fond memories of that first time I went all those years ago. That's about all I can ask for."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this place. I didn't go in with high expectations since it's a mall restaurant. My date and I were in the mood for some salads...the Cobb was great, and the quinoa shrimp salad was very different. Had my first Cesar here it did not disappoint"}
{"text":"I live and work downtown, and as such I tend to frequent Mr. Green Jeans on a regular basis. I usually only come for drinks, which I find are quite reasonably priced. They have daily drink specials as well. On the weekends you can have one of their delicious caesars for only $5. What makes this caesar so special is the amazing garnish - slice of cucumber, olive, gherkin and best of all, a slice of roasted pepperoni! YUM. I am only giving it 3 stars as once I ate a jerk chicken sandwich here and the chicken was cold. I could tell they just took it out of the fridge and threw it on the bun. I think you should always have a freshly cooked chicken breast when you are paying $12 for a sandwich, but that's just me. I have also had nachos here which were tasty."}
{"text":"Avoid this spot if possible. 

They're menu is large and uninspired ... it's like they're trying to please such a wide-array of guests (tourists), that they tend to fall flat on flavour.

They're atmosphere is very dated and confusing. Their dining room is all white with pillars and chandeliers, while their bar area looks like you're walking into the Secret Garden.

But they're LLBO licensed in the Eaton Centre, so that earns two stars (I like booze)."}
{"text":"Mr. Greenjeans, i'll give you a +0.5 for your Monday half price wines (by the bottle) deal. for letting us get our wine buzz on on a weekday afternoon (Family Day holiday) and only setting us back $10!"}
{"text":"Randomly decided to go there with a friend once since we both wanted to try something new. The decor was nice and pleasant, not something one would expect with a green & white color combination. The service was fast and friendly, I had no issues there

So anyways, she got the club sandwich and I got the mushroom-swiss burger. It was good, but not heavenly like I had expected (I have this thing for trying the mushroom-swiss wherever I go) for the price.

But I would recommend this place, the plate was filling and overall it's a nice place to go for lunch"}
{"text":"Basic pub food, basic beer list, nice bartender. Okay for a quick pint if you are in the the Eaton Centre, but would not actively seek it out."}
{"text":"To escape the humble beginnings of a torrential downpour on Sunday, my brother and I decided to stay inside the mall and have dinner at Mr. Greenjeans. I was pretty skeptical at first, and I wasn't about to succumb to the trap that is the packed food court, so I settled.

It was pretty quiet on the day that we came in. We were seated on the lounge side of the restaurant. It was nice, well lit, and equipped with extremely large tables. Our server came by promptly and took our drink orders. She also diligently checked up on my brother and I and made sure that all of the food was to our liking. 

We started out with the calamari ($10). The marinara sauce was good, but the calamari was a bit on the oily side. Not a huge deal, but it was just too oily for my liking. Then, I decided to channel my inner 5 year old and get the chicken fingers and buffalo chips ($14). The buffalo chips are basically kettle chips. I love kettle chips so I really liked these. The chicken fingers were awesome. They were pretty large and you get 5 of them. I can eat a lot and I could hardly finish my meal with these chicken fingers. They're also super juicy and tender. My brother had the Squiggly burger which was a 7oz. pork and chorizo burger with bacon ($14). It looked really good and he said it was quite tasty as well. He also couldn't finish his meal. 

Our server made sure to check up on us as soon as we were done and we had our bill in no time. She was extremely sweet and super speedy. For my brother and I, we paid less than $60 including the tip and we had a pretty good time at Mr. Greenjeans. I just might be back if I'm even in the mall again."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like Mr Greenjeans. I've walked past it for years! 

But the outside didn't match the inside. What I found was an overly bright interior that had a slight cafeteria feel to it (empty coat hangers next to our table, plastic bins for dishes left out in the open). 

The restaurant was nearly empty, yet the server placed us at a table with a cold draft. 

They made up for it by being very nice. Let me stress that the service was really great and very attentive. It just couldn't save the very lackluster food. It felt cheap and hurried and was overpriced."}
{"text":"I got the chicken fetticuini pasta, it was absolutely disgusting. It was slimey and tasted like snails or something! There was a main ingredient missing from the sauce... I'm not a chef or anything but I could tell. 
There was also tomatoes, spinach, and chicken in the pasta. The spinach made the slimey texture even worse. And the chicken was burnt. 
And it was $16! 
It was like my favourite restaurant for a while, but after that experience I will never return again."}
{"text":"I have work close to this joint for almost 10 years. I only been here twice. Should I continue? lol

Bottom line there is way better food around this area even if you want burger. 

I must say the service is not bad. Then again I am a cheap bastard I prefer good food over service :-)"}
{"text":"Meh.. This place was a let down for me. I came here with my family and was excited about trying something new. The menu looked promising and I was excited to try the N.Y strip loin.. It was alright- I wish there was more flavour in there and I was not a fan of those buffalo chips. I had tried my grandpas jerk chicken sandwich- that chicken was good although I had wish there would have been more kick! However, I'm a true spice lover! 
The decor was a little blah for me but the service was great! Very attentive when refills are needed and the food did not take that long either.
I would come back but only if someone was set on coming here... Thankfully that won't happen!"}
{"text":"It sure beats eating in the food court at the Eaton Centre.  Mr Greenjeans is your typical grill food. Salads, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, wings. This place has everything packed into one.  Their buffalo chips are pretty tasty. It's Mr Greenjeans version of french fries. 

There are odd choices on the menu, such as Pad Thai. Though I never ordered such a thing, I don't think I'd recommend that.  Highly recommend the buffalo chips and the bruschetta is pretty decent. 

Nice ambiance, relaxing setting, and relatively large restaurant."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I wasn't expecting a lot when my nephew suggested eating here. Somehow I was still disappointed.

The service was pretty sad, making it a bit challenging to get refills on our drinks or water. Our server also seemed to question my nephew's order, based on the fact that she thought it was too 'adult' for him.

What he ordered was a salmon pasta dish, and the thing he didn't really like about was the fact the salmon was dry and over-cooked. I had the crispy chicken salad and the chicken was also over-cooked and the salad itself was really overdressed.

Not a great experience overall- maybe next time I'll just get a milkshake. They looked great."}
{"text":"After hitting up a number of shops in the Eaton Centre this afternoon, my friend and I were starving and decided to pop into Mr. Greenjeans for a very late lunch/early dinner.  

Ok, so we were seated very quickly, which was nice, but the place was LOUD.  After walking around the mall for a couple of hours, all we wanted was some quick, healthy food in a relaxing environment.  Thus, choosing this spot was a bit of a fail in the healthy and relaxing department.  

Not that there weren't any healthy options, but healthy don't come cheap at this place.  Anything healthy was easily $20+, not what you'd expect to pay when eating at a restaurant in a mall.  The menu consists of your basics: pasta, burgers, pizzas, and the usual starters like deep fried calamari and nachos...you know the drill.  

Anyway, we were both famished and after humming and hawing over whether or not to stay, we stayed, ordered a couple of burgers at about $12-$14 with salad ($1.75 extra).  I had the Mr. Perfection burger, it was ok, but nothing special.  My friend had the lamb burger and she seemed to love it.

So on the plus side, we were seated quickly, our server was friendly and the place is nicely decorated, the chandeliers are a nice touch...on the 'meh' side, the food was kinda pricey and average at best - imho.

There are better places nearby."}
{"text":"Just arrived after lunch, not very busy - yet didn't get any service after being sat down. Left after 10 mins without any of the staff inquiring why. Poor service wont get my service."}
{"text":"I went here in May 2010 with someone.  I ordered the fish and chips and a milkshake, she ordered a salad.  She took one bite of her salad, looked at me, and said 'this tastes like sand.'  I thought she was out of her mind until I tasted it.  Lo, she was right!  Mr. Greenjeans figured out how to make a salad taste like sand!

The waiter delivered my chocolate milkshake and boasted that it was the best milkshake in the city.  It wasn't the worst milkshake I've had, but it did taste like a powder mix.  My fish and chips weren't that great, either, and, frankly, left me feeling a tad ill.

All that combined with a hefty cheque in which they list the 'recommended' tips, beginning around 20%.  I gave them 10% and still felt cheated."}
{"text":"First time there, got drunk. The lovely lighting was lit low. Service wasn't too attentive, but they do have Sriracha hot sauce.  The vibe I got from the bar was like a nice place in Alabama. I can't decide on weather I'd go back because I didn't pay attention to the menu. The buffalo chips didn't taste like buffalo. Dude, water is upon request, and nothing is complimentary."}
{"text":"Four of us had lunch here the other day.  We had a pleasant experience.  It's nice to be able to sit and enjoy a meal away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the mall.  The decor is nice, shabby chic meets crystal chandeliers, it's a but rustic for what I like, but still nice.

On to the food.  I ordered a southern fried chicken sandwich with a caesar salad.  It arrived and was totally massive, I pretty much just ate the chicken and salad and left the bun alone.  It was huge.  The Vegetarian looked really good, my DC had that, no complaints, another popular choice was their BLT.

They had a really good edited menu."}
{"text":"My last day in Toronto, I went to the Eaton Centre and spotted this restaurant in the mall. Out of curiousity, I decided to try it.

The second I walked into this restaurant, I was AMAZED by the decor of this place. To the right is the restaurant and to the left is the bar section. Overall, this is probably one of the prettiest, most soothing restaurant ever in terms of the decoration.

SERVICE (5 stars): Our food arrived very fast and the service was great. He came at the right times to place our orders and tno give us our bill. 

STAFF (5): We asked to be seated outside because it was memorial day and it was really nice out. However, once we got outside, we started sweating and asked instead to be seated instead. The staff was very accomodating and very nice about it.

APPETIZER (5): I ordered their mushroom chowder. The mushroom chowder is delicious. There is a STRONG mushroom taste so if you don't liike mushrooms, this is definitely not for you. The portion was prefect for 2 for a small appetizer. 

ENTREE(4) : I ordered the seafood pasta and my boyfriend ordered their fish taco. I was very happy with my seafood pasta. The pasta was a homemade hand-rolled pasta that was very filling and there was an abundance of seafood on the plate (squid, scallops, fish, clams, and mussles). The sauce of the seafood was light but very tasteful. My boyfriend's fish taco was huge and he was able to finish it even having a late breakfast. 

OVERALL (5)  We both really enjoyed our meal, the beautiful decoration, and the friendly staff. This is a place I highly recommend if you want to eat around the Yonge/Dundas area!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry.  Had to give this place a two.
I've enjoyed it in the past but I have found that the quality in food has dropped.  I had the tuna sandwich (seared tuna). It actually had a fridge/stored flavour.  The towels smelled of damp laundry.  Maybe my senses were extra powerful today but the quality of care appears to have dropped.  Even visually, the sandwich did not look like an $18 seared tuna sandwich should look like.  The bread did not feel or taste fresh.  The item could just as well have been prepackaged and purchased at a local grocery store.  The Stella Artois pint glasses was chipped, as was my dining companion.  I would have overlooked it, but given the overall quality of the experience, thought it deserved a mention."}
{"text":"This restaurant probably only has meaning and relevance to people who still understand who Mr. Greenjeans actually was. 

If this restaurant was any place other than Eaton Center, one of the few sit down restaurants in the Eaton Center, it would have closed up shop decades ago.

The best I can say is it's got a varied menu. There's sure to be some item on the menu guaranteed to disappoint the diner no matter what kind of cuisine the diner is prepared to have his hopes dashed by.

I had wisely eaten at Wendy's a few hours before going here with my family so I only had the dahl and naan starter. Price wise it was okay. Portion size was decent. The dahl was a thin gruel and the naan was indistinguishable from pita bread.

My sister had the lobster grilled cheese. The waitress did fess up it was from a can. No surprise for the price.

My nephew and his oddly named GF both had the southern fried chicken sandwich and seemed to have no complaints. It looked like the best meal on the table.

The waitress was sub par. A request for water refills resulted in the glass of the person making the request refilled, not the other people at the table with likewise empty glasses. No offer to freshen my coffee was offered. The waitress was notably absent for most of the meal. And she brought out my 10 year old niece's kid's meal last. Never let a kid have to cool his/her heals at the table while everyone else has food.

The natural lighting of the place and the faint Mediterranean decor does at least buy a small bit of peace and respite from the craziness of the mall on Saturday."}
{"text":"mediocre mediocre mediocre

I got the Swiss burger and a Pepsi, it came to $18

it was not worth $18.

it wasn't bad per say, but just about every other place I've ever been to did a better or same quality burger, most of them for less than$10 and the rest of the food's quality is similar from what my party said.

Other than that the place is boring and doesn't have any individual character (like most downtown stores I guess) just go to a real restaurant, one with good, reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"Mr. Greenjeans is apparently a mainstay in Toronto to those that grew up here and spent their youth bumming around the Eaton Centre (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/toronto-eaton-centre-toronto), looking for a place to hang out and grab a bite to eat.  There's apparently a rich tapestry of memories that come with Mr. Greenjeans for those that were here to enjoy the ups and downs that the place has gone through.  Sadly, I didn't grow up in Toronto and have no such reference.  As such, the place is a decent enough place to hit after work or for a quick bite at lunch.

Nothing is really brilliant or disastrous with Mr. Greenjeans.  The décor is quite decent, the bar has a good run of taps and drinks available, the food variations and lunch specials are good enough and quite affordable.  Nothing really wrong.  But nothing truly dazzles in a \"you have to eat here!\" sort of thing.  Instead it seems to be the lesser of many evils in the Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"We visited Mr Greenjeans on Sunday August 3. 2014 at 12:00 PM. The hostess was not friendly, the waiter was grumpy. The food was satisfactory but nothing special. When we walked out. the hostess did not pay attention to us. The overall experience in this restaurant was unacceptable. I am not sure who is managing this restaurant, but they better get their staff basic customer service training.  I get better service down by the food court. Not worth the money or time."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I think it's great! It has typical, but above average grill food, and it's in a slightly classier atmosphere. The sunroof and chandeliers make it a pleasant place to eat, especially on a nice summer day.

On my last visit I had the mushroom burger and fries, while my girlfriend had the club sandwich, and both were delicious. For burgers, it was easily one of the best I've ever had. I've also heard recommendations for the buffalo chips and the milkshakes (which looked delicious, but I was too stuffed!)"}
{"text":"I've given Greenjeans a few tries, which is generous because I've had one of my worst dining experience at this place. The last straw was taking visitors to TO there, getting seated, and the waiting 20 minutes for someone to take our order. After flagging down an employee and asking if he could find our waitress,  \"Maybe\" was his reply. 

No maybe about it. We walked right out of there.  I recommend you go to City Grill directly underneath it instead."}
{"text":"Great service, pretty good but greasy fried unhealthy food.."}
{"text":"Good food.  Friendly staff.  Very nice decor.  Great place to enjoy a family meal."}
{"text":"Mmm artichoke and spinach dip..sooo good!  These guys have a great, friendly, neighborhood vibe.  Everyones really nice and helpful and Mallory behind the bar is attentive and full of smiles.  She got me addicted to an exquisite Zinfandel that tickles the tongue and pleases the palate (yes, i like my zinfandel...shhhh!)  I just stopped in on my way to go book shopping and i definitely will return.  Prices are great.  They put ur stuff behind the bar when u go for a smoke (big plus!), and service was prompt, polite and super duper awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Mr. Greenjeans for well over a decade, and I still remember it when with a meal, each person got a token for the vending machines out front at which you could win free drinks, meals, etc. It was really kitchy back then. When I started at Ryerson (years ago) and I went back, I saw that they'd renovated it and then again in the past few years they've made more changes.

It's got a very modern, fresh, clean look to it and it really goes well with the \"new\" menu they've introduced.

The food: I have yet to have a bad experience with this menu. Given, as another person mentioned, the fish taco left something to be desired, but really... it's not a taco place, not a mexican place... so my expectations weren't high to begin with. The salsa on mine was borderline past its date (something in it had gone that unappetizing wilty brown-green color) but overall it was okay. The sweet potato fries are always crispy and they come with a to die for sauce and the buffalo chips usually steal my attention away from the main for quite some time. My usual fare is \"The Vegetarian\", which is a lightly breaded and fried piece of eggplant with arugula, lemon aioli, brie cheese and some other super yum stuff. You cannot go wrong with this sandwich!

My friend has tried their steak sandwich, the grilled chicken sandwich, the chicken pasta tomatoey kind of dish and none of it has disappointed. It's our new place to go whenever we hang out. Cheesecake is good too but that's kind of hard to screw up.

Oh and the milkshakes? KILLER. Try the cherry one, you won't want to eat the rest of your dinner it's so good.

Another perk, you can join their loyalty club for free.. just show the card whenever you go and you accumulate dollar credits to go against future bills or something. It's free, why not?"}
{"text":"Over the last few years, this restaurant has really stepped up its game.  I have rarely have a bad experience and the food is consistently good.  The service is usually good. 

My favourites are:

1.  the Jerk style chicken breast salad (I like the spices on the chicken - it has quite a kick) and the dressing but the rest is just romaine lettuce (somewhat uninspired).  

2.  Grilled salmon with mango salsa and grilled veggies and potatoes.  I like that they include sweet potatoes in the mix.  Served on a ceder plank.  

3.  My new favourite is the vegetarian sandwich - eggplant, red pepper puree, lemon aioli and brie served on a chiabatta bun.  I had the Cesar salad with it on the side.  It was ok but the sandwich was very good.  It was quite filling.  

I love their bloody ceasars too.  The drink is huge and is served with a skewer of assorted veggies and a piece of sausage.  I know it sounds weird but it is quite good...and filling.  

Keep up the good work Mr. Greenjeans.  There are not that many restaurants out there that have been around as long as you have.  I have been a customer for approximately 30 years."}
{"text":"I originally wrote this review and posted it onto other websites in 2010, but this was one of the absolute worst restaurant experiences I have ever had and thought I should repost it onto yelp: the menu it stated to inform the waiter of any allergies, so my friend informed him that she was unable to eat any foods containing gluten, as she has Celiac's disease. Upon hearing this, the waiter immediately looked frustrated, and almost angry at her. His voice was elevated and he quite loudly and rashly stated that she \"could eat nothing here, then.\" His tone implied that it was her fault for her dietary restrictions and he seemed not at all impressed. Rudely, he then began listing off foods that she could eat, contradicting what he said earlier about there being nothing on the menu for her. After he was done irritably listing off gluten-free items, my friend finally decided upon a simple, well-done steak with French fries. The waiter then turned to me, and I politely asked for the chicken penne pasta dish, but without mushrooms. He then raised his voice to me, saying, \"we do not make substitutions or changes to the menu, but I'll see what I can do\". Then he walked away. I understand if restaurants want to preserve the integrity of their menu and not change it around, but I did not see anything on the menu stating that I could not add or remove ingredients that I do not like. I would have been fine if he apologized and said that they were unable make this accommodation and I would have ordered something else, but he seemed incredibly hostile and he walked away so quickly that I could not offer an alternative selection if the mushrooms were not able to be removed. It took about 45 minutes to an hour until our food finally arrived. We had the pleasure of watching the people around us, who had walked in 15-20 minutes after we had, being served long before us, and one lady who came in about 20 minutes after we had was given her entire meal and had paid for her food before our food even arrived. When it did arrive, we were starved and just really wanted to eat a decent meal. My friend cut in to her steak and it was completely red and bloody still in the centre; not at all well-done as she had ordered. It looked like it had not been cooked at all, and for the near hour that they had to cook it, it was totally unacceptable. My pasta, as well was disgusting. The chicken was obviously the pre-cooked strips of chicken you can get on sale at the grocery store. The pancetta was not pancetta at all; it was ready-cook bacon that tasted like plastic. And to top it all off, there was a large quantity of things that quite resembled mushrooms throughout the dish. Angrily, I removed all of the 'mushrooms' to the side of the plate. When the waiter finally returned, my friend told him that her steak was pink in the centre and he responded with an \"oh, okay\", and he took the plate away. After about 10 minutes, the manager came out to our table and apologized for the steak; however, she made up a strange excuse with her apology. You see, apparently the lighting in the dining room is different from the lighting in the kitchen, so the chefs cannot tell if the steak is fully cooked or not. I don't know what planet they thought we were from, but that makes absolutely no sense at all! I'm sure people have ordered steaks from there before, and if they are just now discovering that their kitchen lighting makes their steaks look finished when they are not, then there is a serious problem there. My friend told her that it was not just the light, that it also tasted rare, and the manager took the steak off the bill. She then left me with the rest of the bill to pay. We wanted it to be on separate bills, but instead she just left the one on the table so I paid for my friend's drink as well. When our waiter came back to take my plate away, he abrasively said, \"Those aren't mushrooms, you know. Those are eggplants.\" I had not even said any complaint about the 'mushroom/eggplant', I had just moved them to the side, and certainly did not appreciate being yelled at for the fact that I did not eat them. My friend had tried eating one and said that it tasted a lot more like mushrooms than eggplant. I am not stupid, and I know what eggplant looks like. It is white inside. Mushrooms are brown and spongy. These were likely not eggplants. As the old saying goes, if it looks like a mushroom and it tastes like a mushroom, then it probably is a mushroom. Nevertheless, I was sick of arguing and just handed him my card to pay without saying anything back. Later, I came home and checked the menu again, because I did not remember it saying anything about having eggplant in the dish. (I am not a huge fan of eggplant either, and I knew I would not have ordered something that had both eggplants and mushrooms in it... I simply would have picked something else on the menu)."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere, nothing fancy.  The service was fair, from what I remember.  But there are soo many other restaurants in Toronto and even in this area that are better, why come here?  

I know some people who used to come here to eat all the time in University.  But for me, this I would only eat here if I was super hungry and just had to eat somewhere quick.  The location is good, obviously since it's right by Dundas Square.  

I would recommend this place for lunch.

{"text":"Mr. Greenjeans is kind of a Toronto tradition. My mom tells me it was a big hangout back in the day when Sam the Record Man was actually a store, and people would go in to get their Chum Charts (I only know what those are because she has told me). 

That said, nowadays, they're kind of lacking. I mean, the food is OK. Just OK. For being boring, average food, it's a little pricey. I get it, they're in the Eaton Centre, but if they're going to charge more for their food, it should taste amazing. I can't say anything on the menu stands out as being phenomenal -- I've had wraps, salads, burgers and wings, and the only thing I really liked was the roasted veggie wrap, and a burger.

Other than the food, the decor has gotten a little strange. The interior used to be kitschy and fun, now they've tried to up the class by making everything white and mint green. Yuck. Can't say I enjoy hospital colours in a restaurant.

Basically, this place stays in business because people are lazy and want to stay in the mall to eat. And City Grill downstairs, is more expensive and less kid-friendly. If you need somewhere to eat and you can't be bothered to search, Mr. Greenjeans is alright, just don't expect the food to change your life."}
{"text":"We decided to patronize this eatery last Wednesday night for dinner.  We were seated right away and served by a very patient and friendly server who knew details about the menu selections. Our food arrived amazingly fast and it was pretty good. We had the bacon pizza, potato leek soup and carrot cake. All in all it was a decent meal. The place is decorated in a light, open-concept french-country style and it has a fair-sized balcony. The washrooms are on the upper level and there is a group seating area there as well. This restaurant is a good option after a day of shopping if you prefer something other than food court fare."}
{"text":"Conveniently located, but very mediocre. Food is overpriced, and beer is extremely expensive. Entrées come with buffalo chips as sides; 'upgrading' to fries is an additional cost. Décor is quite nice, but doesn't compensate for underwhelming food."}
{"text":"This is a really cute and kitschy resto with worn hardwood floors, exposed brick walls, wooden shutters, marble tables, leather chairs, and crystal chandliers. It has a calm and cool ambiance with lots of sage and creams running through out the decor.

This restaurant is located on the 4th floor of the Eaton centre and has two sides, the dining room or the lounge. I chose to sit on the lounge side, it seemed more relaxed and has the bar and tvs on that side so you can watch the game while you dine.

Our waitress was really nice and started off by taking our drink orders. I asked if they had lemonade since its my favourite bevarage and she was like of course we have a Pink Lemonade, so I was sold on that. They also have a really good cocktail menu as well!

They have a lot of variety on the menu with everything from sandwiches, burgers, pizza, pastas, gluten free options and ethnic foods.

We decided to split two mains because everything looked soo good.

I had to try one of there thin crust wood-fired pizza as soon as I saw it on the menu. I opted for the:

Bacon 'n Cheese Pizza - Topped with European double smoked bacon, roasted peppers & onions with a roasted garlic/basil/tomato base, topped with a blend of shredded mozzarella & Asiago cheese.
This was super delicious! Crust cooked perfectly and flavourful with crispy edges. There was ample toppings and I loved the combination of flavours. They put whole strips of crispy smoky bacon and sweet caramelized onions. Yum!

The Second main was:

Lamb Burger - with feta, tomatoes and onions in a grilled pita
with tzatziki. Cooked perfectly medium-well, very juicy, thick, and flavourful patty. Lots of feta and the tzatziki tasted really fresh and flavourful. No complaints on this main either!

The Lamb Burger came with a side of Buffalo chips. I don't know why they call it Buffalo chips because tit was not Buffalo flavoured however they tasted awesome! Very thin but crispy they were golden and light tasting. They came unsalted so you can just add salt to your liking.

Finally for Dessert:

Colossal Carrot Cake - Two layers of moist spicy carrot cake with
crushed pineapple, walnuts & coconut, covered with cream cheese
icing. Toasted almonds skirt the side. The icing was really creamy and delicious, the cake super moist, and flavourful. All and all A pretty great carrot cake!

Service was great! I ordered a tea with my dessert and told the waitress I thought the water wasnt hot enough, she apologized and promptly brought me a completely new tea pot with freshly boiled hot water without any hestitation.

They presentation of the meals were really outstanding, decor gourgous, great ambiance, top notch service, and a great menu and cocktail list. Its a definite must try to kick back and nosh after a day of shopping in the Eaton Centre."}
