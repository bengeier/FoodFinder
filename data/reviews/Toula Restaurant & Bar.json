{"text":"Surprisingly, Toula did not disappoint on the first day of Summerlicious. I got the avocado and crab tower and the lobster pasta that was delicious. The piece of lobster was ridiculously small though. Service was great as well. The place could do with a major renovation, and the bathrooms were down a few stairs which wouldn't be too great for anyone with mobility issues. They included 18% gratuity so keep that in mind if you're coming for the summerlicious menu."}
{"text":"Worse $30 meal ever!  Went there as a group of 6 for Winterlicious lunch.  Unfriendly staff but if the food was decent we would have overlooked the bad service.  Ordered seafood soup which had drips of liquid and leftover salmon chunks, defrosted calamari, and overboiled pasta.  One spoonful of this fishy soup concoction I stopped eating.  Ordered chicken thighs which on the entire plate had 2 thumb-sized chicken chunks too dry to cut with knife and absolutely no flavour.  One bite of this I stopped eating.  Dessert was the only thing I ate which was a small square of tiramisu which was probably purchased from a bakery.  Non-stop complaints from tables near us but manager didn't care and gave us bills with 18% gratuity included.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY/TIME going to this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"The location was good. Unfortunately when I entered to this restaurant I expected the best service and food.  The girls in the reception was not well dressed and unfortunately they was not welcome. Maybe they were not well trained for this position.  One main waiter and 2 more waiters serves us. My feeling was not good,  they were just looking for the tip.  The starter was in the average level when I compared to the other hight level restaurants. I ordered Steak for Main course. The potion was big enough but the sides not good and not designed.  Desert was good. This was the best part of dinner. The biggest weak point was the parking. There was no parking for that big hotel. You can not believe no valet parking for the downtown hotel. That was first and last time for taulo Restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here for winterlicious dinner and it was a HORRIBLE experience to say the least.  We made a reservation, however that seemed pointless considering they still made us wait 45 minutes to be seated.  Starving by the time we were seated, we already new exactly what we wanted to eat.  However, it took our waited 30 mins after being seated just to get a glass of water.  After we ordered, it took another 45 mins to get our bite sized appetizer.  Then another HOUR until we got our main.  By the time we left, we had been there for 4 hours.  It seemed as if none of their staff had worked at a restaurant before.  The portions were so small and the wait was so long that we left here still starving and picked up food on the way home.  I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I went to Toula today with a few friends for summerlicious. Very disappointing experience overall, and I would suggest to spend your money somewhere else.  + The view. Simply amazing  - The food: our menu was $20 (summerlicious deal) which was a great suprise. However, the food was below average, no one really enjoyed their meal. I had some fresh, hand made pasta, which was anything but fresh. Dessert (Tiramisu) was tasteless.   - The rip-off: I was drinking sparkling water, when a server tried to pour still water into my glass. I declined politely, but I was then asked why I did not want to drink... I took the time to explain that I was having sparkling. He came back with a bottle of sparkling water, poured some and apologized for his mistake. I thought he was trying to make up for his error. Instead I realized later that they actually charged me for a second bottle. - The decor. Completely outdated, needs a serious refresh. It really does not look clean.  - The staff: very dirty clothes, to a point where it cut my appetite. One of the servers reached out to my bottle of water and his sleeve touched my food. I would not bother in most cases, but his suit probably had not been cleaned for weeks. Gross...  Overall, a pretty bad experience, and I will not return to this place, even during summer/winterlicious. Not worth  it."}
{"text":"I went this past July for Summerlicious and the food was absolutely horrible - worst Summerlicious I've ever experienced! First off, I must credit the restaurant for having a fantastic view. Our server was decent and offered to take our picture at the table but he was hard to flag down throughout the dinner. Now back to the food. I had the PEI Lobster tail as my appetizer, pistachio crusted rack of lamb, and vanilla/pistachio gelato for dessert. The lobster tail was decent but the risotto cake that accompanied it was disgusting. I ordered my lamb medium rare and it arrived almost well done. On top of that, there was barely any pistachio on the lamb! I was hoping dessert would save the day (how hard can it be to mess up gelato?) but Toula has managed to destroy the last dish as well. The gelato they served would make any Italian ashamed. The flavors tasted fake and sugary... I only had one taste of each flavor and dropped my spoon.  Overall, Toula is not worth going at all for Summerlicious. I actually asked if they had the regular menu but that wasn't available during Summerlicious time. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The location of the restaurant is easy to get to but parking was a joke.  $40 flat rate for valet parking?  Are you kidding me?  And of course the hotel did not offer parking which I found surprising as most hotels in Toronto do.  I had to drop off my 90 year old grandmother at the doors and then went to 3 different lots to find parking (all which were either $15 or $20) and then had to walk all the way back in my high heels.  So far not a good start.  What I thought was odd as well was that the restaurant called me literally 30 minutes prior to my dinner reservation to confirm that I was coming.  Odd.  I would think they would call to confirm earlier in the day or the day before.   When we got to the restaurant we were seated right away and had a view of Lake Ontario (very nice view).  The service was prompt though I found the waiter to hover a lot while we were dining.  We ordered some drinks and the Blue Hawaiian tasted like it had no alcohol in it and the Peach Cobbler was so strong that you already felt the alcohol halfway through your drink!  The red house wine was average. Now on to the food.  The Summerlicious menu sounded amazing and we were drooling over the descriptions of what the dishes included.  For the appetizers we had ordered the Grilled Tiger Shrimp, The Atlantic Smoked Salmon and the Toula Grand Tagliere Misto.  The Grilled Tiger Shrimp only came with two shrimps.  The Atlantic Smoked Salmon was served missing the lemon rubbed crostini and the Bermuda onion jam.  When we mentioned this to our waiter he had to get the Summerlicious menu to double check and then said he would bring out the correct dish.  When they brought out the second dish it had a plan crostini on it and was STILL MISSING the Bermuda onion jam (we didn't bother send it back for the 3rd time).  The Toula Grand Tagliere Misto stated it was served with Artisan Cheeses from Italy so I had expected more than one kind (there was only one kind of cheese and not that appetizing).  Also, this appetizer was MISSING the caramelized fruit preserves which were stated on the menu it came with.  I didn't bother to send it back since the Atlantic Smoked Salmon couldn't come out of the kitchen right after the second time. For the main course the Grilled Certified Angus Center Cut Beef Tenderloin was great.  The Handmade Canadian Atlantic Lobster Ravioli was great but looked like a dish you could get at East Side Mario's.  The Seared Over Roasted Mediterranean Sea Bass Branzino Filet \"Aqua Paza\" with a Tomato, Caper, Chilli Caponata was not served as described.  There was no tomato and no chilli caponata.  Instead it was served on a bed of watery risotto with corn in it.  The Provimi Veal Medallions I had ordered medium well and then had to send it back as it came out medium rare.  The Veal was also described as Provimi Veal Medallions, Topped with Fontina Cheese Fondue, Black Truffle Norcia Slices, Prosecco Risotto.  Well, my veal dish was missing the fontina cheese fondue and black truffle Norcia slices and was served on the same watery bed of risotto with corn as the sea bass was served on so I don't think I got the Prosecco Risotto.   Finally dessert.  The Tiramisu was excellent, the Chocolate Paradiso Torta was a rounded shaped piece of cake (not a slice of tort) but still delicious.  The Courvoisier Pear and Rhubarb Crumble was another disappointment.  The crumble was cold, missing rhubarb entirely, the pears tasted like pears from a can and the gelato was more like vanilla ice cream. We were truly disappointed with our experience at TOULA.  If you aren't going to serve as dish as stated than don't bother serving it.  It may seem like no big deal to some if we were missing the Bermuda onion jam or black truffle Norcia slices but to us it was a big deal as we had never tasted these things before and were looking forward to doing so.  Also, it was described in detail on the menu they were offering.  Also, I couldn't believe that they had to check they Summerlicious menu to verify if the Atlantic Smoked Salmon came with what we said it was supposed to come with.  Then after verifying it they brought out the dish incorrect and still missing an item!!!  I don't know what was going on with the kitchen staff but they were obviously not paying attention to detail. When we left I thought the restaurant was quite busy but I noticed that they were seating everyone on the side with the view of Lake Ontario and there was no one on the other side of the restaurant. I'm glad we tried this restaurant during the Summerlicious menu and not on their regular menu because I would have been even more upset with the way dishes were served.  I can see now why the restaurant gets poor ratings.  In my opinion it was not worth the drive from Oshawa to Toronto to experience Toula."}
{"text":"The worst food and service I've ever experienced I've been there for the new year eve 2015 it was a disaster , bad food rotten meat angry and aggressive owner and staff I wish if I could rate it zero"}
{"text":"So I was here yesterday for Winterlicious. I heard from a few friends that Toula isn't good but I decided to give it a try anyway. After last night, I will never return again.  People usually come here for the view but since it was so foggy and snowy, the view was only okay. I think going in summer would be better.  The food took me by surprise - in a bad way. I ordered the lobster martini for appetizer. It was cheaply made - two tiny pieces of \"lobster\" and the rest is all salad. I got the steak for main course, but the portion was so small that I thought I was having an afternoon snack. Like seriously, it was super small that my stomach was only half full after the whole meal. I got a chocolate parfait for dessert, but my own homemade parfait would've tasted much better than theirs.  Here's the worst part, SERVICE. When we got our bills, we were told we couldn't get separate bills, but we could still pay separately. We expected the waiter to bring us the visa machine that you would normally see at any other restaurants, turns out we had to give our credit cards to him because they don't have those machines AND WE HAD TO TELL HIM HOW MUCH WE WERE PAYING. Like what the crap? What kind of restaurant does that?! Aren't you supposed to do the calculations? But the waiter still managed to mess up and thought we didn't include tips when we already did. Even throughout the night his service was very unprofessional.   The whole meal was not worth the price. I expected the portions to be bigger and the service to be better. Would not return again; once is enough."}
{"text":"I was an invited guest, so I can't comment on the prices.  However, 7 of the 8 people at the table ordered a steak of some sort (filet or striploin), and not one of us got the proper meat temperatures. That has got to be some sort of record."}
{"text":"Horrible food!!!! No! No! No! Don't do it!   Everything was bland. The food quality was poor and extremely overpriced. Genuinely the grossest steak I've ever had in my life. $51 for 8oz with absolutely no flavour, it was bearable with added salt. Seafood spaghetti was a joke, defrosted seafood on a bed of undercooked spaghetti & lots of salt.   Our waitress (mackalya) was very nice, pleasant and professional. Although we were initially greeted by someone else who was the opposite of nice and pleasant.   Nice wine selection, and amazing view. But I wouldn't give more than one star. I can't express how horrible the food is.   Just don't dine here. $300 : for one appetizer, $50 bottle of wine and two mains, you can do a lot better in the city."}
{"text":"- Over priced for a simple menu. Not worth the price. - Snobby staff that only take care of the older crowd that they perhaps think can afford to give a better tip, that they really do not deserve. The girls that work there do nothing but talk with an attitude and give dirty looks. No one even offered to take our coats, but every other couple there was waited on hand and foot. Apparently there is no dress code, because, while we were dressed to the nines, others were in track pants, etc which made no difference in their service either.  It seemed as though we were an inconvenience, and that they were just trying to get rid of us. Even though we were extremely nice and gave our waiter an amazing tip which we really shouldn't have! Worst experience.Will never dine there again!! I've had better service at McDonalds."}
{"text":"Toula has two things going for it: the food and the view. However, the portions were smaller than expected, leaving something (aka more food) to be desired. The service leaves even more to be desired. I had the smoked salmon arugula appetizer, lobster ravioli and crumble with gelato and a latte - all enjoyable. Food was great and I was with good company, but the service was very standoffish. They definitely pander after the older crowd. I might be dining from a Summerlicious menu, but that doesn't mean I'm going to be a bad tipper."}
{"text":"We had a table of 10 for Summerlicious.  First of all, the waiter was off putting when he rudely told us to finish our basket of bread first before he would give us another basket. There were only 2 baskets placed on the table when we had a large group, so it was obvious it wasn't enough. The waiter then loudly announced that because we are doing Summerlicious,  we had to be on one bill, ready to order at the same time and we are each given a number. I felt that we were treated very poorly because we were doing Summerlicious,  don't know why Toula bother to participate if they don't like people ordering from the special menu. Even with the special menus, we all had drinks and spent good money, but was treated like we were getting a handout. Throughout the whole meal, our waiter treated us very poorly and spoke down to us. I am sure people at soup kitchens are treated with more respect than we were. The view is great and the food is pretty good, however, the service is horrible.  Great way to promote yourselves, Toula...I rather eat at 360 if I am looking for a restaurant with a view. They treat me like a human being,"}
{"text":"The after dinner mint was the best part of this meal.  The service was absolutely terrible from the moment we say down.  The waitress wanted to take our order when we hadn't gotten water or drinks yet.    Appetizers were OK, nothing special about tomatoes soup or Caesar salad.    The veal medallions came out so well done it was actually impressive.  My friend actually mentioned something to the waitress and she rolled her eyes and asked what he wanted her to do about it.  Ended up sending it back for a filet cooked medium which came out no more than 3 minutes later and looked like it had been under a warmer all night.  Desert was good, nothing amazing but made up for the main course.  Like I said, the little candies on the way out were delicious but not worth the $80 I spent for my meal."}
{"text":"Came to Toula from a recommendation, and decided to try out the summerlicious menu.   Food: I ordered he Caesar salad with the hopes it would be a gourmet or more elevated Caesar, but it was a regular salad you could make at home, with one tiny shrimp on it with dried bacon. The menu said it had Parmesan chips on it but it didn't come with that. The scallops were also sandy and not cleaned properly. We got the steak as our main, and asked for medium rare, and it came to us medium well. Nothing was seasoned and the veggies were pretty much raw. Our friend ordered the sword fish and it was dry and overcooked. The mashed potatoes I'm almost 100% positive were boxed powdered potatoes. They were like glue and tasted like boxed mashed potatoes (I lived off of boxed mashed potatoes in college, it's a taste and texture you can't forget) It wasn't the worst food but definitely not the best, especially in terms of quality, definitely not worth the price had we paid regular price.  Service:  Service started off good, but when we declined to buy drinks, the waiter became almost immediately rude. He would pour everyone's water and skip mine cause I was in the corner, he would pick up everyone's plates but mine and make me give him my plate, and he was very inattentive and didn't ask us how the food was once. For a place that's supposed to be a bit classier, I would expect much better service, but the waiter just seemed like he couldn't get rid of us any faster. He also yelled at us when we asked where the ATM was in an annoyed voice \"Around the corner!!!\" Without providing actual direction.  Overall: We are not fancy people and we rarely get to go dine at nice places, Summerlicious allows us to try fine food without burning a hole in our wallets. We felt like the waiter was annoyed with us the whole time and wanted to get us out. The food was okay but had too many mistakes. I give the view a 5/5, food a 3/5 and the service 2/5. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We were surprised by the experience over all for a downtown high end restaurant .  I start with parking, we arrived and no valet parking and the service man at the door send you to a nearby outdoor parking for 30 dollars instead of a nearby building which was 15. It took us 15-20 min to find it. The food was not good, and the service even worse. Salad came as if it was taken off the salad mix bag and thrown on the plate. No taste, flavour.Sea bas comes with Black Olive, Sundried Tomato & Caper Tapenade Crust, with Risotto and Zucchini (on paper), however it came with only Risotto and zucchini with the fish on top, and when you ask the waiter why it was missing other ingredients as per the menu, the answer was more insulting to our intelligence as he said \"its mixed with the Risotto and you can smell it \"!  We asked for the manager (Kenny) and to be honest he was quite nice and professional and apologized for what happened and offered free coffee, deserts and took the sea bas off the bill and he did acknowledge that we were right to question the meal. one of the main courses was late for 15 minutes and same scenario, the waiter said blatantly \"the computer just crashed and the last order didn't go through\"  Chairs were rocking and full of dirty spots  Any way, this experience gave us no hope ever to come back again."}
{"text":"understaffed, noisy, very disappointed  we went to toula on the first day of winterlicious. it was totally different experience of what i got two years ago. the restaurant was very understaffed. we waited two hours for the main course to come. as a restaurant, you know you are expecting a large group of guests during winterlicious event, but still unprepared? servers were not as professional as expected. rude! gave us an annoying look when we ask for separate bill. furthermore, the lavatory sanitation was poor. at least two of the lavatories in ladies room was wet on the floor, they has been like that at the beginning of my dinner, and still the same at the end of my dinner! how impressing! no one cleaned the wet, messy lavatories for three hours. this is not our first time at toula, but it will definitely be the last!"}
{"text":"I went here for summerlicious with 3 other friends so we were able to order most things on the menu. Every plate was just awful. The \"handmade tagliatelle pasta\" tasted gritty and was not properly made. \"Fresh\"? I think not. The veal was so overcooked that it tasted like cardboard, and both the salmon and cornish hen were completely dry. I don't know how this restaurant managed to last so long since they couldn't get a single thing on the menu right.  The desserts were also disappointing. I sent my \"Homemade strawberry and vanilla bavarese\" back because there were bits of gelatin that were not fully melted. The waiter told me that it was a \"very popular dessert\" and that it was just \"my personal preference\". I was stunned that he tried to argue with me even after I told him that it wasn't made properly. I asked if he could just bring me the \"Toula classic homemade vanilla gelato\" thinking that a gelato would be hard to screw up. However, it clearly wasn't a gelato but some ice cream that they dug out from the back of a freezer because it was filled with ice crystals. The tiramisu was nothing special.   The service at this restaurant is appalling. The restaurant was barely half filled on a Saturday afternoon (I guess people already know this restaurant is terrible) so there were a lot of servers just awkwardly standing around. When out waiter brought our desserts at once, my dessert plate crushed the corner of the tiramisu that he was holding in the same hand. I'm pretty sure he saw it since it was quite hard to go unnoticed, but he did nothing about it. We asked for a new one, but it took them more than 10 minutes to bring it to us.   The view is great. That's the one good thing I can say about this restaurant.   I'm never coming back to this place again. It's a shame that I wasted my time and money on this restaurant with so many other great ones participating in Summerlicious."}
{"text":"Personally, I thought this place totally lived up to all the hype. Went with Nash and Jim Halsey... they loved it.  On another note, I have to question any Yelp review that begins \"Last night I joined my friend Cracker and her crew...\" Scroll down and see. Was the chick who wrote it 12???"}
{"text":"There was only one good thing about this restaurant which was the view of the CN tower and all of Toronto, and unfortunately it doesn't make up for the fact that they were out of so many supplies to make so many things on the menu. When I finally got my simple spaghetti and meatballs, the meat was so dry the spaghetti slowly seeping through my fork that I had to eat it with the spoon and the service was slower.  I have no clue how zagat rated that good to excellent, or how some of the average ratings for a \"5 star restaurant\" was a 4.5, but if there was a way to put less than 1 star, believe me I would."}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's birthday party with low expectations after reading countless bad reviews.. and it pretty much lived up (or down?) to those expectations!  My experience started off fine, the server seemed quite helpful (contrary to my what I'd read, which was a surprise) and explained to me what many of the pasta dishes were (because I'm uncultured and the menu is in Italian). Anyway, while this was great, the service progressively worsened throughout the night. The service was slow, the waiters never came by to check on us (so our water was never refilled), and we had to finally get up and hunt them down when we wanted our bill. When we asked for separate bills, our waiter made it seem as if we had asked him to do the unthinkable.. and then told us that it would be about a 15 minute wait for our bills. I found this to be very unreasonable considering that there were maybe 5 other tables filled in the entire restaurant and that most of the staff seemed to be standing around doing nothing.. splitting a bill should NOT take so long. After we finally received and paid for our bills, I luckily (for my friend) noticed that they had accidentally charged my meal to my friend's credit card, and so fixing that took at least another 10 minutes.   In terms of the food I didn't find it horrible but it also wasn't too great. What I ordered was very good (I don't even remember what it was called, it was a long, wide, flat pasta with mushrooms and some other things.. really tasty). My friends who ordered the ravioli weren't so lucky unfortunately, as there were (and we counted) 9 pieces of ravioli given to them for $30. Compared to everyone else's pasta dishes, theirs looked like maybe 1/4 of a meal. My friend who ordered the steak wasn't happy with the way they cooked it either, and had to send it back to be cooked more (which also took forever). Overall, I think that the food is very hit-and-miss here.. but I would definitely recommend the weird pasta that I got (even though I can't remember what it was called!) if you decide to go.   The view is great, the food is alright (depending on what you order), and the service is generally crappy. I would recommend considering other options before resorting to this place, but it wasn't a HORRIBLE experience. If the service wasn't so below-average, I think that this place could really have a chance."}
{"text":"I stayed in Westin and went there for summerlicious. The service and food are terrible. Cannot be worse."}
{"text":"Came for summerlicious 2017. I'm not even sure if that dinner was worth $38 and they add an automatic gratuity of around 20% on top of it.   We had to ask for clean coffee cups twice as the ones they brought still had coffee stains in them or at the bottom. The waiter tried to make a joke when he realised that the second cup was dirty by saying that \"I don't think, you want that one eh?\" as he proceeds to try to remove the inside stain with his fingers....  Food was sub par: -2 Toula Alaskan King Crab & Avocado Tower-weird color of the crab and avocado..as if left out too long outside to dry -Grand Toula Wooden Board with a variety of D.O.P. cured meats & cheese which was nice -AAA Certified Beef Tenderloin  served with sautéed mushrooms in a chardonnay sauce, mashed Yukon potatoes & seasonal vegetables-asked for rare beef and it was fully cooked -PEI Lobster Tagliolini in rose' sauce finished by pomodorini confit-tiny piece of lobster drowned in a humongous amount of pasta -Free range Cornish Hen served in rustic Tuscany style tomato sauce, seasonal vegetables and crostino-tiny piece of hen..ok I guess it's because it's a cornish hen or ..maybe part of it? -Tiramisu' del Toula'-cheap looking cake, did not even want to ask the one who ordered it how it tasted -Belgium Chocolate Parfait with Raspberry Coulis-The name should have been brown oatmeal gunk in tinfoil w/ 2 drops of coulis and some random fruits on the plate. I kept thinking where was the chocolate and the coulis..  Maybe it was our unlucky day: one waiter was handling glasses on the counter behind us and he ended breaking them on the counter, spraying shards of glass everywhere and some went in the hair of my friend and her clothes. Thanks goodness she was giving her back to him and the glasses did not fall on her nor hurt her.   The scenic elevator also appears not to work, restaurant is in bad need of renovation and the washrooms-ladies..if you can hold and go to Union Station's washroom instead, please do so.. On the other side, the view was ok if you're willing to pay $50+++ more for it. As for the food, skip the view and go somewhere else knowing that Toronto has much better restaurants."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a winterlicious lunch menu at a fixed price of $23 plus tax. We were seated at a table for 4 people by the window looking over the CN Tower. It was a stunning view with good food, friendly service and nice atmosphere that we very much enjoyed the moment we had for the afternoon lunch. I really like the smoke salmon for the appetizer, lamb shank for the main course and tiramisu for the dessert..... Unbelievable price with delicious food!"}
{"text":"The place looked great, the view was amazing and the service was excellent. Went here during summerlcious and My first impression was really positive. My shrimp appetizer was good despite of the small portion, literally two pieces. I was really disappointed with my lobster raviole however. It was edible but not great. Tiramisu was good but you cant go wrong with tiramisu. Im just glAd that only cost me $35 because I would have been upset if I had to pay the regular price for that meal."}
{"text":"worst place i have ever been before in my life, if you are thinking of going there don't the food is something that i have never seen before. i have been to many restaurants and this one is by far the worst ever. my dog eats better food then what this place gives out. only good thing from there is my feet where warm by the heater and the nice view of the water front. was not impressed by the valet parking but i can live with that. had soup that was mushroom soup with blended mushrooms with water and salt and boiling hot, shrimp was dead 1 year before i got it made me throw up, stake was (to be med well) was swimming in its own blood, last of all the chocolate cake that was hard as a brick and tasted like shoe leather no taste what so ever, i know as a fact Betty crocker makes a better cake out of a box. my first and last time i ever step foot in this restaurant if i could i would give it -5 stars  very very disappointed"}
{"text":"How have I never heard of this place?  The view is perfect for giving visiting friends a taste of the city (take the scenic elevator up and just have a drink at the bar, though--food is pricy!)  I ate a Winterlicious meal here last week, and it was quite good--small portions, but perfectly cooked seafood and nice, light desserts.  Service was prompt--each course came out quickly and we didn't spend any time waiting.  If I had friends visiting town, I'd recommend they have a drink here, but for food there are better options."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The food was average at best, the decor is falling apart and outdated. The waiter was good, he knew the kitchen was behind and thus brought bread, that is until the busboy decided that we weren't allowed any more bread. Maybe if the place was more organized we wouldn't have needed it. The manager was on his cell phone at the front, not really my idea of professional. The view of the harbour is good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again"}
{"text":"The shittiest services I've every received. The waiter had an attitude. The waiter took forever with my food. The food had no seasoning. The mail came up to 120 and I honestly did not appreciate it. I think it's time for them to re do there menu or get a different chef that knows what seasoning is. The only thing I enjoyed was my shrimp appetizer. N my wine * white Zinfandel* I could've purchased 2 bottles for the price I paid for 2 glasses. This restaurant is straight up shity and I would not suggest it to anyone. Had to wait 30 mins to get hot water for my tea. But the bread was on fleek thou.  And that water was amazing  never again."}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious lunch with some friends around noon. we were seated and greeted by the server promptly.   Overall service: good Overall food: disappointing   For appetizer I got the mushroom tower. since it had the word \"tower\" i was expecting something spectacular. however, it turned out to be a piece of polenta cake with a few pieces of mushrooms inside, covered in a sauce. my friends got the salmon and that looked really great. so get that instead!   For main course I got the poletta. tasted ok, but it's not something that I cant make at home myself. The meal was just warm enough, but not very hot. my other friends complained the same thing.   For dessert I got the creme brulee. honestly, the WORST creme brulee I have ever had in my life. It looked really nice when it came out, but once you crack into the sugar crust, the creme brulee starts running. it looked like melted ice cream or something. it certainly isnt supposed to be runny, it should have a firm texture like jello or something.   My friend brought the issue to the server and the server was nice make it up to us.   So service was good, but the quality of food was very disappointing for such a classy restaurant. and for the food value I received, $25 was way too much. I dont recommend going there for winterlicious. or summerlicious."}
{"text":"We went there for Winterlicious and got the set menu. Total with tax and tip is $50. I have to start by saying the service was excellent. From the hostess, the coat check, and the waitress. We were seated right away by the window. The view is amazing and the ambiance was very romantic.  We ordered the king crab tower salad and beef carpaccio as starters. The tower salad was excellent made with avocado. The beef carpaccio was served with an apple compote and was below average - bland and without taste. I ordered the lobster with handmade taglioline. The lobster was not fresh and was overcooked and lacked flavor and the pasta was below average. My friend ordered the beef tenderloin and said it was good.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate mousse cake and the Ricotta mousse served with a biscuit. Both were good. The service and view was fantastic but the food left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Came for Summerlicious with a group of friends.  The view was great the food was not. Instead of \"scallops\" as advertised on the menu each plate cams with one singular scallop. Moreover the scallop app had pistachio nuts which were not mentioned on the menu, which is rather disappointing for someone with nut allergies. The main portion sizes were equally underwhelming. The lobster ravioli might as well have been made with yam and cheese because you can't taste the four tiny bits of lobster mixed in. Dessert was meh. Get the tort with passion fruit for the passion fruit, and don't bother finishing the tort."}
{"text":"Bad food options, bad services, too over priced. They tipped themselves on the bill even tho the services were crap. We literally waited for our food for 20 mins to come, and apparently the servers didn't even care.   $16 for the salad, plate was huge but the actual food portion was TINY. I'd rather go get McDonald's salad than theirs.   I'm giving a star just to the view, but still, I would not recommend this place to anyone.    PS. They don't take DEBIT CARD, stupid right ?:/"}
{"text":"It's weird seeing all these bad reviews for Toula.  Makes me wonder if we even went to the same restaurant.    TM and I came here for a Summerlicious lunch and we were seated right by the window with an amazing view of the lake, islands and boats.  A lovely summertime date.  Personally I think this view is better than the 360 restaurant at the CN Tower (even without the spinning).  I ordered the smoked salmon app and roasted cornish hen.  I finished it off with the dark chocolate panna cotta.  TM ordered the same salmon app, ricotta/spinach ravioli in butter/sage sauce and creme brulee.  The smoked salmon was light and refreshing with just the right amount of salt and acid.  My hen was moist and delicious, however I found TM's ravioli to lack in flavour slightly.  He enjoyed it, but I was expecting a bit more.  The portion was a tad small (I knew TM would need a post lunch snack) and I guess in value it just didn't compare to the other plates being offered.  I thought it was a little basic, and they could have added some more oomph to it.  Don't vegetarian options deserve a bit more sizzle?  Desserts were OK - but please don't take my word for it.  I don't have that much of a sweet tooth and I find I have to be in the mood to really enjoy desserts.  Don't mean to sound indifferent about the dessert, but that was the kinda day it was.    Overall a solid and enjoyable lunch and a steal at only $20!"}
{"text":"My bf brought me here for Summerlicious yesterday evening, mainly because of the view.  I had:  Insalata di Boragina: nice presentation, but too much oil in that vinaigrette Black Truffle-Stuffed Cornish Hen: the name is deceptive. You'd think it was an actual cornish hen; instead I received 2 medallions of poultry. It was moist and flavourful, but the portion was disappointing. Tiramisu: Not the best I've had. The biscotti needed to really be soaked in espresso though; these ones were kind of dry.  He had:  Toula Grand Wood Board Tagliere Misto: He said it was alright; a little salty (but then again it's all cured meats) Fire Roasted Rack of Lamb: it was done medium-well cooked. After tasting my cornish hen we both agree that the lamb needed to be seasoned for a little longer. Fresh Fruit Tart with Homemade Gelato: No complaints.  Our server was great! He was very sharp, and had some good tips for the meat. We did feel rushed though. We had barely finished our appetizers when they brought our entrees (but the plates were warm so we knew they were prepared fresh, which was great!). Dessert took a little longer to come, but we were fine with that as we were enjoying each other's company and the view (we had the city view which was great!). After being seated for about 1.5 hours (we had finished dessert) a man in a suit (I'm assuming he was the manager) came over and asked us to leave as he needed to have the table prepared for the next couple coming in. Had we been told that this was a busy night and how long we'd be allowed to stay then it wouldn't have totally thrown us off. But we understood as it was a pretty busy night (for a Thursday I was really surprised).  We agreed we *might* come back to Toula....probably not for the food, but the view. And even with that, there are other restaurants like Panorama-180 and Canoe for that.  Just make sure you're with great company, as I was. It will make up for the average food."}
{"text":"I've never walked out of a restaurant before after eating one bite of our entire.  This place was revolting.  Went there for Winterlicious with my family. As vegetarians it appeared to have lots of options.   My son had the \"tofu roll\". It was a slab of tofu on some lettuce - nothing \"roll\" about it. The bread basket of bread came with a crumbled was of gum.   After about an hour and a half our mains came - my daughter got the Chef's signature pasta - I've never seen pasta look like dog vomit before. My wife and son got the beet risotto - undercooked, no flavour, just mush. The broccoli pesto pasta that I got was just gross.   One bite into it we grabbed our coats, spoke to the manager and walked out.   Do not go here."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the negative reviews are about.  We went there with a party of 17 people and had a great experience.  Absolutely no wait to get in (we had reservations), the staff was extremely courteous and accommodating to our needs. Our waiter, Khaled, was very professional and exceptionally knowledgeable.  He was always around filling our water and making sure we had everything we needed.  The food selection was part of Summerlicious, and was well worth the value.  Everyone in our party was extremely happy with their selections.  Between the 17 of us we tried everything on the menu and it all looked, and tasted, great.  The focaccia bread was served warm, always refilled, and so good!  The scenery is exceptional, we had fun watching the planes land and take-off from the Island Airport.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I had been to this restaurant for a great Winterlicious meal and chose to go back for a special celebration - what a mistake - especially the food.  We ordered scallop appetizer - there was sand in the scallops and they were undercooked and bland.  Tried the mushroom appetizer - sauteed mushrooms in a slimy sauce that had no taste.  The pasta with lobster was horrible - had a terrible tinny taste.  The veal special was delicious.  The shrimp and tuna pasta was not bad.  2 out of 3 of us came home not feeling well.  They were also out of 2 of their regular pasta dishes at 7 pm on a Friday night?????? It it wasn't for our waitress who was attentive, polite and understanding it would have been a horrible evening.  View was good - for an expensive \"high end\" restaurant, most people were very under-dressed and I would think hotel guests.  We should have stuck with our favourite restaurants that are 5 minutes from home - next year!"}
{"text":"This review is for winterlicious 2014.   One word to sum up the whole event: sucked  - Service sucked: lemon for water came 20min later, heating air is too strong that made so dried for me to sit around, coffee came way later than sugar and milk, milk container had old aged yellow line which was pretty gross. Coffee- worse than my church coffee- watered down, no taste coffee. Can't even get coffee right, so should I even say more about food?   - Food sucked: food? I'm sorry, was that \"food\" we consumed and paid for?   Parking: really expensive. 6.5$ every half hour. I guess I'm really paying for the view."}
{"text":"Do not come here on winterlicious.  Arrived at 8.25 PM for an 8.30 reservation, still not seated at 9.15. The waiting area is packed like a rush hour streetcar. Other folks are probably getting seated tomorrow."}
{"text":"We have had dinner at Toula's before and once again thoroughly enjoyed the meal and service. The view as always is spectacular."}
{"text":"Sad such a beautiful view is wasted on mediocre restaurant.  Reception was welcoming, view is fantastic.  Surprised by plastic chairs.  Not at all cohesive with  this menu/restaurant.  Service was lackluster and I waited at every course.  The tables were busy and I watched others wait too.   Being close to the kitchen, all I heard was the cook ringing the bell, not just ding-ding, I'm talking repeatedly to where he was banging on it 5-6 rings per time and it was very distracting.  Food was average, focaccia was dry.  Wine menu was nothing exciting either.  Food flavors really didn't jump out.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Toula's is definitely an enjoyable experience.  I don't understand the negative reviews personally.  They have a decent wine list but it's a little on the pricier side.  We ordered a bottle of amarone and enjoyed the view from our window seat.  It was a very nice atmosphere with the only downside being the louder than normal chatter of other patrons.  On our last visit we had a nice beef carpaccio to start with a the charcuterie and cheese plate.  There were some very nice italian cheeses, some of which I had not had the experience to try before  Unfortunately they were out of the cornish hen as well as quail, so we opted for the beef tenderloin and the porterhouse.  Both were delicious, tender and cooked to perfection.    We ended our meal with a couple of glasses of icewine with the tiramisu and creme brule, both of which were great the brule shining through a little more.   I would definitely recommend Toula's to anyone but be prepared for a pricier meal than average."}
{"text":"Location: The restaurant is visable from the ground (round tower off the Westin Harbour Castle). Parking is ridiculous. The hotel's rate is $40. Save that money, spend $20 to park at the lot just east of the hotel, or underground in the Waterpark Place building (both lots accessible off Queens Quay). Other lots are further away and for a comparable price (sometimes more depending on events at the ACC).  Walk into the lobby of the hotel and head left to the south tower. Take the SCENIC elevator up so you can see the Toronto skyline!!  Facility: Decor is outdated but not horrid. Chairs were old \"conference style\" and difficult to leave purses/bags on. I put my clutch directly on the table. View was amazing, but for some reason, the window where we sat was dirty. Washroom was fine, clean and maintained. There is a vanity area for the ladies but no full length mirror. When you head to the washroom, go down the stairs, not up (no signs to indicate).  Food Quality & Price: Regular dishes and drinks were pricey. My husband ordered a Stella and it cost $10. Ridiculous. The Summerlicious menu had a decent selection. I had the Grand Tagliere Misto which was average. A little too much salami, not enough cheese and prosciutto. Smoked salmon was alright. Girlfriend ordered the shrimp (wrapped in bacon) to start, which tasted fine, but there were only two. Compared to everyone else's apps, it was not enough.   For the entree, portions looked small, but it was the \"just right\" amount, in my opinion. Mediocre averages all around for the ravioli and beef tenderloin. I really enjoyed my veal medallions with Prosecco Risotto.   Desert seemed to be everyone's favourite course. Our table liked their tiramisu and chocolate torta. My favourite was definitely the Pear and Rhubarb Crumble by a landslide.  It seems that Toula stepped up their food judging from the reviews from last year. However, service still leaves much to be desired.  Service: Westin hotel staff were warm and friendly. When we reached the restaurant, the hostess accommodated my request for a window seat. We were seated promptly. However, the girls who work at the restaurant were very young (late teens, early twenties?) and wore all black club dresses. I don't mind tattoos as much as the next girl, but in a fine dining establishment, professional dress codes should be enforced.  Our party received very mixed (hit and miss) service. The waiter would forget that we asked for more bread as we waited a ridiculous amount of time for our starters (30 minutes?). He kept asking about drinks from the bar and briskly ran away as soon as someone hesitated. However, he did promptly clear the table and bring out drinks quickly once ordered.   Overall: Toula is an okay restaurant to try for Summerlicious, but I would not come for regular prices. The prices certainly do not reflect the atmosphere, service or quality of food. I didn't have a horrible experience as reflected in other reviews, but that said, I don't think I would return. There is no dress code, our group was business casual (as were most others), but those in jeans/sweatpants were still served and seated. You are paying for the view... in which case, I would go to 360 in the CN Tower."}
{"text":"This place is a SCAM!!!!! I bought a wagjag voucher for this place and went with my boyfriend because I wanted to give him a nice present and a beautiful evening. It was supposed to be a nice 4 course dinner and it gave us the menu of what to choose. We both chose the sea bass since we don't eat meat. We were expecting to get a delicious sea bass but what they actually served is was tilapia! Everyone knows tilapia is much less expensive than sea bass so when i asked him what it is he said it was \"european sea bass\". Now I know for next time that that means tilapia. As for the dessert course what really got my mouth watering on the menu was the home made peach tart with hazelnut ice cream. When it came time to order it the waiter told me they dont have peach only pear so I went with pear which was a bad choice! It was dry and disgusting and there was no ice cream that came with it either! Overall it was a bad experience and I would not go back"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Toula. The view of the restaurant is fantastic, and the service is really warm and helpful. The food was amazing, we had a wonderful night!!"}
{"text":"I like the view and the atmosphere. Also this place was pretty much empty every time I went there. Food is okay and pricier than it should be but I enjoyed the experience.  I did valet parking and it cost me $25."}
{"text":"Overpriced, outdated and the slowest service I have ever experienced. Tragic for such a unique location"}
{"text":"Not impressive with the food and decor, service is pretty good tho, this is my first time here, and it will the last time."}
{"text":"Bad. Bad bad service. We had a reservation but still waited for 1.5 hour. I walked around and noticed only 2/3 of the restaurant was filled up. The hostess was an idiot. Food was mediocre. It was Not Fine dining."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give them a star if It was an option.  We went to Toula in a group of 13 guests. I was really looking forward for it because it's \"high-class fine dining\" supposingly! However, we were extremly disappointed.   The food was terrible! I ordered an appetizer (crab cake with avocado) and it was $25. It had a very strong fishy unpleasant smell and taste! It was not worth the price!I personally ordered rack of lamb. The meat was soso and it's overprices for the quality of meat. The flavour was soso. It was dry. The worst part was the side dishes (potatoes), one of them gone bad. Well, it was just one not big deal so I didn't mention about it! However, I did later and you will see why.  One of my friend ordered Gnocchi and it tasted like powder was was uncooked covered in cheese. She didn't eat her meal!   My other friend ordered salmon steak! It was so rough and fully cooked that by the time she had 3/4 of the salmon, her inner mouth was Bleeding.   The service was also not good! The waiter kept on walking in and out and in and out that he was disturbing our conversation! He was also being rude and barely had a smile on his face! We actually mentioned to the manager that we want to change the waiter and he said alright! However, he lied! The same waitress all night long!  After all the above, we decided to make a complaint to the manager! And guess what, the manager don't seem to give a damn to all of the above. He has no intention of taking the complaint seriously and he just wanted us to shut up about it! He was being very sarcastic when we told him about my friend's inner mouth bleeding. He thought we just wanted free meals or something!  He was being sarcastic about asking the paramedics for help. But we are not cheap and we always eat in high-end restaurant! This is professionalism issue!   At the end, he ended up freeing 3 main courses! Mine, the gnocchi, and the salmon! We're happy that we don't have to pay for the unhappy meals but it was just still really disappointing. They also gave us free champange. I know it sounds pretty nice here! But we still wouldn't go back! Quality is crap!   When the bill came, something went wrong so my friend went up to the counter and asked if the bill was ready! The waiter was really rude and answered him \"N0, it's not ready yet!\" My friend later complained and they also end up freeing his meal of the night! Isn't that hilarious? Just complain and they would free the courses haha.   Overall, totally way overpriced! I think even Alice Fazooli's was better! No need to spend so much money on some crappy service and food! All you get it the view!"}
{"text":"Awful.....was there with a group....asked for the minestrone soup....was brought broccoli soup...(yesterdays broccoli) and was told it was cream of mushroom....what were they thinking....many other guests complained of burnt salmon and not only was the food not good, service confused but the prices over the top.....never again......the hotel below (westin) has way better food and should just take over....this place being called an Italian restaurant in Toronto is an insult to anyone who has Italian heritage...not even close....."}
{"text":"Went to Toula for summerliciuous.  I hope the staff read this.  Your in the \"wow\" business.  But for $23 I should not expect to be wowed.     3 choices of wine.  I tried the $50 red from Chili and opted for Italian for 55.  Both wines were terrible.  I started with minestrone soup.  It was bla Before I could finish soup I watch the server come out with our next dishes.   We haven't finished soup or salad.  He walks back....waits for me to finish and brings my lamb shank on saffron  rice.  COLD AND NOT TASTY.  My guest had the chicken.  Over cooked and cold   Creme Brule was great.  Though server brought me curled milk for coffee.  46 for food 55 for wine  Total= WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.  And some please have the severs clean their black uniforms.  That just shows me one thing....  Anyway.  Not going back.  Restaurant needs a reno and upgrade with food and wine  Later."}
{"text":"Luckily I had read the yelp reviews in advance!  Went for valentines day dinner with my gf. Got the Winterlicious menu,   My meal: Toula amore salad - arugula with a cucumber ring dressed with strawberries pine nuts and olive oil.  Hand made pasta with roasted red peppers, and smoked chicken. ** Strawberry cheesecake   Gf's meal: Smoked salmon on arugula dressed with olive oil. ** Tenderloin steak with asparagus and truffle cheese mashed potatoes.  Peach strudel with hazelnut ice cream.   One flight each of the Pinot grigio.   The food was good though had we come for the other menu I would agree that it is over priced. Left the restaurant full, dot expect the same sized portions as more mainstream places, but you will leave feeling satisfied. **Starred food was exceptional, all others are on par.  Service was fairly good, I had expected worse. The server was funny and made the mood very light, we definitely got one of the better ones! Reservation at 17:00 also worked in our favour.  I would consider this winterlicious event a success! Probably did not gain my loyalty as a future customer, but definitely made me a winterlicious repeater!!"}
{"text":"Loved the view, it was absolutely breath taking! Very beautiful restaurant, it was quite the experience. Unfortunately the food was not worth the price. It wasn't terrible, it was ok, but very overpriced. I was very disappointed with the seafood linguini I had, the scallops were so tiny. I have had better seafood linigui at other establishments. The wines were also very over priced, but I guess you are paying for the experience. I loved the chocolate lava cake though, it was very delicious and I highly reccommend it. Our waiter was very professional, and service was good. I would reccommend this place because of the view and the delicious dessert."}
{"text":"I chose Toula as the last stop for my fiancée to be as I sent her on a whirlwind proposal adventure. The management at Toula were very accommodating and helpful. They made the experience beyond amazing for us. I know that there have been some individuals with less than stellar experiences but from what I've observed, it clearly isn't the norm. I would recommend Toula to anyone in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I do not consider myself a food connoisseur, but I've participated in enough Summerlicious outings to discern between the good and the bad.  Toula was just plain bad.  The only redeeming quality about the restaurant was the view, but if you wanted anything more you will be disappointed.  I already heard a slew of bad reviews from acquaintances going into this dinner, but I was going for the good company.  I choose the Fresh PEI Lobster tail served on a saffron risotto cake finished with citrus buerre blanc and pink peppercorns  for the appetizer, Pesto and roasted pine nut encrusted Chilean sea bass served with saffron risotto and finished with a tarragon cream sauce for the main, and Toula triple chocolate temptation cheesecake topped with marinated blueberries for the dessert.   First of all, the wait staff were terrible.  The main manager who was serving us had an unpleasant scowl on his face the entire evening and was clearly displeased with our table.  It took 20 minutes before they would even take our orders, and a good 30 minutes before they would finally give us our bills.  The waiter(s) mixed up my main dish with my friend's main dish.  I don't know if they are familiar with the hospitality industry but, especially for high end dining establishments, the customer is ALWAYS right.  The largest \"infraction\" our dinner party made throughout the evening was that 4 people arrived about 15-20 minutes later, but the majority of the dinner party was already there.  I cannot believe that the manager would treat us so poorly throughout the evening.  Even if we are Summerlicious customers, we should be treated as if we were regular customers.  Second of all, the food was terrible.  The lobster tail was COLD and overcooked (and therefore uncomfortably chewy), the risotto cake was cold and falling apart and the buerre blanc was sloppily spread across the entire plate.  The sea bass was palatable, but the risotto had a really strange taste to it; again, the main was not served very hot either.  The cheesecake was mediocre at best - nothing that you could not pick up from the supermarket.    I had a terrible dining experience and would definitely NOT recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"A good resto, a bit pricey but good nonetheless, I'd come back for the view and the wine selection."}
{"text":"What an absolute joke of a night...(Valentines Day).  Wanted to have a special night tonight with my girlfriend so I had made reservations for tonight (Feb 14) for a table for 2 at 9pm. We were seated fast, but not by a window seat as I requested and was told there were no window seats available, even though we walked past 2...  Next we were greeted by our waitress who gave us each a glass of water. All tables had at least bread on them, but ours did not, so we waited for the waitress to return...  It's now 11:00pm and we did not even receive an appetizer...2 hours from being seated ON VALENTINES DAY...then what is even more frustrating is that a couple who came in an hour after we've been waiting, is able to be served at least their appetizers...while its now been almost 2.5 hours for us... so we decided to leave, and noticed other couples around us becoming agitated.  Very slow service and very unexpected for a special occasion such as valentines day. The staff is not properly trained to handle large crowds of people or to work in a fast-paced environment and I don't recommend going here as it is lousy service...  I've never been to a restaurant where it takes 2.5 hours to realize our food isn't coming even when we've been told \"it's on the way\" almost 5 times... we received their hors d'ouvres (which were lousy also) after 2.5 hours of waiting. My girlfriend was very disappointed and I was too..  We got to jack astors at 11:40pm tonight and were served food within 20 minutes.   I do not recommend Toula if your occassion is something you really want to impress someone with...go to La Castile or Harbor Sixty Steakhouse you won't be disappointed...as I've learned. Also, the portions are super small and they are totally overpriced. I will not be returning to this joke of a restaurant."}
{"text":"The view in this restaurant is lovely. The ambiance is nice but the faux gold roof is in desperate need of being painted. It looks awful IMHO. I went on a 4 course prix fix menu listing from LivingSocial. We got it for 89 regularly 190. The food was quite good, nice mushroom soup (a little over pureed for my tastes), charcuterie was good, main course was lamb pappardelle which was lovely, and for dessert I had sortbet. (Warning the green is pistachio which they don't warn you of if you have a nut allergy, which I do). Service was very good they didn't rush us and were always attentive. The wine list is extortionate, numerous $12-15 a bottle wines for $15 a glass. Overall I liked the place but the price was really gorging on the tourist crowd. It's all about location location location :)"}
{"text":"A very disappointing night, but we made the best of it and enjoyed some fine company and good cheer together.  My review is quite delayed, though I have been meaning to write this for some time.  My elderly parents live in Bruce County and came to visit me and my husband to have Thanksgiving in the city.  We were excited to host them here because we usually do it at their place up north.  However, due to unforeseen circumstances, as the weekend drew closer, it became clear that we were not going to be able to host it in our home so we had to find another venue to enjoy Thanksgiving with my parents.  There weren't a lot of places open that weekend, so we wound up choosing to go to Toula.  We thought that this would be a remarkable place to share Thanksgiving together.  Living downtown, it had the added benefit of being able to park there, which was a very important feature for my parents who can not walk long distances.  It'd been years since we had all gone there, but we all remembered it very fondly, with it's revolving view of the lake and city, the wonderful food and that \"X\" factor you have when something has a special experience associated to it.  Toula is also connected to a hotel, which we thought would almost guarantee that there would be a Thanksgiving-oriented menu to choose from.  I should have confirmed that in advance. You know what they say about assuming.  In any case, that was one of our several disappointments for the evening.  So, we arrived, granted, with high expectations for a lovely evening.  Well, at least we had each other, and that was enough to be thankful for.  We arrived at the hotel to park our car, $25 right away for parking.  Fine.  We figured the night would be worth it.  We arrived at Toula and were seated right beside a not terribly exciting view of an old, brutalist cement condo building, which again we thought would be fine since the restaurant revolves and soon we'd be facing the lake or other more attractive parts of the city.  Nope.  Not revolving.  Hasn't in years. Brutalist cement condo views are all the rage now apparently.  Welcome to the big city Mom & Dad.  Hope you enjoy our finest views.    Fine.  We know the food will be great.  Bring on the turkey.  Nope.  Not turkey. Not stuffing. No cranberry sauce. Not even mashed potatoes. No Thanksgiving menu to be found....in a hotel restaurant.  Surprised, and disappointed, the blame is my own.  Note to self, call ahead to confirm things for special occasions.  So, we find things on the menu that we thought we'd like.  The sad truth is, even that too, priced as it was for fine dining, was anything but.  We found our food cold and flavourless.  Perhaps they gave the head chef the night off as well. Good for them if they did.  Too bad for us.  Well, we had wine, and we toasted each other and decided to make the very best we could of this night because that is what it was about.    But wine has a way of travelling through you, so eventually, dad, unfortunately very frail, needed to use the facilities.  When he asked someone where they were, they pointed him to a stairwell he could take to a restroom on a lower floor.  He stressed that he was fairly disabled and asked if there was not a restroom on the main floor he could use. No, no restroom. Go downstairs sir. The restroom is downstairs.  I would have held it and stewed in anger myself.  Not my dad. Fortunately, he had the wisdom to approach another staff member who was kind enough to escort him to a staff restroom on the main level (i believe in the kitchen), but beggars can't be choosers.  I was just glad that he finally found an appropriate option.  I won't even get into the size of the bill considering what we had, but none of us felt the value was there. Weren't we thrilled that we paid $25 to park there to enjoy this night?  Whatever charm Toula held for us in the past, it is sadly not ever going to be part of our future.  Good luck to you if you go.  Ask for the lake view. You'll get it all night."}
{"text":"I came to Toula with a friend and the service here was wonderful! Our server was very kind and pleasant; he kept coming back to make sure we were okay. He made conversation with us, telling us stories and such.  The ambiance was nice! The food, however, could be a little better. Overall, I would definitely come here again !"}
{"text":"Horrible dining experience. Went once for Winterlicious and another time for the regular menu.  Big mistake.  For Winterlicious, the food is cold and the plates are all premade that they form hard crusts on the outside (for example on the risotto).  They also have this weird and disgusting practice of clearing used plates and storing them at the back of the dining room seating benches (see picture).  Do no waste ur money on this place when there are so many other options in Toronto."}
{"text":"Extremely limited menu options that are all very highly priced for what they are. We had a caprese  salad which consisted of three tomato slices and three pieces of cheese for $19. However if your looking for somewhere with a fantastic view over the lake and city this would be your place."}
{"text":"Apart from the view if you were facing the lake, nothing else was good. Food was average, service was so so, décor was bad and price was high."}
{"text":"I sold my soul going there. The head chef probably sold his soul working there too. It surely doesn't disappoint to ... disappoint.  I have been here before for summerlicious and my memory was rubber, cardboard and burning tires. This time around is not that different. The meal started with tasteless breadsticks pairs with presumably olive oil and vinegar. Not sure where they sourced the oil looking water but it was bland at best. My appetizer was a smoked salmon. Not only does it look old it taste just like supermarket smoked salmon. I ordered salmon for main. First off we are a table of 13 and a third of us ordered salmon. Every plate looks different with various sized cuts and plating. Mine looks like the server tripped on the way to my table because it is all over the place. The salmon is unsurprisingly over cooked and tasteless. Every bite is trying to suck saliva out of my tongue. The potato is dry and nothing note worthy. The dessert is alright to my surprise. It tastes like almond though I wouldn't call it gelato. However, being a restaurant that doesn't pay any attention to detail the fruit garnish and smear or chocolate came frozen. Obviously the whole plate was sitting in the freezer prior to serving.   Service was sub par as expected. Water doesn't come and the utensils are not properly cleaned. I don't even have the option of regular menu and was forced to take the summerlicious menu. Money grab ...  You'll be better off having a hot dog downstairs or get something from the food courts nearby.  You'll find higher quality food and chef there."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever; if I could gave them zero star I would.  My mom and I went for dinner and for the next 20 mins; not a single person came to our table.  I even made it a point to go to one of the waiters to ask for someone to serve us and yer no one came.  Save your money and don't bother going."}
{"text":"No matter the -licious, definitely not Delicious.  My family has consistently gone because they've always had a great dining experience and they enjoy the view. The one thing I will give credit for is Toula's extensive menu options for these events. However, I feel that because of all the choices, the quality and presentation of the food was not 100% there. In all the times I've been there (about 3-4), I've only had one good experience there - my first one.   Anyways, I had booked a dinner party of 8 for last night with family. I went to this dinner with low expectations since I've already had a negative experience previously - but I wanted to give Toula another chance to change my mind. Dinner was booked at the prime dinner hour of 7PM. Upon arrival, there were several large and small tables empty.  Our server came by and gave us all a round of water. About 15 minutes later another waiter took our order. I ordered the Beef Tenderloin for my main. Normally, for any beef the waiter should advise the table how it is cooked or ask diners individually how they like it cooked. The waiter did not. So before he left I had to ask him, well how is the beef cooked? He looked a little flustered as in \"I don't have time to answer these questions because I'm busy.\" So he very abruptly answers with \"its all medium\" and continues to take the rest of the orders. But what if i preferred the tenderloin to be thoroughly cooked? Did it matter? Because our waiter did NOT ask \"is that okay?\" Mind you, I prefer all meats to be medium rare, so I was thinking that the tenderloin will be cooked more well than I preferred. Luckily, the meat (average grade) turned out to be a bit more rare than medium.  THE FOOD & SERVICE: We were served bread as we waited for our appetizers. I ordered the lobster with the crab cake. Lobster was rubbery and tough and about the size of my index finger (small). Crab cake a bit dry as you can see the sauce that was on top of it has already soaked into the cake - meaning its been sitting there for some time. Ah, presentation you say? My cousin ordered the same thing as me and hers came out in a nicely plated long dish. Mine? Came out last and it was served in a weird pan-bowl thing that you can TELL that they ran out of serving plates so they got the next \"best\" thing. Apps were okay. Our table ordered a red wine and as we finished our apps my mother asked the bus boy that took the food away for another basket of bread. He looked a bit glazed over but said sure. Even if it wasn't his particular duty, he would have informed the correct person of this request to fulfill. But you all guessed it, we did not receive any more bread.  The Mains came out and they looked okay.  Two pieces of flat tenderloin on top of small glop of mashed potatoes and 2 measly strands of asparagus. The potatoes were cold. My sister ordered the stuffed ravioli. It was cold throughout! As we've all already dug into our meals, the waiter comes back about 15 minutes after being served to ask us if we wanted freshly ground pepper on our 3/4 finished meal. Please sir, tell me what you plan on putting pepper on? My last scoop of potatoes? You might as well have just not even asked! My boyfriend tried to look for a pepper shaker on the table but there was none. We did have, however, 2 salt shakers! During our meal, my mother asked for bread again. Another server said sure. As we ate, we waited. Mains were done and we now have received our desserts. Creme Brule is mediocre. Do not get the chocolate cake as its VERY dry. The best part of the dessert? Is that the server whom we asked for bread finally came to our table with our bread during dessert. He awkwardly looked at our table and realized we were ALREADY on dessert....with basket in hand, he just walked away and put the bread on the utensil table. Absolutely absurd. The waiter took our bottle of finished wine away and did not ask if we wanted another bottle or even coffee or tea with our dessert. NO ONE CAME BACK to ask us any of those things!!!!! I looked around the restaurant and it looked EMPTIER than when we first arrived.  The helpers seemed new, as if they were just taught how to wait a table that very morning. They looked lost and very confused as to what comes next. Very poorly done. The bill came and everything was pre-filled. A bit surprised, since if we wanted to tip them more than the 15%, we could not. My assumption is that Toula knows their service and food was total crap that night that they needed to guarantee the 15% and not be given any less.  In my opinion, Toula deserved no tip last night. Service was horrible and food was just average to poor. I would NEVER tell ANYONE to come herel.   My tip to you Toula? Cut your menu in half if you cant produce the quality and presentation of the food. Bump up the service and train your extra staff weeks/months prior ...and you will get 100% of your customers back and way less POOR to TERRIBLE reviews."}
{"text":"My first experience here was for a wedding dinner and it would've been the last if they hadn't begged us to return for another dinner on them just to make up for the first fiasco. Service was slow, wine over priced and the food was beyond salty. I mean they couldn't get anything right. Moving forward, we returned for our dinner on the house and it was just as bad. If it wasn't for the attentive waiter I wouldn't even give this place 1 star. Sure the place has a great view but c'mon if the food is sub par you will quickly forget about the view in no time. In regards to the meal, all meat dishes we ordered had to be sent back because they literally came to the table raw. All 4 came with standard veggies and not what was indicated on the menu.  I will never return here or recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Sorry but the standards here are very low. Save your money."}
{"text":"Attended new year's party at this restaurant and it was the worst dining experience ever. For the price of admission and dinner I could have been in the Caribbean for a week...instead got marginal service and steak that was lukewarm and not cooked to my liking...I asked for coffee 3 times...never got it.. Such a great way to celebrate my anniversary and new years eve at the same time... Did I mention that the bathroom is on a different floor.. using back staircase.Never again!"}
{"text":"Like others, despite the bad reviews we gave it a try.  The view is beautiful, especially at sunset, but it's not worth paying money to eat here.  We sat for a while before anyone came over and then were greeted with \"are you ready to order.\"  No greeting, no suggestions, no one asked if we wanted something to drink... the server was nice just inattentive.  But the one star is for the food, which is just not good.  Portion control and presentation were good but the food itself -- crab cakes, salmon and vegetables -- was salty and greasy.  Take the scenic elevator up and have a drink, or just take photos."}
{"text":"We got there half an hour before our resservation, the restaurant was full, but they arranged a table , and that too with the lake view. Went there for the view, but it was a cloudy winter day. Service was exceptional, food was great; however, the portions were small."}
{"text":"I am staying at the hotel so I decided to try despite average reviews.  Wait was long but finally the hostess showed up.  Be prepare for a long wait which isn't bad since the view is incredible.  I ordered the seabass.  I wish they clearly say Branzino.  It was over cooked but the vegetables was perfect.   I'll come here just for the view and the ambiance but the food isn't all that great!"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever! Deserve 0 star out of five. 11 of us went for winterlicioux last night. We were sitted at 7pm, our main dish was not even ready by 10pm. We complained to the manager, the manager offered a 50% off the entire meal and promised food will be here in exactly 15 minutes. 25 minutes later..when it finally come, the orders were all messed up, the waiters( not the one whotook our orders, that one disappeared) have no idea who ordered what, and lied to our face that is our order. When questioned why my medium rare steak is more burnt than my friend's medium well, the waiter still insist the all burnt steak is medium rare. My friend and i decided to switch, so we each get our required steak. The steak tasted awful!!! It doesnot taste any flavor, and its COLD!!!!! I think they dont know how to handle a large table, so they couldnot coordinate the timing for all main dishes to be ready at the same time.its much worse than the $15 steak in any bar. Not only it taste awful, my stomach started feeling uncomfortable right after eating. Waking up this morning, still having stomach pain. For deserts, the cheesecake is fair, quality comparable to the frozen one from supermarket. I just dont understand why my piece didnot come when everyone else is here, when it's clear they were just cutting slides from a big cheesecake.  When the bill came, it was full price with no discount at all..When my friend asked to see the manager, our waiter, who disappeared the entire night and finally showed up, said \"i cannot chase him around\". So my friend said \" oh then i will wait\", to which the waiter said bluntly \"wait and see\"...after we finally got the manager, he gave us 50% off to food only, tips are already added to the bil, and no discount for the wine/drinks...what happen to keep one's words...   I've always find yelp's review align with my personal taste, when my friend picked toula, i was hesitant after seeing a rating of two, but decided to give it a try since the birthday girl picked the place for the view. I have to say, trust yelp, dont go to toula."}
{"text":"Oh my... this place is awful for a \"high end\" restaurant... NO choice for vegetarian/vegans and all they could come up with was a bland alfredo pasta. Very unhappy birthday girl!!!!"}
{"text":"Giving this review two stars for the amazing view from our table and the tiramisu at the end, can't go wrong with dessert.   Despite being forewarned about Toula, my party of four decided to come here anyway for Winterlicious on February 6th. We arrived early for our 6pm reservation and were promptly seated; our area had a great view of the city. I have no complaints about our server as she was very timely with her service and polite. Unfortunately, we had the unpleasant presence of another server who had terrible hygiene (body odour) taking our plates from the table. I do apologize for mentioning this, but I feel it is important to have proper hygiene to be working for a highend restaurant.   The choice of food wasn't the greatest. I played it safe by choosing the beef fillet, medium rare, although I've had better (I.e. The Keg). My partner's lamb pasta was not appetizing at all, with expectations that there would be more lamb meat. He wasn't even offered for more cheese on top.   Let me talk about the bathrooms; they're crappy. Aesthetically. You'd think for an upscale place like Toula, every other area would flow; the bathrooms are so outdated and just not something you'd expect for Toula. The malls have prettier bathrooms!   After getting a few group photos taken by someone from management, she had asked us to leave our table for other guests since we were done paying. Um, we were gonna leave after the photos but there was no need to say it to our faces. Rude.   Overall, the $35 plus $11 martini was not worth the trip and $20 parking for Toula. Save your time and money and spend it elsewhere. We left Toula still unsatisfied and decided to take our rather empty bellies to your local Wild Wing! We really went ham on those wings!   I would not come back here unless someone paid me to or pays for my tab.   At least our photos turned out amazing!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the bathroom! Should have been our first clue to leave!!  But we didn't read between the lines.  Service was not worthy of a tip! We asked for bread much later received why I assume is day old.  Food was less than stellar.  Lobster salad was over cooked and small for $35. mushroom soup looked and tasted like split pea but we were assured it was mushrooms.  Scallops risotto was bland and fishy.  Not worthy of being associated with the Westin!"}
{"text":"I went to Toula for Summerlicious on July 11. The food was pretty good although the main courses were pretty small (my friend ordered the fish dish and the vegetable part of her meal consisted of 1 asparagus on her plate). The tip was already added automatically which I didn't like because we were not told about this (and were not a big group so not sure why they added it automatically) and also because our service was pretty bad. Our server Rony was very inattentive. He didn't come come to our table very often during our meal to check on us and at the end of our meal disappeared for about 30 minutes or so. We were waiting to get our bill for a very long time and then when we finally asked another staff member for the bill he reappeared and gave us our bills but then took his sweet time bringing the bank machine to our table. At the beginning of the meal he did not specify that the water we were being poured was bottled so I was very surprised to see a charge for water on my bill (in addition to the auto grat) as we were poured water from pitchers (which I assumed was tap water). The icing on the cake was when he made sure to tell us his name and that we should leave him a review on Trip Advisor. I didn't appreciate that at all. The food was pretty good and the view was fantastic but I probably would never come back as the service was seriously lacking."}
{"text":"We received very attentive service, but the restaurant was completely dead. Also, the young female bartender was decked out in a club dress. I will give her the benefit of the doubt, maybe she forgot her pants at home.   Food was alright, nothing too spectacular. Six people, main dishes and a couple of drinks was around $300."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a birthday.  Service was (significantly) less than stellar.  Not only did it take forever to get anything, our waiter didn't know anything about the menu or cocktails.  The food was just okay, but overpriced for what you're getting.  I couldn't get past the bad service and had a hard time enjoying my time there.  The concept of eating way up high, especially near the water, is cool.  At night you don't really see much except for some lights from the planes coming into or leaving the island.  If you're going for the view, I would recommend just going up to have a look, but not staying for dinner.    Nothing we ordered was complicated, there were only 6 in our party and the restaurant was not very busy.  I can't come up with any excuses for the bad service."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. Went for Summerlicious menu for lunch.  Arrived at noon, was informed the only entree, the salmon, was not available today and was replaced by the Cornish game hen. Salmon is pretty universal but game hen is a gamey meat.   40 minutes to get our appetizers.  Another 20 to get our entrees.  Only 10 minutes wait for dessert.   Service was slow, many times we emptied our glasses with no refill for 10+ minutes. Oddly there seemed to be a good amount of staff, but our server just disappeared for long stretches of time.   The salad \"estivio\" was just chopped lettuce with a bit olive oil and some ricotta. Completely bland and tasteless. Smoked salmon was ok.   The game hens were well cooked well but the three people who ordered it did comment there was quite an odour and it was quite gamey.  The ricotta pasta was initially quite good but the bottom layer was pure oil and butter. See the photo. I couldn't finish as we so oily. The children's chicken fingers were quite tasty. Everyone agreed it was the best thing at the table.   Desserts must have been good as they were complete gone by the time I got back from a phone call.   Overall took almost two hours to have a very basic lunch.   Add in the $4 watered down soda and would not return."}
{"text":"Steak was very good. Pasta was horrible. Considering the fact it's an Italian place, they absolutely CAN NOT cook pasta! That's disappointing. Service wasn't the best either. Waiter sucked and didn't do anything. Bus boys did all the work,including talking to us and explaining the food."}
{"text":"Thank You Toula! For making my special one's evening possible!   Took my girlfriend here for her birthday Toula was especially helpful in every aspect to make my evening plans possible they allowed me to reserve the best spot in the restaurant with the view of the CN Tower. Which she loves so much and also Toula helped me arrange flowers delivery and ensure it was waiting at the table once we arrived. Just a little FYI the flowers I got were pink peonies from Israel! Her favorite flowers.  The waiter service was exquisite clear fully explaining the choices we've had for the evenings courses. The evening was perfect just the way I planned it!   The food was great as I started with the antipasto and followed by a lobster pasta.  Will return back one day!"}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before booking.  I went with a friend for her birthday and the restaurant was running it's Winterlicious promotion like many other restaurants in the city.    When we arrived for our 6pm reservation, I had the distinct feeling they were being overwhelmed or was about to be as the hostesses seemed to be rushing about.  The restaurant was relatively empty but they seated everyone in the same section, so it was quite packed in our little section.  Once we were seated.  we waited about 10 minutes before the waiter came by to take our drink order and fill our water glasses.  15 minutes later, he came back with the drinks and took our dinner order.  The presentation of the food was fantastic, however both appetizers and mains when they did arrive were warm, as opposed to being hot.  Seemed like it sat for a while before being picked up and brought to our table.  I found the seafood in my pasta over cooked and the pasta sauce lacked any flavour.  The scallops were rubbery and the mussels were shriveled up.  However, my friend did enjoy her branzino.  After dinner, we ordered coffees to go with our desserts and again had to wait for the desserts.  My friend mentioned to the waiter she wanted to her dessert as her coffee was getting cold and wanted her water glass refilled.  The waiter was quite rude and said her water glass was still half full.  It could have been a nice evening, but 2 hours for mediocre service just doesn't make the cut.  There are much better places to spend your restaurant dollar.  This is the last time we will be dining at this establishment."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious with some Family. We all enjoyed our meals from start to finish. The dining room was elegant and sets the tone for the evening. We had a city view, so it was beautiful at night. I want to go in the summer and get a harbor view next time We chose Toula that night because for a winterlicious menu, there was variety which is good for picky eaters. Each couple's total bill was about $70.   Honestly, winterlicious and summerlicious are great opportunities to experience restaurants you wouldn't other wise visit. I'm looking forward to summerlicious and its not until July!   Definitely on my list of restaurants to try again."}
{"text":"The meal here was great, the ravioli was the best I've had in years and I travel frequently. The Caprese salad was good, a little heavy on the balsamic, and the tomatoes were not well ripened. A very small list of draft beer, only 1, but it is an Italian restaurant and the wine list was extensive.   My experience was dampened by the hustle put on by the maitre d'. We arrived for an 8:30pm reservation on a Sunday, but found out there were three customers in the restaurant. The maitre d' seated us and then gave us a spiel that there had been an unfortunate incident in the kitchen and the grill was out of use and only pasta and salads were left. Not wanting to look for a restaurant at this time, we went ahead. A short while later, several groups showed up, without reservations and were seated. Some of those groups managed to get grilled meals. It dawned on us that they were trying to get us to leave. To say that his spoiled a good meal would be an understatement."}
{"text":"enjoy the view  :Harbourfront:  Last night I joined my friend Cracker and her crew at Toula  It really has a spectacular view. From my seat I had a clear unobstructed view of the CN Tower and the surrounding concrete jungle. The view more than made up for the tired décor. If you liked it, I reckon your favourite colour is boring?  Service was bueno.  Toula has by far one of the largest Winterlicious menus I've ever seen. I ate three bread rolls while reviewing the menu. It's really detailed and there are typos. (Pause). Anyway, every dish on their menu sounds so intricate, but after having a day or two to contemplate, I would say that it didn't translate as such. The dishes had good flavours but overall, uninspired.  The five of us \"tried\" to cover the menu, but sometimes when you know what you want, you just don't want anything else. Let us break it down for you:   The best appetizer of the three that graced our table was Cracker's: \"Center Cut, Pan Seared Chilean Sea Bass Medallion On San Gimigiano Carnaroli Saffron Risotto Cake Finished With A Citrus Bur Blanc Sauce\"  I don't know about the bur blanc whatchamacallit - I'm sure it did something - but the bass and the risotto cake alone were so good.  The second best was the \"Sautéed Portabella And Shitake Mushrooms Tower Over A Fresh Polenta Cake Finished With A Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese Fondue\".  Sidebar: Fondue is usually fun-do, but there was no fun to be had here.  There was neither a communal pot nor any dipping going on.  The dish was still good.  My appetizer, of course, wasn't, because I have a tendency to order wrong.  I had the \"Fresh Jumbo Black Tiger Shrimp Tuscan Tempura On A Bed Baby Aromatic Arugula, Drizzled With 20 Year Old Balsamic Reduction\".  I think I always order shrimp because I'm mildly allergic. It makes me feel badass to order something I know I'm not supposed to eat.  Apart from the shrimp being big and fatty, I wasn't impressed.   Everyone but Venus ordered the tenderloin. Being a meat and potatoes kind of girl it was a no brainer for me, and then I saw the truffle mashed potatoes part and lost interest in everything else.  Let me start with what Venus ordered, because I was waiting with anticipation. It was \"special imported paccheri pasta\" with PEI lobster. Special import = Big expectations.  The dish arrived and Venus said it best, \"ohhhhh, special imported pasta means giant rigatoni\".   The rest of us had \"Certified AAA Beef Tenderloin Filet Grilled to Perfection With a Medley of Sautéed Wild Mushrooms In An Amarone Red Wine Reduction\"  Grilled to Perfection is incorrect; then again no one sent theirs back.   The \"Black Truffle Fontina Cheese Mashed Potatoes\" were really, really good.   Dessert was relatively mediocre.  Most of us ate, just to eat.  All in all, it was still a good meal, because it was $35.   I left content, but underwhelmed. Toula simply didn't do enough to sway me to return post-Winterlicious. So I suppose they technically failed, because after all isn't the point of Winterlicious to wow me so that I might think of you again in the future?   Toula who?"}
{"text":"No. Just don't go.   Food: not good, no flavour, over priced. No.   Service: slow. Everyone seemed new the night I went. But they were very friendly and pretty.   Drinks: the only reason for the two stars.  View: great."}
{"text":"After seeing the initial rating of this place is 2. I came w expectations of it being one of thoSe swanky restaurant bars that over charges you for minimal food. My impression was very wrong. We did to on a rainy night, but you would have an amazing view of the lake from above. It kind of has the same vibe as the cn tower revolving restaurant that way. What I was especially pleased by was how fair the portions  were considering summerlicoous when at most places they tend to be stingy with how much  food you get per plate. For a busy night, we had great service who came around frequently to ask how we were doing, and when he saw that one dessert's majority wasn't eaten he offered to exchange it for my friend to one she'd thinks she would like better. The pork tenderloin I had was cooked perfectly medium rare and had lovely garnishes to go along side of it. The wine we had wasn't out of this world amazing but it was pretty average to pair with each of our dishes. Don't listen to some of the reviews of this place.. It's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I went there for Summerlicious last year and the food was definitely not too great.  It didn't taste good at all.  I think I had seafood and my ex had steak... The only pro was the amazing view!  I would suggest it for a drink and the great view!  Other then that, I would recommend going somewhere tastier.  =))"}
{"text":"OH MY, I really, really wish I read the reviews first before my visit to Toula.  We read the summerlicious menu and it sounded great- but it was honestly one of the worst meals we've ever had.  Honestly, save your money and by street meat (hot dog cart), the hot dog will guaranteed be better!!!   Apps- Husband order Cheese & Salami Platter -Amazing (why they get the .5 star). And only because they didn't have COOK it as it was imported.  I ordered the swordfish raw over salad- not good- very plain. Main- Husband ordered beef tenderloin cooked to perfect but a little cool and the peas sauce it was over had a light layer of dry crust- proving it to have been sitting around for a while.  I order the gnocchi- NO WAY That was fresh!!!!  Worse then frozen gnocchi.  Sandy, starchy flavorless mess.  I for the first time sent a plate back- never done that before. They brought the lobster pasta instead.  Dry & hard previously freezer burnt lobster overcooked.  But I forced it down to be polite.  Neither dishes were flavourful or seasoned.  We don't cook with salt and I actually added some to my pasta to try and give it some flavour. Dessert- husband ordered the cappacino shot over icecream- I thought it was nice, husband thought it was too strong.  I had the white and brown half frozen mouse.  Honestly looked like dog crap on a plate the way they served it.  I thought it was joke but it wasn't.  I will never ever ever go back. Ambiance- def outdated!  Nice view. Service- was great until the restaurant picked up and then there was no service. Washrooms- hidden on another level Price- a joke, way overpriced for frozen microwaved food.  BtW, there is NO DEBIT!!!  Credit card or cash only.  Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"I could tell when we arrived that this wasn't going to be a good experience. We showed up on time for our reservation to find a several people waiting for tables. The hostess took a while to even acknowledge us, and then told us to join the queue. Shortly after another hostess comes by and yells \"which of these people is the next deuce?\". None of us deuces knew. That's not our job. The other hostess didn't answer, which prompted her to yell even louder and angrier \"who is the next deuce?\". In the end, with a reservation we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. And there were plenty of empty seats. I suppose we just have different ideas of what a reservation means.  We ordered two of the smallest $12 glasses of wine I've ever seen. 3 oz, maybe 4 oz is too stingy for a place like this. I had the Caprese salad to start, which was delicious and fresh. My date enjoyed her smoked salmon as well. For my main, I had a lobster pasta that included the smallest lobster tail I've ever seen (about 5 cm long, 1.5 cm wide). They must specially pick these lobsters as babies to rip off unsuspecting diners. The pasta itself was bland and unsubstantial. For desert I had the Tiramisu. It was good, but nothing special.  While we were eating dessert the waiter brought our bill, without being ask. Yes, while were still eating. It's nice to see that enjoyed having us as much as we enjoyed being there."}
{"text":"Hi, and this was my 1st day and, time at Toula-I enjoyed the atmosphere and, the people. Great restaurant and, I do not know who went at Winterlicious but the food is great so I do not know the person who did that review as they are obviously used to a different kind of dining experience in Toronto.  I really do not know why a diner would comment about the poor quality of the food- I have dined here and, it is fantastic.  Thanks to all for my 1st day. J.P."}
{"text":"Went there for Summerlicious for dinner. View was great, we didn't get the best seats but we can still see a lot of the lake. Food was worth four stars for Summerlicious price but I guess I'd expect more if I am paying the regular price.  Desserts were great. Like their Creme brulee a lot."}
{"text":"Service here is absolutely fantastic! That's probably the most memorable part of the experience.  The food is nothing great for the price they charge. But the restaurant is cool because you can look out at the water/city.  The portions are small which I guess is kind of expected for the place, and the presentation was nice. I started with the Mixed Organic Greens (with a Citrus Yogurt Dressing, Topped with Roquefort Cheese and Toasted Walnuts).  This was actually really good!  My main was a Black Angus Fillet.  It came with a tiny amount of veg on the side and was a more of a medium rather than medium rare that i asked for.  Dessert i had some sort of fruit tart  that was less than impressive, but the ice cream was a nice touch.  I was still hungry when I left, but yeah I'm a big eater."}
{"text":"We dined here using a Groupon for a four-course dinner for our family.  $299 for eight people, regular price apparently clocking in at $784.  For less than $40 pp (not including taxes and gratuities yet), what an AMAZING deal!  I was thoroughly impressed with the top-notch quality, presentation and taste of every single course.  My insalata di mare was a light starter with very fresh grilled calamari and shrimp.  Next was the antipasto board with a variety of sliced meats and cheese, a nice change of pace to our meal.  My entree was the grilled seafood cacciucco, a tomato-based broth with tons of tiger shrimps, scallops, calamari, mussels, clams and saltwater fish.  This was truly an impressive entree - a very hearty portion that was as delicious as it looked!  I was honestly floored with this dish.  Dessert was the Toula tiramisu, an amazingly sweet way to top off the meal.    What a fantastic meal!  It's been a while since I've had such a gloriously impressive meal.  Definitely was impressed with everything...and of course, the panoramic view and romantic candlelit ambiance was a huge draw as well!  Only negative angle to point out is the very costly drinks, which is pretty much expected for this type of establishment.  $7.5/bottle of distilled water...and main annoyance is that our server kept automatically topping off our water glasses, obviously to max out the number of water bottles we'd order.  $15 glasses of wine are also quite pricey.  Tip would be to keep your drinks in check!  Anyway, I'll still look out for another special opportunity to revisit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went during Winterlicious for a Saturday lunch for a table of 5. For $23, I had the Toula amore salad, salmon, and gelato.  --PROS-- The view! Can see Dash 8s and 172s land at CYTZ.  And ships at the ferry harbour.  The decor of the place was nice. As expected of a restaurant by the harbour. Place was spacious and not crowded like my experience at another Winterlicious restaurant.  Portions of the food were filling enough given the price. Honestly a first given all my 'licious experience.  --MEH-- Taste of the food was good, but nothing to get too excited about. I'm assuming most of the revenue goes to the rent of the place instead of the food. Owell, at least my tummy was satisfied.  HOT! No idea why, but they seemed to have set the heat at like 25C. That and the sun and amount of people meant I had to strip down to my t-shirt after the salad.  The service itself was good, but finding someone to serve can be a problem.  --CONS-- Because we were hot, I needed cold water. They seemed to be understaffed whenever we needed water.  Getting the bill took awhile too. Not too long where we're annoyed yet, but long enough where we're left wondering why it's taking so long.  ==OVERALL== Overall, I'm fairly satisfied with my experience here. I'd say Toula is more for the view rather than the food. The service I had was acceptable, not outstanding, but acceptable.  For $23 Winterlicious lunch, I'd go again if I'm with friends that havent been. Else, I'd prefer trying a different restaurant. But I'd definitely prefer Toula over my other recent Winterlicious experience."}
{"text":"I was at this restaurant in early October of this year to celebrate my bachelorette party. When we got to the restaurant at 7pm (our reservation time) we waited about a full hour and a half to get our meal. When I got my meal, I noticed that the rice was undercooked. Actually it was dry and crunchy in my mouth. I called the waiter over to complain, but instead of apologizing and offering me something else, he began to argue with me, trying to explain that the rice is supposed to be that way. Anyway, he didn't back out of the argument. I told him I will not pay for the food and he just walked away. My friend then went over to speak to him and to tell him how rude he was and that she wanted to speak to the manager. Turned out that HE WAS the manager! Needless to say, we couldn't get an apology out of him, however he did subtract the dish off the bill, after endless arguments back and forth. Some people never learn how to treat their customers. Very bad service, indeed. Will not return."}
{"text":"This resto is on a top floor of the Westin Harbor Castle.  Take an elevator up and you're greeted and seated. I came here for a date in 2011 I believe, summer time.   The views are great, but I almost suggest getting a city view, because Lake Ontario is in ruins and then there are patches of industrial areas within this \"view\"...  The food is okay. Small portions. It is the idential to the fare you would get at CN tower...butternut squash soup, ...ravioli..etc..just boring. This may have changed though, as I was there years ago.  Prices were a bit on the higher end, but all in all, a good resto for a date. You get the hotel residents and vacationers with kids, so its not really exclusive, it is a fun summer time spot, then to head to the lake after, or islands or a bar."}
{"text":"I went here for summerlicious, and it was a real steal, $20 for lunch there. The view was spectacular, but that is because I made sure it would be a sunny day today :D And it was worth it! The blind kept closing by itself, so they seated us in a different area. The food was pretty good, the bass filet was well done and the bread they served was fresh, fluffy and delicious.  We went after lunch on a Friday, so while it was packed at first all of the lunch-goers eventually left, leaving it quiet and tranquil. We were served by an awesome waiter with a great attitude, and the tiramisu was a definitely nice, coffee-soaked touch. I don't think I would come here if it wasn't for Summerlicious, but the view was amazing and the food was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Not worth even 1star. Please don't waste your money coming to this place. Most lousy food I ever had. Minimal options for vegetarians. And whatever we ordered, there was no taste no flavour and each dish cost avg 30 plus dollars. First off, the serving size was very small and on top of that the taste was so bad it felt like a 4 yr old put it together.   All I could taste was mild tomatoish taste and that's it. Pineapple juice had a tin can taste and Alfredo pasta was missing sauce."}
{"text":"Despite the sub-par reviews we've read on Yelp, my wife and I decided to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  So I made reservations for winterlicious dinner at Toula. This is how our evening played out. Took the scenic elevator up and was able to enjoy the beautiful city lights. Arrived close to 6pm on a Sunday and noticed it was quite empty, but for some reason they had difficulty finding us a table for 4... We were politely told to wait while the 2 hostesses scrambled for 10 minutes to come up with the ingenious plan of placing 2 round tables together to form a table of 4.   The restaurant appeared to be overstaffed with many workers wandering aimlessly back and forth making eye contact with their hands because God forbid they actually look at the patrons to see if they have been attended to. We waited 15 minutes before we got our bread, another 10 minutes before someone noticed we didn't get our water yet and finally after 30 minutes of being seated our waitress acknowledge our existence. She apologized several times as she was not informed that she was suppose to wait tables on our side of the restaurant. Nothing against our waitress, she was pleasant and tried her best to serve in this disorganized and poorly managed restaurant.  Our highlight of the night was the bread. The bread was warm, soft and kept our stomachs from devouring itself as we wait to place our orders. Everything went downhill after that warm fluffy bread. The food was mediocre at best. My entree, the lamb pasta, came with an extra ingredient... a strand of curly hair... Chef special i guess... Not only was the pasta not very tasty, that piece of hair just put me off for the rest of the evening. Our waitress was busy serving other tables so I had to tell the waitstaff that cleared our table what I had found in my dish. His response was just an \"oh...\" no apology no nothing. I proceeded to tell him to take it back as I'm too put off to eat another bite. About 15 minutes passed before our waitress learnt about the hair in the food and came by to apologize and advised us the manager will be with us shortly.  It wasn't until another 15 minutes until the manager confusingly found his way to our table. Contrary to what appeared to be an overstaffed restaurant, the manager informed us 2 employees had called in sick, which resulted in the backlog and him serving tables as well. He reassured us that the kitchen staff all wear hair nets and etc, he apologized and offered me another dish which I declined. He then proceed to take my meal off the tab and give us a 15% off the entire bill which I believe was fair. It's just getting the bill took another 20 minutes which is beyond ridiculous.  Customer service is definitely not a priority in this restaurant. We've been to CN Tower 360 (loved it!) which prior to our experience at Toula, would perceive them to be on a similar level of restaurants but boy were we fooled.   Granted it wasn't a winterlicious special at 360 but isn't the purpose of winterlicious to entice potential patrons for another future visit? Not scare them off with mediocre food and extremely slow service?  All in all, this horrible dining experience could have been immensely improved had the staff been properly trained to provide better customer service. I get that shit happens, stuff falls into food even when precautions are taken but don't leave your guests hanging like it's not a big deal."}
{"text":"Tasteless and overpriced! View is great but with a hefty price to pay for the disappointing food plus parking cost! Service was super slow and overall a bad experience"}
{"text":"This restaurant is an utter disappointment. I decided to give them a chance despite the plethora of negative reviews and it was a total regret. I went for their Winterlicious dinner with a couple friends. Our reservation was for 5pm, the first reservation slot mind you. This did NOT change the outcome of the terrible food. The only good thing about this restaurant is the view. Very nice.   Now, the food?? Completely disgusting. Everything, with the exception of the Cannolata Siciliana, tasted like it came from a can or a hospital. Bland was not the word. To make matters worse, I think they gave me the tiniest lobster tail I have ever seen in my life. I've had crawfish that were bigger than it. FURTHERMORE, it had a mushy, flaky texture like fish which was very odd. I was scared to eat it and had to order another one. Which wasn't much better. At that point I was over it. My friend's steak which she ordered as medium, came out pretty much well done.   Now on to service. We had a \"new\" server. No excuse in my book. We had a party of 3, the table was only set for 2. We had no salt and pepper shaker (which we CLEARLY needed) on the table but all the other tables did. They seated us close to a section where they kept things they may have to bring to the table every so often (utensils, plates, etc.) and one of the servers kept reaching over me to get things. Totally unacceptable! My friends also had to wait 20 mins for hot water and when they finally brought it, it was yellow. They claimed it was the cup, but when we asked them to bring some different water, it miraculously became clear. Well whaddya know??   All in all, this place would never see my face OR my coins ever again!"}
{"text":"**Toula, you're getting a one star because of your food.  I would give you none if I could**  I made a reservation for 8 girls for my friend's bachelorette dinner.  Told the hostess to write a specific message on the dessert for my friend, and she said she'll get it done.    When we got to the restaurant, I double checked with the hostess (she was very nice) about the message on the dessert, she said it's in the computer and not to worry about it.  So we proceed to the dining table.  Me and another girl ordered their risotto, and after a 30 mins wait, the food finally arrived.  And our risotto turns out to be under cooked (the rice were still crunchy), so we told our server to kindly bring us a cooked one.  He first raised his eye brows, then asked if we know \"Al dente\" means, and if we know that risotto are suppose to be \"Al dente\" (never in a million years would I expect to be question by a server about this, especially not in a restaurant on the top floor of Westin Harbour hotel ).  I told him I've had over hundreds of risottos in my life, so I know what I'm eating (I happen to be a big risotto fan).  He finally took the risotto and started mumbling something while he was walking away.    Me and my friends didn't want to make a big scene about this, cause we wanted our friend to have a good time that evening, so we just bite our tongue and waited patiently for another 20 mins before the risotto was cooked properly and brought back to us (the risotto was okay).  Then our server was no where to be found for the next 20 mins, didn't come and refill any of our drinks at all.    So dessert time came, my friend (the bride to be) ordered a molten lava cake and I tried to remind the server about the specific message.  And before I could finish my  sentence, he  raised his eye brows, gave me the WTF look and said \" oh........of course I know\".  20 mins later, he came out with the dessert, then he started singing \"happy birthday to you...happy birthday to you\".  Everyone at the table jaw dropped!  We told him from the beginning that this is a bachelorette party and the message was suppose to be \"bachelorette on the loose\".  So he managed to mess the dessert part up too.  His reply to this was \"oh..someone else ordered the molten cake right, they can have the happy birthday one instead\".  5 second later, another server brought out the dessert with the correct message, so obviously our server was trying to be a smart @$$ again.    Anyways, so I thought to myself, \"it's okay, dinner is going to be over soon, I'm just going to enjoy my dessert\".  Turns out my molten lava cake was rock solid, it was more like a brownie.  I didn't even bother asking the server to bring it back, I fear he might as me \"do you know what a lava cake is suppose to be\".     We proceed to ask for the bill, and we wanted separate bills.  He goes \"oh.....I have to charge you 18% for gratuity, and I don't know how to do that if you want separate bills. \"  (not sure if this is the first time they're having a group of 8 in their entire restaurant history for them to not know how to do it).  Anyways, I told him that's ridiculous, and he just kept on repeating how we'll still need to pay him 18% even if we get our separate bills.  At that point in time, my EQ was running really low, so I told him I don't give a crap about his gratuity, I've never pay less than 20% anyways and please do make this first time for me.  I told him I'll give him that 18% and just bring us the separate bills.  He walked away without saying a word.  So me and the girls decide to just do all the calculations by ourselves.  Then after we're done, we waited around for another 15 mins before he came back with the separate bills with the 18% gratuity added it.  I was paying with credit card, so I left my card there and went to the washroom, while he grab the machine.  When I came back, and was ready to fill out the numbers, I notice that he filled out his own tip in, and the total.  He was so worry that he wouldn't get his full 18% gratuity that he filled it all out .  I thought to myself, he might as well forge my signature.   Me and my friends still bite our tongue, again, because we want to make sure the bride to be will have a good time.    On our way out, that server did not say thank you or bye to us.  First thing he did was rush over to double check and make sure he got his full gratuity.     So my conclusion is, if I'm expecting service like this, I'll go to a cheap Chinese restaurant in china town.  I don't need to deal with this BS when at a restaurant at a reputable hotel.  This is a complete disgrace for the hotel and the restaurant owner and the chef.  I'll never come back again!"}
{"text":"What an absolutely horrible restaurant.  The food was ok, but the service absolutely sucked.  Paid over one hundred bucks for drinks and dinner and got service worthy of Denny's.  I will not be back.  And I encourage other guest of the Westin to not patronize this disaster of a restaurant."}
{"text":"We made a summerlicous reservation for 8 people for 7:30. Our table wasn't ready until 8:10.  It was ridiculous. The service was not that great. Food was okay. nothing special. The only thing that I enjoy was the scenery. For the price, I would not go back to this place"}
{"text":"The service was excellent.  It was a cold and snow stormy day but it was also my husband's birthday so we had to make it out to the restaurant to celebrate.  There was no one there besides maybe 2 other couples.  The waiter sat us down and immediately asked us if we wanted hot soup before we ordered anything else. He gave us the wine menu but was not pushy about it at all.  We had also forgotten to order wine because we were so hungry, the waiter brought us prosecco anyway since we were such troopers in the cold.    He kept asking if we would like anything else, and after our meals offered to take our pictures and have a walk around the 360 restaurant to take in the view before closing.  At this time he found out it was my husband's birthday and gave us another glass of prosecco on the house.  He was truly a warm and kind person and not at all judgy for the type of upscale restaurant that it is.   He made us feel welcome and comfortable right off the bat."}
{"text":"should have read the yelps before going. VERY underwhelming experience. waiter/maitre'd was annoying. kept hurrying us along and topping off our wine suggesting it was time to go. a wasted $150 in my opinion. my date would agree. will NEVER return."}
{"text":"I Went to Toula for winterlicious lunch with coworkers. Seriously, if you are going for the food , dont. This restaurant is one of the worst restaurants I have been to in Toronto. I wouldn't have their food even if its free. I didn't went in with high expectations, but for a restaurant in this location and environment, its a new low. Lobster soup has no lobster, I suspect its straight from Campbell's. Smoke salmon just presented like what you get from supermarket. Just a few pieces of smoked salmon laying on top of a bed of salad green with mayo. Come on , Even Ikea has lemon wedges on the side. Now the Cornish chicken and mash potato. The hen is very dry and has no taste to it. No sauce or what so ever. If you want a view, go to Canoe. At least Canoe has standards. This one is just dont even, I cant even. I really think that they bought everything straight from metro then put them on plates."}
{"text":"I saw the other two star ratings and came anyway out of sheer laziness. I would usually run, not walk away from a 2-rated restaurant, but I'm at a conference and too tired to do better.   I mean I *am* on the 38th floor of the Westin. It should be pretty decent, right? The view is pretty and the bartender was great. The drinks are pretty good, but then there's the food. It leaves a lot to be desired. I ordered seafood linguine, which is as basic as it gets. They missed the mark big time. Now I'm stuck with a $40 meal. Meh."}
{"text":"I have to say, Yelp reviews are pretty accurate about this place.  Here's what I thought.  The view in the restaurant and location is what's great about this place.  Food was average.  This is what bright their ratings down.  We went for lunch and they charged us the dinner menu prices which was more expensive.  They also claimed that their credit card machine was out of service.  So we had to pay cash and when we did, they rounded it up to the nearest dollar in their favor."}
{"text":"Wow. I didn't think TOULA would be so disgusting. Service was horrible. Food was TERRIBLE and service was even worse!  Arrived and was treated curtly by the host. No service for 15 minutes, I went to grab the water pitcher myself and poured my friend and I water. Appetizers came. Smoked salmon tasted like it was out of the package and my friends scallops were overcooked and slimey. Main course came. Friend got chicken, which was tasteless and dry. My order was wrong, I ordered steak and received a salmon. Steak came 10 minutes later.. it was slightly burnt.  The mashed potatoes tasted like 50 cents from a box and the vegetables I couldn't even touch.  Dessert was the only decent part tasted like the boxes of cheesecake you buy at a supermarket.  I do not know what witchcraft they're using to stay afloat.   Only ever come here for the view and perhaps some alcohol to tolerate being in this crappy place wow.  Thought to myself I'd rather have a cheeseburger from McDonalds than be sitting on those plastic chairs at Toula. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Food was sub par for the price. Decor was outdated and gratuity included on a bill more than 100$ for 2 summerlicious deals. One saving grace is the view.....but windows were dirty"}
{"text":"a few quick notes off my longer review: \"A simple yet significant detail: bread. For a restaurant considered to be in a $$$$ category, having stale bread is inexcusable.\" \"Our Toula salad was not that great to be honest. It missed some vinaigrette or a sauce dressing - perhaps the lemon that the description promised. There was a bitter taste carried in by endive. The palm harts were great though and Emmental cheese gave the plate a nice finish. There was also corn and avocado to add some sweet, smoothness. I would not call this a signature dish, unless it get that hint of something exciting.\" \"The Tagliolini Con Salsa Di Astice lobster plate was one of the more expensive items on the menu. It was topped off by a sizable chunk of lobster and tastefully arranged on the plate. We paired it with a glass of Sangiovese which turned out to be a good combination. The dish was heavy and smooth, but nothing exciting. Cannot say it was worth the money, but the presence of lobster definitely upped the price tag on it.  The other main dish was Risotto \"CasaNova\". Ma Cheri definitely enjoyed it although I would have found it a bit on a plain side. It was light and undercooked for al dente. Chardonnay we got was not a really good match of the dish - a lighter red might have been a better choice. Overall, this risotto was a safe choice. It promised black truffle, rosemary and provolone - all present.\"  This is just a bite of our full review.."}
{"text":"Went there for Summerlicious during lunch time on a weekend - food was great - view was amazing - service was great too - there weren't too many people at the time we went would certainly go back there... this place is good for special occasions..."}
{"text":"We had Winterlicious reservations for 3 for 6:30. One of us arrived first and was seated immediately, but they didn't ask if she wanted anything while she was waiting. Ten minutes later the second person in our party arrived, and then they took the drink order. The drinks came shortly after. When the last person in our party arrived we ordered appetizers, but it took them over an hour to get them to us. The manager came by to placate us, but didn't  offer us any explanation for why it was taking so long other than to offer up the excuse that it was busy due to the Winterlicious rush. By 8:30 we still hadn't received our mains, and started noticing that other people who arrived after us were getting their food before us. The mains were delicious when they finally arrived and so was dessert. However they seemed so disorganized that we figured it must be their first year doing Winterlicious. Imagine our surprise when we learned they've been doing it since the beginning 10 years ago. They had an impressively large menu, but perhaps if they offered fewer items it might have been easier for them to maintain?"}
{"text":"Stay away from Toula. Lobster tasted like chicken, steak tasted like rubber, salmon was overcooked, scales were still on the seabass. Dessert tasted like it was bought from nofrills.  3 stats for service, -10 for the food. Left Toula and had to go to McDonald's to refresh my palette   Stay away because you will regret the second you put their food in your mouth. Elevators seems like they're about to break down, especially the scenic elevator. Dangerous place to be.  Ps. 15% Tips are automatically added to the bill also"}
{"text":"Went there for summerlicious and was not impressed. The service was OK, food mediocre. Yet, despite this, we had a good time. Why, you ask? Location, location... You're paying for the view!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Everything about this dining experience was horrible (except for the view- although it was through a dirty window) and the person I was with. The risotto was raw and swimming in oil. The ravioli  was broken and one big blob. It looked like someone vomited on my plate.  Expensive and one of the worst meals I have ever had."}
{"text":"Really surprised about the night view and decoration I just love how they put the tables beside the window Food is okay, but would recommend their tiramisu"}
{"text":"I dined there last Wednesday night. It was a very foggy night so I didn't get the opportunity to enjoy the gorgeous view. What a disappointment as I sat next to the window.  In reviewing the menu I was surprised at the fact there was only one choice for a glass of chardonnay and it was $16. Especially when reviewing the food menu and the prices were so much more reasonable in comparison. Wine wasn't even to my likening.  I ordered a potato soup and a shrimp and pasta dish. I was pleased the chef accommodated a minor special request. However both dishes came out steaming hot. They should have waited. Both dishes were fine. When I asked for cheese I didn't get what I thought was nice fresh shredded parm but maybe it was?  Service was very very attentive. There was a bit of hiccup at the end but I found the manager and he appropriately handled it.  Overall experience was fine. I probably should have saved the money and just had room service since I was alone and food was just ok and there was no view.   Highlight I guess would be the service and would expect the view is fabulous.  If you want a nice quiet meal make sure to get seated away from loud bar."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to begin with.  This place is a SCAM. - The view: Forget about the amazing view that you see on their website, this is a FRAUD. The only decent view is the one on the lake. Otherwise you will enjoy the parkings, NOT the CN Tower or anything. - The service: Very bad, in appropriate jokes to inefficiency.  - The price: Dear Lord, this is overpriced. We took 2 salads and 2 Pepsi for 79$. Jesus, I collapsed when I saw the bill because they charged us 11$ for water. Yes, they put tap water in a glass bottle, and they charged us 11$.  - The food: I don't mind spending money on a good dinner but that was more than bad. Italian food ? Where ? Food isn't worth the price. This is a joke. - The restaurant: For that prices, they could at least renovate. And please, turn off the music."}
{"text":"I made reservations to Toula for Valentines Day dinner. The view wasnt as spectacular as I expect. It was a fixed menu that composed of 4 courses + a drink.   The service here was extremely unprofessional. The waiters weren't attentive or caring. We waited for a total of 1 1/2 hours just to get our appetizers.... and another 1/2 for our main course.. keep in mind that they would of left us hanging if we didnt complain about the service and repetively told them to check to see if the food is ready.. what kind of restaurant makes their customers have to ask to check on their food?   Anyway on top of that, they brought out the wrong appetizers. The food wasnt as appetizing as expected.. I would rather go to the keg or jack astors instead. If you guys think Chinese restaurants have bad service, wait until you experience it at Toula. It was $75/ person and the bill came up to $206 hahaha pretty outrageous. They also accidently charged us for 2 cokes.. which we didnt even order. And they automatically include a 20% tip which was $30..... they didnt even deserve $5 tbh.   Never again. This is truly a Valentines I will never forget."}
{"text":"I'm giving Toula credit for the view and because I didn't expect much.  It really needs a renovation.  They have stuff lying out all over the place.  It's overpriced, even in Canadian dollars.  I was immediately underwhelmed from the atmosphere, and really didn't want to pay the menu prices.  A server? (not sure, every time I turned around someone else was coming by, never the same person twice!) walked by with spaghetti and meatballs,a nd i thought that looked good and couldn't bee too much!  They charged me $28, the spaghetti was meh, the meatballs were dry and bland, and they put canned parmesan on it.  Wonderful view, the people are friendly if some are hard to understand, but the food is meh at best and overpriced for what it is.  Oh, and the \"house red\" was pretty atrocious even for a house wine."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend for their summerlicious menu and we were totally disappointed by their food and their service. Our waiter was unfriendly and didn't try to Talk to us at all. He was hard to find during our dinner and the food was cold when it got to our table. He gave us the bill before we got our dessert and he got our orders mixed up as well. This restaurant needs more waiters and better service. Probably never coming back."}
{"text":"Some of these reviews are a little picky.  We were greeted very warmly at the entrance to the restaurant and I requested a menu to look at. When it occurred to me that all I was in the mood for was simple spaghetti and meatball, maître d' came over and said although it's not on the menu will be glad to make it for you. My date was happy with her egg plant parmesan. However, portions were small and rather expensive. But I expect to pay a lot because your really paying for the view, the upscale elegance and the location.  The view! Of course the view is spectacular 360° of Toronto at its best. What are people talking about when they say the decor is old? It's all wood, built-in glass shelves and wine racks, absolutely beautiful, very rich.  The service was perfect!"}
{"text":"Beautiful view but food was less than desirable. I ordered the filet medium rare and it was over cooked. Lobster tail was tiny and not tasty; even the mashed potatoes were bland. Go for the view and have a drink but enjoy a meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"THE FOOD WAS SHIT!!!!!!!! HORRIBLE!!!!!! \"mushroom soup\" tasted and looked like grinded mushrooms in hot water the shrimp...omg almost threw up after spitting it out! so gross! gnocci...over cooked making it chewy cheese...didn't even taste like cheese steak...not so good and served with arugala... no potatoes or vegetables!  Since when?! Desert...come on how can you screw that up?!  Well of course they did!  the \"chocolate cake\" had no taste!  Cake from a box even has taste!  I don't understand how an expensive restaurant can serve such crappy food! oh and a beer....$9"}
{"text":"This review is for the Summerlicious experience.  This restaurant is located on the 38th floor of the Westin Harbour hotel, which would afford you wonderful views of the city. However the night we chose was all rainy and foggy so you couldn't see anything..but later in the night we did see fireworks happening so that was cool.  I had the smoked salmon as an app - it was ok..not great.  A little greasy.  My main was the pasta and lamb ragu.  It was delicious - a nice flavourful dish.  Portion size is perfect for me but I could see how it would be small for some people who have bigger appetites.  The desert I chose was the passion fruit/chocolate custard.  Based on the description of the dish I thought I was getting a custard made with passion fruit puree and some chocolate drizzled on it.  What I got was a chocolate brownie like thing with a smidge of passion fruit custard smeared underneath. It was ok but not what I thought.  Someone else ordered this as well and didn't finish is.  The server noticed she didn't like it and offered to get a different dessert for her!  He told me that a lot of people ordered this expecting something else b/c it's called a custard but it really isn't what you get.  He brought out another dessert -the apple crumple something or other and that one was yummy!  He could have just picked up the unfinished dessert and just walked away but he didn't - he made sure we were happy.  For that I have to give 5 stars for service.  For food I would give about 3.5 starts - so 4 stars overall.  I can't comment on price since the special was $35 dinner which I thought was fair.  Overall the food here is much better then the CN tower (the other equivalent restaurant with this type of setup/view of the city).  It's a great touristy spot to have a meal and a view.  I had a great time with some great service and some great friends!"}
{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant. If I could give negative ratings, I would. I had heard both good and bad things about this restaurant, so I finally decided to try it myself. I came here for summerlicious 2016. Arrived at about 7:45 and our first dish came around 8pm. The first course was scallops and smoked salmon, it was quite good so my hopes were high. The next course took over 45 mins and a conversation with the manager before it finally arrived closer to 9pm. Everything ranged from mediocre to extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Oh God, I really wish I had dived into reviews before coming over. I usually check reviews for everything but since this was a Westin, I thought I'd be safe. I thought WRONG.   The reviews are TRUE. Do not waste your money or frankly your TIME. My friends and I went out for a winterlicious dinner and received 3 courses over THREE HOURS. INSANE. We sat for a half hour before we even got our bread. Should of just gotten up and left. Our waiter was MIA for the majority of the night and also not friendly. Wait staff can really change the quality of your evening, and he frankly brought it right down.   No one was happy with their food. My girlfriend's chicken was dry and flavourless, my steak was burnt & overcooked (medium well as opposed to medium rare) and my girlfriend's ravioli, which she asked for served with butter, was served with sauce. Desserts were a miss. Bland. My salad came undressed.   I don't know who this restaurant is for, but certainly not anyone who knows food. Maybe someone whose tastebuds were burnt off in a fatal accident. Honestly please don't go. This is an embarrassment to Toronto restaurants. A $2 hot dog would have been a better decision than 40$ plates of paper mache"}
{"text":"We like to give the benefit of the doubt but the majority of the reviews here we agree with now.  We went for summerlicious and are choices were the following: Scallops - these were delicious, nothing fantastic about them, just well made  Salmon - Good not cold, typical salmon with capers and onions, nothing fancy Swordfish - was just okay, needed seasoning  Angus - ordered medium rare and received well, needed seasoning too.  Tirimisu - again just okay Tartufo - ice cream that tasted like flowers. Get it if that's your thing.   View and service was excellent. It was very loud so don't go here if you're looking for a quiet romantic dinner. Overall, the food was nothing unique and was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"We went for a winterlicious lunch here today. Between the four of us we can say we should have stayed home. I started off my meal with a caprese tomato salad. It was very bland just tomato and cheese lightly drizzled with olive oil. For my main I had ordered the Chef Signature Passatelli Dell' Artusi. I couldn't believe it was my meal when I got it, it literally looked like throw up on a plate. I tried it anyways hoping that the looks were just deceiving but the pasta was also quite horrendous. After getting it we had asked to switch my main to something else and they were very kind and quickly switched it to the Salmone Alla Fiorentina. Three of us were all now eating this main and we all had the same problem, extremely dry salmon due to over cooking it. By this point in time we had pretty much thrown in the towel with disappointment. The waiter (our third one) insisted on sending it back and getting fresh salmon so we did. It looked much better upon coming back. For dessert we had tiramisu which we thought was the best part of the meal. My aunts were drinking tea throughout our meal and during dinner had asked for more hot water. It wasn't until dessert that the \"hot water\" finally came. The waiter brought a pitcher of warm water in a plastic water jug.....which was quite strange and in the end they said no thank you as they wanted hot water for tea, not warm. In addition we found it extremely strange that during lunch one of the waiters pushed a metal grocery cart through the aisle of the restaurant full of cutlery... talk about ruining the atmosphere. By the time we were done, we were ready to leave and we had yet another person (a waitress this time) bring us the bill. Needless to say we will not be going back to Toulas it was awful!!!!! To be fair though they did have a beautiful view from where they were located. At one point during the meal my cousin went to the washroom which was located downstairs and she said she saw a cockroach!! Wish I got a picture of that"}
{"text":"Firstly, there were crab shells in my crab salad ; no one wants that . Food overall was okay , not fresh however service was Good everyone was friendly , But i expected more from a winterlicous selected restaurant ."}
{"text":"First impression - no one was at the hostess stand to greet us.. That is probably my biggest pet peeve. We stood there for awhile until someone finally came out from the bar area to tell us someone will be here shortly..  Service was kind of slow.. Nice, but slow. The person who came to first greet us asked us if we wanted flat or sparkling water,  then served it to us.. And then leaves. We originally thought he was our server but I guess he wasn't because a little later our server finally came .. He should've told us and clarify that someone else will be on our way. Overall.. Our server was really nice but not as attentive.   Food was mediocre.. I expected to be amazing but it was just meh.   I'm not sure if I would ever come here again... Maybe if the service was phenomenal then I would reconsider.. It was just a nice try out place .. For the view that is."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful, situated on the 38th floor diners have a full view of the Toronto islands and Queens Quay area.   As for the food, I came for summerlicious and it was satisfying. I liked how I had a lot of options. I originally ordered sea bass with risotto and unfortunately had to send it back because the risotto was uncooked. It also didn't taste good and was bland so I asked for the lobster ravioli replacement. This was good but the edges of the ravioli pasta was  a little tough.   The service at times was a little too enthusiastic and almost felt like we were being rushed or pressed for an answer. The manager was really nice and gave us complimentary prosecco for our table in lieu of the poor risotto, which apparently was a common complaint.   It's a nice restaurant with decent food and beautiful views."}
{"text":"Womp womp.  ^ that's supposed to be that sound effect when something fails and is disappointing...  you know the one? I'll sum it up for you real quick and you can read the rest if you want: Tacky decor, good service, sub-par generic hotel/banquet hall food.  Anyways, my friend and I went here after a day on Toronto Island.  First off, the decor felt like I was going to my Grandma Hilda's house, furnished in dingy 1990's deteriorating ornateness.   The decorating was just such a fail, it's almost abusive to that gorgeous panoramic view. We ordered off the summerlicious menu. Appetizers: My friend got the Swordfish Carpacio which was more like a raw fish fillet slapped lazily on a bed of baby greens (when the menu said arugala). I got the shrimp which was 3 decently seasoned little buggers on that same 6 or 7 leaves of baby green. Mains: Rack of Lamb: really small portion of fatty plainly seasoned lamb. A few pathetic roasted potatoes that were roasted to death and some lame boiled veggies Stuffed Cornish Hen: Not even a whole cornish hen like the menu would lead one to believe.  It was 3 tiny medalions rolled around some average stuffing.  On that same bed of generic potatoes and veggies. Dessert: Grocery-store quality tiramasu"}
{"text":"First time here, and I must admit I'm shocked by the past poor reviews. We just had 7 dishes (salad, soup, 4 entrees, 3 desserts) and they were all excellent. Price is appropriate for the quality and location. Service (Sherif was our lead server) was outstanding; Italian music in the background the perfect touch. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"The view & service was excellent.  However the food was probably one of the worst I have tasted in many years!  Cornish hen was burnt, seabass was dry & salty :( stick with drinks & desserts only!"}
{"text":"Food: Came here for a friend's birthday, ordered off the their pre-fixe lunch menu, main course choice between veal with saffron risotto, salmon with lemon parsley risotto, and chicken with parmigiano. When they brought the meals, all the veal meals were served with some veggies and without the saffron risotto as stated on the menu, all the lemon parsley risotto had too much lemon and was too sour, more than two chicken meals were served with undercooked chicken.   Service: Servers spoke to each other loudly in a non-English language very close to our table. When we finished our meals, we were not offered coffee or tea, we had to ask for it. It also took an extremely long time to process our payments.  Overall: If you get the right table, the view is pretty gorgeous. Besides that, I would probably never go to this restaurant again since the price of the meal was not worth the mediocre food or service."}
{"text":"The view simply isn't remotely worth it. This place is way beyond tired - they have given up on good food, good service. The prices suggest they don't get it. Previous reviews are right on they don't care. Weird."}
{"text":"The view was decent, but the dining experience however was mediocre at best.   Also, some of their music was SO annoying, it didn't fit the ambience at all and it basically sounded like hollow tubes playing the same note (+ an octave above) for about 10 min.  No.   We came slightly early for our 6PM reservation, and was seated promptly.  However, the table next to us was also seated about 30 seconds earlier but they ended up finishing their entire meal before our main course was even served (what??).  The waiter passing by would keep telling us that our dish would be coming soon, but it came a good time after the other table left.  When ordering steak, our waiter said we could only get the steak medium done, supposedly because there were 700 people there toninght.  I had originally requested medium rare which would take less time to make, how does that even make sense?  The creme brulee was nice, however their cheesecake was kinda meh, barely above supermarket quality.     In the end, the waiter kept ALL the money without even returning any of the change, which ended up being a 30% tip.  Seriously.  Also, they don't take debit, so we had to use some ATM machine in the restaurant apparently because their machines are too 'outdated'.....really?  TLDR; do not come here for winterlicious."}
{"text":"Where should I start with this restaurant??? First of all if I said the service was slow it would be a compliment to the restaurant. When I saw aged stake on the menu I didn't realize it meant from the time I ordered to the time I received the stake... The Roma salad was par at best, the cheese plate was overpriced.  The waiter checked on us once during an hour wait for our food.  Finally when we asked for the bill we had to ask 5 times until we finally got our bill. The waiter must have had too many tables to serve because all the tables were complaining about the service.  If you are looking for a night out make sure you have multiple hours planned before you come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"**2.5 stars- based on my Summerlicious experience.  I made a reservation for two people for their $35/person Summerlicious during peak dinner hours. We walked into a busy (but not packed) restaurant overlooking the water and the islands.  It was a gorgeous view!  A casual atmosphere filled with friends, chit chat in a fairly nice setting.  We were greeted pleasantly by the hostess who sat us by the window.  So far so good!  As usual, it took us a long time to to decide what we liked to eat and drink.  No server greeted us.  The table behind us were sat AFTER us and got service and drinks already.  Finally, our server came up just to tell us he will be right with us.  He came back 10 minutes after we were sat (clearly flustered and frustrated) and took our orders.  APPS: 3/5 stars Torcello- prosciutto-wrapped lobster tail over arugula drizzled with balsamic reduction.  Not as good as it sounds as I was kind of disappointed, especially since it was... warm.  Good size for an app though. Ca Roman- black tiger shrimps lightly sauteed over saffron risotto with a buerre blanc.  The sauce was good, and the risotto wasn't bad, but nothing was amazing.  MAIN: 4/5 stars Beef tenderloin filet w sauteed rapini and roasted potatoes- cooked and seasoned perfectly with promising sides.  Delicious! Veal Medallion- advertised to be topped with a sauv blanc fontina cheese fondue and sliced black truffle. Sounds good right? Yea, that's the best it gets because it was just served with rapini and roasted potatoes.  When I asked the server, he had no idea and had to look at the menu.  He agreed that it was what it said on the menu but insisted that that was how the veal always came out.  Okay, so... don't put what you are not serving on the menu.  Also, how can the server not have reviewed what's actually on the menu!?!  But I do have to credit how good the veal was.  DESSERT: 3/5 stars Baked Peach Strudel- served with hazelnut gelato.  Pretty good. Affogato- classic vanilla gelato topped with a shot of espresso.  Just like what I expected but I've had waaaayyy better at another brunch place.  Maybe because I like the ice cream slightly melted.  SERVICE: 2/5 stars Our server sucked.  Took him 10 minutes to approach us, apps came before our drinks, water had to be asked twice.  I also asked for a paper napkin to spit out my gum so I can eat. But he forgot about that either, I had to ask the server assistant. I think he was either really new or just inexperienced becauise he was apologetic and tried to make up for it by taking pictures for us.  But, exhibited his lack of organization again when he chased after us thinking we didn't pay our bill when we already put it on a credit card.  Being a server myself, I understand how frustrating and hard it can be, but it was all over his face and body language.  Not cool.  View was amazing!! I absolutely loved watching the planes land and boats cruising along the water in the midst of the sunset.  Too bad the restaurant used this as their way to get pass the mediocre food and poor execution of menu and service.  However, I have noticed that the server taking care of the table behind us seemed pretty awesome.  Sorry Toula, not coming back."}
{"text":"I read a lot of the bad reviews about this place, and I wanted to add some positives about the restaurant. I went here on a Wednesday night for dinner as I was staying at the Westin. I ordered the salad and risotto. The salad was huge and very fresh. The risotto was AMAZING. It had burrata in it and the creamy texture was divine. We could see the CN tower perfectly, so not sure why people don't love the view. Also, the view out over the lake is breathtaking. Yes, this place was probably decorated 30+ years ago originally, but it adds a sense of charm and coziness. Our server was very helpful and nice. He offered recommendations for local bars in Toronto (as I'm from NYC) and was very friendly and helpful with questions on the menu. They even let us stay late after the restaurant closed to finish our wine. I came back the next night for a nightcap drink and the bartenders were all very friendly. If you're staying at this Westin, it's an easy elevator ride away for no hassle and friendly service, and top notch risotto!"}
{"text":"Aside from the over priced and small portioned food that tasted alright, our server Olaf (sorry if I misspelt your name) was extremely nice and very attentive. I made a reservation and requested a seat by the window. We were seated quickly and the view was great."}
{"text":"Winterlicious Lunch $23  Overall not a pleasant experience - food was very disappointing for the tier. Service was mediocre, and the surrounding was too warm, along with very low-par decor. It was for a group of 6 for lunch.   App I tried a seafood soup. It was not only luke warm but too salty. Friends of mine who tried the salads/cheese plate were not very impressed either.  Main This has got to be one of the most disappointing mains I've had to date. I had the salmon; it was 2 small pieces of mid-warm fish with a small puff pastry. Taste was blend and it definitely does not stand out. (2.5/5)  A friend of mine got the chef special and was extremely unsatisfied; the  flavors were very blend, texture was mushy and serving very small.  Dessert I had the tiramisu - this one was decent. Overall dessert was the highlight among the meal.  For a restaurant that boasts the Toronto view, Toula suffices; however, the dining experience and price-value was definitely not on-par with anything close to the level it brands. The chef needs to revisit the menu and property should really evaluate this restaurant for the future!"}
{"text":"We came here for a summerlicous. It was also our very first. Not knowing what to expect we ordered our meal. We got the first course pretty quickly however my salad had quiet a bit of dirt in it. It took more then an hour to get the second course and it was a steak Very well done when I had asked for medium rare. The desert was awful too. One of the worst meals I have had in the city for sure!"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever...Do not ever come. We had reservations for 9pm. We got here for 830pm. We got our table at 9:50pm. The first meal comes at 10:52pm to be specific. I am still here waiting for my main course as I write this review. Its 11:30pm. I still have my mains and desert to go. Average time between a meal is 45-55mins. Terrible Terrible! Capacity of the place is 500 people. They booked 800.... Jeez!!!! The funniest part is that the Manager is servicing....."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that me and my party were from Washington DC, so it's possible (probably not) that our expectations were above average.  The #1 reason we picked this venue of the many available options was for the view of the CN Tower as advertised on the FRONTpage of the website (http://www.toularestaurant.com).    Our party of five shows up to the restaurant at 8pm (to catch a post sunset view of the CN Tower) and were told a private party was taking place in the section of the restaurant that has the CN Tower view, however, once we were ready, we could walk over and take some pictures.  Cool. No prob there.  Waiter comes over and I ask \"hey can we take pictures at some point?\"...he replies, \"yes but you can't really see the CN Tower. A couple of building have been put up since\". So I ask \"well how old is the picture on the site?\". He responds \"about 10 years old\"...Anyways, that sums up my disappointment.  The food was ok...Butternut Squash Soup, Silverback Tenderloin, and rounds and rounds of German beer.  The decor and ambiance was pretty nice"}
{"text":"Went for a dinner with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day , place is nice food was decent wasn't really happy with the server that was serving me kinda gross caught him picking his nose and then putting the Remains in a serving napkin , was very disgusted by this and still thinking about it till this day he also served me water and something was floating in it (in the back of my mind his booger) and ended up drinking my boyfriends water as a result.. Defiantly will not be returning to this restaurant and wouldn't recommend it unless you are interested in eating human remains"}
{"text":"Beautiful view.  But seriously folks, get it together.   It's 2017, you should know better.   I saw another review that said something about no truffles when there were supposed to be truffles.  Same experience.  Server told me they ran out.  They must have ran out a few years ago.   I ordered the pork tenderloin with risotto which clearly was cooked a while ago because it came out in two minutes.   The mushroom risotto should have been called \"salt fest\".    It was cold, which I could forgive, but it was mushy and salty to the point of inedible.  I am brutally honest but I'm also not a jerk about it and I NEVER want a bad meal taken off the bill.   The chef on his own sent out another risotto, that was, sadly, even saltier.     Round this out with rancid olive oil served with the focaccia and it is a sad state of affairs.   The wine was good.  Anyway, they should pivot.   The location is great and done right this place could be a winner.  I should have read the reviews first.  My own fault"}
{"text":"Went here because of convenience as we are staying in the Westin.  The place was filthy.  The carpet was nasty and needed to be replaced.  The ceiling needed to be repainted. Service was not good.  Waited for a long time for refills on drinks.  Did not get asked once if everything was okay.    Thankfully the food was very good.  My wife had the salmon with risotto and I had the 8oz filet.  Both were delicious. The view was great, but I would not recommend this to anyone including our group of 400 coming next October.    I was truly disappointed that the top floor restaurant of a Westin was this bad."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious Pros: Beautiful scenic view of the harbour from the 38th floor. Cons: Bad service. Bread n butter was served after appetizers and came at same time as main course. WTF?! Food was terrible. Had the shrimp cocktail - shrimp was dry like jerky not fresh tasted like cardboard. The main, AAA beef tenderloin meh..the veggies that came with it was dry as a desert. It was obvious that the food was precook in large batches and just scooped on plates as they are ordered.  TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!"}
{"text":"Like Stas, I didn't have a great experience with the food. It wasn't terrible, but for a restaurant that's situated high up at the Westin Harbour Castle with an amazing view, it was plain disappointing.  I came here for Winterlicious in January 2009.  Being vegetarians, my sister and I both started with steamed white asparagus with truffle cream sauce and parmigiano reggiano shavings. It was lukewarm and the asparagus plant was a bit too old, making it quite a task to chew (I gave up when my knife wouldn't go through it).  For our main, we had a hand-made butternut squash ravioli with rose sauce; it wasn't bad but there are a number of places around Toronto that could serve the same dish at better quality and fairer prices. The Venetian tiramisu wasn't too bad, but again, nothing memorable.  Friends have also confirmed that they've been let down by the food in the past, so I won't be visiting again unless something really changes."}
{"text":"My fiance took me here for Valentine's day and the menu was prix fixe of $85 per person with 18% gratuity. He ended up picking Toula as the CN Tower was fully booked over a month in advance...I guess there was a reason why this restaurant had availability!  Aside from the view, I have nothing much to boast about this place. We paid $15 for parking across the street and scrambled over here in the freezing cold. We had a view facing the east side along the lake..I would imagine the view be quite nice if you face the city at night (as there are more lights).  The menu came with 2 appetizers, a main, dessert and two shots (as palette cleansers?).  The food choice was was not bad, I had the halibut with risotto and he had the steak; large portions. My main was slightly overcooked but the flavours were good.   The dessert was a complete joke, there was a small shot glass of pureed fruits, a chocolate pudding-type thing that was melting...and a tiny square of cheesecake which looked like something from the frozen section at No Frills!  Overall, I don't know if I would come back for the price...$250 for two is pretty steep for a mediocre set dinner. The interior décor is quite dated and I noticed that they have a mixture of old chairs and plastic ones.. does not look visually pleasing as they seem to be randomly dispersed across the restaurant."}
{"text":"Actually I would give 5 for food 2 for service.   Lets start with our food I ordered Tagliolini Verdi del toula the white cream sauce was so delicious and the home pasta was to die for and the pancetta made this so yummy.  My hubby ordered Ravioli collata.  The flavors burster when you are the homemade ravioli.  The robiola cheese and smoked ricotta with pancetta made us want more.   Our server was so helpful and made our meal interesting with fun facts about the area. But it stopped after our meal.  We ordered our desserts and at a same time a wedding party of about 20 people came in.  This is where the manager screwed up.  They were expected but there was not enough wait staff to handle them.  There was the greeter, our server and his asst.  But what happened one of our desserts we ordered was not available.  According to the manager after waiting 30 minutes he told me they did not have it and gave me an alternative. He gave it to me free but I think our whole dessert ordered should have been free from our coffee, tea and my husband's tirimsu. So I would avoid ordering ricotta cheese cake. This was all on the manager we watched others in the dining room wait once the wedding party came.  They were not prepared for this big group and the rest of us suffered.  It took us over an hour to receive our desserts. With no coffee or tea refills while we waited."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Made reservations for winterlicious in advance. On the day of they claimed that they dont do reservations. Horrible service. Washroom is beyond ghetto, looks like a service stop washroom. Washroom smelled so bad. Only 1 out of 5 washrooms worked the rest were flooded. Food is not that great. There was a fly in my sisters water. Save your money. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I read a lot of bad reviews of this place but I do not know what they were talking about. This is a great restaurant with great food and a awesome wine list. I had the lamb and it was perfectly prepared.. Oh and then there's the view, it's spectacular! You have a 306 degree view of the city so where ever you sit you will have an amazing view. Sunset was amazing !"}
{"text":"If you really don't want to leave the hotel or can't leave the hotel then go ahead and eat here but be prepared to pay 150% normal pricing for 50% flavour. The salmon was fine but the breaded veal visually unappetizing. The ricotta cheesecake was dry and the pistachio gelato lacked flavour. The server was fine, the view nice, but overall a disappointing dinner. The best part was the company; my husband."}
{"text":"Greeting- Yes Vibe- Mile High Club Service- good Price- High Parking- hotel Food Gnocchi was very good $19 Poached pear dessert was very good $11 WIGB? For the views"}
{"text":"We came here for winterlicious for my birthday. There were so many options so we were excited to try it. The review for Andrea Boscherini was setting the bar really high. We were a group of 10 with reservations.   We were running a tad late due to traffic but when we got there the table was set with a view of the CN tower. Mila our waitress came by right away and asked if my boyfriend and I wanted drinks while we wait for everyone else. I thought we were off to a great start!  Once we all got there and our orders were taken we were anticipating some amazing food to come out. So first the appetizers. My boyfriend had the shrimp cocktail - a dry tasteless dish with some sort of disgusting jello. There were three other who got this dish. It was presented differently for each and the only thing that was consistent was how horrible it tasted. I ordered the caprese salad - another huge disappointment just looks like they cut the cheese and threw it on top not caring what it looks like. The taste was very bland.  Moving on to the main dishes. I had the PEI lobster hand made tagliolini - flavourless and the lobster seemed under cooked. My boyfriend had the Filetto alla Piemontese - again flavourless needed seasoning. The grosses one yet was the Red Beet and Amarone Della Valpoliceella wine carnaroli risotto - it looked like a pile of mush with a white happy face. It tasted like mush.   By the time we got to dessert we were pretty much over it. We just wanted our bill and we wanted to go get street meat outside of the hotel.   The ONLY good thing about this place is Mila! Thank you for being so accommodating and understanding. You're wonderful, you should work in a restaurant that doesn't serve shit food!"}
{"text":"Came here with an amazing girl in late July for Summerlicious 2015 at 8:00 PM. The restaurant is rated in the following criteria, atmosphere, cleanliness, food quality and customer service.  We took the express elevator up to the restaurant and enjoyed the city view going up. However, we were under the impression that this restaurant would be fancy. As soon as we got there, we both agreed that the restaurant was kind of ghetto. The restaurant had carpet, which we always felt to be unappealing in restaurants, there was an abundant amount of glasses and utensils on the ledge of the seating area and the chairs were made out of cheap transparent plastic. The view of the city was lovely and the restaurant only looked better as we went into the night and the lighting appeared to be dim.   Our waiter gave us the wrong appetizers but let us keep them and gave us extra. The food was decent but that not memorable. The place was clean but because of the clutter and carpet, it did not feel that way. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I came here around 12pm with my cousin - based on the restaurant's website, the restaurant advertised that they have brunch, and even had photos of it. So, we went assuming we would go have brunch.  When we get there, the menu looks like they have dinner items only - who us 10 oz. strip loin at 12 in the afternoon?! Confused that these were not brunch items, we ask the waiter for the correct menu and his response was \"We haven't done brunch for years...\" Um....okay, so why was it advertised in its website?  The fact that they haven't done brunch for years and yet, have not changed the website is baffling to me and very deceptive to customers. If you don't have brunch, then take it off your website so you can avoid the onslaught of angry customers.  Obviously, my cousin and I walked out of the restaurant, as we weren't about to have dinner at 12pm. The view was great, but not impressive. Also, there were creepy looking bugs on the outside of the windows! Gross!  Shame on you, Toulla, for your deceptive advertising."}
{"text":"The food is not worth the price, the service is really bad. I go to Toula every year and the quality is getting worse and worse. This year I decided to give it a last chance to see if they have improvement or not, but sadly it is even worse than before.   I really like the view there, but I can't stand the waiters there. Our waiter asked if we want to have wine once we sit down, TWO TIMES. After he got the answer no, he became really rude to us. Then he took our order impatiently without any confirmation. Food took ages to arrive and not worth the wait! Not what you expected to have in high-end restaurant but more like what you got at home.  The waiter didn't remember what we ordered so every time when the food arrived, he either ask \"who order this, who order that\" or just put the food in front of us randomly so we have to change it by ourselves.The waiter didn't even ask if we want black pepper but I saw him behaved ingratiatingly to the large group of people next to our table who ordered some white wines.  I will never go back to Toula again or recommend this restaurant to anyone. Can you imagine? Even the Keg is better than this place."}
{"text":"Beautiful view. The place was over crowded with much room to move and it was extermely noisy which was due to the winterlicious event . I did see some staff checking coats for other guests and would have been great to experience that service as well. Staff were very friendly and professional. Waiter provided us with ample feedback on the food and wine selection. What i did not enjoy was the food. The quality was not there and i'm guessing due to winterlicious. The pasta was severly over cooked and Lamb was good. The portions served for the winterlicious is not sufficient to feed someone hungry. Going back to try the food after winterlicious is over for a second opnion - quality of food may be better."}
{"text":"In Toronto for 30th anniversary. Heard of the summerlicious thing and decided to give this place a chance even with only a 2star rating.   I had the sea bass with risotto and thought it was pretty good. The risotto made the dish.  The crab app missed big time. No flavor, bland city!!   Tiramisu was okay but a little dry. Too much coco power on top. Wish they would have suggested a dessert wine to go with."}
{"text":"If I could I would've rated this half a star.  To start, my family and I went to Toula last night for Winterlicious.  My parents love that place and have never had a bad experience until last night.  To be honest it wasn't just one thing that made the evening less enjoyable but a whole series of events..  I was the first to arrive with another guest and instead of being seated at our table by the hostess, we had to wait for the hostess and her 2 hostess friends to finish their conversation about how tired they were before being seated at our table.  Once we got comfortable, another guest had arrived.  When she sat down she had told us that she basically had to find our table and seat herself because the hostess, who had told our guest that we had arrived and would bring her to the table, was still busy socializing.  Once all our guests arrived, it took the waiter about 45 minutes before even coming over to the table to ask us what we wanted to drink.  By that time we decided to order our mains as well.  The only thing that was timely about the whole dining experience was the delivery of the bread to the table along with the appetizers.  Once the appetizers were done, it was another long wait for the main.  One of the guests had even asked for a refill on the bread which was acknowledged by the waiter, but our table never received it.    When the mains finally arrived, they were all lukewarm if not, cold (except for one dish).   I had ordered the ravioli, which sounded delicious on paper, but was cold in the middle and felt like it had sat on the pass for way too long. A few of the guests had order the beef tenderloin, but was never asked how they liked it cooked.  When one of them asked, they were told in a manner that implied that the beef was medium and that's what they will be getting (which they did).  The mashed potatoes that came with the beef tenderloin was cold.  By the time I was done my ravioli, the waiter finally came around to ask if any of us wanted fresh ground pepper on our meals.   By the time he was there, we were all half way or done our meals.  It felt like the waiter had forgotten about our table (not to mention the bread that was asked for after the apps...).    On to the desserts, although not very much to say about it except that I had ordered the chocolate torta that was dry and disappointing.  It was not very appetizing and I barely touched it.  While we were on the desserts, I had noticed that one of the servers had came out of the kitchen with the bread and was heading straight to our table (we were very close to the kitchen doors).  However, he stopped in his tracks when he noticed that we were already all in the middle of our desserts.  He looked very confused, turned around, and put the bread on a random serving table near our table.  It was clear that bread was meant for our table, but served just a few hours too late.    We were done our desserts for at least 30 minutes before the waiter even came over to see how we were doing.  There was no offer for tea or coffee, which was also quite disappointing as it would've been a nice way to end the evening.  Along with that, our dishes were not cleared until much later.  When the waiter finally came by, he knew we were not really happy with the whole experience, but did not really do anything to help the situation.   I do not usually write reviews, but when it's a bad experience, it's good to let people know about it.  My boyfriend tried to make eye contact with some of the management, who avoided him like the plague.  We had noticed that the managers had glanced at our table a few times, noticed that our table was not cleared, that things were not going well, but never came by to see what was going on.  Even when we were being served our meals, it was noticed that the plates were just sloppishly \"thrown\" at us instead of being placed down at the table.  It was just overall not a very good experience and I doubt we will make the effort to come back here."}
{"text":"Toula has the potential to be a really great  restaurant. Excellent location, spectacular views, and a modern decor. But that's where it ends. I went here for the very first time last night for a friends birthday and we had their Winterlicious menu. Because we were a group of 12 we did get a group rate of $35 which included a start, entree and desert.  The service was decent enough but very slow considering the restaurant was only half full. I ordered the Strawberry and Kale salad which was o.k, but the main course (The Angus fillet) was a major disappointment. Aside from not being a truly lean cut, it was very bland in taste (it should have been marinated a lot better than it was) The portion was small and it was served on a bed of mash potatoes with some vegetables on the side. For a drink I ordered the house Merlot ($12.00) which was o.k but  definitely overpriced. I had the Gelato for desert which was actually the best part of the meal. Yes the view is great here in the evening on the city side. Our servers though were attentive and friendly and they were worthy of 4 stars, but in the end, its the food that matters, hence the 2 stars. I definitely won't be back here."}
{"text":"This is for the summerlious that is going on now (2017).  Generally great experience!  $38 dinner, 7 appetizers, 7 main course and 4 desserts to choose from. More variety than other restaurants.   I called at 8:30 on a Friday night, got a table at 9pm.  No waiting when we arrived.  Nice view close to window with comfortable sofa sitting.    Service was courteous and fast, no long waiting time.  Proper candle dinner service.   Food taste good,  I mean all 3 courses are good.    Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at all the horrible reviews! Clearly they have stepped up on the service here, because our waiter was super attentive.  We were staying at the Westin Harbour Castle so decided to eat at Toula as it's inside in the hotel. It's up on the top floor with a few overlooking the lake on one side and overlooking the city on the other. The view is OK, I imagine it's nicer at lunch hour when you can see the lake in daylight.   I had a Toula Amore salad (arugula with strawberries, pine nuts and honey dressing) to start. Nice presentation, light, not too filling but tasty enough.  For my mains we had the ravioli (stuffed with spinach and ricotta) served with a small amount of buttery delicious sauce. The taste was delicious and the pasta was just a tad too \"al dente\" for me (I do tend to like my pasta overcooked!). Moro mu had the spaghetti and we shared a beef tenderloin. The beef was just OK, it was a bit chewy. Served with some fingerling potatoes and roasted veggies.  The dessert menu looked nice but I was too full to partake. I had a B52 coffee instead (with Baileys and Tia Maria). Very nice!  Prices were average for a fine dining establishment. Service was excellent but food was just OK. Probably only worth a visit if you happen to be staying at the Westin."}
{"text":"The food here was mediocre... The service was extremely rushed - I had my server standing over me waiting for me to finish each course. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and won't be back."}
{"text":"The beautiful views, and they are very beautiful, are hardly enough to make up for the complete lack of service, and inflated prices.  The cost of soup and a cold plate of pasta was 60 dollars. I had to beg for bread, and as I said before, the ravioli was close to frozen in the middle. I am not exaggerating here, actually freezing.   The experience was dulled by the fact that the food took forever to come out, and the waitress came over all of twice.    Don't waist your money."}
{"text":"Despite all the bad reviews I've seen before attending, the experience wasn't as bad as I thought. The view was great, got seated quickly and staff was attentive + friendly. However being seated by the window where the view was just a lake, by night there wasn't much to see so I highly recommend requesting seats near the buildings/ CN tower for a better view.   In terms of food, the appetizer we ordered was brought out pretty quickly but the entrees did take quite long. Taste was okay. (I enjoyed the garlic bread more) The ricotta cheesecake felt somewhat dry. Overall bill was quite expensive so I don't recommend dining here often.   Yes the atmosphere and view were pretty great, but the review to an extent lives up to what most people have already commented. Not worth spending that much for a pretty view."}
{"text":"3 stars if we consider the amazing view. Otherwise 2 stars for the food itself. My company held a dinner here and the staff was very kind and helpful - from the event planner Sonia to the restaurant manager who helped served us. Excellent attitude and service, they made sure our party was happy and comfortable.   The scenic view and calming atmosphere made for a great cocktail hour. The hor d'oeuvres we selected were delicious - the Smoked Salmon Crostini, Chicken Satay, Stuffed Mushroom Caps with Vegetable Mousse. The Chicken Satay was the most popular with our guests.... But felt dry. The Crostini was hard to bite into but I could overlook that because smoked salmon. The mushrooms were good but nothing to write home about. The cocktails itself could use a bit of work...   For the main dinner portion, we had a minestrone soup or salad for the appetizer, choice of salmon/chicken/pasta for the main course, and gelato/cheesecake/tiramisu for dessert. The salmon was surprisingly good, but the risotto it was on tasted sour. It wasn't just me, because several others felt the same. No complaints about dessert but you'd have to be a really bad restaurant to mess up dessert."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I was pretty disappointed. It's so hard to find a restaurant in Toronto with a decent view and legitimately great food.   The restaurant itself was lovely and the view was fantastic. Definitely a great atmosphere for a date. The view would make it a good place to bring friends from out of town. The water outside was beautiful and the ambience was just nice and relaxing.   Service was really average, nothing special. Our waiter was there when he needed to be but wasn't particularly attentive.   I had the lobster which was okay, a little dry but flavourful. I wouldn't order it again but it wasn't bad. My friend had the pasta which was not good. The pasta was overcooked and bland for the most part.   For dessert we had poached pears covered in chocolate which were obviously mass made and sitting in a fridge somewhere for who knows how long. I don't want to be overly critical but the food was just not up to standard at all. I might be willing to try this place again because the view was so nice though."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, when I was there they were running a special menu and it was fixed price with limited selection.  The view was great.  The food, not so much.  The crab cakes were overcooked tasteless fried cardboard.  The beef ragout was tasty and the panna cotta was good.  Overall, however, a lot of money for a mediocre meal.  I saw the regular menu and was tempted.  Perhaps it is better quality.  I hope so because the meal I had was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"when my best friend Li came to visit, I have brought her and another friend from Sweden to this restaurant. View was stunning but the dishes were just okay"}
{"text":"Like a lot of people have mentioned in other reviews, the key attraction to this place is the view. Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the place was quite empty, as like I said in my tip, this place is pricey -- even for lunch. Lunch options are $25+ and are more like dinner entrees. I got the steak which was good but not worth the price. The ambiance is quaint and the view of the lake is second to none as you'll see in the photos. If you just want to 'try' this place, I'd suggest winter or summerlicious for best value."}
{"text":"This past Sunday my girlfriends and I decided to check out Toula for Winterlicious. This was an Italian restaurant located on the 38th floor inside the Western Harbour Castle hotel. I let me girls decided this one. My friend who has been there before decided to drive. As soon as we pulled up to the hotel the valet driver was right there to assist us. Very friendly staff working at the hotel. When were were 10 mins away we realized we were going to be late so we called to inform the restaurant. They called back to see how far we were and sounded as if they would give our table away, at that point we had just pulled into the driveway.  When we arrived we told the lady at the front our names, she looked very confused as if we didn't have a reservation. We waiting about 5 mins before we were seated. My friend requested for a table by the Window when she made the reservation, lets just say we didn't get a table near the Window but super far.  My my appetizer I order the Dolce Vita Salad (roasted heirloom beet salad with prpprty argula, toasted sicilia pistachios, creamy goat cheese dressed with an apple, drizzled with mapple mustard vinaigrette) Let's say that's what's it was suppose to be.. I got a plate of argula with a few pieces of the other ingredients. Not impressed. For my main I ordered the Rack of Lamb with grilled seasonal vegetables served with squash and prosecco risoto. I was extreamly disappointed the risoto was a tablespoon and I got one very tiny piece. My friend ordered the Cornish hen, they didn't have any subsituted it for chicken. My friend said it came out cold. I ordered the Made in house vanilla gelato with amaretto marinated berries. That was the only thing that was decent I probably will not be returning"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. Thought the restaurant was suppose to spin but it wasn't spinning. It's okay I guess because the view was still beautiful. I ordered the gnocchi pasta and changed the sauce to rosa sauce. And my boyfriend had another type of pasta (can't remember the name). I thought my pasta was so tasty and flavorful. He also enjoyed his. The portion size was good for me but his looked kind of small for the price. The server was pleasant."}
{"text":"Service bad, food medium.  We were in a large group which I understand is tough, but they only had one server helping us.  He had a couple staffers with him, but they didn't come around very often.  It took ten minutes just to go around the table for our drink orders.  The food came out rather quickly, which did impress me.  Too bad it didn't taste better.  Nothing was seasoned.  Everyone immediately reached for the salt.  I had risotto; overcooked and bland.  My husband had sea bass.  Also overcooked and bland.  Great view if you happen to be seated in a good spot, but otherwise go elsewhere for a special evening.  It's overpriced and underwhelming."}
{"text":"Not calling it overpriced, cause it has such a great view of the city, but their menu is really simple, yet not too impressive. So you should be prepared to pay for the view instead of the food. The service is alright, but the management is ridiculous. The manager is not very well organized himself and is disrespectful to people. If you order cocktails, be prepared to have different taste for each glass. If you order meat, remember to double check how rare or well-done you want it to be. If you order a bottle of wine, just be patient cause they have no idea where to find it either. Fortunately they are a hotel restaurant with a great view, or they're probably long gone in an area with so many other great restaurants."}
{"text":"Decided to try out Toula for Summerlicious 2017. I had no idea the reviews for Toula were bad until I decided to check them out while waiting for our food. I'm not sure exactly why so many people had bad experiences.  The service from the time we arrived until we left was great. We were seated right away when we arrived for our dinner reservations at 5:30 pm. Our server was friendly and attentive throughout our visit.   We had the following during our dinner: Appetizers: Tagllere dello Chef & In House Salmone Affumicato Carpaccio. Nothing special. It was just cheese and cold cuts. The smoked salmon tasted like smoked salmon I buy at Costco; nothing special.  Mains: AAA Certified Beef Tenderloin & Grand Toula PEI Lobster. The beef tenderloin was quite small and he inhaled it pretty quick. He enjoyed the mashed potatoes even though he's not a fan of mashed potatoes. The lobster and pasta was subpar to me. Nothing stood out from the pasta and I was getting tired of eating it.  Desserts: Tiramisu & Ricotta Cheesecake. I enjoyed the cheesecake but was too full to finish the entire slice.  Overall, food was average. Nothing stood out or wowed us.  The two main things that were good at Toula was the service and the view of the lake. Also, I think the décor needs to be updated."}
{"text":"Our server was Shareef. He was very helpful and made our experience here so much better. The food portions were good, not large, but totally acceptable. We had questions about what to order and Shareef gave us great advice. Everything we ate was delicious and while it was a little pricey, we were prepared for it."}
{"text":"I've been disappointed by winterlicious in the past but thought I'd give it another shot. The menu looked inspired so i was really excited.   First impressions: the decor was out dated, the hostess was unpleasant. Not off to a good start.   We were seated and the view was impressive. Our server took our order and before I had time to blink our appetizers had arrived. I ordered the caprese salad and my husband got a mushroom and polenta dish. My salad was average - over dressed and topped with an unnecessary slice of avacado. The mushroom dish was terrible - luke warm and very beige. Not appetizing at all.   We ordered a wine pairing - 2 glasses of wine to accompany your appetizer and main for $12. A good deal!   We waited a while for our mains to arrive, but not too long. I ordered AAA fillet and my husband ordered pasta with a lobster tail. The steak had nice flavor and the sides (mash potatoes and asparagus) were ok. I enjoyed most of my steak but as i got towards the middle (and the end) my medium rare steak became more rare with every cut :( The pasta dish arrived and just looked terrible. The sauce was watery and flavorless and the lobster tail was extreamly over cooked.   Our server never came to check on us until he collected our plates. No chance to say my steak wasn't cooked enough or even get a refill on drinks.   Dessert - strawberry cheese cake and orange chocolate mousse. Both dishes were tasty! But not enough to salvage the otherwise pretty disappointing experience.   If I am to take away anything from this experience it's not to attend a winterlicious event. However - this was a pretty bad dining experience i don't think I'd even give Toula a second chance!"}
