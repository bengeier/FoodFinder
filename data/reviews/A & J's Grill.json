{"text":"Waitresses are hot,  food is awesome,  price is right, service is fast,  and place is clean. Love it here."}
{"text":"I don't live in Cleveland anymore, but I did grow up there.  Every time I go home, I make it a point to get at least one meal from A & J's grill.  

The menu is mostly sandwiches, but they've also got fries (waffle cut and sweet potato) and some other sides.  The sweet potato fries are some of the best I've had. 

As for the sandwiches, they can come hot or cold (I prefer hot).  They put a crazy amount of toppings on there, including banana peppers, mayo, and oil.  Those toppings all come standard, so you have to specify what you do not want.  Otherwise, you will end up with a humongous mess.  Some items to consider: Buffalo chicken sub is very good.   The cheeseburger sub (yes, cheeseburger sub) is also worth trying.  They have a solid Italian sandwich as well.  

All in all, A & J's makes some of the best sandwiches on the west side of Cleveland.  It should definitely be getting more love on Yelp."}
{"text":"Food was fresh. Grilled chicken was tasty. Brought me wrong salad dressing. When I inquired was told it was the salad dressing I ordered but as I  suspected it wasn't. Added sweet potato fries to my order but never got them."}
{"text":"I love their steak and cheese sub and Onion rings. The place is very clean and people are so nice."}
{"text":"This place has some really good food and the staff is always nice. If it's busy though you'll be lucky to find a seat and you might be waiting."}
{"text":"I love the steak salad even though i tend to have them take a bunch of stuff off and add different. They are really good about that. they have no problem changing the way they make things for the way you want to have it. I have had several things here from wings and strips, to salads and subs and everything is always extremely fresh and delicious. The service couldn't get better even on the busy days, they make sure you are acknowledged which is all anyone ever wants. i love this place and have never had a bad thing to say about it. and keep in mind i was eating there once to twice a week when i worked down the street. Just thinking about them now i think i might head up there for lunch!!"}
{"text":"With about only seating for 30 or so, A&J's Grill is one of the smallest eateries I've been to that's located in Westlake area.  Their kitchen is almost equal the size of their seating area.  During my lunch-time visit - a full house - the two wait staff were doing double duty of being servers as well as cashiers.  This lead to many forgotten requests from patrons including myself of some of the basic like utensils & napkins.  What was even more interesting was that the kitchen had 4 staff and 2 of them were just standing around.

The menu consists of wraps, pita, burger, usual deli type appetizers all ranging from $6 to $8.  The quality of food isn't anything to write home about pretty standard quality.  A&J's is a good place for lunch stop at a pinch but if the place is crowded be prepared to make it a very long lunch.  I did enjoy their specially made and brought-in from NYC (I was told) hot pepper sauce on the side.  My grilled chicken pita pocket was not bad but not make my taste buds jump in joy.

I feel A&J's has potential with some major adjustments to staff to patron ratio and a bit more injection of flavor to their offerings they can certainly shine."}
{"text":"We were only driving through Cleveland on the way to Milwaukee, and we needed to stop for lunch. This is a pretty small restaurant, but it is very well decorated and arranged. It was quiet---perhaps because they just opened for the day, and there was only one other table full--- which was a nice break from the usually noisy restaurants. The food is your basic sandwiches and grinder fare, which they did pretty well and pretty inexpensively. The server was sweet and attentive, perhaps because she didn't have much else to do, but nevertheless, was better than many of the others on our trip. Nice little spot that bodes well for Westlake's image."}
{"text":"This place is actually really very good. Its small and homey. The food is good. Simple sandwiches and pizza and wraps. The owners also own stonehouse grill in westlake. The reason it does not get five stars is because they follow the stereotypical restaurant tradition. Women in front men in back. As a hopeful restaurant owner I wish places would break that is this is 2011 and not 1950. It does not help that sometimes the attractive high school girls they have working are nothing but attractive. Brains optional I guess."}
