{"text":"This place was great! Wonderful and  friendly service, delicious and hot homemade tortilla chips, and delicious entrees. We had vegetarian enchiladas and the chicken torta.  Everyone loved their food and we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We arrived on a sunday evening with a bucky book coupon (two for the price of one entree). I ordered the mixed seafood fajita. The flange steak slices were overly seasoned of salt and the beans seemed to be microwaved. The beans were warm with other parts cold. My wife also ordered a steak dish which was also overly seasoned of salt.  I made the mistake of not researching this place on yelp before coming. I took a chance because of the coupon i had. It was also a karaoke night and the music was deafening from the rear area which I didn't mind but my companion did. We were the only ones dinning with a few people karaoking. im not sure of how this place is during lunch or the weekdays or how the other foods are but we probably will not be returning, If we do it will be for a drink and to karaoke."}
{"text":"I had credit from Restaurant.com and decided to buy a voucher for this restaurant/bar. It's easy to miss, so be on the lookout for a small sign and the laundromat next door. We could hear the karaoke as we walked along the sidewalk. My hubs and I gave each other a glance of apprehension, but me being a stickler for deals and following through, we ventured in. It's a pretty narrow place with some seating in front then a long bar with more seating behind on a raised level. Not fancy, leaning towards dive-ish.  There were a few people karaoking at the bar. We were greeted and took a seat in a booth on the raised level. It didn't matter where we sat, it was pretty loud in there. Oh, were we praying for good food!   Service was prompt and helpful. The menu was pretty much all over the place, delving into Italian, Japanese, American, and Mexican dishes.  We ordered tacos since we are a bit of taco buffs. There was a variety to choose from: carnitas, asada, pastor, nopales, tofu, campechano-to name a few. We ordered a dinner of two tacos, rice and beans for $8 and two tacos at $2 a piece. The tacos were deliciosos! The tortillas were a bit smaller than other locations, but good meat flavors.  In between polka and Selena karaoke songs, we both agreed that this would be a place to try again."}
{"text":"Hey, so I finally go in here to the restaurant itself.  They give no sh*t that we're here.  They barely even acknowledge that we're there.  Music is blaring from the back(Karaoke?)  I ask for something.  They say they don't serve it THAT day.  K, not ordering from here. Nice knowing ya!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the food was pretty good. I would give them 4 stars for their Menudo.  Everything else was terrible though.  I saw this place on Yelp, and it sounded interesting so I bought the $20 for $30 deal and made a reservation in the Yelp app. We came in at 9 pm on a Saturday. There was a DJ playing Mexican music at a deafening volume. Seriously, I've been going to metal concerts for years and this was pretty comparable. The customers and bartender looked at us funny; maybe it was unusual to have Asian customers at such a late time or even customers that arent just there to drink.  After a minute of awkward staring, I finally went up to the bar and asked if we could sit down for dinner. They didnt acknowledge the reservation from the Yelp app.  The bartender acted as our waitress and brought us water. She seemed unprepared for serving dinner; I'm willing to bet the real wait staff went home for the day. She asked if we were ready to order right away, but we asked for more time. We decided what to order to make use of our $20 for $30 deal in a few minutes, but the bartender took 20 minutes to come back to our table and take our order. When she took our order, she had to look at our menus as if she didnt know any of the foods we were talking about.  When the food came, it came in bad timing; my food and the other person at my table's food came about 10 minutes apart, and their rice and beans came 5 minutes after their fajitas came to the table.  When we were finished eating, it took long time to get our check. The staff also had trouble using the $20 for $30 deal from my phone, and they said the electronics in the register werent working so they could only take cash even though i saw them handling another patron's credit card. Still, I was just sick of dealing with them at this point so i just gave them the cash. They took my $20 for $30 deal and $25 in cash then gave me $13 in change. I don't know why this was necessary to give them $25 instead of $20, and im pretty sure my bill should have been less than $40 total, so I think i got stiffed a little but i was really just trying to leave. I couldnt verify the price of my meal since they said they couldnt print me a receipt.  This ordeal of deafening music and bad service lasted over 1.5 hours. The food was pretty good though."}
{"text":"The set up was kind of strange because it is a bit hard to find and is not set up like a regular chain restaurant, but oh my word was the food AMAZING!  I will definitely be going back every time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Good, basic Mexican restaurant.  My margarita was good.  Lots of food for the price.  The \"fusion\" idea is on hold right now, we found out.  There's a new owner, sounds like, and still figuring out what the menu will be.  So, there's no Japanese or Italian food being offered (although the menu shows it as being available.)"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I did not have high expectations for Sol Azteca.  From the uninspiring storefront to its handwritten fusion menu featuring Asian and Mexican cuisine, this restaurant raised more red flags than a Soviet-era May Day parade.  However, I cast those apprehensions aside and ended up getting a pretty solid lunch during my recent visit.  If you ascribe to the philosophy for Mexican food joints that the sketchier the restaurant, the better the chow, then Sol Azteca is a must visit.  The restaurant, across from the abandoned Thorstad auto dealership on Park Street and sharing a space with the South Park Coin Laundry, is easy to miss.  Cautiously stepping through the door, I was greeted by an empty, dimly lit restaurant to could have served as the set for the straight to video budget sequel of From Dusk to Dawn - not an auspicious start.  I grabbed a table in the back and the restaurant's cleanliness impressed me.  While the ramshackle building showed its age in places (tears in the faux leather booths and numerous scratches on the tabletops), the tabletops and floors were remarkably clean.  I also was pleasantly surprised to see the restaurant had free wi-fi for customers (password protected).  Once I settled in, my server provided me with a menu.  It was the first time I ever witnessed teriyaki chicken and tripe tacos sharing menu space - I can check that off my bucket list.  With over 10 different taco filling options to chose from, there are plenty of choices for both adventurous and cautious eaters.   My soft-spoken server did not speak great English and I continue to curse my decision to take high school German instead of Spanish, so I appreciated that my server pointed to each of my choices (pollo, pastor and barbacoa tacos) to confirm my order.  Despite the language barrier, my server did a great job during my stay at Sol Azteca.    Within five minutes of making my order, my food arrived, which was a good thing, because Sol Azteca does not offer a complimentary basket of chips and salsa.  Overall, the plate looked appetizing.  Sprinkled with the traditional toppings of diced onions and cilantro, I noticed all three tacos had generous portions of the meat fillings.   At first, I thought the cook also topped my tacos with chives, but upon closer examination, I realized it was the woody end of the cilantro stems.  The cook did a tremendous job preparing each of the fillings - I encountered no unpleasant textures in any of the three tacos.  The tortillas were fresh and provided great corn flavor.  On the other hand, all three fillings needed a little more seasoning to amp up the flavor.  Next time I will ask to for hot sauce to fill that void.  I enjoyed the pastor taco the most - great porky flavor complemented by sautéed onions and juicy pineapple.  The kitchen also nailed the texture by including some crispy pieces to go with the rest of the fork-tender shredded meat.    The pollo also was solid, packed with a serious helping of tender, shredded white meat.  While the tomato base offered some flavor, the chicken really needed more seasoning to provide some much needed zip.    The barbacoa was the last taco I tried and it had cooled by the time I got to it, which contributed to its overall dry, chewy texture.  Like the chicken, this shredded beef practically begged for some additional seasoning to punch up the flavor.  A side of rice and beans accompanied my taco platter ($7.99).  While I enjoyed the rice, the beans looked pureed and needed a serious dose of salt.     While Sol Azteca had its quirks, overall I found my lunch satisfying and would have no qualms returning.  I'd give it a solid 3.5 rating, but since Yelp digs whole numbers, I'm going with three stars until I can sample more items from their extensive menu."}
{"text":"The floor hadn't been swept in days. The bartender was a young Hispanic lady with a half shirt on. She had to finish her telephone conversation for 7 minutes while I stood waiting. I ordered steak tacos for $2 like the menu says. She said they are $2.50. Ordered 5 with cheese and sour cream added. She asked if I wanted tomatoes and i said no, yet she spent 30 seconds looking to add tomatoes. I told her again no tomatoes. She totaled me up, $18.46. I got $1.00 change back and she said it was only $1.00 because they didn't have any quarters. The shittiest service I've ever had. The nastiest trashiest place I have ever been into. When I got my order I checked and there are three sour creams. I asked why I got three when I paid for 5. I will be calling the owner shortly.  Update on this. I get back and share the tacos with my Manager, come to find the cheese that we were charged $0.50 a piece for, was not on any of the tacos. Spare yourself the trouble and go to Los Gemelos or El Jalapeño instead. Cleaner places with better service."}
