{"text":"My daughter, her boyfriend and I had a fantastic dinner here last night. Both of them had the Chicken Cavetalli and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was plated well, looked delicious and yet she couldn't get over how much it reminded her of comfort food. The rack of lamb was wonderful. The crust and sauce complimented the meat fantastically. The risotto and asparagus were done perfectly. As wonderful as the meal was the staff was even better. Couldn't imagine a more pleasant, knowledgeable and accommodating server then Elaina. Thank you Blue for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"As a major foodie, it's hard to pick one place as my favorite restaurant, but this might be it! I've never had a bad experience here. Their food is great (I often wind up ordering an assortment of appetizers because I just can't decide on one dish) and I can't think of a place where you can get better drinks or friendlier service! The bartenders in particular are wonderful and I can't speak highly enough about them. As a wine lover, they have a great selection and I often just split a bottle with whomever I'm dining with, but their martins are of course perfection - I especially love their cream soda martini! This is a great place for celebrations/ meeting up with friends/ date nights."}
{"text":"What a great place for Friday night happy hour!  Great martinis and complimentary Sushi.  Great atmosphere where you can gather with friends for go to a quiet table and enjoy a meal.  Great friendly service!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner. Our server was great and the food was tasty and well prepared. Reminded me of Atlanta fare - prepared with thoughtfulness, fresh ingredients, the right amount of savory. Desserts put it over the top!"}
{"text":"Outstanding all around.  There's a martini for everyone in their drink list.  They serve Chimay Blue and White (among other brands, but who bothers to look at those when there's CHIMAY to be had?).  I cannot recommend the marinated hanger steak highly enough and my wife was really thrilled with her maryland crab cakes.  The steak's sauce had a great sweet taste at first which turned into a perfect amount of spiciness in short order.  The dessert menu made up for its small quantity with quality.  I'd wager that everything on there is just as rich and flavorful as my cobbler sampler or my wife's chocolate mousse cake.

Our server was very attentive as well.  He managed to be right there when we needed something but otherwise knew to leave us to our dining.  Too often, I've experienced either the absent waiter or the helicopter waiter.  This guy was the perfect goldilocks waiter--just the right amount of attentiveness.

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is really a trendy/ upscale local bar with a small restaurant attached. It is randomly located in a strip mall about 10 minutes off Mcknight Road in the north, North Hills. I have been twice and both times just left really confused on what this place is supposed to be.

To me, the interior is designed sort of like a Carnival Cruise Ship - sort of trendy, but also a little bright and cheesy too. The bar was full of locals both times and both times, the restaurant tables were only us and one other table in use.  I guess a lot of people go here for the jazz performances, but we didn't do those.

The service was attentive and fine both times. The food is upscale Pittsburgh (pastas, seafood, meats) with average serving size. The quality was fine but definitely not memorable. The price is pretty upscale - trending to the upper $20s/ low $30s for entrees. 

I am thinking this place must really be for the upscale local jazz lovers because while it wasn't bad, I would much rather go to a place like Willow for a more intimate ambiance and higher quality food for the price."}
{"text":"Our food was well presented, service excellent, and the ambience was conducive to our intimate evening."}
{"text":"I got a some drinks here with a couple friends! 

Pros: Chic interior, well stocked bar, friendly bartender, extensive drink list

Cons: Strip mall location 

Well be back for some food!"}
{"text":"I ordered the House special and had to send it back. The meat pieces were tough and dry, so overcooked, they were barely edible. The second order was cooked perfect, it was as if the first order was an attempt to send out leftovers from lunch since the restaurant was closed for a private affair when we arrived. The burger had chunks of cartilage and bone. Very disappointed how poor the food has become. I have no idea if it's a different owner or head Chef but I'm sure it's one or the other. You can't charge $18-$35 a plate without a good staff and expect to survive."}
{"text":"I attended their Diva Night series for years (which was cancelled), but I went back this week to try their food.  I was pleasantly surprised, our meal was delicious.  My favorite thing to order is the scallops, and they were delicious.  We split a Brussels Sprouts salad, which was also very good.  Our server, Shanna, was the best.  Their wine list is better than most, and I picked an Italian Negroamaro which went well with my meal."}
{"text":"We dined there last night. I cannot tell you how underwhelmed we were by everything. Ordered the tuna - the server asked what temp we would like it cooked. We said medium. Well clearly it was not an option. Not an unusual dish, seared tuna loin that was clearly intended to be served by rare, which it was. Why ask if it only comes one way? The tuna was clearly of high quality, but there was no attempt to season it - it was just warmed on the outside and sesame seeds were slapped on the sides. It was painfully under seasoned and uninspired. The beet salad, a dish that could, with very little effort be creative and delicious... It was not. A pile of arugula, sliced beets, a thumbprint of chèvre and a dressing that was without any impact on the dish as a whole. The lobster pasta with cream sauce tasted as if no thought or creativity was ever considered. Almost every dish on the menu had cream or cheese. Are we in Wisconsin? I wonder if the \"chef\", and I use the term loosely, has a dairy addiction and might consider a 12 step program. The door in the front lets the cold winter air in, making the entire mediocre experience downright unpleasant. The service was slow, but no more than OK. Even  after asking our waiter to do something about the door twice, we were told that sometimes the one door gets locked, but on this particular day it was a fire code infraction. Odd on how sometimes the door can be locked and some days it can't - laws are funny that way, I guess. After two comments about the door, a good server would probably ask if we would like to move, mid-meal as a number of tables were vacated during our meal, but that didn't happen. Perhaps thee server would have the manager come speak to us about our discomfort, but that didn't happen either. I did not notice anyone in the restaurant, again I use the term loosely, who even appeared to be a manager. We will not be back and I suggest that you eat at the DMV instead. At least there the service and food are probably better. Don't waste your time, unless you like painfully sweet martinis, again, I use that term loosely too. What a wasted of space."}
{"text":"Terrible new owners and menu.
BEWARE ALL NEW MENU AND STAFF AND OWNER 
Nothing like the old blue 

We set up a birthday table with glassware , gifts and balloons . 

First of all our drinks were botched up and ice was put into a sidecar . Drinks were remade but weren't up to par 

THe Waitress didn't know much as it was her second day there . She couldn't answer our questions ....

We ordered 4 apps and one had a custard flan  on it but we ordered the jalapeño corn waffle . We summoned the manager and she said ....you enjoyed it ...

NO WE DIDNT, WE TASTED IT AND REALIZED WE DIDNT GET WHAT WE ORDERED.

No apology given at all, no correction made

So we decided to spare ordering overpriced entrees and leave. We packed up our birthday glassware and the butch manager who was looking over our shoulders grabbed my arm and said \" you are not taking my glasses .\"

She pulled them out of the bag and said....oh they aren't mine!

However she didn't apologize for her faux pas 

She is coarse , arrogant and classless.

We miss the old BLUE."}
{"text":"Seafood Pasta - excellent
Crab Cakes - looked good
Sashimi Tuna on black rice -excellent

However, I had the sirloin steak and it was disappointing. Prepared medium rare, it should have been tender, but it was a bit too chewy and had a grainy texture."}
{"text":"Great new spot in the north hills. Awesome martinis, Cocktails, wine and beer. The food is also very good. However, the prices are crazy for the portions. I only go here during happy hour or with a good coupon. I wish things were about 30-40% cheaper, so I could go more often. Because it's really good, just too pricey."}
{"text":"Happy hour specials from 5-7 are great with $5 select martinis, wines, and appetizers. The Berry Blast martini was so tasty!  We sat at the bar and Kim the bartender was so friendly and nice and offered great service. 

We then wanted to have dinner so we were seated in the dining area. The food was awesome!  I had the Chilean Sea Bass with mushroom risotto and my friend had the Lobster Linguine, both were fantastic. We also the soup of the day, which was a shrimp and pork wonton soup...yum! For dessert we had the chocolate mousse cake and the cobbler flight (strawberry and blueberry were the flavors) DELICIOUS! Our server was also very attentive and on point with every thing we needed. 

All in all, great drinks, food and service! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Only came here for the bar area - no food. They had an impressive martini list and lots of bottled beers. I enjoyed the Bermuda Triangle; Absolute Peach Vodka, Ameretto, Banana Liqueur, Orange Juice, Pineapple Juice and Cranberry Juice. It was well made, not too strong but not too weak. The juices definitely helped make it delicious. They also had Samuel Smith Nut Brown Ale in bottles, which is one of my favorite beers. This place is definitely a neighborhood bar, all the locals seemed to know each other. The crowd was in the 30-45 range."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised by this place - first off the location of this place suggests that it's going to be awful. It's in a strip mall behind a DMV testing center. You can enjoy watching those 16-something year old try their luck at parallel parking - it's actually quite entertaining. 

But most of the shops in this strip mall look deserted, like they've been closed down, so when I arrived I was a bit concerned. I went in and while it wasn't overly crowded, there were people at the bar and a few people getting dinner. 

My friend and I ordered an array of appetizers, the gorgonzola hummus, lobster risotto, shrimp and corn fritters, and scallops. This was more than enough for the 2 of us. Everything was fantastic with the exception of the shrimp and corn fritters - they weren't bad, but I wasn't impressed by them - just meh. But the gorgonzola hummus, risotto, and scallops were very tasty. I think I'm still in shock by this place - b/c I wasn't expecting the food to be sooo good. 

If you don't live in the North Hills this is probably out of the way, but if you're in the area you should definitely check this place out - you won't be disappointed. Oh and I got the cream soda cocktail - which tasted exactly like cream soda!!!"}
{"text":"If you like frozen seafood that smells and tastes fishy - then this is the place for you!

I should have known to stay away when I called for reservations and they said that they couldn't get us in till 8:30 - to only stop in and see that they weren't very busy at all.  Interesting start.

THEN when we showed up - we waited several minutes for the hostess to stop talking with her co-workers in the back so that she could grace us with her presence and find us a table.

The dining experience was the worst I have had in a LONG time.  Perhaps ever.

For the money I expect an excellent dining experience with seafood that doesn't smell fishy and taste like it came from a freezer.  Perhaps if my drink wasn't so watered down I would have had enough alcohol in me so that I didn't become nauseous after my meal.

When two people dining at a restaurant don't eat 90% of their dinner I would think a manager would stop by to find out what was wrong.

Live and learn I guess."}
{"text":"Apparently this place prefers its regulars over new business. A party of people were using some loud and profane language, something I didn't feel like listening to or think I should at a martini lounge, so I asked them politely to keep it down a little bit. They complained to the manager, who told us that the people are regulars and WE WERE THE ONES WHO HAD TO LEAVE! So unless you want to take the backseat to the owners and managers friends and have to listen to their profanity, save your time and money."}
{"text":"Like the name...Blue...an interesting restaurant.  Enjoyed our visit.  A big drink menu with lots of martini's and beers.  Decent wine selection by the glass.  

But the main reason for the visit was Diva Tuesday...Jazz..Female vocalists...Jessica Lee was great!  Have music every Tuesday.  Thought it was from 9 to 11 so showed up at 9...missed first hour cause it is 8 to 10...bummer.   Another couple showed up at 10 and thought the same time and found out the kitchen closed at 10... they were able to get some hummus.  

Sampled two appetizers - the hummus and bruschetta with basil/pesto.  Both were very good.

Service was OK, busy and noticed the table next to us had to have the bill corrected for to many drinks...probably a honest mistake but...I always wonder about this type of mistake!"}
{"text":"Happy hour $5martini and app list is of course a nice treat but I always enjoy treating myself to Blue regardless. Drinks are great, the bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different but BJ was not in the mood to drive very far.  Blue was the perfect compromise.  The restaurant is located in a fairly ugly old strip mall.  Someone needs to tell the owner of the building that it's time to paint and then repave the parking lot.  We forged ahead in spite of the exterior.

We were greeted right away and led to a roomy big booth.  Pretty much everything in the restaurant is blue except the orange fish covered seat cushions.  Our server greeted us right away and took our drink orders.

BJ got the Maryland Crab Cakes.  He thought they were tasty, but he was not in love with them.  I got the lobster risotto from the appetizer menu.  The lobster seemed a little overcooked but I was pleasantly surprised by the amount.  Also the risotto had excellent flavor.  And the portion size was a very nice.  

For dessert, we decided to try the white chocolate mousse, with a tiny dollop of chocolate cayenne creme brulee, and dark rich chocolate cake.  We were both impressed with this dessert.  

We enjoyed our experience and will definitely visit, again."}
{"text":"There was steel wool in my mashed potatoes. I hadn't noticed until it was in my mouth. I didn't complain because I was with friends. Totally freaked me out and could have been dangerous.

Otherwise, the food was good, but I'm hesitant to go back."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by its location, next to the dollar store & doors down from the DMV. And don't be afraid to call BS on the hostess who says they are \"holding tables for reservations\" on a half empty restaurant. (OpenTable showed availability within 15 min of our arrival)

The food is excellent. Downtown quality, reasonably priced. Great \"martinis\" (just shaken drinks in a martini glass but still good with tons of choices)

Best brussels sprouts salad ever.

Nice selection of meat & seafood."}
{"text":"This is a nice little joint that is unexpectedly in a strip mall in the north hills.  I used to go here often when my buddy was the owner and chef.  I hadn't been here in a while, however it used to be a regular spot.  I was there last night and they've made a few changes, but the menu and space is basically the same.  They are building another private dining room which will hold up to 34 which is good for business functions they also have another smaller private room which holds about a dozen.  The space itself is pretty warm.  It finds the balance between \"fine\" dining and neighborhood bar pretty well.  They have a few booths a relatively large dining room and a big bar with a couple plasmas and a jukebox.  The menu is pretty much the same as it has been for years, however they've added a \"tapas\" menu.  It's not really tapas more like small appetizers, but a nice addition.  We started with a nice cheese platter with room temperature asiago and a nice balsamic.  There were also a nice selection of olives and a good salami and prosciutto.  The last few times I tried a charcuterie plate the items were ice cold, it's nice to see that these folks now how to serve this appetizer.  We then tried a scallop/shrimp appetizer, which was okay.  The shrimp was a bit charred and the scallop was cooked well, but relatively flavorless.  The soba noodle salad was just okay, this dish was probably my least favorite.  We also tried a delicious duck confit ravioli which was my favorite of the night.   A really nice dish on  a fall night.  The duck filling was delicious and the ravioli was cooked al dente'.  Finally, Lisa and I shared a filet entree.  The filet was cooked perfectly and the risotti was very nice.  Too often when I order risotti it's \"mushy\", however this was a nice compliment to the filet.  Kim is a good bartender and I've been friends with him for years.  He makes a really strong martini, so be careful.  The wine selection leaves a bit too be desired.   I suggest you stick to the martini list, you won't be disappointed.  This is a nice little spot hidden away in an unassuming place."}
{"text":"This place is worth a try.  The menu is varied but not so large to be overwhelming.   I have never had a bad meal.  The martini menu is wonderful!  The chocolate cappuccino is, my favorite.   The atmosphere is modern and clean.   You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"The #1 seared Ahi is out of this world!  Started with the amazing roasted beet salad.   Enjoyed Pink Poodle martini and Halloween cider martini.  

Festive and friendly atmosphere; My second time here and I love Blue!"}
