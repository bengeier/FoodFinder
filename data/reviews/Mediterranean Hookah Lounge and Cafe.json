{"text":"I am not a regular Hookah enthusiast, but Mediterranean Hookah Lounge and Cafe was definitely a step up from previous Hookah bars I had been to. Rather then being stuffy and full of Hookah haze, the venue was pretty spacious and vibrant. On Friday they do Karaoke which was a lot of fun. Additionally, they have so many flavors to choose from and are extremely helpful when it comes to setting everything up!"}
{"text":"Warm and relaxing atmosphere to chill with friends.  Friday fish fry and Old Fashioneds are the best in town."}
{"text":"Very relaxed atmosphere, and the food was good, but our service was soooooo slooooooow! The location is also somewhat off-putting (and hard to find if you've never been there) being as it seems to be literally in the middle of a trailer park. But, once you're inside it's a very chill place, nice to have a hookah and some food."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Hookah Lounge!  I have been coming here once or twice a month for a few years now, almost always on Friday and Saturday nights to watch belly dancing.  

Food is good, I usually go for the Friday Fish or Shrimp Scampi.  Once I had a prime rib special that was also terrific.

The martinis are pricey, usually $7 to $8, but they don't skimp on alcohol, especially when Billy is behind the bar :)  One or two and I'm good for the night!  They also have drink specials, like $4 Old Fashioneds, or $3.50 Leinie's pints.

I tried a Hookah for the first time a few weeks ago, and it's quite enjoyable.  It is tobacco but it doesn't give you that scorched lung feel, the taste is great and the smoke dissapates.  Four of us shared a mango hookah and it seemed to last forever, though by the end I was a little tired of the flavor, but mango isn't my favorite to start with.

I went one Sunday on for a Packer game, and it was a nice little crowd, plus free shots when the Packers score a touchdown.

I've never been for Karaoke, but that's another popular draw.

The location is kinda random (in the middle of a trailor park!)  but it sure beats the overcrowding and limited parking downtown.

LGBTQ friendly."}
{"text":"I haven't had the food there. I came here with a buddy on a karoake wedsnday night. Karoake is always fun. But the place was boring and weird crowd. I will have to try a different hookah lounge. There aren't many. But I will have to pass on this one next time."}
{"text":"coolest place ever! so glad that there is a hookah bar in Madison! And it's (in my opinion) in a super-neat location, on top of a secluded hill! The hookah is great - they have many flavors to choose from. I only wish they offered some sort of hookah happy hour special. A hookah bar I used to frequent in Champaign, IL offers half-priced hookahs from 5-8pm, which I think is a great idea. I wasn't so sold on the food - I ordered a greek salad and it was DRENCHED in dressing (note to self: order dressings on the side :-)). The drinks are great - especially the winter/seasonal hot chocolate with smirnoff MARSHMALLOW - sounds so weird but was super good. The ambiance is great, although it is a little cold in the backroom. On weekends they have a belly dancer. I plan on taking every friend who comes to visit me, to this place. It's truly unique, and there is a separate bar attached with frequent karaoke! How fun!"}
{"text":"Please give this place a try, you will definitely be pleasantly surprised. 
I was amazed by the delicious food, relaxing and classy atmosphere, and the excellent service. If you are looking for a somewhat hidden treasure, this place is really it."}
{"text":"Never eat here if you like your moneys worth.  The single worst place I have ever eat period and dollar for dollar.  The grape leaf appetizers we actually disgusting and I eat some crazy shit.  The two dishes me and my gf had were so bland.  Dessert was the worst, we only got it too hopefully redeem some part of meal.  $8 crunchy tiramsu is what we got, frozen and bland also.  If a chesse dessert is frozen that means the cheap bastard use a watered down version of actual cream.  Literally a dining joke.  I hope this place goes out of business as it is a crime that people have to pay for this."}
{"text":"I went here on new years eve, had never been here before, they had some special for NYE, I got the pork tenderloin was pretty good, came with a ton of potato's. They were three smaller tenderloins wrapped in bacon. There was a belly dancer dancing while we were eating that was balancing candles on her head and stuff. was pretty interesting. when we were leaving they were bring out swards and fire or something. We got a hookah, lasts about a half hour. They were out of mint chacolate chip so we got mango-watermelon mix that was pretty good.  When we were leaving there was kareokee going on in the bar area but didn't stay for that."}
{"text":"Very good food, decent drinks, but the hookahs are the big draw. I don't really smoke, but I love the rose-flavored tobacco drawn through the big water pipes. Very mild and it's supposed to be all natural. Mideastern cuisine is their specialty, but the duck is very tender."}
{"text":"Very inviting wait staff and such a warming atmosphere here at Mediterranean! Great for a group gathering or just a small get together of two. Great drink specials and with a late night appetizer menu you can't go wrong. Gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"Given the location and the history of this place, you may have really low expectations.  That helps, but the food is actually quite good.  Friday night's ubiquitous fish fry, of course, but they have a respectable menu of Mediterranean specialties as well.  I'm fond of the Shwarma Platter, myself.  Some nights they have belly dancers for entertainment- that's really fun to watch.  

What's a trip to a hookah lounge without an actual hookah?  Try the peach/mango, it's amazingly smooth and flavorful.  I'd never tried it before and was amazed at how uncigarette-like it is."}
{"text":"We really had a good time here!  Had a few beers,  a bottle of Riesling, and cherry flavored hookah for $80 before tip. 

The hookahs are $22 and refills 1/2 off. 

They even had fish fry for $12 and by the signs of the full dining room,  it had to be pretty good.

Belly dancing was at 9:30pm but only in a certain area and only for 15 min. We're sad to say we missed it. 

Staff are very nice and the karaoke looked like a blast. Definitely will come back and check out what the rest of the place has to offer!"}
{"text":"Awesome DJ, Bartenders, drinks, and music selection. I was impressed by it all. The pineapple kush hooka was AWESOME... It gave us all a buzz"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. Belly dancing on the lounge side was great.

The bar side is a good place to karaoke.

The location is strange as it is basically on the edge of a trailer park, but don't let that stop you because inside it is nice."}
{"text":"Wow, who knew? Great Mediterranean food on a hill in a trailer park overlooking the Beltline. Excellent service, great belly dancing, hookahs on almost every table. Highlights included chicken kabob with fresh grilled veggies and chicken on bed of incredible couscous, Mediterranean pasta and falafel. Only negative was they were sold out off eggplant parm from the night before!"}
{"text":"This place is such a trip. 

I've been here many a Friday/Saturday night to watch some belly dancing (every Friday and Saturday at 8 and 9:30pm) with some friends. The dancers are usually very good, though I have been disappointed on occasion. The dancers dance throughout the lounge, and it's pretty chill, so if watching belly dancing is not your thing, you can kind of ignore it and continue your conversation/hookah smoking/drinking. There are a lot of hookah flavors to choose from, and there are several decent drink specials ($4 old fashioneds on Fridays). My boyfriend got a burger there the other night and said it was really good. 

What's really interesting about this place is the fact that it is 2 bars in one building, with two completely different vibes. There's the hookah lounge, which is a slightly more upscale-feeling restaurant-type space. Then, just down the hall, is a divey karaoke bar that definitely feels more like it belongs in the trailer park in which the building is actually located. I say this latter comment with no disrespect, because I have had a lot of fun in that bar. The karaoke screen is in a corner, so you don't have to look at other people when you sing, if you're a little embarrassed/nervous (as I of course was). There's usually a pretty congenial feel, and the karaoke MC is funny and  welcoming."}
{"text":"First experience. Great wait staff, excellent atmosphere, and really comfy couches in the lounge area! More upscale than most hookah bars I've visited, but very worth it."}
{"text":"I should really give no stars.  We went in to the place and headed for the dining rom, which we think was closed.  We went in to the bar area where four or five people were at the bar, and tables had silverware rolled up on them.  Not ONE word was spoken to us, and the bartender appeared to be busy talking/drinking with the patrons.  We stood there for a while, again, not ONE word.  Not, \"are you dining with us?\" Or even, \"hello.\"  We couldn't figure out if they were serving food, and it was SO strange, we walked out.  I don't know if they serve food there or not.  Would have tried it, but when no employee can even get off their dead-ass to greet you....really bad service and bad food can't be far behind.  Never ate or drank a thing!!  We used to go here regularly a couple of years ago and thought we'd go again.  We know the folks who hang there, no big deal.  But I do not have a clue if food is served anymore."}
{"text":"I really can't believe this place has the rating it does.

I went to meet some friends, have a few drinks, and smoke some hookah. My first impression walking in was that it looked like someone lived there and literally just installed a bar into part of it. It's cramped, poorly lit, and the acoustics were just miserable. 

The karaoke would have been laughable, but was really more depressing than anything. A couple tiny screens shoved into a corner with the absolute worst sound system my ears have ever witnessed, and a poor selection of songs. Seriously, the twenty dollar speaker system hooked up to my computer would have been louder and sounded better. Maybe it was the \"DJ\" (I use that title loosely) not mixing the sound right, but either way it was far from good.

Drinks are insanely priced. I get that you'll pay around $9 for a single cocktail at a bar downtown, but really you're paying in part for the location and ambiance of the place. $9 for a single cocktail here is absurd, and I can't believe people willingly pay it. There's also a very slim selection of alcohol all around, so if you have specific tastes in what you drink (that doesn't include rail vodka and domestic beers), it's likely you will be disappointed going here. The bartenders are pretty stingy on the liquor too.

Speaking of the bartenders, while they were very nice people, I've gotten better service at a shoulder-to-shoulder packed bar downtown on a friday night than I did at this place. There couldn't have been more than ten people standing at the bar - something the two bartenders could have easily handled - but I still waited close to 10 minutes at times just to get a drink. And on one occasion I had to order the same thing 4 different times because the guy I talked to either didn't hear me or kept forgetting, so I waited even longer. Many times I would see them piddling about very slowly, grabbing orders at a snails pace and chatting casually with patrons while I stood about waiting to get served.

Hookah was $22 for a single coal, which isn't awful since it is assumed you are splitting it with other people, but it goes pretty quick, and that racks up quickly if you keep ordering new ones. It would have been nice for the initial hookah to cost $22 and then \"refills\" cost $15 or something, but whatever.

TL;DR - If you're looking for a hookah bar, there are probably better ones out there. If you're looking for a karaoke bar, I am sure there are better ones out there. If you're looking for a regular old bar to drink it, avoid this place because almost every other bar in the Madison area is better."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, entertainment and friendly staff.  John was very knowledgeable of the menu friendly and attentive.   Great atmosphere! And they have karaoke!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for a friend's birthday. It's a little off-putting when you first come in. We had to cut through a very un-Mediterranean bar to get to the actual resturant. The food and martinis was good, the owner was very attentive, and the entertainment was fun to watch (just make sure you're not in her way when she spins!). Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to try a hookah."}
{"text":"This is a great Middle Eastern Restaurant venue in Madison, It offers no just delicious Middle Eastern food but also has live belly dancing shows.  I was a little taken back by this at first, but i must say it seams like the people dining really enjoy the authenticity of having a show.  They also have hookah, which is a lounge area that you can site and smoke a hookah in the lounge.  This is the only middle eastern restaurant offering the live shows and hookah area as well as the middle eastern food prepared by owners from Lebanon."}
{"text":"This place is pretty interesting. I am a fan of odd bars, so obviously I was pretty stoked to come here for a friend's birthday. She describes it as \"gay hookah mediterranean tranny trailer park karaoke\" and I can honestly say I saw every part of that description in living color at this wonderfully divey hole in the wall. The bartender was cool, the karaoke was in full swing, and the establishment was most definitely located in a trailer park. Rock on, Madison.

Can't comment on the cafe part, but I've heard it's pretty good so I'll probably check that out sometime."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. This place is located in a Mobile home area, but it has a lot to offer! There is one side that is a bar area, more for drinking. The other side, the 'hookah side,' is much more classy. My boyfriend and I almost left before we realized there was a dinner section as well. One Hookah is $22 for one flavor. The food came very fast. There are belly dancers on Fridays and Saturdays! We had the 'Double Apple' flavor and it as great! Server was a little slow, but she was new. All together is was a great experience and I will go back!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  I've been coming here every couple of weeks now for about a year. It has become my home bar because everyone there is just so lovely. Billy is our usual bartender and I absolutely adore him--if you're there, I recommend the Pomegranate Martini--MMMM!!!!

If Tommy's bartending on the restaurant side (which happens on Friday nights, along with live belly dance shows--awesome!), be sure to order an Old Fashioned--he does 'em right!

There's been a lot of work done to this place in the last year--new scenery on the bar side, new toilet seats in the ladies bathroom (see original review below), and new karaoke DJs (Jamie and Trista are a HUGE part of why I go).

A word on the karaoke:  the first time I went to this place, the DJ was a bit scary and slightly offensive--no good for a newbie.  I haven't seen him since, however, and the new DJs are FANTASTIC.  The music isn't the newest, but that's not a bad thing.  I think my favorite part about the karaoke here is the crowd--although it's ever-changing, they are always supportive and a great time.  It's not uncommon to see everyone get up and start to dance along to the livelier tunes.

Want my humble opinion on the hookah itself?  Go for classic French Vanilla or juicy Fruit Punch. Stay clear of Limoncello (hardly any flavor) and Double Apple (sticks with you long after you want it to lol).

I always bring new and old friends here--sometimes for dinner on Fridays, and sometimes to just crash after a long Saturday of hiking. I was hard on this place in the beginning, but I'm SO glad to end up here at the end of a long week.  

SNIPPETS FROM MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:

This place was kind of like falling into bizarro-world.  I love hookah, so I will definitely go back,   but probably not on karaoke night.

The building itself is situated on the edge of a trailer park.  It's very David Lynch-esque when you're driving up the winding access road (77 Sirloin Strip--yeah, really--like steak). When you walk in, it looks like the kind of dive bar you'd imagine Kenny Rogers must frequent. The clientele represent all ages and walks of life. The bartenders are quite friendly, but I got charged $14 for a double.  When that happens, I stop buying drinks. $14 for a double is ridiculous. $14 for a double in the middle of a trailer park? That's just effing crazy. (**UPDATE: That bartender must've been VERY new because that has never happened again: drinks are anywhere between $4 and $10 for the swanky martinis, etc.**)

I did really enjoy sitting in the easy chairs and hitting that hookah. Individual mouth thingies are provided (hooray for being sanitary!). Next time, I'll sit in the dining room, away from the bar.  And next time, I'll pre-game so I'm not paying for drinks that cost way too much.

One last thing--the bathrooms are a little scary. Doors don't quite lock, and as my friend said, the toilet seats look like they got into a fight with some battery acid.  I'd like them to take all my drink money and fix up the bathrooms a little. lol"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this gem accidentally when I first moved to the area.  It quickly became my regular go-to bar.  The chill atmosphere, great hookahs, and friendly staff are among my favorite things.  Karaoke is always a blast, and the food is excellent!  Every time I have an out of town guest, I make sure to bring them in too!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. This is one of my favorite places in Madison. Ignore the surrounding area and the look of the building from the outside. The hookah is amazing. I've been hookah'ing at home for three years and I can never seem to get it as good as their's. Their food on the weekends is also amazing. I don't usually care for the appetizers during the week, though. The atmosphere is prefect. It's so relaxing and comfortable. One of my favorite things about this place is the belly dancing! Anya Sofia is the best! I go every time she dances! The owner is a really great friendly guy too. Overall this place is great!"}
{"text":"The fact that this place is located on Sirloin Strip on the edge of a trailer park that overlooks the Beltline highway can be misleading.

It's a good spot for Mediterranean food (at least in Madison). Service is pretty attentive and if you are lucky you will smoke a hookah and see a belly dancer. The other half of the building is a divey karaoke bar with a much more local crowd.

Food - 3.5 stars
Atmosphere / uniqueness / service - 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Executive summary:  a little on the dive bar side but recent renovations have given the interior a causal classy feel.  Good food, options available for vegetarians.  A little tricky for gluten-sensitive folks.  My go to spot for a hookah.  Restrooms aren't the best but are better than they were and are always clean and well stocked.  Decent amount of parking around the building.

This is not the type of place I would normally frequent.  I'd seen this place, up on the hill, as I drove past on the beltline a million times.  So what made me finally come here?  My instructor was belly dancing on the restaurant side one Friday night and I wanted to support her.  Why do I return?  This place feels like home now and I want to support the great people at Hookah, restaurant and bar side.  And for the karaoke!

Belly dancing is featured Friday and Saturday nights in the restaurant side.  They have tables and booths where you can eat dinner while watching the featured dancer.  The menu is a mix of Mediterranean and American dishes, mostly small plates and sharables.  I think the shimp flatbread is my favorite.  My friend raves about the baba ganoush.  Although there are several vegetarian options there's little on the menu for gluten-sensitive folks unless you eat meat without bread, skip the pita served with the hummus and baba ganoush, etc.  But if you're gluten sensitive I'm sure you know all these tricks.  If gluten doesn't bother you the pistachio cake is AMAZING.  

They also have a bar and an area with leather couches on the restaurant side if you prefer to relax and sip a beverage or smoke a hookah.  Drink specials include Old Fashioned on Friday and Bacardi or Captain mixers on Saturday.  The have several delicious specialty martinis as well.

After dinner and the show head on over to the karaoke bar side.  If Billy's behind the bar say \"hi\" from me.  He's always got a smile on his face.  You can't help but smile back.  They are working on updating the karaoke selection but most of the crowd tend toward the tried-and-true favorites anyway.  I've found certain DJs are more friendly and interactive than others but they all do a great job of getting new singers into the rotation.

Smaller tables dot the space, plus plenty of bar stools and even a few leather couches and chairs for relaxing between songs.  Grab a drink, smoke a hookah, and enjoy the singers.

A word of warning in the restroom, the stall doors don't quite lock.  But they've always been clean and well stocked when I've been there.  The one time they were running low on TP I let one of the bartenders know and a new roll arrived pronto!

Parking is decent, located around the building.  The restaurant is located in the middle of a trailer park so as you're driving up the hill past all the trailers, yes, you're headed the right direction.  It's an odd location but come inside, sit back, enjoy a hookah, and relax."}
{"text":"I had high hopes but sorry I can't recommend this place. The baba ghanouj was ok, the rest was fair at best and the fatayar was burned. We were literally ignored by our server the last 20 minutes when trying to leave. She wouldn't make eye contact and our family stood for six minutes by our chairs indicating we had to go.   The server went into the kitchen and never came back and I had to just put some money on the table. We left without ever receiving a bill."}
{"text":"Lovely cosy place!! Surprisingly good hookah and most importantly very helpful staff and welcoming owners!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  I wish we had one like this in Minneapolis.  They offer a full-service bar, delicious mediterranean food, plush couches and chairs to sit on as well as a wide variety of sheesha to choose from.  

The location is a little odd since it is in an auto mall but once you get inside, it is completely worth it!

Check them out for something a little different to do :)"}
{"text":"There's a lot to love about the Hookah Lounge and Cafe once you get past it's tough exterior shell. (Seriously close one eye on the drive up the hill no matter which way you go and avoid looking around too closely as you go inside. Once through the door, eyes open. Take it all in.) [1] But let's be honest, a lot of things have a tough exterior and delicious insides. 

M&Ms
Star Fruit
Cornucopias 
the list goes on

I suggest you start your evening in the bar area. The Friday I was there, there were some inexpensive drink specials, and the space is so large that even when I arrived around 6 it hadn't filled up. You're not going to get the full experience sitting at the bar, so after a bev or two (you can take unfinished drinks with) walk over to the cafe part. There's another bar (win!) and a smattering of tables. The menu has a number of options sure to please anyone's propensity for Mediterranean. I got the shaved lamb plate and couldn't polish it off, it's seriously huge. Your meal will start with some pita and Zatar (look it up) which is an uber authentic way to get things going. 

Didn't stay for the hookah or for the belly dancing. I get super uncomfortable when those ladies get close. Personal space please, personal space. 

[1] Don't actually close one eye. That would be dangerous. Unless you're trained."}
{"text":"I like this place. The hookah is obviously the best part. We've been here several times for karaoke and it's usually pretty fun.

The first time we came was for a birthday and we had a blast! We got a hookah and it was awesome. It's something fun and you don't get to do something like that anywhere else! We had a blast.

We've been there for karaoke a few times and met some amazing people! It was really fun for the most part. It's a little \"cliquey\" in that if they don't know you, the same people will sing 5 times in a row before you get to go. But that's ok! If you don't mind waiting. Overall it's a fun place and cool if you're looking for something different to do. Great for groups as well. You can come casual or you can get a little dressed up and either way you'll fit right on.

Strange location. Not walkable for most people but if you have a DD or can call a Lyft, it's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"My friends and I love coming here because they have comfortable couches where large groups can gather to enjoy drinks and hookah. We love singing karaoke and having a ball with the crowd!!! Most people are so supportive and jump in on the experience which makes it so much more fun. The  bartender Jackson, is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very strange location for a bar (almost in a trailer park), but totally worth it. I always have fun at this bar. Low key dining side with a dark cool vibe, sometimes acoustic music or belly dancers. The bar side has karaoke and a lounge area. I would recommend visiting this bar at least once to check it out for yourself- especially if you like hookah!"}
{"text":"Was craving hookah last night and falafel. Used to frequent a place out of town that had very authentic Mediterranean cuisine and over 100 tobacco flavors/combinations to choose from. This place made me long for my former city. I will give it props for delicious and well seasoned falafel, however I can't look past the dingy interior, overpriced hookah and inedible fatayer. The menu was also extremely limited with only 3 red wine selections. Pours weren't generous considering the $8 price tag for a lowly ménage a trois."}
{"text":"I was not sure what to expect when I came to this Hookah lounge. The location is a little odd. It is right next to a trailer park...but the restaurant is really nice inside. Their hookah is actually well done and the mint was good. There is karaoke which has some regulars that are actually pretty decent. They also have a full bar and a nice bartender. The food was surprisingly good. I have found that when a location tries to do too many things they almost always fail at something, but not here. If you are looking to meet women though this is not the place..."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the location when I arrived. It's a bit away from the roaring college town however I've got to say it's a hidden gem. The taste of the food was phenomenal as well as the array of choices they have. It offers a little something different to a bar town full of fast finger food. The hookah exceeded my expectations, the choices of flavors they had were very good. The taste was also very good. Customer service was by far one of the best. Gabe himself made sure to take care of my group and provided us with insight into what to order. Definitely recommend."}
