{"text":"Very disappointed.  Ordered on a Friday night and pizza showed up 2 hours later.  It was so cold it was barely edible.  Disappointed in this expensive pizza that did not live up to our expectations whatsoever."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza in Chagrin, even if it does sometimes employ questionable characters and juvenile delinquents. That's why we get takeout rather than delivery. That, and their absolutely delicious pizza. Try the spicy sauce."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland... and considering so many other places in America suck at making Pizza... among the best in the world!"}
{"text":"i'm only reviewing one specialty pizza: The Vegginator with spicy sauce. OMG this pizza is life! The tangy kick of the banana peppers combined with the spiciness of the red sauce, plus the sweet crunch of the onions, the rich flavor of black olives and mushrooms, and the warm juiciness of the fresh tomatoes, creates the perfect taste explosion. The crust is the ideal amount of foundation for the toppings and cheese, with just the right amount of crisp, and not at all greasy. I can't rave about this hearty, healthy, delicious pizza enough. I wish there were more locations but lucky for me I have one really close to my office!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area. We've tried multiple places. Really fast service. Only downside is no delivery."}
{"text":"We love their Pizza's, we have tried a few different Pizza's they are all really good! I was surprised at the offer of three different red sauces, sweet,, spicy and traditional. A very nice menu including dessert, try the funnel cakes. The sizes of their pizza's are much bigger than most places, a large is LARGE.  Very glad we found this place, our new favorite."}
{"text":"Just don't do delivery. That's how I'll start it. I live two miles from the Bainbridge location and it took two hours for delivery. We hadn't tried Cleveland Pizza before as we're new to the area. The staff member on the phone was very pleasant but a good test for local places is to try delivery when you live close. It shows attention to detail, eagerness to please their local customer base among others. The delivery man was in his 50s (bless his sweet heart and this isn't about him but about the role the company gave him - knowing his age and the fact that it's January and has been 1 degree out, you {as a company} really couldn't find something for him to do in house? when the man on the phone was clearly younger, you didn't find it more suitable for him to be out making deliveries? My food was cold by the time it got to me two hours later. That being said, the pizza was decent... had it been delivered warm and fresh I may have a much higher opinion. I will give this place a second chance but please get it together the next time around."}
{"text":"A nice little place with average pizza.  The pizza has many different sauces which is about the only decent thing about it. The pizza just has a weird taste which isn't appetizing."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Toppings were big and chunky and great tasting. Got a couple large pizzas and a salad and everything was tasty and good portions. 

Went inside to pick food up and the employees were friendly and attentive. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"We just got a pizza, it was mediocre. In addition to that, the pizza driver decided to drive through our front yard instead of using the driveway. Sounds crazy right? When I called the manager to tell him about it, he had the attitude as if he could care less and did not even have 1% of empathy to the situation. This place has gone downhill dramatically in the past couple years. I will never order from them again and I would never recommend it to anybody."}
{"text":"Usually big fans of Cleveland Pizza but didn't have the best experience last night. Called in to order a pizza for delivery and referenced a special (medium 2 topping pizza for $9.99). Employee who answered the phone said he never looked at the website so didn't know the special, so he had to have the manager come help. Regardless, we stated multiple times that we wanted pepperoni and banana pepper. Never was asked how we wanted to pay, and when the pizza showed up, we only had banana peppers on it. Disappointing for sure."}
{"text":"Came to Cleveland Pizza for a sub sandwich.  I didn't want Subway or Jersey Mike's, so I figured I would try something new.   It was Great!!!"}
