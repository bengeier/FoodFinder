{"text":"Food was really tasty, was there for lunch started getting busy quickly. Customer service was good always smiling and servers had very good knowledge of the menu.  We tried a small warm LYCHEE SAKE!! DELICIOUS!!!!!!!! Would recommend and return any time. :)"}
{"text":"Omgsh I absolutely love this place. It's so fancy and the interior looks high class. I came here for my birthday and it was the best! The chef was so fun and the food was delicious. He even did tricks with the food. Like when I went he threw eggs in the air and I caught it XD. He even allowed me to cook but I said no because I was scared. I came here again on family day and the food was soo good!! The waiters were nice too. I really recommend this place if you want some fancy dinner. It would be a good place for a date ?(^o^)?"}
{"text":"Love their Teppanyaki.  They let you try out crack the eggs for the fried rice. Staff very friendly"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this restaurant after a friend recommended it. Sat down and waited for 10 mins while starring at the menu. Not even a cup of tea was offered. I finally flagged down a guy who looks to be the manager. He said \"just a sec\" then he proceeded to take out different sushi orders and just left me. Waited another  5 mins and he never came back. First time in my life that I just got up and left. Don't know if the guy is just having a bad day but he just missed a $$$ sale as I was gonna order some expensive stuff. Went back to my favourite Vietnamese noodle place = Pho Mi99 in the same plaza. Night and day service! Thanks Yang's for saving me some money tonight!"}
{"text":"way over priced   I wouldn't go for Teppanyaki again. The price for what you get is not worth it. $25 for what is ultimately grilled chicken breast with rice and veggies.   sushi was very fresh but you can get cheaper sushi option in the Vaughan area (see: Kyoto, Szechuan Szechuan) then this place.   Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The place seems nice, but the overall experience wasn't that great for us. The food was ridiculously expensive. The quality of sushi and sashimi was average. The shrimp tempura was $12 bucks for 3 pieces. We bought the assorted sashimi but there was barely anything in it, so we had to buy more rolls from the specialty rolls. When we got in, it was very rushed. They didn't even get us plates :/ menu was not descriptive explaining what's included in the assorted sushi and sashimi. Even the drinks were not even refillable. For group of 5, it was over $300.   Overall we weren't very satisfied and was still hungry in the end. You want good sushi, I'd go to Aoyama"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, the restaurant looks modern and inviting . Prices are higher at dinner than lunch. I have been about dozen times and will be back again."}
{"text":"Food is good hut if you go during regular days not weekend the quality goes down. The service is ok but make sure don't go after 9 pm on weekdays as they try to rush you out. Food and service gets compromised."}
{"text":"We went there for Sunday lunch (late lunch) not so crowded which is good. It was our first time to have the foods we ordered to be cooked before our eyes. Quite good experience. The foods are excellent a bit pricey though. The staffs and chefs are also nice. We might try another teppanyaki restaurat that is closer to where we live. We don't mind coming back here again if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Teppanyaki is ok at Yang's as my husband and I have been to similar restaurant. Customer service is terrible. We feel rip off from what we have order. They charged on green tea for which 99% of the Japanese restaurants will not do. Also, the waitress added additional salmon sashimi with extra charge (which we never ordered). We don't bother to go back to Yang's as I am sure we can find another teppanyaki place in Toronto with better customer service."}
{"text":"Had a fun time here. The chefs were friendly and made the cooking exciting. He even tried to throw food into our mouths to catch and eat. The kids loved this! The food was flavorful.  We tried the chicken, beef, sole. The salmon fried rice was delicious. My favorite was the fish! Very nice atmosphere and decor. Nice family restaurant"}
{"text":"Had a tappanyaki dinner in this place with family. It was an amazing and fun experience for entire family :) Food was great quality and very tasty! Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent bento boxes for lunch! Cool decor and good service. Pricey, but very nice once in a while."}
{"text":"In all these years i have never been to a teppanyaki where one chef is cooking most of my meals on another table.  Isnt the whole point of teppanyaki is to watch the chef cook all the food in front of you????   Its like going to the movies and just watching half the movies.  People pay good money for subpar food and entertainment."}
{"text":"Went for the Teppanyaki on Mother's day because it was the only restaurant near by that was not fully booked - now I know why. Very over-priced, food was below average, and boring showmanship from the cook. Service and decor was good but fell short to make up for the rest. Our fried rice and veggies were prepared in front of us; however the meat was done on the other side by another cook where it was not viewable. They asked us how we would liked our beef cooked and regardless of rare and medium rare requests, everything was served medium. There are a lot of better places to visit for a fraction of the cost. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The worst experience in my life ever. Don't ever come here if you don't want to be treated unfairly. The manager is the worst person in hospitality business ever. He is the reason why I am writing this review. Me, my husband and my 3 years old son went for teppanyaki there yesterday. The restaurant was quite empty when we walked in.  There is just couple of guest in the main dining area. And there is only one family in the teppanyaki room. The waitress gave us a seat right in front of the tables where the chef will cook. There were 2 seat prior to us that is empty . but these seats are located on a different side.  After we ordered our food suddenly this manager came to us and asked us to move to the other 2 seat just because there is another party coming in. I told him that we are 3 people here. He insisted that we moved. He even dare to use his rude rone to me and told me to move as if he is a dictator. I was so upset and i told him no. I have the right to stay here since we are here first. And also we have a little kid here who has to sit together with his parents.  After that he just left and then he gave us attitude. And then the party that supposed to come in decided to eat in the dining room anyway. So all this stupid madness that this stupid rude manager trying to create it's for nothing.  The thing is if that stupid manager used a nicer tone when he talk and treated you more like a person, i might have moved to those 2 sits.. But since he gave me attitude... Hell no... U shouldn't mess with people men!  I want to give negative 100 stars rating  if possible. But since the minimum is 1 star then  one star it is"}
{"text":"Today I called for take-out during lunchtime.  I was told when I went to pick up my order that it would be $23 rather then the $18 on the website (Maki Set B). The manager (?) would not honour the price advertized on the website and chose to send me away for a cost of $5 to the restaurant.   Even after I showed him the online price on my blackberry!!  You won't catch me in there ever again!!!"}
{"text":"The owner here is cheap and I'm telling you guys as a EX employee from this restaurant. I was first bussing tables & then serving. None of the workers get the tips because the owner keeps all the tips to himself. If you confront them about it, they lie about how they \"share\" the tips with everyone. Even if you have any problems, you'll never actually get to speak to the owner because he's a coward & hides in the back and makes the workers pretend they're managers or whatever to talk to you. We are all working our asses off to get paid like shit. I was getting paid 10.25 and then the highest I got was $11 after working there for awhile. With the tips I brought in myself, I definitely did not deserve to get paid shitty. There's a girl who works in the bar too which is the owners sister in law, she's really fake and will be friendly to customers (no shit she's trying to kiss your asses) but she will complain about a server if you don't reach their expected \"13% tip\" So next time you decide to \"tip\" just know that 100% of it goes straight to the owner and his family and that the reason why some servers may seem careless about their job is because they don't get paid well enough."}
{"text":"I am a very big fan of this place. I only went for Teppanyki once, years ago. But I go quite often for the sushi. A friend and I like to go here - for a year solid we would go at LEAST once a week. We often joke that they must put something addictive in their rolls.  We even know the order off by heart:  Maki set B Spicey salmon pizza yellow tail roll (which is nice and light as a contrast to everything else)  their prices always seem to go up regularly. while I sympathize with their need to turn a profit, I tend to sympathize with my wallet a tad more. Not that I particularly mind paying for what I enjoy so greatly, but it becomes a harder sell. Hence 4 stars instead of 5.  I have never had bad service here. Seating is comfortable. Nice ambience. If \i want to treat myself to a nicer lunch, this place immediately springs to mind (treat yoself!)  Far better to travel to vaughan for this delicious sushi, than to trek through that god awful mall, is all I'm saying!  Update: I've bumped this up to a 5 star rating. In the past 6 years that I've been here, I've not once had a bad meal or service. And some of the food has even been improved upon."}
{"text":"And then I tried the Teppanyaki!    Incredibly entertaining.  There was lots of customer participation and food was being thrown every which way.  Lots of laughing and learning and, of course, eating.  Great service yet again.  I highly recommend the Teppanyaki dinner here for a group gathering (ideally 8 people)."}
{"text":"Seeing Teppanyaki style restaurants in movies and television had piqued my interest for quite some time but aside from traveling into Toronto, I struggled to find a spot that offered this north of the 401. That was until I was at a Vaughan Shisha bar next door several weeks earlier that I realized a great spot was right on the door steps of Vaughan Mills Mall.  Once this place was on my radar I was determined to visit the first chance I got. That opportunity came about for my fathers birthday. We decided that this would be a great spot for our family of 5 to go for some quality dinner and a little bit of a show.  We made reservations but they weren't necessary on the Tuesday night as it wasn't busy at all. We were brought into one of the private table service rooms (normally would have been for at least 2 parties but with it being an off night we had the entire room to ourselves).  Our chef came in shortly after we were seated and began setting up his station, we ordered our dishes and the meats were brought out by the chef shortly after. - My siblings each ordered the beef ribs dinner - My parents each ordered the beef and shrimp - I ordered the Filet Mignon and Shrimp  Each meal comes with: Miso soup, salad, mix-vegetables, assorted mushroom,  and salmon fried rice (and dessert to finish).  Our chef was amazing - consistently engaging us, asking us questions, singing happy birthday (in the best poor English ever). He set things on fire and did amazing tricks with the mushrooms, eggs and onions (see my pictures) - he always made sure to give us warning when a 'cool trick' was coming so we could snap a photo. The funniest times were when he manged to get each of us up to do a trick ourselves one at a time - how wonderfully embarrassing and fun that was!!  Once the food started rolling out we are all very impressed. - Miso soup was hot and full of flavour - Salad was typical of most AYCE sushi spots but was nicely dressed - Mixed veggies and assorted mushrooms... AMAZING (especially when he would shoot a piece expertly into one of our mouths - Salmon fried rice wasn't my fav to be honest BUT it was pretty tasty.  By the time the meat came around we were already feeling a little full but there were seasoned and cooked perfectly we all found space for it somewhere - much to our chagrin later as we walked back to the car bellys stuffed.   Not one bad thing to say about the experience or the food - great place to visit for a special occasion or special date. However, diner beware - Teppanyaki ain't cheap. For the 5 of us to eat and have a round or of drinks our bill came to over $300.   Will be back again (hopfeully just not when I am paying ha ha)"}
{"text":"It was another rainy Sunday yesterday (why do we always get nice weather mid-week???) and my in-laws agreed to stay with kids, so my hubby and I went shopping at Vaughan Mills. The shopping was good but when we went to Yang's for sushi we were very disappointed. The fish tasted like it was there from yesterday, rice was too sticky, the service was terrible. I realize that it was our mistake - you shouldn't go on Sun to a sushi place next to a big shopping mall, but still we expected better based on our previous visit a few weeks ago. I noticed many 5 stars reviews here, which is quite surprising... for the price they charge there are much better sushi and teppanyaki places around... well, may be they have better sushi chefs on other days of the week."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great. Sushi was excellent. Had one of the sushi combos. Nice variety of fish and very fresh. My friend had a bento box of various meats and he liked it. Service was great but we were there during off hours. Restaurant was very modern and clean. I will be back soon. A little more expensive but worth every penny. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Teppanyaki is the best here! Esp the beef rib and black cod and Lobster tail  Amazing experience - great service. Worth every penny"}
{"text":"The Teppanyaki was good and had a lot of interaction with our group. There is a large variety for the teppanyaki and sushi. The cost was higher and expected a higher level of service from the waitress and the cooks. Overall it was a good experience with decent fresh food."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. They rush you to order drinks, order food. Have two chefs to cook each order and rush you to eat everything quickly. I know this is not traditional teppanyaki but at least let your customer enjoy the cooking style of teppanyaki.  After you eat, server rush to collect empty plates and rush you to order dessert. Finally rush you to pay with the machine in hand standing next to you."}
{"text":"I've been to Yang's twice in the last two weeks and had a really good experience both times. We ordered off of the Teppanyaki menu and the food was really good!  I asked if they could make my meal both gluten and lactose free and they happily accommodated me. They grilled my food on the other burner so they could avoid cross contamination. The teppanaki style dinners come with soup, salad, salmon fried rice, vegetables, and ice cream. Unfortunately, I couldn't eat the soup or ice cream but I gave them to other people in the groups.  During my first visit, I ordered the shrimp, chicken and scallops for dinner. The shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly. They were extremely tender and melted in my mouth. The chicken was also really good. On my second visit I ordered the Fillet Mignon thinking I could share my steak with other family members and be able to try their meats. I didn't realize the chef had added soya sauce to their food so I wasn't able to try their meats. ***If you have a food allergy or sensitivity, make sure you choose a dinner combo that has a different cuts of protein so you can try more***.   Allover, Everyone had a really good experience on both occasions. Everyone loved their meals and the food was prepared really well. The teppanyaki show is a little less grand than at some other restaurants (this is where they lost a star) but the food and ability to accommodate my diet made up for it.  We also celebrated my nieces and my birthday and they brought us two candles on a birthday crepe. I wasn't able to eat this but it was fun to make a wish.   Would I return? Yes!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for teppanyaki .  Took 40 mins after we were seated to take our order for drinks and food.  Cook did not start cooking until 1 hour later from seating .  Not acceptable.  They did not hire enough to cooks for the weekend.  The restaurant was not at full capacity so definitely under staff .  Price of food is not reasonable considering the service.  Will not have teppanyaki here again ."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst customer services and is misleading with their information. Highly not recommended to anyone looking for a better services. My sister and I called in and both received different information, very tricky owner!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was somewhat empty, there were only two tables occupied. But even then the washrooms were extremely dirty. The food was meh, the veggie tempura was undercooked, the oysters weren't fresh, the edamame was crunchy and not well seasoned. And most importantly it's very EXPENSIVE."}
{"text":"hands down the best teppanyaki you can have in toronto! A-MAZINGGGG. I've been here a bunch of times and every single time it is just superior.  Their salad dressing is the best japanese salad dressing i have ever had in my life.  I have considered asking them if I can buy it because I know they make it in house.   The veggies that come with the teppanyaki is not standard at all.  You get a variety of green and red peppers, zucchini, onions, button and another type of mushroom.   My fav things to get here -Their beef ribs are actually to die for.  The sauce it's marinated in is spectacular! The black cod OMFG grilled to absolute perfection and melts in your mouth with buttery goodness.  I always want more.  Finally the filet mignon is SO good.  Tender, always cooked just right and legit also melts in your mouth. You will NOT find a better teppanyaki place than this in the city, guaranteed."}
{"text":"The food we had was ok but they changed the portion sizes but not the price and when I asked to speak to a manager he just hid in the back and would not come over such a coward. oh well there loss i used to go often but now i need a new place in the area!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had any of their sushi here before, but I've had some of their lunch specials before.  The black cod is really good.  Also, really like the decor here.  It's a good place to come after or before going to Wonderland or Vaughan Mills (sorry for all you Vaughan people, but I don't know what else there is to do in your lovely city)."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around since Vaughan Mills opened.  It's the best north of Toronto Teppanyaki to be found.  The larger he group the more fun it is.  The rest of the menu is very well prepared as well.  Items like fatty tuna and miso cod are some off my favourites."}
{"text":"I went to Yang's out of curiosity really. I was craving terriyaki and there isn't much to choose rom in vaughan without worrying about msg. I walked in with my husband and the hostess was super kind and friendly she pulled out a menu and started explaining all that yang's has to offer. she explained how things were made, what the pricing was like, where to sit etc. and it was all we needed to be convinced that we wanted to try this place out!! So we chose the teppanyaki...located at the south-end of the restaurant they are seats located around a cooking station. They have about 5-6 cooking stations and basically it's dinner and a show.  The prices are a bit steep but you get what you pay for! The chicken teppanyaki starts at about $18 and the prices can go upto almost $40/ person but it all depends on what you want. We had the sirloin steak teppanyaki and it was amazing. The prices for tepanyaki include the plate of choice,miso soup (cream of tofu...and I dont like tofu but I could not taste it in the soup). salad, mixed grilled veggies and salmon fried rice. This was one of the best meals I've had at any japanese restaurant and it was so entertaining. You sit and a chef comes to your circle sets up at the cooking station and prepares your meal before your eyes...except with a bit of flare. He makes an onion volcanoe, he throws veggies at your to catch in your mouth, he spins eggs and cracks them in the air...and best of all everything cooked is placed on a serving plate in front of you so you can take your time and eat and the food won't be crowded on your plate. I recommend this place hands down!!"}
{"text":"Great place for Tepan. Food is fresh and the chef are entertaining. Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Come in with the mindset that it is a Japanese RESTAURANT!  It is not an AYCE Japanese Restrauant.  It is not a Japanese Ramen Restaurant.  It is not a Japanese Izakaya Restaurant.  They offer Teppanyaki, Sushi, Sashimi, and Set Meals.  Expect to pay the price for the meal which I believe to be somewhat pricey but the service and the detail to attention does warrant such cost.  I had a couple Lunch experiences here as if I BOOKED the whole restaurant for my friend and I.  The decor is EXCELLENT however when the place is so empty it feels as if all the eyes of the staff are solely on your table.    I mean I see the 2 Sushi Chefs at the Sushi Counter but what can they really be BUSY doing if we didn't even order much raw fish items?  This place is definitely NOT the same as their original AYCE location in Markham.  I give the food a GOOD rating which are nicely presented but for lunch all I can really afford is their CHEAPEST Bento set.  Yang's immediate neighbours are mostly inexpensive restaurants except for maybe Peak Top Restaurant."}
{"text":"The sushi is great here especially Maki Set B.  The Kani salad is delicious as well but pricey at $6 for a tiny bit.  It is unfortunate that the service is not as good as the food.  The waitress came to take our order and had no clue what we were ordering and half way through asked us to show her the items on the menu because she was new.  They did not come by to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything else even though we were the only table in the dinner area."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great price. Wonderful service.  Had dinner at a cooking station and then were able to move our group to a table for conversation."}
{"text":"I went there for a birthday once and it was a very interesting experience. First of all, if you can get a table where they cook food right in front of you - make sure you're there! It is sort of like a show with flames and food games! Staff is super-friendly!!! They couldn't find my receipt at the end and there was a little bit of confusion on whether i paid or not. They did find a proof of payment and as an apology they brought me a cocktail! That was sweet of them!  Food was delish - i jsut wish the portions were a bit bigger!"}
{"text":"This place is not bad.  The food portions and quality is ok.   Some of the chefs are fun and interactive and some are as fun as scrambled porn.  On my last visit I was in shock when there were two tables basically cooking at the same time.  For some reason our entire meal minus the rice was cooked at the other table and all the action was there?  Are you serious?  What is the point of teppanyaki cooking table when I don't even get to see the actual food being cooked.   The place is not clean also.  If you look at the corners of your table and inside the little cracks you will see basically Aids of old food and bits and will lose your appetite.  My recommendation is the shrimp and steak combo.  Great giant shrimps.  The chicken is very bland and has an Aidsy taste to it."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to write a review on this place. I've been coming here for about 2 years...And I need to say, that they never disappoint me! The only thing I need to say is: they great food and nothing else matters. And yes, they put up a great show chopping up food in front of you)  Service: 5 star Food: 5 star  Atmosphere: 4 star Prices: moderate"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Very clean, modern, well designed atmosphere, perfect for all sorts of occasions   Food:  1. Chicken & Salmon Teppanyaki Combo : Salad was delicious, Miso broth was fresh and yummy, this was my first time trying teppanyaki, and the experience was cool and wasnt too pricy from the regular bento boxes. He only performed one trick, with a tower of onions. Salmon was fresh and seasoned with freshly squeeze lemon and salt and pepper, the chicken was stir fried with teriyaki sauce, and there were also a side of stir fried veggies. Chicken i found was a bit tough, and dry. Wouldnt do chicken again.   2. Short Ribs Combo: Ribs were awesomely marinated, delicious in all aspects. there was a decent portion size of it too.   Overall: will definitely come back if im in the area. its definteily a cool experience."}
{"text":"First time here it was unexpectedly good, especially the spicy salmon rolls and the shrimp tempura!   Quality restaurant with good ambiance, don't hesitate to dine here."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, extremely flavourful food. Highly highly recommended. Tepanyaki is delicious but found the cooks paid attention more to one side than the other. I would recommend going in and sitting and ordering a meal as its the best Asian food I've ever had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Loved it. We celebrated hubby's bday here. This place is amazing, food is delicious, staff are super friendly & fun. U must at least try teppanyaki once if not more. its great with a group of friends or just the two. They accommodate to all. Definitely will come bck. It was truly a wonderful & delicious experience"}
{"text":"Sushi is yummy, and the teppanyaki is fresh and fun to watch. the decor is also really cool and chic! A great place to go with friends."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times, and I have had a good experience every time.  Their teppanyaki experience is fun, and the meat used is high quality.  The chef knows how to put on a show to entertain and make us laugh.  I actually don't find the teppanyaki that expensive, because the combined value of the food plus entertainment is so high.  The sushi and sashimi here is fresh.  The sashimi is sliced thick; they don't treat you cheaply here.  I like the maki more than the nigiri.  This is because the maki is so well made - the seaweed tastes lightly toasted, the rice is so thin, and the maki is securely rolled.  The portion is big, too.  The nigiri is good here as well.  I wonder why the chef doesn't put a bit of wasabi inside, only because this is the way I prefer it.  The service is polite, prompt and friendly.  The interior decor is westernized and contemporary.  One can easily mistaken the restaurant as a dessert lounge.  I seldom give expensive restaurants 5 stars, and it is expensive here.  I do so for Yang's because it reliably offers good food, good services and good experience every time I have visited.  It is good for both group entertainment (teppanyaki) and intimate celebration (dining room).  I feel comfortable taking visiting friends and family, or having birthday celebration here.  I know people will have a good time."}
{"text":"We were a part of 9 (6 adults and 3 kids under 5 years) and we all enjoyed our dinner .. Really good sushi and tepeniaki .. The show was nice the chefs were fun.. Would defiantly go again  .."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here and my LAST time. Found hair on the plate while my mom was eating her fish. The chef did basically 'Nothing' to entertain. Just did volcano and fire thing. That's it! Very rushed service. Busy place but not enough chef??  Quickly cooked the dinner and disappeared.  We went there for fun and good food. But we got neither..ask for another hot Miso soup and got charged $3 for it. And of course we paid Full price for the black cod dish after we found the long long hair on the plate. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I've been here maybe 3 or 4 times. Services isn't the best. It's run by young Chinese people who treat you as thought you're eating at a Hong Kong cafe. I don't think they've ever really said thank you, can't suggest anything on the menu and are not very people friendly.   So with that aside, the food is not too bad.  Some of their rolls are medeocre and their hot foods are too. Oysters are good, but how can you get that wrong? They serve the cheapest icecream possible.  For the cost of the menu items you'd figure they'd serve at least Mario's Gelato or something.   Definitely have had better.  I'm pretty picky with sushi so I guess with the ambiance you'd expect a lot more!!"}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews for Yang's on Yelp I decided to have lunch with a friend at this restaurant today. It's conveniently located right across from Vaughan Mills so you can drop by after your shopping adventures.  We opted for teppanyaki after I had a disappointing first experience at Tako Sushi. I was really hoping that the chef would do tricks and he sure did! The teppanyaki order comes with miso soup, salad, mixed vegetables, and rice. We both ordered the chicken fillet order while I added the jumbo shrimps (seafood lover!). We also ordered the dynamite and spider rolls to share.  The chef was very friendly and told us ahead of time when he was about to do a trick so we could take pictures. He even encouraged us to go behind the grill and try some of the tricks. My friend and I didn't want to do it because we knew that we would embarrass ourselves haha. The chef even tossed vegetables into people's mouths which was VERY entertaining.  The salad dressing was pretty good but the lettuce didn't seem fresh. The chicken and shrimps were juicy, delicious and not even slightly dry! The sushi rolls were a bit on the big size so I wouldn't suggest trying to stuff an entire one in your mouth during a date.  The only \"negative\" thing is that it was a bit cramped in the teppanyaki room.   Overall, this place is great and since the chef did tricks and was fun, I give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here with two of my friends after a long day at wonderland. We were hungry so we opted for something close and noticed Yang's when we pulled into the plaza. To explain to everyone our dining experience here; just picture the Behemoth ride. It started off really well. The first round of food was really good. Waiter was attentive, and great decor. Then as fast as it was good, it went down southhhhhh. As steep as the behemoth drop. They kept bringing us the wrong orders, and then forgetting to bring some up. First time it happened we just ignored it and ate what came, but it kept freaking happening!!!!!!! How do you keep messing up orders when there's only about 3 tables to look after. By the end of the night it was just us repeatedly telling them the food they were bringing over wasn't ours. The waiter also kept commenting that we ate a lot for 3 petite girls. He said it about 4 times and it was kind of weird..... honestly such an odd dining experience. Also we asked for the creme brûlée for dessert and the waiter told us that the \"rebellions in the back refuse to make it but the owner will\"... WHY THE HECK would you tell your guests about the drama in the back. Weird. Don't come here."}
{"text":"I went here twice and both times had just the sushi (not the teppanaki so I can't comment on it) However, the sushi was high quality and the taste was wonderful  We started with the Kani salad, which was def the best Kani salad I have ever had but the portion was quite small We had sashimi which was fresh and very tender (we were impressed) In terms of sushi, everything was good (we usually get dynamite rolls, dragon rolls and 1 or 2 other \"specialty\" type rolls) Here, we had the \"volcano roll\", which is California rolls topped with a hot, spicy seafood medley Definitely the best sushi here  It is pricey but is quite comparable to other higher-end restaurants such as Ginza"}
{"text":"To start this review, if I could I would give this restaurant negative stars. This is probably the worst restaurant I've ever been too. When it comes to service and food, the quality is absolutely garbage. The waiter rather woke up on the wrong side of the bed or did not enjoy working there because his attitude was absolutely atrocious. It took 15 minutes to get a glass of water. 45 mins to get 2 glasses of ginger ale. And in the end we never received our all you can eat sushi. After waiting a total of 75 mins. They ended up losing our order and just said for us to order again like nothing happened. Once the manager came, he totally ignored what we were saying and kept pushing us to order, order , order. Rather he didn't understand or he chose to ignore us but either way, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anybody. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Hidden among the many small strip malls that circle Vaughan Mills mall lies Yang's, a sushi/teppanyaki restaurant.  Although I wouldn't call it upscale, it has a nice decor despite my manager commenting on the outdated white leather looking seats.  I'm usually oblivious to these sorts things but I did not they'd played music that would come off my 15 year old daughter's playlist (including a few old school rap classics).  I was there for lunch and started with the Kani salad ($6) which was quite reminiscent of the surimi salad at the Mandarin.  In other words, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  I ordered my typical spicy tuna rolls ($8) which I usually use as benchmark to compare sushi establishments.  They had a good portion of decently (but not amazingly) seasoned tuna.  I also ordered what I thought were Yang's maki roll (shrimp tempura, bbq eel and tobiko).  Instead, I got Yam rolls ($7) which were....well....yams...and expensive ones at that. Once again, they had ample filling but were just yams and rice.  The presentation was a little anemic...in fact the plate looked a white as the outdated seats.  It was decent and better than eating in the food court but far from the best sushi I've had.    Maybe the kobe beef dinner is better...."}
{"text":"not bad for a date or somthing, cuz the chefs do tricks at the teppanyaki table unlike some other teppanyaki restaurants. They even ask you to join in and try tricks.  Points lost cuz its over priced."}
{"text":"You truly get what you pay for here, a meal with large portions, and entertainment while your food is prepared. The chef working the grill the evening we came did quite a few tricks and was friendly. Be prepared to catch a piece of fried egg in your mouth when the chef tosses it your way.   The portions were large enough that I was able to order a meal with an extra side and share it with my daughter and still feel stuffed at the end of the meal.   I had the scallops and shrimp, which also comes with options, I opted for the fried rice and vegetables. The scallops and shrimp were a fair size and tender, everything was well cooked and tasty.  The decor is very modern and stylish, I wish the stools by the grills had a higher back though.  If you haven't experienced teppanyaki yet I highly recommend trying Yang's, fun, filling and well worth the price."}
{"text":"I was a little reluctant to come here after my botched hibachi experience but it was for my work Christmas party, so I went. There were about 70-80 of us there and they dealt with the large group about as well as could be expected. A few things were forgotten (but always eventually done) but that's to be expected.  Our chef was hilarious and engaged our table well by having us come up and give the cooking a shot. He had a great sense of humour, which made the experience even better.  I was a bit nervous about the gluten free accommodation but went forth anyways. They said the miso soup was gfree but it had tofu and I was paranoid that the tofu had wheat flour so I didn't eat it. I can't comment on whether or not it was safe because I really don't know (and the waiter didn't seem 100% sure). My salad had no dressing, which was sad. At least give me some oil and vinegar! So sad and dry, haha.  It gets better though. We had the option between sushi and spring rolls, so I was able to get sushi. They gave 3 cucumber and 3 avocado rolls. It wasn't the most amazing sushi I've ever had but it was good!  The chef was great at keeping my foods safe throughout the preparation. He always served my food before adding soy sauce (still tasted amazing!), and didn't allow himself to get caught up in cooking and forget (although he did advise me to yell at him if I saw him going for the soy sauce before I had my food). I had the steak which was great. Very fresh, nice cuts of meat. I also had the scallops. They were also very fresh and tasty. One of my co-workers is allergic to shellfish, so the two chefs in our little area (also two grills) split the meat cooking. My chef didn't do the scallops. The other chef added soy sauce and then when he was handing out the scallops my chef told him I couldn't eat that (!). So he not only throughly cleaned his utensils and the area, but he then lit the grill top on fire to sterilize it. I was so pleased with that ... I couldn't believe it!  Overall I had a great experience! The guys at this place really understand gluten free and how to do it right! They just need some confirmation on the soup and to find a gfree salad dressing."}
{"text":"Sexy sushi and fire! Going to the suburbs pays off!   Across from Vaughn Mills mall, Yang's is a teppanyaki and sushi restaurant that exceeded my expectations. Upscale service and atmosphere are a welcome change to the regular old sushi joints. The prices are a bit steep, but the sushi is excellent and the selectionis  fantastic. Families and large parties seated around the teppanyaki grills were laughing and chatting, the fun atmosphere and sleek design will have me coming back when I need my outlet mall fix."}
{"text":"WARNING - STAY AWAY - RUDE WAITRESS!  We came with a group of 10 for a Teppanyaki dinner. We made reservations but still had to wait 45 minutes to get seated.  Why make reservations?   Once seated, the service was poor.  It took forever to get any drinks from a crusty waitress and guess, what they got our drinks wrong.   Our dinner took another hour before the chef came out to cook our food.   The chef tried to engage us and make us laugh but he was not very funny.  The chef allowed people from the opposite table help cook our food (I guess he wanted customer participation) but that was disgusting. Someone from another table touching our food...Eww.  I was with a group of friends that enjoyed their alcohol so we were a group that spent a lot of money.    At the end, the waitress got upset  and disgusted with us for taking too long to gather our money to pay the bill.  They were trying to rush us out and brought us the bill before our deserts came out.  She started to rush us to pay but my friend was still finshing her glass of wine. Her poor body language and disgusted look really bothered our group.  She actually had the audascity to make a rude comment about us to the other waitresses about my friends taking there time to collect for the bill.  Normally this group of friends is quite generous with tips but after her unacceptable behaviour, I told my friends to not leave her an extra cent.  Stay away from this place. The staff are rude and unattentive.  The decor in the restaurant is run down and needs an update.   Spend your money elsewhere.  We will never be back."}
{"text":"food was great but you have to wait for so so so looooooong.........lunch bento box would be a Good choice"}
{"text":"Was going to go for pho and ended up here which is a nice change. Nice high ceiling decor. The teppanyaki area is enclosed from all the booth seating which is nice.   Happy:  They had a wide variety of lunch specials which was nice. I got lunch combo c which included Yang's curry chicken, a chunky spring roll with taro inside (not a big fan of it, but it was hot) and asparagus rolled beef which was a nice touch to the bento box. The veggie portion was nice since I like my veggies at every meal. At the beginning, we got the usual salad and miso soup which was not salty. I devoured everything ....   Not happy: ... Except the chicken which I didn't know it was deep fried. The creamy curry sauce made it less oily.   The service was good. They didn't charge us for hot tea and the washroom was big and clean.   Verdict:  after shopping at Vaughn mills, it's worth going to this place to fill up and regain your energy."}
{"text":"We've been here for teppanyaki a number of times in the past, mainly in groups of 4 or more. This past evening we were celebrating an occasion, so we ordered a couple of additional dishes that we don't normally order.  For starters, we had a salad and miso soup (comes with teppanyaki), sashimi, sushi, hamachi, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and edamame. The sashimi was very good and fresh. It includes red tuna, salmon, white tuna, octopus, and some other fish I can't remember. The sushi consisted of an unagi roll, a spicy salmon roll, and a green dragon roll. They were all delicious. The hamachi was very juicy on the inside, but slightly dry on the outside. The tempura was very good as well, battered just the right amount and fried in clean oil.  For dinner, we had dinner W, which is black cod, shrimp, scallops, and steak. The dinner usually starts with the chef cooking the vegetables, which include red bell pepper, mushrooms, and zucchini. At the same time, they build a volcano from onions, which they light with fire and cooking oil. The main course was delicious. The shrimps were huge. The scallops were perfectly cooked. I watched the entire time they were cooking and thought that the scallops would overcook, but that wasn't the case.  At this point, the chef usually starts making the rice. I suggest going with the salmon fried rice. They usually perform an egg slicing trick and requests audience participation. The chef spins the egg and asks you to pick it up, flip it, and slice it. Tip: it's tempting to slice the egg upwards while it's in the air. Instead, let the egg fall onto the edge of your cooking utensil. The next thing the chef will do is ask someone to catch a piece of the cooked egg in their mouth. No tips here... most people catch it with their nose. The fried rice was very good.  Finally, we had the steak, which was also good, but I was stuffed at that point so I took most of the rice and steak home. But there's always room for dessert. We shared a bowl of red bean ice cream. It was very tasty.  All in all, a good meal that's both delicious and entertaining."}
{"text":"It's ok not that great. We were here last week with family. Overall experience including cleanliness. I would recommend OK. Service charge 15% is included in the bill. Which will not be told & the payment machine will again give you options of service charge %. So please read the bill carefully."}
{"text":"I have been in this restaurant a few times and today's lunch deserves 5 stars. The sushi and sashimi set is just delightful. I like the hammered cast iron tea pot. Can't have lunch without a good pot of tea!  Big crowd for Friday lunch. Only complaint I have is staring at a glass vase with one single no leaf bamboo on my table. I suggest putting a more cheerful floral arrangement or a more healthier bamboo plant. That's all!"}
{"text":"The best place for tempinyaki. I had the best time there with my friends. The service is excellent and very friendly. The food is very fresh and a little over priced but it is by far worth it. My friends and i go there when ever we are in the mood for sushi or want to dine in at there tempinyaki dining room."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service started good... Until after we paid the bill and I asked the waiter if I could show my son the room where they were serving teppanyaki. My son is 4 and I out he would like to try it next time. The waiter said no, it would not be possible. I will not be returning here over something that could have totally been avoided.   I give it 2 stars because the food was good but service was not consistent. Some waiters are rude."}
