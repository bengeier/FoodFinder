{"text":"Great sushi bar. We picked up some freshly made sushi, and they were delicious! I would highly recommend this place, the gentlemen serving us was very nice."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. They have lunch special which is a good thing. I took the chicken katsu but I should have taken sushi. The chicken was ok. It tasted like kitchen. The rolls that come with it were not that great. I was with someone who took the sushi. 

I will be honest and I regret not taking those. They looked fresh with the right amount of rice. I'll try those next time and update my review accordingly"}
{"text":"Great little family run sushi place in central Montreal. Guys who work there are really nice. Fluent in both English and French. Prices seemed pretty cheap and food was very fresh. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"My family got a huge plate to share and it wasn't too bad! It's new I think so we didn't really know what we were going to get.

I thought the rolls were fresh and the plater was beautiful. The menu is big and they have a nice lunch menu. With specials and combos. 

We placed an order to be delivered at 7pm and they were there on time. You pay in advance.

I would order again."}
{"text":"Their poke bowl is fantastic! I get the deluxe that has salmon and fried shrimp. Its crunchy sweet sour savoury, has rice and salad in it. Its a perfect balance. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Always love my choices here. The young proprietor runs an excellent biz.  The good variety of ingredients are really fresh, portions are very good and the rolls are tasty and creative."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Montreal so far! Me and the hubby found this place by chance. We had come to Mile End for a food event that happened to have long lines and was too crowded. Great surprise! This tiny place holds great, fresh food at an affordable price (we had a huge amount of sushi and a Miso soup). The special attention to our satisfaction was noticed since minute 1 and ended with an offer of spring rolls on the house. That's the old (and effective) way to gain customers! Will come back any time!"}
{"text":"Amazing quality sushi, cozy place and super friendly and attentive staff!!! Will definitely come back!!"}
