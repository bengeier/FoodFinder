{"text":"Really good food. Owner is very passionate about his menu. He's usually at the front cash, talk to him and you will understand."}
{"text":"Solid, fast Pad Thai. Never had anything else but the Pad Thai is a good meal. If you don't believe me, feel free to buy me one and see if I don't eat it. I dare you. Double dare."}

{"text":"Green Mango used to be located just south of Yonge and Bloor many many years ago. Back in those days, this place was truly one of my top picks for quick, inexpensive, and AMAZING food! When they closed, I cried inside. Funnily enough, their old location found itself referenced in two of my recent reviews of other places that are in the same area today. In both cases, I was criticizing those two other restaurants and lamenting that Green Mango wasn't around anymore.

Then I thought to myself; Is there any chance that Green Mango just moved somewhere out of my usual areas? A quick google search found that there were still a few different Restaurants owned by Green Mango and that their owner sticks to working in the Green Mango Express out west.

I was overjoyed and convinced my wife to make a pilgrimage after work to try this place out! I was pleased to find the owner working right up front and more than happy to reminisce about the old days.

I was a tad disappointed that I wasn't able to find my old favorite food choices as they have been updated since. That being said, the food is still really great, the servings are generous and the prices are right! Even though this place is about a 20 minute highway drive away from where we live, my wife still wants to come out again soon. :)

So you might ask why I'm giving this place 4 stars if the food isn't quite as good as it used to be. Well, that's because it would have gotten a 5 if it was! 4 is still bloody good and this place deserves it!"}
{"text":"One of the least enjoyable chicken pad Thais I've ever eaten about a third of..  (sorry, run on sentence).  Minimal chicken, poor cuts of chicken. Sauce was more like ketchup.  Friendly staff at least and clean interior."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service! Best food for a good price value! Our go to place for Asian food cravings!"}
{"text":"We were celebrating one of my colleague's birthdays so we decided, since we all love Green Mango Boys (at Cloverdale), we would try the newly opened Green Mango Express.

While I can't speak for everyone, two of us ordered Curry Pad Thai and we both found it to be very dry and the rice noodles were overcooked. It was unfortunate because Asian food is all about texture and this was borderline mushy. One colleague ordered the Lemongrass Chicken; she said it was good but kind of watery. The ones that had Mango Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Pho (with beef) and Banh Mi (with beef short rib) all loved their dishes. The Banh Mi was loaded with meat and looked really good; I'll definitely order that next time.

Service was super friendly and they even gave us two bags of shrimp chips on the house; however, I have to deduct a star for the overcooked Pad Thai. Also, you may want to note that, although they do deliver, it's only after 5:00 p.m.

I think 3.5 stars is fair rating for now."}
{"text":"Amazing pad thai. It's my new favourite spot. Food is quick and taste amazing. Never had to wait."}
