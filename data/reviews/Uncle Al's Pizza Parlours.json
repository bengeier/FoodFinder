{"text":"I ordered the lunch special for $5.. two large slices you select topping and a soda.. pizza was hot out of oven... Great tasting pizza..."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place, and them being right around the corner from our house definitely doesn't help! My favorite is by far the Taco Fold Over. The staff has always been so very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust pizza from Uncle Al\"s. The key is the sauce and the cheese. There was just the right amount of cheese, sauce and pepperoni. It was very tasty. I'll definitely be back since I live right up the street! Highly recommended."}
