{"text":"Went on recommendation from a trusted source. Thanks Carmalina and Roy @ Rebel Rouge.  Everything was well-made and fresh. Owner is very friendly and we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best restaurants around. George and His team have not compromised a single item on their menu; only the best, especially the high quality organic meat. I have eaten at many restaurants in the Aurora/ Newmarket area, and I highly recommend this spot for a meal, big or small. Appreciate the freshness!"}
{"text":"Great place! Bought lunch for the construction crew working on our house and they thoroughly enjoyed it. Portions are huge and fries are nice and thin. I ordered the pork and chicken gyros (pita wrap) with fries and a Greek salad and also the gyro poutine. The gyro meat is flavourful and some pieces are crispy while others are nice and tender. Order it Greek style and get fries in the wraps. The jalape√±o tzatziki is pretty awesome and did I mention the fries are thin cut and crispy? Salad was also a good portion, fresh and with lots of cheese, but could do with a bit more dressing. Poutine was ENORMOUS and came with gyro meat, tzatziki, and feta cheese - it was delicious but share with a friend I couldn't finish it. Prices are fair, $12 for a pita wrap combo."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great taste, clean establishment. Delicious taste. Lamb souvlaki, pork yeero on a pita bread. Yum!!  Will return again."}
{"text":"These guys are friendly as hell - souvs are cheap (6) place is clean and bright can't and for more."}
{"text":"First time but not our last!  This authentic Greek cuisine is made quick, yet is simply delicious. The pita is made daily on the premises.  Had the chicken souvlaki with rice, Greek salad and pita bread on the side. Reminiscent to some of the finer Greek restaurants on 'the Danforth' without the higher cost and paid parking.  Service is super friendly and yes - their proud Greek Canadians.  The only caveat is it's geared towards take-out (no delivery as of yet) therefore don't expect any real plates or fancy cutlery, although there are 10 tables for dining.  Never the less, definitely worth it, if your into fresh healthy food!"}
{"text":"Extremely open, clean and inviting space. Perfect service. Everyone is definately a pro and everything looks top notch. Very nicely branded shop all around.  We ordered two wraps (pork, lamb), and the chicken fingers for the kiddo. Taste A+++. The lamb was soft and pork perfectly spiced.  Will be back for sure! The fact that this place is in Aurora and we're stuck with the garbage that's in Toronto is unfair.  Small advice from one business owner to another; Open shop in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Yiiiiiiro is yreat! As traditional as it gets, the pork yiro was delicious and greek salad was tasty too! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A new greek place to grab a quick lunch. There is seating available and the restaurant is very clean and modern looking.   The staff are super friendly and happy. I ordered the chicken yeero pita with fries.   The pita was soft and fluffy, the toppings and tzatziki were good as well. The only thing that would have liked more is if I tasted the chicken more. I felt like the feta cheese and tzatziki sauce were too overpowering which made the chicken taste a little unflavourful.   The fries were fried perfectly crisp - and they give you a lot! I like how they fry it when you order it.   Overall I enjoyed my lunch here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The falafel is flavourful and everything is fresh. The Greek salad is delicious. Can't wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"These are my instructions:  Go get a pork gyro when they open with spicy tzatziki, feta, tomato and onion. Tell me that it's not the greatest gyro on the face of this earth. Wash it down with a fried calamari which is the most tender and delicious humanly possible."}
{"text":"I decided to try GRCo Grill for a change over my usual Greek food fare. I quite enjoyed it! Service was excellent, prices were reasonable and the chicken souvlaki dinner was quite good! The accompanying salad was fresher and more tasty than with  comparable dinners at competing restaurants. I also liked the flavour of the tzatziki which complemented my meal just perfectly. You know I had to try dessert! The baklava was decent too! I will most definitely return for dinner (might dine in this time; it's a casual, quick-stop kind of restaurant)."}
{"text":"Yum, fresh new spot with great food! Very friendly service, also very quick. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated, just visit and try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Great food, great guy runnin the joint! Chicken yeero tastes so good, makes u wanna slap yo mamma! I eat here at least twice a week. Fresh and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a great GREEK place! We tried it for the first time and were shocked and completely impressed.  The food was great. Friendly service and great atmosphere."}
