{"text":"Came  by waiting on a business near by to open.   Very surprise for breakfast. Great people working here. Very friendly Just on spot. Fresh fruit   Bacon just right. Mimosa  were just right  wish it was close to my house. 75 miles away"}
{"text":"A great daytime bar where people bring their dogs and have a drink on the patio on the weekends.  Good drink specials and reasonable food options. They recently fixed a staffing issue, which could explain older poor reviews."}
{"text":"Best bar food around. I like the recent upgrades to the beer menu and the Thursday trivia is a blast. They even do a family feud thing at the end which is hilarious. Good stuff for a small, non-corporate place."}
{"text":"A cool relaxed townie bar with a nice menu. Some awesome stuff:

-At least one good drink and food special daily. Tons of lunch specials for $5.49, with the menu having nice variety. Lots of traditional bar snacks, good wings, awesome nachos, and lots of healthy things too, like the house made hummus and veggie plate, caprese wrap, salads and fresh sandwiches and burgers.

-lots of games here, pool (upstairs) golden tee, cornhole (tournaments weekly) and a couple sweepstakes machines.

-excellent patio area, and dogs are welcome, so feel free to bring your pup out with you (they need to stay on their leash though). The patio fills up quick before cornhole tournaments so arrive early for a good spot!

I used to have some major beef with an awful witch bartender who used to work here. I talked to a regular about this a little while ago and found out she no longer works here. Five stars!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Best staff and great food. You might have a tomato or onion on your chicken sandwich, but no employee won't be willing to to fix that in minutes without just pulling it off. You would get a new bun and everything because the staff here cares about every single part of this business.

If you come in screaming at people like they aren't even human  - you should probably make your own sandwich and live with the choices you've made. In other words. This place is great. But if you are a terrible human being and a lunatic- stay away. The food is great, the service is great- the management is great and the company is great."}
{"text":"Came here for Father's Day. They had live music which was great. It took about 15 mins to get my drink from the bar. It was not crowded and shouldnt of taken that long. Then we waited about an hour for our food. We got wings, a burger, fries and a grilled chicken salad. When we finally got the food, the chicken was cold. Had to ask the server if it come hot or cold and she said hot. Mine was cold like straight out of the fridge. Also if you ask for fries, they bring out chips. Have to ask for the long fries. The entire meal was compt but still wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I went  in for lunch and had the chicken fingers and fries, it took 30 minutes. The bartender was mean and I thought I can go home for this treatment."}
{"text":"Great food. Great people. Everyone is friendly. Amazing wings and fries. Give it a try, hidden gem"}
{"text":"Servers are happy and friendly and provide great service. Patrons are fun and welcoming. Food is consistently really good. Great specials every day of the week and good music several nights a week. Nothing fancy, which is good - awesome place."}
{"text":"we ate here super bowl night and I got some of the best lemon pepper wings ever
but after tonight they are off the list for good.

I ordered lemon and pepper wings for pickup and got over cooked, burnt wings with
maybe 5% lemon. I am very disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Hands-down this is the best barfood anywhere around Lake Norman. They always serve dinner until 2 AM which is fantastic! They are dependable and you can always count on a great meal even late at night. The staff was fantastic and their weekly specials are incredible. The only downfall is their draft beer selection could use a major overhaul. Their prices are very reasonable when you get fantastic portions."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was fresh. Everything was made from scratch. Florentine Eggs Benedict was amazing."}
{"text":"Known for most of its existence as The Graduate-Lake Norman, Lake Town Tavern has taken the old, spacious building with high-ceilings and given it what it needed most...a good cleaning!

The result is a fresher interior, new menu and a small side patio for outdoor dining and lounging.

As the Graduate, and later as the short-lived Beer Goggles, the bar was largely a late-night hangout for bar hoppers making their rounds (pun intended).

The layout and the scene has remained largely the same, although the new owners are pushing the restaurant side as well.

Essentially one large room, the dining area and bar are virtually interchangeable. A small stage for live music sits at one end, next to a solitary dart board, with bathrooms around the corner.

A staircase doubles back on its way to a loft area that contains a few pool tables and foosball tables.

One benefit of the high-ceilings is that it helps to dissipate cigarette smoke somewhat.

Menu-wise, the wings, chips and pizza is pretty good. 

Overall, for those who frequented the old Graduate, this is a step up.
And although the food is pretty good, the late-night atmosphere remains the calling card.

One thing about the location...its kinda hard to find, as it sits back in the parking lot surrounded by a couple rows of small strip-businesses. There's no good landmark to guide you in, so be on the lookout. 
You'll likely have to pass it once and then turn around."}
{"text":"Great Casual Tavern.  Try the Fish and Chips

I enjoyed this place last time I was here and for some reason, it's been awhile since I've been back even though it's in my  neighborhood.  Wife is in Pittsburgh so I decided to try it again.

Same as last time.  Great Food and Service.  Last time I had Fish and Chips and they were great.  Decided to try them again although normally I would have been adventurous and tried something different. For a Tavern, they do have an extensive menu and while most of the favorites are there, there are some very creative offering as well.

One of them is what the call, Boat Bread.  On the surface, sounds a bit like a cross between bruchetta and caprese.  Difference is that it is not based on Mozzarella Cheese and it is served hot like an open face grilled cheese.  In any case, delicious

Service is great. Atmosphere is typical Tavern but not a Sports Bar.  No enough large screen TV's.  They do have an outside Corn Hole areas that apprently is very popular.

Good Food and Service speak for themselves.  Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"food, okay..service, less than..other patrons, rather sketchy..drinks were poured well for decent price..might go back when I'm packing.."}
{"text":"Best bloody mary. Great food and friendly service. Quesadilla is legit and so are the wings. Not a bad meal or experience yet. Be sure to ask for Rizzo on Monday's or Choosy during the week or weekends."}
{"text":"I love to come here for two reasons:
     1. Great breakfast
     2. I get to see sweet Tabitha Cornelius. 

Love you girl."}
{"text":"This is a great little place that mostly only locals hang out.   Seems like the same crowd every time I have been there.  The servers are on a first name basis.  They have great nightly beer specials and food specials.  

Keep in mind, this is a dive bar.  So food is prepared accordingly.  I have had decent wings and pizza.   The server actually cared what I thought, the cook came out to see how my meal was.   Last night I had the oyster po'boy and my wife had the shrimp wrap.   Both were flavorful and filling, topped off with the $2 beer special, it was a win win.

They have a lot going on, so check to see.  Last night was trivia night and it was packed.  Recently they started having a Sunday Bike Night with 50 cent wings, I need to check that out......."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I decided to try Lake Town Tavern for the first time.  We were VERY disappointed with every aspect of our visit for the following reasons:  1.  The music was entirely too loud.  2.  The service was spotty and was without a beer on multiple occasions.  3.  On the same topic of beer, their tap system was down after only my second beer.  4.  The beer menu, written on chalk boards, was too low and was either obscured by patrons along with being smudged making it difficult to read.  5.  We ordered wings and fries to start.  We asked for the wings to be extra crispy and grilled.  They came to us not crispy, slimy, and only half of them being grilled.  They had little flavor and was forced to use Pete's Hot sauce so they had at least some taste.  6.  We were so disappointed at this point we did not want to stay any longer.  We asked for our check and left after only 45 minutes.  **  We will never be back.   If you are looking for a better bar food restaurant experience in Cornelius I suggest Jack's Corner Tap or Harvey's.  **"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to friends.  My husband and I had company in from out of town last night and we ordered chicken quesadilla, shrimp quesadilla and wings.  The chicken quesadilla and shrimp quesadilla only had cheese and the meat. I don't know, other places I have gone have had tomatoes, onions, lettuce...I just expected more.  The wings, in my opinion, were soggy. I am not a fan of them."}
{"text":"I lived at Lake Norman from October 2005 until July 2015 (moved to Uptown) and still find an excuse to head up to LKN on Saturdays to hit Lake Town. They usually have a domestic bottle special but the real deal is either the $5 quesadilla or $5 nachos on Saturdays. I typically get chicken on the nachos (have never done the chili). The chips have a very light saltiness to them that is complimented perfectly by a side of sour cream and what I believe is an incredible homemade salsa. If you're with someone, order 1 of each and split each... you both will walk out stuffed. I've had their wings (good!) but always come back for the nachos. And for you wing nuts, I didn't know this but you can pay a small additional fee to have your wings breaded. We called these \"wing dings\" in the north and it really adds another level to a standard wing. The service here is consistently EXCEPTIONAL. If a waitress is busy, it's not unusual for the bartender to step out and come to your table to make sure you are taken care  of. It's one of the few places in all of Charlotte it feels like every single staff member cares about their reputation. The bands here are usually always good but don't expect to have a conversation here if you took someone here for a date night. It can get very loud in that room. Oh, and the pool table upstairs in the loft is always a nice departure from downstairs."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place but the servers are nice, food is very yummy, prices are cheap and there are many drink specials. They also have corn hole every day, as well as an upstairs seating area."}
{"text":"The beef sandwich is killer - If you don't like a loud environment with live music, stay away on weekend - If you do go have a drink and the sandwich"}
{"text":"Flies. Seriously. All on our food the whole time. 

Other than that...oyster basket good, asked for Xtra hot wings and they definitely weren't but still tasty."}
{"text":"Bartender Tab is extremely friendly and very people oriented. The food was great. I had the fish and grits. The wife had the waffle deluxe. Simply great. Thanks for the awesome service."}
{"text":"I tried the grouper, being very picky about fishy tastes.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It had great breading, wasn't greasy and tasted fantastic! The tater tots were also delicious.  The atmosphere was very upbeat and fun.  The owner Jeff is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.  The patio is a popular place, people were listening to a band out there which was great."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Small bar despite how big it looks from the outside. Smelly and on the dirty/old side. Service was a decent speed, but they don't come to refill or check on you unless you are buying another bottle at the bar. They have some bar games like darts and video golf. Overall, probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Very busy night for trivia.  Holiday weekend, that's understandable.  But management needs to hire more servers!  Food was excellent for bar food!  Only reason it's up to three stars not two"}
{"text":"Excellent service, very reasonable prices. Menu items are great.  Came in at breakfast, but wanted a burger. They made it for me, no questions asked."}
{"text":"Called in a take out order for breakfast. Was told to wait 20 minutes. Got to the restaurant and waited another 20 minutes. Asked for turkey bacon and got sausage. Should have told me that they were short a cook and that they could not do my order correctly or on time."}
{"text":"Quite a little fine and if your looking for a quick burger and fries, not half bad. I would stay clear of the onion soup since I have had better but the potato skins were quite nice. The staff is super nice as well and they have food specials all the time. /A nice local hang out . The popo always are around the corner though, so don't drink and drive"}
