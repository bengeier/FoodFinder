{"text":"Ok so I also used uber eats and was left extremely underwhelmed and slightly grossed out.  Immediately upon opening, I lifted up my burrito and there was a hair at the bottom of the box. Then my mangonada had bone dry, unripe, obviously old mangoes in it.  The aforementioned burrito was bland, more like dog food than steak. I think there was rice and beans in it also (I took one bite and threw it out) which was more of a greasy paste and the sour cream they put on the side was runny and looked like it had also been sitting out unrefrigerated for a while.  Altogether very unpleasant.  However, I also got elote in a cup and while I had to add my own Valentina, it's delicious. I mean cmon though, how do you mess up corn, mayo, and cheese?  Very simple and easily remedied errors (like care about the food you're serving and how it's being served) and I'm disappointed that I spent 20 bucks and wasted 45 minutes waiting, only to remain hungry."}
{"text":"Every time I visit this restaurant, I'm always satisfied. I usually order a carne asada burrito and although I'm very picky about my food, the friendly cashier was able to adjust my order to fit my needs. The meat is always cooked and flavored well. The customer service is also very inviting which is another reason why I come back on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"If i can do a quarter star i would!!!! Do not come to this place if you have nothing else to do that day...they take their sweet ass time and food is half par..NEVER AGAIN!!!  15-20 mintues for 2 burritos!!! COME ON!!!"}
{"text":"Most horrible raspados place ever!! They serve their elite cold, umm who does that... no juice in the cup, it was so dry. The mangos in the mangoniada were hard and not even yellow or juicy, they had like a white-ish tint to it. I wasted $11 on this place and ended up throwing both items away after a bite or two. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone! Never going here again"}
{"text":"Liars liars liars, I ordered a delivery (uber eats) there was ice cream everywhere, didn't receive the drink, or fries that I paid extra for!! It's on my receipt, and I called to ask how they planned to fix it, the response was a lie, and the burrito wasn't even, as they didn't even make the burrito how I asked to, will not order from them again"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here multiple times with UberEATS. The food has always been great! I love the mangoniada and the carne asada fries are delicious as well. I recommend trying it out. The burritos are huge!"}
{"text":"I work inside metro mall, and Mayas is one of 3 places in the food court I still enjoy. Sadly it has gone down tremendously in customer service and its quality in food. Except for the younger guy, the young pregnant lady, and the elderly cooks, the rest of the ppl working there are rude and have terrible customer service. Not to mention I literally have to come back to my work and wait 20 minutes to be able to go back up and actually pick up my food knowing I'm limited on time for my breaks."}
{"text":"Awful! Rude! Ordered a nacho supreme to go. When I got home, I saw nacho cheese on store bought chips with carne asada on top. The container was only partially filled. Nothing else. That isnt a supreme. I called to ask what was on the supreme and they explained it included onions, lettuce and sometimes cilantro.  I told him what I ordered and what I received. I told him that I was coming back for an exchange. He said ok. When I got there, he said that I asked to be charged for a supreme but that I didnt want anything but meat and cheese. REALLY? I told him, \"Do you understand how dumb that sounds?\" He said, \"Yes, I was wondering why you ordered it thay way, but thats what you ordered.\" I said to forget the food and that I just wanted my money back. He said they didn't give refunds. I told him he needed to refund me, that he took advantage of his customer and I was not the type of person to be taken advantage of. His grandmother was there working as well and asked what was going on. He started talking to her in spanish and after he started saying rude things in spanish about me, I finally cut him off and said, \"Look, I'm right here. I can understand what you are saying. I do understand quite a bit of spanish and I did NOT say to leave off everything that makes a nacho supreme a supreme!\"  He looked at his grandma, then at me...the he walked to his register and game me my cash back without a word. His grandma apologized in Spanish and I thanked her for her help. I will never be back! Maybe they only take advantage of orders to go? I dont know...but they are rude and make you fight for what you order! After all that, my son just told me that his egg, chicken and potato burro only had egg in it! I wish I had known, I would have asked for that refund too! Ugggggg!"}
{"text":"I see all the bad reviews and I just don't get it.  We ordered via uber eats and were very happy. The food and raspados were great!!"}
{"text":"I should've read review s before spending my $$ here. I order a mangonead and strawberry and cream. Mangoneada flavorless, bland had no taste very very disappointed. Pictures do look good but thats it. Fresa w/ cream they mix bad strawberry with good ones they did not bother to cut they just threw them in a cup with lechera. If I new I was getting this I would of done this at home but nicely cut with more cream. Will not come back to this place."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting. The tacos, which I ordered 3 kinds of, we're 3 sloppy tortillas with a tsp of meat each. Cold tostada that was soggy beneath the beans. This place is honestly a joke."}
{"text":"Worst food ever.   I ordered from Postmates, similar to Ubereats and when it was delivered the nachos were soaked in gross yellow cheese you get from a 711 or circle k.  The street tacos had a few pieces of meat, and the huge chicken taco was full of beans and rice and maybe 3 tiny pieces of chicken.   I would never order from here again and the only reason I ordered was because of the free shipping,  trust me not worth the free shipping."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE FOR ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF SNACKS!!  stumbled onto this place looking for the chick-fil-a (there's apparently not one in the mall any longer) and the couldn't resist the tasty looking pictures! So even though we were not craving Mexican, we were easily convinced...   ***DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE PICTURES!!!***  Even though the cashier was very nice and friendly, almost everything went wrong with our order... My wifey and I wanted \"Tortas\" because the picture looked most appealing... She asked if they used guacamole or avocado and the cashier said they were actually out of both,  so she changed her mind to two tostadas (also looking very appealing) one chicken, one steak. I ordered the steak torta combo... simple order? right....? HOW COULD YOU MESS THAT UP???  FORGOT:   1. Beans on the tostadas...  2. One chicken tostada, we got two beef 3. My combo, I had to wait for my fries and soda to be prepared  TASTE COMPLAINTS:  1. Steak was rough, chewy, and unseasoned 2. Fries were unseasoned, and salt and pepper was not available 3. We tasked for a water cup, she accidentally put coke in it, pored the coke out and gave us water with out even rinsing the cup... ewwwww!  I saw that other customers ordered snacks like fruit and chips that looked very appealing, but I will definitely not order a entree from here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered food from ubereats and it was gross. The salsa had a very bad aftertaste like dirty water or something. The chips were greasy and bleed thru the brown paperbag. The sauce was very very bland. The entrees were ok at best but I was grossed out from the salsa it turned me off, wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"First I want to mention I ordered this through Ubereats, sight unseen, and mistaken it for another Maya restaurant. If I read these reviews I would have never ordered from here.   First thing, when the driver arrived he told me that the staff wanted to let me know that they were closed and had to reopen just to make my food. Well, they could have called me and told me they were closed, or maybe, JUST MAYBE, turn off their Ubereats tablet. It doesn't matter anyways, because ANY good restaurants last plate of service is as good as its first.   Now lets talk about the horrible food.   I ordered the nachos as an appitizer, expecting to get the traditional freshly made chips with shredded cheese melted all over them with your usually accompaniments. Nope. Instead I got a box full of disgusting premade boxed chips covered in the same fake cheese sauce you get from the convience store. And the thing I don't understand, if you're doing delivery, why not put the nasty cheese sauce on the side so the cheap Restaurant Depot/Smart'n'Final chips don't get soggy.   Next is the carne asada, at least that's what they claim, it's hard to tell what kind of meat it really is. Absolutely no flavor, no salt, no marinade, no char. Nothing like carne asada. Served on a horrible greasy tortillas. Hey, guess what guys, you can get a grill scraper so your flat top doesn't have to look like a pool of old oil. Clean your equipment. It makes me worry about what their tongs and spatulas look like.   Finally, the chicken tacos. Just, wow... Thigh meat, which is usually good and stays moist was beyond repulsive. They did not clean any of the sinew so the chicken bits were stringy and stuck together. Also looked like a madman cut up the chicken, as it was not at all uniform, so you had extremely dry bits mushing around the other chicken. Served on the same nasty tortillas, with cilantro that was hardly cut and was very stemmy.   Got the aqua fresca and honeydew \"milkshake\". Those were good but I'm not giving them any points for being able to blend fruit, ice and sugar together.   All and all this has to be the worse restaurant I have ever had the opportunity to encounter. These people clearly have no pride and don't care about the food they serve. It's confusing why the owners would open a place up to be so mediocre. The restaurant industry isn't about bringing in tonnes of money, it's about passion and service. The owners here have tried to cut every corner possible and it shows. They should be embarrassed and I doubt this place will last much longer. I believe the only saving grace for them is they are located in the worst mall in Phoenix, Metro Mall, and the only thing that kept them afloat was the lack of competition. I hope this place shuts down as its an embarrassment to all restaurants and restaurateurs."}
