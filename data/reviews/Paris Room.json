{"text":"I went last week with my girlfriend and found it disappointing. We ordered the cheese and meat board. It looked like the crackers were from pepperidge farms. The cheeses and  meats where mediocre.  When I went to the restroom I passed the kitchen, no stoves, just  microwaves. It looked like a Subway on steroids. We decided to pass on dinner.  I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Cozy little place and big on flavor and service. Wednesday night was packed at 7pm so we waited to sit at the bar. Clam chowder was great and salad was included with dinners. Crab cakes we small but good and the crab stuffed sole was perfect. Both dishes were accompanied by grilled vegetables and potatoes. Portions were reasonable and prices matched. Home made apple cake for dessert."}
{"text":"So...... The cheeseboard was full of cheap cheese, none of which were French and had those cheap butterfly crackers, I'm not sure if I like that. Also, they have a bourbon glazed Salmon on the menu, not sure if that's a French delicacy but I could have gone to Applebee's and had the same dish, probably would have come out faster too. Duck sausage and lamb meatloaf were fine but nothing special- anyhow the place is about as French as Italy-service was fine"}
{"text":"So we've been going there off and on hoping for a table, always full and always a long wait.  Finally, the night of the snow storm we went there and scored a table.  Very full despite weather.  This is definitely tucked away in a basement!!  They didn't do a lot of renovations to make it a restaurant.  But it's quaint.  The staff is all over 30.  They seem genuinely interested in the place and the customers.  My teenager was being a typical teenager and refused to eat and try anything.  But then the bread came.... They say he was eating something and kept the bread coming!  The food was really good.  Friendly, good, and great service.  What else can one want for dinner.  Please don't go there though, because when we go, we'll never get a table, cuz the line is too long!!!  (-:"}
{"text":"How cute is this treasure, tucked away in Chagrin.  Very busy!  Need to get there early.  Quaint, charming, good food.  I agree reservations would be helpful!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute quaint place that you absolutely need to try if you haven't yet!  Just the fact the it can only be accessed from the backside of the falls sets the tone of atmosphere that this place creates. It really has that kind of hole in the wall feel and once you're inside the unique architecture makes it feel even so like you're underground!  There is a cute bar with only a few seats so it really creates a personal intimate feel which would be great for a date night or just enjoying some drinks before your meal. The seating in the rest of the restaurant is equally as intimate with its minimal but eclectic design that really invokes the spirit of Paris.   Their menu changes seasonally but my favorite is during the summer when they offer the Triffles chicken salad. It sounds like it would be rather simple, and it is, but it is also incredibly delicious and by far the best I've ever had.  To add to the amazing atmosphere that's created in here during certain hours they bring in musicians to offer live entertainment to accompany your delicious French inspired meal!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for some time now & I finally had the opportunity to step-in.  A lady i believe to be the owner/manager greeted us right away and gave us seating options.  We opted for the bar since we originally just wanted a drink.  My date got a Bombay sapphire cocktail & I had the Blueberry Collins. Both were very well made  After looking through the menu I noticed the Billie Holiday crab cakes and HAD to get them  I'm glad I did!  The atmosphere is right up my alley... dim lighting, brick walls, small bar & indoor-outdoor seating.  (Although, outdoor seating is beer & wine only)  The main issue I have was the service from the bartender who we had to flag down multiple times even though I was one of the four people at the bar.  She didn't really make me feel like \"I belonged\"  I've been in the food service industry for most of my life & understand that being busy translates into that feeling for some. However, it was evident in her smiling, taking pictures, making small talk and laughing with other patrons and her barely acknowledging my presence that made me feel this way.   Other then that my experience was near perfect."}
{"text":"Not enough food The mixed veggies were 3 green beans, a carrot, an olive, a cherry tomato and a small portion of fish I do not eat like a horse and am not fat where i require huge portions. This was ridiculous. This is not France where they always serve small plates The fish i had was just a little above average and the crab filling was better. Ambiance was very good."}
{"text":"Went to the Paris Room with friends last night.  The setting is charming, the food is delicious, and the service was attentive and pleasant.  This is a Chagrin Falls gem that merits a visit if you haven't been there, and a return if you have been there!"}
{"text":"There are many issues here. It basically comes down to terrible management. Let's start at the beginning: there aren't waitresses regularly checking on you, so it's necessary to go to the bar for some of your drinks. Once you do that, everyone is confused that you are paying for drinks sometimes at the bar, and sometimes through a waitress. Eventually, the owner will come up to you and ask, \"do we have a problem here?\" It turns out, the only problem is I am trying to spend money and you are making it difficult.  You do not feel like you are taken care of at this restaurant. It is very common to overhear the owner complain to her waitresses, \"the customers are so awful!!!\"... Customers saw me going back and forth so many times from our table to the bar, they started asking me to get their drinks too!! Everyone was dissatisfied, to put it kindly...The waitresses, bartenders, and cooks themselves are very nice. This is a management problem. It's a shame, because the place has a lot of potential. My issues are based on drinks only--- if you look below at other reviews, you will find the food is an entirely different (and perhaps bigger) problem."}
{"text":"We decided to take my mother out for Valentine's Day last night. We did not have a reservation anywhere so we specifically chose restaurants that do not except reservations like Paris Room. We arrived at 5:45 PM expecting a wait. Upon arrival there was a sign on the door that they were only serving people with reservations. It can completely contradicts what they advertise. We wound up having to eat hamburgers at yours truly as a result.  Either you take reservations, or you don't. You can't randomly choose when you will take reservations and when you won't and not announce it. Horrible experience and it makes no sense"}
{"text":"What a gem! Need to stop in and enjoy your favorite drink, Kasey will mix up any drink you can think off!"}
{"text":"Intimate and always reliable in service and food. The special jazz night was crowded and shared a table with others. Very friendly atmosphere. Also the jazz night is a set menu which was good  but not as good as regular evening food ordered in the past. It is a nice addition to the Chagrin Falls food scene."}
{"text":"Not a place to go as a single to relax at the bar. Couldn't get any attention and food service was slow. Finally left without being served my food order. Felt unwelcome."}
{"text":"Charming little place with hearty comfort dishes that could use a bit of ramping up on seasoning and service."}
{"text":"I had the short ribs my wife the wild sole. Both were excellent but smaller portions. I left full and would come back to try the lamb meat loaf"}
{"text":"We arrived for a happy hour yesterday. Started with the Manhatten and it was outstanding.  They have a very good selection of Bourbons and the drink was perfectly prepared by a warm and gracious bartender.  We ordered several appetizers and they were all delicious. Of special note was the pumpkin soup which was incredible.  My wife makes great soup and she agreed this version was better.  Thick and sweet but not overly sweet.  Served creatively in a coffee mug. I find this place to have the best ambiance in Chagrin Falls. Warm and cozy with no tv's. Great staff. Courteous and attending. We will be going back soon. Check it out."}
{"text":"Very crowded place.  After we finished dinner, people were coming in and the host asked me to \"get out of the way.\"  They were not very polite after you paid your bill.  Food has smaller portion, way overpriced for its ambiance and quality.  It is a place that is \"trying to look French.\"   It is more of a country restaurant with mommy's home cooking; portion could be increased.   Will never go back there again."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in Chagrin Falls - great ambiance in an unusual small space that feels very much like places we visited in France and Italy.  The entrees lean toward European comfort food - have had the salmon, meatloaf, sea bass special and short ribs and all were well prepared and delicious.  They also have regular musical entertainment which has been surprisingly good the few times we've been there on those nights (they don't take reservations so we tend to go early).  We've taken several friends and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Intimate setting. Delicious appetizers, meal(trout) and dessert(dark chocolate pie with toasted coconut). Relaxing music with keyboardist and the service was perfect.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Loved this little hidden gem! Great service food and ambience! It's very tiny but cozy. We got the mussels and escargot which were delicious. Don't miss out on the blue cheese butter and warm bread. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, excellent food, waitress seemed a little rough, waters were refilled but there were no pleasantries , small talk or even a smile, almost snobbish. Was suppose to have live jazz guitarist (it said so on the website) but when we arrived they said he was out of town, music choice was good initially (jack Johnson) but then they played heavy rock metal for a little while which was not pleasant. I have to admit, the food was amazing. The washroom was adorable, stone walls, hand painted red wooden table and a nice touch with fresh flowers. We will definitely go back, hopefully the guitarist will be there and the waitresses will be in a better mood."}
{"text":"Love this little place and it keeps getting better.  Food was quite good as was the service.  They don't take reservations so there can be a wait.  But the atmosphere is so quaint and cozy, that it is worth it."}
{"text":"We were very pleased with our first visit.  The food, space and service were excellent. One major complaint is they don't take reservations at this very small place.  We live a 20- 25 minute drive from here and I doubt we would often take a chance to go that far and not get in or have a long wait. Management needs to rethink this policy. Also their web site needs to show the menu.  We were hesitant to go as we were unsure what to expect. Second visit, everything was excellent, menu, food and service. Only complaint was the salad dressing was way too vinegary and off putting. All in all a very pleasant night. Also, the entertainment was at a quiet level that did  not over power the room."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at Paris Room. The atmosphere screams 1920s Paris and the food is absolutely delicious. The service was attentive and fast. All in all, one of, if not the best, restaurant in Chagrin. Looking for a special family night or romantic dinner? Head to Paris Room!"}
