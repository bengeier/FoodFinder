{"text":"Just what a neighborhood pizza place should be. Great food. Good prices.  Great staff."}
{"text":"Cosmo's is the best pizza in Murrysville. Fresh ingredients, fair prices, and a great local owner. Try their white pizza and Italian sub."}
{"text":"Wow! Cosmos. I guess it never occurred to me they would still be open and I was just perusing Murrysville restaurants. To say I was raised on Cosmo's pizza would be a stretch but...lets just say Cosmo helped me toward my first diet. The pizza is amazing and I honestly never even thought that it might still be open! I cant imagine it isn't as good as it was 30 years ago. Can't wait to eat it again when I go home."}
{"text":"The best pizza around this area. We ordered one with ground beef, mushrooms, onions, peppers. We did enjoy it. Recommend it to everybody!"}
{"text":"I have love love loved their pizza for years!!! I don't know what cheese they use, but it is simply the best!!! My parents got me hooked on this place!! I recently tried their meatball hoagie!!! I'm so glad I did. The meatballs were delicious, not frozen at all. I think they use the same delicious cheese as the pizza, and the bread was the perfect texture!! I don't yelp too much, but have to give credit to this wonderful place that I hope sticks around for years to come!!!"}
{"text":"To the eye, it's not much of a place. If you blink, you'll miss it. However, the food was really tasty. We ordered a medium pepperoni pizza and a footlong hoagie. It came to $17.00.   A couple things to consider. It is a cash only establishment and there is no delivery. I think that it keeps their costs down. Also, there is no breadsticks. If you go in knowing these things, you won't be disappointed when you're hit with that info. We gave it a shot, and I'm glad we did. We will be back."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall but beats out all local pizza shops and definitely beats the chain stores. Great pizza and hoagies at an even better price."}
{"text":"Friendly staff   Solid pizza.  Try the crumbled sausage topping. It's homemade and very tasty."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm doing this. But I just have to get this off my chest. I can't bring myself to get a pizza here because it is so overpriced. These are not speciality pizzas. They aren't fire grilled. There is nothing I can think of that would augment the price of the product. And yet, in Boston (with a cost of living comparable to NY,NY), you can buy an extremely tasty, thin crust, 16\" pizza with 3 toppings from a well known local chain for $12. Yours is $17.25. That is 43% more expensive. What's the deal guys?"}
{"text":"This pizza was awesome. Straight up pepperoni and mushroom. Delicious!!! I was in town visiting my Parents and ordered the \"PIE\". Found you all on Yelp. I like mine a little more well done and you made it perfect. Thank you Susan!!! Next visit back North I shall see you again."}
{"text":"If I could give Cosmo's 6 stars, I definitely would.  Cosmo's Pizza is without a doubt the best pizza in the country.  Let me tell you about my history with Cosmo's.  I grew up in Pittsburgh and my grandparents lived in Altoona.  Our family would drive to Altoona at least 2 weekends a month over about a 20 year period.  EACH AND EVERY TIME, we stopped at Cosmo's...on the way there, AND on the way back.  When we went in, my mom would give the owner a coupon literally dated from 1984.  Every time the Owner would accept it and hand it back to her as he knew we'd use it a couple days later on the way home.    The pizza is so good it's hard to describe.  The crust is the perfect texture.  The cheese melts in your mouth.  The sauce is tangy, not overly sweet as you get with many of the chains.  Simply put, it is the perfect pizza.  A few times I have gone to visit my parents in Pittsburgh from Los Angeles and have made them drive me about an hour to Cosmo's to get my favorite pizza ever.    A special thanks to the owners of Cosmo's for being such a big part of my childhood.  I think about you often and will continue telling everyone I meet that you have the best pizza in the USA!"}
{"text":"Well I'm going to look at Cosmo's from two different angles.  From a quality of pizza standpoint, it is by far the best pizza I've had in the area.  Crust was perfect, sauce was sweet, but not too sweet, cheese was excellent, and the pepperoni was incredibly fresh.    Now, I've just described an unbelievable pie, so right now you may be asking why not give 5 stars.  There are three reasons that I did not give cosmo's the coveted 5 stars.  Number 1 they do not sell breadsticks.  My family loves them and not having them on the menu makes zero sense for a pizza joint.  Number 2, cash only, kind of a pain.  Number 3, no delivery,  with small kids and limited time, delivery is nice.  If you can look past three minor inconveniences,  the pizza is well worth the short trip up route 22."}
{"text":"I have lived about 5 minutes from cosmos for years now and have never tried it before. Partly because there are so many good options also within 5 minutes and mostly because they don't do delivery. Well yesterday the lady and I wanted pizza and we were out and about so we called in for a large pizza. He told us 45 minute wait which for a place that doesn't deliver is quite a wait but it's worth it.   We got there a little early and had to wait 10 minutes or so and I was tempted to knock off a star because that pizza smells so darn good it was torture waiting. We managed to squeeze ourselves into the corner of the small pickup room with at least 8 other hungry customers.  The pizza was fantastic it was a thin New York style crispy, and topped with green peppers and onions. Because I knew 12 slice meant I was eating at least  10 slices I got a side salad. A side salad that I swear had a pound of cheese on top canceling out any chance I had at being healthy. Thick string cuts of provolone all mixed with iceberg lettuce and the crunchiest vegetables that just showed you how fresh the ingredients are at Cosmos.  Now as for the price a 12 cut 2 topping with my salad and the ladies salad was $20 even.  I will be back and next time I think I'll try a sub. Cash only and no delivery knock what would be 5 stars down to 4. And remember friends, I don't always review my food but when I do I prefer Yelp."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews. Hole-in-the-wall kind of establishment, but some of the best pizza I've ever had!! I was pretty stunned!! Nowhere to sit and eat in...it's a take out place. Guy working there was awesome and honest. 30 min wait, but it was worth it. Nice job Cosmo!"}
