{"text":"Ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl. It literally had 3 small pieces of chicken in it. Mostly rice with overly salty teriyaki sauce. For 14 dollars it was underwhelming . I would never return ."}
{"text":"Outstanding! We were here less than a week into opening for a birthday celebration and they were already in sync with the pacing, service, and food. I didn't like a cocktail so it was replaced without charge. The food was largely outstanding. Next time I'm gonna order a bucket of the crispy shrimp for myself. Steamed buns, ramen, sushi, and crudos were all great and I cannot wait to go back"}
{"text":"Nice bowl of ramen.  Tried the obon and the tonkatsu. Happy hour specials $2 off.  Stylish, clean and spacious.  Would come back again for a try of their sushi."}
{"text":"Horrible! The steam buns were awful, not even warm. Sushi was average. Noodle dish was horrid, even my not picky husband wouldn't eat it. The server was super nice though. It's such a cool looking place but I don't think it will survive with mediocre food."}
{"text":"I am only giving this \"sushi\" bar a 2 because the service was much better than the food. I had the poke bowl. The fish was completely flavorless & @ $17, I would expect at least a little taste of something. Good thing I am on a diet!"}
{"text":"Weak! Menu sucks like the food but people were nice. Save your date night for elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and exceptional food. I have yet to find anything on the menu that isn't absolutely delicious. Best sushi in the valley in my opinion and the ramen exceeded expectations. The new cocktail menu has some of the most creative drinks (my personal favorite being the Creatures Comfort) and I was relieved the Machi is still being offered. It's one of the BEST well-balanced cocktails I've had. The staff always goes above and beyond...everyone is super friendly and attentive. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best ramen experiences I have had. After being greeted by the hostess, we were promptly seated. Our waitress was Jessica and she quickly brought us water after introducing herself and providing a menu. 

They menu is broken up into a few sections that offer small plates or ramen or steamed buns or sushi rolls. 

I had the Obon Ramen along with the Spam and Pork Steamed buns and Monster Sushi roll. They brought out the food as it was prepared which was nice since the steam buns came out first followed by the Ramen and finally the sushi.  It was all brought out at a good pace where we weren't rushing to finish one thing or having to wonder when the next item would come out. 

Normally a place that offers such a variety of various foods would not excel since their menu is so wide spread. However this place had their menu options very well dialed in on flavors. The Pork Steam bun was the best of the two as the pork belly was melt in your mouth, very flavorful and juicy.  The Obon Ramen was also very good. It contained what they called a 64 degree egg which gave you the creaminess of the egg without being runny. The pork belly was also very delicious and melt in your mouth. 

After having our meals, Tony came out and talked with us for a while. We discussed how they have been open for about a week and the various things that they do and try to incorporate into their menu and about the chefs and selection on how to put menu items together.  It was a great was to end the night after such a filling meal and have a good experience to be able to talk with him."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant after my friends gave such rave reviews of the Tucson location. Unfortunately, I was less than impressed.  The food was delicious but the service was horrible.  My table got a signature roll and bowl of ramen,  but I was not offered soy sauce. I asked for a bowl to share the ramen and was ignored.  The waitresses were MIA throughout my visit.

No matter how much I enjoyed the food, I can't get over the lack of service. I will be scratching this place off the list of places to eat."}
{"text":"Decided to take a drive 15 min away for some sushi. Walk around the block to find it. Greeted by friendly staff.  Ordered the HAFU roll, OBoN ramen and the RAINBOW poke bowl. Food was excellent. The HAFU roll was fresh and delightful. Ramen was tasty and done perfectly. Very happy with our overall experience especially since we get some of the freshest fish back home.  Would definitely come back again...!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience out on the patio at Obon. Although the A/C unit on the building next door was loud when it came on (several times during our meal), that was the only negative to speak of. Our server was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. He provided excellent suggestions based on asking us questions about our preferences. The sushi was great and the cocktails were interesting and tasty. We finished with a sampling of the steamed buns. We tried the softshell crab and the spam with kimchi. Both were very, very good."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go for your sushi fix. The waiter, Brandon, was extremely helpful and helped us pick some great dishes. Wish it was closer to my house to go all the time"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in town. They use an infusion of traditional Japanese sushi techniques like bonito and daikon atop the sashimi. You can also taste the care the chef takes in each piece. It's not just cut and slapped on some rice. Beyond all of this you can taste a South American twist on all of the dishes. 

I have to mention the meat buns. When in Japan my favorite thing to eat was nikuman. The bun itself is hard to do so I was excited to see a completely different take on them here. Absolutely fantastic. 

There are some roll options for the people who want them but a lot of the negative reviews also have positive ones for buffet sushi. Not to be taken seriously, in my opinion. 

I have not tried the ramen yet but have seen people comparing it to instant ramen. That's an outright lie from what I saw at the table next to me. 

Everywhere else uses Aji no moto."}
{"text":"This is our first time. We had sushi and sashimi plates for lunch. Came with rice and misu   soup and salad A couple of ipa's on draft to compliment the meal. Perfect!!  A kala draft really hit the spot.  Our server Jessica was terrific very cool and lots of shopping in the quarter. Great experience and super menu.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Obon had great food and a very nice environment. Our favorites were the Tataki Maki, Strip rolls, the crispy calamari salad, and Obon Edamame. The prices are somewhat high with three people for lunch including drinks running about $100 but the quality makes it worth it. Grace our server was excellent and the chef made a special side of Kimchi for one of our party that was really good. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Great ramen and amazing service from  from Hayden.
Definitely would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I patronized this place for the first time on 8/31/17. I had a very good meal, along with very good service. I paid with my debit card. The restaurant withdrew from my checking account MORE than I authorized. When I became aware of this \"discrepancy \", on 9/9/17, I immediately called Obon. I spoke with the Manager Tony, whose first response to me was \"It's the lunch hour and we are very busy\". I lodged the dispute and Tony took all of my information and said he will take care of it and get back to me. In fact he stressed that this may take a little while but he would definitely get back to me. Nearly a month from our conversation Tony has not taken care of it. Accordingly I had to lodge a dispute with my bank.
BUYERS BEWARE! Keep your receipts and reconcile it against your accounts. I will never patronize this place again and have already informed friends, family and colleagues to follow suit."}
{"text":"Wonderful food awesome service. Ask for Grace... She trully knows how to make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner while waiting for an order at a store in the quarter. Patrick was amazing and had a great sense of humor. We ordered the fuku wings, pot stickers and oban ramen. The ramen bowls were huge and tasty. The appetizers were delicious. I'm still washing the wing sauce out of my fingernails.  The atmosphere was actually very nice considering it was a Saturday night. It wasn't over-crowded or loud. Would definitely come back. Thanks for the great experience Patrick!"}
{"text":"Best new place on Scottsdale. Ramon is out of this world. Friendly  staff awesome atmosphere. The sushi rocks and the appetizers are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great first visit to Obon, enhanced by the excellent guidance of our server, Juan. The Street Noodles were great and having the sauce on the side let each of us enjoy the heat level we wanted. The Yellowtail crudo was nicely sauced and the Mataki roll was good. Will be back to try the buns."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is super friendly and the management really takes time to stop by and make sure you are enjoying your meal. The bathrooms are super clean and the music playlist is great. I've been in to eat over 15 times and never once has a server taken more than a few minutes to get to me and get me started. The owner I believe was there and came by and really made sure I was enjoying my experience. OBON and staff are great. Yelp sucks."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, right when you walk in the atmosphere instantly sets the mood, their sushi is to die for btw. My boyfriend and I split a monster roll and got the Obon ramen and it was some of the best I've had in the valley. 10/10 would def recommend."}
{"text":"Yummmm! I'm happy to have a sushi restaurant in the quarter again! OBON is cute and trendy. I've had a couple rolls and the peppers. I enjoyed them all. My boyfriend got the steam buns as an appetizer and said they were delicious. I've been a couple times now and will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in this afternoon for a little happy hour action. While pricey for happy hour, we have to remember that it is Scottsdale Quarter. We each ordered a drink, the hubs had Sapporo and I had some kind of delicious shandy with soju which definitely packed a punch. We then ordered the kimchi fried rice with banchan, yellowtail crudo, and Tataki Maki. All were delish! The kimchi fried rice had just the right amount of spicy heat and was a very generous portion (looking forward to the leftovers for lunch!). I would have preferred a protein other than Spam (or none, for that matter), but I was able to pick around the large chunks to leave them for the hubs. The yellowtail crudo was on point. I could have sipped up its leftover yuzu sauce with a straw. Yum. Lastly, the tataki maki roll was a splendid combination of shrimp tempura, crab, and cucumber, topped with a surprisingly delightful juicy grape tomato slice, fresh tuna, micro basil, and a chimichurri sauce. So many different flavor profiles, but it worked! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I was really excited when this restaurant opened, especially so close to my house. However, it's so gentrified... which works for the area that it opened in. The meat in the ramen tasted artificial. We tried the kimchi fried rice, which we found out that it was kimchi-FLAVORED fried rice instead. The miso soup didn't even have tofu in it, but rather tiny little bits where you can't even taste it. Definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"Wow. I'd been to the Tucson location but tonight was the first time at the new Scottsdale location and it was great! From the calamari appetizer to the sushi to the steamed buns...delish! Service was impeccable. Street noodles and ramen for main dishes. Our server said they're revamping their menu and it will be out this Friday. Just another excuse to go back and enjoy this place again!!"}
{"text":"Trendy but sub-par sushi as far as freshness and flavors.  Ramen was decent but that was all that was good.  Even wasabi was runny. Ok for maybe a quick bite but their are far better sushi places with much higher standards."}
{"text":"Loved the veggie ramen and veggie rolls. My server informed that these can both be done vegan which I really appreciate. The wines and beers are tailored to pair well with the food selections, and the cocktail list is doubly impressive. Ambiance and service were great - I especially enjoyed the reggae playlist.

See you again soon..."}
{"text":"OBON was a mediocre experience for me. As a sushi/ramen fanatic, I had high expectations walking into such a nice establishment with a great ambience. My server was knowledgeable and attentive and so were the staff. However the food was just not up to standards. I don't mind it being expensive, I just expect quality if I'm paying a premium price. I ordered a few entries on the menu to try and my favorite was the steamed bun sliders. I will be back to try more in the future!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time and really enjoyed it. The rolls were excellent, with a creative mix of ingredients. For example the maki roll with its Asian chimichurri and grape tomato. The Malbacore was also a delicious and well balanced mix of flavors. We also tried the bird and crab steamed buns which were savory and satisfying. During happy hour some of the items are a couple dollars off. In addition to great food,  the service was great, and the interior design is nice. It's a refreshingly minimal and modern space with subtle Asian influence and thoughtful attention to detail."}
{"text":"Ramen was average, ambiance is very nice inside. Menu offers sushi, apps, and ramen. Happy hour is $2 off red items on menu!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing !!! Came here and got veggie ramen, crab steam bun, and yuzu yellowtail .... seriously so good!"}
{"text":"Can't say anything but positives for this place it's  our new favorite ramen spot, sushi is good too and everything is reasonably priced. Ross waited on us and he was awesome he was clearly busy but handled it like a pro attentive chatty and genuine it's people like this that keep customers coming back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ramen in Arizona. Been across Asia and lived there for sometime. It's the closest comparison to the original."}
{"text":"Great ramen.  Best in Scottsdale.  I have been to Tokyo and it's pretty close to authentic.  Owner is very personable.  Will come here for my ramen fix"}
{"text":"First of all I am Korean 100% percent and I am from Korea.  

Not happy at all with the food and I would not even recommend anyone of my friends to go there to Korean food because It's NOT Korean what so ever!!!! I wish the restaurants would stop trying to introduced Korean dish if they're not going to do it right. It's deceiving people Who don't know the Korean food. We had Edamame papaya salad to cold Korean kimchi noodles and we also had the steam buns with spam kimchi, pork and  in and also bibimbap. The restaurant even spell bibimbap wrong. It's BIBIMBAP NOT BIBIMBOP! Their price is way too expensive I can get a lot better food paying half the prices."}
{"text":"Wanted to give 3 stars on first visit, but before I was done Tony came and chatted with me. Pork bun is different style, which I can't say I didn't expect in Scottsdale, flavors were good still. Came for ramen and tried signature Obon option, broth is bland but pork belly was packed with flavor. Was told they are working on the broth still, I'll blame the water for now as even a glass of ice water tastes off. Will try tonkotsu in a week or so."}
{"text":"It's fancy and has great service. 

Too bad the ramen was so bland. I like their pork Baos though. Otherwise I will stick to Tampopo's (in Tempe) Ramen!"}
{"text":"Bad news first: it's a little pricey. But god damn, does this place have the best ramen and more in Arizona. 

First you gotta order a drink, and lo and behold I see Hentai in the wild. I'm already a fan of old fashioned, but the meme level hilarity made me order that without question. Arguably, squid ink really does work, plus you gotta love the added touch of a well-suited Pokemon card.

But man, it's all a kids meal compared to the ramen. I got the OBON since I'm a big fan of the black garlic. You have the rich, fatty tonkotsu broth that you'd want from a hearty bowl. The pork was all super succulent and flavor. The MVP is clearly the egg - which was a perfect marriage between an onsen and soft-boiled egg. I first balked at how someone would pay $1.50 for an extra egg, but since this is the BEST EGG EVER I've experienced in ramen, I would clearly do it. The serving size is pretty generous to boot as well.

Some of the tapas are good as well. I was a big fan of the baos - the soft shell crab in that pillowy bun was a great appertif. I'm sad my phone died halfway through for pictures, but I can't wait to bring friends here for round 2."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Calamari and edema was appetizers were the best! Joe was attentive and made sure everyone left happy."}
{"text":"OBON opened about two weeks ago in the Scottsdale Quarter directly across from Dominick's Steakhouse. This was my first visit and certainly will not be my last. I would go as soon as you can because once the word gets out about OBON I expect it to become very popular, very quickly. They are on OpenTable. I sat at the bar and Devin & Brandon were great! I also spoke with Matt who genuinely cares about all aspects of your experience. I have been to many restaurants in the valley with great food but with a staff that prevents me from returning. OBON is NOT one of those places the staff is great and so is the food! I had two selections of the Steam Buns. The Crab and the Pork. The flavors and textures are fantastic, so much so that I had a second order of each. I also enjoyed their specialty roll, Shiro Maki. I would strongly recommend against using any soy sauce with this roll since it would mask the flavor explosion in your mouth as well as the amazingly delicate texture that melts in your mouth. I guess you can tell I am a fan of OBON, especially since it's an Arizona brand that started in Tucson. Do yourself and your taste buds a favor and get over there as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Coming from the west coast, it's hard to find good sushi in Az, let alone a unique dining experience. This place hits every note. From the service, to the quality, and to its unique character. Probably one of my favorite moments here is watching the bartender, aka master tender, make a cocktail. You do not see someone that puts so much effort and knowledge into a drink. Then to top it off with a lil mini clothespin attaches with a Pokémon card. So cute! Everything you eat is good here, every one working there is so nice, and not just to me, across the board. Consistency is KEY and they set the bar for the industry. You'd be crazy not to try this place! Freshest sushi I've ever had in phx!"}
{"text":"I've been to Obon a few times now and enjoyed every experience. We recently met friends there for dinner and decided to just go wild and share serval dishes on the menu. The sushi was on point and supper fresh. The server convinced me to try the Ramon and I'm so glad he did because it is delightful! In addition to having a great meal, we also really enjoyed the service and the vibe! Will definitly continue to go back!"}
{"text":"First time there and would definitely go back. Sushi was delicious. My favorite was the specialty yellowtail nigiri, melted like butter. Cooked items were very tasty as well, especially the steamed buns. Great ambiance and good service. Japanese whisky list was a little brief but good and there were some Taiwanese whiskey as well."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. Great service and the food excellent!  We ordered a little of everything on the menu.  I like how they served each item right away so you enjoy the food while it's hot.  We went for a late night dinner and I would like to go back for lunch and enjoy patio dining next time. Long drive from Gilbert but worth the drive."}
{"text":"Service is a toss up, depending on whether you get an experienced or new server. Better food and prices elsewhere. It is open on sundays and mothers day."}
{"text":"The Service was extremely slow, they had to remake my drink three times. They couldn't get it right.  I finally had to ordered a completely different drink. The sushi is less than mediocre. Not worth the stop.


Dear Brandon,

We didn't modify the sushi. We ordered as is!!Sorry to break it to you, but I'm NOT one of those people, your restaurant isn't all that.  I've worked in the restaurant industry and the service was less than par, especially when it was dead. Bashing your customers is exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant that doesn't have its shit together. I give that place six months tops!!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for ramen yesterday so we decided to give this place a try. 

Here are the things we ordered: Hentai Old Fashioned, Pork Gyoza, the Obon Ramen and the Rebel Without a Job (sushi roll). 

At the bar, they had anime playing on the TV. I thought it was a bit odd. We were hoping for some sports... or anything else.

The Hentai Old Fashioned was something my fiance ordered. My liver needed a break after the long Thanksgiving weekend. I took a sip of it and the flavors of the apertif and other ingredients were a bit overpowering over the whiskey. It reminded me a lot of a Chinese grass jelly dessert. 

The Pork Gyoza was tasty but nothing about it stood out compared to gyoza we've had elsewhere. It was good though and perfect for sharing. 

The Obon Ramen was probably one of the best bowls I've had in Arizona.  Pricey for a bowl of ramen but it's not going to stop me from getting it again. It was happy hour when we were there - our gyoza and sushi roll was happy hour items. I'd skip the roll we got - I was expecting something with more of a kick or something to stand out but it was just a typical role with a name that I didn't understand. What's the correlation? Maybe it's an anime thing. With everything we ordered and after taxes, our bill came out to $47ish.

I wasn't taken away by this place but it's close to home and they have a good bowl of ramen so I'll be back."}
{"text":"At first I thought this place was pretty expensive, but when we got our meals, they're like for 2 people! So pay double to get double ;) We got the pork belly ramen noodles and the kimchi and spam fried rice. The fried rice sounded so strange to have not only kimchi, but spam? It was so delicious- Oh my goodness!!!! So freaking good! I would def get it over the ramen bowl, but the bowl was good too, just a LOT of noodles."}
{"text":"We were definitely happy with the service at the bar area. We came by during the happy hour special this weekend but found that the happy hour selection was pretty limited (only items highlighted in red on the menu were on the menu). The Korean Soju was a pretty good cocktail with its citrus flavor.  We first got 3 different rolls: the Monster, Tataki, and the Strip. Presentation was good and the flavor matched its unique presentation. The servers always made sure we had the necessary condiments. Bartenders were attentive and we didn't have to wait very long for food. We also got the Obon Ramen which is on happy hour. Broth was a bit on the salty side, noodles didn't taste like instant and the pork belly was tender. Only negative comments are that we were asked if we wanted edamame (which is usually free at other Japanese restaurants) and we were not told that we would be charged $8. Also make sure to check bill if you go on happy hour because we nearly did not get discount for the ramen. Additionally the napkins were not clean and there are NO LOCKS in the bathroom.
Overall good food experience and service."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen and the steamed spam bun was so delicious. I have only been once but I will for sure be going back. I loved the atmosphere staff and the food was to die for."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Ramen restaurant but today's experience, for me, was less than desirable. I sat at the bar and ordered my go to dish but when I looked up, there was someone's ball cap sitting on top of the bar right next to where I was eating. Maybe I'm a germaphobe but I don't see where a used ball cap belongs on the eating area. I asked the bartender to remove it but all he did was move it a foot further away from me. I know it wasn't a pair of shoes or something really disgusting but I would expect more out of this establishment. Other issues are the notebook computer, cellphone and wallet sitting next to the ball cap from what I assume is the managers. I would sure think they have an office to work out of instead of taking up one of the limited bar seats and using the bar as a storage and workplace."}
{"text":"I was visiting some friends in town and decided to go to OBON for some Sushi and drinks. We  really enjoyed the food. Brandon, the bartender, mixed some great cocktails for us and made sure we had a great time."}
{"text":"Amazing! Cool vibe .....If you're tired of the same old sushi, OBON is a true delight. Great service from our hostess Ashley and server Jessica. I'm a cosmo snob and I had one of the best ever! Don't miss out on the dessert, you'll regret it!!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner in a Saturday. Resveration recommended. Great little bar area and some interesting drinks. We moved to our table dinner. They did try to seat us at a booth table for three for four of us but we just grabbed a chair for more room.  The ordered steam pork buns and the crab buns which were delicious. We also had crispy shrimp which was yum as well as the fukushu  (sp?) Roll. (We did have to adk to wasabi and ginger.) Both very good. Lastly we ordered the Obon ramen which was good. We felt the broth needed a little more flavor and my dad enjoyed the teriyaki. It is a bit pricey but most sushi places can be.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The ramen here is absolutely delicious. It's a little more on the expensive side but you can really taste the quality. The broth is very flavorful for the tonkotsu. This location is located in Scottsdale Quarters and it's one of my favorite places to be. I've taken two friends here on different occasions and they both really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my ramen bowl and Obon. There was not very much meat in my bowl, but the broth was very flavorful. The restaurant itself is very cool. Indoor/outdoor seating at the Scottsdale quarter makes it a great place to eat to people watch."}
{"text":"Bottom line: good food, great ambiance and service, try it!

The hubby and I came on a Wednesday night. It was surprisingly busy which is always a good sign.  We had made reservations for a table outside which was ready for us when we arrived.  It's casual but cool. Hubby strolled in a shorts and flip flops and no one gave him a second glance.

We ordered drinks (shiso mojito and creature comforts) which were interesting and delicious.  We got buns to start (chicken and pork - I liked the chicken better and hubby liked the pork).  We also tried 3 different sushi rolls which were all tasty.  There were also plenty of nigiri/sashimi options which we didn't try.  Also heard the ramen is really good but that's for next time.  Both the buns and sushi hit all the traditional flavors you expect but redone for an contemporary American palate. It's yummy either way.  The owner offered us tiramisu made with some miso which was unexpectedly amazing!  Don't freak out about the miso; it's like the salt in salted caramel.  Must order if available!

Service was a bit slow for a weeknight but like I said, it was busier than I would have thought for a weeknight. The owner, who was there that night, came by to personally apologize for the wait in getting our food and took care of us.  Even though there was a slight wait for our sushi rolls to come out, this place still knows customer service better than most other restaurants at the same price point.  Compared to other sushi offerings in the north Scottsdale/Desert Ridge area, this is one of our new favorites!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Sushi were lucking flavor. Other items were way to salty. Service was good."}
{"text":"Nice place for Japanese (a bit Americanized) food. It's kinda izakaya style, but more trendy modern. Delicious sushi, ramen, fried shrimp. Sashimi is good too. A bit pricy, but worth the value."}
{"text":"It was a bit of a surprise how much I enjoyed OBON.  It appears on the outside to be to \"trendy\" to offer good food and great service, however I had a great experience. I had the bird steamed bun which was sweet, spicy and crispy. $5 for one bun is a bit much though. The ramen was on point with the tonkatsu being rich and well seasoned. I could always have more noodles but it is a health portion.
Great hospitality and prompt but not rushed service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here!! Definitely the best sushi and ramen in the area! The service is incredible, and the servers are attentive and knowledgeable about the menu! My favorite dishes so far are the Fukushu signature roll, the Tonkotsu ramen and the Jalapeño Albacore crudo! I highly recommend trying some of the drinks too! The cocktails I've tried are unique and delicious! Plus the location is convenient and the parking garage is literally right behind the restaurant! Overall great experience and would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I went when they just opened, even though they just opened, they seemed to have everything organized and working smoothly. The food was very good with larger portions than I thought. I had the ahi tuna salad, the dressing was very good and there was a lot of tuna in it. My husband got a noodle dish and the portion was large and was very tasty. I would definitely recommend this place and will be going back."}
{"text":"Rating 3.5 stars. Decor is very modern, swanky. Ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, Kimchi Fried Rice and Tataki Maki Sushi. Ramen wasnt too bad, probably would go back for it. Kimchi fried rice was definitely large enough to share. Tataki Maki was okay, expected it to be full of flavors with the marinated tomato and chimchurri sauce but taste was subtle which highlights the shrimp and tuna. Service was great, very friendly."}
{"text":"Ramen noodle is way too over cooked but other than that, it's pretty decent place. 
I only wish the price is more reasonable for the quality of their food."}
{"text":"One of the owners went out of his way to fix an issue I had.  I was so impressed in hearing from someone who understood the importance of LTV (Life Time Value) of a customer: I will continue to spend my money here.  The food is great and the service is wonderful. The decor is beautiful and well-thought out.  Wishing this restaurant continued success"}
{"text":"Was out shopping at the Scottsdale Quarters with my sister on a Saturday afternoon. She saw OBON was finally open and told me it was ramen, I told her I had never had it before. So we went...although we had to wait a few minutes before our waitress came to help us she was great. We got the crispy shrimp appetizer. That had a slight kick to it. We had the crab steam bun and the pork belly steam bun both were delicious. And we got the shoyu ramen. Our waitress was so accommodating to us, we told her we were sharing everything so she had the kitchen split it for us.  As soon as a dish came out, 5 minutes later, she came back to check on us. For my first ramen experience, I cannot wait to eat more ramen."}
{"text":"The food and service was great. Brandon made the experience enjoyable with his professionalism, propmt service and great personality. Will be delighted to dine there in the near future!"}
{"text":"Nice place and stuff was very accommodating last minute. Rolls also priced great. 
Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Went to OBON for the first time today.  The service was NOT good.  I got my mediocre sushi & finished it while my husband waited for his meal.  We HAD to ask about his order.  The waiter's reply was \"Oh, it should be coming.\"  This whole time he had not checked on the order.  He comes back with the computer became unplugged & it's coming.  We couldn't wait because we had to pick up our granddaughters.  The only positive is they picked up the tab.  The waiter could not understand that he should have been checking on our order.  Needless to say, we will not go back or recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very good food; excellent imaginative dishes but don't come looking to medium to lower cost options. It's worth the expense! The SPAM steamed buns were excellent! Four choices and I had three of them! All tasty and well executed!!"}
{"text":"Food is home and adventure for me. So naturally, I am drawn to explore any ramen spot that pops up. Nestled in the busy and happening area of the The Quarter, Obon is addition and surprise for this foodie zip code. Beautifully remodeled, management also plucked the pretty people to work here. Came here during lunch and every seat almost taken, we managed to snag a spot on the patio. Note to staff, heaters aren't needed in AZ when the sunshine is a warm 75. Service was a little spotty for the food but our server was friendly and warm. 

The menu is simple enough with 15 being the lucky number on most items. You have a variety of steam buns, ramen and sushi rolls to salivate over. We opted for the shoyu ramen and fukushu sushi roll. The serving bowls belied the content. The broth is good but not enough to make up for the lack of enoki mushrooms and scantly piece of pork shoulder. It took about 20 minutes before we got our sushi roll which was pretty delish. My belly was disappointed and still hungry. I'll cheer on any new foodie spot, particularly a ramen one. You won't be my first choice on the dance card but good thing you have happy hour too."}
{"text":"Bad service! Server never showed up and we left. They seated us in a dark corner of the patio and the host didn't  move us when we asked her even though there were empty tables."}
{"text":"Just had lunch today at Obon!! Outstanding food!  The Strip Sushi roll is amazing!! The chicken fried rice was to die for!! The Chicken ramen was nothing like the Top Ramen from college days!! A thick broth with tons of noodles, egg, scallions, and sooo much more!  The steamed buns fried chicken and soft shell crab were quite good as well!  Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Well the service was above par, the staff was good looking, was a little loud, the restaurant is well decorated and the food i had was fantastic!!!! Started with the spam steamed bun and it was awesome! so awesome i convinced the couple next to me to order one because they saw mine and they loved it too! then i got the tonkatsu ramen and mama mia that was one of the best ramen soups i have ever had! asked the waiter for some heat and he brought me a teeny tiny spoon of some tasty hot sauce and it was perfect. My water was always full, the food was fantastic, the service was timely and the price is not bad for being in a pricey area. I shall go back for sushi and another bun. Keep up the good work and keep hiring all the pretty people! haha"}
{"text":"Tried the Ramen noodles and enjoyed it very much. Will be back to try the other dishes for sure. They need a karaoke night and this place will take Japanese dining in North Scottsdale to a whole new level"}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic staff!  Pablo was so helpful on our arrival to make sure we found it. We met our neice there, she recommended  it and very glad we did. Don't  miss the opportunity  to try Obon you won't regret!"}
{"text":"Street noodles, edamame, and Fukuhashu roll were amazing. Nicer restaurant, recommend reservations. Brought our kids, no kids menu but split a regular teriyaki chicken and took home left overs after kid stuffed their faces. Huge portions, Will be back for ramen"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good Ramen spot in the area this is the place. Awesome menu! Ramen, sashimi and happy hour were awesome! On top of that the ambiance was super chill and the playlist created a chill and fun vibe. Staff was very friendly and went above and beyond. Def coming back."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here!  Everything from the food to the service was amazing. Our server was very attentive to our table and super friendly. The food was fantastic... ramen, steam rolls, and sushi!  All super yummy!"}
{"text":"Ramen here is pretty good, the noodles aren't amazing but the broth is really delicious. However, I feel that a bowl of ramen this expensive should be all around excellent. It is just soup."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Their Ramen is delicious, and even better are their craft drinks and sake's. I went with a friend, we sat outside and we loved the ambiance and service as well. Their menu is full of the right items so I can't wait to be back to try them all out. The.egg on top of the ramen I ordered was perfectly cooked, and most definitely not complaints."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place. I haven't been to the one in Tucson but it's the same owners. Congrats on the Scottsdale location. 

I've been here three times in the last 10 days and I think the food is great, the ambience is very clean, and the service has been terrific. I remember Grace and Maddi and I'm so sorry I forgot the first one who served us. All three ladies very fun, smiling, actually were real and engaging in conversation. It helps with everything and I enjoyed it even more. 

To see all the stuff I got just look at my pictures but I haven't been disappointed at all and have had several items on the menu. My favorite and new love is shishito peppers and in the sauce they do is pure bliss. I also like the steam buns. The crab and bird were both great. Street noodles are a hit. 

If you are with someone, I would suggest getting a bunch of food and sharing to experience all. I will obviously be back to feast. And ask your server what's good they haven't steered me wrong and they know their stuff."}
{"text":"This place had the WORST service. My server Juan took 10 minutes just to greet us. My food was not even even close to be exceptional. DO NOT RECOMMEND. My review is further amplified by the disappointing reply from management. See below"}
{"text":"First time tonight at OBON with my son.  The service was very attentive .   My son ordered the OBON ramen with
Pork belly and pork shoulder he said the dark broth was rich and the soft cooked egg was cooked perfectly .
I had the tonkotsu ramen and the porky broth was rich and heavenly.  The soft cooked egg in addition to the pork slices and fish cake slice and bamboo shoots was perfection.  The ramen noodles were springy to bite and wonderful ."}
{"text":"Service was quick for lunch hour. Sat at the bar and the bartender was very alert and active for my service. Sashimi was the lunch special and it came our fresh. Even the wasabi cleared everything up. Enjoyed this place a lot. Ever in the Scottsdale area, swing by."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the service at the bar area! The bartender is clearly very passionate about his job. Not only did he make a really nice drink ( I got the Machi), he also had me sample other stuff.Did you know there is a whiskey distillery in Tucson and they smoke their malt with mesquite?  I also tried the Korean Soju which can be a pretty refreshing cocktail. 

Anyways, I went with the veggie ramen bowl and I was not disappointed. The miso broth is very flavorful with perfect amount of noodles and veggies. If you like a little extra spice in your food, ask for their house habanero hot sauce. It is delicious!

You can also get any ramen vegetarian style and add fried tofu. The staff was so nice and attentive. The ambience is very calm and there is outside seating area! This new ramen spot is what Kierland needed. I highly recommend their drinks and ramen. I will definitely go back to try other stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"First I'd like to recognize truly caring staff member.  I arrived after a LONG week to take my mom, aunt and GF out to a decent sushi dinner.  It was a Friday night and I didn't have reservations so of course there was a wait.  At first I said, no we'll move.  I walked out and one of the guys ran out to ask if I wanted to take a table outside.  I mean who does that?  Guy cared enough to run out and offer another option?  Pretty spectacular service and gesture there. 

We ended putting our name on the list and came back.  Place is nice inside, server was very attentive and friendly.  

The food was really nothing to write home about although the fried calamari came on a bed of salad that had a sauce that was to die for. The Tonkotsu Ramen was one step above cup-a-noodle ramen.  I prefer in house made noodles, but maybe I've been spoiled by NYC ramen places and Tampopo in Tempe.  The Monster Roll was decent, but again nothing special.  The Shiro Maki roll had this very off tasting lime sauce over it that no one at the table liked.  Had the Little Lilly Sake which is a great sweet cloudy chilled Sake to take the edge off the salt of soy sauce.  

Overall not terrible, not great.  Probably wouldn't return.  I'd recommend Sumo Maya as a fantastic albeit slightly more expensive alternative."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with pleasant and attentive staff.  We weren't impressed with the food. Kimchi and eggplant appetizer was too fishy and salty. The eggplant was ok for a few bites and then too salty.  The pepper appetizer was the best dish we tried. 

For entree had the veggie ramen. Great portion but it lacked anything special, especially at $15.  That as well was too salty.  Overall wasn't impressed, disappointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"YUM!!! Excellent food, great service. I can't say enough about the Ramon bowls. The $14 \"martinis\" on the other hand....."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The atmosphere is classy and the food is not bad but definitely not worth the price. Raman bowls are around 15-19 dollars and the sashimi plate I ordered as an appetizer was $17. 

The service was prompt, friendly, and personable on the Wednesday afternoon that I was here so no complaints there. 

Overall - not bad food but not great food and out of my price range for a regular meal."}
{"text":"We were there with a small group. 
Nice friendly staff. 
Ordered the fried calamari salad and it was delicious. Very fresh too."}
{"text":"We decided to visit since I had a craving for ramen and I had seen this place had just opened.  After reading the ravings of everyone I had it fresh in my mind. The first thing we noticed upon entering and looking over the menu was how fun and creative it was. The Hentai Old Fashioned was delicious and super fun and my daughter enjoyed the Japanese soda.
We tried a little bit of everything: gyoza, sushi, soft shelled crab buns, street noodles and ramen and it was all delicious.The prices were a bit high but it looks like they have a decent happy hour where certain items are lower in price. We'll probably try to come back during this time in the future.
If this restaurant does as well as I hope they will (with their fun and delicious menu) we will be happy to return."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  Interesting!  Ambiance!  Sake!  Fresh fresh fresh!!! The ginger and wasabi ....yum!  This is my new sushi go to place in Scottsdale I am looking forward to my next visit so I can try something else on the menu. I promise, you will  it!  Omg...I went back with my big. We had the seared walu!!!  Yum yum!  Can't stop thinking about it!  So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolute garbage.... the sushi sucks, service is worse, and the bathrooms were filthy.  There are plenty of places I would recommend over OBON, especially in Tempe!!!"}
{"text":"I thought the location location was good and I enjoyed the small but intimate patio. My server \"Ross\" did an excellent job and was on top of whatever I needed.

I had a house salad; great combination of greens. The salad itself is good but requires a request of extra dressing for me. In addition, I had the Pork Goyza and the two together were an ample meal.

They have two bar areas inside to enjoy your meal at as well and the establishment is first class from a decor aspect.

I would give it 4 stars but I take issue with the menu pricing; it is just noodles and rice in reality. I dine at many sushi bars and pay attention to pricing.

Overall, I had a great experience and would recommend this place to others visiting the Scottsdale Quarter. However, this is not a destination for me.  However, I will invibe if I am in the area.

{"text":"The sushi was ok, Definitely not worth the price and the experience was the worst. They have terrible customer service and you'll wait HOURS for your food. 
Take your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Decent food.

We ordered the:

1. Tonkotsu Ramen (3.0 stars).  $15.  Broth was good however it came out lukewarm.  Who serves Tonkotsu lukewarm? Pork belly slice was minimal.  Pork shoulder, which was plentiful, was not a good meat to put in this soup.  It doesn't have a good taste.

2. Veggie Ramen $15.  She liked it.

3. Monster Roll (soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, and spicy tuna roll) - 2.5 stars. so so.  The soft shell crab was tiny.  I could not taste any meat.  Just batter and some shell.  Taste was decent.  I expected better quality for a $15 roll.

Prices high but food quality does not match up."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for dinner on a Saturday night at about 7pm and we did not have a reservation but there were two spots open at the bar which was perfect since it was still the full menu. As we were looking at the drink menu deciding what to have my boyfriend was trying to decide between two different specialty cocktails, the Korean Cooler or the New Growth. The bartender Brandon gave us a sample of the Korean Cooler and we loved that so my boyfriend got that and I got the Coconut Thyme. We LOVED the cocktails. Brandon was an AWESOME bartender! 

For dinner I decided on the Bird Steamed Bun and the Vegetarian Ramen with an egg and it was OUTSTANDING!!! The Bird Steamed Bun was just perfectly cooked and so flavorful. I'm already craving it again! The ramen was so tasty and you get a ton of noodles. One of the best I've ever had and I will certainly get that again. My boyfriend had the Monster Roll and also loved it. It was so pretty and perfectly filling. He also had some of my ramen as there was so much to eat.

I truly cannot wait to go back for another Coconut Thyme cocktail and get the Steamed Bun and I will try some of their other options. Every food that came out around us looked wonderful so I highly doubt you can go wrong with any choice.

Service was awesome by Brandon and we will now sit at the bar every time we head back!"}
{"text":"Great location. Decently busy. Good service. We don't have much in this corner of the world. If you know your food then don't expect anything quality. If you know real sushi and ramen then close your eyes and have a few beers, enjoy the scenery.

If your from outta town, save yourself time and just go to ROKA Akor."}
{"text":"It's like eating the more expensive 2.00$ bags of ramen instead of the cheap top ramen. Not worth it.

Staff is friendly though"}
{"text":"The ramen was delicious. Not like Top Ramen at all...and I've eaten a lot of Top Ramen.  #tylerlied"}
{"text":"The ramen were pretty good here but the kimchi fried rice was a bit on the salty side. They hv a very nice decor as well.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Wow! My husband and I had one of THE most amazing meals.  We weren't huge fans of the ramen (we are ramen snobs) but every other bite was literally so incredible that It doesn't even matter.  We tried a little something from each menu and highly recommend the following: spam steam bun (I promise you will dig it!), tataki Maki roll, jalapeño albacore crudo & hamachi Serrano nigiri.  ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Nope. Nope. Nope. While the food may be good, the service definitely isn't. Also, Brandon, cmon man. Insulting your reviewers in a public forum just makes you look bad and your business look worse. We had an issue with a few things and tried to talk to the manager? Owner? I dunno. Whoever 'Brandon' basically ignored us. I came here to leave a review and found even more disparaging comments from the 'owner' to other Yelp reviewers. It made my experience even more sour. No food is worth being treated that way. Save your money. Go somewhere that values you."}
{"text":"Ok so 2 stars only. The food was great but the service needs work. The girl who sits people is who I had a problem with. I walked in behind a guy so I waited there for her to come back. In the mean time 2 guys walked in behind me. She seated them first....ok so I'll let that go. Waited again. A group of 3 girls came in behind me. And again she was going to skip me....But the girls were no she was here first. The girl turns and say ooo, really ooo I know u saw me!!!!!! She didn't even apologize... I hope management trains their people better. That experience with her left me so upset for the rest of the lunch."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this restaurant! The decor was really cool. I came with a group of 6 tonight with no reservation at like 7:30 and we were super lucky to get a table pretty quickly. The group that came after us would've had an hour wait! 
There are some awesome options on the menu. Poke, noodle bowls, sushi, and ramen! I got the veggie ramen and also shared the veggie sushi roll. Our service was pretty slow, took her a while to take our order, we spent most of dinner with our waters empty. This was made up for with seriously awesome food though! My ramen was absolutely delicious, I got the spice on the side and added a little, it was just right. Some people said their noodles lacked flavor, but mine soaked up the miso broth well, very tasty. The sushi roll wasn't the best I've ever had, some of the avocado looked a bit brown, but otherwise good. Everyone else liked their food too! My boyfriend and his friends tried spam bao and loved it. My sister and her friend really liked their street noodles too! A bit of a splurge to come here, but it's worth it for delightful ramen!"}
{"text":"For some time now Scottsdale Quarter has been sans a sushi place after the exit of the one that held a place of honor. 
Lo and behold! We now have Obon that took over the place vacated by a restaurant that was a sorry excuse for an eatery. 
I had to check this place out and am I glad I did with my daughter, son-in/law and their 2 year old and 6 year old. 
Mon Dieu!
This place could possibly lay claim to the title of The Temple of Japanese Food. 
The place is very well organized, the service is superb and very accommodating. 
But forget that! The food is outstanding! The fish is fresh and each and every roll we tried was delicious. 
The sashimi was so good that we had to place a second order of the salmon sashimi for my six year old granddaughter. 
I was also impressed by the presentation of the food. Very creative. 
Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but my noodle bowl tasted burnt. My husband wasn't a fan of his either. Portion size is good. Menu is quite pricey. There is outdoor seating but it's very small."}
{"text":"Pumped I got to try Obon Sushi Bar Ramen after watching it be built the last month or so. The décor is sexy and sophisticated and really stands out from the other more casual restaurants in the Quarter. Jay was our server and she was delightful! I asked for a cocktail recommendation and ended up ordering the Coconut Thyme {blended rum | coconut milk | thyme jellies} and while not what I would normally order, it was pretty good. The thyme jellies are exactly what they sound like and were an interesting touch. The rest of the drink menu looked eclectic and I am looking forward to returning and trying a few others in the near future. 
To start I ordered Hamachi nigiri and a pork belly steamed bun. The nigiri was fine, nothing to write home about. The pork bun was fabulous, cooked perfectly and melt in your mouth good. For my entrée I went with the Tonkatsu Ramen. The portion was kind of small and there wasn't a ton of broth but what it lacked in volume it made up for in flavor. I normally like my ramen a little richer but this broth was intensely flavorful and satisfying. I would definitely order it again.  Next time I'm in I will absolutely try some of their many crudos and signature rolls. For a new restaurant the food and service was on point, and I'm sure it will only get better."}
{"text":"On my last night in the Phoenix area, I decided to check out OBON and boy am I glad I did! 

I ordered the pork steamed bun and the salmon poke bowl for dinner.

The pork bun could have been warmer but it was very good. The pork was nicely marinated and the the pickled cucumbers gave it a nice crunch and refreshing taste with the pork. The bun was very soft and plush.

However the salmon poke was a very special surprise for my tastebuds. Though not huge, it had a generous amount of salmon. The jalepenos gave it a nice kick and the greens and radish were seasoned perfectly. What made this dish really delicious were these little bits of crunchy amazing ness on top of the rice at the bottom of the bowl. I'm not quite sure exactly what they were but the texture was perfect with this bowl.

It was filling and didn't leave room for sushi or ramen so I will certainly be back next time I'm in town! 

The service was also very good."}
{"text":"Since I liked their ramen at their Tucson location, I was really excited for their grand opening in north Scottsdale location just about a month ago.

Since their kitchen wasn't too busy when we arrived early for lunch, chef agreed to split the bowl and we each had own small bowl of Obon ramen. Their 64 degree egg is soft but no flavor, I would have preferred aji tama for ramen but egg was cooked perfectly soft. Broth was the same as what I remembered from their Tucson location, pretty good.

Tried pork buns and their soft bread is really soft and tasty, great appetizer to try.

Shared some sushi, I liked monster roll, lots of flavor. Shiro maki tasted like just standard spicy something rolls, it didn't worth for extra price for what it is.

Overall a bit pricy for what they offer, smaller volume. I guess it is something to do with their location.

Liked their decor and service was excellent. It's not a special occasion place nor everyday lunch place. Somewhere in between... conveniently located within Scottsdale Quarter, I will keep in mind of this place when I crave for ramen next time."}
{"text":"Obon is my favorite ramen-sushi blend in Scottsdale. The staff is friendly and they treat us like family every time we come in. 

The ramen is to-die-for! I usually get the Tonkatsu ramen and I have to say, I never thought I would want to eat ramen again after my dorm room days.  I think it's so good because chef is 100% koren so he knows what he's doing. 

When I'm feeling extra hungry, I order the pork belly steam bun- it's straight FIRE  

I love Obon sushi!!!"}
{"text":"Was very anxious to try this place as it took quite some time for them to open after making the announcement that they were coming. It was a bit disappointing though. 

High points would be that the atmosphere was pretty cool and the staff was very nice. Also the flavor of the food was quite good. But nothing made me say wow I can't wait to come back. Also, it was expensive for what you get. My ramen bowl had a total of three pieces of pork in it. The noodles and the broth were good but basically it was a very expensive bowl of soup. 

Also the drinks were so small. I thought I was being punked when they were being served to us. The margarita glass was a tiny goblet that was smaller in diameter than the soy sauce dish that accompanies the chopsticks. The tiny orange that was floating in it as a garnish was the size of a nickel. The manager was very nice about it and first suggested that the volume of fluid in the glass was similar to that of a regular martini glass which was kind of laughable. He offered to give us another round for free but that wasn't really the point. They are going to have a very difficult time surviving in this market if they serve margaritas the size of shot glasses for $12. Also, others in my party felt like the menu was confusing and they didn't know what they were ordering. I understand this place does very well in Tucson but they're going to have to step up their game if they want to make it in Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"After trying all of the ramen places in the Phoenix area, I had to try this place as well, and it was AMAZING. Because I usually base the ramen quality of a restaurant on the Tonkostsu ramen, I had a hard time deciding between the Tonkotsu and the Tsukemen ramen. Instead, I decided to have my friend order the Tonkotsu so I can taste the broth, and I would order the Tsukemen ramen. I have tried the Tsukemen ramen in LA and in Japan so I definitely had to try the only place in Phoenix and the surrounding area that served Tsukemen ramen.

For those that don't know, the Tsukemen ramen comes with separate broth in another bowl and you would dip the ramen noodles in the broth instead of having the broth and noodles in the same bowl. The broth was similar to a sweet thick soy sauce with sesame oil and topped with lots of sesame seeds and green onions. It was delicious! The texture of the broth and the oil really coated the ramen well and ensured a lot of flavor with each bite. In addition, there was this crunch to it from the sesame seeds. The prosciutto that came with the ramen was also very tasty, and it was refreshing to see a prosciutto used in this way.

Next time, I'll have to try the Tonkotsu ramen fully. Being the only place as of right now to serve Tsukemen ramen and doing a great job at it, I will have to give this place a 5 star. For a different variety in your ramen diet, OBON sushi won't disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Second time back and we really enjoyed it. We ordered nigiri and ramen, both were excellent. We will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I generally don't write rough reviews but sadly this place disappointed more than expected.  Obon seems to leverage the fact that it shares real estate with the fancy boutique stores at Scottsdale Quarter, and prices things abnormally high for what you get.  Execution and service was sadly not there, the only thing that could have saved it.

The place was not busy at all, even though the restaurant looked the part, the food and service didn't deliver.  The over prices ramen bowls arrived at the same time as our Sashimi plate ordered as an appetizer.  So we were figuring out what to eat first, let the ramen cool off? Or let the fish go warm.  Yikes.

The major fail:  For a place who dares to serve sushi and sashimi, that was possibly the roughest looking fish I have seen on that side of town.  The sashimi (all pieces) did not hold its form, the cuts were small, but most importantly the quality of the fish was not there.  It was sticky, dull, not shiny, and limp.  There was no care or even thought put on this plate of sad fish.

The ramen from what we could tell was decent, though, not deserving of its price point.  Don't waste your time, this place will not impress and there are plenty of spots where you could drop $60 on lunch between two people and walk away satisfied.

Sorry Obon, step it up.  You're in Scottsdale Quarter, you have to show you can mess with the big boys down there."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! I got the Tonkotsu Ramen and added the spice bomb (highly recommended if you like spicy!). The egg was perfectly cooked and the broth was well seasoned. Great dinner experience!"}
{"text":"Really good food and service. The patio is lovely. We had poke bowls that were amazing and although they didn't have a kids menu, they made my girls a really nice soup that they loved. I recommend."}
{"text":"This place has quite the eclectic menu with selections of sushi, some bibimbap and ramen.  Ordered the bibimbap, couple of rolls and some appetizers.  Waited and waited.  Server kept saying don't worry we serve as it's made and it's coming right out.  Sat there 60 mins and server said the same thing.  This time I said good because we are about to leave.  Then the server came over and said oh there was a problem with your order they are working on it right now.  The assistant manager will come by and discuss it.

The assistant manager came by and said \"sorry for the delay\" and promptly dropped the food at our table.  You'd thing after being hungry for 90 mins anything would taste good.  Some did but the bibimbap was a bit of a disappointment and none of the dishes were good enough to make me suffer that kind of service again."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi in the Scottsdale quarter.  One the signature drinks, the Machi, was definitely not to my taste.  I had to refuse the drink and I RARELY do that.  It tasted like a bandaid and the aftertaste lingered and lingered.  Of course they were happy to replace it with a well made Old Fashioned.  Sushi was great.  We ordered the Monster and the Shiro Maki.  Both were excellent.  Of the two I'd say the Monster was more unique and tasty, it included soft shell crab which I had never had before and was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Stopped in to OBON for lunch after a hair appointment at DryBar. I was excited to see a Vegan Ramen option. I got the Veggie Ramen and unfortunately was not thrilled.  $15 for a bowl of flavorless broth and noodles. There were scallions and bean sprouts but would have like more substance out of a $15 soup. The seating on the patio was wonderful and relaxing. If you are going to stop in sit outside. 
Thank you for offering a vegan option."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend last night. I ordered Miso Soup, Salmon Crudo,  Waluu Tataki and Sea Bass sashimi. My friend ordered a Calamari Salad. I will say that the food, when they got it right, was good. The fish was fresh and well prepared. I'm only giving this restaurant 2 stars because our server was truly awful! I wish I remembered her name, but I'll say she had really long, dark hair and a rude, condescending disposition. It was very quiet there last night, for such a busy location, but I'm guessing the poor service might have something to do with that. 

Our server started off by seeming irritated that we needed a little time to order. It wasn't crowded, so it's not like we were keeping her from turning the table. When the Waluu Tataki was served, it came with an ahi tuna salad. We were confused because we hadn't ordered that salad and the plate with the Waluu had 2 kinds of fish on it. Our server was visibly annoyed WITH US when we explained my friend plainly ordered the Calamari salad. I was confused by the Waluu plate, but she just kept saying \"that's how it comes\" and even asked me if I \"changed my mind about that too.\" I never changed my mind about anything on my order, but I was confused, thinking i hadn't read the description properly. Turns out it was Sea Bass nigiri, which I hadn't ordered at all. Annoyed server returns with correct salad and we continue our meal. About 20 minutes later I ask about my Sea Bass sashimi. She argues with me that I ordered nigiri, not sashimi. I said no, I know what I ordered. I ask to see sushi order sheet that I filled out and she said she threw it away. I call BS. I eat at sushi restaurants at least 3-4 times a month. They always keep these, often attaching to check. She brought me the sashimi, but it came with a ridiculous amount of attitude!  No apology, no thanks for dining, no offer of desert menu, nothing. I thought about asking for manager but, honestly, I didn't want more of my night with my friend tainted by bad experience. I'm really bummed because the food was good, but I'm not willing to patronize restaurants with rude servers."}
{"text":"Everything we had at dinner yesterday was very tasty! Our server Tiara was very attentive and made some great suggestions. The veg steamed bun was really good."}
{"text":"Tried OBON for lunch for the first time today and was really impressed. We tried a bunch of different things but the Spicy Shrimp and the Ramen were definitely my favorite things we ate. The Steamed Buns were tasty, but the Crab was too salty, the Spam had too much sauce and the buns were soggy. The actual noodles in the ramen were a great texture and the soup had depth without being to salty. Also the vegetarian ramen is vegan with eggless noodles! The sushi was good, but it wasn't amazing honestly. Overall a good dining experience. We had a really great waitress as well. She forgot to put on our Steamed Bun order and went ahead and took them off our bill after we reminded her about them! Definitely a good place to stop if you want ramen!"}
{"text":"Great experience dining here! Love the classic flavors and unique twists on favorites. The modern Nigiri is especially good. The cocktails are amazing. The service was attentive and the atmosphere was fun and inviting."}
{"text":"OBON is the newest addition to the Scottsdale Quarter, located where TKs Urban used to be.
If you enjoy Korean or Japanese influenced cuisine, then you'll surely love this spot.
The ramen with pork belly is phenomenal... The sushi is beautiful. Don't come in seeking wasabi, soy sauce, etc... this is sushi done right, without needing a bunch of sauce or nonsense to hide the true quality of the fish.
ALSO BEST DESSERT YOU'LL EVER HAVE! Ask for it... there's only one, but it's all they need.

The cocktail program is innovative. I myself LOVE Scotch... so their dark liquor drinks are my go-tos. But there is something for everyone, whether you want wine, beer, sake, etc and the prices are excellent for the quality you get. Lagavullin 16 for under 25 wink wink.

Excellent staff... my bartender, Sarah, made a killer drink; My server, Vivian, was nothing short of perfect. The management staff and ownership group know what they're doing. Taylor (the manager) did a \"table touch\" and chatted for a few. She's very professional and they should feel blessed to have such a young, yet restaurant savvy lady on their team. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, yet simple. It's a nice break from the steakhouse / Sam Fox norm of Scottsdale.

Nicely done, Obon.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Some innovative, interesting and delicious menu items, although one wouldn't call it authentic.  Street noodles where quite good with perfect level of spice. We enjoyed the crab and the chicken buns. Hamachi crudo was delicious.  The house sushi rolls got too much going on for me. The essence of sushi for me is simplicity, although many diners seem to like these complex multi-ingredient rolls. Modern setting at Scottsdale Quarter, lively, cool music."}
{"text":"We traveled to Scottsdale on Business and found OBON Sushi Ramen for the Ramen Noodle late at night. Being a Chef and former restaurant owners in the Bay Area, we know our Asian food, and WOW was it good!!

The Food: Ramen was super fresh and cooked to perfection, definitely Five stars. We ordered the Crab steamed bun as an appetizer, perfect crispy crab on a fresh steam bun with some great sauces inside, excellent. Ordered (1) Sushi roll (sorry forgot the name) again fresh and flavorful. 

The Staff: Our Waitress was delightful and helped us through the favorites on the menu.

The Atmosphere: We had a nice table in the outdoor seating area, good music, lots of laughter, a view of some of the Scottsdale shops.

Highly recommend this place, be warned you might get addicted!! 

Ramen was even better than the Bay Area, which is hard to beat... 5+++ Stars or more

Bon Appetit!!!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend. We decided to give it a try. The OBON Ramen was great. We had rolls and sushi and everything was good. It is however a little pricey. I guess considering the location it is right there with others."}
{"text":"Three of us dined.  We all ordered different and shared.  Excellent food!  Poke bowls are excellent.  Street noodles were terrific.  The best is the Ramen!  We enjoyed our experience not just because the food was good, we also had awesome service (Jessica).  Wish the bar was a bit bigger.  IT would be nice to sit somewhere when waiting for a table.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi restaurant at Scottsdale Quarter!  Quite busy all the time too which is a good sign. 

For lunch my friend and I split a sushi roll to start, \"The Strip\". It was delicious! Combination warm, cold and crispy. Probably one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had. 

For lunch I had the Obon ramen. Huge bowl of noodle and pork goodness!  Great flavor and again, a very generous portion!  Only thing I would skip is the \"spice bomb\" which is a small up charge.  I like to add spice to my ramen, but this was just spicy but no chili flavor.

Can't wait to go back for that roll and ramen!  Be sure to check this place out when at Scottsdale
Quarter! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi I've eaten! The chef made us a few things specially because my wife was pregnant. In hindsight I wish I had some pictures to share but the sushi was so good it didn't last long enough to capture. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Service: We didn't receive waters and another place setting for 10 mins after we sat down. After alerting a nearby waitress, the manager, Tony, came out and apologized and check up on us twice more during the meal! After a terrible first impression, Obon more than made up for the service.

Food: We got the Obon and Tonkatsu ramens and they were a good size and very delicious! I also got the thyme drink (had coconut in it but forgot the name) as well as the Korean cooler. We didn't like the drinks, but Tony took them off the menu.

Very good food, drinks were meh but excellent service after a rocky start. Would recommend especially for date night."}
{"text":"I am knocking a star for the over priced food. It is good, but nothing special. Most things can be made non spicy"}
{"text":"excellent service and very good food, ordered escolar appetizer ($9-) and got two small pieces of sushi but it was very tasty. Gyozas were eight pieces and excellent. We both ordered ramen bowls with pork and
they were very large and tasted very well, we were unable to finish them.
I recommend but suggest you be selective in ordering appetizers, avoid the sushi due to size of portions."}
{"text":"I've been in a little bit of a ramen craze of late ever since I've been reintroduced to it by someone I follow on YouTube. I've tried two or three ramen dishes at Obon and I'm a huge fan of the Tonkatsu. Eating it is definitely more than just trying to satisfy my hunger. From slowly sipping the soup to eating the pork and noodles; it's definitely an experience. The broth tastes likely something they took their time to make earlier that morning or more likely over night. It feels like comfort food without being overindulgent. As an appetizer, I've also tried their buns, crispy shrimp, and crispy calamari. The crispy calamari is the one I would highly recommend to you. It's a very generous helping and works well for a warm day. They have quite a selection to choose from and I know I'm going to find it very difficult trying something new when I'm there, but I can easily see that I'll coming back again and again."}
{"text":"This was difficult to review .......the service very good . Compared to the sushi/Ramon / Poke in the Scottsdale area .....except service it didn't compare with sushi \" the roll was very loose and you couldn't pick it up with chopsticks\" the ramen came out last and was under cooked and very small compared to their competition Poke was very small and had no flavor .....just hot ....pork bun was ok ....but we ordered 1 and we really needed 2 pc cause they are small ....nothing had outstanding flavor which I would expect from the size .....maybe because it's new ......and the order in which the food comes out is really poor.....everything comes out backwards ( the waitress did tell us )"}
{"text":"Been looking for a ramen place which has been hard to find in the Scottsdale area. Here, it was fairly decent, but overpriced. But I suppose given their location I can understand why. 
My husband got the bimbimbap which he thought was also overpriced especially for the one small piece of meat it came with.
Will be back when I get the craving but not very frequently given the cost."}
{"text":"I wanted to forget about my birthday dinner experience at Obon, but this somehow came up on Yelp, and I was unfortunately reminded of how I'm never coming back to this place.

I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen and the Tataki Maki roll. 
Both were seriously just meh. 
Nothing stood out from either. The broth wasn't great, the pork wasn't great, the sushi roll just had a lot of stuff on it, but no particular flavors stood out. But they were both very expensive, and nothing can justify why it costs so much, besides it being in Scottsdale, but that's not worth it.

I asked for something spicy for my broth, and I got this little spoon of what I think was sriracha, or the similar, laid on top of some cole slaw. Useless presentation. And did I mention how little this spoon of chili was?!?! Smaller than the tip of my pinky!! No joke. I hope they stopped doing that and just bring out a realistic amount of chili that is actually spicy. Oh, and they also charged me 50 cents for that small dab of chili laying on top of some coleslaw. 

It is in Scottsdale, so if you want to grab some drinks or just hang out with friends, it's fine. If you are thinking of going for the ramen, mmmm I'd think a few more times."}
{"text":"While at the Scottsdale Quarter Mall, we headed into OBON for an early dinner.  OBON is known for it's ramen, sushi, and Japanese dishes with Korean influences.  In addition to inside seating, there is a small bar area inside and an outdoor patio area.  Style is nice, but casual.  There are happy hour discounts on selected items if you're there early enough.  Even Saturday.  Food was great and the wait staff was quite knowledgeable and helpful."}
{"text":"Obon is an upscale Japanese restaurant featuring sushi, ramen, and other small and large bites. I have little experience with ramen (other than the stuff that comes in plastic bags that got me through college).  With that in mind, here's my review.

My wife ordered off the sushi menu.  She found the fish to be fresh but did not care for the Wasabi.  She also didn't love the trim on the salmon as they left the layer between the skin and the flesh on the sushi.  I tried the tuna and the halibut and they were both fresh and nicely cut.

I ordered the crab steamed buns and the Obon Ramen.  The buns were OK but I thought the crab was over-fried and a bit too salty.  This would have  been a much better dish with sauteed soft shelled crabs.  The ramen, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious.  As I noted, I don't have any experience with Ramen but the flavors were rich and complex.  The pork melted in my mouth and was not overseasoned.  The noodles were, well, noodles. I loved them.  

Service was excellent. Vivian was a great waitress with good suggestions and an engaging personality.  When I return, I'll probably try try the pork buns and a different ramen.  

The atmosphere is what I term 'busy modern'.  It's a little noisy but did not interfere with conversation.  Decor is a little nondescript but certainly pleasant.  

Overall, it's a nice place for dinner and the prices are not unreasonably, especially for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love e this place!   I love the staff!  I love the food!!   I like be the vegetarian ramen!   Great music and ambiance!  Their food is great to go as well!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to OBON for dinner on a Saturday night. It was busy but we had a reservation so we were seated right away.

Our server was very friendly and walked us through the menu options since it was our first time in. She answered all of our questions and let us take our time to decide.

We wanted to share so we could try more things so we ordered the salmon nigiri, the strip roll, obon ramen and 3 steamed buns.

Pretty much all the food came out at the same time which wasn't totally ideal but we rolled with it and accepted the feast set in front of us. We figured the ramen would stay warm the longest so we dug into the other dishes first.

The nigiri and roll were both very good. The salmon had a crispy onion on top that added a really nice flavor and crunch. The roll was a good size to share and tasty as well.

For the steamed buns we chose spam, bird(chicken) and pork. All of them were a little spicy but I think the spam was the spiciest. I liked the pork best, husband preferred the spam and we both liked the bird.

When we got to the ramen our server was very nice and brought us an extra bowl and a ladle so it was easier to share. It was a large portion so I'm glad we shared. Tons of noodles, plenty of pork and the broth had a good flavor to it. The egg was maybe a little overcooked but that may be because we let it sit for a bit while we ate our other food.

Overall we really enjoyed our dinner and we would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We tried this place recently and the food was delicious. We had never been to a ramen place before (haha who eats ramen after college) but we decided since ramen is the new \"it\" food to give it a try. It was totally worth it! The most memorable thing in the ramen was the soft boiled egg, oh my it was delicious. The flavors are amazing and we will definitely be back. We are glad to have stopped in. 

A tip, one ramen feeds two adults. We didn't know that, and ended up with plenty of leftovers. And that was ok!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! The food was incredible! And the fresh wasabi! What!!!! 

Great service! Great owner! Just a great spot! 

A must come back! Like tomorrow lol."}
{"text":"This is hands down the most AMAZING food/poke I have ever had. The ramen is to die for, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I HIGHLY recommend this place! Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast service, I will differently come back. The poke salmon is awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing New RAMEN restaurant in north Scottsdale! I was referred by a friend who's been here 2 times since they opened 2 weeks ago. I LOVED it. My last memorable Ramen experience was in Hawaii years ago.. This is comparable. Cocktails are fantastic. Ramen is even better. I def recommend trying their steamed buns. So so delish! The setting/atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. And 5 star service. Everyone is friendly and attentive. It's a little pricey but worth it for the experience. I will be back to try the sushi and other ramen dishes."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great ramen and bibimbap plus their craft cocktails are amazing!"}
{"text":"The service here was okay on a Saturday afternoon, we opted to sit outside and had our drink orders taken by two different servers. Disappointed in the lack of beer selection, I believe they only have two draft beers available. I liked my wings, the fiancee really liked the Bun that she ordered. Sushi was pretty good, but not spectacular. I ordered a roll (forgot the name) and it had a lot of really nice components but the roll was too big to really eat like a normal sushi roll and it had a kind of unpleasant fishy taste to it. Not sure we would go back, if we did, it may just be for a quick appetizer."}
{"text":"I stopped here one weekend while shopping in Scottsdale with my friend. The air reds was friendly and recommended different dishes to us since it was out first time. I decided to go with the Obon Ramen and it was amazing! I can't wait to come back here again"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had... I have to tell 'RA' \"I think we should see other people\"   We ordered 4 different dishes and all four were amazing."}
{"text":"Lovely spot. Great food and service. Manager stopped by to chat with us as well. Only thing I can say is I know they are still brand new but i hope their hostesses and their them get better with open table. I have worked with open table for the 3 and half years and its an easy system if done right. Also I hope the Scottsdale Quarters employee get a discount in the future!"}
{"text":"alright, i'm on vacation in arizona and you already know i am a sushi fanatic. this place is remarkable. everything on the menu is very unique and unlike any other sushi restaurant i've ever been to, in the best ways! also the chef/creator of the menu/literal founder of the restaurant (i forgot his name sorry) IS SO NICE! along with all of the other employees. the service was great, the food was phenomenal. this place inspired me to download this app. I'M HERE TO HYPE THIS UP, THIS IS NOT A GAME. COME HERE. THANKS."}
{"text":"Yum - well worth the wait Food is amazing people are super nice location is awesome. Great price point drinks are good nice place to stop after shopping"}
{"text":"The first place I ever had Ramen was in LA and it was in essence the highest rated places in LA so I kind of figured the standard would be a bit high. Either way I came with an open mind. 

The venue is nice and the staff is nice, this is purely food based review.

We came to try some Ramen. We ordered the Obon and Tonkotsu. Of the two I think the Tonkotsu was better. It had more of that \"ramen\" taste that we wanted. I thought the pork belly was good and the shoulder was new to me and pretty good.

The reason it just came out a-ok was really the broth. It doesn't have that same deep Ramen flavor. It's not as savory and rich, this also had a more \"chicken\" based flavor to me. The noodles were also pretty forgettable. I can't say the bamboo shoots did much for me either.

It wasn't bad but it just didn't really hit the mark for me. I would say if you've never had Ramen before - keep searching.

I have no opinion on any other food or drink they serve, hopefully they are better."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The atmosphere was fantastic inside and outside. Our waiter, Ross, was fantastic and his recommendations were on point. The cold sake infused with clove was amazing and I don't even like sake! The crudos are so good. The Yuzo Yellowtail was very tasty!"}
{"text":"I hope this restaurant make it after 1st year. Sushi not that great/Good. No fresh wasabi,but tried to make a fresh one with powder paste wasabi. No go for Sushi. Will try   ramen on the next visit. ."}
{"text":"I love the ramen. It is so good!!!! The sushi is pretty fresh. I have been here a few times and it has been wonderful and delicious each time. It is my favorite ramen place!"}
{"text":"This was some of the best Ramen I've had! Just a tad overpriced for one roll of sushi, averaging around $18, but very delicious. Waited quite a while for our food to be served. Definitely go here if you have time on your hands, not if you're in a rush! Experience was overall great and atmosphere was very inviting and nice."}
{"text":"Food was good  but overpriced and the service was terrible. We ordered drinks then later ordered appetizers, the drinks didn't come until one of the two entrees arrived. Yes one of two they brought the entrees out almost 5 minutes apart. The wait to order and the wait for food to arrive was also way to long. Definitely would not recommend and definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is great. Highly recommend it. Food is great. The menu is really diverse. Location is great as well."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to have a drink, first of all. If you're craft-cocktail-inclined, then I recommend this place purely for the imbibery. There are a lot of interesting things to choose from.

As for food-side of things, I recommend the shoyu ramen and bird buns in particular. You also can't go wrong with any of the sushi rolls. You may think the prices are a little high, but you're getting high-quality ingredients and well-made food, which makes it hard to complain."}
{"text":"OBON on THIS Saturday afternoon was dead as was the service. It took forever to get the papaya salad which didn't resemble papaya and was too spicy- there was no up charge for the insect in it. We were told we wouldn't be charged for it and we were. As for the rest of the meal...Yellowtail crudo was acceptable, pork gyoza yummy, and the steamed buns acceptable; nothing great. It was the horrible service that took me from 3 to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Meh is about right.  I had high hopes for this place, right in the sweet spot at the Quarter.  The service was extremely slow, the food  was ok but extremely overpriced.  My ramen had 3 tiny pieces of meat, the rest was filler.  They are really very stingy at the bar-- expensive cocktails come in tiny glasses.  We also had a glass of wine that was extremely warm and when I asked if I could get the pinot noir at the proper temperature they looked at me like I was nuts.  Bottom line, you can't charge $16 for a glass of pinot noir and service it at room temperature in scottsdale, AZ.  58 degrees people...

In the end, like everything else thats corporate, its not worth it.  Pure Sushi up the road is soooo much better- plus its locally owned."}
{"text":"The food and staff here are amazing. We come here a few times a month. The edamame is among my favorite ever."}
{"text":"What a neat place!  A great mix of Asian food and culture!  We had some sushi, some kimchi, some Ramen noodles and steamed buns.  It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"I stopped here with my mother for a quick bite - the patio seating is very comfortable and elegant and the food came very quickly. I ordered a papaya salad and this is one of the only places in Scottsdale/Phoenix which does their papaya salad the correct way (with nampa)! The food was amazing, service was amazing, and drinks were amazing! The salad is definitely app size though and was $8, but given the quality I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It was date night so I decided to Yelp a cool and different place to eat from our norm. Found OBON Sushi Bar Ramen. We made reservations and we were seated right away. Restaurant was not to busy but we did have early reservations prior to our movie at iPic and we scored happy hour prices. Our server, forgot her name was AWESOME, extremely nice, personable and was always making sure we were good.

We started with the Obon Edamame, which sadly we had to send back because they were over sauced. No big deal, they just replaced it with regular edamame.

Wife ordered the Poke with greens, it was fine. She was looking to eat a healthy meal but in comparison to other Poke spots around town, it lacked a lot of key ingredients that makes Poke so special.

We shared the Obon Ramen and holy hell that bowl of ramen is freaking good. That bowl of ramen is what dreams are made of.

As far as sushi goes, we ordered the Tataki Maki and it too was freaking amazing. The twist of the ingredients made it an unique signature roll, the thinly sliced tomato, who would have thought, would give it such a kick. Bravo to the chef who put that bad boy together. 

If you're looking for something different, and even though it's hot as heck outside, TRY THEIR RAMEN!!! It's amazing!!"}
{"text":"Really great authentic Asian food. Lots of yummy choices and the ramen bowls were so delish! Great service too! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Located in a quaint/hipster part of Scottsdale, everything we consumed was awesome!!! Our waitress was exceedingly friendly, helpful, knowledgeable about all the dishes and made some great recommendations. 
We started with the pork, crab and jack fruit buns. Off the hook. We then had the Obon ramen and a sushi roll. Can't remember the name of the roll. The only complaint we had was not enough of either. We couldn't eat another bite if we wanted. Full as ticks!! The price was very reasonable. With 2 drinks each, less than $80."}
{"text":"We've been to OBON a few times now and have never been disappointed. Service is top notch and food is delicious! We've brought some friends from out of town here and they loved it too. This is our go to sushi and ramen spot!"}
{"text":"Best Gozya ever! Arrived in time for happy hour to enjoy cocktails and Gozya & papaya salad.Excellent moved to a table & tried the Yusuf yellow tail which was great. Two of us had the Bimbimbop Korean beef dish which was full of flavor and two had the OBON ramen, which I tasted and had a delicious broth. We were well satisfied with our meals and the service was good. All in all totally enjoyed experience."}
{"text":"Nice place for ramen. I like the variety of ramen on the menu. I ordered the Obon Ramen, and it was definitely delicious and different. 

Glad we got to stop here for ramen tonight, just perfect. Ramen and beer, good pairing."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot - their Tonkatsu Ramen was very tasty and in my experience it's difficult to get good ramen in Arizona. They offer to bring out a side of their homemade hot sauce to put into the ramen which is called Spice Bomb - but it's sooooo hot! I just tasted it with my chopsticks and it burned away those taste buds. Our waitress said it's very popular though so who knows - maybe mixed in it isn't so hot?
I like the location at Scottsdale Quarter right across from Dominick's and H&M. The inside decor is nice and relaxing. 
The only thing I didn't like was I sat at the few tables that backed up against the people sitting at the bar. So while the bar seats were high, our tables were low so I was back to back with someone sitting at the bar - but much lower because I was at a regular heigh table. But anywhere else in the restaurant wouldn't have that problem. I will request to sit somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but the portions are huge. Friend ordered the Bibimbap ($21~) but it was monstrous in size and the bulgogi was tender and juicy. 

I recommend the Tonokotsu over their OBON ramen. The OBON ramen was a little too salty. I enjoyed my Tonkotsu ramen and it was a pretty decent portion as well. All their drinks are pretty unique and tasty. 

The Tira-miso was DELICIOUS. It was so fluffy and creamy and SO GOOD. 

Will def be back some day, but it's a little bit on he pricey side of things."}
{"text":"Ordered Kimchi Rice and it had a bitter taste.  Ordered 2 orders of Noodles and was told that they only had enough noodles for one.  Papaya Salad was shockingly a small portion. Would not return!"}
{"text":"Loved it had the special roman 
The shredded pork was a. It different but I really liked it mixed well with the roman!!"}
{"text":"My second visit to OBON was for lunch and it wasn't great. The food was severely lacking. 

Crispy calamari was ok as an appetizer but I wouldn't recommend it. 

The poke bowl was pretty awful, especially for $17, there are places that serve more fish and decently cooked rice for $12-14. The sauce overpowered everything else in the bowl.


I might be back but it will only be for the ramen."}
{"text":"The sushi here wasn't the usual but was good.  Interesting rolls, not super great but good. The korean beef dish I hadn't great, it was very little beef, lots of rice and a fire hot (not good hot) red sauce that I wasn't too thrilled with.

The negri that we ordered was excellent. If I were to go back I might upgrade to 4 stars and stick to the interesting Negri (wow that is different as this is usually the ordinary)."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I think this is an example of a restaurant trying to do too much and not doing any of it really well. We had the Ramen sushi and some appetizers. All of the dishes were mediocre nothing really stood out. If you're really interested in getting Ramen I would recommend the Republic of Ramen in Tempe. There are definitely better sushi restaurants around. Nice atmosphere and helpful staff but not a restaurant we will be going back to."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior, friendly staff, and convenient location being in the Scottsdale Quarter. That's about all the pros I have for this place. This place is a cute date place but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for authentic ramen. It's... kinda... Caucasian to be honest. The food is a bit overpriced for the quality and taste, but then again, it's in Biltmore. I'd recommend Tempopo if you're looking for more authentic ramen taste but OBON is excellent for a date night!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arizona hands down!!! Had the Machi with the sesame infused Ameretto and Jasmin rinse. The Tataki Maki g is on point!!! Had the bird, pork, crab and yes I am saying it \"Spam\" steamed buns. They were all so delicious, definitely addictive! Management is great and it really shows through the staff. Definitely a must go!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Sushi is delicious here!! The Ramen is INCREDIBLE. The staff is the BEST! Two thumbs up. ."}
{"text":"I LOVE ramen! This ramen is great!

I got the Tonkotsu ramen with a spice bomb. The broth is great-very rich and deep flavor. The egg is a soft poached egg, which I love! The yolk is so rich and creamy. Noodles are thin and chewy, as they should be. Char-sui is okay....I prefer a little more fat and thicker pieces. The spice bomb is great, but definitely spicy! Overall, really great ramen. 

Strip sushi - really great. Comes with 4 pieces. 

A little pricey, but considering the location... BUT the bowl of ramen is definitely big enough to eat just that and be full."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for happy hour. Was pleasantly surprised to see some common Korean dishes on the menu and even more excited that these Korean dishes tasted pretty authentic not to mention delicious.

I started off with the Korean cooler. Tasted just like the yogurt drink I used to drink as a kid mixed w soju. Very good. Then I started off w panfried gyoza and crispy shrimp. I was a little disappointed there weren't more happy hour options besides $2 off selected menu items. 

Then I ordered the jalapeño albacore crisp dish which came out so pretty topped w flowers. It was delicious! The mix of jalapeño n cucumber w the albacore was delicious! 

I also got the tataki maki signature roll. Spicy crab, shrimp tempura, avocado topped w seared tuna was not what I was expecting. I personally did not like the chimichurri sauce topped on the roll. It was a weird combo and wished I got it w out this sauce.

As my main dish, I got the kimchi fried rice (a Korean favorite of mine! Comfort food!) and it was the best!! The portion was huge so I was happy to take some left overs. My husband got the chicken teriyaki and I had a bite and it was perfection!! The shiitake mushrooms and the Korean bbq crisp edges of the chicken is what made this dish!! 

Overall, if you're a fan of good Asian food, I would recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The food was good.    The Ambience is cool, contemporary, and comfortable.  But the bad attitude of a server can really ruin your experience.  I ordered a Calamari salad, and my friend ordered a few small sushi/sashimi dishes which included Sea Bass sashimi. The first thing that came out was a salmon crudo which was delicious with its fresh vinegar based dressing with daikon slices.  Then another server brought out a tataki tuna salad, yellowtail sushi and another item my friend did order.  We were a bit confused - I'd ordered Calamari salad and our server insisted I ordered tataki tuna salad.   My friend also confirmed that I ordered a calamari salad.  finally the server took the salad back.  My friend's sea bass sashimi didn't come out about 20 minutes into our eating... so she asked where it was, and to that, the server said that the last item that came out was the sea bass nigiri, and that that was all she had on the order.  My friend asked her to check the form after about 2 minutes of debating this, the server went back to the kitchen. We didn't see her for good 10 minutes. When she came back, she said the kitchen is working on the Sea Bass sashimi. My friend asked \"so was the form filled out correctly?\" to this, the server says \"oh, I threw the paper out - but it doesn't matter, we are making the sashimi for you\". Liar!!!  Why would the server throw the paper out especially when she was insisting the form was filled out incorrectly by my friend?  My friend and I weren't born yesterday!  After spending nearly $100 for not a huge amount of food, including a generous tip for a bad service, my friend as apologizing to me for the bad attitude-server. Of course, it wasn't my friend's fault for choosing a restaurant she'd never been to.  I doubt that she would ever return to this place.  I probably won't either.
I didn't see any manager-type person present.  The business must not care too much about how the customers are treated.  It may be a cool place to eat, and the food might even be pretty good.  But then there is a ton of other sushi and or Korean food places around.  I feel completely OK to say that I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I have been going three or four times a week!
I don't think I can get sick of the food. Diverse menu, friendly barkeep, not expensive."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night. There was no wait for a table but we did not receive a server until 30 mins after we arrived. We had to ask the server taking care of the table next to us for water. We waited 30 mins and still no one took our order so we again asked a server to place an order. Ten minutes after, our server greeted us for the first time & gave me a ramen spoon and walked away. No \"I'm sorry for the delay\" or \"your food will be out shortly\" nothing. After waiting another 20 mins with no food we asked to speak to a manager. The manager was nice enough to apologize & comp our meals. She also offered a dessert but we didn't take it. After the bad experience and dealing with how noisy it was in the restaurant, we just wanted to leave. The server only apologized after being confronted by the manager. She was more focused on serving another party of only 4 people. The ramen I ordered was expensive & hardly had any meat in it. The noodles were gummy & the broth was ginger based and extremely salty. The food was plated nicely though. Bottom line, it's a newer place that doesn't know how to handle busy nights. I wouldn't recommend, and wouldn't go again just based on the food alone."}
{"text":"Pretty good place located in the Scottsdale Quarter! I love the ambiance of this place and it's always clean and the service is always great. 

They have a pretty awesome drink menu with lots of creative things so I like to go here for happy hour. 

The food is pretty good...I really like their veggie roll as it's more than just carrot, cucumber, and avocado. Their avocado roll is pretty good too with large chunks of avocado. The seaweed tastes like quality seaweed and is way better than your traditional sushi you get anywhere else. The wasabi also appeared to be made in house or it's a really high quality brand. 

I looooove ramen but can't eat the ramen here because there's egg in the noodles and I'm vegan. I wish they had a vegan option so bad because I'd probably be here every day lol. I can only eat so many veggie and avocado rolls before I get sick of it. You'd think a place that specializes in ramen would have something for everyone."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and appetizers last weekend and sat at the bar from the patio. Had a good experience, delicious (and very interesting) drinks, and some good appetizers. Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a casual place to eat with a unique twist.

I look forward to coming back and having a full dining experience!"}
{"text":"awesome service! hosts were welcoming and helpful. 
Server was fun and very knowledgeable of the menu. Great atmosphere! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting too much from OBON when we were looking for a quick bite to eat while shopping at Scottsdale Quarters. We decided on OBON ramen and rainbow poke. 
OBON ramen had intense flavor and came with poached egg. The yolk can be popped and mixed into the broth which made it that much better. The noodles were cooked perfectly too. I'm salivate just thinking about it. It was also served with habanero paste which can be added to the broth for heat. 
The poke had very fresh cuts of fish served with sushi rice. The soy based dressing was really tasty but bit salty. I requested extra sushi rice to mix in and this made it perfect! I noticed they didn't charge me extra for the rice which was very nice! 
We also shared soft shell crab bun. It had very crispy fried crab. It was really yummy. I want to try their other buns. 
The owner must be Korean as they offered many Korean dishes. The waitress and the manager was very attentive and friendly. 
Highly recommend. I will be returning really soon."}
{"text":"We came in hungry got seated right away and there we sat. We were there over thirty minutes and only had water because we asked for it. The same for ordering our food we felt invisible to the staff. We complained and the manager apologized as did the server. The food is played beautifully and fresh. Portions are small but that's typical. The food was good but not great, and that was after being super hungry by the time it arrived. New and hot place but the have to get their rhythm down. I appreciate the apologies and that they comped our dinner. I would select another place to dine."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I've been to in Scottsdale. Ordered the jalapeño crudo and the fish looked and tasted very old with a brownish color on it. The soft shell crab bun also tasted very greasy and fishy. The only edible thing was our sushi roll which was just ok."}
{"text":"We were shopping and decided to eat here because sushi sounded good. Once we ordered our food, it took a while to get to our table: around 45 minutes. My sister and I had sushi and both agreed that they had no flavor, it was very bland; the soy sauce gave the sushi flavor. In total, we saw our waiter around 5 times, and he was very nice. Not as impressed with the food as I expected, but the atmosphere was groovy. I may come back again, but I'll order something besides sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Obon Sushi and Ramen

Ordered the Bibimbop, Monster Roll and the Obon Ramen.

The Bibimbop was disappointing in that it was mainly lettuce and white rice and little short rib. It consist of vegetables, grilled short ribs, gochujang dressing, 64* egg, being one of the most expensive dishes at $21.

The Monster Roll was pretty good and a good size dish consist of cucumber, avocado, shrimp, crispy soft shell crab, spicy crab, cream cheese, asparagus, topped with spicy tuna, eel sauce and rice pearls.

 I enjoyed the Obon Ramen the most of all our dishes, good tasting soup base, plentiful ramen noodles, could have had more Roasted pork shoulder and pork belly, dried shredded chili, bamboo shoots, scallions, 64* egg, black garlic oil, bean sprouts but was pretty good on these items. The bowl that the ramen comes in is not your typical style ramen bowls and the size porpotion seems smaller in quantity.

Jessica our server was excellent, always there to make sure we were well taken care of, she explained a few dishes dishes to us and recommended a few of her favorite.

Been searching for a good ramen place in the North side of Phoenix or Scottsdale, even though this was a better ramen still searching for that go to ramen house like you would find in Los Angeles or San Francisco."}
{"text":"My trek in search of the best ramen was arduous. It has taken me to seedy ramen joints all across Phoenix and has finally come to an end with Obon! I found their ramen to have the best flavor out of them all. I order the pork shoulder with bamboo ramen with both the garlic chili and black bean oils for extra flavor. They have a spice shot that I also add. It reminds me of a fancy version of my childhood Top Ramen with better noodles and broth, comforting like a good bowl of chicken soup when you are sick. I would give this restaurant 5 stars if they had faster service and cost a little less. One bowl of soup is 15 dollars which is steep compared to all the other ramen places I've visited. That said, I've been here 3 times now so obviously the ramen is delicious and worth it. It also has great ambiance on the patio with a view of the sidewalk and nice foliage, come here for special events and be sure to sit outside!"}
