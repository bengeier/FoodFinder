{"text":"Oh Sushi Kee, how I love thee! I've been coming here for years ever since a friend recommended it. Im glad she did because they have awesome rolls. My favorites are the Arizona, Hurricane, Tiger, Kee, Salmon Avacodo, and the California rolls are the best! The portions are huge, the service and Chefs are awesome. I wish I lived closer so I could come here more often."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the service and quality off the food and sushi! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I came here and ordered all you can eat, and it was the worst all you can eat sushi experience I've had. While the menu descriptions sounded good, the rolls we received after ordering were just california rolls with different types of fish on top. The rolls we received barely matched the menu descriptions.

The slices of fish on the nigiri sushi were generally very small and they give HUGE chunks of rice one must finish to avoid being charged.

Worst of all, I found several bones in the albacore tuna on my nigiri sushi. I almost choked, and while I told the chef, they did absolutely nothing to remedy the situation. Most restaurants would have at the very least apologized for the bones in the sushi. I would never come back here."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé have tried almost every sushie place in Mesa Gilbert and tempe. This is now are regular spot. The happy hour which is until 8 is always great.  The tootsie roll a must try.
The service is always quick and friendly. If your a sushi person give this place a try."}
{"text":"Amazing speciality rolls; Hurricane and Nacho mama were delicious. I had the Nacho Mama without jalapeños!! Great happy hour prices also."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I come in with the hubby from time to time... Only reason I only gave four stars becasue it was a tad warm last time I went there."}
{"text":"The restaurant reeked of propane. The food was decent, but not good enough to make up for the smell."}
{"text":"great service
the vegas roll is amazing
excellent happy hour!!!!
Wish it was a bit cooler but other than that, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Eating sushi in the desert...a dangerous undertaking, as evidenced by many evenings spent hunched over a toilet. Sometimes it just doesn't seem possible to get fresh fish in the valley of the sun. Well, thank goodness for the wonders of Sushi Kee. Somehow, their fish is always fresh and tasting of the ocean. Their rolls are yummy, their sashimi a wonder, even their tempura gets it right. Pricy? Yes...but I'm paying for the piece of mind that I WON'T be spending the rest of the night in a bathroom!"}
{"text":"Love this sushi.  Reasonably priced. Happy hour prices. Dinner comes with soup and salad.  This is one of mesa's gems."}
{"text":"I frequent Sushi Kee in Mesa and absolutely love their staff, food and speed of service. That location is by far the best sushi I've ever eaten. 

I was very disappointed with the Tempe location. My boyfriend and I ordered 4 rolls and an appetizer. It took over an hour to get our 1st roll plus 10 minutes for every additional roll to hit our table. We received our appetizer when we received the check. When everything was said and done it took 1.5 hrs to get our food. The food was good but the timing was very poor and made for a sour experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi and rolls but I am not fond of their cooked dinner entrees. They have been around a long time."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices. My wife loves the place they include miso soup and a little salid with sushi. Nice staff as well"}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty awsome...always fresh and tasty. The other food on the menu is not bad either, especially the gyozas. 

The only issue I have with this place is that at times I have gone there before closing time and they were closed. I realise they don't have much business on weekday evenings, but if you have a timing posted on the door, please keep to it! 

Your food is so good that it really upsets me when I cannot get my  sushi fix."}
{"text":"The best sushi place in town! I had the Alaskan and California roll with saki and miso soup. HAVING LIVED IN TOKYO FOR A YEAR, this place keeps the same methods and taste with an American spin. The rolls/food are better than ra sushi or stingrays sushi rolls at half the price. The owner is Shawn and he is very polite and has great attention to detail. The fish was fresh, the veggies were crisp, the rice was tasty and service was great! The rolls are BIG AND WORTH EVERY PENNY, atmosphere is wonderful(nice and cozy) and it's like taking a vacation back to Tokyo. The best hidden gem I ever found!!!! Customer for life!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot with decent quality fish (sometimes hard to find in AZ) and great happy hour pricing. Reminds me of our old go-to spot in OC. Service has been prompt every time we've been, and it's not overcrowded like some other spots."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out because of the good reviews people have given this place on Yelp.  People talked about how great the food was and how fair the price was for all-you-can-eat sushi; however, my experience with this place was thoroughly disappointing.  I gave this place a 2nd star as a benefit of the doubt.. perhaps I just happened to have picked a bad day to eat at this place.

First, the service was HORRIBLE.  We asked for a table for 3, and instead of simply pulling an extra chair up two a 2-seated table, the waitress sat us at a table for 6, only to have a party of 8 walk in the door a minute after I had started on my soup, so she asked us to move to a different table so they could have our table.  This wouldn't have been so bad if it was the only problem we ran into for the night.

Next, because the staff was in such a rush to move us, they took my salad away before I was actually finished with it.  Not a great way to start my all-you-can-eat experience.

Third, when we put in our sushi order, the waitress had to clarify whether we were ordering nigiri per order (2 pieces) or per piece.  We specified that we wanted 2 pieces for every number we indicated on the sushi sheet.  She nodded and brought our order to the chef.  The first half of our order came out fine. We got the number of pieces we asked for, but when the 2nd half of our order came out, the sushi chef decided to interpret our orders as \"per piece\" so we only received one piece of every sushi ordered on the bottom half of the order sheet.  I guess it's no big deal, since we could always order more, but it took us a good 45 minutes just to get all of this order, we didn't know how much longer we'd have to wait to order everything again.  

The staff was also bad with keeping up with who they had already served soup & salad to and who they have not served yet (I happened to receive mine, but the person who showed up later in our group got nothing), and they were slow at refilling drinks too.  It might be because they got busy after the 1st hour we were there, but we wouldn't have dined for 2.5 hours if their service wasn't as slow.  

Also, the three sushi chefs who were working all disappeared at the same time, and were gone for about 5 minutes.  What kind of restaurant leaves the sushi bar completely unattended during the peak dinner hour?!?!?!

Aside from the service, the food selection was not great as it did not really include any appetizers, had limited all-you-can-eat sushi selection, and did not include any dessert.  We could've driven another 2 minutes down the block to another sushi restaurant that could've provided all the above mentioned items with same quality or even better quality fish than Sushi Kee for the same all-you-can-eat price of $20 per person.  

As for food quality, it was pretty decent.  It is among some of the freshest quality fish I've had in sushi restaurants, but there are definitely plenty of other places that could provide better quality fish as well.  The quality of Sushi Kee's fish is not enough to bring be back here again.

In summary, I would not go back to eat here knowing that Mido Sushi's only a block away.  I also would not recommend any of my friends to eat here either.  While the food quality was ok, the service and poor food selection definitely ruined the experience for me.  Had the service been better, I wouldn't mind recommending people to this place, but in all honesty, Mido Sushi truly can provide more options, better quality fish, and better service for the same exact price, so why waste time in trying this place out?"}
{"text":"Continues to impress me as a highly competent sushiya. Portions are generous, fish is fresh, flavors are good. They'll remain my sushiya of choice for those occasions when I can't make it to Sushi Ken in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced sushi happy hour, portions were average sized, around two fingerwidths. Salmon and tuna were very fresh, no spider rolls here, rice was a bit loose, the ajumma here were very friendly, folks usually order to go, but I liked it."}
{"text":"Prices are average, food was decent, variety of fish is narrow and I find myself asking how fresh some of the fish is. Nigiri and sashimi shouldn't have a strong fishy taste or smell. Especially at a premium price. I've had better."}
{"text":"I have had sushi literally on the beach. Cancun, San Diego, etc... All more expensive places also. This is the best sushi I have ever had in Az! Fish quality is fantastic and the sushi chef himself is a very nice guy! Been there 3 times in the last 3 months and the staff is already familiar with my girlfriend and I. Service can be kind of slow (sometimes) but they make up for it by being very friendly, personal and having GREAT sushi. I absolutely love sushi and am extremely picky about it. I choose to go here for a reason."}
{"text":"First time trying Sushi Kee a few weeks ago. I ordered the hot poppers and Las Vegas roll. The hot poppers where wonderful, very good. I thought the Las Vegas roll was okay. It was to big to get the whole flavor of the roll into a one mouth full. Over all the staff was great the place was clean and very nice."}
{"text":"Sushi tasted really fresh. Seating was immediately available. Wait staff was new/training, but very helpful. Happy hour runs until 8pm!!! We paid happy hour prices, but the regular prices seem competitive. We stayed past the 9pm closing, but people were kind and patient for us and the other party that remained after closing. Recommend giving Sushi Kee a try."}
{"text":"Found on Power rd and best place around and did I mention fresh and huge portion will be regular fer sure"}
{"text":"Excellent Happy Hour prices for lunch. Sushi is awesome. Service is fast. Generous portions and great wasabi. (Yeah that mattets to me). I will definitely be back! Next time, I'm bringing my friends."}
{"text":"Fresh, clean, ahhhmazing sushi!  Always our \"go-to\" place.  Quick, friendly service and a great value.  The tuna is always super light and clean.  Our favorites are the Kee Roll, ASU roll, Spider and the Las Vegas.  The calamari is excellent and they have a pungent sauce that is amazing (ask for it)."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been eating there since they opened. As a matter of fact Sharen and I were the first two people to drink a beer in the restaurant. We were there for lunch and they had just received their liquor license and the first shipment of beer was delivered. We had warm beer, just so we could say we were the first to drink there. 

The food is consistently awesome. I have literally eaten there about twice a month since the day they opened. The fish is fresh, the portions are large and the staff is great. If you have not had it before I recommend you ask for the fresh wasabi, it will really clear your sinuses out.

A couple of times a year we end up eating sushi at some other place and are always let down. We haven't been to a place yet, that compares. I say you will not be disappointed. Which is a pretty bold claim to make about a restaurant in Mesa."}
{"text":"We've had a hard time finding sushi we are crazy about in the valley and are SOOOO glad we came across this place! My exact words upon trying it for the first time were \"See! THIS is what sushi is supposed to taste like!\" We're California natives and haven't been too impressed since trying the sushi here in AZ (we judge a place on quality of food, not ambiance) and were pretty sure we just wouldn't find a place we loved before trying Sushi Kee. Now we have a place to get our take out every Friday night!! My favorite is the Kee Roll."}
{"text":"How does that saying go?  \"First love never dies\" ?
Well that just happens to be the case here.  This was the first place I ever tried sushi and it is still my absolute favorite.  The service has changed a bit since when I first went 6 years ago but the sushi is just as amazing as ever!

I have gone elsewhere for sushi, tried places my friends would rave about but honestly, they just haven't compared to Sushi Kee.  Maybe I'm bias because it was my first but in my opinion it can't be beat.

Go for yourself, see how packed this little place gets on a Friday night.  All those people can't be wrong!"}
{"text":"There is no service in this restaurant. 

I ordered ramen noodle and some sushi last week. After 20 mins I asked the waitress when the ramen will be ready, she went back to the kitchen and disappeared. I need to ask again where is my noodle. Then the waitress told me they forgot my order. I were the only customer at that time, how could they forget it?

If you forgot my order, just let me know, it was not appropriate just disappear and pretend nothing happened. At least give some apologies.

Oh, you need to keep asking for water, the waitress were just chatting and not working."}
{"text":"Sadly, I wasn't impressed at all. The sushi rolls are so huge that when you eat them, they fall apart everywhere. The sushi was drowning in Eel Sauce, all over my plate. So sweet. The albacore tuna nigiri that I ordered was slathered in ginger sauce. It tasted so bad and very strong fishy flavor. Not fresh tasting at all. Very disappointing for a place that normally gets 4 stars here on Yelp. Service was ok, but nothing to get excited over. I am sorry I will not be back, mostly because the sushi quality was just, very poor."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Sushi Kee for the first time last night, having driven by it a thousand times without a second thought given the neighborhood and the simple exterior.  We had seen the good reviews and, wanting something different, decided to give it a try.  At first we were prepared to be disappointed.  When we arrived there was only one waitress working and she was so distracted by a technical issue with the credit card machine that it took us nearly twenty minutes to even get our menus.  The complimentary salad had an interesting dressing but my portion, at least, was nearly 1/3 dressing and utterly overwhelmed the lettuce.  I can also honestly say that I have never had such bland miso soup in my life.  Not an auspicious start to the meal.

Despite the rough beginning, we were very happy to learn that every Sunday, Monday and Tuesday is all-day Happy Hour, for which the entire menu is discounted.  We tried three rolls and two orders of nigiri and our bill was only a little over $40.  The rest of the week, Happy Hour ends at 6:30.  

Our first roll, the name of which escapes me, we only ordered out of curiosity because we had never seen a sushi roll with cheese and this one had tempura shrimp, avocado, cream cheese and mozzarella.  While it was an interesting experience we would definitely not order it again.  It was so heavy and greasy that we really didn't feel like we were even eating sushi.

Everything after that roll, though, was excellent!  The Salmon Skin Roll was perfect and the 9-1-1 Roll was very fresh and tasty.  Unfortunately, there was only one sushi chef and he was clearly in a hurry, as the rolls were not as neat and well-formed as one would hope.  It was clear that presentation was not a priority at Sushi Kee, which detracted some from the meal.

Where the restaurant really shined, though, was the nigiri.  It's been mentioned before, but the nigiri pieces are very big, well priced and fresh.  We initially only ordered tuna and unagi but had to request another order of the unagi because it was just so delicious.  My friend commented that the rice had the best flavor that she could recall at any sushi restaurant that we've visited.  

While Sushi Kee won't score a perfect five stars from us do to the lack of polishing on the edges, we will definitely be back.  We are already planning another visit during one of the Happy Hour days, but this time we will simply stick to the nigiri."}
{"text":"This has been our go to sushi restaurant for the last 9 years.  We rave about it to all our friends.  Unfortunately, last night was nothing to rave about.  The service was horrible, and we waited almost 2 hours for our sushi. The place was not even full, though to their credit , there was only 1 person making sushi and there is usually 2.  
When we finally got our sushi, the rice and rolls just fell apart.  They were certainly was not the sushi we were used to.  Then there was a piece of Saran Wrap left on my sushi roll that almost made it into my mouth.  When i told the waitress she just smiled and said ok, thank you.  She had no clue what i was trying to tell her."}
{"text":"Always consistently good sushi. Have eaten here many times and it is always great. The Arizona roll is my personal favorite. Tiger roll is also good. Have not had anything here that I did not like. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"My uncle Scott loves this place with a passion so i decided to try out their sushi. The nigiri portions are large. Normally you will find a small thin slice of fish on top of a little mound of rice, but not here. The fish is thick and overlapping the ball of rice. You are served soup and salad regardless of what you order. I have been here 3 times in the last couple months and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Updating review. I had previously been very happy here but today the service was sub par. It took over 15 minutes to order, my friends bento box came out well before my two rolls from the lunch menu. After 45 minutes, My friend was finished eating and I still didn't have any food. I ended up canceling my order which they hadn't even started making and leaving without eating. Disappointed as my first trip there was so positive. I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! The sushi is always really great, but the staff is even better! Love coming here. I go to AZ for work all the time and I always make it a point to have dinner here at least once a night if not more! Go, have fun! Cheers"}
{"text":"What a cute little sushi restaurant! A co-worker decided to try this little gem out after deciding our normal spot just was too busy at lunchtime to get us in and out on time. 
I'm so glad we found Sushi Kee! It's in a small shopping center and was not busy at all. There was one other customer eating when we arrived. I hope at dinner time they are busier as I'd hate to see this place close.
We had originally decided on sushi until we saw the menu. They offer a bento box for $9.95. The menu gives you four columns and you chose 1 item from each column. I opted for the spicy tuna roll, cucumber salad, tempura shrimp and veggies and the teriyaki chicken. Each box also comes with a bowl of some of the best miso soup I've ever had! It had a nice smooth flavor that was not overly briny. It was garnished with tofu and small scallion slices. 
My co-worker decided on the seaweed salad, crunch rolls, edemame, and the Orange chicken. We both ended up taking to go boxes with us. We received 4 pieces of sushi, a decent sized portion of the entrée, and my tempura came with 10 pieces! It is a lot of food for one person at well priced.
 My favorite was easily the cucumber salad. Thin slices of cucumber on a soy based dressing with sesame seeds adding a nutty flavor. It was very cool and refreshing on a hot and humid August day. We saw a surf and turf roll on the menu that we both decided we wanted to come back and try. The waiter was attentive but not overly so. It has a cute Asian themed decor with lots of umbrellas. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went to this place based of Yelp reviews. I'm from Tucson and my wife wanted sushi. We were ecstatic at how good it was. i am on a special diet, so i got Sashimi and some seaweed salad and both were amazing. My kids got noodles and those were as good as any we have had in Arizona. Simply put, this place was really good and the next time we are in Tempe we will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"In this review I'm going to break it up into three different sections: Ambiance, food quality/price, and service. Just walking in the door, the layout and vibe is very aesthetic. Seating is available at the bar itself, or on the restaurant floor as well for larger groups. I've been to several sushi restaurants around Arizona, but this one by far has the most authentic look and feel to it, most certainly not some modernized \"nightclub\" sushi bar, serving Americanized rolls. To add onto the very pleasing appearance, there is a large, beautiful fish tank, filled with an assortment of exotic fish, right behind the bar. Don't be fooled by the exterior appearance, or its location, because the interior makes up for any of the blemishes outside. There is also very quiet ambient music just so you can perfectly hear it, but not have it drown out any conversation you may be having or have it be an uncomfortable in the slightest. The appearance and feel of the restaurant undoubtedly enhance food and experience you have when you step foot in the establishment. 

Heed my warning when I tell you that this restaurant will ruin any other sushi for you. This is the best sushi available in Arizona, or any other state I've travelled to. You may think you know sushi, but until you've ventured out to Sushi Kee, you don't know good sushi. There are rolls available for any type of person, even people who don't regularly enjoy sushi. I made a trip there with my girlfriend, who doesn't enjoy sushi whatsoever, and she fell in love with the rolls that are deep fried. The place also puts their own refreshing spin on classic sushi rolls, such as spicy tuna, making the quality spectacular. Don't eat sushi? No problem. They also have delicious alternatives that are available if you're that type of person who got stuck into going to a sushi restaurant and you don't even enjoy it. I personally recommend the chicken katsu, which is a Japanese twist on chicken tenders, served with a savory sweet sauce and a scoop of rice, making the dish very delectable. Delicious appetizers are available as well, such as tempura (shrimp or veggie), served with a flavorful sake sauce. To sum it all up for you, I haven't ordering anything on the menu that hasn't completely satisfied me. The food is all moderately priced and I can't complain with that. You feel as if you're getting this type of quality for a steal, as opposed to going to a previously mentioned modernized sushi bar and buying overpriced, mediocre sushi.   

The service is very timely and friendly. The server and sushi chef have items available at a very reasonable time, not taking away from any of the quality. I was very surprised to place my order to the server, and within little time I was enjoying the food I ordered. The service provided is also very happy to bring you anything you need such as condiments and utensils (if you're unable to use chopsticks). The workers there really seem to enjoy their job and that is a very refreshing attitude to have towards customers, which isn't displayed at many other restaurants. If you want to go to an authentic, delicious sushi restaurant, with very friendly and timely service, I suggest that you don't hesitate in heading down over to Sushi Kee, you won't be any less than completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Okay, so its a very strange location - a little south of the intersection of Power and Main in Mesa. Not glamorous by any means. But, this, by far, has been the best sushi place that I've found in Arizona - sorry, Scottsdale. Its a small place, and very busy, but extremely welcoming. The people here are so nice - if you visit twice, they'll remember you. You're not just another party for dinner - you're a guest. The food is awesome and so fresh. The portions are generous and the quality is outstanding. The caterpiller roll is something my kids love - sprout antennae, sliced avocado segments and all - very cute, very well done. The Kee's roll has very thin slivers of sliced lemon on top - my husband's favorite. I can't think of anything we didn't like. The octopus salad is a gift from the gods. Prices are okay - you won't spend a fortune, but don't expect a cheap dinner either. I could rave on and on. This is one of my very favorite, all time restaurants."}
{"text":"Been going here for a few years.  Always great service and delicious, fresh food.  Like another reviewer said, you know it's a good sushi place when it's Japanese-owned.
The negative reviewers probably went on a (rare) bad day or are just big complainers in general."}
{"text":"Good Japanese food. I went for lunch and got a beautiful bento box. They have fair prices and a full selection of sake. Their miso was good, with large pieces of tofu and lots of seaweed. I would recommend it to anyone. (I loved the ceiling covered in paper umbrellas)"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in East Mesa. I found Sushi Kee about 8 years ago. The sushi is awesome. Prices are reasonable. Small, quaint and not a corporate chain."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! It was our first time dining here. no disappointments at all. Plus--they have happy hour every day of the week! Glad our friends introduced us to this sushi restaurant.  We will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best sushi I have ever had....they take a little long to prepare the sushi so don't go if in a hurry, but very worth the wait and not expensive at all...happy hour Monday through Friday 5pm-8pm. Definitely my new go to place for sushi!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place, great prices, big portions, and no trendy BS!"}
{"text":"Just flew in from San Fran and heading to Tucson; wanted to eat something light. We ordered the salmon, tuna, nigiri and sashimi. It was delicious, every bite melted in my mouth and the pieces were generously cut.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Being going here a little more often. Tonight I got the ASU roll which was pretty tasty. The Ms. got the yellow tail and the kid got the California roll both enjoyed their selection. The have great service here. Definitely a good spot."}
{"text":"Being going here a little more often. Tonight I got the ASU roll which was pretty tasty. The Ms. got the yellow tail and the kid got the California roll both enjoyed their selection. The have great service here. They even let me put game 3 of the World Series. Definitely a good spot."}
{"text":"Sushi kee is one of mesa,s best kept secrets,their daily happy hours are incredible,their portion sizes are generous and their staff is friendly and fast.Try their amazing salmon, FRESH AND FABULOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a crowded place in a quiet stop mall, so I took a seat a the sushi bar.  Was going to order a Chirashi off the menu but couldn't get any waitress' attention before I gave up.  I always preferred Chirashi because it offers more variety of fish at a good price.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed a simple meal.  By the way, the sushi chiefs and the waitress spoke Korean, so I assume it's owned by Korean.  It's always a turn off for me that a Japanese restaurant not owned by Japanese....

The sushi chief is very friendly, don't get me wrong.  However, I don't think it is the \"best sushi\" but again I don't know how other sushi places are in AZ."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for lunch today, and we just love it! the fish is very fresh and tastes great! I had the luncheon sushi platter that has 4 pieces of tempura with a great pony sauce and generous sized servings of sushi on rice with ginger and sushi off to the side! It was delicious!  we've been coming here  for 10 years and hope to keep coming for another ten!
This time I even ordered Green Tea ice cream for desert for us to try~ crispy and sweet on the outside~~absolutely delicious!!!! Give it a try! We had a great time, and our hostess was a darling person who's husband owns it~ give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Liked the lunch combo for a deal, but dinner was pricey or average high. Do not eat non sushi/sashimi here. You'll regret. Lol"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, and finally decided to write a review.  Long overdue.... Sushi Kee has never failed me.  The menu won't disappoint, the chefs are outstanding, and the \"all-you-can-eat\" special for 20 bucks brings the whole thing together.  After trying almost every other sushi bar in town, I always head back to the Kee..."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here on a date night and I was not disappointed! Every roll was delish! This is def a date night spot, small, low key, great prices and delicious."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a new sushi place to try, definitely try Sushi Kee! My fiancé and I ate there for the first time tonight and the sushi was incredible, the service was great, and the food came out very quickly. And the best part? The prices are more than reasonable and happy hour goes until 8! It definitely made our \"favorites\" list for sushi!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. SERIOUSLY!!  I've tried many sushi restaurants in town, but Sushi Kee offers great size rolls with amazing taste. The staff is super friendly and they offer complimentary salad and miso soup with every meal."}
{"text":"Good sushi and very friendly service. More people should recognize a well hidden gem. Also really good happy hour!"}
{"text":"A different day perhaps a different star rating.  I'm on the fence about this place.  It almost seems like a different owner every time I go there.  I think their bento box lunch is a great deal and so are their $9.99 dinners entrées with a sushi roll.  Sometimes the service, fish and the whole experience is great and sometimes it is not.  Last night we went and did not sit at the bar because the whole family went.  We always get the sashimi combo at $24.99 it is a decent deal.  I liked all the fish on the platter last night except for the halibut.  It did not taste fresh to me.  The service was a little off last night too.  I have noticed when they get busy it is hard for them to keep up.  On a personal note, I prefer the sashimi to come out first because I get full on the rice and you typically pay more for the sashimi.  My only other complaint was that the fish was extremely cold.  The fish pieces are bigger then what you will find at a lot of other sushi places."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out today. I guess it was ok. I was expecting better due to other Yelper's review. We had squid salad which was really good. The Murphy roll that other was suggesting was not that good. It was kinda sweet for our taste. It like mini dessert sushi roll. Just saying. 
We also had Las Vegas roll that was pretty good. I'm always a big fan of Las Vegas roll it don't matter what sushi place. We also got the Calamari which I think it was kinda over cooked? Texture was kinda rubbery my wife said. The portion was pretty small too compared to Ra sushi that's my opinion.
As far as the pricing it was ok. Happy hour pricing is not a big deal. You save .25-$1 maybe depending what items you're going to get. 
You can save 10% though if you go to their website for the coupon."}
{"text":"I stopped in here a little after 1pm (they close at 2 and open again in the evening). It's not in the nicest part of Mesa, so I was worried how it would be inside. But it's a nice little hole in the wall. It's clean and the service was friendly.

I ordered the lunch sushi combo (which is 8 pcs sushi, 2 pc shrimp tempura, 2 pc vegetable tempura for $9) and some eel and avocado rolls. When it came out, I was shocked by the amount of fish. For me, I hate when you order sushi and its a giant lump of rice with a tiny sliver of fish on top. These sushi were a small lump of rice with a slab of fish. It's like two pieces of generously sliced sashimi, no kidding. In fact, I just moved half the fish to the rice and ate the other half as sashimi. The fish was fresh and good.

The roll was really good too. It was a little bigger/wider than I normally like. But the flavors were good, and again, lots of eel.

All of that food, plus a bowl of miso, a salad and a mug of green tea cost $18. That's a great value. So yeah, Sushi Kee may not ever win any culinary awards. They presentation isn't as good as what you might find in much more expensive Japanese restaurants. But they are good and a great value. If you want a lot of good sushi without taking out a second mortgage, check out Sushi Kee."}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh and the service is good. Kee focuses on the freshness and preparation of traditional sushi. This is not the place to go if you want a bunch of specialty rolls."}
{"text":"Great sushi, good variety, good pricing. Outside appearance is average but atmosphere inside is warm and inviting. Wait staff very polite and accommodating. Sushi rolls were very good. Murphy roll is a warm roll that is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It looks like a hole in the wall but their sushi is amazing.....I suggest the nacho mama roll.....so good."}
{"text":"H and I have been on a bit of a sushi kick lately, the sushi cravings are strong. Just about once a week we have been trying a new sushi restaurant in the area close by us.  So far, this is our favorite.  Don't plan on coming for a Saturday lunch, they are not open, but they do have a great happy hour.  We have been here two weeks in a row.  There is a large selection of items at good prices on the HH menu.   Fresh sushi, fast service, great prices.  I'd give this a 4.5 if I could.  Try the Phoenix roll, it's my favorite."}
{"text":"Unlike other sushi places, fish at Kee's does not sit for days in its glass case.  Kee's fish is so fresh, I wouldn't be surprised to see it hop off my plate.  Presentation is delightful and often unusual.  The blue fin tuna is my favorite.  The best in the Valley by far.  If you're new to sushi, the excellent service staff will be more than happy to guide you to a wonderful dining experience.  Kee's is fantastic.  ...  All You Can Eat, however, has been discontinued, at least as I wrtie this in June 2012."}
{"text":"A nice sushi spot in South Tempe. Not sure if I'll come back, but the waitress was quite helpful. Also, be sure to try the surf 'n turf roll."}
{"text":"This is my second time here!! Had to review it twice to get my point across! great service! amazing food! This place is now at the top of my sushi places!!! prices are so great!!! The rolls have so much flavor and taste fresh !!! Ugggh I'm so full it's ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"Forget the hype of  RA and other Scottsdale sushi joints.  If you want excellent fresh sushi look no further that Sushi Kee..  Chef Kee serves some of the best fish we have had in all the PHX area.  Make sure to get Toro when they have it (not the so called toro that is served elsewhere - this is the real deal!)"}
{"text":"I've been going there for years. It's the best sushi in the East Valley. They are very friendly and always give me a gift at Christmas. The fish is very fresh and reasonably priced. They get creative with there rolls and specials."}
{"text":"A gem. Sushi Kee is wonderful. Their rolls are fresh and delicious. I haven't had one roll here I didn't like.  And the staff is great. They're always welcoming, friendly and happy to see you."}
{"text":"I would give this place 2.5 stars if I could- its not quite 2, not quite 3 either.

Service was really slow and awkward. By awkward, I mean they served me first, waited until I had finished my entire meal, waited a few more minutes, and then finally brought my fiancés food out. Watching each other eat and doubling our time in the restaurant wasn't exactly what we were going for.

I was also unpleasantly surprised to find out that the albacore tuna sashimi was not only seared on the outside, but seasoned. I ordered sashimi specifically because I am on a strict diet, so to have my food come out covered in salt and dipped in what tasted like soy sauce was unsettling.

On a happier note, everything tasted great, and they have fantastic happy hour pricing on a lot of dishes. My finances phoenix roll was amazing, and definitely something I would order again... if we ever planned on coming back."}
{"text":"Really good. The fish was fresh and the combinations of everything was delicious. Our 6 year old loved his dumplings and even ate some sushi! We will be back for sure. The place was adorable and everyone was very helpful."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Mesa by far!! We always venture out to experience other Japanese style food and sushi and always return to Sushi Kee. Large portions and a reasonable price. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first trip here and wow we were amazed! This cute little gem tucked away in a strip mall. We ordered 3 different spicy rolls and boy were they spicy!! Usually we are disappointed because most places are no where near spicy. Not here my mouth was on fire!! Everything was delicious and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Go for lunch. You won't be disappointed. 

$9.99 for a \"Bento box\" - which doesn't come in a bento box, but is delicious just the same. You get your choice of 4 items on the menu for your bento box - I like the spicy California roll, tofu salad (with the ginger dressing - which is amazing - I wish I could eat this dressing every day) spring rolls and teriyaki chicken. Firecracker chicken is deceiving - it's really like buffalo chicken. Service is very fast and well worth the $9.99.  Tons of food - and very inexpensive."}
{"text":"I'm pretty familiar with sushi. By far, this is the best sushi I've had on this side of town. Melt in your mouth fresh. Presentation is lovely. Rolls are made with care. Atmosphere is nice and mostly quiet. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is a little bit slow service, I'd give 4.5 if i could. Once the order was placed food came out pretty quickly though, so the chef is on point. I have not had any of the other food here but I will definitely be back to try. Our dinner was about the same price as most sushi joints, maybe a little more, but well worth it. Was not disappointed as i have been with other restaurants. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to relax Have a bad week come here! Between the food, atmosphere, and excellent customer service it is the perfect way to unwind. My favorite dish here is the dragon roll."}
{"text":"My husband and daughter like the sushi
A star for each
I didn't care for anything. 
The rolls have too much rice and are drowned in sauces. The lighting is really poor. 
I just don't think it was worth what we paid for"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but today wasn't good. Very poor service. The worst was the tuna sashimi wasn't cold. I didn't eat enough of it to get sick. Both sashimi's were cut thick and were hard to eat with chopsticks. Did this place change ownership?"}
{"text":"This place has very good sushi.  One of my favorites is the fried sushi.  Happy hour is from open to 6:30pm.  This is located in a run down strip mall, which isn't very appealing.  Service is not too great.  Sometimes I think they forget about our table.  I've been here three times and it's always the same slow service.  I definitely recommend this place because the sushi is fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm snobby about sushi after growing up in LA and living in SF. Sushi Kee is delicious and I will totally drive myself to its strip mall destination in Mesa whenever I want a fix. Everything generally comes with a standard salad and miso soup (which are fine), but the star really is the sushi. Sashimi is no joke and there are tons of rolls from which to choose. We got a bizarre array of nude rolls, dragon rolls, unagi...so good and fresh. This place reminds me of the low key and awesome sushi restaurant I grew up next to in LA. Plus, everything goes on Happy Hour special prior to 6:30pm!"}
{"text":"I was curious about this place as this is right across the main street from us.  I walked in the restaurant and the smell was of rotten fish, it is dark and very uninviting. I thought I would try it and see if it was just a fluke, and ordered the lunch special, my sushi was placed in front of me and that was the last I saw off the waitress, I ended up paying for my drink, and told the waitress that the fish was not fresh, and smelled fishy, and that I would not feel comfortable eating this, I did not wish to get sick off of it, she shrugged at me and said suit yourself."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Sushi Kee several times or have dined in as well.  We have tried a variety of rolls including:  Las Vegas, Rainbow, Arizona, and Mesa.  All were delicious!  Lately we have been trying to avoid rice and have been ordering sashimi and other specialties like the Tiger Eye specialty.  Yum.  The sashimi is very reasonable, especially when you order the 27 piece platter.  We did not like the octopus or surf clam (Nothing to do with the restaurant as we have tried both before and not liked it).  So, today when we ordered we asked for a substitute and they agreed, no problem.  Great place!  My husband does not like seafood, so we get him a mongolian beef and everyone is happy.  :-)"}
{"text":"The search for a good sushi place continues! Large portions, but not well prepared. Tried the specialty dishes and sashimi and were disappointed with both."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with my boyfriend, feeling a little bit tentative about trying another all-you-can-eat sushi place in the Phoenix area (we've had some pretty disappointing experiences in the past). Luckily, Sushi Kee impressed us more than I thought a place that offers all-you-can-eat could. At random moments last night and even into this morning, we find ourselves blurting out, \"Man, that was some GOOD sushi...\" to a riotous chorus of agreement.

GO TO SUSHI KEE. You won't regret it. Sooooo tasty, and endless for $20 bucks (so long as you can finish everything you order). My only sadness was that they don't offer negihama maki... but it's more than made up for with all their other offerings. =P

I usually stick pretty strictly to nigiri and tekka maki/negihama maki when I go out for sushi... but even though that was exceptional here as well, I fell in love with so many of the deluxe rolls, my girlish figure is cursing at me. I kinda wish my stomach didn't bear such a strong resemblance to a black hole: I'm going to be working out all day as penance. haha. I particularly loved the midnight sun and arizona rolls, and the kee's roll was pretty damn good as well. My boyfriend swore by the alaska and tempe rolls. But we didn't order anything that wasn't MORE than palatable.

They also have some aquariums up behind the sushi bar. We shared a laugh because they were empty: it wouldn't have been very nice of them to force fish to witness what was occurring behind the counter, after all. ;]"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi spot in chandler! Could use some better lunch specials tho!! Maybe a Poke salad like RA... Just sayin"}
{"text":"Kee and Diane Hong have done it again. This is the best sushi in the valley. I regularly drive here from East Mesa for the fresh fish and the amazing Volcano Roll! Service is great and I love the beer and sake selection. And the Miso soup always matches the season. This Sushi Bar is over the top!"}
{"text":"Sushi Kee on Power Road is spot on! This place has been making great sushi and sashimi for years. The Chef has been trained by the original Kee Hong and does a great job. Only place in Mesa that I eat sushi at. Always fresh and great service. My wife and kids are always asking to go out for sushi and that always means Sushi Kee!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to sushi kee in Chandler and really liked it, so I had high hopes for this location. We ordered 5 rolls and they came out on a large tray together and everything looked good.. But I learned not to
Judge a book by its cover. The sushi didn't taste fresh and the rice seemed off.. Had a bad fishy smell. I ate two pieces before deciding it wasn't worth the possibility of getting sick over. I'm not one to complain at restaurants unless there's really a problem, and this was one of those times. Only reason I'm not giving one star is because the waitress was really helpful and took the rolls off our bill even when we offered to pay for some since we ordered so many."}
{"text":"Before I go into my personal experience about this restaurant I want to give you, the reader, my feedback of the food. 

DISCLAIMER: I could care less about rolls, my review only pertains to nigiri sushi. 

For AYCE Sushi, my criteria is as follows, and as always I judge the food relative to price so in this case I will review sushi kee as a $20 AYCE sushi joint. My criteria is as follows for AYCE sushi joints: 

Fish to Rice Ratio. (nigiri)
- This is the second most important factor to me. AYCE sushi joints will charge you for any left over rice, and because of this most consumers tend to fill up on rice and not the good stuff. The ratio at this restaurant is horrible, the protein of the nigiri sushi is supposed to smother the rice, and the nigiri is meant to be eaten in one bite. I'm a big guy and it took me two bites to eat the sushi mainly due to the fact that they use a huge guap of rice. They seriously expect you to eat it too. 

Fish Quality. (nigiri)
- For AYCE sushi the fish quality is spot on. I would actually say its above average. 

Rice Quality. (nigiri)
- Now this is pretty standard in the sushi community and is pretty hard to mess up. My rice in my nigiri was too warm, the rice is supposed to be room temperature or a little on the colder side. The warm rice interfered with the taste of the fish.


Conclusion
- For AYCE this place sucks donkey dick. Cuts of fish are average and in some cases above average, but it still is not enough to balance the gigantic portion of rice. The AYCE menu is weak, I've eaten at other $20 AYCE sushi joints and they have items like: Quail egg over tobiko, Uni (limited), Amaebi (limited), tuna tar tar (limited). 

Personal Experience (which I'm sure is not an accurate review of the restaurant)

- Water had a nasty taste to it, informed the waiter, waiter gave us 3 options: Bottled Water, Soda, Alchohol. We opted for soda, and we paid for soda. 

- Service was slow, one chef and one helper, california rolls pre made, sashimi platter pre made, A lot of items are pre made. 

- Ambiance was nice, the joint is really clean!"}
{"text":"Went for a quite bite with my husband and it was wonderful. FRESH fish... We ordered 3 rolls, fried calamari, and pot stickers... Fast service in and out with happy hour prices... Would go back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"What is with the smell when you walk in?  It's like walking into a port-a-pottie.  Not appetizing at all.  The ambiance is not great, as you definitely know you're in a lousy strip mall.  Food was cheap at least."}
{"text":"Great sushi and very good and fast service. I have been there a few times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great sushi and a quiet atmosphere. Service can be a bit slow if its busy but worth the wait"}
{"text":"Two words....Naked Roll!!!  We travel for a living and have had a lot of sushi, and a lot of rolls (and no, I don't count California as a real roll), but NAKED ROLL!!!!  To the previous reviewer, the sashimi WAS fresh and they were huge portions (which is one reason I've been to this place over and over).  It's no conspiracy theory, they just rock!  Had some of the best white tuna I've ever had, the lettuce roll was amazing, and the fresh wasabi tuna sashimi was amazing!  Happy hour prices about made me sing, and I can't wait to come back!  Oh, and did I mention NAKED ROLL?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always delicious. Once you go there a few times you are like family. Service is good. Fish is fresh."}
{"text":"Had the miso soup and caterpillar roll for lunch. The soup was large and very good but the sushi roll was not made properly and kept on falling apart when I tried picking it up with the chopsticks.  The wasabi was not very strong and ended up using the whole amount in my soy sauce. The sushi chef took longer to make my sushi because he was more interested in watching TV instead. There was only me and another couple have lunch. My sushi  cost almost $10 for one roll and my large soup was almost $8. The atmosphere was casual. There was a large wall aquarium with absolutely no fish in it. Strange? This place is too expensive for lunch dining."}
{"text":"This small sushi shop looks like it may sub-par, but it is in fact the opposite. 
I have been there many times and it hasn't been busy enough to delay service at all. They have a good happy hour and the prices are not to bad. Their sushi is always fresh and I have never had a bad role or cut of fish. 
Their food tastes amazing, the prices are fair and the service is good. Plus the atmosphere gives you that small restaurant feel which tends to be very relaxing."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I eat here for lunch 2 times per week and it is unbeatable.  The sushi lunch combo is a great price, the size of the fish slices is great and it is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Rainbow and Phoenix rolls are highly recommended. Service was great, and for a Friday night it was surprisingly not busy."}
{"text":"High quality fish I've tasted in a while.
Salmon is to die for.
Compared to other restaurants, their rolls are pretty big for similar price. 
Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with amazing sushi. Very authentic and awesome Happy Hour. Appears that that they have very loyal customers for a good reason. Service was also on point and very attentive. Will definitely be coming back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Let me start out with OMG, freaked fantastic: service, food and service.  Down side is the place is kind of small, fills up fast so except a little  Wait time for dinner but well worth it !"}
{"text":"Service could be improved, but this sushi joint was a hidden gem inside the plaza on the corner of Warner and Rural. 

While soda from the can is not ideal, it was certainly not the end of the world and was quickly forgotten once our rolls (Ahwatukee, Jalapeño and Philly) and Chicken Teriyaki arrived. The rolls were fresh and perfectly balanced, and was the best Teriyaki bowl we've ever had. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"really good, except the spicy tuna roll which is my favorite thing everywhere else.  super nice staff, nice small restaurant.  do believe it's family owned.  we're definitely going back."}
{"text":"I love this spot for sushi. Find the sushi chef personable andbthe wait staff attentive.  We went here on a tuesday evening and it was happy hour.  So we did order off of this menu..edamami. .fried avacodo. .a sushimi dish as well as 3 rolls, everything was very good.  Beer & wine..all for under 40 bucks. Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place being my new sushi staple in Tempe. It's been forty five minutes since we ordered and the couple AND the party with a baby who arrived ten minutes after us both already got their orders. 

We came in at 7pm on a Wednesday night and the place is dead. There's like ten other people in the restaurant so them being busy isn't really an excuse. 

We also ordered the most basic shit ever off the happy hour menu (like California roll, tuna roll, etc) SO WHY IS IT TAKING A REALLY LONG ASS TIME. 

If we don't get our food in another five minutes we are walking out lol. Sorry not sorry. The couple that came later than us AND the lady with a baby are already halfway done with their food. 

Let me repeat: there's like NO ONE ELSE here lol. Am I being punk'd.

EDIT: Food never came lol. We reminded the lady and she went to go check and our food wasn't even anywhere near done LOL. We walked out. We waited for an hour for nothing."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour and it appears the order was lost.  Lacks the proper staffing to serve customers."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area. Super fast service and very friendly staff. Love that you get a small salad and miso soup too. Their dinner servings are worth the price, sesame chicken is AMAZING. Will always recommend this place to people."}
{"text":"Really delicious roll with Kim chi- I forgot what it's called but I've been craving it all week!  Yummy salmon too."}
{"text":"I have ate here now three times. The first time I ate here my wife told me I had to try it. I have passed by several times never even taking a notice at it because of the area that it was in. However I can tell you after walking into the store it's like you're in a completely different area. The staff there are very friendly, the food is awesome, the serving size is bigger than most sushi places, you would never know just how good this place is if you only judge a book by its cover. This has now become one of my favorite sushi places.

You should give it a try if you're ever in the area, I know I too fail short of not judging a book by its cover. I am so happy that my wife told me about this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Beautifully presented sushi!  Works of art that taste GREAT! 
Friendly staff."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Food is excellent. Service friendly.  Have created several special rolls with various ingredients we enjoy."}
{"text":"Wow...just discovered this place.  Fresh Sushi.  Cute and relaxing inside.  Our new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great value! It's our favorite sushi place even after trying many others. Try the firecracker or the hurricane rolls. My favorite is the good old spicy salmon roll."}
{"text":"The focus here is on excellent quality fish. I really enjoyed my sashimi. I would love more sushi options for the lunch Bento. A girl can only eat so much spicy tuna roll. The place was dead for lunch with only one other table. And of course the server disappeared when we needed the check. Probably better service when busier."}
{"text":"We just recently discovered Sushi Kee and it has quickly become our new favorite sushi place. We always go during happy hour 5-8 to get the best deals. My favorite is the Tootsie Roll and my boyfriend says the Spicy Tuna roll is the best he's had in a while. 

The service is awesome! We have always been helped right away and have not had to wait longer than 10 minutes for our food. We will be regulars from here on out!"}
{"text":"A few co-workers and I showed up at around 11:10 for lunch. We waited till 11:20 and they were still closed.  Very unprofessional.  We had to run through the drive-thru to make it back to work on time."}
{"text":"Cute environment. Nigiri was good. That's it.

Came here with my girlfriend a second time for some happy hour sushi and hot ramen. Price isn't bad for the appetizer dishes. We ordered the jalapeño poppers this time. Decent but too much cream cheese for my taste.

After eating some nigiri, our ramen was served. The Spicy Ramen was no more than packaged Korean Shin Ramen all-dressed up. If we had known what we were going to eat, we would've stayed home and made some ramen."}
{"text":"This place is the best to look out from the outside and the inside could use a few touching up colors, but the food THE FOOD is sooooo fresh rich in flavor. Service is super fast and friendly. The portions are extremely generous with the little extras. You have to ask for a fork,only chopsticks at the table. Best service is right in front of the guy making the food. Despite the homey feel of the place this is one of my new favorite sushi places to go well worth stoping in."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly. Enjoyed 5 different rolls and they were all good. The kids had yakisoba and orange chicken and both enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing. Best sushi my fiance and I have had in quite some time...and half the price!! You get a nice little salad/miso soup with your main selections and the fish super fresh and quick. Make sure and try the 911, its  rolled in cucumber!  Wonderful experience"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing sushi! Wish we lived in the area because we would be here all the time!!!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for lunch. I have never been there before but my husband has and said it was wonderful. I ordered the Bento box. The portion was very generous. The food was excellent, came out quickly and the service was great! I would definitely go back again especially for lunchtime. It is a great value!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and tried their sushi lunch combo.  The raw fish was tasty and filling.  If you're in Mesa, this is a great place to grab some yummy rolls and quench your Japanese taste buds."}
{"text":"I'm a true sushi affectianado!  It must be fresh and most importantly the chef MUST be able to customize an order from the menu. our first order was exactly that, special order! Chef didn't blink and prepared what we ordered. after a few more rolls ordered a \"chef\" choice based on our taste. hit another home run! The true measure of a sushi resturant is delivering fresh tasteful sushi that matches individual customers tastes. this is our new sushi \"regular\" resturant!"}
{"text":"Top notch. Would probably be our favorite place i we lived closer. 

Creative, fresh food. Some serious fresh wasabi.

The owner/chef is a true salt-of-the-earth wonderful guy. He's a delightful and engaging person. 

I had my first ever handroll here, as a free gift from the chef. It was on off-menu creation that has become a favorite I can order anywhere I travel. 

Sushi Kee regularly has varieties of fish that I don't normally find in restaurants, and they are knowledgeable about them. The specials are not the same thing over and over, and seem to offer a good value.

Truly an exemplary restaurant."}
{"text":"Meh. Same price as most sushi places in the area, not much to say about quality. Got the Mongolian onion (or at least that's what they should call it). Huge bowl of onions with a few random pieces of beef that I found after looking diligently. Also had California, murray's, and salmon rolls. The rolls were not anything amazing. Likely won't return."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and fresh fish!  We had a great time and the sushi chef was kind enough to  make a yellowfin salad to try while we were eating.  I tried only the tuna, halibut and salmon but all three where fresh and tasty.  Top it off with a tab that would have been doubled at a place like Ra or Kona, while getting lesser product.  Thank you, Sushi Kee and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I meet up with some friends who live near this place, and they had been here a few times and had fool luck. They live closer to Zushi, which is owned by the same person, but they found the selection better at Sushi Kee. We got there at 5pm before the dinner rush started, which was wise. We order 5 rolls, a Tiger eye, and the sushi sampler plater. All of it was delicious. The one new thing I got to try here was fresh wasabi, and WOW was that good. It's not anything like the powdered stuff you get at most places. The only down side to was my wife had ordered a seaweed salad that they forgot to bring her. By the time we found out they had forgotten it she was full already, so it got cancelled. 

My buddy and myself wanted to split another roll, but since the restaurant had filled up while we were eating they told us it would be a half an hour wait for another roll, so we skipped it. That was a little disappointing, but when you only have one sushi chef and 10 tables of people that's going to happen. My suggestion is get there early.

I was pleased to learn that there is a Sushi Knee only about 5 miles from our house in Chandler, so we'll be trying them next. I may even go over for lunch next week."}
{"text":"This place is mine and my best friends favorite! The lady that is always working does so much at once and takes care of guests. The sushi and service is great!"}
{"text":"This is a family favorite place. We found that the sushi here is some of the best in the entire valley, with a much more reasonable price. Definitely better than places like Ra, is more authentic, and reasonably priced. We love the Hawaiian roll, and I've always found the staff very friendly"}
{"text":"Best tuna poke ever.  

Let that sink in.

Don't let the strip mall location or hole in the wall atmosphere fool you, this place is legit."}
{"text":"I am a sushi fanatic so I enjoy trying out different sushi places around the valley. I did a pick-up order and had the shrimp tempura roll and the California roll. The shrimp tempura roll was huge! And delicious! Both of them were. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was a great 1st experience at this sushi restaurant.  All of the sushi exceeded my expectations.  I will definitely be back for more. The Murphy roll is a must!!"}
{"text":"ya I'm still a fan of the food and ambiance service is good well very efficient they could be a little friendlier but today the music was so loud i had to wonder why?????"}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite sushi places!  The food is ALWAYS amazing!!! It feels like they care about the food they provide.  Showed up a little late tonight, and they still delivered!!  Highly recommend trying this place out, then returning again and again!! Photos are from various visits."}
{"text":"been going to Kee for years and it is always great quality and nice friendly service.  the sushi portions are exceptional and great selection of rolls.  I particularly like the salmon skin hand rolls and the seaweed salad...soooo tasty!  Nice selection of beers too."}
{"text":"Great sushi, but they close at 2pm, so kinda inconvenient for those late lunches."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan! The rolls are a big and the fish is fresh...true to their motto of \"big and fresh\". I didn't give it 5 stars because the service was less than average. But the food and atmosphere are awesome. I am so glad that I gave this \"hole in the wall\" a chance. I've been there 3 times now and still love it!"}
{"text":"We first went to Sushi Kee about 6 years ago when we lived in the area.  It felt like any new sushi place.  We have since been back twice in the past 3 months, recently for my birthday.  

We were there on a Wednesday night, and the place was more dead than the fish that they serve.  We considered the all-you-can-eat deal, but after sharing a few bad experience, we opted to just buy sushi and maki.  

A friend of mine and I each got our own bottle of cold sake (note to Sushi Kee - Hana Awaka is awesome, you need to cary it) and proceeded to slam down some really outstanding sushi.  The 6 of us cleared 8 rolls, soup and salad, and a few pieces of sushi.  

Right as we all were throwing in the towel, the waitress brought over a complementary special, that we called WhatToDoWithLeftoverBits.  It was a lightly fried california roll covered in diced ahi, salmon, cucumber, and a few other items.  SIMPLY AWESOME."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi. I love the murphy n viva vegas rolls. The ladies are really nice. Such a simple side salad is included but it is delish. Soup is good too."}
{"text":"This place has ruined me

Ever since coming here, every other sushi restaurant tastes like crap

I freakin' love this place.  Their salmon is sooooo amazing.  
And make sure to ask for the fresh \"real\" wasabi.  It is AWESOME

Yeah, I'd eat here everyday if I could.  But then I'd be soooo poor."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was excellent! Everything we got was fresh and very good. The rolls are huge and very well made. If you sit at the sushi bar they give you a great little seafood salad for free, it's excellent! It's in a run down little strip mall but don't let that stop you from trying it.

Great place! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was mediocre and the fiod left something to be desired. The tempura shrimp tasted like frozen microwaved. It was soggy, rubbery and limp."}
{"text":"For the price, you really cannot get better sushi. The Nacho Mamma is the trashiest and most delicious it gets.

The staff is always very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Sushi Kee is undeniably the best kept secret in Arizona. Located on east Main St Mesa, Arizona, it offers a small quaint ambiance and a delicious selection of sushi made fresh. 

The Las Vegas Roll is a must try menu item. If you enjoy a cooked sushi roll filled with cream cheese, eel, crab, chopped celery and fresh avocado, this is your sushi my friend. The Las Vegas Roll is complimented with a side of sweet eel sauce which adds to the experience. 

The California Crunch Roll is another favorite for the simplistic factor. It is the original California Roll with crab meat, chopped cucumber and avocado. However, this particular crunch roll is cooked displaying a sprinkled layer of crunch around the edges. It is light, fulfilling and priced appropriate. 

At Sushi Kee you receive large sized sushi rolls at an affordable price. Each menu item is freshly made and the taste is packed with flavor. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is one of your typical hole-in-the-wall type local restaurants.  It's just a small eatery -- not very chic, and not in the best location for foot traffic.  But I consider it to be one of the best Sushi spots in Phoenix.  The service is great, prices are fair, and the food is wonderful.  No frills, just nice fresh sushi!  Try coming in for lunch, to catch their specials."}
{"text":"Hands down.... amazing sushi! couldnt quite see the dim blue sign from the road but something about it called to us and were not disappointed! Ramen is also delicious! Try this place out ASAP!!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. This is the best sushi place in the Phoenix area. They also make a pretty incredible chicken or pork Katsu and the spicy ramen (fairly new to the menu) is awesome."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in an unassuming strip mall!  The happy hour specials are varied and extensive, and happy hour goes until 8:00!  The ramen is amazing, and the fish is very fresh.  At the bar, you can find jars with what can I assume are the regulars' personal chopsticks.  The decor is gorgeous as well.  Another thing that I really like personally Is the fact that when you ask for a Coke, they give you the whole can. And they only charge you two or three dollars for it. Pet peeve of mine is flat soda, which seems to happen a lot at restaurants that pull their soda from the bar.  The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is that I wish there were more options for the types of sushi. Also, a lot of the options seem to be fried or have tempura as a part of them.  It doesn't matter, though - this place is a favorite. Definitely try the jalapeño poppers!"}
{"text":"I've cane here several times over the years and have never been disappointed. It's small, it's intimate, very friendly and welcoming. I've been there for family get togethers and for fun and drinks. This place is suitable for either. What I find remarkable is the prices. I'm a huge sushi fan and find this place on par with even the most expensive in the Valley and elsewhere for that matter. No gimmicks here, it's just a real gem of a sushi place!"}
{"text":"Very good quality fish here.  The owners were very nice and accommodating.  They offered to special order any type of fish I desired.  They also invited me back the following night for some off the menu sushi another customer had special ordered.

They also offer fresh wasabi which you have to try if you have never had it, you wont go back to the fake green horseradish junk they serve elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of coworkers for lunch.  Be warned -- stay away!

The sushi was not good.  They got my order wrong (I ordered the salmon instead of the other fish that they have on their lunch menu) and yet they were adamant that its the same fish!  Okay, the last I checked, salmon has pink flesh and butterfish has white flesh.

Anyway, I felt that the food was mediocre.  The lunch special comes with sui mai which was deep fried and oozed of oil.  Couldn't even taste what was inside.  For $13 for a lunch special with tax and tip, I wouldn't say that I would go back."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time tonight and were very impressed. The food was fantastic! Very quick and polite service. They served us a complimentary salad and soup before our meal. The rolls were a lot bigger than we are used to, so we ordered a bit much. Overall a great experience and we will be back. Everything tasted very good."}
{"text":"Being from California, I am really picky about my sushi... So far Sushi kee has been the best I have had since I have been in Arizona. I tried a few other places and I was very dissapointed. The rolls are always so fresh and SO tasty. They have happy hour prices and different specials every day. They also carry gluten free soy sauce for those who need it.
Two thumbs up ;)"}
{"text":"We ate there yesterday and did the all you can eat sushi. I think I downed about 8 rolls by myself. 10 rolls in all, with soup and salad and 2 teas, 45 bucks. Well worth it! The food is great, the service is fast and friendly. Definitely my favorite sushi place!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Mesa with great people and delicious food.  Go for the Viva Las Vegas, fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Fast service. Very good atmosphere.. will come back. Thanks Sushi Kee. ."}
{"text":"Very quaint and great place for sushi! Forget the big chains and bring your appetite here. The quality and quantity is excellent. For dinner we had a delicious salad and soup to begin with. 

It may be in a strange location but don't let that fool you. The service and food are excellent. I will come back again and again"}
{"text":"Amazing food friendly staff. The California roll and the dragon roll are by far the best on the menu"}
{"text":"Sushi Kee is good but not great. We went in on a Saturday night and the had all you can eat sushi for 25 dollars per person. Of course we had to try that, who can't eat 25 dollars in sushi? Sushi Kee didn't offer a wide of variaty in sushi almost all had eel and really how much eel can someone have? The soup and salad came in a timely manner. The sushi came out a few plates at at time probably because we didn't have enough room on our table. The rolls were good not great. They came apart when trying to pick them up which makes a mess but again they were good. The sushi was well, shall I say good but warm?!  Yes, I said warm that kind of turned my stomach but I figured it was from the rice (I don't know what was going through my mind at that time). I'm not an expert but I eat sushi almost every day and I know a tiny bit about things and even though Sushi Kee has their own way of making and preparing their sushi, I have had better elsewhere. I would NOT say pass on Sushi Kee but instead say go and have good sushi there and have a nice time out with someone.
 
The wait staff was very friendly.

Avarage restaurant with avarage sushi."}
{"text":"This little place just looks like a hole in the wall, and it is.  But the food, Amazing!!  We have been going for a couple years now and the sushi is always great, but just recently tried the calamari appetizer, SO good!  I don't know what the sauce they serve it with is but I think I could drink it straight from the cup.  We LOVE their salad dressing too and always ask for double salad instead of soup!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  The sushi was fresh and really good, the gyoza, soup, salad, and chicken teriyaki were also all delicious!  I can't wait to go back!  We went on a Friday night, so it got pretty busy around 7pm.  I was weary after reading the other reviews, but I'm so glad I didn't listen!  3 couples went, one of which had 2 children, and all 8 of us loved the food we ordered!"}
{"text":"Yum. I was skeptical about the unlimited sushi deal- I figured they would skimp on fish and be heavy on rice but I was proved wrong and have been back again since. Every roll I ordered ( 7 rolls between 2 people ) had large chunks of very fresh fish! It was so good! I love the Las Vegas roll.. Also recommend Arizona, Alaska, and Caterpillar rolls. Both times I've been, the restaurant has been pretty empty but the waitress was helpful both times."}
{"text":"Can I say they have the best sushi in Arizona? I have been to many sushi restaurants but their sushi is ON POINT. They have been open for 15, 16 years now but tonight was our first time here, and I know this wont be the last time. The inside has quite of an authentic japnese feeling to it and it is overall very clean and tidy. We were already pretty full so we just picked a few items from the happy hour. I was super thrilled to find Takoyaki on the menu :D everything was delicious and they do deserve a 5 star rating for the sushi and rolls. Most of all, their fish is of SUPERB quality. My boyfriend ordered two salmon nigiri and he said this is a perfection. We were surprised when we got our food because this level of quality wasn't even expect from us. Kudos for the fresh fish. Great environment, great service and great food."}
{"text":"By far, my favorite sushi place near Ahwatukee (since Sushi Eye left). The happy hour is good, but their menu has so many yummy looking dishes on it that I usually order from that. The Lemon Salmon and the Blossom rolls are my favorites.  However, I also love the Escolar nigiri (which is offered on the Happy hour menu).  The restaurant is super clean and the service is fantastic.

I look forward to the next time I get to visit Sushi Kee."}
{"text":"This is not in a pretty area by any means. It was almost a drive on by type of place. 

That being said......My friend told me to give it a shot. I had several rolls to get a good idea of the place. Spicy tuna, hurricane, Las Vegas, Arizona, and keys. My only beef was with the spicy tuna. Not much flavor and it was in a different type of roll then I am used to. The flavors were very nice on the other rolls. My favorite was the Arizona and hurricane. 

The place was a little dark and warm for my liking, but the service was great and so was the food. Not a bad find in east Mesa. I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The sushi restaurant I frequented several times a month for almost 10 years closed down last year and I have been searching for a replacement. Well I think I have found it. I have been here twice now (first time with my 3 year old & husband and this time by myself) and will come many more times in the future. The fish is very good and fresh which is my main requirement (I eat mostly nigiri). They also have great happy hour pricing (food & drinks) from 5 - 8pm daily. In reading the previous reviews I saw people mention the decor being less than steller and I would agree it is a bit basic and older looking in certain areas but that does not bother me. I have had very prompt service during both visits and excellent food at a great value."}
{"text":"Happy hour during lunch is a great touch, Prices at this time are amazing. Food was fresh and delicious. Service was courteous and fast."}
{"text":"I am a new fan of sushi, in general. So read this review with the understanding that I have limited experience in the sushi realm. 

I loved this place! You are definitely not paying for the ambiance, but I think that actually makes it a better place to go, because the focus is the food, not the location. We arrived shortly after happy hour ended, but with a few pleas and smiles, we were given happy hour rates (with a reminder that next time we would need to pay full price if we were late again). I absolutely love that kind of customer service - especially when I'm the benefactor.

We ordered the Viva Las Vegas, Rainbow, a Hawaiian special, and an other eel roll that I didn't try. We ordered 6 rolls for 4 people and we were all well fed by the end of our dinner. 

Our waitress was MIA for most of the night. We finally had to hail down another waitress and request our check. Still...I'm definitely a fan of Sushi Kee's delicious sushi rolls and look forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"I was taken to sushi kee by my boyfriend's parents, and I have to say it was a pretty nice place! It was super packed when we went, but everything was still brought to us fairly quickly. The sushi was pretty good - specifically the tofu and veggie pieces. Their Red Mountain Roll is also enjoyable. It's a pretty small venue, but it's nice for it's size, and worth what you pay. Give it a try if you're in the area, but I'm sure there are even more over-the-top amazing sushi places out there somewhere."}
{"text":"Sushi is slightly above average at best. Interior Design is very dated and in need of a complete deep cleaning. We made the mistake of sending an item back because it was not as advertised. Got major attitude from the owners waitress. The complimentary soup and salad are very basic and no effort goes into the preparation. May not return"}
{"text":"Been going since 2011!
Every single visit its the same order: red mountain, not deep fried...ALWAYS PERFECT 
If you are wanting good sushi go here.
Its not a fancy date night setting but its great food."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service and good, but not great, sushi.

Sushi Kee isn't located in an area where you'd typically think of a decent sushi restaurant being located. But I went inside because of the decent ratings here on Yelp, and I am happy I did so. The interior of the restaurant is nothing spectacular, but it has a decent number of tables and seating area at the sushi bar. As I was there by myself, I sat at the bar.

The restaurant wasn't too full, but I got attention from no less than 3 employees while I was eating. My water was always full and my sushi orders were quickly taken and processed, all with a smile.

As for the food itself, I was impressed with the variety of options on the menu. There are a number of traditional sushi options as far as the nigiri, sashimi, and rolls go. There are also a few more unique roll options with local names (like Apache and Arizona) and some rolls that are made with cucumber rather than with rice.

I tried a couple of those unique rolls--the Apache and the Crazy Lobster, I believe. Both were pretty solid. The Crazy Lobster is one of the cucumber rolls--I rather enjoyed the break from the traditional rice roll. For anybody who cares, it's a good way to have your sushi be even less carb intensive. And the Apache was also pretty good. It is baked and has a spicy sauce on it, so it provides some warmth that other sushi rolls might not for a cool evening.

Finally, I ended my meal with a \"dessert\" order: the unagi nigiri. This order of eel has a nice, sweet sauce to it that really does make for a nice finisher for a sushi meal. Sushi Kee's version of the unagi was a little heavy on the sauce for my liking, but it was nonetheless pretty tasty.

As the local, seemingly best option for sushi, I'm sure that I'll be back."}
{"text":"We were tired of our regular sushi places so I sought after something new. This location had plenty of reviews to decide to venture out of our comfort zone. 

We tried the jalapeño poppers and they were amazing. All of the sushi rolls we ordered (Las Vegas, Phoenix, and shrimp tempura) were prepared very well. 

The only complaint I had was how long it took for our order to come out. After looking back on our experience, I've settled with \"you can't rush perfection.\""}
{"text":"As always trying out lots of different places around the valley.  I had heard good things about Sushi Kee so we went for lunch.
I had the \"Mesa\" roll.  The Jalepeno was simply an uncooked piece sliced from a raw, whole Jalepeno.  To hot, too crisp, to wrong.  My friend had the \"Murphy Roll\" which had cream cheese, some yellow thing we could not identify (egg) avacado and crab meat.  The fish was practically non-existant and the roll (although pretty) was generally tasteless.  The shrimp tempura was undercooked.  With no alcohol and only one soft drink our lunch was 29$ which to me is far too expensive for a small restaurant in a bad part of town.  For the same money I could have lunch at RA.  I wasn't grossed out or excited by the place. It was simply OK but I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Arizona. This is one of those hole-in-the-wall places. If you are looking for amazing ambiance, you won't find it here, but excellent food you will. Have never had anything I didn't like here with either the rolls, or sashimi. The food is fresh and full of flavor. Some of my favorites items here are the Baked Green Mussels, Spicy Scallops, Salmon sashimi, and Las Vegas Roll. Prices are really reasonable. If you've never had fresh wasabi, give it a try, it's now a must everytime I go somewhere."}
{"text":"Let's face it.  I am a white girl who likes sushi.  A lot.  So, I jumped at the chance to try my co-worker's Favorite Sushi Place Ever.  I am always on the lookout for the next great raw fish opportunity!

I have to sum up the experience by saying it was so-so.  Some items were really great, and others not so much.  My favorite thing was definitely the Kee Roll - spicy tuna and salmon inside topped with generous cuts of tuna and salmon as well as very thin slices of lemon.  Great!  The butterfish was also very good.  BUT... what can make a sushi meal go downhill fast?  The albacore and yellowtail both tasted somewhat \"fishy\" and didn't appear to be sliced properly.  Automatic deductions in my book.  Yes, I am the Sushi Judge.

The service was so-so as well.  While the dishes came quickly, it was rather difficult to flag someone down to order more drinks.  Hey, spicy rolls require beers quickly, people!!

So, while the food was mostly good, all things considered I still think there are better fish in the sea."}
{"text":"I'm amazed that people think the portions are small because I felt they were extremely generous. 
The partner ordered the chicken katsu, which came with a large portion of the chicken over a lot of rice and salad.  The chicken was nice and crispy and the sauce was packed with flavor.  I liked the acidic sweetness to the sauce. 
I ordered the squid salad, chef's special sashimi and kee's roll.  Squid salad is one of my favorite salads, I love the vinegar and crunch.  Sushi Kee did a great job on fulfilling my craving.  
Of the sashimi, my favorite was the salmon with mango.  The salmon was super fresh and melted like butter and the mango complimented it surprisingly well.  I also loved the consistency and cut to the sashimi and sushi.  It was easy to eat, fresh, and delicious. 
We got to Sushi Kee just as it was opening and had terrific service.  They were accommodating and friendly.  The partner and I believe we've found our new local sushi joint and are excited to try out everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, amazing service! You wouldn't think of stopping at this place to eat just by the sketchy looking parking lot but give it a try because it's really great! My boyfriend said it is at the top of his list for favorite spots for sushi and he is extremely picky!"}
{"text":"Consistently great sushi! They advertise \"big and fresh\" and that's exactly what you get! Happy Hour is from 11AM-6:30PM, and lunch is served until 4PM. The only difference between lunch and dinner, is that you get a free salad and cup of Miso with lunch. They honestly underprice all of their food. My boss and I went in and paid $35 for 3 Specialty Rolls and 3 orders of Sashimi. *you can print a coupon off of their website for 20% off your meal!"}
{"text":"Huge Portions and the food is great. i have gone to eat here at least 10 times in the past two years and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant along power rd. I have not experienced the sashimi yet unfortunately but have not been disappointed in the rolls. I had the rainbow roll there the last time and the fish was all very good. They bring you miso and salad with anything you order which is nice while you are waiting. It is a very small order place but definitely check it out for the food!"}
{"text":"The place is small and not very busy on Monday nights, with that said the service was bad. one server, 3 tables of two people each and it still took her 10 mins to get my drink order.
But to get that over with I was extremely happy with the food! Tasted and looked super fresh, the portions are big and the location is great. I've always loved small places like this, they have the best sushi. 
For sure will go again, but with more patience."}
{"text":"Best sushi place on the east valley! Happy hour is unbeatable and just awesome!! Been here several times, I've even taken my friends and family and they all love it! The place is kind of small, so wouldn't be ideal for big groups, but the sushi is soooo fresh, its totally worth giving a try! Also, excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Flew into Mesa -Gateway airport yesterday and first stop per my boyfriend was Sushi Kee - a favorite spot when he lived here - did not disappoint! The baked mussels are AMAZING - they should have more description on the menu as I think most folks are missing out on these crab topped delights! Also enjoyed the crazy lobster roll with cucumber wrap and the squid salad! Happy hour prices at lunch :)"}
{"text":"Top notch sushi at an amazing price. I eat here at least once a month. It looks like a whole in the wall, but don't be fooled. It has fantastic sushi, and the house salad with ginger dressing is really good."}
{"text":"First time here... definitely not the last. The miso soup is yummy. The iced green tea is perfect and I ordered the jalapeño popper appetizer and I was VERY impressed.  Next time I am trying their sushi rolls for sure. 
They have a very good variety of dishes and the presentation is impeccable. 
Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Talk about hidden gem. The exterior is meh, but inside you just know it's going to be great. The service is ridiculously fast (we got our sashimi and rolls before we got our edamame). The price is great. They basically have happy hour all the time. This place fills up fast because inside is small and intimate."}
{"text":"Mrs.Seinfeld...PLEASE TURN ON THE AC! Sushi real nice,happy hour is great.Floor fans,not so much."}
{"text":"Set in a nondescript strip mall on Power & Main, you would be forgiven for easily dismissing this place. Besides, sushi might not be on the mind of your average Big Lots bargain hunter. We took a chance only after passing it for the umpteenth time, hoping for something better than our usually east side sushi/teppanyaki joint. 

Saying it was a pleasant surprise is an understatement.  The place is cozy and clean inside, staff is friendly and service is quick. The menu is quite varied, but we stuck to the sushi. Lots of unique rolls, but we chose the Power roll that is an inside out tempura shrimp roll with eel on the outside, very tasty, Negi-Hama which for once wasn't inside out but was still nice, lobster salad hand roll and some Hamachi and tuna sashimi. Everything was fresh and well presented. 

Note that before 6:30 you get happy hour pricing, but after that you. An use their 10% off coupon from their website. 

One last thing. The portion sizes are huge, they actually have a regular and large selection for sashimi but even the regular was massive. And the lobster hand roll? Big as an actual hand!!"}
{"text":"I'm bittersweet about this sushi joint. Why? Because I'm a big fan of it. However, my sushi eating partner in crime did not have a good experience at all and could barely finish hers. 

I've been to this plaza several times and it didn't hit me until this visit that Sushi Kee was right there. All this time. We drove over on a whim to check it out as we both agreed we wanted to try a new sushi place. 

After deciding on some takeout items, we walked around the plaza for a bit while we waited. Upon returning, I was told one of my nigiri orders wasn't able to be completed. By the sushi chef himself. I gave them my second choice and to my surprise my order came with an extra order of nigiri at no charge. :) Happy face.

All in all it won't be my new go to place.. it's no Sushi Time. However, I guess if I'm going by myself, I can easily swing by this place. 

One bonus is they have an all you can eat sushi bar too :)"}
{"text":"OK...I LOVE, LOVE sushi. Its my favorite food period. I've been eating it since i was 12 and I've been all over. Some signs to look for in a sushi bar:
Japanese owned and operated - more sushi places are not
largely Asian clientele: if you see Japanese families there, you know its good
good uni - uni doesn't keep well. good uni means fresh fish and fresh means good.

Sushi Kee meets all 3 criteria. Kee (the namesake) works behind the sushi bar and his wife is the hostess and sometime waitress. At night there are lots of Japanese families there. And the Uni....they make it right. Another good sign, the mama-san effect. In Japan, the sushi bars you frequent make you feel like family. They remember you, your drink, your favorite foods, they honor you with free food for being a loyal patron. I cant count how many times I've received free rolls from Kee for just showing up. They know me as Mr Arnold Palmer (my favorite drink).

Add to this they started offering all you can eat sushi for $20 (usually a bad sign) which is a deal if you can eat 3 rolls. This place is heaven for the sushi lover. Recommended rolls: 
Butterfly - butter fish and shrimp with paper thin slices of lemon
Lemon - salmon covered cali roll with paper thin lemon
Snow roll - extra yummy butter fish roll (butter fish is all white and has the consistency of well...cold butter)
Shrimp lovers roll - soy paper wrapped around tempura shrimp topped with shrimp.
Phoenix roll - deep fried spicy salmon roll. each piece is a mouthful but if you like deep fried rolls this is the best

This place has also rec'd rave reviews in the city paper, they've been in business for at least 10 years, and whats more, everyone I take there is impressed and becomes a repeat customer. I just wish I lived closer.

The only negative: They don't take American Express"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for almost six years now. We've been here even before they decided to expand the inside of their restaurant. This has always been a go-to for us when we want some great service and wonderful sushi! Try out the sashimi and nigiri platters they offer, or if you prefer something more poultry based - try the chicken teriyaki! Either way, you'll enjoy the food and experience."}
{"text":"I have to update my review.  My boyfriend and I went here the other night for dinner.  I was SO excited since I hadn't eaten here in awhile.  He ordered the mongolian beef and I got my favorite Crunchy roll.  His food came out 15 minutes before mine did, so he let me pick at it until my roll was done.  My roll was still good, but the chef was super heavy handed on the eel sauce so it was a bit of a sticky mess.  The place was super crowded and the waitress kept bumping into his chair.  When we finally finished eating it took 30 minutes to get our check.  Overall I was super disappointed in our visit there.  Not sure that we will be dining in again anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi joint in the Valley. The staff is great & always remember my family - my mom & I even have our own dedicated chopsticks that they pull for our table when we arrive. Business seems to be picking up which is awesome, but the wait can be a little long during dinner time even mid-week. The Mesa roll is my go-to, but everything is delicious, beautifully presented, reasonably priced & always fresh. Can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"I've been eating sushi for 10 years and always disliked it but everyone else loved it.. But after eating here.. I've grown a new taste for the art of sushi. This place is amazing! So authentic they barely speak English and it shows in there food. Just imagine eating in Japan on your lunch break at a real spot. Don't delay, hit sushi kee today!"}
{"text":"They don't offer the all you can eat deal anymore. My husband and I had stopped by because we wanted to try a new sushi spot. It wasn't that busy but after waiting 45 minutes for 2 rolls, our patience ran out and we left. The staff seems nice and the rolls looked good, but I wouldn't be able to tell you how it tasted."}
{"text":"Great first experience. The house salad has a yummy ginger dressing. The service was quick and friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have heard wonderful things about Sushi Kee for some time now. We finally made our way in and we were not disappointed. We ordered the edamame, shrimp tempura and the murphy roll. All items were very flavorful and something we would order again."}
{"text":"Sushi: I only like their Salmon nigiri. I did not like tuna, ika, and yellowtail nigiri. I would only go during happy hour for the sushi. 

Spicy Ramen: I would appreciate if owner states the ramen is \"Korean Package Ramen\". I was assuming the ramen is Japanese Ramen but it was a package ramen. I was able to taste the instant soup... I directly asked a server, and she informed me that it is a package ramen. For $8, if I knew it was a instant package ramen, I would just cook by myself... It will be good to inform customer that the ramen is a instant noodle.. Also... portion was too small"}
{"text":"So I'm a full fledged sushi lover and will travel many miles for good sushi. This is good sushi. The all you can eat is no joke. The VOLCANO Roll was out of this world. Also the sake bombers are great too. 

Please do not go to Ra this place is ten times better, with better service, less people, and no loud music."}
{"text":"If you are gluten free, DO NOT eat here!  I ordered sushi and their gluten free soy sauce, for which they were charging me an extra dollar.  The server brought me a small plastic container of soy sauce, but no bottle (weird).  Since I have celiac and absolutely cannot have gluten, I asked him to please bring me the bottle so that I could see and make sure it was gluten free.  He brought me the bottle and it was NOT gluten free!!  Wheat was listed clearly in the list of ingredients and the bottle didn't even say that it was gluten free. Thank goodness I checked!  When I brought this to the chef's attention, he didn't seem to care at all.  I had to drive to the grocery store and return with my own bottle of GF soy sauce just to eat the sushi I had ordered. This experience, along with the fact that the sushi was very mediocre, means we'll never return."}
{"text":"Pretty decent sushi for a place in east Mesa. It's in a weird location by Big Lots, a tailor, Dollar Store and more but don't let that stop you from going. I had several of the rolls and they are all good and the prices decent as well. The saki I had wasn't that great and was the cheap kind that tastes like peroxide but they might have better stock."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here! If you are an albacore sushi lover like I am you will love it here! The sear on the albacore is like nothing Ive ever tasted. I usually ask for no sear on my albacore because it usually tastes like butane. There is a flavor in the sear that works extremely well with their fresh and yummy albacore. Another favorite of my family's are the stuffed jalepenos and stuffed shrimp appetizers... We always get them! If you are into cut rolls then you will be in sushi heaven here. Every roll we have ever had here we wanted to order another. The portions are perfect and prices reasonable especially for the quality and caliber of sushi you get here. The service is always on point. Friendly, informative, well-manored, and personable. If you make Sushi Kee your go to sushi place and become a regular they let you pick out your own chop sticks and keep them in your own personalized container for you. Very clean place too!"}
{"text":"Not to be confused with the Sushi Kee in Mesa, this is a much better place in my sushi opinion. If you like albacore sushi you will LOVE it after trying it here. They sear it without a torch but in a way that adds another dimension to albacore sushi. I can never have enough. All the rolls are exceptional, perfectly portioned, and very fresh and inventive. Great service, friendly staff, very informed. If you are a sushi foodie you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Usually our go to spot, but not sure what happened on our last trip, they weren't firing at 100%.  It's a great hole in the wall spot with high quality product and great flavors.  I will typically get an entree dish and a sushi roll, while my wife goes for the sashimi.  Definitely a good variety of choices for everyone.  I recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"First time at Sushi Kee.  Really good sushi but the pieces are HUGE... Had to cut them down. We like the fact that they have fresh Wasabi.  
Overall experience was good! Will go again!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night for all you can eat sushi for only $19.95.  It was packed!  Always a good sign...

Ordered 4 rolls and 2 nigiri rolls.  Everything was pretty good.  I wish we could have ordered more sushi, but we finished everything and were stuffed!  

Now I feel fat.  Thanks Sushi Kee!"}
{"text":"The all-you-can-eat for $20 is a good deal - you get your money's worth after just 2 cherry blossom rolls which are very good!

My husband insists that this is the best, freshest sushi in the area. Tuna is my favorite, but it is always very stringy here and impossible to bite into... I get much better tuna nigiri sushi at Ra - which my husband insists has the worst sushi in the area. :)~ The other nigiri sushi at sushi kee is pretty good and most of it is not usually too stringy. The butterfish is my favorite. I wish they had better tuna!"}
{"text":"Try the fried calamari for your appetizer and the tuna poke for your entrée yum!

Things to try here. .. The Murphy Roll,  the Lucky Roll, and the Mesa Roll, Apache Roll

we've been coming here for 6 years. we love it. I've never had a bad meal here. while its hard to find good sushi here in the desert, this place is a refreshing place to get your sushi fix"}
{"text":"We have been going to Sushi Kee for several years now and continue to believe that it is the best sushi in the East Valley. The sushi is always fresh and delicious.  If you are lucky enough to go when Kee has ankimo, you are in for a real treat...  some of the best I've ever had.  The rolls are all fairly standard on the menu, but don't be afraid to ask Kee to make you something special.  We are regularly surprised by something different and delicious.

We take our three daughters with us and get them honey chicken or katsu; not something I would ever order, but they always like it. 

I do wish Kee would get some fish back into the tank behind the bar though...  it does make for a sad backdrop to such a yummy dinner."}
{"text":"Really good!  Had Viva Vegas, Murphy Roll and Hurricane Rolls.  Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"The sushi is AMAZING!!! My bf and I tried the Las Vegas roll, Surf & Turf roll, Phoenix roll, spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and Philly roll. We also shared a chicken teriyaki bowl. (Yes we were starving!) The service was great, we went around 11:30 and there were a couple people in here, but our server checked in on us several times and never skipped a beat on refilling pur water. This place is definitely a great find!"}
{"text":"Hmmm. . .

Sorry to break the five-star streak that this place has, but we just couldn't give it any higher of a rating.

The food tasted good--nice and fresh, but. . .you just don't get enough.  At other, similar places, when you order a chicken teriyaki, you get about one third to one half more food.  The teriyaki entree here was SMALL, served on a big plate, and given a full price.  Even with six gyoza, I was still hungry by the time the bill came.

My family had a similar experience as I did.  I don't want to be insulting to the chef--the food was artfully made and the presentation was as nice as the taste.  The ambiance is beautiful, and service was a bit slow, but thorough and friendly.  You will certainly like or even love the food if you come here, but you will like it better if you have a small appetite.

If you are looking for a more filling meal, I think that you will find that the delicious taste of Sushi Kee will only take you so far for your dollar.  I know why this place gets rave reviews--just that we would like a little more quantity to go along with the quality."}
{"text":"Driving around Tempe looking for a sushi place. Our normal spot was closed because of the July 4th weekend. So Sushi Kee your it tonight. 

Walking in and the place is really cool. Upside down Japanese umbrellas, Japanese fish painting, bamboo, and all sort of different Japanese art to decorate. Very nice with pop music playing. Pretty inviting and nice atmosphere. 

We started out with their miso soup. Pretty good. Not bad but I've tastes better. We ordered the rainbow, caterpillar, red dragon, and blossom rolls. Fresh and good sushi. Very good. My favorite was the Red Rainbow. Nice little kick to it. Yum yum good. We could have ordered more rolls. It was that good. 

I ordered the seafood Yaki soba. It had lots of shrimp and scallops with grilled onions and lots of other vegetables. Very good and lots of it. Really enjoyed it even through I'm not a fan of grilled onions. Yum yum good. 

My wife had the chicken teriyaki and it was so juicy and tasty. They didn't give that much but it was really good. My son ordered the beef teriyaki and I was able to steal a few pieces of beef.  It was a little peppery and thick pieces of beef. A little chewy but good. Not great but pretty good.   

Service was pretty good. Filled our cups on a regular basis, took our order on time, and brought our food in a reasonable time. So overall, good food, good service, and really good sushi. What more can a guy ask for. Yum yum good. I'll be back so enjoy."}
{"text":"Best spot in town. Sushi is always consistent and fresh. Service is mostly great on busy nights it can be a bit slow and crowded. Prices are fair and big portions. My husband and I have been coming almost every week for years. We try other places but none come close so we always end up back! Favs jalapeño popper and lucky roll!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is good , Always get cheaper rolls. I like the Vegas and Califorina. Only down side is they close 4 hours out of the day. So thats a bummer. Sushi is sometimes out of this world and other times just ok. It depends who is working .All and all its a soild 4 stars."}
{"text":"Their Salmon Nigiri tastes so fresh and amazing! I've been to Sugarfish in Santa Monica and did NOT expect this to taste like the salmon nigiri I had there but it did and I was in heaven. Would definitely recommend. We went for happy hour and got spicy tuna and California rolls also, which were great. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Good sushi, decent price. I wish the happy hour menu had more rolls on it. I haven't been disappointed here."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices, good service, and VERY generous portions!! I will definitely frequent Sushi Kee as should all. :)"}
{"text":"Ate here for the second time last night. I love the happy hour menu, it includes Sashimi and Sake. When we walked in there was a terrible smell (why I'm giving 4 stars) near the front door. They sat us at a table nearby and the smell was all I could think about. After requesting to move tables the smell was less pungent and I felt I would be able to eat. We ordered all happy hour food and we very happy with the taste and freshness of the food. That smell tho...hope they can pin it down and fix it, because it's gonna be an issue."}
{"text":"Great little find, small place, great lunch prices, all day happy hour and friendly staff. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here many many times. I always say I'm gonna try somewhere different but I always end up at Sushi Kee! Love the rolls her especially red dragon and viva Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is good small but good the staff is very friendly  and know a lot about all the menu items so if you have any questions about the food  they can help. the price is right to the happy hour could be better  but the food is allays fresh the tea is good  the volcano is some thing every one should try. love this place"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Friendly staff. I wish they had a better location. I have gone there on special occasions and have never been disappointed. Great food. Good people"}
{"text":"Eureka!  I think this is it..  Finally GREAT raw fish in the Phx area. Sushi Kee is a small neighborhood sushi bar with quality fish, portions to wow and prices that make you think twice about stopping by the market on your way home from work.   Use Omega 3  fatty acids as your justification.  The first time you go you will over order if you do your usual checklist.  The slabs of fish are about 6 inches long, more than an inch wide teetering on a bit of rice,  deliciously fresh.   I folded mine like a pizza sandwich and attempted the all in one bite, not a chance.   My favorite this night was the salmon - great fat content with that butter consistency.   If salmon isn't fresh, no amount of wasabe and soy can mask it,  this was perfection.

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First of all, the restaurant looks like it's located in an Auto Plaza, I drove passed it when I was looking for it because I wasn't expecting it to be there. I was overwhelmed with a sewage-smell upon walking in and the smell lingered the entire time I was there. They made the wrong sushi roll for my husband so he had to wait an additional 10 minutes for his food. He ended up not even liking the sushi and only ate a few bites. I thought my food was okay. The miso soup was pretty good. I thought the decor was cute as well. However, the waitress could learn to smile. She did not seem very happy to be there. Overall, it was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Food was excellent for dinner. We ordered a variety of rolls along with Spicy Ramen soup. All of which were delicious!! Service was also excellent and attentive. Certainly would return again!"}
{"text":"So after reading the reviews I thought I would give this place a shot since I live about ten minutes away. I am sorry to say I was deeply disappointed. This place is mediocre at best. I could not add enough soy sauce and wasabi to make up for  what was lacking in flavor. Even the edamame was so so and that is hard to screw up. The only thing that caught my attention was the very large portions of sashimi. The rolls were flavorless and they fell apart as soon as you picked them up. I felt like I betrayed my usual sushi spot ( Masa Sushi Gilbert, AZ) and I will never do that again. I will never again go here and I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Sushi restaurants and I eat a lot of sushi. 

About the fish:
- The fish is mostly fresh but not always so try a few things before deciding on a big order.
- Big Eye tuna isn't tasty. They sometimes have Blue Fin.
- The Salmon is of high grade and I almost never get a bad cut (if you ever ate salmon at Ra, you'd know what a bad cut is).
- The types of fresh fish can change and sometimes they have delightful new additions.

About the cooking:
- The rice is always cooked right and doesn't taste like Vinegar.
- Rice is warm and fish is cold which is the way to get the most out of sushi.
- Fresh chopped wasabi is added on request. If you eat sushi with fresh wasabi, you'll never be able to eat it without. The green horseradish that most places serve doesn't even taste similar.

About the drinks:
- Good selection of cold sake.
- It's not the place for sake bombers.

About the service:
- The waiting service in this place is pretty bad. Drinks are rarely refilled.
- The chef is pleasant to talk to and very professional.
- Soup and salad comes included with every meal.
- Sometimes the chef lets me try new items on the house.
- This restaurant doesn't take American Express but don't let that deter you because you'd be missing out on the great food.
- All you can eat Sushi Saturday nights is pretty good.

About the rolls:
- Not a big fan of rolls myself but they are tasty. The kee roll with spicy tuna is my favorite and the lobster roll is very special.

About the to go service:
- You call this place and they won't tell you who they are. You have to ask specifically if it's sushi Kee. So strange...."}
{"text":"I had the Shashimi combo. The sushi is fresh. The salad and miso soup was great. The value and quality are in line."}
{"text":"We love the sushi here! It is very good and fresh. The workers are super nice and attentive. We ordered the Dragon roll, the Mesa roll, gyozas, smoked salmon and lobster nigiri! It was delicious! Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I don't want to jinx it. But this place is my new fav sushi spot! I cannot believe it took us so long to discover this great find. They have great pricing and very good quality sushi. We have gone four times in less than 2 weeks! I love how they have a variety of different rolls and a lot of sushi options without rice. Service could be better with refills. But it's still delicious and I Can't wait to go back again. 


Update:
Well. Sad to say it but another one bites the dust!! We went to our fav sushi place for dinner and it was just disappointing. I ordered a sashimi platter because I didn't want rice. Instead I received room temp bone dry fish on warm rice...the baked salmon roll I typically get had way too much sweet sauce making it hard to eat. Then the spicy scallops were drenched in Sriracha and had a funky after taste. Awful. Time to look for a new sushi spot."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for the first time with Emma, and 2 of our best friends after a Superstition Mountain hike. The 4 of us have enjoyed sushi together at multiple locations between Mesa and Los Angeles. One ongoing competition between us is finding the best sushi spot in AZ. I could not give Sushi Kee 5 stars because it is not the best sushi I have had. A few Cali spots I have checked out just cannot be beat in my opinion. As far as AZ sushi however, I think Sushi Kee takes the cake. All 4 of us left here completely satisfied. Prices were right. Portions were generous. Atmosphere was comfortable. Fish was fresh. If you are into sushi joints where screaming at your friends is necessary in order to carry out a conversation because top 40 is blaring through speakers overhead.. ahhem Glue-Raw-Sabi..then Sushi Kee is not for you."}
{"text":"The sushi here is super super good! Always fast & friendly service. The prices are great too! The only thing I can hope for is that they add sushi burritos to the menu"}
{"text":"wwewelwell there was a lot of curiousity building for this place. A LOL on the expensive side but average for a high end sushi place. The Los Vegas roll was awesome the Murphy roll was pretty good too. The fresh water eel was simply amazing. Prolly be back so far seems like best sushi in this desert state. For two rolls the eel and drink it was $23."}
{"text":"The sushi here is definitely above average, and very fresh from what i had.  They also have fresh wasabi (Not the food colored horse radish paste); which for me is a huge plus at a sushi place.  

My only qualm comes from their roll selection, and 90% of their rolls including imitation crab meat.  It isn't a terrible ingredient, but it should not be in nearly every roll.  What really brought this place up to 4 stars for me though was their service.  Drinks were always filled, people were friendly, and the sushi was made and served as quickly as we could eat it."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour; Great sushi place! Will definitely be back for more sushi! Amazing prices for happy hours and had great service!"}
{"text":"Yikes, I give this place 2 stars. Sushi rolls were ok but not rolled tight and fell apart when I picked them up. The Tempura was awful. Soggy, not crispy at all and not made correctly. I use to be a Tempura Chef at the beginning of my Chef career and could have gone back and made it WAY better myself. The shrimp was lymph and the 2 asparagus still had the inedible ends on them. I sent it back to be redone but it was barely much better.The Miso was questionable as the color was strange. There was so much dressing on my salad there was a pool in the bottom of the bowl. I thought the place needed an update desperately as well as a good cleaning. It is probably a popular lunch place for nearby business like Boeing."}
{"text":"Second time in 17 years I have ever sent sushi back at a sushi bar was here.

I should have known going to a Sushi bar so close to Apache Junction was a bad idea.  First, the prices are low and pieces are huge.  Too big actually.  The proportions are all off and like stated before, makes you seriously wonder how they can sell such large quantity for so cheap.  

Well, I guess by serving less-than-fresh fish.  I ordered Albacore sashimi and took one bite, spit it out, and sent it back.... the fish was BAD.  The chef actually took a piece, ate it, and tried to tell me nothing was wrong with it and that perhaps it was the pungent sauce!  Wtf?"}
{"text":"I have been coming here over 7 years and it never disappoints.  The staff is amazing and food is always fresh. The prices are about the same as other places but the happy hour is the time to come. The saving are amazing during happy hour and if i have ever had a problem, they go above and beyond to fix it. I love how some of the rolls have a local theme, nice touch!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately after trying bad sushi joints and yes they include all you can eat sushi places I thought that I couldn't eat worse. Well how wrong was my take on that. The absolute no no in sushi is when the raw food isn't fresh. A good thumb rule is if the seafood smells more than usual its probably old. Well that's exactly what I got here. 

The service was good. BTW they expect you to spend a minimum of $20"}
{"text":"My 8th time in Sushi Kee. and thus the rating reflects an average rating. It has been a hit or miss based primarily on whether I sat at the sushi bar or not. In the times I did, the experience was positive , however for the times I was on the normal dinner/lunch tables the experience and food was lacking. The review is primarily to state that the menu they have on the yelp site is utterly wrong.

I went in trying to order the Ochazuke which shows up on the full menu link.However neither the waitress nor the part owner knew anything about this even though Yelp claims that only the owner can populate these details. So instead I ordered the Udon with Tempura. The mess that was given to me was made up of packaged broths with packed fried onions as garnish and packaged udon noodles. I could barely swallow half even though I was famished"}
{"text":"This is hands down my fave sushi place in Az it's a small humble place that boasts amazing service and delicious sushi! You can come on a date night or bring the kiddies it's all good! The Kee Roll is my favorite roll but they are all amazing! This is deff the place you go for a good meal and a nice sake or soju!! Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"I love Sushi Kee!  Make sure to ask for the fresh wasabi...you'll never go back to the green paste again.  The murphy roll is a classic...hot, bubbly, cheesy...a surprising roll.  The Red Mountain roll is huge--spicy, and a meal all by its self.  Their sashimi is great.  The octopus sashimi is my favorite!  It is served with paper thin slices of lemon which are the perfect compliment to the octopus.  The Hawaiian roll was amazing! It has a sweet kiwi sauce that is insanely good.  Whether you do rolls or sashimi, you can't go wrong at Sushi Kee."}
{"text":"I ordered the $11.99 Sashimi lunch today and was really disappointed with what I got. It's supposed to come with 12 pieces of sashimi, but the problem is that most of it was what I'd consider 1/2 size pieces, really tiny. It came with miso soup which was nice and hot, but no rice? I think this is the first time I've ordered a sashimi meal and didn't get rice to go with it. 

The single piece of salmon was very lean (no fat) missing that lovely creamy taste that I enjoy so much. And I don't remember any yellow tail on there at all. 

Maybe the other lunch specials are better, but this deal was horrible. Left hungry and felt cheated by the small portion size."}
{"text":"Very very good!  The sushi here is top notch, which is certainly more than I expected from landlocked East Mesa.  The lunch combination special comes with 8 pieces of sushi which most likely vary.  On the day I tried it, I got clam, white fish, tuna, salmon and other good stuff; yum!  Before we even placed our order, the server brought us each a piping hot tasty bowl of miso soup!  I would definitely come here again for a lunch break or a dinner after a day of Salt River tubing!"}
{"text":"The food is good but I can't even get through to talk to someone. I've been calling for 20 minutes and the line has been busy ever since. That is annoying. I don't think I'll be picking up my sushi from here anymore."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi in the valley. It's only $20 but you can get any sushi on the menu (excluding only the raw Sashimi).

I haven't tried all of the specialty rolls yet but so far the ones I've tried have been great. The best so far have been their Vegas and Phoenix rolls. Also if you like a kick try the Wassup roll. It won't  dissapoint."}
{"text":"A very cozy and quaint little restaurant with truly delicious sushi! The staff are always very kind and welcoming, and their prices are incredibly reasonable. Happy hour is everyday until 6:30. Best sushi in the valley!"}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended so I was eager to check it out. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. 

First, the portion sizes are incredibly large, which you'd think would be great. However, they're SO large that it begs the question of how on earth they're able to afford to give out these portions for a relatively cheap price? We're talking fresh, raw fish, not American-style buffet. Bigger is not always better, especially when it comes to sushi. 

The albacore was pretty tasty, I'll give it that. However, the rice was hot in the sushi and rolls!

Hot rice is disgusting!!!!!! So, so, SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO gross and a huge turn off!!! It warms the fish to the point of it not tasting right. Also if you don't eat the rolls immediately, the entire thing changes its consistency because the hot rice is melding with the cold fish and other vegetables. There is nothing more disappointing and disgusting than unknowingly biting into a warmed piece of sushi with hot rice. 

They also only had 2 sushi chefs in the very packed restaurant. The rolls came out sloppier than I'd make at home. The rice to fish ratio was totally off. There was so much fish in the rolls and so little rice you couldn't even fit the whole thing in your mouth. The rolls were literally falling apart from the moment the chef cut into them, mainly from the lack of tightness when being rolled. It looked like a total mess.

Sushi is just as much about the beautiful presentation and the flavor of the rice, as it is about the taste of the fish. Unfortunately this place had mediocre fish and horrible presentation...and hot rice, which tells me they're not willing to take the time (or care about their customers enough) to present fish properly."}
{"text":"Very slow service! Sushi was just average. A little pricey for the food/service/ambiance. Probably my first & last time here."}
{"text":"Okay, so they no longer do the All You Can Eat Deal...

BUT they have these 9.99 Combo Meal things that come with:  An Entree (I got Mackerel one time, and Ahi Poki another) + Half a roll, soup, salad, tempura and a little fruit for dessert!"}
{"text":"Don't know about the sushi. BUT DO NOT EAT ENTREE'S.  I just ordered to go the Mongolian Chicken $10.00.  The Mongolian Chicken was in the styrofoam box wrapped in a small foil bag.  Not freshly made or prepared.  It was over cooked white chicken chunks, white or brown onions sauteed in some kind of sugar water.  NASTY.  A small corner of the styrofoam box was a couple of small pieces of iceberg lettuce (aka salad), and an ice cream scoop of dry white rice.  All that for $10.00  Buh bye!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from this little hole in the wall behind Big Lots. I was dead wrong. Absolutely delicious and the waitress was a sweetheart. My kids and I were in heaven. I live closer to Zushi's but I'm not a fan. Sushi Kee will be our to go sushi spot."}
{"text":"Our new go to for sushi AND the best bulgogi in the state!! We were in last Sat 20th of June and were treated to the talents and wisdom of sushi chef JJ!  Fabulous time. Fab food. Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I don't usually post a review after visiting an establishment only once, so here are my thoughts after visiting 3 times

Pro: fresh fish which alone by itself is very important 
Con: slow service, unexperienced waitresses on Saturday night only 4 tables full but the service is still slow. Uncleared tables.

Edited: still slow service lack of staff but the fish still fresh!"}
{"text":"We found this place about a year ago when we first moved to Tempe, it was the closest to us. This place has never disappointed us once; the closest was when we ordered takeout and received the wrong order- it was still amazing (kudos to whoever ordered it, sorry!). The sushi is always well made, and the service has always been amazing. Our go-to favorites are the Vegas Roll, Mesa Roll, Spicy Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi."}
{"text":"Horrible prices and the sushi is not worth the money will never go back disappointed sat at counter for 10 mins with no service and there was only 3 tables with people at them"}
{"text":"Stopped here based on the number of high quality yelp reviews.  The prices were reasonable.  Not great, but reasonable.  The decor was a bit lacking, but it seemed like a fun and quaint place.  The service was excellent and our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly.  The sushi was pretty good, but I'd dock it 1 star because all of the rolls kept falling apart when we tried to pick them up.  I've had large rolls at other places before, but none that fell apart like this.  I'm not sure if it was a sushi construction issue, or a rice quality/cooking issue, but it's a real detractor.  Other than that, a decent place to get sushi in the Mesa area."}
