{"text":"Great little coffee shop! Cozy with a good vibe! Great scone! I wish i could have tried them all. There are more bar seats then tables thought, so its more of a one ou two person coffee place if you stay there to enjoy your order!"}
{"text":"I have been twice, and both times the coffee was excellent. Not much in terms of ambience, but the latte is as good as you will get in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for cup of coffee/ need a coffee on the go. This is the right place that serves delicious coffee!"}
{"text":"I came to visit my sister's friends and ended up here after shopping.   I had a biscotti $2, slice of banana bread $3 and a small cup of coffee $2.75  The lady said $7.75 please. I tried to pay with my card but it didn't accept mine. My sister had cash but only American money. She said she would not exchange the currency. My sister asked if a $5 would cover the $7.75 Canadian currency. She was very intent on taking $7.75 American money and actually told her that our money is a lot more. They had internet there, we didn't so it was upsetting that she couldn't look up the correct currency translation.  My sister paid the $7.75 Canadian money but still had a yuck feeling in her stomach.  When I did get WiFi on my phone I found out that the Canadian $7.75 would have been $6.10 American.   It would have been nice if the lady could have looked it up for us. Food was ok but the coffee was strong!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a spot to do a bit of work while in Pointe-Claire and am so glad my supervisor recommended me this little gem! VR is everything I've wanted in a caf√© ... cute decor, homey atmosphere, cheerful and friendly staff, great lighting and amazing coffee! Comprised mainly of bar seats ... the only downside is that it may be harder to find seats during busier periods if you're visiting with friends."}
