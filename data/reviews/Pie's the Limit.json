{"text":"Driving through town on interstate. Saw location in Yelp. Great pizza, fresh ingredients that you can choose for one great price. Great crust and sauce. Noise level is loud, hard to talk over noise, with all the echo. Salad is pre-made, no choice if ingredients. Minus on the instant lemon tasting tea."}
{"text":"I had this pizza when they first opened. So good! Choose your own crust,cheese,and whatever else toppings you like.  Fun concept staffed with super friendly people.  I like that I can have create my own pasta and salad as well. $7.99 for your choice of any of the 3 is fantastic. I will continue to eat and explore this place."}
{"text":"We decided to try a bit of everything (pizza, pasta, garlic bread, desserts) and it was all delicious! The amount of vegetarian (and vegan!!!) options were well above what we are used to in the area and the guys working there were so friendly and obviously passionate about what they do. Without a doubt we will be going again and recommending to everyone."}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick lunch and remembered seeing this had opened at the Crossing in Champaign.  I was surprised to find out that you can order multiple toppings for your pizza and the price $7.99 is the same for an unlimited number of toppings.  It's a good size and I actually couldn't finish the entire pizza in one sitting.  It's a good value but it's also a high quality pizza.  A great crust nice and crisp and the 5 ingredients I ordered were all very good.  I ordered the spicy marinara and it was sufficiently spicy without being overpowering.  It only took a few minutes to bake in their oven so service was quick.  This place has great service and pizza.  Hard to go wrong here."}
{"text":"\"This is the best pizza restaurant I've ever been to. The decor is very modern. The service is fast and the staff are friendly. I really like Pie's the Limit!\"  The kids dictated that to us as they sat and devoured their pizza asking when we could come back again, interspersed with full mouthed raves. They really enjoyed the self serve condiments as well.  The husband unit and I also loved our pizzas. Fresh ingredients and awesome crust. Full family satisfaction!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give this place a try on an early Saturday evening. The idea of getting  fresh pizza with as many ingredients I wanted for $7.99? Preposterous!  I chose to go with a conventional pizza -- marinara sauce and shredded mozzarella -- and my wife went with a sauce mixture of basil pesto and alfredo with shredded mozzarella and feta. We added in toppings of our choosing which, in my case, included sausage, old world pepperoni, bacon, anchovies, fresh mushrooms, banana peppers, green peppers, red onions and jalapenos. Yes -- I am a fan of the garbage pizza!  The line went a little slow since everything was made to order, but the service was friendly and polite. We sat down and a short time later the pizzas were delivered to our table. Wow! Based on the size of the dough, I was surprised to see that the pizza was much bigger than I expected. Two people could dine on one pizza if they were modestly hungry. My wife and I both ate over half our pizzas and had some left to take home.  The quality of our pizzas was very good. They were cooked to perfection and the ingredients were fresh and tasty. The only small negative was that the bottom of the pizzas were a little moist.  We will be telling our friends to give Pie's the Limit a try. It is clearly the best pizza deal in Champaign-Urbana."}
{"text":"Love it. I've been to Mod Pizza in California and it's basically the same - get exactly what you want without worrying about toppings prices. The employees are super friendly too."}
{"text":"Stopped by there with my brother to have dinner the other day. It took quite a long time to get a pizza as they seem to be understaffed. The pizza was average, it was cool they let you put on a lot of ingredients, but the ingredients are kind of cheap especially the sausage."}
{"text":"Probably the nicest staff anywhere in Champaign-Urbana. I go there often and am impressed with everything they do every time I go. I also think it's the best tasting pizza in town and that might be because of the customization can be exactly what I want so easily, but it's only one of the factors.   They need to never leave Champaign-Urbana. I would be sad if they ever left and I know a lot of people would feel the same. I have been told Pie's the Limit is better than Blaze Pizza, so if you want an awesome pizza experience go to Pie's the Limit!"}
{"text":"I was apprehensive when I first got in here, the pizza crusts were so flat, and once I had all the toppings put on I questioned if I was going to like it (didn't look appetizing). However I was pleasantly surprised when my food arrived. I will say it was not super quick like I have seen in other reviews. Yet the pizza was actually rather good and the crust puffed up nicely. I also liked the variety of toppings- broccoli, hot giardiniera, saut√©ed mushrooms and onions, etc. I will say, I was a little put off they had both spinach and basil on the menu, and when I asked for basil on my pizza they pulled out one piece of spinach and placed it on my pizza... so apparently they don't have basil? A little deceiving. Overall, pizza was rather tasty. Disclaimer: I was starving when I walked in there so I am not sure how that may have affected my review ;)"}
{"text":"Like subway, you watch as hey create your personal pizza with whatever you want on top. Vegan cheese is a great option for vegans craving a pizza with cheese on it!  He crust appears preformed, not sure if it's rolled or from frozen. Kids size, salads, and tons of options, including roasted garlic, eight kinds of cheese, and loads of veggies and even gluten free crust option. Gas fired 750 degree oven makes the pizza ready in five minutes. I had a vegan cheese, sriracha spiced marinara sauce with roasted garlic, spinach, roasted red peppers, green olives, and red onions. It was crispy, fresh and fast. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"11\" inch pizza one price unlimited toppings for $8.99. What a fantastic deal. Then you make a salad unlimited toppings for $7.99.  The place is clean and welcoming with friendly quick service."}
{"text":"Wow this is some good pizza!  Fresh ingredients and fast service - delicious crust - cooked to order - tasty!"}
{"text":"Wonderful. We stopped here while road tripping to Indiana and it is beyond worth the stop. Clean, friendly and welcoming atmosphere. They make the pizza right in front of you with fresh toppings. Fresh salads and the prices are awesome too. $30.00 for 2 kids pizzas, 1 regular, side salad 2 cinnamon pizza and 4 drinks. Great tasting, filling and it was not greasy like most chain places!"}
{"text":"What's not to enjoy?  Great food, polite and quick service, and a very convenient location.  It's easy to please everyone in the family with the wide variety of toppings.  From start to finish it takes only about 6 minutes.  Glad this place is one the southwest side so I don't have to drive into north Champaign!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great. Good crust but only thin. All the topping you want at the same price. 11\" pie. You should give it a try"}
{"text":"Very affordable & extremely delicious.  I love that you can have unlimited toppings & for the same price we would normally paid for one pizza, we were able to get 3 pizzas with whatever each person wanted ( Plus, they have green olives which normally I'm out voted on ).  The ingredients are fresh & we were able to order online & have our order ready for pickup in about 15 mins.  Pie's the Limit is my new favorite go to pizza spot."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and friend and WOW. This place is awesome. $8.99 unlimited toppings? Count me in. Employees are very nice too."}
{"text":"Had heard about this place from a few friends. Finally, made it in to give it a try. Very glad we did! My favorite part of a pizza is the cheese. I was worried that while they offer unlimited toppings, the unlimited didn't include the cheese. I was wrong. I did a butter and garlic rub, shredded mozzarella, fresh mozzarella, provolone, broccoli, giardiniera and a little parmesan on top. I also tend to leave the pizza bones behind. This crust was perfect. So very tasty. No bones left behind but, needed a box for the third of the pizza I couldn't finish. So, great pizza, great cost, lots of food, plenty of seating, plenty of parking, friendly staff, no traffic - I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Kinda like Blaze but better and less expensive. The girls are cute btw."}
{"text":"What a great surprise great pizza very friendly staff awesome prices . And they even asked us if they put enough of everything on our pizza's. The crust was perfect not too thin or thick .We will be back often ."}
{"text":"Great pizza--excellent crust, good sauce and great choice of toppings and cheeses, including fresh mozzarella. Far superior to other pizza places of this style we have tried in other places (Blaze, Azzip, etc). We stopped in here while traveling. We will definitely make it a regular stop as we pass by Champaign often."}
{"text":"It is an alright place in a shopping plaza that has been doom-and-gloom for many restaurateurs. While I do not wish the same doom for this place, it already looks like it might be inevitable.   The service was fine, the ingredients and food were fine, and it might be just a bit pricey for Champaign, but they've definitely taken a page out of the playbook of other 'design-your-own-pizza' shops in many other places, so maybe it'll catch-on.   I went on a Friday afternoon around noon, and while there were some customers waiting and eating their pizzas and salads, it was fairly empty. From my experiences elsewhere of this genre of restaurant, I expected a healthy wait at lunchtime, but the lack of line was welcome, so I could order on-the-spot was great. I just got a pepperoni pizza, and while they list an assortment of ingredients, they are not labeled when you go through the line. I was very happy they do not skimp on ingredients.   The only odd thing was the person who was preparing my pizza was also making salads for the drive-thru window. So I had to wait for the employee to finish stages of the salad before I carried on with my pizza. A bit bizarre, but given the lack of crowds and small staff, I understand the need.   Overall, the pizza was alright. I guess the experience of naming ingredients and crafting your own pizza is somewhat fresh and novel, but given the price, it is not worth it. For simple pizzas with one, two, or three toppings, the price is lower and the size is greater for the chains. While the quality might suffer slightly, I didn't find Pie's the Limit to be (even remotely) superior to other joints.   The concept is somewhat novel for the area, the food is acceptable, but overall, its nothing special."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and boy oh boy was I impressed! The interior is clean and casual. The pizzas are extremely reasonable in price especially given the fact that they have the choice of unlimited toppings. They have a wide variety of sauces aswell. You can either choose to make your own pizza or select from the speciality menu. I believe you can tweak the speciality menu as well since they're going to put the toppings infront of you.  The pizzas took less than 10 minutes to be served to us. Plus the young girl behind the counter was super friendly. Helped immensely in choosing toppings and sauces for my custom pizza and actually suggested I mix the sauces which turned out to be an amazing choice!  Both of them tasted great in their own accord and I was obsessed with the crispness and taste of the crust. I can't wait to come back and try different combinations.  Oh and the bathrooms were super clean they even had a sign to let them know if they need attention."}
{"text":"Pizza was real good, all the ingredients were fresh and tasty. Better than the other fast-fired pizza places in the area, do recommend"}
{"text":"5/5 stars for the sheer $8.99 value.   Aside from Domino's & Little Caesar's, I'm not sure where you can get can some 'zza for such a great price (and those big chains sure don't offer unlimited toppings). Pie's the Limit offers unlimited toppings, so it really is the best way to go.   My family and I dined here for the first time late on a Saturday afternoon. We walked in and were served right away as we were the only guests in the restaurant.   Clean, modern, simply decorated restaurant. The employee who assisted us was super friendly and great at explaining how the 'process' of ordering/choosing toppings worked. Pizza came out of the oven within minutes and was delivered to our table by the pizza maker herself.  We ordered the Mediterranean from the menu and my in-laws built their own. We ordered the two 11\" pies, as well as some garlic cheese bread. This was enough food for 4 and we took leftovers home.   Hubs and I would definitely come come back. Food was above average, tasty, not greasy and staff was nice. I think the location of the restaurant itself is great, at least for us. Convenient parking.  I highly recommend Pie's the Limit if you're looking to cure your hankering for pizza, an inexpensive family dinner out or even a date night."}
{"text":"I really loved the assembly line style in this place and the staff were extremely helpful with answering questions. Unlimited toppings if you opt for the deal, and they have an abundance of options. It's made fairly quickly and the pizza turned out great. My experience here was better than Blaze, so even though I live in north Champaign, I'd rather drive down and eat here."}
{"text":"We love this place! Pizza is so fresh, and the toppings just don't quit! Good salads and pasta, too. East service, and reasonable prices! The pizza is never the least bit greasy,also, and is heartburn free for me!  Can't get enough!"}
{"text":"The hits keep coming. This place and concept are incredible. The Staff is friendly and diligent, the ingredients are fresh and delicious and the only limit to your dining is your imagination. Once you have your ingredient combo dialed in, this stuff gets addictive."}
{"text":"If you love build-your-own restaurants and you love pizza, this needs to be your next stop! You get unlimited toppings like various meats, cheeses, veggies and even crunchy tortilla strips! They give you suggested combinations or you can choose your own combos. It's perfect for those who want affordable, fresh, delicious pizza with vegan and gluten-free options available!"}
{"text":"Pie's the Limit is our new go to pizza place. Great choice of toppings, the crust is good and fresh. Good and crispy crust and try the fresh mozzarella.   Very good and clean staff takes care of you."}
{"text":"We just ate at Pie's The Limit in Champaign and it was excellant! We needed a place that served Gluten free crust and they did. They had tons of options for veggies which worked great for us as well. Our pizza maker was Sydney and she was excellant! She was super helpful and knowledgeable and was great at making sure she followed the typical gluten free protocol. Overall all of us were super happy and we were glad we picked this place."}
{"text":"Choose your own adventure: you pick all your toppings to custom order a pizza. I got efficient, friendly service, a fast delicious pizza at a pretty good price. Nice!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Great pizza, fast! Great quality. It's comparable to Blaze. What more needs to be said?"}
{"text":"For $8.99 you get unlimited toppings and they are delicious. I love coming here and getting pesto, feta, chicken, banana peppers, black olives and roasted garlic. They put a lot of toppings on so the pizza is always flavorful and you get toppings in each bite. They also have a punch card so when you buy 10 pizzas you get one free!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review So the old Papa del's location at the crossing is now closed and has been replaced by a new restaurant on the block! I was surprised to hear about this from my coworker as I have not seen any articles of it in the newspaper or fliers. If you have been to Blaze pizza, it is the same concept; pick your own unlimited toppings and they will cook up a super fresh pizza for you. The staff here are super friendly and greet you as soon as you enter the door. They have 2 types of crust, a normal thicker than thin crust pizza and a gluten friendly dough (read that this is not gluten free as they cannot prevent cross contamination). Next you get to pick from the multiple sauces, I went with the original marinara. They have multiple types of cheeses including fresh mozzarella and provolone! Check out my picture as I cannot type out all of the ingredients, but the highlights would be basil, tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms, old world pepperoni, chicken, and meat ball. Once you finish ordering, just hop over to the counter to check out and your set. The pizza comes out pipping fresh, the crust is crisp and can stand on it's own. For 7.99, you get a customized pizza with the toppings you want. Once you goes pie's the limit all of the other fast food pizza locations cannot compare! An added plus is plenty of parking, pre-order with the app and pick up through drive through, and the friendliest staff.  Pros: unlimited toppings for 7.99, friendly service, quick food, fresh ingredients  Cons: It can be a bit overwhelming with all the ingredients, but that's a plus  Hidden deals: Go to the website and sign up for the e-club to get a free soda with your purchase  Health code rating: A. Brand new store, very clean."}
{"text":"We walked in and were immediately greeted by a super friendly dude who explained the situation. Basically you can build your own pizza for a standard price of $7.99 even if you use unlimited toppings! It was awesome. They have several sauces, cheeses, spices, meats, veggies, and dressings to choose from, everything seemed like it we very good quality too. Then it goes into the rotating oven and comes out super crispy and perfect! I think all in all for two huge pizzas and two drinks we paid $22 and still had half each of our pizzas left over for later. Well worth it!  The nice guy working also told us about the app where you can make your order online and pick it up via drive-thru. Super convenient and I'll definitely be checking that out.  I'm definitely coming back here and will be trying their salads and pastas next time too!"}
