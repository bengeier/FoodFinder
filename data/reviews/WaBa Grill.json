{"text":"Took too long
Food was OK. Good for diet 'cuse I wouldn't eat much.
To pricey for value
Atmosphere was nice
Servers were looking forward to being off and away.
I probably won't be back"}
{"text":"After going through every food place in my head, I couldn't decide for the life of me what to eat. When I saw the sign for Waba I decided to try it. 

Walking in, everyone was very friendly. The woman at the cash register answered all my questions with a smile.

The food was delicious! I had the chicken vegetable bowl. The veggies were crisp (not over-cooked), the brown rice wasn't dry, and the chicken had just the right amount of teriyaki sauce. I opted to pay the $1.50 to get avocado on top and it was definitely worth it! They give you a half of an avocado sliced on top.

Overall the food was great, the staff was friendly, food came out quick, and it was worth the price because I got 2 meals out of it."}
{"text":"Poor hygiene by employees.  Spinning rice scoop, wiped face and the continued to serve rice without washing hands.  Also witnessed employees resting body parts (rear) on food prep surfaces...  I do not expect this restaurant to be open too much longer if this is not corrected.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great staff and food is fresh and tastie. Been there three time this week for lighter meals at lunch."}
{"text":"This is SO FREAKING DELICIOUS! I got the tofu with brown rice, kale salad without dressing, and steamed veggies- all topped with 1/2 of an avocado. I added lots of hot sauce as I ate, it was a huge amount and every bite was so tasty! The employees who greet you when you walk in and take your order at the counter are so friendly, the bathrooms and dining room were incredibly clean, and the interior design is so bright, modern, and pretty! Felt comfortable enough to relax in there and enjoy our food slowly instead of rushing, which is how I typically feel at these types of restaurants. I dream about this meal & have been back several times. The iced tea is also delicious, and I love that there are chopsticks available. Everything was perfect! I love Waba!"}
{"text":"When my husband and I originally started going to this restaurant, we thought it was a wonderful find. Every week it seems to go further and further downhill. Yesterday my husband and I were served cold meat and cold vegetables. This was after waiting 25 minutes for our food to arrive. The reason we were given for having to wait is because the \"cook\"Had to \"make \"the avocado. In addition, we ordered a salad as one of the sides and were given approximately two bites, very small bites mind you of salad. When I brought this to the managers attention, she told me that the only thing they could do was remake our food. 

This place has terrible staff, terrible management, and although we used to really enjoy the food, somehow they have made that terrible too. Beware of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Seriously I can't get enough of Waba Grill, I go there at least 4 times a week, my favorite is the half and half bowl you get both chicken and steak . The food taste delicious, always fresh. Also its low in sodium and fat which makes Waba even better. The staffs are excellent , always smile and greeted when I walk in. The place is very clean and neat. Overall I love Waba grill."}
{"text":"My daughter and I just ate in here. Nice sized portions. I got the chicken bowl with dark meat and white rice. My daughter got the chicken vegetable bowl with white rice. We ordered a small kale salad (they gave us a large and charged for a large) so we could try the oriental salad dressing, which was awesome!  The counter service was nice.  Only negative thing I have to say is... their is a guy that cuts the meat a little behind the front counter that is extremely loud chopping the meat on the cutting board."}
{"text":"Fast and healthy food. Not many pleaces of this kind on the west valley.

I ate the steak salad and my boyfriend the chicken rice and veggies bowl. The taste and the amount wete both very good. We'll definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Was at Tempe town lake and saw there was a Waba near by. I typically go to the one in North Phoenix but this one was just as great. Awesome staff, it's new and we'll maintained. Idk If everyone needs to be a master at cooking salmon before the start working here but my salmon was perfect! Juicy and grilled just right. This will definitely be my go-to place when ever im in Tempe."}
{"text":"Awesome place for healthy clean eating!! I get the chicken veggie bowl all the time. One of my favorite teriyaki places to stop by for lunch. The salmon is also pretty good, usually if I come for dinner I'll have that."}
{"text":"Solid for what it is, simple bowls. Love the freshness, the veggies were perfectly cooked to order. Not pre-mixed, so you can get no cabbage or just broccoli, etc. 
It was clean and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Saw Waba grill on Yelp and was in the area so we figured we would give it a try.. it was empty considering it was 6:30 on a Wednesday. I ordered a Waba plate which has both chicken and steak while my wife ordered a steak bowl. We grabbed a seat and expected a 5 minute wait or so considering the place advertises fast food and there was no one there. 25 minutes later the girl at the counter finally waddles over and drops our food off without an apology for the wait or anything. I figured hey, maybe they had to make a fresh batch of steak or something so I didn't say anything. Both ordered were ice cold. I wonder how long our food sat there before it was brought out. Steak was cold and was tough like beef jerky, chicken was actually good but unfortunately was cold. Seems like a great concept that we were excited to try but poor execution ruined our experience."}
{"text":"Small fast food, occupancy might be 60? Pretty busy for a Sunday. Definitely fresh food and pleasant service. 
A little loud, I'm not sure if it's the place is self (echos) or just everyone is loud? 
Wasn't as impressed as the reviews, not saying it was bad just not as good as I anticipated 
 Steak is just average flank steak really, my vegetables weren't steamed enough, quite crunchy 
Would I go again?  No"}
{"text":"Shout out to Brandon for holding it down. Great customer service. Attended me quickly and had me going in no time. Go Dodgers."}
{"text":"Food was descent. Lots of healthy choices to choose from."}
{"text":"Came here by accident! Food was fresh And delicious. A great value as well. The entrees were large enough to share and the place was spotless. We will definitely return to Waba Grill"}
{"text":"I love getting food at the Avondale location. It's close to where I work so my coworkers and I go there a couple times a week. What makes WaBa great is they don't live by the false notion that you need a lot of salt and fat to make food taste good. Their meals are low sodium, low fat. Just grilled meat, rice, and vegetables, the way it should be. The service is always on point, too!

Favorites: Salmon bowl with brown rice, or the Half/half bowl."}
{"text":"Wiley and Brandon are awesome. These guys were holding it down Saturday night after my workout. This is my go to for a good post workout meal. The waba plate is my absolute favorite as far as food goes but everything here is great. Rice is on point. The steak and chicken is good. I love their steamed veggies. yum yum yum. Not to mention healthy.  Check this place out. Good food. Good vibes. Healthy and good pricing considering the amount of food you get and the quality of food. Will always be back!"}
{"text":"Really awesome food and good customer service! The chicken veggie bowl is my favorite. They also give military discount."}
{"text":"Got 2 veggies bowls to go with avocado and of course it didn't come with avocado. So I payed $17 for rice, carrots, and broccoli. I guess it's on me for not checking my own order before I left, expecting them to do it was a stretch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite healthy places to eat! This place is always a go to when ordering take out. I love to get a wabba bowl w/ veggies!"}
{"text":"Nice for a quick bite. I always get the tofu bowl but the tofu plate is good too. I love that they have tofu and vegan options. Clean place including the kitchen."}
{"text":"I had the chicken bowl at Waba Grill and thought that the chicken was moist. I had the white and brown rice. They had green onions at the condiments area along with some jalapenos and carrots. I liked how they didn't have any charred sections on the meat. Overall it was tasty but a bit simple."}
{"text":"I have alot of friends in California that love this place and are always posting their food pics from here on IG as post workout meal. Finally saw a Waba grill here in Az and just had to see what it was all about, and I have to say I was VERY happy. Low calorie, high protein meals that do not lack in the flavor department! Price isn't bad either! If they would only put one up in North Phoenix, Glendale area I'd be a happier girl but there really is no reason I cannot drive 20 min for a healthy, tasty meal!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with my family. My mom and dad are in their 80s. My daughter is in her 20s. We all enjoyed the food here.  It was friendly and clean. The food was good. We all enjoyed our experience here. I wouldn't bring a large group here though. You order at counter. So a big group might be a bit awkward."}
{"text":"Really good and healthy. Cheap! I like the chicken with veggies bowl and no rice for those that r dieting!"}
{"text":"The food is good; however, the service is terrible. Today the employees were supposed to be making customers orders but instead were talking on their cell phones. It was obvious it was a personal call when one guy asked the other what his girlfriend said. Then they would walk to the back, where they could still be seen, to continue their personal phone call. This is the 3rd time this has happened. I like the food and the veggies, but I just can't take the slow innappropriate service, especially when Yogis Grill and Chipotle is close by."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service,  very clean environment,  reasonable prices,  great healthy and tasty food!
I went on Saturday at 4:30 pm and was serviced by Liz.
My wife and I will definitely visit again.
PHOENIX needs more restaurants like yours."}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon bowl with avocado and no rice (only veggies). Sooo delicious! Serves generous portions. Place is clean and staff was welcoming and helpful. Great for low carb/fat diets. Delicious post workout meal!!"}
{"text":"This place is just like Yogi's Teriyaki Grill; which I love. 
Except Waba grill screws you on the price, sauce, and amount of food. For $7 I expected more than a small bowl of sticky rice with one chicken breast crappily cut up. AND VERY LITTLE SAUCE when I asked for extra."}
{"text":"I truly believe if I had gone to the grocery store and bought a bowl of chicken, veggies and rice out of the frozen food section it would have tasted better than this lousy excuse for food that this place serves. I have attempted to eat there twice at two totally different locations with basically the same result. Everything tastes like it was very pre prepared and the overall quality is just not good. On top of that, both times the food was served tepid and the vegetables tasted like they'd been previously frozen. Literally the lowest quality teriyaki-style restaurant I have eaten at, and I have eaten at literally dozens. For what they charge, it should taste much better. The end."}
{"text":"While I like the concept, and enjoy the options, it seems to be very poorly run. The employees are very nonchalant, as if they don't care much about what they're doing. I waited over 15min for ONE salmon bowl, which I really feel is completely unacceptable. Not to mention, they only had 2 employees working on a very busy Sunday."}
{"text":"While I like the food, the biggest draw was the sauce dispenser that allowed you to use more sauce on the meat and rice. Well, that is gone and they will only give you one little packet which lasted for two bites.

We tried to get more and were told \"we already gave you extra sauce\" which was one packet a piece.

The chicken plate was way too dry without the extra sauce and we won't go back."}
{"text":"Waba is a healthier Ono Hawaiin, but if you are looking to try out their chicken and steak, it is better to order them separately.  From a pricing standpoint it is cheaper to order separate than to mix them.  They give you plenty of rice, probably more than the meat itself.  Aside from the side salad, you will have to order the veggies separate."}
{"text":"This place is a good option if you're looking for something low key and healthy. I'm definitely a chicken and rice kinda girl so I tried this place on a whim for lunch. To my surprise, I really enjoyed my meal! First off, who cares if there's no chopsticks...you eat with a fork 95% of the time, do you not? So, previous poster, why complain about using a fork??? That's petty. Anywho, I ordered the chicken bowl with no cabbage and doubled up on the other veggies, carrots and broccoli (my faves). I only eat white meat chicken if I can help it and this seemed to be majority white meat chicken. I feel like it was probably chicken thighs. No complaints here. The meat is chopped into bite sized pieces, which was nice. The veggies were steamed and tasted fresh and healthy. The sauce had a good amount of flavor to it and if you need extra, they have it openly available. I took one star off because, in my opinion, the white rice was super watered down and mushy...maybe it was the bottom of the pot rice, but it could've been better. I'll still go back and try again bc everything else was great."}
{"text":"Originally from Southern California - this is a taste of home. We were so excited when we seen it was going to a location near us."}
{"text":"Waited 30 min from time.i placed my order until i received order and there was no one in line in front of me.  Oh and they got the order wrong.  Ordered steak and chicken white meat combo and they forgot the steak.  The steak was chopped so many times it was tiny pieces of string steak.  Total bummer."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast healthy food this is the spot for you.  Quick service delicious options. Will come again."}
{"text":"Great service! Food quality is very fresh. I will recommend ask for the source on the side otherwise it will be too much."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, i always come here to eat mostly everyday , the reason i aint giving it 5 stars because , they always mess up my order EVERYtime i come here , But other than that , i love it"}
{"text":"Walked in, checked out the menu and went to order. I think I bothered the girl talk g orders because she had that \"what?!\" Look on her face. I asked for a. Steak plate and she replied \"we're out of steak, read the sign\" as she pointed to a the hand written sign taped to the register.  Sorry to have bugged."}
{"text":"When the restaurant first opened my family and I had a great experience. Not sure what happened but this restaurant went down hill fast. Nothing tasted fresh, food was cold and just chewy. We had the chicken and beef veggies bowl, it just lacked flavor. Pretty disappointing after making the drive over."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go when I need a quick healthy meal! The food is always cooked to perfection and the employees are always friendly!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food was great, staff was very friendly! The WaBa bowl was so tasty! Fresh Steak and Chicken with brown rice. Yummmmm! I really miss the frozen yogurt but this is a great replacement!"}
{"text":"Great prices for what you get here. Quality was up to standard and the food came out quick. Very similar to Yogis Grill but a lot cheaper, more meat options and faster. Will for sure be coming back. I had the salmon which was moist and great. My mom had the spicy pork which had a lot spice to it and we also tried the chicken which was great as well."}
{"text":"New rice bowl place - ok, let's try it.

Ordered the 'waba' bowl (half chicken, half beef) to give both a try - no veggies, white rice.

They call my name - I grab my tray and ask for chop sticks.
Front guy:    \"We don't have them.\"
Me:              \"What?  This is a rice bowl place, is it not?\"
Manager:     \"We don't stock chopsticks\".

WTH?  A rice bowl place without chopsticks?  That's got to be against some law somewhere, doesn't it?

So, sat down and ate with my food scoop - here are my observations:

1) Beef - dry
2) Chicken - dry (and no dark meat option)
3) Rice - dry
4) No Coke - Pepsi (so I drank water)
5) Napkins are so cheap they're useless (a little water spilled on the ground - it was slippery - I tried to mop it up with 3 napkins - barely accomplished)

They have pump-pots with hot sauce and waba sauce.
Get some.

In conclusion - WaBa must be some sort of abbreviation for \"Why Bother?\""}
{"text":"We LOVED this place. Excellent customer service from the beginning. We were greeted and walked through the menu and ordering for our first visit. They even gave us samples of the steak and chicken. The food was DELICIOUS! The steak meat was so tender and fresh. The plate came with rice and salad and it was a very filling meal for $8!"}
{"text":"Kind of like Panda Express with fewer options and a 30% price increase. All the food was cooked and seasoned well. Of course, as is appropriate with the type of food, they start with cheap skirt steak and chicken bits, so you may get a bit of gristle, but it was minimal and tasted good and was tender. I'd come back if nearby, but wouldn't search it out."}
{"text":"If you like Avocado don't bother asking them for it. If you like to pay for Avocado and not receive it, ask them for it. This has a opened to me atleast 5 times with this place."}
{"text":"Unfortunate experience yesterday mid afternoon.  First time at Waba, see them in LA all the time.  Chicken was fine, beef was bnlack...grisly and unappetizing.  Staff was terrible, loud music in back....gossiping and laughing in back, no one on service line.  Very little effort by this shift."}
{"text":"Great chicken, the prices are decent, I like that you can add veggies yourself, I would say it's better than flame broiler, the service is a little slow though"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because I have been craving a good terayaki bowl and what can I say, it failed.  I ordered the chicken bowl with veggies and brown rice and the chicken tasted old and the veggies tasted like it was boiled with fish.  I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by 20 minutes after they open. Ordered the white rice steak bowl with drink. The soda machine was not even working or turned on. The green onions did not look fresh. The steak did not look like they did it today, it was dry and burnt. Meat was not even hot, but the rice was ok. 10:20am you should have all that ready like the other Waba Grills. Second time this happens, I will be coming to this location anymore. Bye."}
{"text":"Anyone that's from California knows about this place. I was so happy this is in Phoenix when ever I'm in town I can stop by. I actually bumped into this passing McDowell. It's close by the 10 and 101 freeway west of Phoenix. I came in and the place it's a bit small but looks nice. I ordered the usual a steak bowl with white rice. I noticed compared to L.A. here they have a bit of that fat nasty meat on the steak in Cali they never had anything but that bomb thin slice steak. Now the sauce is a bit strong with what I usually put on my bowl back home. Get with it Waba Grill you can fool the AZ people but not the Angelenos. I'll comeback again and try the other stuff they have on the menu and add some pics."}
{"text":"This place sounds good in theory. It just reeks of corporate inefficiency though. First off, the few times I came here the place was competely understaffed. Which is probably why the dining area is filthy. There's one person prepping and cooking the food, and one person on register? I wait 15 minutes with one person in front of me for some chopped chicken, with rice and veggies. This company if obviously too cheap to have more people on staff. Also not sure what's with the kids who work here, but if you're going to work while you're high, make sure you can still perform your job and aren't forgetting orders mid-sentence..."}
{"text":"It was ok. We most certainly won't ever go back.
We were not impressed. The side of fruit they give you is a third of an orange with a Peel on and the kale salad just tasted like they squeezed a orange on it. My chicken was dry, and brown rice was over cooked...
The place was clean."}
{"text":"Pretty decent spot,I've had better.a bit pricey for a simple teriyaki bowl,over priced kale salad as well"}
{"text":"A little disappointed 

I stopped by WaBa Grill today for lunch. I thought I  would give WaBa Grill a try after reading so many positive reviews.

WaBa Grill is  nice, clean and bright. I was  greeted as I entered the restaurant and the staff was very friendly. I placed my lunch order and sat down, and my entree was prepared quickly. 

On this visit I ordered a steak bowl with white rice and an ice tea.  I have to be honest my entree was not very good. The beef was tough, the rice was over cooked, and I did not particularly care for the sauce.

I will probably revisit WaBa Grill in the near future and maybe try a different entree and see how that is."}
{"text":"Tofu veggie bowl was decent (as expected). The tofu was quite soft however and not cut up into cubes or slices. Two big squares, grilled quickly but nice flavor from the sauce. (I added extra teriyaki). 

Lots of veggies which I enjoyed and good brown rice. 

Great fast and cheap option for Veg eaters out there. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I enjoy WaBa Grill   Especially that they have a choice of steak chicken and if you want sigh they have salmon on the menu. Options are around choice of protein, grilled steak,chicken or fish, your carb, brown or white rice, and veggies. Simple healthy options. 
This place is right next to wingstop. The place is spacious, good dine in area. Service is good. Cashier was friendly, courteous, and polite. Quickly to take our. Order
Food came out quickly and the order was correct. Only issue the run out of white rice. 
I would come to this place again if I the area ."}
{"text":"It is a very clean location and the ingredients are fresh. However, it is just that. I think that it is way over-priced for the amount of food that you get considering that 80% of what you get is rice. How FN expensive is rice? Right? The 3oz of vegetables (.35 cost) and meat 5-6oz (1.25). With packaging you might have $2.00 tied up the whole thing and you want me to pay $10++ for rice?

It is my choice to go there and I went to take my girl for a quick bite as it is near her location. Honestly, there are many other options nearby that provide a much better deal. Just two rice bowls with drinks was like $23.  Crazy! That could be 15 soft tacos, a Burrito Supreme and a drink. That is without Diamond Back Home Run days. WTH?

I'll give it this. The place is immaculate, the ingredients are fresh and the location isn't bad. For me, it is not a perceived value. Form your own opinions though.

{"text":"My daughter works next door and told us we should try it.  We all ordered and when the food came, it looked fantastic!  Larger healthy portions.  Except, I thought I had ordered the #1!  As my wife and daughter told me \"no, you said 8\", I realized that I realized that I was stating the $8 price of the #1!  Senior moment!  So I had just said what the hell, I love salmon when Mercedes was walking by and overheard the whole exchange and offered to make me a #1. I thanked her and assured her that 1) it was my mistake and 2) I love salmon anyway and should probably be eating a salad anyways.  5 mins later she showed up with a small rice bowl of steak and chicken (a mini #1) and said \"I want you to try it anyways!  Have a great nigh!\"  

Great food and amazing customer service!!"}
{"text":"The food was great. High quality protein source. Great service and great owner. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the salmon plate for lunch today. It was delicious!! My salmon was glazed in a light, sweet teriyaki sauce over a soft bed of rice. The fruit of the day was orange slices. They also give you a small side salad. I sat and drank a refreshing, ice cold coconut tea while I waiting for my food. They bring it out to your table for you. A healthy lunch option without sacrificing flavor! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Good for quick and mostly healthy food. The chicken and steak bowls are good. It's very fast, so we go there when we have long workdays with no time to cook but want something quick and healthy and are not in the mood for sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ate here in the past and it great.  Food taste is not the same and I ordered a side of chicken and got a few bites.  Time to head back to Samari Sams. 

I'll give it one more try in a few weeks then write it off."}
{"text":"This is a healthier alternative to fast food.  I appreciate that the sodium counts aren't through the roof also.  It's clean, and tucked away in a not very busy strip mall.  Really like the manager.  They also offer  veterans a discount.  We always like to support companies that support the troops.  We had the salmon plate.  It comes over rice.  We chose brown.  Has a small salad with a Thai dressing that comes on it and a serving of fruit.  It was just the right size for the two of us to split for lunch with no leftovers.  The salmon was a little fishy tasting for me.  But what you expect for $10.  We will come back."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is friendly & it is super clean. I have tried many different things on the menu but my favorite is the chicken salad plate. I enjoy coming here for lunch & dinner the food is healthy & I love their sauces."}
{"text":"I ordered from Uber eats the first time I had Waba Grill and it was DELICIOUS. That is the only reason I'm giving two stars. I came in for an early meal before shopping. The restroom was filthy, the dining room floor was unswept and sticky. There were no other customers and it was 10:15am. Then I got my salmon rice bowl. Veggies barely streamed and crunchy. Rice wasn't hot and the salmon was barely warm. What a shame."}
{"text":"Wife disliked the mundane quality of the grilled chicken that came with the chicken salad.  The sauce on beef, rice, and vegetables plate was slightly too sweet but the rice and salad were good. The kale salad is a welcome deviation from romaine."}
{"text":"It's pretty average in taste, it's slightly better in price. It's filling, and although I've found the chicken to have more than the desired amount of fatty pieces, the amount spent is fair. The service is good, both visits with a smile and chipper attitude. I'm a sucker for chicken teriyaki, so I'll be stopping in from time to time."}
{"text":"This place is similar to Teriyaki chicken bowl(Abq). They advertised fresh meat, so I tried it for the first time. Got the Waba plate: 4pieces of watermelon, kale mix and brown rice with beef/chicken. The beef was more like jerky and the chicken was dry and no flavor. I don't know it's fresh meat or not, but my food came out less than 5mins. Teriyaki chicken bowl is better."}
{"text":"Oh dear, 
The service is great but I think this maybe the last time I come here. I came a couple weeks ago and there was a huge mosquito infestation. I thought I would give it a bit and come back hoping the problem would be gone. They still have many mosquitos and now there's a daddy long legs with a web and about 20-30 misquotes in it. Guess that a blessing in disguise though. Think you guys need to shut down and get everything sorted out"}
{"text":"The staff is very helpful.  The food is fresh, tasty and fills you up.  They make it easy to eat healthy."}
{"text":"The wifey and i were looking for something new, seen a post on FB for Waba Grill.......so we went ahead and tried it out, we really enjoyed the Chicken bowel (wifey) and the Half Chicken Half Beef bowel (for me). Great flavor, tender chicken and beef......i got mine with brown rice snd veggies, just delicious. ......would come back to try the grilled salmon  over rice."}
{"text":"Good, healthy fast food! Great vegetarian options with tofu, brown rice, and steamed veggies. Tasty and good for you!"}
{"text":"Finally...we eat Waba weekly in California...now we can in AZ!!! The food here is so fresh, cooked perfect and priced just right. Even though the location is new, the staff is so friendly and fast! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"amazing rice bowls,  great prices for the amount of food you get. I've been a fan of this place since i lived in LA. so glad to see them in town.

try their spicy waba sauce on everything."}
{"text":"I called and put in my order over the phone for pick up and the young lady seemed to have issues getting my chicken salad with avocado and salmon bowl no rice with avocado...right. Kept repeating it and having avocado missing and seemed unsure. I picked up the order and due needing to be at the hospital for work in Phoenix...I paid and left. I check my order and NO AVOCADO on either orders and RICE in my bowl. I paid for the avocado too. Pretty upset and I work too far to call and come back. So disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is one of the beat restranut I have been too. Their food is always fresh and they have great customer service . I highly recommend trying it out. They did a great great job."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'm not a fan. I ordered the teriyaki bowl with salmon and it was so dry and lacked any flavor. My husband liked his beef teriyaki bowl though, hence the two stars. I may be a tough critic when it comes to teriyaki anything, but I know good teriyaki bowls when I taste them and this place is just meh."}
{"text":"So happy this restaurant is out here from California... Healthy option way better than anything else out here"}
{"text":"This was the worst visit to a wanna grill I have ever had. First the person behind the counter wasn't personable. Then I requested twice to have the chicken diced in small pieces, that wasn't done. Then the chicken that person put on the grill was cold, after. Good luck hope the next person has a better experience. There was one good thing about the visit there was employee that was on break she actually greeted me, then greeted me as I was leaving, I thank her for being pleasant."}
{"text":"Just tried Waba Grill for the first time and was very impressed! Great healthy fast food option."}
{"text":"The girl that puts the rice in the bowls had a band-aid on the thumb that she was handling all the food with. I politely recommended that she put a glove over that hand so that customers wouldn't be turned off by the sight of this (I was) she told me it was fine and that it was just a bandage. Not cool with me."}
{"text":"Average.  Taste like someone tried cooking it and realized it was a lost cause.  Taste like what you expect from a healthy meal.  The beef I got was a bit dry, could have been a rare case, but it was 2 orders and both were the same."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. I am on a very strict diet and the employees worked around my needs and gave great suggestions. EXCELLENT customer service and really tasty food! Great quick, inexpensive, healthy option. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I live right next to this location.  This place was amazing when they first opened and then took a deep dive on their level of service and quality after the first month. I took a break and decided to go back, I am very happy that I did. The service was outstanding, even better than when they first opened.  I am guessing the owner may have started to read these reviews and made a positive change.  The staff was motivated, attentive and very welcoming to all the customers.  Love the improvements!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner it's really good and price is not bad at all. Kinda reminds me of yogis grill. The miso soup however was not that good. But the steak and chicken was really good. My buddy had the  shrimp bowl he said nothing too special. Over all for price it's good and filling."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to having some Hawaiian style plate lunch. The teriyaki beef was chopped into little  \"cat food\" type pieces of meat, the rice was excellent but the veggies were cold and bland. The cashier was nice... Otherwise very so, so. Probably will never go back again. Too bad."}
{"text":"I'll give this three stars because I have only tried the chicken/steak plate. The chicken was pretty good. The salad is about three fork fulls, but the dressing is tasty. The \"steak\" portion was pretty nasty. Not what I was expecting at all. I paid for avocado and didn't get it with my order. :(  Pretty disappointed for my first visit, but will maybe venture back to try the chicken salad plate. Will definitely stay away from the steak."}
{"text":"Service was quick and the food options definitely felt healthier than something like McDonalds. I found myself enjoying the sides more than the actual dish but overall I was happy with my purchase. The cashiers were more than happy to help in assisting me with my order or even how the menu works altogether"}
{"text":"Food was so good and healthy. Fast, friendly service. So nice to get a easy healthy meal. They don't skimp on the avocado either. Ask for extra Teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"WaBa is awesome.  The tables could be cleaner but I really like the food.  Food is fresh and very tasty.  I like the miso."}
{"text":"So this place is good but has room for improvement. 

Pros: Healthy properly portioned food such as beef, chicken, salmon, rice or veggie bowls. I got the Salmon Plate with brown rice. It also comes with Salad with a miso style dressing and cantaloupe. 

Everything tasted good. The food is a 5 out of 5. 

I love the variety of ice tea. I tried them all and they were really good. 

Cons: So all the pictures show items on plates but they are served in plastic to go style containers. Also you order at the bar and they call your name. My complaint here is I would rather have my meal on a plastic plate like Panera and with 7 people working the building they could staff 1 person to deliver food just like Smash Burger and panera do. I know these are small gripes. 

The other thing is these are properly proportioned meals. Do not go in expecting to stuff yourself. I think they are very fairly priced for what you and you will leave full just be aware before you go. 

I personally would do them for dinner because I like a heavier lunch with a lighter dinner vs small lunch big dinner. 

Try them I think they will do well I think with a little tweaking they could be a 5 star casual dining joint."}
{"text":"Food is decent. However, I would highly recommend for people to go use their money at Ono Hawaiian Bbq. Their portions is larger and the price is around the same as Waba Grill. Both food taste great but for saving wise, go to Ono Hawaiian Bbq"}
{"text":"Really really love this place.  Simple setting, delicious food, and great service. What more do you Waba? I am absolutely addicted to their sauce, and love that I can drench my chicken bowl with it (unlike stingy competitors named Sam down the road.) Not sure what others have reviewed about the meat being too dry; umm did you not notice the giant thing of sauce by the soda fountain?  Use it!  Anyway, the flavor of the sauce puts Sam's to shame, & I will always prefer to go here when having a teriyaki craving."}
{"text":"Friend and I decided to give this place a shot.  It was a pleasant surprise.  Staff was friendly and the prices compare well to the other establishments around it.  I went with a 1/2 and 1/2 bowl which was way bigger than I thought.  Both the steak and chicken were great.  My friend went with a chicken plate and it looked delicious.  Veggies came with both and they were tasty."}
{"text":"They advertise a special I ordered the special and because it had veggies in it was charged twice the price and not told. They have poor customer service said I could have paid extra for veggies but since it was already rang up could not do very poor way of taking care of customers we won't be back nothing special here"}
{"text":"Just discovered WABA grill a few weeks ago and I'm very impressed so far! I skip breakfast most days and look to go out to eat for lunch as soon as restaurants open. By 10 am I have a very small handful of places to chose from but that's OK...I have WABA grill now! They open at 10 am!

Been twice so far and had 2 different dishes. On my 1st visit I got their WABA veggie bowl.  (I am allergic to carrots and they are heated separately from the broccoli which is why my pics aren't showing carrots..how cool is that?)  So, the WABA bowl is half beef half chicken and wow, you'd better come hungry because that was a lot of food! Kept me full until dinner easily. 

On my second visit I had their delicious salmon veggie bowl. WILD SALMON UNDER $10!! Farmed salmon isn't for me so unless I know it's wild I'm not interested. Not only is it a great price but the portion was very big (for a fish dish).  A little extra sauce and I was having the healthiest 10 am restaurant meal probably ever! It looked so good I almost forgot to take a picture. 

I like the sauce that comes on the food very much and was happy to see pumps set up so I can add even more. It makes any of the dishes I tried sweet and salty..and some days I'm sure I'll drown my meal in this liquid ambrosia! 

Love it! Can't wait to return..joined their email club and got a free drink the 1st day!"}
{"text":"Unreal how dry the meat is. Employees are filthy never using gloves. Never ever again."}
{"text":"We split a #1 which is the chicken steak plate (730 calories).  I was impressed with the size of the serving and it was easy for me and my sweetie to split and be satisfied.  The cashier was super nice (that helps)"}
{"text":"First impression-very dirty restaurant, haven't even tried the food yet, but already puts a bad taste in your mouth not knowing if the food is going to be good or how it was handled while prepared. Took my order to-go."}
{"text":"...ew. I was so excited to see this place open in AZ. I'm from Southern California and ate here religiously. I remember loving the beef plate that came with fresh fruit and a super good salad. Well, the beef was over cooked and salty, the kale salad was stale with barely no dressing, and the fresh fruit was an orange slice. Husband also disapproved. Also, the kids working in the back had long hair that wasn't pulled back or in a hat. Barely any silverware was stocked. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"So first time coming here while in PHX and I had to choose between here and Canes. I chose this place for health reasons. This place was surprisingly good and I didn't hate myself after eating a full plate I chose the specialty plate with brown rice and \"Waba\" which is chicken and steak with Teriyaki sauce.  It come with a little salad and half an orange. I just wish they had more sides but overall great place:) try it out!"}
{"text":"The service here is always great.
Food is on point !
Always clean and bright.
$6.40 for chicken and rice bowl and only $7.20 for steak??? Not a bad deal.

Make sure to some extra wanna sauce or soy sauce"}
{"text":"Today was there Grand Opening. Been there twice already :) So far I've tried there chicken and steak plate and there ribs plate. I was impressed with both of them. Definitely a healthier alternative compared to many other restaurants. Service have been great both times, they care very much for customer experience. I'll be back for more Ribs on my next trip, maybe I'll try the shrimp as well. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"The people that work here are very friendly and immediately greet you and make you feel welcome. We had the waba signature plate and it was delicious. Their ice tea is refreshing as well. Price is less than eating lunch at Chipotle. Will be coming back here for sure..."}
{"text":"Apparently an hour and twenty minutes before close is when the people here start treating you like you're there too late and they are about to close.... completely out of green onions in the condiment bar, better than 70% of the tables still had tiny remnants of other patrons dinner... they were out of iced tea and two of the soda fountain drinks were down when my girlfriend inquired I literally watched the cashier be told not to make iced tea.... I have been a frequenter of Waba for years, can't say I'll be coming back to this one. I work in customer service and I hate being this person but it's just a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"I've had Waba Grill about 3-4 times a week back home in California LOVED IT. But for some reason every time I order a chicken bowl here I always seem to be biting just \"Fat\" the first few times I came here I figured it was just those few times but no. I eat chicken and rice every day at home but I like to switch it up every now and then and I have not had the best experience here. Also, the staff is not too welcoming at all."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I ordered a plate which costs 9 dollars. They gave me literally a small side of salad like not even a cup and two very small pieces of fruit FOR 9 DOLLARS. They need to work on their portions. I hate this place"}
{"text":"The staff is RUDE .. Always playing around and ignoring you until they are finished with their conversation.. They ALWAYS forget the avacado so I have to always check it before I leave .. Other than that the food is good but the staff is horrible"}
{"text":"I was here 2 nights ago with my dad & his girlfriend; my dad & I got the beef short ribs specialty plates (they came with a kale salad & cantaloupe)...I LOVED everything! Fresh, fantastic-tasting, plus the young lady and her colleague who helped us were very patient, knowledgeable and friendly (my wheelchair-bound dad's going through chemo & radiation treatments at Mayo Clinic so he was somewhat out of it that night due to some of his pain meds). Anyway, I loved the food and service plus the very cool music playing overhead! I was just wondering, though, why they kept their outside marquee light off? They should have it on real bright so other folks can find the restaurant and experience their awesome, healthy, tasty food!!!!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed. We came in hoping to have a relatively heathy meal and to try a new restaurant. We were disappointed to find the food very underwhelming. I had the Waba Plate. The chicken was dry, and the beef was full of fat/grizzle and dry as well. However, the service was good and the store was clean. I will most-likely not be returning.

Oh, and their \"sauce bar\" was only two ketchup pumps. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Decent food but they ran out of veggies when I was here. Other than that staff was friendly, even brought our food to the table. The unsweetened tea is also really good!"}
{"text":"How this place says open is beyond me!  It's always empty and tonight I stop in again (because it's next to Home Depot) to order a simple white meat chicken dinner platter.  However, get this ... they were out of white meat and this is the 2nd time!!!  The last time I went in I heard the guy in back say \"we are out of white meat\" but then my order came up.  Brought it home ... dark meat.  Yes, stupid me tried it again as their was NO WAY it would happen again.  This place will be closed soon."}
{"text":"I always get the salmon bowl with avocado and its always so delicious. They have shrimp, steak and tofu to choose from too. It's healthy food that fills you up and tastes great.  This location is really nice, clean and has good music playing! The staff is welcoming and friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First of all the lady that served me snatched my card out of my hand, to swipe it. Secondly I asked for a teriyaki chicken plate thinking I'd get a lot of food for the amount of money I spent. Instead I get the same amount of food that's in a bowl, just with watermelon and 2 pieces of lettuce on the side. And last but not least I didn't get any teriyaki sauce with it, like I asked. Thats the first and last time I'm giving WaBa Grill a chance. Should've walked over to in n out where it was poppin'."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is very friendly and works together well as a team. The restaurant is new and clean. I can't get over how perfectly they slice their avocados; swoon.

I love their salmon and Waba plates.
It's awesome that the plates come with cantaloupe and kale salad- yay for Vitamin A and K.

Thank you Waba Grill =]"}
{"text":"I got the chicken bowl that is the $5 lunch special and came with a 22 oz drink.. Well first off their soda machine was out so you got water or brewed tea which tastes like it was old! Then the chicken needed to be cooked longer.. I don't think it was raw but there were a few pieces I didn't eat.. The staff is also rude. Before leaving a lady complained about the soda machine and the lady got snarky with her.. I can say this will be my last visit to this particular location!"}
{"text":"Positive: I love Waba Grill because it is not just semi-convenient but tasty healthy food.

Negative: Never answer the phone for take-out. Bad customer service and un-cleanly."}
{"text":"Happened to be on the westside of the valley and got off the 101 and Mcdowell to get some lunch only to find this place: what a great find! Tried the half-half bowl with no rice extra veggies and fell in love with the taste of the steak.  Now whenever I get a chance to get on this side of town I stop by for the steak bowl no rice or added sauce and extra veggies.  Have to pay .35 extra for all veggies but simply love the crunchy veggies and can do without rice.  They offer chicken, salmon, and shrimp options as well.  So wish there was a WaBa grill on the east side of the valley! Good thing I have family out here and get chances to stop by every once in a while."}
{"text":"Incredibly underwhelmed by this \"healthy \" fast food restaurant. The standard is a white rice chicken or steak bowl. If you want to pay more, you can get veggies, white meat, and brown rice. Sugary teriyaki sauce is all over the bowl. It would have been okay and I would have rated it as 3 stars if it didn't advertise itself as healthy. My husband got the steak plate, and the fat wasn't even trimmed off. Again, brown rice and lots of veggies should be the standard at a \"healthy\" restaurant like this. Otherwise, the chicken was dry and there could have been more sauce options at the \"sauce bar\". I feel lied to."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this one.  I had high hopes for it and was really really really hoping to fall in love with this place.  Nothing against the employees here or the restaurant itself but the taste just didn't do it for me.  

The reason I had high hopes for this place was because everyone always talks about it on YouTube.  There are some that eat this every single day in the Vlogs.  So I thought I'd give them a try.  Yes the quality of the food is miles above fast food but the taste just didn't do it for me.  It was \"ok\" at best.  Had the waba plate which included rice with chicken and beef, side salad and some sliced watermelon.  Chicken was good but the beef seemed kinda dry.  Almost like a wet jerky texture.  They do offer salmon, steak, and short ribs which I might have to try next time and re-evaluate but for now my curiosity has been \"fed\"."}
{"text":"Good flavor,  way over cooked chicken and steak,  beef jerky consistency.  Will give it another shot but they need to work on the grill skills!"}
{"text":"I have Never asked for money back on an order or complained but this was the place that pushed me over the edge. It not only looked seriously awful but the customer service was awful. I would literally rather cut my dick off and put teriyaki flavored cat piss on it and eat it than go here again."}
{"text":"Good quality & delicious chicken, steak & white rice. Veggies and Kale salad is good too!"}
{"text":"So excited there's a Waba in Arizona now!!! We have them all over Southern California and it's a great place to eat healthy. Now that we are out here every other month I know where I'll be eating. Simple menu, great price and the staff here is awesome and friendly. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from southern California so when I found out they had a WaBa grill in Phoenix i had to make a stop! Honestly the best WaBa grill I've had. Can't go wrong with the Chicken veggie bowl with avocado. Chicken was perfect.. Not dried out (like it just came off the grill) inside was very clean and modern. Employees were kind and accommodating to my hot sauce needs :D.  Defintely well be back the next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this new place, as it is right around the corner from us, and we are always looking for healthy places to eat.  We were disappointed in more ways than one.

-We called ahead to place an order, including a Salmon Rice Bowl, Steak Rice Bowl, and a kids Chicken Bowl for our 7 year old.  When we went to pick it up, we tried to use a BOGO coupon for our son's bowl, but said it only was valid for a regular Chicken Bowl, not the kids bowl.  So basically if I we order the bigger bowl it is free, but the kids bowl isn't?  We were told their \"register couldn't handle it\".  Furthermore the employee we dealt with was pretty clueless about it and made no offer to try to accomdate us.

-We also specifically requested our son's Chicken to be plain, but when we got home found it was slathered in Teryaki.  So they clearly can't handle any custom order.

-As for the food itself, both the steak and salmon were overcooked (better then undercooked, but still) and the rice was dry as well.  

If their staff had been more helpful or understanding of our situation we would give them another try, but combining that with medicore food will definitely keep us away.  There are much better options to grab a quick healthy meal."}
{"text":"Meh. Two friends and I ate here and found it... Mediocre at best. There wasn't near enough sauce and almost no flavor. Nothing was bad per se, but I felt like I was just eating to fill my stomache and not to actually enjoy the food. I've had much better, more enjoyable, and more filling for for the same price and will be sticking to those places in the future"}
{"text":"Wish they had a bigger variety of veggies other than just carrots and broccoli. Also half an avacado is an extra $2 charge.

Rice and Veggie bowl was a decent portion for $5.50 though. Could have made it at home for half the price either way. 

Tofu is cooked in the same grill as all the meat, so we couldn't even have that. 

The \"WaBa Sauce\" (teriyaki) is vegan. 

If you are in a super pinch and want litterally steamed rice, steamed carrots, and steamed broccoli for $5.50 then this is the spot."}
{"text":"Young man and lady here today were very polite and made my order fresh very quickly. The portion was good also, very pleased with my lunch. I also had a question. About the food because I'm on a diet and she answered the questions very well"}
{"text":"The time on my receipt is 8:06 pm. At 8:52, we finally received our food, and it wasn't even hot. Warm... at best. I guess we came at a time when they ran out of all meats. I know it's cooked to order, but 45 minutes to get a rice bowl is insane. Never again."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.   I Didn't leave loving it.    The service was great.  The place looks nice and clean. However , the chicken was dry, the steak was dry, and the rice was dry.  The kale salad was one scoop big.  The meal overall was a little expensive for what it was, and I can only compare the quality to Panda Express."}
{"text":"Recently went to WaBa and fell in love with their food. It was our first time there and the employees were all so helpful and wonderful. 

As someone who enjoys eating meat with no veggies blocking the way, I appreciate the \"bowl\" they offer. Bowls come with a choice of meat and nice and no veggies. The plate does come with veggies for those that want it. 

Amazing! Reasonable pricing for a whole lotta meat in the bowl. I am an avid lover of chicken teriyaki, but when I tried there \"WaBa\" which is their steak, I immediately fell in love and changed my order to steak and chicken teriyaki aka the WaBa Bowl combo.

Go try their steak! It's soo good!"}
{"text":"All in all pretty good.  I like to explore new places, so was happy to check it out.  I had the WaBa bowl, which is half chicken, half beef.  The serving is a generous size.  Both meats were flavorful and tender.  The sauces in the pumps on the side were both great as well.  The spicy one really has a nice kick.  I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We like the food a lot but we have had to call out the kids working there multiple times because we watch them handle money and then not wash their hands before going to handle the food. If this wasn't a common issue this would easily be four stars."}
{"text":"Went here once when they opened.  Meh.  I didn't think it was worth going back.  Hopefully they fixed the front door by now."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Saturday afternoon recently. The restaurant was not busy, and iur food was ready pretty quickly. We ordered the steak and chicken combo waba bowl, and chicken waba bowl. It was tasty, and I just wished it came with some veggies.  The servings are huge! It was enough for me to have lunch the next day."}
{"text":"We have gone three times and the food has been fresh and good consistently.  We have only ordered the bowls  and they are very filling so I cannot comment on the plates.  I particularly like the salmon.  Can't beat the price and it is a generous serving.  You can help yourself to their sauce which is a plus because many times these types of places serve dishes that are on the dry side.  The staff has always been friendly and efficient.  I frequently see policemen in there which is a plus because that means they are comfortable in the surroundings and the food is good.  We will be frequent visitors of WaBa Grill because it is reasonable, fresh and friendly."}
{"text":"Had to try WaBa Grill after seeing all the good reviews!
When we went in, the guy at the register was very friendly and shared some info about WaBa's meats and gave us some recommendations too, which was appreciated. I ordered the Half-Half Bowl (steak & chicken) with white rice. They had 3 different tea choices and I went with the Passion Fruit Black Tea, which was good. Tried a little Coconut Pineapple Green Tea too, which was also not bad.
My first bite into the chicken I bit down on a hard piece of tendon. Not a good way to start! I was hoping that would be the end of it, but there were at least a couple more tendon-y pieces in there that I had to spit out. And it wasn't just mine. My b/f had some in his too. What a junky cut of meat! I don't know if they trim the meat back there or if it comes pre-trimmed, but those people need to learn how to do it properly. I was also unimpressed with the steak as I really didn't like the heavy char on it (was almost like eating charcoal at times) and it had some inedible gristle as well... Lost my appetite about halfway through. :(
I had such high hopes for WaBa, but I was very disappointed in the food. Based on this experience, I would much rather go to Yogi's for a good teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"Perfect for when you want something yummy and sauce-y but don't want to be completely unhealthy. Good sauces ! I get the waba plate and substitute the kale salad for steamed veggies. Really good!"}
{"text":"Have you ever had Samurai Sams? Well if you did and liked it it, then you would like Waba. I like Samurai Sams 4 stars worth and since they are similar I'll give Waba a 4 also.  No further comments.  Thank you"}
{"text":"I'm hoping I came here on an off day because everyones reviews looked good. However the woman's bathroom was broken so I took my son to the men's restroom. The bathroom was dirty I don't know if the floor was wet because of water or urine. The toilet seat had splatter of some kind it was just awful unfortunately, I felt dirty coming out of that restroom. Sat down the tables were sticky. The food was cold to room temp the rice was hard. It's too bad the chicken had good flavor the food was affordable. Two WaBa plates with drinks will cost 22 and change. Everything else was disappointing I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there this morning a few hours later he has food poisoning and a fever. The chicken was hard and burnt. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the half-half (chicken/steak) and chicken bowl. We both thought the food was decent; wished there were veggies on the side to balance out the meal. But you can order a veggie bowl, although we didn't want to spend an extra $5/6 for it. I also wished they didn't put their sauce on top, it was a bit too much- I would have rather liked to put it on myself.

They're portions are big, so if you want a quick healthy meal to fill you up - GO HERE."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place thought it to be like a samurai sams or yoshis. But , it was not anything like it. Lacks tons of flavor portions are very little. I forked out 10.00 for literally 7 bites of meat. Not a fan and will not return. I will stick with the reputable teriyaki bowls joints in Phoenix.

Place sucks if you think this was good you don't know any better.."}
{"text":"Antonio is very helpful and provides great customer service. I will keep coming here because of this locations amazing employees. Who ever is training these employees on customer service needs to give themselves a round of applause. The food here is amazing as well. Best WaBa grill in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Aftrer several repeat visits the place is trending in the wrong direction from what feels like very lazy & uninvolved ownership. 

The place is understaffed constantly, I visit Waba during lunch hours & during late dinner hours right before they close. And it's the same young lady there busting her ass  with their random cook doing their best to keep up with the steady stream of customers, phone orders, & online mobile app orders. 

A management or ownership figure is never to be seen at the location. 

Wait times have gotten excessive. 
The place needs background music, waiting 15-20 minutes for your fast casual food with others amid nothing but kitchen sounds and communication of a stressed out 2 person staff, creates an awkwardness that customers shouldnt have to experience. 

Please Waba Franchise owner, invest in your staff & your location. Don't be another failed Waba experiment in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"I have made several visits to this location and this last visit finally made me post this. I love the food, but this location hires the worst employees I've ever seen... they have ZERO urgency or customer service skills. Wait times are beyond acceptable.  I agree with previous posts about lack of management involvement and I will never visit location again."}
{"text":"Just went to WaBa Grill with my boyfriend for lunch. The restaurant was completely empty which seemed weird to me. The cashiers were nice and helpful with suggesting items because I was a first-timer, I ended up getting a Chicken/Steak Rice and Veggie Bowl. The food wasn't anything spectacular. Veggies were slightly undercooked. The chicken was good but the steak was sub-par. If I go back I will probably get a Chicken and Rice Bowl, but this will not be my first choice for lunch options."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed this place has only been opened a few months and the first month or so it was really good & provided healthy means options ,but the last several times has not even been edible!!!  We ordered the wabba bowl which is 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef and I took a bite of the chicken and it tasted like it was spoiled so I tried the beef and that tasted like it had been kept with the salmon !!! Not sure if I will ever go back again if I do it will be serval months"}
{"text":"Oh the goodness, wish they added a bit more to their bowls and a longer time on the grill, but for the price, it's not too bad ^.^"}
{"text":"Underwhelming, unfortunately.  I had the Chicken plate-and as one other reviewer noted-it was slim pickins.  The entree was paired with two bites of Kale Salad with seemingly no dressing-and an orange slice.  I will give it another try and go with the bowl the next time.  Crossing my fingers!"}
{"text":"We were happy to see a new restaurant open up I our area however this place is just \"meh\".  I had their chicken plate which is served with all dark meat. I feel the menu should state that the chicken served is all dark meat. The plate comes with a side of kale salad but apparently you have to ask for dressing. There was no offering of types of dressing they had or any out by the condiment station. For someone getting take out I think they should be telling customers that the salad is served dry and a dressing should be offered. Overall, everything was just plain tasting. It's not worth the money. I would be shocked if this place makes it a year here."}
{"text":"Meh... not what I was hoping. Small portions high price. They were out of the steak when i came. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great place for a tasty rice bowl. The Waba plate is the perfect streak/chicken mixture and everything is pretty well priced for the quality of meat and size of the portions. If you're a big eater like me, I'd recommend getting extra meat on one of the plates (rather than a bowl)."}
{"text":"First time here. Told the gal at the order desk it wa our first time here. Instead of asking if we had any questions or explaining the menu, she asked the next person in line to order. We ordered by the numbers on their menu. Both orders came out wrong."}
{"text":"Found a Waba grill out in Arizona great healthy food  after a hard workout. They have all the protein you need. Just on the corner of McDowell. I usually just get their chicken and brown rice with some vegetables. Trying to eat lean this year. I will certainly become a regular at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood WaBa Grill!  Good food, good service, and a decent price. I had the WaBa Plate with brown rice, steak, chicken, and the kale salad. Tasty!"}
{"text":"This place was very delicious, especially for someone looking for a delicious meal that can fit into your healthy meal plans. They served the freshest kale I've ever had and Angelina had great attitude and awesome customer service, so was everyone else, I wish everyone came here to try it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my rice bowl.  The meat was just a little bit too sweet."}
{"text":"New rice bowl place with plates and salads. The bowl actually has more food than the plate which the plate cost more. 

According to the photo, the plate meals are on a flat plate and looks like alot of food compared to a bowl.

We ordered a bowl with vegetables with Teriyaki Chicken and a Plate with Dark Meat Teriyaki Chicken with salad.

When the meals came, the bowl was as expected, but the plate actually was in a 3 section take out carton which the one small compartment had a salad which was not tasty and the other small section had a slice of orange. This left the large section which was half of the carton of rice and Teriyaki Chicken which was seemed less food than a rice bowl but cost more. 

The food was actually pretty good with the exception of the salad, the Teriyaki Chicken was good and my daughter liked it better than a competitor. 

My suggestion is to not order the plate meal but go for the bowl which is cheaper in cost but seemed to get you more food than the plate meal."}
