{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast excellent service and the food above average.  The place is very nice and comfortable. The waiter kept my coffee cup filled without me having to ask. The prices very reasonable. We came back for a late lunch. Once again the food and service  were excellent. Food portions are generous and appealing. The waiter kept my water glass filled and removed dishes as soon as we were done. In both ocasiones the bill arrived promptly. A very nice place!"}
{"text":"We wanted something somewhat quick and thought this cafe would be good.  There was about a 5-10 min wait for a table and we were seated with a really good view of the pool area.  Then it went downhill from there.  

It took forever to put in a drink order and then once we got it, the drinks weren't even right.  We ordered 3 mimosas and one bloody mary and she brought 2 bloody marys and 2 mimosas, except the mimosas were just champagne.  

Once we ordered our food, it took forever to get the food!!!  Then when she did bring it, she gave some of our things to another table and then we had to wait for her to bring out new stuff!!  Even through all of that, the food was just ok.  I would just avoid this place and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"They are very friendly and efficient. But the food can only be described as mediocre, and definitely not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Good price goos buffet. If you are an mlife member  you het 5.00 bucks off each dinner buffet. Its a little annoying though how they stopped serving primerib and stopped putting out crab legs and they were going to put out only flank steak. a little disappointing. I dod like the all you can eat made to order pasta bar. You could make your  own yummy pasta. The dessets were lacking big time though don't go for the desserts. If you like beer champagne and wine you can get an all you can drink add on for 7.99 not bad."}
{"text":"The Cafe looked nice but we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. Once seated we noticed that the restaurant was half empty.

The menu was impressive. Too bad the food didn't match. The food was just below average. There are many other places to eat that would have been better."}
{"text":"Although the wait staff is friendly in general, your experience can vary considerably on the basis of time of day (can be very busy) or your server (sometimes they just seem to disappear while you wait).  All in all the food is well prepared and tasty when you get it, but I would not recommend it unless you are with a big crowd that can keep you entertained while you wait an interminable while for your food.  Sometimes we arrive for a late breakfast, and by the time our food arrives, it feels like we should have ordered lunch instead.  In fact the last time I was there, that is what I did!  Very pleasant setting and nice selection, just not any thing special."}
{"text":"I had an hour for breakfast.  My $17.00 omelette came out 55 minutes later.  COLD.  There were few people in the restaurant, and still service was s-l-o-w.  I ran to the bathroom about 30 minutes later.  Denny's is better, faster, less gastronomically risky."}
{"text":"Kinda has that kitchen nightmares vibe. Dining room was huuuge and the place was nearly deserted. I honestly don't know how places in Vegas can survive when not backed by a big name chef. They must pay a fortune in rent for the size of this space; doubt they are making money. 

We had 30 minutes for breakfast before our conference which is why we ducked in. Server told us not to order the shrimp and grits breakfast. Just silently shook her head \"no\" and then said \"I like for people to order things I won't have to take back.\" Believe me, we appreciated that from the server. But yeah. Kitchen nightmares. 

I had the huevos rancheros and it was good. Just not Vegas good. You expect so much more from the food scene in this town. This dish was basic. My buddy had the smores pancakes and did not complain. 

Not worth it when there are amazing restaurants all over the place. Will probably be closed by the time you go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was much better than I expected.   Prices are what you should expect for Vegas..  breakfast for two,,,   $60 including tip.  Service was mediocre,  but acceptable.   Understanding were not in a 5 star restaurant...  would we go again,,,   yeah.  Like I said,,,   food was really good!"}
{"text":"The cafe has nice view of the pool area. The staff is friendly and helpful. I'd give it 4 stars but the food is just average, not very tasty. Too much hash brown and omelet is not a wise choice. I like the sea breeze cocktail instead. My brother got the steak. It didn't look so appealing and neither did the taste. Another wrong choice. I hope you have better luck than me."}
{"text":"We decided to go to this cafe because of its location. The wait time was misleading. They took my name down at the host desk and 15-20 minutes later they walked us in. I thought it would be to sit down, but they just took us to another room to wait in for another 15 minutes or so. We were getting ready to leave when they called my name to sit us down. Once we ordered the food things started to move a bit faster. The food was good, nothing special.  The coffee was also good. It was obvious that they were not expecting to get super busy as it seemed they were understaffed. 

Overall better than Dennys or Ihop but double the price."}
{"text":"A bad start was waiting more than 10 minutes for the first visit by the server.  It wasn't busy, I just felt invisible until I asked the worker that had brought me water to please send my server.  A server that clearly wasn't assigned to my table came and took my order - there had been plenty of time to decide - but it was a different woman that brought my check later; I presume that my first interaction with my server was when she brought my check.  The corned beef hash and poached eggs were good, and seemed a good value.  But I can't recommend it with such a poor level of service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is conveniently placed in the Mandalay Bay Resort, however, I thought it was a little over priced for the quality of food, even in a casino. I payed $20 for a plate of corned beef hash when I could have gone next door to the buffet and eating all I wanted for $5 more for the same quality food. The hash was not even that good which was disappontinf"}
{"text":"While staying at the Mandalay Bay we had so many restaurant options it was crazy. The day we  were scheduled to leave, we decided to check out the Seabreeze Cafe. The cafe menu posted outside looked like they had a variety of sandwiches, salads and burgers and were advertising a lunch special and it seemed reasonable at $12.95. The front desk sat us right away, as I think we came after the breakfast crowd and just before lunch. The restaurant itself is huge....we were walked towards the back end of the restaurant that looks over the Four Seasons pool; it was a nice sunny day and enjoyed the view. We had more than one server and both were very attentive. We ordered the lunch special which was the BLT with fries and the coconut shrimp which was an appetizer. Both meals came out quickly and were hot and delish. Prices were very reasonable and service gets an A+."}
{"text":"Service was very lackluster. Our server, Denise, was so unattentive that we had to flag down another waiter to get her to bring us our check, because she was always looking elsewhere so we couldn't flag her down directly. She also spilled hot coffee right on my knee. The food was also lackluster, large portions but lukewarm and bland. My party ordered three American Breakfasts that all showed up lukewarm. The pancakes were tough and hard to cut, let alone chew. and I had a pulled pork sandwich that was supposed to have coleslaw. If you can count like 10 shreds of cabbage as coleslaw. The bbq sauce was bland, and the pork wasn't pulled, it was closer to diced. Would not recommend, even to my enemies."}
{"text":"Mediocre restaurant. 

The service was good. A front desk hostess calls to the back to keep your table then you walk down a long beautiful hallway which is maybe 100 feet. The waitress was attentive and quick to fill your water and coffee. 4 stars for service. 

Aesthetically this is a beautiful restaurant. It's a mix of rustic wooden architecture, lots of natural lighting with pretty views, and 70s music in the background that isn't too loud so you can still hear your table concertos. 4 stars for the looks. 

The food was simply not good. It tastes like you were eating at an Applebee style restaurant where nothing is fresh, everything was frozen, and now it's been under a heat lamp. Our coconut shrimp had no flavor and was served at room temperature. The Cuban sandwich was also devoid of flavor and the meats has a rubbery taste. Everything was also overpriced. The coffee was surprisingly excellent, but they charged 5.50 for a cup of coffee so it better be excellent! Food and value 2 stars. 

Food: 2 stars
Value: 2 stars
Ambiance: 4 stars
Service: 4 stars

Total: 3 stars"}
{"text":"I was dining by myself and waited over 10 min. for someone to even acknowledge me. She was not working my section but I told her I had been waiting so she took my order and gave it to my server. She then walked by and couldn't believe my food had not been delivered because \"she had fixed it for her\". My food was finally delivered by my server who was not friendly. I was there in business and was in a hurry. I had to sit my card out and she finally came back by to check on me. I ordered yogurt with granola and a side of bacon. The fruit was old and not fresh and the bacon was cold. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Other reviewers here have this nailed...a lovely space inside the Mandalay Bay hotel, but a very average (and expensive) place to eat breakfast.

I ordered a \"standard fare\" breakfast plate of over-easy eggs, toast, hash browns, coffee and a side of bacon.  Everything on the plate was okay, except the potatoes were not done enough based on my request.  Coffee was on the weaker side.

The seating area is mammoth and the outside views made for a pleasant experience, but for the price I will probably go elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"The breakfast special was good and priced cheap. Ordering anything else is expensive. $5 for a cup of coffee? Bacon and OJ overpriced as well. I know it's a hotel and all, but geez."}
{"text":"I had the quiche and wouldn't order it again. It didn't taste fresh (made in the past 24 hours) and there was too much crust and not enough filling. Strangely, it was garnished with leaves of spinach like they were making a quiche salad.

I looked around the room and there appeared to be meals I'd order instead of the quiche so I give it two stars instead of an outright fail."}
{"text":"This Mandalay Bay restaurant was conveniently located in our hotel so my hubby & I came here for breakfast. I had previously reviewed their menu online & wanted to try the whole wheat pancakes with berry compote & citrus mascarpone. The ambiance is lovely with lots of light coming through the large windows, comfortable seating & friendly wait staff. The pancake breakfast was no disappointment; it was delicious, although the chicken apple sausage side that I ordered was a little rubbery. All in all, I'd still recommend this place for any meal."}
{"text":"Service was very very slow. I didn't think I'd be sitting around in this place for so long. Shouldn't they serve you water as soon as you're seated?? Food was so-so. The chicken fried steak was a bit too salty. The biscuits and gravy were delicious and my eggs were cooked properly, and the breading on the meat actually stayed kinda sorta crispy but in the end that piece of meat was way too salty."}
{"text":"If only I could give negative stars. We arrived at 830. There was no line and no one waiting to be seated. We were about to be seated, then the section we were to be seated in was to be closed. We were told it would be a few minutes. Hostesses (3 of them) walking back and forth following each other, looking very clueless. We ended up waiting 40minutes while 12 other tables got  seated (including a table of 5, we were 6)  even though we asked \"what about us?\" When we finally got a table, we saw that half the tables were empty (tables of 4), many of which could have been pushed together to seat us. No one who worked there cared. Our small kids were starving and nearly inconsolable by the time we sat down. We should have left to eat somewhere else, but were worried there would be additional wait since we already waited so long that it was now busy everywhere. Waitress was fast, at least. But food was barely warm, portions tiny (are we in Vegas???), and not very good. Skip this crap and go to the buffet instead. You'll pay $5 more per person in the end, but food and service will be better."}
{"text":"Loved eating here for breakfast when we stayed at Mandalay Bay!  I had S'mores pancakes and it was delicious!   

Our waitress was super fast so we could make it to our timed appointments in the morning and she was really nice!  We ate here twice it was great for breakfast!"}
{"text":"If the extended wait times and competency of the staff are to reflect the amount of time I will have to wait for my bottomless mimosa to be refilled, I may want to rethink my drink order. Maybe they need new management or at least better time management skills. This place is over staffed and not busy AT ALL. 1 star... and I haven't even had my food yet."}
{"text":"Great views of the pool, but that's all you get for your money. Service was slow and food was overpriced for the quality they put out from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Not very good food. A bit disorganized due to being very understaffed. Quiche was bone dry. Do not recommend it at all."}
{"text":"Very mediocre breakfast. I've had better Omelets at Denny's. For $20 an omelette I would expect better. The coffee was decent at least. Usual hotel fare that overpriced and underwhelming"}
{"text":"We were seated right away, no wait time at 7:30am. ;)
Our server was awesome, she was quick, but not overwhelming. Our food was good and price was decent. This is Vegas, nothing is affordable breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way out of Vegas and have to say they're pretty good.  Spacious inside with restrooms right at the entrance and it's very bright inside.  We tried the pancakes which were what you'd expect, the omelettes I heard are good and I had the crab cakes which were satisfying.  Minus 1 star because my friend said the water wasted funny but I didn't taste anything different."}
{"text":"Dålig service, dålig mat och dåliga råvaror, så skulle man att kunna sammanfatta Seabreeze Cafe. Det tog väldigt lång tid att få prata med servitrisen och att få maten, som när den kom var extremt undermålig. 

Vi beställde pannkakor och müsli med bär och en av bären var mögligt, och pannkakan var torr och osmaklig. Lägg sedan till att müslin och yoghurten var dränkt i socker (vilket ej framgick i menyn).

Priserna var inte billiga heller utan man betalar enbart för att få äta inne på hotellet och bekvämligheten, precis allt annat spar de in på. Det är lönt att gå till ett annat hotell och hitta ordentlig mat när du ändå betalar ordentliga matpriser."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and it was just alright.  The service was great, but the food was subpar, especially considering its central location in the hotel.  The decor is very nice, but don't let that fool you into thinking that the food will be good.  It was alright.

I had oatmeal, and it was pretty standard.  Most of my party did the breakfast special, and it didn't look all that great to me."}
{"text":"This is a casual diner type place. The dining room was nice and spacious. The service was polite to our party of 4 but I asked for a napkin a never got. Oh well. 


The food is super mediocre. My inlaws liked their sandwiches but my $18 Asian chicken salad was disgusting. The chicken was grey, chewy and inedible. I had to pick it out. 

Eating in the casino isn't cheap but this isn't the most pricy place. Best for breakfast."}
{"text":"We always have breakfast in the hotel.  The old restaurant was Raffles.  A little pricy but always good.  Raffles was replaced with a new restaurant called Seabreeze Cafe.  The hostess said just a name change.  Had to wait about 10 minutes for a table which is not too bad.  However, there were plenty of open tables when we were seated.  It looked like they were short of help.  Finally served and have to say the food was so sub par.  No taste to it.  We both ate less than half our breakfast.  Asked to speak to manager which we did.  We told him how we felt and he said he would talk to the chef.  He did nothing for us about the bill.  As a matter of fact he really did not seem very interested in our comments."}
{"text":"Seabreeze Cafe is beautiful. Despite the high price point, their food is average at best and their lattes are the worst. I came here for breakfast because I had free breakfast and dining credits to spend at Mandalay Bay. I tried their eggs benedict, chicken fried steak, belgium waffle, bagel and smoked salmon, and their iced lattes. The two dishes I'd recommend is the chicken fried steak and the bagel and smoked salmon. Everything else was just a-ok. Don't get the lattes here unless you like those generic tasting lattes from those old timey coffee machines. The total for our bill was almost $90!"}
{"text":"The server was phenomenal, she was friendly and kind. However, the kitchen would not allow changes to be made to menu items. The food was extremely over priced for the lack of quality. The drinks were good and fairly priced. I am disappointed that this was our first meal in Vegas. There are hundreds of other restaurants, try one of them."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at this cafe. We came here on a Friday morning for breakfast. They are way understaffed so the wait to be seated is long. And then when we were seated, the waitress was nowhere. Wasn't her fault. She was doing too much. They just don't have enough staff. 
We ordered traditional breakfast. Eggs, hash browns, toast, pancakes, turkey bacon, coffee and orange juice. 
The OJ was fresh queened and perfect. Coffee was ok. Eggs were ok. Hash browns were horrible. I asked for well done. She said they don't do that. I didn't touch them. The turkey bacon was still frozen. Went untouched as well. The toast was ok. 
I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend stayed at the Delano which is connected to the Mandalay Bay for our anniversary. Me being lazy (and were locals) I didn't feel like driving out of the hotel so I said lets just eat in the hotel (I should have just drove lol) We spent a couple minutes looking on Yelp and came to agreement on this restaurant.

We get here, we got seated promptly, waitress quickly came over to take our drinks. The inside is really nice I like the decor, it was very upscale to me. As we were overlooking the menu, I noticed the prices were really high, 18$ for a regular burger ( I know we're on the strip but damn!) 

I ordered the burger 18$
My girlfriend ordered the steak frites 27$ (really chewy steak)


Pros:
- Clean restaurant 
- nice and friendly staff 

Cons:
-Very, very average food
- The price was insanely high for how average the food was.
-my girlfriend had hair on the butter of her steak frites, the restaurant is lucky she's so nice about those kinda things. 


My advice, just don't eat here. Plenty of other and better cheap options you just have to drive to get to them."}
{"text":"If you're craving a delicious, yet simple breakfast and do not feel like visiting the buffet, I highly recommend Seabreeze Café. We met my fiancé's family here one morning just as we were about to hit the road to go back to LA. It's nothing fancy, it's nothing special, but the breakfast is delicious. We got the all American breakfast and split it. The portions are definitely large enough to do so and it's a bit on the pricey side so it's worth it financially to maybe split with your partner. Otherwise, you will definitely have leftovers. The service was a little slow to the draw at first and then they realized that we were kind of in a rush and picked things up."}
{"text":"Nothing special, nothing terrible. 

Huge restaurant and we were maybe 1 of 10 tables seated. It seemed to get busier during lunch. 

We had brunch. Staff was sorta kinda attentive. Had bottomless mimosas but... waiter came around only once to refill when I swear j could've had 5-6 refills. Lame. 

Food is ok, just expect a long wait after ordering."}
{"text":"Lovely breakfast from Karen who was a gem and made a good meal great. Her manager Ralph knows how to treat his customers and employees well and it shows. Thank you for a terrific experience and tasty healthy food!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food and I bumped it down a star being that a hotel like this should know better. It's an insult to compare this place to Denny's. For those traveling on a budget I'd go off the strip and pay for a taxi if you're looking for a breakfast deal. The cost of doing that would be the same if not less than this garbage food.

On a plus note the coffee was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to the buffet if you're looking for a good filling breakfast at a much better price. Great food (loved the eggs Benedict), good coffee, excellent service. Mandalay Bay has been through some substantial renovations in the past couple years and they certainly didn't leave this place out; beautiful decor in a very elegant cabana-style with a cozy beachside atmosphere. Really enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"Wow this was just bad! To start, espresso machine broke down so all they had was coffee. Really!? You're a cafe, find a backup espresso machine. Quiche was super dry. It was as if it had been left in the refrigerator for 3 days before it was reheated. The crab cake was over cooked. Vegetables that came with the benedicts was soggy.

Overall: don't come here!"}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times as it is the quickest and most reliable option in the morning for Mandalay Bay.  A nice big variety of guilty pleasures, this year I had the sugar bomb pancakes including the Smores and the Snickerdoodle (the first I couldn't finish due to saturation, the second I had to scrape the piles of sugar off the top a little as not to overdose).  Sounds crazy but it is JUST what you need after a Vegas night.  The service is nice and attentive if it isn't overcrowded.  Like everything in Vegas it's about 30% more than you would pay for the same quality elsewhere but that's part of the expectation.  I like how it's very spread out with a lot of dividers so you feel like you have your own little space but can still people watch"}
{"text":"What an awesome place! This was our first time going to this establishment and I was certainly impressed. I had the chicken Asian salad and the bottomless mimosas. My salad was HUGE and oh so delicious. I literally couldn't stop eating because it was so good. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was so friendly. Our waiter was awesome, he was bringing me mimosas without me even having to ask. They were so good. My better half had the greek salad and the chicken strips. He was very pleased with his meal as well. 
Next time I go here, I am for sure going to order one of their bloody marys. I saw a few people having them and they looked like a meal in itself.
I would highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"the break was delish... 
it was a lil to cold in there.
I ate my food
I went to the pool party."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at this place. For a party of 2, we waited 30 minutes at a table for no service at all. No drink order, no food order. After 30 minutes, a lady cleaning tables saw our annoyed look and brought over waters. We left and it is apparent that the management of this restaurant does not care about service. Maybe the manager of food and beverage for the hotel does???"}
{"text":"Service took a long time to get our order...

The main reason for the low review was that the food (Corned beef hash) was undercooked and gave my girlfriend food very bad food poisoning (diarrhea, stomach pain and throwing up for hours).  Do not recommend eating here if you're concerned with how they cook your meat."}
{"text":"Food was great! Our server wasn't friendly. She had us waiting a lot. She seemed upset every time we asked for something it was really awkward. Took an hour to split our checks and get our bill. She definitely needs to smile!"}
{"text":"I had a full day planned in Vegas and didn't want to venture too far for a Saturday late morning breakfast. Seabreeze Café is located right in Mandalay Bay, not far from the hotel lobby and near the casino area. My boyfriend and I were fortunate to be seated right away and it seemed that the breakfast crowd was trickling out.
They serve breakfast and lunch until their closing time, which I believe is around 2 and the menu is pretty diverse from that perspective. Most people can find something appealing, whether it's a full meal or a lighter bite, such as a fruit cup, oatmeal or salad.
Service was very friendly and efficient-drinks came right away as well as our food. They have a great \"build your own omelet\" option and a \"skinny\" alternative made with egg whites with a fruit cup on the side instead of hash browns. I ordered that with spinach, tomato and cheddar. They definitely didn't skimp on the veggies which was welcome and the fruit cup had some nice fresh berries & melon. Was it an enjoyable meal? Sure, yes. Was it worth $17? Definitely not...but hey that's Vegas. It was average, not great and pricey to boot. 
They do feature some specials if you are inclined to save a few $$ which I should have ordered instead....There are probably some better options nearby if you are willing to explore the nearby area a bit more."}
{"text":"Gorgeous atmosphere! Beautiful dining room. That is where the praise for this cafe ends.

The service was slow, we waited 15 minutes to order, while our server flirted with the middle aged man and the next table. Coffee was fine, but not worth $5. Cold hard eggs with my benedict, cold hash browns. My kids chocolate chip pancakes had maybe 3 chocolate chips between the two plates. Also prepare yourself for overly salty, super thin bacon...which you will pay $5 for. At 4 slices that equals $1.25 a slice. The server realizing that she had left us waiting for a long time, comped our drinks. That's right, drinks plural. They charge full price for the kids beverages. So her comp saved me $20, almost a 1/3 of our bill.  At $66 before tip for breakfast for 3 people, 2 of which were kids meals, we will not be back. Overall subpar food."}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience. Our host and server were both sweet, attentive and informative.

If you're staying in Mandalay Bay, don't be intimidated. It's not as bad as everyone thinks.

I came in for breakfast around 8 am. Here's what I specifically ordered: huevos rancheros with a glass of apple juice. It was surprisingly very delicious and authentic, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice looking cafe within the Mandalay, food was just o.k and a little pricey for a cafe (but you have to expect that considering your surroundings) Unfortunately service was a bit slow in our area, but we got Breakfast done either way, Aloha"}
{"text":"All the classic breakfast items are here.   Country fried steak and and eggs, flatiron and eggs, triple thick cut ham and eggs.   Amazing hash browns...   Good food,  and well prepared.   I told my server I was \"unusually Thirsty\" and he brought me extra glasses of water and got me hydrated...   Important stuff!  U won't escape for less than 20 per person, but convenience means a lot when you wake up thirsty and hungry and the breakfast and service delivers on all 6 cylinders here"}
{"text":"We had a late breakfast / early lunch here Saturday, 12/17. There was nothing stellar and nothing awful. Just good, basic coffee shop fare - at resort hotel prices. All five in our group ordered something different, and all reported the same - good, but nothing extraordinary. The service was perhaps a tick better than normal, and it appeared clean and in good order."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast since it is quite convenient to get to if you are staying at the Mandalay Bay. We tried the salmon benedict and the egg white omelette. The salmon egg benedict is quite well done with tasty Hollandaise sauce. My eggs were perfectly cooked, slightly runny. The salmon was also quite fresh. However, the hash brown that came with the eggs benedict is quite bland and tasteless. The hash brown is also not crispy at all, in fact slightly soggy. The restaurant setting is quite decent with good decor and clean look overall. I recommend coming here for a convenient breakfast (again if you are staying at Mandalay Bay), but I am sure there are better places out there too around the strip."}
{"text":"It's a nice cafe but it's pretty pricey. I had the omelette and my boyfriend had the club sandwich. They were both good but we didn't finish our food and pretty much wasted some money. They do have bottomless drinks for a good price. The Bloody Mary was super cool!"}
{"text":"Expensive for breakfast but it was good. The inlet was nice, and the menu had a lot to choose from."}
{"text":"the service here is so amazing! we had all three mimosas and enjoyed a bloody mary too. the drinks are amazing. we only came here for brunch but we are so glad that we did! there are so many places to get food in Vegas but they really have an incredible brunch that blew us away. the servers were so sweet and kind and really took care of us. I love vegas so much because of places like this. If you want great food at a decent price, (for vegas), then this is the spot for you. It's quiet and calm and a nice place to take a break. it also has a beautiful view of the hotel and a lot of natural light that flows in. it is a nice place to relax."}
{"text":"We had two wonderful breakfasts at this spot in the Mandalay Bay hotel.  Both days, the service was very friendly.  Shannon, in particular, was very accommodating, and went the extra mile!

The first day, coffee was a little on the weak side, but the second morning, it was much better.

All of our breakfast plates were big helpings, and the quality was very good.  Of special note was the Corned Beef Hash, which I believe is made on site.  It is outstanding!

We also enjoyed a great Eggs Benedict, Brioche French Toast, and Ham Steak & Eggs (with wonderful Hash Browns!).

We ate both mornings at about 7:30-8:00AM - and there weren't many folks up yet, but everything was still very nice.  Do recommend it!"}
{"text":"Although the prices at this cafe inside Mandalay are a bit high, I found the food quality to be great for breakfast.  

The facility is large, clean and well kept.  Plenty of seating so I didn't have a wait.

My waiter wasn't friendly, but he was timely.  I got a huge breakfast and it was fantastic.  I'd definitely go back.

4 stars!"}
{"text":"We waited 15 minutes to be seated and then waited another 25 minutes before deciding to walk out. The waitress came over to adjacent tables and clearly ignored us. As we walked out we complained to the host and did not receive an apology for the wait time."}
{"text":"We had our lunch break from our convention/conference about noon and pretty much every restaurant had a huge line and our lunch break would be too long before we had to get back to work.  Luckily, we saw Seabreeze Café and there was no line whatsoever, I thought it was closed, and went in and was able to get a table for us in minutes.  

It's pretty nice looking inside and quite huge inside with many many tables.  It wasn't busy in there at all. Nice bright views through the nice windows looking outside at the palm trees and landscape of the grounds with a beach clubhouse feel. 

Since we were in a bit of a time crunch, we quickly put in our lunch orders.  I wanted a sandwich and the waitress said the Cuban sandwich was pretty good, I believe she read my mind because that's what I was looking at.  It was pretty good, shredded pork was flavorful and not dry, ham was plenty, cheese was melty with nice bread.  Mustard was the only part that was a little different from the traditional yellow, but it was fine.  Came with sweet potato waffle fries with a light dusting or parmesan cheese.  

Everyone enjoyed their sandwiches and salads so no issues with the food. Menu is quite large, breakfast is served all day. As expected, pricing is on the higher side for a sandwich, so I didn't get sticker shock.  

Service was ok, I think they were short handed that day because everyone was sitting in one particular section of the room and the staff was truckin' quite hard from table to table getting food out, refills and checks etc.   

Overall, it was fine as we were in & out pretty quick. This was the most excitement we got all day when attending our work conference."}
{"text":"This is an average breakfast spot in terms of taste, but excellent in terms of efficiency, service, and portions. Good to grab a quick bite to eat, but don't expect anything mind blowing! I liked the corned beef hash I ordered."}
{"text":"The service is top notch. The bottomless mimosas are super tasty. Food was hot and delicious.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We ate here twice, just to be fair, and both times the breakfasts served were a major disappointment.  We had eggs benedict the first time, I had the one with lobster.  Both arrived cold and the lobster in mine was chewy and watery, the hash browns were soggy and although the coffee was tasty it was also cold.  The next day our breakfast arrived cold again, the eggs were overcooked, and on top of that when we asked for buttered toast were refused saying it's a state regulation that doesn't allow the kitchen to do that. WTH??? Using a jelly package of butter on our cold toast was Not ideal. Do yourself a favor and get an Uber driver to take you anywhere but here  Even Denny's has a better breakfast and it won't cost the outrageous amount this one does."}
{"text":"The Seabreeze Cafe was a great stop for breakfast. They had a special for eggs, hash browns, and toast for only 9.99.  We added bacon to compete or breakfast and it was definitely filing! My daughter ordered the s'mores pancakes and she said they were a 10 out of 10!!  The service was quick and we were able to get in and out quickly. I'll be back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I hate to say (because I live for breakfast places), Seabreeze was just ok.  I had the same thing that I used to get at Raffles (scrambled egg whites, chicken and hash browns) and it wasn't as good in comparison.  Not that big of a deal, but I hate being disappointed in my hangover/let's do it again meal!  Lol Don't worry, I ate every morsel.  

That aside, the service was prompt and super sweet.  I miss the days of old Vegas when these cafes were open 24 hours.  The new hours are extremely limited--closing by the afternoon.  I understand that times change and I'll get used to it...someday...."}
{"text":"Came here to close out a weekend in Las Vegas. Needless to say, the black jack tables were dryer than the Nevada deserts. We were looking for some nourishment before our flight back to Los Angeles. 

We ordered the Chicken-Fried Steak and the Cheeseburger with pulled pork. The food was good. The chicken fried steak breading was OK, not great and the meat itself was dry. It sat on two buttermilk biscuits which were OK, not stellar. The saving grace of this dish was the gravy. While not the best gravy I had, it added a much needed flavor and texture. Also, how can you not love break egg yokes - like on anything, right?

The Cheeseburger was good, but not special. It instantly fell apart after my first bite, which is a super downgrade for burgers in my opinion. Luckily the burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the pulled pork complimented that flavor. The fries, however, were very very lackluster. 

All in all, decent meal for Vegas hotel prices. Not sure if I would have chosen it if it were not for the convenience (we stayed at Mandalay). 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is an amazing experience in some different ways... It's funny how a dish can be really a horrible quality at a grand, fabulous hotel such as Mandalay Bay.

I ordered a stack of pancake with berry compote and orange mascarpone. This is the picture of what I got - pancakes were not that great, but the mostly interesting part was berry compote. It wasn't sweet at all but just tasted like berries simply overcooked. Believe me, I can do better than this. Also mascapone... is Jemima launching a new product? This suspicious clot seemed to be dumped right on hot berry porridge and melted down like land-o-lake.

Well, to be fair, American breakfast was okay. At least that was just as fine as one at a typical diner. But definitely you wouldn't want to pay $20 for it -- and even don't need to mention that strange pancake. Fortunately we had $25 meal credit per person so I generously forgive this disaster. For the service, they are just doing their baseline."}
{"text":"08.09.2017

The family and I had to come here after we saw the S'mores pancakes on the menu last night when we walked by. 

Little O had the S'mores Pancakes all by herself, with H and I picking off some bites every now and then. When they brought it out we said there was no way she'd be able to finish it. But with a little help from us, it was demolished. 

H had the Belgian Waffles which were three mini waffles with some fruit on top. The outside was crisp as waffles should be. Then you expect it to be crunchy all the way through, but the inside was moist and had a sweet cake-like texture. Very yummy!

Hubby and I shared the American Breakfast--2 eggs, hash browns, bacon, toast and we added a short stack of pancakes. They were nice enough to equally split the entire order into two plates, not counting the pancakes. Everything was cooked well--eggs were not runny or rubbery, bacon was crisp and they were Texas toast slices of bread. 

I was lucky to have a 2-for-1 certificate that saved us at least $15 off our total. But even though we had it to save money, we were very impressed and finished all our food. With that in mind...we would definitely come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"The breakfast I had (eggs, shrimp, and grits) was mediocre. The way that the servers handles my table was strange. The food was not inexpensive by any means and coffee was $5. With the vast amount of choices in the area, I will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"I liked it better when it was Raffles Calf. The menu prices have gone up 40% and the food portions have gone down 40%. It is ridiculous to charge $16 for two eggs sausage and some hashbrowns. Four dollars extra per egg À la cart"}
{"text":"This is the former Raffle's Cafe and is still owned and operated by MGM Resorts.  The name is the only apparent change, menu is the same and service is HIGHLY on who your server is.  The big change is now the Raffle's omelette is called the Seabreeze omelette (Yippee????).  The service was slow but that may have been the servers were covering too many tables?   If you liked Raffles you will like Seabreeze, if not.....  Sorry, but don't get excited."}
{"text":"A truly unfortunate experience - which would have been made significantly better by an attentive manager.

Service was awful. When you sit down for breakfast on a Saturday morning - in Las Vegas - the least you expect is water and coffee service - with some urgency. It's breakfast!

After waiting for 17 minutes - with a totally barren table -I finally got up and expressed my concerns to a server assistant who brought the table coffee and water. Keep in mind this was a full 17 minutes after we sat down.

The waiter - Thomas - finally made it to our table - seemed rude - no apology for the service time - no special attentiveness for the delay - nothing - more like a toll taker than a waiter. In fact we saw him three times in a 45 minute meal - no drink refills - no- 'how's your food' - no 'can I get you anything else' - no interaction at all.

The restaurant was not all that busy but he made no attempt at hospitality at all.

If he had asked I would have commented on the meal as my food was not very good - but would have been passable if not for the lack of attentiveness - a meal is an experience - especially when traveling!

Feeling annoyed I again left the table and sought out the assistant manager. As I explained our experience he simply shook his head - literally did not say a word - just shook his head - no 'I'm sorry for your experience'- nothing. His demeanor and attitude did nothing more than add to the frustration.

On the way out of the restaurant I asked the hostess who the manager of the cafe was - she didn't know and could only provide me with the statement 'Ralph - I think' 

An unfortunate and unenjoyable experience that could have been improved significantly with a little hospitality."}
{"text":"The good 
-The \"all you can drink strawberry mimosas\"
-The \"all you can drink bloody ceasers \" 

The bad
-Way over priced 
-The lack of staff to refill the \"all you can drink\" beverages 
-The \"turkey\" bacon I swear was over cooked salmon jerky 
-My French toast sucked 
-My husbands chicken ceaser salad sucked 

Should of went to the House Of Blues.
Left disappointed and still hungry...."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here because we were staying upstairs at the Four Seasons and too drowsy to drive. Mediocre breakfast set for almost $20 each. Coffee is $5 which is way overpriced. I would not recommend here unless you have no other choice."}
{"text":"If your looking to get away from the Vegas noise, this is the secret place. Is the food overpriced? Sure! But, it is decent and this place is relaxing. 

Barcelona is hands down the best server, and she remembered me after 2 months when I returned and sat in her section. Ask for her and you won't be disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"Trying to find a good deal for breakfast on the strip can be difficult to say the least. Fortunately, if you keep your eyes open, deals can be found. Seabreeze has an awesome breakfast deal for around $10. 2 eggs, hash browns and toast. It was really good! And get the sourdough bread! It's awesome and made in house and the slices are huge! Kristy was our server and she was super awesome! Totally went out of her way for us! Even snagging a couple of to go coffee cups for us. It's nice to see that level of service! Thank you so much Kristy for making our morning!"}
{"text":"The Huevos Rancheros were amazing. Jalapeño refried beans, Chorizo sausage, scrambled eggs over a corn tortilla with Ranchero Sauce, and guacamole. Awesome!!! Service from Kristin was great too!!"}
{"text":"Don't do it. Turn around and go somewhere else. My husband, who never takes food back had to give back the 'special' breakfast. He said it was horrible. $12 for french toast. Just french toast. Me thinks not. $5 for cup of coffee, $5.25 for cranberry juice. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch before we went to the aquarium reef. Ordered the popular recommended salad and the ahi tuna sandwich. Both was very delicious. I asked the server for recommendation and she chose those two for us. Salad was well seasoned and put together. I added grilled chicken on top. The ahi tuna was cooked perfectly for the sandwich and very tasty. It was a cute cafe place and I would be coming back. :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped by Seabreeze Cafe yesterday morning for brunch and it was DELISH!  My husband and I couldn't decide what to get, so we ordered an omelet and a waffle and split them.  Our sever was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.  Lots of other things and the menu that I am looking forward to trying."}
{"text":"With an upscale beach bungalow feel, the decor and the atmosphere transports you to a island paradise which is far from the desert you are in. It was good for what it was. Simple quick and to the top breakfast food. More on the pricier side of the other options in Mandalay bay, this restaurant is tucked away from the smoke and loudness of the hotel. 
Food was mediocre but probably better than your other breakfast options at this hotel. 
All in all, it was fast service, decent food and good if you need to catch a flight."}
{"text":"Don't. Have. The. Lobster. Made me sick and had to postpone my travel. Plus the server was slow and not very nice, I would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"On our most recent visit we were lucky enough to have Shannon as our server a few times.  We stay at Mandalay Bay where this restaurant is located so it is convenient for having breakfast before hitting the pool. The food is good, not great but the service (from Shannon) makes up for it. This location used to be open 24 hours and had a larger variety of options. Now that they are only open for breakfast and lunch the menu is limited and average.  We truly miss the Baked Potato Soup they used to serve. The only reason I am reviewing this restaurant is to give a shout out to management for Shannon's outstanding service and great attitude.  Being a server myself and being overly critical when it comes to the service I receive, she made each visit enjoyable and fun....after all, I am on vacation when eating here and she more then makes it that much more fun!  A+++ to Shannon!"}
{"text":"Very pricey but the mimosas are amazing!! Endless mimosas for $16. Endless toast with all breakfasts including toast and friendly service!!!  Sat next to the view of the pool.  Really nice relaxing place for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and the food is not great. Your better bet is the buffet next door. The food was bland and the coffee tasted funny. I got sick afterward. My husband and I ordered 1 entree each and drinks and the bill came out to almost $60. It's not worth the price."}
{"text":"Seabreeze Cafe is a decent Casino Hotel Cafe.  Although the restaurant is beautiful and has a nice Tropical Vibe it is still just a Casino 24 hour Cafe that isn't open 24 hours any more.  Don't expect fine dining, or great service.  But I would much rather have breakfast here or at House of Blues rather than the Bayside Buffet!  Avoid the Buffet at Mandalay Bay!  It is so bad I won't even eat there with a comp until they rennovate it!  Seabreeze on the other hand is really good if you have been up all night gambling and are hungry.  I really enjoyed my Steak and Eggs.  Usually breakfast steaks are just one grade above Canner and Shoe Leather at Casino Cafe's.  But this was surprisingly Tender and good.  The Pancakes were also decent and it was very family friendly.  The service was slow, but they were also very busy.     Don't expect much and have a decent breakfast here instead of the horrible buffet next door!"}
{"text":"Nice location and view from the window tables.

We ate breakfast twice here.

Had the breakfast special.  Eggs, hash browns, toast and a side of bacon, $35.

Food was good.  Service was great.  Quiet early in the morning"}
{"text":"My only gripe with this place is amount of food you get for the price you pay. It's almost $20 for a few eggs, some toast  & some bacon. The food quality is decent, just a little bit better than what they have in their buffet & for the price you're spending here you're probably better off having breakfast or lunch at the buffet. Besides that the restaurant is nice & clean, the wait staff was great, but will all the other options for breakfast & lunch in Vegas this wouldn't be near any of my top choices to eat. This is pretty much an option to eat if you're staying at the hotel, you wake up hung over & you don't feel like traveling too far to eat."}
{"text":"Did not have a good experience here at all. To start off they said there was a ten minute wait in which we waited 25+ minutes. There was a couple waiting there as well who had been there before us and said they had been sitting for 30 minutes. It wasn't even busy. Finally when we walked in to get seated the entire place barely had anyone in it and there was like six staff members. It seemed very understaffed. Our waitress came over and got our orders. The couple that was waiting in the beginning walked out of the restaurant and said \"we can't wait any longer\" because once inside no one served them. Once the meals came one of the four had to get sent back because it was incorrect and overall the breakfast was fair at best. When the check came out waitress disappeared and we had to ask two people to get her. Once she came we asked to speak with the manager. He didn't seem to care at all about the complaint we made which adds up to why this place looked like a ghost town.The food is heavily overpriced and the experience was awful. Luckily the staff and the Mandalay Bay took care of us in the end. Would not go here again. If you want a good quick meal head over to citizens instead."}
{"text":"They should shit this place down.  The worst food I have ever had.  This place needs to go and should shut down.   The food is terrible and the service is bad.   I would not serve this food to hungry pigs."}
{"text":"Everything about Seabreeze is pretty average. The service is slow, the food is over priced, and in the two times I went during my stay at Mandalay the dining room had an atmosphere of stuffiness. I really wouldn't have gone if I wasn't staying at the hotel.

The first time I came for lunch I ordered the Ahi Tuna Poke. It wasn't bad, the Wasabi cream had a nice little kick to it. However, I would have preferred it to be served on a lettuce bed, or something other than crispy wontons. 

I went back for breakfast the next day and had the lobster omelet. PLEASE take a look at the picture I post with it. It looks like the Chef's all took the day off and they had to get the waiters to pull double duty in the kitchen. The omelet really wasn't that good, and the cheese is just kinda sitting on top of it. That might be why the service was so slow."}
{"text":"If you want a very fast, efficient waitstaff that brings you heaps amount of food (not great, not bad, but more like comfort diner food with large portions), this is the place to go for a bite to eat. First of all, this place is huge!  Doesn't look much when you see it from the casino. 

I had a hangover and needed breakfast in a bad way.  This place, pure coincidence, fixed me up. Must have been that big fluffy croissant with what seemed to be 2 or 3 eggs and lots of bacon, and perfectly crispy hashbrowns.  It hit the spot.  $15 for a breakfast sandwich?  Sounds steep, but for me, it was money spent well. 

Table for 2 for breakfast with coffee and diet coke runs $50 with tip. A-okay in my book. 

There are other places at the Mandalay bay for breakfast (food court, breakfast buffet, House of Blues, Citizens, so don't overlook this place!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my crab-cakes, I thought it was way overpriced and nothing particularly special for that price point. Very full with the serving size."}
{"text":"If the food wasn't decent I would have given this restaurant 1 star. Rosy and Flora were our waitresses and they were disrespectful and rude. We didn't get any service for the first 10 minutes we were seated. My party had to wave someone down to come get our drink orders. We finally got our drinks and my mother wanted a straw and Rosy threw the straws on our table. Unbelievable. What horrible way to treat a customer. Our food comes out and they forgot the sausage and argues instead of simply apologizing and getting it. We asked to speak to the manager and he was also rude. He didn't really seem to care to actually \"manage\" the situation and unfortunately I don't think he should have a management position without taking any type of initiative."}
{"text":"5/8/16:  What a pleasant surprise!  To be honest, I really was not expecting much.  Typically the mid-end hotel-owned eateries rarely are as good as anything within driving distance of similar price.  I think the only exceptions to this tend to be the ultra-high end restaurants at some hotels, of which some really are world-class.

But here was this huge hallway and space underneath the Seabreeze Cafe sign.  I mean, just one big room of nothing except for a podium and a cute host.  Somewhat intimidating, but we just got up and were in a rush to get to the Encore Beach Club for one of Avicii's last concerts of his career (!!! yeah wtf... at the height of his fame!) so we said hey, why not...

As we walked past that grand hallway, we entered the dining room, and wow............ it's REALLY nice.  TONS and TONS of space.  In fact, I think this restaurant might have the most space per table of any I have ever been to.  Basically each table gets its own corner of a semi-walled space.  All the walls were gorgeously carved, as well as the Roman-styled columns.  Lots of plants and decorations too.  Just felt so luxurious.

And the food was quite nice too!...

1. Fresh Orange Juice $5:  Tasted kinda 1/2 store-bought 1/2 fresh.

2. Coffee $5:  Not bad coffee.  Medium bodied and smooth.  Yeah, it's Five Bucks.  Oh well.

3. Country-Fried Steak $17 \"smothered in homemade country gravy with buttermilk biscuit and two eggs any style\":  So.... again, I wasn't expecting much in the way of food, but hey, it's pretty good!  I mean, I think it could have been crunchier, and the meat somewhat thicker, but the flavor was really great.  And the gravy was good too!--I have had so many bland country gravies lately that it was so refreshing to actually have some gravy with good flavor!  And the biscuits were really nice too--great fluffy and airy texture.  It was kinda cool they placed the biscuits half under the meat,... it helped to keep it all separated should you want to eat it that way.  Anyway, I think this country-fried steak was above average.  7/10

4. Breakfast Croissant $15 \"cheddar cheese, scrambled eggs and bacon on homemade croissant served with hash browns\":  My gf, the baker, said she thought that this probably wasn't \"homemade\" as claimed, but anyway, it tasted fine.  I couldn't remember how the hash browns tasted, but I think it all was decent.  Pretty expensive for what you get though.  If it were just by taste, I'd say 5-6 / 10, but given the price... 4/10

Well..... so I think the low 2.5 star rating reflects the relatively high price for such food.  But well, my country-fried steak was actually pretty good.  And the decor was really epic.  I mean, it's impressive.  Very impressive looking.  So, overall, we really liked eating here.

I wouldn't make a trip here just to try this place, but if you're feeling lazy and are already staying at Mandalay Bay, don't hesitate to come here!

{"text":"Wow!  The way the light casts into this cafe... it really makes you feel like you're on the other side of the world from the Las Vegas strip!  My date and I came here for lunch (er, our breakfast - we're night owls!), and both of us had the made-in-house yogurt with the fresh berries - just, amazing.  Delicious.  I'm salivating at 3:30 in the morning just thinking about it.  I can't remember the main course that my date ordered, but he enjoyed it immensely.  I got an omelette; I like that it was not heavily salted or greased, as I feel most restaurant omelettes are.  I added the amount of salt I wanted, and it was perfect.  The whole wheat toast that came with was delicious, as well!  To top off the positive experienced, our server was very sweet, and checked on us frequently.  Definitely a fan of this place, and definitely coming back at some point!"}
{"text":"Came here for our yearly Admin Lunch. Service was slow and there were not many people in the restaurant. Food wasn't anything to rave about . Had the club and some fruit nothing to fancy. We did order the desserts which were only 2 choices. We had a party of 7 so we got 2 plates the server couldn't even tell us what the flavors of the cakes were. All she kept saying was \" I am not sure\" ? Very Strange. I would say pass this place up and walk over to the Buffet next door and at least get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast. Had a typical classic breakfast. They have a good sized menu. The prices ranged from 10-20 for their entree breakfast dishes. Michelle the hostess was very friendly. The restaurant is spacious so you most likely won't have to wait for a table. They have views of the pool area."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself was nice, clean, and not very busy - yet the wait was long. Short staffed? Strange considering its a Las Vegas Casino cafe. The wait for our actual waiter also was somewhat long. At that point I was hoping the food would've been worth the wait...wait for it...no, no it was not. My hubbs chicken club sandwich was bland - not even the tomato and onions added flavor!  My breakfast was a basic eggs over medium, hashbrowns, pork sausage with a short stack side. Eggs are eggs, but I was close to unscrewing the salt shaker top and pour the contents on the bland potato hash. They were undercooked and absolutely no seasonings. The pork sausage was more fat than meat - also no flavor. So I'll just stop there and say the rest was just as underwhelming...coffee sucked too! Two words: brown water :/"}
{"text":"The Seabreeze Cafe delivered on a spectacular brunch, Shannon is the best server in town. She makes you feel good so you leave full and happy. We had the S'mores pancakes, oatmeal, breakfast sandwhich and smoked salmon platter. Everything was very delicious food!"}

Only saw the waiter 3 times, to take the order, deliver the food, & to get us our check. I never even got a refill for my water. Food was good, I got the $10 breakfast which included 2 eggs, a small helping of hashbrowns, a 1 slice of toast. Just like Denny's, but 3 times the price. Oh yeah, ALL drinks are $5.50.... seriously stupid!!! I get that it's Vegas, but why people pay it is beyond me."}

{"text":"My very first vegas trip I remember going to this place half inebriated but very aware of my experience. I remember my friend (who was a vegas vet) saying that WE HAVE TO EAT HERE. I was a little hesitant at first because It was very late  (or very early in the morning) and I wasn't sure I wanted to spend a lot of money on some food just to sober up....The place looks like you're going to come out with an 80.00 bill .....BUT I was pleasantly surprised

now every vegas hotel is going to have their take on a Denny's/Ihop type restaurant. This is mandalay bay's . However the difference between other restaurants and this one is that you feel like you're in a better restaurant than you actually are...kudos for that Mandalay. I remember we all got basic breakfast plates and pancakes. All of which was very delicious and satisfying. you're not going to be taken away or pumped up like popeye after eating his spinach after eating here but you will be satisfied with your meal. I'd really make this a morning /brunch destination on your first or last day in town. A tranquil place to recover at without putting you in debt ."}
{"text":"Has a nice setting, the ceiling was especially nice.

Food was ok, higher quality feel than a Denny's but same quality taste. I like Denny's.

This place isn't bad, but it's expensive. A full breakfast will be about $16-$22"}
{"text":"Seabreeze Cafe is located at the Mandalay Bay. It serves all-day breakfast and lunch. 

At my visit. I found the restaurant to be quite elegant and sophisticated. In addition to the traditional items you can find on the menu,  Seabreeze offers some unique meals. The one that stood up to me the most was the Chocolate Smores Pancake - chocolate chip pancakes topped with marshmallow cream, Graham cracker crumbs and chocolate syrup. The pancakes were very good and they were reasonably priced too. 

Overall, I was quite pleased with Seabreeze and I would highly recommend it!"}
