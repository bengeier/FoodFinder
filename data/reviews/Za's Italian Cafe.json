{"text":"it was one of my favorite places in the campus. Couldn't wait to go there again and again!!! The only thing that I don't like is the pizza."}
{"text":"Yes, i will scantron in my food, and know it will be de-lish

Za's has a little of everything- pasta, grinders, salads, soup, smoothies, pizza, etc. And everything is great. They also serve tiramisu and cheesecake from cheesecake factory for desert.

So why 4 stars? It's a little pricey for what you get. You do get your money's worth with the pasta (usually)... but the grinders and pizza are kinda small if you ask me for how much they want."}
{"text":"I went to eat lunch here today. I ordered pasta marinara with shrimp and meatballs. Everything was good EXCEPT the shrimp. They were chewy with an intense fishy seafood flavor...which is not normal. I eat a lot of shrimp from other restaurants and they taste just fine. The ones served by Za's are either spoiled or just not prepared right. I went to talk to the manager at the cash registered and he basically didn't care. He asked if I wanted something else and I said no....because I had already eaten my entree. I told him about the situation and he told me, \"I don't know what you're talking about, but I'll check it out for you.\" I was not looking for a refund, all I wanted for them to do was realize that they serve disgusting shrimp.

WARNING: DONT ORDER SHRIMP AT ZAs.....go to red lobster for shrimp because they actually care about the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru today and got a Caesar grilled chicken salad which I love but got home to eat it and noticed hardly any chicken at all so I basically paid for lettuce. I will stick to the other places where I can TASTE THE CHICKEN IN MY SALAD. I will say the service was good though."}
{"text":"I used to be a faithful Za's diner, but recently I've found myself increasingly disappointed.  I usually order from the salad menu, though since they have upped their prices these no longer feel like the great deal I once thought they were.  Yeah, it's nice to be able to create my own combinations, but the cost is just too high.  Five bucks for a salad without any meat?  Close to seven if you want to add chicken (and even that can be risky--sometimes it has this nasty slimy texture to it).

The garlic bread that comes with the salad totally negates any health benefits you may be recieving.  I don't know for sure, but I bet that's not butter on there: think oleo or some other man-made substitute.

The pastas and pizzas really aren't anything worth mentioning, so I won't and I haven't had a pannini here for years.

The salads were the only thing pulling me into Za's on a regular basis and after becoming disillusioned with the whole charade, I don't think I'll be back any time soon.

Sorry, Za's.  It was fun while it lasted."}
{"text":"Made to order pizza and sandwiches. Great alternative to endless chain restraint food"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Za's from friends so I decided to stop in for a Saturday lunch. The place was surprisingly packed, but they got the food out to us quickly. I ordered the BBQ chicken ranch pizza and it didn't have an overwhelmingly ranch flavor, which I loved. Prices were good, employees were friendly (I loved the cashier's Hawaiian shirt!) so I will be back. I also got the tiramisu, it was little frozen but delicious."}
{"text":"Great lunch and even dinner place. The custom pasta is the best \"fast food\" deal there is. Lots of pasta, built to your order, at around 5 dollars. Anyone who goes to noodles and company instead is a moron. Better food at a better price. The upstairs is pretty well decorated, but it can get crowded at times."}
{"text":"Ate here before the Illinois Marathon, so needless to say, me and my group ate a lot of food. The food itself is probably only 3-stars (A-Okay), but the fact that it's so inexpensive gives it another star for me. I love Italian food and sometimes I don't need the white tablecloth, the server with the green button or even Euro prices. I just need carbs and Za's did it for me. We had a few desserts, which were great. 

My wife got the creamy chicken pesto, which actually wasn't that good. I got the lasagna, which was probably 3 stars, but again - it was quick, easy and cheap. That's what Za's promotes and that's what it is. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I found the experience at Za's to be really off-putting and I don't think that I get the concept of this place.  It's seems like this restaurant is set up so that the people that work there have as little interaction with the customers as possible.

When you arrive, you fill out a form to order the food that you want and then write your name on it at the bottom.  You then hand that form to a person who barely acknowledges your existence and pay that person for the food that you ordered.  You then go sit down in the dining room.  This is the only direct interaction that you will have with a person at this restaurant.

The people that work in the restaurant will then quietly call out your name when your food is ready. It will be waiting in an area called \"The Window\"... you then retrieve your own food from the window, fill your own drink, and retrieve whatever side items you paid for.

Once finished with your meal, you are expected to bus you own table and place your dishes in a bin which is sitting on the garbage bin.

At no point are you offered any assistance in figuring any of this out.

You have to just figure it out on your own or ask another customer....or someone that works there, if you can find one.  (It's like they are trained to not talk to you.)

In my case, the food tasted like it fresh out of a can, and it was cold by the time I got it.  I never heard anyone call my name from \"The Window\" when it was ready so it sat there for 10 minutes.  Another customer had to come over to my table and ask me if I had ordered food because she heard the person quietly call out a random name and we were the only people there that hadn't eaten...so she assumed that it was our food.

The experience here was so confusing and disappointing that I frankly don't know why this place even exists.  Why does a business that normally specializes in hospitality provide absolutely none?

I wouldn't return to eat at this place even if someone else were buying.  My experience at Za's is the reason why I downloaded Yelp onto my phone.

If you want fake Italian food, go to Fazoli's...at least you'll talk to a human person who smiles at you and gives you free breadsticks."}
{"text":"I have given Za's a chance twice now. Salads are very basic and it's extremely upsetting to wait 15 minutes for your food (a veg salad) to get back to your car/work and find out you are missing items you paid extra for. Why did I stand there and check all the boxes thinking \"yeah, that sounds good!\" I'm over this place..."}
{"text":"Ate here with the family to celebrate a birthday while at the same time ordering relatively healthy food. Be it pastas, salads or soups, we have all enjoyed eating at Za's. The Loaded Baked Potato Soup was excellent, as usual. The sandwiches, pastas and salads were up to the usual Za's standard of excellence. We were eating later in the evening and had the place all to ourselves. Great food and fast friendly service -- what more could you want?"}
{"text":"For some reason this place is really popular on campus.  I'm sure the great location (corner of Green and Wright) along with the relatively cheap prices and vast selection has something to do with it, but I just can't understand the draw of it...

The food itself is alright - maybe even a little better than just alright - but a little too oily for my liking, and the tables almost always feel sticky/oily/just make me feel dirty.

Upon walking in, you come upon a bunch of scantron sheets of varying colors (one color for salad, pasta, pizza, panini's) for you to make a custom creation or choose one of their pre-designed selections.  Although their pastas don't look like much portion-wise, you get a sizable slice of toasted garlic bread along with it and the pasta is actually quite filling.  Ditto with the salads, pizzas, panini's.  I haven't really had any of the tasty looking desserts in the display by the cashier outside of a bite of their tira-misu which wasn't half bad, but definitely nothing spectacular either.

Overall, an okay place to sit and chat with friends over lunch (moreso for the sitting and chatting, I would say) on Green St., but the Basil Thai in Urbana is still my place of choice for when I have the occasional free afternoon to catch up with friends and grab a good, inexpensive bite to eat at the same time."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Half the time fresh and delish, others not so much.  Honestly, I think Za's is overrated. Vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"Good stuff. I had a pizza and salad combo for 7 bucks. This was plenty of food for me. I loved that I could pick at I wanted on my pizza at no extra charge. I recommend this for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Descent place to eat and relax. The ordering here is somewhat fast despite being a busy place. I like the service here. Friendly. One can make their combos and mix/match. The ingredients here are good and there is taste to the food. Great portion for the price."}
{"text":"Totally customizable  makes this perfect for my whole family. My kids can make it their own way while my SO can have something  a little  different each time  while I get what I've found works for me.  They even have 5 different flavors of iced tea and caffeine free drink options! Bring you cup back to reuse next time for a drink  discount too.

I get to pick my toppings instead  of having to tell them to hold half of what comes on it.  The salads have more options than most salad bars around here like local goat cheese, green apples, and walnuts. And while I'm not a fan of the pizza I enjoy the cheese  tortellini (which costs no more than the spaghetti) with 4 add ins. 

Service hasn't always been perfect but the once or twice we've had problems they were fixed.

For the same sorts of prices, they blow fazolli's out of the water.  and are just better tasting and more comfortable --not to mention better prices -- than olive garden."}
{"text":"I'm really a fan of Za's ordering system because it allows you to customize dishes or just go with what's on the menu. I came here for lunch with a friend and it was an interesting experience. Overall, the quality of food matches the prices very well and it's generally inexpensive,

My friend decided to experiment with a peculiar combination of ingrediants on her pizza at the risk of being disappointed. Her face slowly went from \"that's not bad\" to \"I'm dying a bit inside with each bite\" as she continued to eat. We branded the pizza, the GPS (garlic, pain, and sadness) pizza. So just a tip if you mix ingrediants; do not combine pineapple with garlic, basil, and tomatoes. They tend to go a little heavy on the garlic if you order it so anything sweet is going to taste like tears and disappointment when added. Otherwise, everything was very good. They have a pretty large selection of food and give pretty decent portions for the price. I would recommend this place for anyone who just wants to drop in and get a quick bite to eat. It's also not a bad place to hang out for a bit and converse with friends; they even have a lounge area with couches."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but a little overpriced. Usually not very busy, fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Good value. Starting at the register I had friendly and courteous service, which in today's world, is not so c'mon anymore."}
{"text":"I ordered a 2 combo to go for lunch today.  1/2 build your own pasta and loaded baked potato soup.

The soup: Very thick and chalky.  More like a paste,  It tasted like it had been sitting there for several days.  Not impressed.

Build your own pasta:  Three cheese blend sauce with broccoli, mushrooms, tomato and carrots.  I added a bunch of salt and pepper.  The pasta was a little dry but I thought the flavor of all the vegetables was good.  The problem?  2 tomatoes, 3 thin slices of mushroom, 2 pieces of broccoli and a few slivers of carrots.  The rest was just a big carton of pasta.  I wish there would have been more veggies and less pasta..  

Chocolate chip cookie: The saving grace!  It was good. And I needed it after throwing the soup and most of the pasta away."}
{"text":"I should have taken my food back to be reheated.

I ordered an everything pizza on pizza bread but not all of the cheese was melted and the green peppers and mushrooms were sprinkled freshly onto the already warm bread.

Otherwise, good place to hang out during off-peak (lunch/dinner) times. Large menu."}
{"text":"We were passing thru Illinois, when we saw Za's Italian Cafe. It was a Sunday night around dinner time so they had a bit of a wait. 

The ordering system here is similar to Which Wich, in that everything is customizable. They had different sheets of paper near the entry such as Pasta, Pizza, Salad, Etc. You can pick house options, or you could completely customize everything yourself. 

We ordered the lasagna, pesto chicken, and the Mama Mia. The meals took awhile to make, since there was only 3 people working. The cool part was that you could see into the kitchen and watch them cook. 

The downside was that our meal was just meh. They told us that our lasagnas are going to take long we because they were frozen. When we got them, they weren't heated up all the way through and cold in the middle. The garlic breads were baked in advance so when we got them, they were also cold. It's a shame, because the flavors were there! 

They also had dessert options such as cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"I don't really know what to say about this place because it was not memorable. I was looking forward to eating here because it was recommended and it seemed like an interesting place. I ordered what should've been a great pizza, but it was bland and many many notches down from the amazing flatbread pizzas I make at home."}
{"text":"Za's has been a favorite spot for our family for some time.  Like most places we go, I have my favorite choices from here that I come specifically to enjoy!  And they were so good that there have been times that I have literally made the drive just to partake of their cheese tortellini with pesto and sun dried tomatoes and salad with house dressing.  Mmm!  We came today only to find that they have taken sun dried tomatoes off of the menu as well as their house dressing!!!!!  . Words cannot convey my level of disappointment at this decision on Za's part.  I had to settle for balsamic vinaigrette which left my formerly awesome salad experience being just any old salad - certainly nothing I would travel for.  The cheese tortellini without sun dried tomatoes was still pretty decent but definitely still a disappointment.  I know you can't please everyone all of the time, but this menu overhaul does make a difference for THIS customer.  I am not saying we will not ever come, just saying we are a lot less likely now that our favorites have been axed from the menu.  I will say that I ended up switching out the balsamic (didn't really care much for it) to the Asian ginger sesame and that helped, but it still leaves me longing for the house dressing I loved so much!! I am still going to give it 3 stars because the place is cool, the service has always been good and the food is still decent.  Also, they still have an awesome iced tea bar I love (please don't get rid of the peach tea!). It just doesn't have the wow factor for me to give it the four or five I would have if I was still wowed, though.  Sorry.  ."}
{"text":"Eh. Food mediocre. My daughter and I went upstairs to eat and about died from the lack of air circulation and overwhelming smell of dirty gym socks. We ate in record time!"}
{"text":"Is this really a Fazoli's in disguise as a semi-trendy yet cheezy college student hang-out? The food was bland and flavorless. My husband had pizza and I had pasta. Neither tasted good. I think I would have rather had Fazolis."}
{"text":"I didn't go to U of I, but when I am in that area, I demand to stop here! The line is facilitated well with menu cards to check off what you want, and the meal will be ready, hot and fresh in 10-15 minutes. The food is awesome! I've tried pizza and some sandwiches and have not been disappointed. Prices are college-kid friendly. It's like an italian Panera, but x100 better!"}
{"text":"Zas is a winner choice. It's like a Panera, but more unique.  Sandwiches, salads, soups, pastas, pizza, combos, coffees, smoothies... And you can make your own for most by checking off ingredients. Get the garlic bread (unless you're on a diet). Great in combination with broccoli cheddar soup. Much prefer this for lunch over food court options at the mall across the street."}
{"text":"Probably the worst place I have ate at in champaign Urbana. Had to settle for a dirty table because they don't wipe down tables. And the food had that fresh out of the microwave pre-made consistency. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Za's is good food for about the right price I'd say. That's really all you can ever ask from a restaurant. They got an incredible renovation after the fire - the upstairs rooms are now larger and filled with massive HDTVs playing music videos and the entire restaurant is now super clean which is a bonus for sure.

My go to is the Mac & Cheese with Buffalo Chicken. It's incredibly filling for sure, you definitely get your money's worth with this order and the flavor is superb. I admit I find myself wishing for a bit more buffalo chicken but I love the flavors so much it's still my go-to order. It also comes with some garlic bread which is good for mopping up the leftover cheese sauce. I've also had their sandwiches and pizzas (the BBQ chicken's pretty good) and been satisfied with whatever choice I make.

The customizable options on the food are good because you end up getting what you want, but they can seem to nickle and dime you. Pick you entree and then add a meat for a few bucks, add a sauce for another buck, add a drink for a few bucks, add etc for a buck....just something to be aware of when making your meal.

Solid 4 star restaurant though."}
{"text":"I like the variety Za's offers. They have soup, salad, sandwiches, pizza and a combo menu which allows you to select what you want. They have menu items available, or if you are picky or want to create your own, flip over the menu and select from their list of items to create a one-of-a-kind dish. Their prices are reasonable for the amount of food you receive and I have never been disappointed. The only thing keeping me from giving them five stars is that they do not offer nutritional value of their menu items. Once they offer the nutrition on their website, I'll upgrade them here too!"}
{"text":"This is easily one of the worst places I have ever been. Bad service, terrible food, and horrible atmosphere. So what I'm saying is don't go. Get chef boy r' de you'll be happier."}
{"text":"For the price you can't beat Za's. You can customize everything and I'm just lovin' their new combos. Plus you can look at the  menu on their website before you go."}
{"text":"I am honestly struggling to say anything nice about this establishment...Incomprehensible and needlessly complicated ordering system, overpriced, dirty, and with terrible food to boot.  My elderly mother's favorite place to eat - giant shocker. I've eaten here several times for her sake but never again, I love my mother, but not THAT much.  

Salads are overdressed and tend to have off greens, soups taste like they came right off the back of a Sysco truck and are woefully over salted but otherwise under seasoned. Pizza is totally inedible, the sauce seems to be composed solely of HFCS and tomato paste, the cheese is gummy and flavorless and the less said about the crust the better.  Calling this pizza is an insult to pizza. Pasta is overcooked and I have yet to find a sauce that I'd be willing to take a second taste of.  Even my husband, who is generally happy as long as his meal involves chicken, cannot stomach the food here, even though he's tried the sandwiches and pastas here several times.  I truly have yet to experience a meal where I could eat more than 3 bites of anything  before throwing in the towel in absolute disgust.

I just don't get it, I really don't, from the reviews on here, it seems like people actually LIKE this place.  Do people enjoy eating bland food at sticky tables? Am I missing something here? The staff is very nice and I think they have wi-fi as I often see long diners on laptops inside, but this doesn't make up for the general awfulness of the place. No more and then, Za's, even for my mother's sake."}
{"text":"This has been hit or miss for me over the years, but the last 3 times I've been at this location has been great.  Hopefully the current staff stays because they are great!"}
{"text":"Za's is a mixed bag. It's at once wonderful because you can make pizzas, panini, and pastas out of a dazzling amount of combinations thanks to their ballot system, but also frustrating because of inconsistency and bad service. 

Entrees are what you make of them. They can be gross (the buffalo ranch cheese panini I once had) or delicious (my favorite gouda/walnut/italian sausage/pesto pizza combo I invented) depending on how you fill out the pre-made ballots. The annoying thing is that the amount of complexity involved in the system makes for some waiting time. It's upscape fast food minus the fast. Some of their ingredients are also not exactly top-notch. 

However, the restaurant itself is nice. I especially like the upstairs rooms with their baroque tiled ceilings and french paintings. Overally, while it isn't perfect, it's a good place to bring a group of friends. No matter how diverse your party is, they can probably make up something they like."}
{"text":"I like to eat the pizza here from the drive-through. 

It takes some time to go through the drive-through, but that is to be expected when ordering custom pizzas.

I don't know of anywhere else in town where I can order my Classic crust, Alfredo sauce, sun-Dried tomatoes/red peppers/pepperoini/Mozz-feta cheeze pizza.

The pizzas aren't completely consistent.   sometimes it tastes like they're swimming in sauce, and sometimes it tastes like there's not much sauce at all, and sometimes the pizza is undercooked, but I keep coming back because I normally enjoy my pizza."}
{"text":"Za's is my favorite place to eat on campus. I always get the same custom chicken/pasta dish. It has rarely, if ever, let me down. They deal with the large lunch crowd pretty well too. 

Looking forward to going back to school this fall and consuming more."}
{"text":"The idea of customizable  Italian food really appeals to me. I can have whichever veggies on my pasta that fits my mood that particular day. ANd what's more awesome is that I'm feeling less adventurous, I can just pick a pre-made entree. Oh, and did I mention that the tiramisu is absolutely scrumptious here? I think it beats Moonstruck's!

One more thing about this location.. it's across the street from the Marketplace mall! What a great way to end a trip to the mall!"}
{"text":"I've been to the on-campus Za's countless times over my years in Champaign and have always enjoyed it. Food portions appear to be fair for the price, there are decent vegetarian options, they fill out orders quickly, and the selection is a good balance of flexibility and ease. The stand-alone Za's was of similar quality."}
{"text":"Since there seems to be confusion about Za's vs. MiaZa's, this particular page is for Za's off-campus. Back in the day when it was simply Za's on campus, the food was delicious, but no more.

I went to the Za's on Springfield and was tortured by lukewarm cheese tortellini with bolognese sauce and broccoli, carrots, and red peppers. They forgot the fourth topping I had requested so I cannot comment on the potential mediocrity of that item. I can only vouch for what I did taste, and boy was it subpar. I guess I was happy that garlic bread came with it.

The service was also terrible. I had to get the drive-up employee's attention. When the food was ready, the guy handed it to me without saying anything. In fact, he was completely turned towards another employee, talking and not paying attention. Consequently, he did not notice that he crushed the container. Thankfully there was no spillage.

I wouldn't eat here unless I am desperate."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad here that was supposed to come on romaine lettuce and ample vegetables on top. Instead, I ended up with iceberg and a few half-frozen vegetables. I will likely not be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Za's is really close to work and I really want to like it more than I do. I keep trying, but it's just not my favorite place to go. 

You can pick what kind of pizza or pasta or sandwich or salad or soup you want and totally customize it, but really the quality is just kinda mediocre at best. 

They do have the most amazing selection of iced tea in town. And they have individual servings of Cheesecake Factory desserts. So maybe it's a nice option to meet with a friend for a mid-afternoon chat instead of lunch that is hit or miss. 

I know that this restaurant supports a lot of things in Champaign so I want to support them in some way. I'm sure I'll continue to come back even if it isn't a wow factor for me. I can always have an iced tea. ;)"}
{"text":"At least the atmosphere is fun, because the food stinks!  The only reason I'm giving two stars is the delicious iced green tea.  I ordered a pasta with lemon butter, artichokes, spinach, broccoli, and fresh garlic, but as far as I could tell, the lemon butter was supposed to make up for the lack of vegetables.  Please give me more than six leaves of spinach and five small broccolis for a whole plate of pasta!  Norm P.'s food was even worse.  It was swimming in sauce to the point of being disgusting and he couldn't even finish it.  All in all, come for the drinks but not for the food.  I could make this same meal at home for less than a dollar, and it would taste much better."}
{"text":"I have never seen a more cross contaminated restaurant in my life. Only observed while I was waiting for food. And while I had to wait for them to correct 3 of our meals. I used to love this place, I'm not sure what happened but it has gone to hell and there is no end in sight. I'll never set foot in here again."}
{"text":"There's no chicken or flavor in my lemon chicken....none...not one piece... nothing other than cooked noodles... and greasy onions and peppers. The dressing on the Chinese chicken salad is tasty, but barely two dinky little pieces of chicken in it. Can hardly be called chicken salad. If you're going to have chicken in the name, shouldn't you chicken in the meal? Disappointing."}
{"text":"They serve Cheesecake Factory cheesecake slices. Bring their cup back next visit for a 25¢ discount off your drink. Pasta, pizza, sandwiches, soup, and salad - all are wonderful. Pricing matches quality, around $9 for large portions."}
{"text":"I worked here (the original Green & Wright location) for 3 years in college (well, 1.5 years at Delights in the Union before it closed, and the other 1.5 here) and holy crap I miss it.

The sheer amount of options here will blow your mind. You could eat there very single day for a year and not have the same thing twice. Za's offers pizzas, pastas, salads, and open-faced sandwiches. Unless something goes horribly wrong (or a customer suddenly remember that they are allergic to the sauce they ordered and we need to remake it), everything is usually ready within 5 minutes.

It's a busy, popular campus hotspot, and was responsible for most of my meals during my junior and senior years of college. Best place to work - ever."}
{"text":"People love this place but there is a bad stench, especially in the back dining area. The dirty dish deposit areas needs sanitizing. The windows are clean now so great job there. Let's sanitize the trash bins near the dining areas, put some gloves on the food preparers and we should be in good shape!!
Let's make this a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Za's used to be better.  Other than convenience (good location), there's not a whole lot going for them.  It's overrated by most U of I students, crowded at lunchtime, and the food isn't anything special.  The quality of both the garlic bread and the overal cleanliness of the restaurant have steeply dropped in the past couple of years."}
{"text":"What a delicious surprise this place was!  My son and I found it on yelp.  I had half a pizza and half a sandwich.  They were both delicious! My pizza was pepperoni and fresh basil.  Since it cost extra for extra cheese I didn't order it but my cheese loving self was surprised and pleased at the amount of cheese on it! My sandwich was turkey, provolone on a toasted hoagie roll.  Delicious but I might ask to not have it toasted next time, it was very...crunchy.   My son had half a salad and half a sandwich.  He loved his also.  
The only bad part is the price was bordering on high for lunch.  The food and drinks were $20.  Not too bad, but there are places where you can do better for lunch.  
Oh, also as we were filling out our order sheets some teenagers came in and said there was a fight in the parking lot.  Apparently it's not the best part of town.  
We will go back, for sure! I took a photo of my food but not sure I can figure out how to post it.  LOL!  I'll work on that."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a quick meal that's not fast food.  You get to design your own dish by choosing the ingredients.  Price is cheap and the place is very clean.  Only thing is, seems like no matter what I choose in my dish, they all end up tasting pretty much the same..."}
{"text":"the location is the only real reason i eat here.  it's the first food option when walking from the Engineering campus to Green Street.  the food is not bad but not spectacular either.  you can basically get anything you want in terms of pasta, pizza, or salad.  the cheesecake factory offerings always look good and i'm happy they are there, but i've never actually eated any of that so can't comment on the quality.  lots of seating makes it less stressful if you are hoping to discuss something important with your lunch companions."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went on a recommendation.  I ordered a simple spaghetti with tomato sauce and meatballs, with garlic bread.  My husband ordered the same.  Never order any thing with meat balls.  They are bland and taste of nothing but processing!!  Sauce tasted like it came from a  can.  Garlic bread was so cold, I don't think they even bothered to heat it.  We sat in the back of the dinning area,  there was a very nasty smell in the dinning area.  Smelled of old rotting food from a over flowing garbage can in the dinning area.   We were not impressed and well we will not go back again"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself has almost a casual cafeteria vibe, but I go there every time I pass through the area. The food is quick, cheap and DELICIOUS. The portions are great as well. I have only ordered one thing, but I've tasted a lot of friends' meals. Everything is top notch. Delivery + drive through as well."}
{"text":"I stopped in on Friday after driving from Chicago to visit my sister at school. We were looking for something fast, comforting, and above all else, cheap. Za's definitely fit the bill. I got a heaping portion of spaghetti with tomato-cream sauce (my one weakness), fresh garlic, basil, and sun-dried tomatoes. It came with a big piece of garlic bread and I paid like 80¢ extra for some extra parmesan and sauce (for dipping my bread) but even then my dinner was under $10. 
We took our dinners to go, so of course it needed a little re-heating once we got home (I like my food to be burn-your-mouth hot) but it was delicious and extremely filling!
My only complaints would be that they were a little stingy on the toppings and the inside of the restaurant smelled a little bit like burnt cheese. The service was fine- typical counter service in a college town. I don't really care that they weren't super nice or engaging, since I was ordering to-go and the restaurant runs a fast-food type system. Order on one side, pick up on the other.  I wouldn't dock stars for disinterested employees at a McDonald's, so I won't do it here. 
I will TOTALLY be back. I already miss that sauce!"}
{"text":"Not too thrulled with they food. Pizza wus aight. I would not rite home to brandine about it. U have to rite down wut u want on a peece of paper and give it to the lady. I dont rite so good. But I do my best. U got a problem wit me?"}
{"text":"My husband went here tonight to pick up dinner. Not only did he wait forever, the dumb dumb running the register charged his card for $275 instead of $27.50. Za's is on the decline between changing their menu, upping their prices and hiring idiots that essentially don't have to even speak to people considering you give them paper menus. What could be so hard... and people want $15 minimum wage."}
{"text":"Went there today to get my favorite things and they've changed their menu, taken a lot of good things off and increased the prices.  Not to happy about this.  I probably wont be going back anytime soon since all my favorites are gone.  Very disappointed.  =("}
{"text":"Za's has probably has location as the best thing going for them.  They aren't expensive.. but they aren't dirt cheap considering what type of food they are giving you.  You have your choice of salad, sandwich (I don't say panini because it's not), personal pizza, or pasta.  Lots of options I suppose... but the quality is questionable.  The sandwich and pasta are okay.. but if you get a salad.. it's not very well mixed and they really don't give you much for toppings (you have to pay extra for any type of meat).  Also I got massively sick from their soup once.. particularly their clam chowder which I suspect had rotten clams.  So.. no soup for me anymore.  Oh.. and they also have desserts shipped from Cheesecake Factory, etc.

The tables are always a little dirty with crumbs, oil, etc.  So that's something I don't like.  Yes, there are a lot of people who go here.. and so the waiting area to pick up your food is a little crowded.  Also the long stairwell to go upstairs for additional seating stinks really badly.  I think it's because it's carpeted and the garbage is there.. so it is just gross.

Honestly I would rather go somewhere else on Green Street if I really wanted something to eat.  None of the food is too special or anything you can't make yourself at home for 1/10 of the price.  But it is a place that is easy for a big group of people."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, decently-sized portions (good for a single meal but not so much you make yourself sick or have leftovers), amazing flexibility in what you order, and the food is always satisfying.  I want a Za's where I live now."}
{"text":"I go to Za's on a regular (weekly almost) basis.  I like the variety of food available, how fast it is, and the cost.  The staff isn't friendly necessarily but hey, I'm not there to make friends, I'm there to eat.   They also carry Cheesecake Factory desserts!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, many choices of iced tea, reusable cups (with discounts), and fairly decent prices.  I like that it's an order-at-the counter type place, and the seating/atmosphere feels like a regular sit-down restaurant.

I had the Mama's Broiled Tomato panini with pasta salad on the side.  It was reeeeally good.  I have no complaints.  It was flavorful and filling.  I also drank about 5 full cups of iced tea while my boyfriend and I played Scrabble.  So, I was perfectly happy with my food and drink.

My boyfriend had a slightly less satisfactory experience.  He ordered a coffee with his meal, and the guy behind the counter said he'd have to brew some.  Ok, so we waited for our food to be ready and 10 minutes later my boyfriend went back up to get his coffee.  Not only was it COLD but it was also extremely watered down.  I don't know what happened but apparently the staff here don't know how to brew coffee.  The guy was nice about it and just gave us another regular drink.  But still, how is it even possible to mess coffee up that badly?

Za's isn't in a particularly convenient location for me to visit it very frequently, but I'm sure I'll find some excuse to come back.  I want another one of those broiled tomato paninis..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the customizable menu as it gives you a chance to sample their various dishes at a reasonable price. I got half pasta and a half salad and it was simply scrumptious. I wish their service was as good as their food though."}
{"text":"I love this place. Cheap, good food. 

The combo menu is my favorite, which allows you to order either two or three items (with a choice of 1/2 pizza, 1/2 panini, 1/2 salad, 1/2 pasta, or soup). I love that you can choose your own ingredients/toppings.

And a MAJOR PLUS - they serve Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes."}
{"text":"Honestly I really don't know why people like this place so much. It's incredibly overpriced for smallish portions, and just watching them make the food, you can tell not much thought goes into it and it's all just thrown together. Even the pasta is preboiled and just thrown back into the sauce. A robot could cook here and nobody would notice a difference. Save your money and eat somewhere else. The only good thing about this place is the tiramisu and the cheesecake, and Za's doesn't make either of these themselves. Skip this place!"}
{"text":"The employee handled my food with her bare hands and then put a plastic covered fork inside my box on top of my food.  This is not sanitary!  Please train your employees."}
{"text":"I think Za's is a good idea for an Italian restaurant. I like the different menus to customize your order, but it is really wasteful for every person that orders something to use a sheet of paper. I sure hope they recycle them. 

Unfortunately the food has been marginal at best. I've tried multiple pizzas, pastas, and salads hoping I'd find something that works but no luck. The only reason I kept returning was because it's sort of a \"tradition\" for my coworkers and I, but I've decided to not spend my money there when I can avoid it because I end up having to force myself to finish as much of the plate as I can. The portions are always far too large, but many people (Americans) will see that as a good thing. 

I can see this place being popular on campus when you need something filling and fast, but otherwise it's a pretty mediocre restaurant."}
{"text":"I really wish Za's had more locations!  It's cheap, the food is pretty good, and the service is sooo quick!

There are usually a million people there, and it's a great place to eat with friends."}
{"text":"I go to Za's for the atmosphere, not the food. The upper level has lots of seats and the decor is modern and clean. It is a very popular lunch spot and the queue can be very long. The way it works is get a menu checklist and check whatever that you want to eat. Then, hand it to the cashier and pay. Food will be ready for pickup at a counter nearby. Sandwiches, pizzas and pastas are decent but their cheesecakes are awesome. Sadly, they don't make those themselves."}
{"text":"I have moved from Champaign, IL to White Plains, NY. But still I miss this small town for its food.

Zas is by far my most favorite Italian place.
There serving time, hospitality and price are unbeatable. Tomato basil soup, Pesto pasta with grilled chicken and tuscan chicken pizza are my all time favorites. 
I have tried all other dishes as well, all I can say is everything is equally best. I miss you. Please open a place in New York."}
{"text":"Za's is my favorite lunch spot on campus! They have a whole menu of create your own salads, pizza's and sandwiches. I love the pizza's and would highly recommend one of them! The smoothies are awesome too! The inside of Za's is nice-there is a downstairs with lots of tables along with a whole upstairs seating section also! The desserts are worth a try after you eat your meal!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review
I am glad that I am back by Za's after moving back to Champaign. This was my favorite place to eat at on campus when I was a medical student. Now that I am back I have found out that there are multiple locations which works out well. The prices are actually cheaper than when I was here for college due to a modification in the menu. For the pasta you get to select from multiple types and sauces with 4 toppings for 5 dollars. The premium protein items i.e shrimp, meatballs, chicken will run you a dollar more each. The food is prepared quickly, however I don't know if they changed it now to use a convection oven/microwave to nuke your toppings which is one down side. This is then added to a pan with the sauce and served quickly. You also get a nice piece of garlic bread. All and all this is better than McD and for the same price. There are also other options such as pizza, salads, sandwiches etc. I have never strayed from the pasta

Pro: inexpensive, quick, large portions

Cons: microwaved toppings (i guess you get what you pay for)

Hidden gem:
Sign up for the perka app. You need to check in and tell the cashier so they can give you the punch to earn free food. I did not realize this and ended up not getting my first check-in. You can't just check-in which makes sense or people would abuse the system"}

{"text":"Za's is a casual sit down semi fast food place.The concept of this cafe is really neat. You can create your own dish, so if you don't like it, its your fault...hehe...I think there salads are great. I love the sun-dried tomato dressing.  You have many options here from pizza, pasta, panini, salads, etc. The only negative thing is that each dish lacks true flavor. They put the ingredients together but it doesn't have any spice and special touch to it. I recommend it because its inexpensive and good food for the most part."}
{"text":"Solid.

This place has had it's moments. I will say I like all of the options and combination possibilites (the ability to make your own pizza/pasta/salad/sandwich/etc), and how fast the food comes out. However, if I had to get lunch somewhere on campus, I don't know that this would be one of my first choices out of the tons of other restaurants in the area. I guess it's good if the people you're with are all hungry for different things?"}
{"text":"I just love this place!  My husband and I can go here and haggle over the Pick 3 for $10.  Like, I'll pick the soup, you pick the sandwich, and we'll each pick 2 of the 4 salad toppings, and then agree on the dressing.  VERY tasty and reasonably priced, and as healthy as you choose to make it."}
{"text":"I feel like the choice at Za's is almost overwhelming, and it usually overwhelms me into picking something simple and ending up really unsatisfied with it.  I dunno.  Za's for me is just kind of unclean and really average and kind of greasy.  Of the dishes I've tried, spaghetti and meatballs is my favorite, and I've never had a panini that I really loved. 

I suppose I'm not really into the fill out my order stand around and wait service model either, but that's really a personal preference."}
{"text":"Nice, more upscale feeling fast casual food. It has the potential to be pretty great but this location is a bit inconsistent with their food. The interior is nice though."}
{"text":"I really like the food at ZA's.  I've read other reviews complaining about portion size and being over-priced.  But honestly, I disagree.  In fact, I basically disagree with this nation's view on portion size completely...but that's another subject for another time.

This place offers something unique in that you get to choose what style of meal you want.  When you walk in there are 4 separate menus: Pizza, Panini, Salad & Pasta.  They also have a Soup and Kids menu.  To these you can also add whatever your little heart desires like garlic bread, soup, toppings, etc.  I also saw some nice looking dessert options (Cheesecake, Tiramisu, etc).  You mark what you want, then take your menu to the counter and pay (don't forget to get a drink!  It's not listed on the menu and everything is ala-carte).

Granted, it can be intimidating on your first visit since you won't be familiar with their selection options.  But there is space to stand aside and choose without feeling \"rushed\".  And for a preview of their menu, go to \"http://zasitaliancafe.com/\" ahead of time.

Something I learned from their website is that you can print the menu of your choice on-line and make your choices before you come in.  Or (if you have 5 or more orders) fax in your order ahead of time.  Great for avoiding the lunch-hour rush.

Now let's talk food: I LOVE the Chicken Carbonara sandwich.  Comes in 2 sizes: Traditional (large) and Thin (1/2 portion).  Nice thing is that prices vary based on size, not what TYPE of sandwich you get.  I've also had Barbecue Chicken Ranch Pizza and Sausage & Cheese Pizza.  They are small (9\" thin, cut into 6 slices) but mighty tasty.

I say it's good for groups, but it really depends on the individual restaurant.  This one on Neil St. has a back room that is partitioned off and made more private from the rest of the main dining area.  Can get a tad noisy, but as a free meeting space, I'll take the noise!

Overall, I have come back time and time again.  I really like the food.  I can eat by myself for under $8 and feed my family of 3 for right around $25.  Don't be intimidated, give ZA's a try next time you're in Cham-bana."}
