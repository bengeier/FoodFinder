{"text":"I live on the complete other side of town but luckily, I do some of my work near this place.  My coworkers and I came here once since we were close by and shared about 6 different flavors.  The wings were really well flavored, the wings were crispy and tender and the ranch (important) was excellent.  I didn't realize how addicted I was until I was on the other side of town and absolutely needed the Lemon Pepper wings in my insides.  I tried to satisfy my craving with the Buffalo Wild Wings Lemon Pepper (never again) and realized that not only was my craving not satisfied, but I had completely wasted the calories I had spent so hard burning in my morning Pilates class.  Lo and behold, I found myself making a 24 mile trip (one way, might I add) from Summerlin to the Northeast the following day looking specifically for my darling Lemon Pepper wings from Mr. Wings.    The lemon pepper is so perfect.  The wings themselves are perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I ate all my wings and proceeded to dip my bare fingers into the leftover buttery lemon pepper at the bottom.  I'm totally not kidding.  I take my sauce very seriously.  If Mr. Wings was single... Nevermind, this review is getting weird."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I've been looking for good wings in Vegas and this surpassed my expectations. Finally found my go to wing place. The honey bbq and mango habanero sauces are fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for 3 months. The food is great. Always hot and fresh I recommend you try flavor fusion menu. Cant get enough of this place they have me hooked they should make a Mr wings rehab!!!"}
{"text":"Battered tenders were off the chain! Good service as well. You can tell the manager knows what he's doin. Always fresh, major"}
{"text":"If you like good wings like I do ,Mr wings is the place for you!!  Try them all !! (Done that) you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"I cant get enough of this place. They are very good and i love when the mom and pop shops are way beyter than the top chain resturants. Very nice people working here and very helpful. Lol dont mind that its located in the hood but its still worth it"}
{"text":"UNBELIEVABLY:disgusting...This old chicken should have never been fried.. Bit into one of the pieces and spit it right out. Even the color of the chicken look distasteful. So this is how you services your customer.  Keep sending orders out like this and you want have any customers. I prefer tender an moist fried chicken.  Not old grayish looking pieces of the wings to hard to bite into. Even the spices were unable to hide the grayish looking pieces. This was my second time ordering your \"HOT WINGS\".  PERHAPS MY LAST."}
{"text":"For the Big Game, my wife and I decided we would give Mr. Wings a try as they were close to the house.  What a great choice.  Used their website to figure out what we wanted, and then called in the order.  Spoke with the owner, who was very friendly and helpful with helping me decide what to get.  We ordered wings with three different sauces, all of them very delicious, but the Asian BBQ was our favorite.  Also had their Garlic Parmesan fries, which were tasty.  When I went to pick up the order, met the owner, who was very friendly, and appreciative of the business.  We highly recommend Mr. Wings!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine just picked up carry out from this place let me say amazing!!!!!!  Extremely large portions.  They make the best Ranch. I can't wait to check this place out in person"}
{"text":"7.99 wing combo! Carribean jerk fusion wings. Garlic Parmesan fries. Tasty Ranch sauce. Absolutely love this place. Food was fresh and HOT."}
{"text":"We placed our order with a delivery service, The chicken was greasy and hand no flavor at all. Coating tasted like flower nothing else. Ordered garlic Parmesan fries and got plain. Also ordered the hottest wing but we're so soggy had to recook them in the oven to make them crispy. Don't waste your time with this place.. We through out almost all the food. Tried to give our cat some of the chicken and she smelled it and walked away.  KFC would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"Amazing wings! Best ever on my top 5 list of wings!  They aren't soggy, but crisp and the sauce and/or spice sticks to them.  They aren't overly cooked. The hottest sauce/rub is truly hot!  I loved it!  The fries are delicious.  It takes time to get order because it's cooked fresh!  So worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The wings and fries here are delicious. This place is worth the drive. I am on the other side of town but will drive here for their food. My bf and I ordered the parmesan buffalo wings with garlic parmesan fries. They have a sign that says \"you buy it, we fry it.\" You can buy hot food with EBT."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! The spicy buffalo sauce is  some of  the best I have ever had. Owner is very friendly and makes great food!"}
{"text":"Yes these are a must try.  All the flavor options you have to choose from you cant go wrong. You can even choose how cooked you want them-regular-well-or xtra crispy. It is in a mini mart and it's not the fastest service but it is fresh and made to order. Loved the coated fries. Am looking forward to the next trip to try some other flavors."}
{"text":"BOMB .COM, wings are delicious and omg the fries and the ranch are . I always go there when i crave wings. Thats the spot to go!!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! I live right by it and just tried it for the first time today. They deserve a better location instead of a little \"Hole in the Wall\" that you can hardly notice!"}
{"text":"Save your money and go elsewhere!!  I ordered for take out after work and let me just say it was the worst $26 I've spent on food! first of all the woman that I spoke to was rude and had awful costumer service. that should've been my redflag but I gave them benefit of the doubt. I had a flyer with prices and menu which was totally different from what they told me over the phone, so I decided to look at their online menu and the prices and combos were different as well (false advertising) (second red flag) I ended up ordering since I was already halfway there. When I got there the place looked dead, I walked in and let her know I had a pick up. I looked around and the place looked filthy and definitely not somewhere I would regularly go, but since it was my first time and the order was ready I didn't want to be rude so I payed and left, mind you that the whole time I was there the lady had an attitude while bagging my stuff, anyways as I was getting in the car I checked my order and I was so disappointed the wings were tiny not even half of a regular wing looked like, they were super greasy and the flavors all off. I regret giving them a try at all!! I should of known from the red flag in the beginning. If you're looking for good wings in Las Vegas please avoid coming here and save your money because all you will be getting is a greasy brown paper bag with tiny wings with soggy fries(disgusting)"}
{"text":"Super weak. The lime pepper smell like ass. And I found stuff in my food etc. if you do go please do not get lemon pepper ?"}
{"text":"I ordered with grub hub, bacon cheese fries and chicken tenders with fries- the bacon was beyond burnt and the fries tasted like they were under a lamp. The chicken tenders? Looked so gross my 4 year old and 6 year old wouldn't even touch it. Contacted grub hub, they said The restaurant refused to give me a refund, poor service. You sent me food that looks like it was old and it wasn't even warm more like cold. You suck Mr. Wings and I'll make sure none of my family or friends use you!!!"}
{"text":"With a name like Mr Wings, I tried not to set my expectations too high only to be disappointed. Originally, I was driving down Nellis and was thirsty so I just so happen to see this mini mart off to the right. As I pulled up, you cant help but notice the Mr Wings signage and my greatest weakness is to always find out if a wing joint is any good.  As I come in, this place kind of reminds me of Hamburger Hut off of Cheyenne just east of the I-15 in North Las Vegas. They share the same space as the mini mart. This location doesn't have any tables. Just chairs so you can wait for your order and take it to go.  I ended up ordering the 6 piece wings combo ($7.99). Comes with a half a pound of House Fries and soda. You can add a more wings for a dollar each. You have the option of flavoring your fries too for no extra charge. Flavors like garlic, garlic parmesan, lemon pepper, cajun, Jamaican jerk, salt n vinegar, seal salt and cracked pepper, Mr Bbq rub, southwest chipotle, and devil's rub.   I got the spicy barbeque flavor for my wings. The sauce was really good. It had a little sweetness to it followed by a decent kick of spice but not too much to the point you cant enjoy your food. The wings were a decent size and was cooked properly. I think next time I will request it extra crispy because that's how I prefer my wings on a normal basis. I just forgot to request it is all. For the fries I chose the garlic parmesan flavoring. I noticed the fries were battered. Not sure if this is normal when you select a flavoring or if thats just the way the fries are. Anyways, the way it was flavored was really good. Dip it in the ranch sauce they give you and you're set.   The only things that may have annoyed me besides the fact that everything has to be to go is that I originally wanted one of the fusion sauces (chipotle bbq which was bbq and southwest chipotle) for my wings. The lady informed me that it was two sauces so i couldnt order it. I mean honestly, how hard is to put two sauces together to form one? Technically that is one sauce when you mix it up. Lady still said no so whatever. Also after you order, they hand you the ticket order and have to go to the mini mart part to pay for it at the front counter.  Overall I am intrigued by this place. Cant wait to try all the sauces not to mention the different flavors you can get for your house fries. They also have sandwiches, wraps, chicken strips, and regular fried chicken. They are kind of in a shady part of town but dont let that stop you from coming here. Maybe come during the day?  Yelp 2015 Review #64 562 overall"}
{"text":"I'm only giving Mr Wings 3 stars because I need to go a few more times before I just give them 5 stars. I want to try different flavors of the wings & fries before I give a solid 5. The amount of sauce that's put on the wings is great. The honey BBQ flavor taste really good. The cheese fries were very tasty. I had a side order of lemon pepper fries and they were seasoned very well. The prices were decent compared to the amount of food you buy. Overall very good Wings but I want to go again before I give 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for some good wings. A coworker told me about this place so, I decided to try it out. I passed it a few times, as it is tucked away in a very small shopping center.   Walking, in I expected a normal restaurant set up. It  was definitely different. The display counter was pretty empty except for a few salads. But I heard the wings were good and I had driven all the way over there so I  ordered.The young lady behind  the counter was very personable and told me about different things on the menu. I eventually ordered,and I was glad I did. The wings were a reasonable size and price. They were good, but nothing spectacular.    If  I am in the area I would visit again. However, I would not go out of my way to stop in. The wings were pretty much like every other wing place."}
{"text":"For what you pay for, you can go to Wing Stop. They don't take orders past 9pm over the phone, not  a place you want to have to wait at after you order at the store late at night because of this. I only tried their garlic Parmesan wings (you must get 12pc and up to try more sauces) and fries. Their wings were soggy and extremely greasy, the flavor is very bitter. This place is half restaurant, half corner store. When I went they had one lady working the register and she was also the one cooking the food. Definitely won't be going back here, disappointing on such an easy order smh! Definitely sticking to Sunny's Chicken and Fish for wings! I recommend them to anyone wanting tasty, highly inexpensive wings."}
{"text":"Good customer service the lady that helped me was nice and great food specially for the good price,  That was the best chicken wings I've had in a while and the Cole Slaw was perfect."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the wings from this place last night. Great flavor and price. The fries were perfect."}
{"text":"Best wing place I found so far, perfect service, great taste, huge servings, love em!!!"}
{"text":"It was OK they have many sauces and dry rubs  to choose from but the  chicken could've been seasoned a little more the fries were good, prices a little high paid $30 for 2 12 piece meals which comes with fries and a can soda and I'm convinced unless you go to a national hot wing chain Las Vegas does not like blue cheese ranch everywhere"}
{"text":"Ok I would give 4 stars but where you wait for your food is hot and stuffy. The AC needs to work better. We ordered the 12 piece tender meal half honey BBQ and the other half plain and bacon cheddar fries. I do suggest not ordering plain cause you seriously only get plain. They didn't even have salt and pepper on them so you do get what you ask for. Well I guess you can pay with Ebt cause Holy hell it was busy cause it was the 1st of the month. We tipped them a 5 and paid cash for our order while all the rest of people in there paid with ebt and didn't tip anything. These people cooked y'alls dinner so at least you didn't have to slave over a stove. Y'all should have at least tipped something cause there was only one 5 dollar bill in the tip jar and that was from my husband and I... Sad!!! Overall the food was really good and will order from them again..."}
{"text":"You had ONE job: We ordered online spicy buffalo & got 2 diff flavors instead. Luckily it tasted okay, but NOT what we ordered. Not as crispy as I'd prefer, either.   I also requested the \"no napkins, trying to save the earth\" option you get on Grub Hub and instead got a shit load of napkins. Seriously, paying attn to detail would make your customers happy."}
{"text":"I ordered the $7.99 wing combo with the Caribbean Jerk fusion wings, the Garlic Parmesan fries and a Pepsi. The fries were DELICIOUS. The wings were good and cooked properly but not what I was expecting them to be. They were sweet and no spice kick to it at all. I ordered the Spice Level to be 4 which is Habanero. Didn't taste anything but sweetness. I would highly recommend this place just because the fries won me over. Haha."}
{"text":"It might look a little sketchy, but you cannot find better fried chicken, wings or chicken strips anywhere. Order ahead of you're in a hurry. Honey BBQ is my favorite. Try the house fries."}
{"text":"Omg... I was so impressed. I live 5 mins  away from thus place. I drive past it everyday. I wanted some wings and I originally called wing stop and it was a 86 min wait so I said eff' that I got on yelp and found Mr. Wings. When I got that food back home I was ON LOVE!!! every thing was so good and flavorful...Usually when I go to wingstop the next day I have really bad diarrhea but that's a sacrifice that I used to make because I loved the lemon pepper wings. This wings was sooo good and I did not have Diarrhea the next day they are awesome definitely my new wing place !"}
{"text":"I recently stopped by this wing place because its right down the street from where I work and I absolutely loved it! I ordered the spicy orange chicken and it was soo good. i love the fries as well! its a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! The chicken fingers rival that of Hamburger Hut's. The mango habanero wings are good too. Service is kinda slow, but don't expect too much and you should be alright."}
{"text":"I love  it just the Limon pepper need a little bit of improvement but other than that all the wings are good especially the buffalo parmesan that's my favorite one I wish you could eat there too but other than that this place is so good I love the customer service"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad order but what are these? Not chicken wings more like half pieces of mini wings. 35$ not happy. Not even the right flavors.   Come on guyz!!! Not going back"}
