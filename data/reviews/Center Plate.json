{"text":"Fried zucchini was over done and under done all at the same time. Good thing it was free with the yelp checkin special. 

I had the special of the day which was a hot meatloaf and fries. This was pretty good but it cost $9.00. Prices seem pretty expensive for the food you get. 

Wait staff was friendly and service was prompt."}
{"text":"Tacky and a smokey atmosphere should have tipped us off, but the allure of a Pittsburgh Restaurant Week menu led me to believe this was perhaps a \"diamond in the rough\" ... I should have gone with my first impression.  Our waitress couldn't handle the crowd and was obviously unable to handle the 5 or 6 tables she was given.  She was friendly, but her lack of service and forgetfulness made it difficult to enjoy her pleasantries.  The food was cold... So cold I had to send it back.  The soup arrived before the appetizer, which was quite odd seeing as if she talked up our apps so much.  The mushroom bisque was delicious, but the French onion left a lot to be desired.  Messy and over cooked, this soup was a representation of what was to come.  I ordered the stuffed shrimp and crab Mac for my entree, my boyfriend the surf and turf.  My Mac tasted like a box of Kraft Mac & cheese with Luke warm shrimp on top.  His surf was decently cooked crab cakes, but the turf should have been called \"tough\" ... Medium rare steak should not be that difficult to cut.  Also his mushroom risotto was undercooked and cold.  Finally we had a decent dessert to end our night.  Gobs weren't too visually appealing but tasty.  Overall I say the thing I enjoyed the most was our BYOB bottle of wine and the compensated $8 cork fee.  If you're looking for a tasty restaurant week option, avoid the Center Plate in McMurray."}
{"text":"Ahhh - we found you Penny!!! Center Plate is the ultimate breakfast spot! Best chocolate chip pancakes. We haven't had a chance to try anything else on the menu aside from most of the breakfast options but there are at least 5 different mac n cheese variations. Just go - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"You go for the soup!  
But you enjoy many other items.
Good homemade soup, my associate said.  
They specialize in home cooked comfort food with a twist.  
Meet me for lunch.

The Spicy tortilla soup was Oh So Good.  Nice spicy flavors with chicken, onions, green peppers slices and other veggies. 
The Crab Cake Sliders were very good.  A sauteed crab cake come on a mini salted pretzel bun with some tasty chipotle mayo, bib lettuce and a couple of slices of tomato.  The crab was jumbo lumped crab and did not have any filler :)!   Was very tasty!

The wait staff was very friendly and busy.  Handling refills and checking on any requests.  

The restaurant is in on old house that has been a few different restaurants.  The room has been painted a few bright colors along with some wide blue strips.

A hostess stopped by a few times.  Finally, asked if she was an owner.  She introduced herself as Penny, a partner, who had a Southside restaurant.  The chef is from the same Southside restaurant and has won awards for his soups.   Learned that CP is making food from scratch.  

They seemed to really enjoy what they do!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.  The spinach pie appetizer was fresh and flavorful.  My husband had the bacon burger with fries and he enjoyed his meal.  The fries were \"boardwalk\" style.  Very tasty.  I had the buffalo chicken Mac and cheese.  It was ok.  It seemed like the noodles were mixed with sauce and served.  It was never baked together.  Tasty but not exactly what I think of when I want Mac and cheese.  Will go back though, the menu had other things that I want to try."}
