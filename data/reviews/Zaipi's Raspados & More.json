{"text":"Exemplary customer service and an awesome restaurant with amazing tasting treats! Love spoiling myself and the boyfriend here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The raspados are yummy and the staff is always very friendly.. My favorite is the raspado de nuez.. The fresas con crema are good too."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!! The fresas con crema y nieve are the bomb!!!! So is the Hawaiian!! I will definitely be returning ......."}
{"text":"I been coming to Zaipi's for a very long time. I LOVE THEM I started to go since they first open a location on central in front of a Catholic Church. The owners are really friendly and if you don't know what to get they will give you a really good idea of what to get. I love their Cachanilla  is really good sour and not to spicy. I will recommended this to everyone. I have taken ppl from Hawaii and from South Carolina and they never experience something like that and they loved it."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love the food in every way. Though it's really hard to want to go back seeing as these kids behind the counter constantly talk about their guests in Spanish. I'll probably give it another shot but I would enjoy this location more if the staff wasn't constantly making fun of their guests as if no one understood them."}
{"text":"I've been going to Zaipi's for a while now even when they had the location on central. The workers are always polite and the prices are reasonable. It's very clean inside and the environment is super friendly. Not to mention that they sell thrifty ice cream!"}
{"text":"After seeing a few pictures online and then realizing that this place is right down the street from my house I wanted to come in and give it a try, I ordered the elote covered in Cheetos and Cheetos covered by an elote because the Mexican in me decided that this was the best idea everrrr! I will say that this was sooo yummy, my only complaint would be that the corn to me almost seemed like it wasn't ready to be picked. So it was pretty hard and didn't have much of a corn taste to it. So overall I would have wanted better corn, it won't stop me from coming back though. Still delicious"}
{"text":"Corn wasn't cooked . Really hard to read the menu. Clamato had no flavor really disappointed, considering everything I saw on previous photo ."}
{"text":"Very good drinks. Authentic mexican style. Place is clean. Pleasant staff. Reasonable price. wife was craving and the drinks were perfect. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Staff is nice and friendly, all the snacks and drinks here are amazing and creative. One of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Fresh, good, easy. They tend to open late sometimes but super worth it to find them open"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that being my first time here and trying the pi√±a loca mix was a good choice. Why made it a good experience was the fact that the employee who serve me(he was wearing a black cap/black shirt with tattoos) he was so nice and made me feel welcome. Not just that but he didn't rushed me through what I wanted to get. So thank you for that. Can't wait to try the rest and thank you for the extra home made powder."}
{"text":"I've never had raspados before this restaurant and now I love them! The staff is so friendly and awesome at explaining all the items on the menu. I've had a vanilla cream raspados with pineapples and leche dulce, a strawberry raspados with coconut pineapple ice cream and strawberries and coconut shavings in it, and I've had the nachos supreme. All of it was so delicious! I'm excited to try more!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for authentic Mexican candy, treats, and food around the West Valley for months. Found it on Central Ave in Avondale.. best place ever! Fruit is always fresh, amazing employees, the list can go on!"}
{"text":"awesome little snack shop. The nachos and mangonadas are my favorite. My family loves coming here. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great experience here, was craving the tostielote and I ordered a small mango raspado. The server was really nice and my order didn't take long at all. Worth the trip over to Avondale."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to trying this place but i waited till 11:15 am sign said open and opens at 11 but no one there and was closed so I ended up eating at don ponchos.   Should keep it professional and open store when it says it opens."}
{"text":"Too over priced, bad quality, customer service fair. Overall not what it used to be in the beginning i dont mind paying a high price but provide the best quality for each item."}
{"text":"Saying We loved this place is an understatement. The workers are so kind .. especially when you don't know what to choose.. they help you out and don't make you feel like a burden. The Hawaiian and the Fresas Crema with coconut pineapple ice cream is what we got and both AMAZING! Clean environment and everything is pretty much done up front for your to watch.. which is always awesome. Overall, wonderful experience and absolutely will be back!"}
{"text":"Another hidden gem of Avondale. My husband has been looking for good raspadas since the lady in Tolleson passed away and this has met every expectation. =]] We have been a few times over the last couple months and definitely has become our favorite sweet tooth fix."}
{"text":"One of my biggest cravings during my pregnancy was a Raspado (shaved ice with unlimited choices of fruits) and our usual place closed for the winter. I was devastated! We tried another place and the quality was just not the same fruit was bad, some of the things in the raspado were stale. I had almost given up and thought I wouldn't have one until after having the baby.   Thanks to Yelp, I found this wonderful wonderful gem of a place. The staff is friendly and the location is clean. The fruit is fresh and everything is done right. I can't remember the appropriate name for what I had, but I will describe it.   A mango smoothie, the bottom of the cup had chamoy (tamarind sauce), it was topped off with fresh mangos and a tamarind candy stick and other tamarind candy. It's absolutely delicious. I hope to make a couple more trips here next with with my husband so he to can enjoy it!!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! The staff is so friendly & helpful. I've been here twice & both times I've been able to tell them what I'm in the mood for & the have made it, even if it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"Everything is so good. Love supporting local businesses. Try it out!! Clean, fresh and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Wow! Very friendly staff and patient the Raspados are awesome I lived the fresh fruit!"}
{"text":"First time here but everything was great. Thrifty ice cream for the girls and I had a Loki Loki.. whatever they call this spicy cup of awesomeness. I'll probably get it without the crunchy things on top but the wife and I have been searching for these cacahuates/chamoy/Mexican dessert cups ever since the Dbacks game last year."}
{"text":"I love everything here I recommend it I've been a customer for quite some time now. Being from Los Angeles I was trying to look for a place that had great raspados  but it was very hard to find out here in arizona so when I found this place I was very happy and the staff is friendly everything on the menu is good and the price is great...."}
{"text":"Good stop when I'm on the west side. Just like they make them in rocky point. The kids can get a thrifty ice cream if they are less adventurous."}
{"text":"Everyone must come here! The food/snack selection can be overwhelming, but just take a moment to let it all soak in! I've had ice cream, nachos and other stuff I can't even pronounce! Staff is friendly, place is clean. No bells or whistles, it's low key as to not take away from the product selection."}
{"text":"...and now they make bacon-wrapped hot dogs!?  I'll take 10, please and thank you!  I guess I was a little late to the hot dog party, so to speak.  I wish I had known sooner.  Zaipi's is now my go-to place for cheap, kick-ass hot dogs.  In my opinion, these guys make a much better hot dog than Short Leash in Phoenix.  You can go here and pay $2.50 for a superior product or you can go to Short Leash Hot Dogs and pay $10.00 for a mediocre product.  It's not a difficult decision."}
{"text":"Service is always fast, usually nice. The food is typically great, I've been here about 6 times and only once the food wasn't good."}
{"text":"No les recomiendo este lugar muy caro y aparte no tiene mucha variedad y todo es artificial nada es natural no bueno"}
{"text":"The ladies were so nice and helpful. Service was fast and the food was delicious. Family time the kids enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Twice made the trip out here looking for a raspado. Both times they were not opened when their sign stated they would. So frustrating and unprofessional"}
{"text":"Addicted! Strawberry Fresca colada is my pick but everything is so delicious. You need to try this place out if your looking for some comfort yummy Ness"}
{"text":"This place is great, large variety of menu options.  Love the creamy with shaved ice. We visit this location at least once a week for a cold ice cream treat. The banana split is awesome, my kids love it!!  The price are also very reasonable. Great place to go during this hot summer."}
