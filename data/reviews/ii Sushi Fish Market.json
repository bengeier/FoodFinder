{"text":"Although there's seating area here, I find majority of people come here just to order take out. I usually order the sashimi and sushi party trays. A large (approx. 80pcs) cost around $65, which I find is very reasonable, especially in the area. Usually if you wait there for your take out, the chef will make a hand roll free of charge for you to enjoy while you wait. Its a very nice touch. Most importantly, the service here is friendly and the fish are fresh."}
{"text":"Came here for some sushi and found out that have a new owner now. They have reorganized the restaurant which makes the place more spacious and more seating for customers. The menu pretty much stayed the same as before. Affordable prices with great food. There were three of us and we ordered a medium Sushi and Sashimi boat. The fish are fresh and sweet. The quality is better than most sushi restaurant out there. The owner was very generous that they have given us a grilled salmon head and glass noodles on the house. They also offer 13% off when you order take out and pay cash. For the same reason, most people go there for take out. We were there for 1.5 hours and there were people coming in and out continuously getting take out. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Nice sushi takeout joint. Friendly chef and waitress. Good quality sushi. More economical compare to typical Japanese takeouts. Up in richmondhill anyways."}
{"text":"I needed a quick take out lunch so popped in here to grab a maki roll. Previously this was Kim's Ichiban. They re-organized the restaurant so there is more seating. I was not a big fan of Kim's before but based on the roll I ordered, I feel the quality has gone down. I ordered the Double Spicy Salmon with 10 pieces for $11. It was supposed to come with spicy salmon, avocado, cucumber, topped with spicy salmon and fish eggs. No avocado, they stretched it so there is 10 pieces, and the rolls consistency was horrible. Sub par to AYCE or even food court. I hope the quality becomes better."}
{"text":"For a total of 5 adults, we ordered their XL lovely boat - this came with 110 pieces of a combination of sushi, sashimi and rolls for $96. That's a steal! It came in 2 boats, one with sushi and rolls and the other with the sashimi. It comes to about 22 pieces per person, just enough for dinner. Overall, I was impressed with the presentation, quality and selection especially for this affordable price. Going to go a bit more detail below...

For sushi, I was surprised there were 5 pieces of uni sushi, topped off with gold flakes! It was creamy and fresh tasting. For sashimi, I really enjoyed the scallops, mackerel (along with the roe), and ebi (sweet shrimp). There were 3 rolls, mainly in the base of the dynamite roll with unique toppings. One roll came with cream cheese, and normally, I stay away from cheese rolls but I enjoyed it!

ii Sushi also offered many 'side' dishes on the house which included miso soup, salad, edamame, japchae (Korean glass noodles) and a grilled salmon head. 

If you're looking for a casual, quick, affordable Japanese meal, I would recommend this place! I saw they also serve bento boxes at $13, and the portion is generous. However, do note the place is small (roughly 4 tables) and wouldn't be ideal for romantic nights. All in all, would I come back? Most definitely, especially for takeout to parties/potlucks/lazy dinners."}
{"text":"Favourite sushi joint effective immediately. The service  was great and price was reasonable. Don't need to go to ichiban again."}
{"text":"Tucked away inside Times Square is this jewel. It's a quiet place with maybe 6 tables. Menu was very simple, but the smell of grilled salmon fills the restaurant. 

We ordered a small love boat (it came with uni) and were surprised with plates of banchan as well! The food came out quick and tasted amazing. 

Sashimi and sushi were fresh - my favourites includes the scallops and shrimp sashimi. They gave us a plate of edamame, japchae and salmon head on the house to start before our sushi boat came in. 

Service was wonderful. The sushi rice was perfect and I would come back to indulge in the sweetness and rich tasting fish."}
{"text":"Loved it! This place can easily be underestimated. Decor It is a small restaurant with a few tables but worth the try. We ordered the small lovely boat ($43), which is enough for two people. The quality of the food was great, as every piece was fresh. We're usually really picky with the Uni, but they definitely nailed it!"}
{"text":"Had some pretty nice sushi, good rolls, and ok miso soup. Some more miso would be nice. I ordered Everyday Special 6 which comes with a spicy salmon roll and 6? 8? I forgot. pieces of sushi. My friend had udon and a dynamite roll. Personally I think the dynamite roll could have less cucumber, but that's coming from someone who thinks cucumber doesn't belong in sushi rolls. The seafood udon was very good, having many different types of seafood like oysters and squid. Overall, a 4.5 out of 5, but the previous reviews were quite negative, so I chose 5 stars."}
{"text":"This was previously Kim's Ichiban.  It was our go to place for ordering take out Friday night dinner or sushi trays for house parties.  The new owner changed the layout so that It's now more spacier with a few more tables which encourages customers to eat in.  The menu has a good selection of bento boxes and rolls.  We came here twice already within the last 2 months.  The first time here we had 2 bento boxes, AD1 Sashimi and Sushi box and AD5 Unagi and Sashimi box which were only $13 (all day price).  You also get complementary green tea ice cream.  The salmon was fresh and tasty but the other fish was only okay but they do give you a very generous amount and I do like having the combo of sashimi and unagi.  On our 2nd visit, we had the Chirashi which wasn't great but the Salmon Tataki roll was delicious.

It's definitely a place that we would come to on a regular basis as the prices are really reasonable and there are some really good dishes."}
{"text":"I like the food here. When we came in the store, they will give us the free miso soup. The food was so fresh and tasty. The boss talked to us which I like this feeling so much. The boss is a friendly guy, I will come here and try again.

I will come here again as I like the environment here which is so friendly to talk to each other."}
{"text":"Food super good with reasonable price. Got this sushi boat for $33, plus 2 free spicy Salmon hand roll (one each) from boss. Also free miso soup, glass noodles, and green tea ice cream. Nice service good environment. Would definitely come again!!! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I've worked in the area for a couple of years but I've never been tempted to try this sushi shop. Finally, one of my colleagues tried it and recommended it to me. She said it was decently priced, quite filling, and walking distance from our workplace.

My partner and I each ordered a lunchbox special (~$10). While waiting, we were looking around and saw the menu of sushi trays on the wall. We were talking about switching our order since I was super hungry and didn't think the lunchbox special would fill me up. I did see that the chef was already making our bento boxes. Our server overheard us and was very friendly, said he would talk to the chef to see what he can do. They were willing to accommodate the change, despite the fact that they had already started prepping our order. Wonderful service.

We got our tea, miso soup, green salad and glass noodle first. The taste of it was pretty standard. Glass noodle was a teensy bit too salty, but still tasted good and I finished it. We also got ice cream at the end of our meal. 

The main attraction arrived pretty quickly; timing is very important for me since I only have an hour for lunch. Honestly, I was not expecting this place to be good. But the salmon was fresh, the avocado was perfectly ripe and the sushi rice was well flavoured. My partner (who eats a lot) and I couldn't finish all the food and even packed some for later. I would return again for lunch and would recommend checking it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I have not yet had a sit down yet - this review is for their takeout. TL:DR, the staff is great, the sushi is great and price is great! 

I've ordered take out assorted 100pc sushi/sashimi multiple times before for parties. The sushi/sashimi is pretty diverse, but has a lot of the \"mainstream\" more tame things that kids and beginners like. The sushi is delicious, and sashimi is nice and thick with no gross fishy aftertaste on the salmon (which is very important for my siblings). The arrangement of the platter is beautiful and well thought out. Pick up for take out is always on time and made fresh - even when you call a few hours in advance.

Staff if absolutely wonderful! They even gave me a complimentary hand roll and half a grilled salmon head one time. I called once to reschedule a pick up, they missed the call by a few seconds and they called me back. Love that! You can tell that they really value their customers. 

My go-to for sushi takeout :)"}
