{"text":"I've been missing Mermaid Cafe somethin' fierce and have been craving a place to get a coffee at 8:30am when I'm headed to work just a few doors down. I've only tried the cappuccino so far and it was tasty. Looking forward to trying the food next time."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 4. We called ahead asking if we could make reservations since we are on a bit of a time constraint with lining up babysitters and they said they did not take reservations and that \"Tuesday night isn't very busy.\" We arrived at 6:30 and the place was packed. We had a delicious drink at the bar as we waited for tables to clear out. It is a very small venue and only 2 tops were set at the time. A group of 8 came in and informed the server that they had reservations. We heard this and informed the waitress of what we were told about reservations. The waitress did a great job at addressing our concern and accommodated us within a matter of minutes. Before the 8 top. Which was great. After speaking with the 8 top more they DID make reservations and informed the restaurant why they should be able to make reservations. So, if you push hard enough they'll take a reservation!  The food was delicious. I was put off a bit that there wasn't a menu online since I like to look over it ahead of time. It's a small menu, small places but all the delicious deliver BIG flavor. We ordered 2 orders of Brussels sprouts, salmon dish, potatoes, pierogi, escargot and all the desserts. No plate left the table without being finished!   Would love to see more meat dishes on the menu and a limited number of reservations accepted each night."}
{"text":"Typically I wait a few visits to Yelp about a new spot. Not this time. I've been waiting patiently for a restaurant like this in my neighborhood, and was intrigued from the moment I heard that Chad Vogel (the genius behind the also-awesome Robin Room) was opening up an actual restaurant. Far from cookie-cutter, this place is poised to be Madison's cutting edge trend setter. But happily, it's all within the boundary of approachable food at a reasonable price point (hand rolled agnolotti for 10 bucks?! escargot for $13?!) and the drinks menu features both experimental cocktails and old standbys. Plus an extensive selection of wine and beers.   The intensely Instagrammable wallpaper is only one facet of Mint Mark's perfectly appointed decor. Verging on tiki bar but keeping it classy, the exterior is welcoming while the interior is cozy without feeling crowded (the open kitchen and copious plants help). We sampled a few menu items while enjoying our cocktails. The potatoes are pure salty crunchy goodness. The biscuit, served in an adorable Staub cast iron pan, is addictive, subtly sweet with a velvety crumble served with tangy cultured butter and garlic honey that adds the perfect hit of savory. The Mish Mash was a hearty plate of terrine, pate, cheeses, grilled bread, and accompaniments- I especially loved the currant (?) preserves and the pickled mushrooms. For dessert, we had a Breton gateau with a deliciously balanced tart cherry sauce and a decadent cremeaux.   A vintage soundtrack full of Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan was a great backdrop (if a teensy bit loud). Our server was enthusiastic and timely, and all in all, I'm excited to make this a new standby.Bravo to Mint Mark for nailing it even after only being open a week.They took their time to open and clearly that time was well spent."}
{"text":"Visited Mint Mark with family shortly after they opened. Really impressed! The menu is simple but special. Decor is fun and classic, vibes are laid back but sophisticated too. Menu favorites were the biscuit, kale salad and cauliflower. Order the cauliflower before they run out! I don't even like cauliflower, but this stuff is amazing. Interesting beer list and thoughtfully crafted cocktails. Service was great. Overall, really enjoyed it! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Didn't have food, just came for the cocktails and man are they good!!  I had the mule  And the Tried Prims Cup  (I think that's the name)...it is to die for! Refreshing and just the right bite!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with some friends to try out a new place. First impression was of a place that I wasn't sure I'd like. Wait staff is super friendly! I tried a Bloody Mary, and it was okay. But when we ordered (got the broodwich and the Mexican pizza) everything was very delicious. I would highly recommend this place for brunch. Demographics of this place are younger and hipstery. I hear their dinner and drink menu at dinner are awesome too!!!"}
{"text":"Best cinnamon roll in Madison! No dryness. Light vanilla bean frosting that isn't too sweet. Large enough to share. Delicious!  I've been to Mink Mark three times now and will definitely be back.   Went for the first time on a Saturday night. The wait was long (around an hour) but the host was friendly and didn't seem overwhelmed. We were able to put our name in and head to another spot for a drinks. Sat at the bar by the kitchen for dinner. It wasn't the best spot for four people but we made it work. The owner greeted us himself and was very personable and warm. He explained the menu and told us about his favorites. He was preparing burgers for late night (haven't done this yet but will soon!) and explained the process to us. We shared a few things but were most impressed by the biscuit (silly, I know). The charcuterie was also very well done. The mussels were recommended by several people but we didn't love them.   Also, the space is adorable and unique. Love the wallpaper! Busy at night but seems to be slower for brunch. Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here for a quick bite while waiting for One Barrel to open on a Saturday. I'd been wanting to try this place for a while because it's owned by the people who run Robin Room and Johnson Public House and I'm a fan of both places.   We ordered an iced tea and some grapefruit juice to start. I really enjoyed my iced tea; I find that at a lot of places, iced tea ends up just watery tea water but the tea here was flavorful and refreshing. My boyfriend's grapefruit juice tasted really fresh (and I'm sure would taste awesome with some gin...). We split a slice of coffee cake and the Mexican pizza, Taco-Bell style, which is a couple of fried tortillas, refried beans, a fried egg, jalapenos, chipotles, and cilantro all stacked up together. It was super, super satisfying and just the right amount of food. The coffee cake was perfectly warm and crumbly and had a yummy layer of blueberries at the bottom. Our food came out quick and we ate every bite.    Since we were planning on filling up with beer right after, we didn't order the cocktails but we'll definitely be back to try them -- they sounded delicious."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place: the ambiance, staff, and most importantly, the food!  The interior is trendy and colorful without being overwhelming. Beautiful!   I got the vegetable omelette that came with the potatoes and ordered a side of biscuit and sausage. The omelette was excellent. The vegetables were vibrant and provided a fresh flavor and texture to the omelette. The potatoes were crispy and even though it is fried  it didn't taste greasy or oily like other hashes. Surprisingly, I thought the biscuits were just okay. Don't get me wrong, they were yummy, but didnt really blow me away. Wasn't as buttery or flaky as other biscuits I've had. It was actually a little dry! Maybe I came on an off day? But, oh my goodness, the sausages were the best breakfast sausages I've ever had! I don't know what it was. It tasted savory but not so heavy. It was just perfection.   We also sat by the kitchen/bar and it was such a treat to watch the staff cook. So talented!"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing place! It's like Neverland for your mouth .... I can't express the attention to detail on the experience.. from the cocktail to table...we have a winner! Don't come here with children but come ready to impress your date. I love this place and there brunch on Sunday is absolute. My only regret is rating this place so high you guys might take my table ...FUGuys"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and it was pretty good. We didn't get any food, so can't really speak to that. I got a great cider and the atmosphere is really great. I gave 4 stars because the bar chairs are really uncomfortable and they don't have many gluten free options."}
{"text":"Came in here after a few friends told me about the new spot. And I have to say it lived up to the hype. Great service and great cocktails. It's nice when you can get a custom cocktail made for you in a timely manner."}
{"text":"This was a great experience. The plates are smaller, so between two of us we ended up ordering 4 plates, the biscuit and a dessert, and I just reached full. The plates came out as they were ready, so it was a steady flow of food. The cocktails were great, with some interesting twists on classic drinks. Everything we ordered was full of flavor and each dish had its own unique flavors. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Meh.    its pretty cool but way over priced for Madison,WI     Will run its course"}
{"text":"Cozy, friendly place. Sorely lacking in vegan options. Great cocktails, good staff... just don't come here looking for plates that don't have animal products on them."}
{"text":"I don't come to Madison very often, but when I do, I check out new restaurants. Living in Los Angeles, I am surrounded by unfriendly people. I received a hug as soon as I arrived and I left with a warm smile. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here today. We sat facing the kitchen which was a really appetizing and enjoyable experience. Pretty much everything they were making looked delicious.   Today they had a breakfast sandwich with bulgogi, kimchi mayo and an egg. It was such a good sandwich. The sweetness of the marinade was balanced with their homemade hot sauce. The sandwiches change every week so I'm sad I may not get another taste of this one but I also feel like you can trust them to come up with another great combination of flavors. We also tried their coffee cake and bread pudding. Both of these were great. Coffee cake was not too sweet. The bread pudding nicely savory.  The staff were so friendly. I really liked the bright decor of the place. It looked like a great spot to come back for a late night drink and snack."}
{"text":"Above and beyond on all their dishes and drinks. Can be a little pricey but well worth the quality you receive. The fish fry is to die for and one of my favorite brunch spots! A new staple to the neighborhood that I hope stays forever!"}
{"text":"A very cozy little spot with a great cup of coffee, and some seriously killer biscuits! I'm guessing they're made in house...they are so good. My husband enjoyed one with some jam, and I got one of their sandwiches (the name is escaping me). It had a perfectly fried egg that oozed all down my hands the second I bit into it, pickled jalapenos, sausage - pretty much, it was perfect. We will be making a trip back soon to try their dinner!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. We went on a weekday for coffee and a light breakfast / bakery item. Had a cortado, brewed coffee, scone- all were excellent. It's a little confusing to go in on a weekday morning - where do you order? Do you wait to be seated? I'm sure this would be much clearer on a weekend for brunch or any night of the week when there are more people there. BUT- either we did it right (order at the bar and take a seat) or the staff is just really good at rolling with it, because we were served quickly. Good spot for coffee."}
{"text":"This is such a welcome little refuge in the wasteland that is The East Washington, Winnebago neighborhood! Walk through the door and you are instantly comfortable whether you choose the bar, a table or the 'chefs counter'. I give the coffee service in the morning an A. Dinner an A+A+A+!   Check it out and it will quickly be your new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner with the family. LOVED everything. (My husband jokingly proposed to the chef, he loved it so much.) Fantastic food, cocktails and ambience. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful interior design: inviting and elegant. What a transformation from the space it used to be. The drinks are wonderful and the food is delicious. They have a wide array of liquor and could probably mix up anything you desire. Staff was very attentive for the large group I went in with, going out of their way to accommodate us in the fashion they did. It was only my first time in there this past week, but I can already tell that I will be a frequent customer. Keep up the amazing work!"}
{"text":"SO good!!! Amazing food and drinks.  Such s lovely place.  The biscuit is to die for for, the pimento cheese is the stuff dreams are made of, and don't get me started on the breakfast sandwiches!!! Hands down , one of the top breakfast sandwiches in town!  Let's not forget the adorable wallpaper!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, awesome service, wonderful environment. I had the broodwhich, recommended by wonderful waitress who refilled water and coffee several times. Simple standard breakfast was $40 with tip, so a bit on the pricy side. Plenty of seating on a Saturday 10 am in a small restaurant, suggesting they may be charging just a bit too much."}
{"text":"The Chimera breakfast sandwich was very delicious. The balance of just a perfect biscuit with a perfectly cooked egg and divine sausage made for a wonderful experience! Highly recommend this place. I also enjoyed the Jasmine Pearls hot tea, great aroma and flavor. Can't wait to try this place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"The food was amazing the atmosphere was great. We sat at the Chef's counter was super fun best night out I've had in awhile"}
{"text":"Gotta say. This place hits the mark. Opening night, mint condition. The service is wonderful: Trav and Angela tonight. I would come here for them, but might as well enjoy a beverage while you're at it. I recommend the Trinidad Sour. It contains the orgeat.    Ambiance makes one feel like... Miami 30's and 90's. You and your grandma will feel at home.  Manske's beautiful art installation trellace awning is awe-inspiring. If I were a vine.  Good spot. Great spot. Do this."}
{"text":"I came to Mint Mark to check out the hype and was really impressed by the drinks and service our bartender gave us, but not much else. To be fair, the food was all tasty, but overpriced and under-portioned. I know, I know...it's small plate focused, but we're talking tiny tiny portions for the cost. We'll definitely be back for drinks, but will likely stick to Heritage Tavern to get our small plate fix in the future."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to stop by Mint Mark since it opened and finally got a chance for Sunday Brunch.   First of all, I love the interior. Especially in gray Wisconsin March, it's nice to see their trademark green wallpaper. It's a stylish and comfortable place to be.  Secondly, their menu is amazing and the actual food lives up to expectations. My friend and I shared the Salmon Rillettes and Lemon Ricotta Flapjacks. Both were delicious and perfectly portioned.  I can't wait to try Mint Mark's dinner some time! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A new favorite, especially for dinner. Possibly more consistent than Forequarter, but with less of a unique flavor profile, but easily in the top tier of Madison small plates restaurants (along with Forequarter and maybe Estrellon, Pig in a Fur Coat if you haven't been).  Brunch in general feels like classed-up and not ridiculously heavy versions of traditional favorites. Their homemade hot sauce is outright fantastic.  Only thing I haven't been overly impressed by are the desserts, which are decent, but not exciting."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new breakfast spot to check out and stumbled across Mint Mark. I absolutely loved the interior decor, and found the place cozy! Very retro-pical! ;P We walked in (kiddos and all) clearly new to the place and the guy at bar greeted us. He was kind and was quick to explain the ropes--self-seated, order at the bar, and water is self-served. Food was good--ordered Sunday morning sandwich and matcha latte. But the potatoes in the breakfast bowl blew my mind! I don't consider myself a potato person, except fit my love of McDonalds fries (which stays with me from my childhood). Texture was on point and I never had them cooked like that before. They also had an unlabeled hot sauce, which tasted/looked tomatillo-based. I wish I would've confirmed whether or not it was house-made because it was pretty good! Definitely interested in trying their lunch and dinner menus!"}
{"text":"This is a trendy little place with a very fun atmosphere. They have amazing breakfast and delicious small plates for dinner. Their drink selection is fabulous! We had Travis and Andrew as our bartenders and they were the best! Very friendly and attentive, with good suggestions for the drinks and food. The plantation punch was my favorite, we will be back again very soon, thanks Mint Mark!"}
{"text":"The bartender on Monday night was great. She was friendly, checked in on us often enough to be helpful but not too often to be pushy, and even looked up how to make a drink my friend requested that wasn't on the menu. I'd definitely be interested in coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Sooo good! We ordered 1) mish mash: cheese, two pâtés, preserves, mustards, pickled vegetables. 2) escargot: lemon, butter, pastis, fine herbs. 3) pierogi: house made kraut, mushroom, caraway jam. 4) cauliflower: bagna cauda, golden raisin, crispy cheese. 5) terrine: fisher farms pork, pistachio, fig, mustard. 6) made to order chocolate chip cookie with butterscotch ice cream. All ridiculously delicious. Damn you Mint Mark."}
{"text":"With the recent cavalcade of amazing reviews (both on Yelp and in the press), my girlfriend and I had high hopes when we stopped in on a recent Friday night.  Unfortunately, Mint Mark did not hit the mark for us.   As I longtime fan of the Mermaid Cafe, I must admit they did a great job with the interior redesign.  While it can be quite loud at times (as it is basically one big room), I loved the tropical elements and overall vibe of the place. Their menu is based around small plates and with a somewhat limited menu to begin with, we were disappointed that two of our options were already sold out.  We opted for:  Kale Salad Loved the tonnato sauce that it was dressed in as well as the croutons but the cold poached egg didn't do it for us.   Escargot The grilled bread (from Stalzy's) was great to dip into the lemon butter  but felt that the addition of pastis to the dish made the escargot taste earthy and unappealing.    Mushroom ragout Served over roman gnocci, this was a failure.  The dish was largely flavorless with the ragout truly tasting like a jar of tomato sauce and the mushrooms almost non existent.  The jury is still out for me on this.  Perhaps a stop for a drink and a sampling of another item is in order but not quite ready to plan a dinner date until I know the food and execution is more consistent."}
{"text":"Brunch food was decent, Bloody Mary's were a HUGE let down. Should be embarrassed to serve this in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"The food and cocktails here definitely wowed me, this might be my favorite meal in Madison. Came here with a group of 4 and we ordered all the non-meat dishes on the menu. Of the 11 items that were on the menu that day, only 3 contained meat; very vegetarian friendly.   The dishes are meant to be shared so come with a large group and order everything. One of my favorites is the biscuits. It comes out warm and the edges are gently fried and drizzled with honey. For dessert don't skip out on the warm cookie topped with brown butter ice cream. Everything here is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"My son brought my husband and I hear after we went out to eat. This place is a gem! The vibe is so perfect like you're far away on vacation and the drinks only use the most incredible and unique Liquors. I learned how delicious a Tequila drink called a Paloma was...  and I couldn't resist the old fashioned sweet coming out of the spigot in the wall! Can't wait to keep having Adventures here"}
{"text":"My friends and I just spent two hours eating our way through the menu (we literally ordered everything on the menu except for three things). And we all agreed that this was the best dining experience in Madison that we have ever had (and that's saying a lot). I know their menu changes, but as of now their biscuit and their gnocchi stole the show. But seriously, everything we ordered was the best version of that particular dish that we had ever eaten. I'm not exaggerating... at all. Even more surprising is the price. We did not hold back (like I said, we almost ordered everything on the menu). Plus, we all had 2 to 3 cocktails with dinner. Super reasonable, and we all left feeling full and satisfied. That's typically my biggest gripe with small plate style restaurants. It ends up being expensive and you have to share with everyone so you leave not even feeling full. I have to add that the Golden Girls style wallpaper and super cool vibe made the whole experience even better. This place is not your run of the mill nice restaurant. It has a personality of its own. Not to mention the staff was super nice, efficient and professional. I absolutely cannot wait to go back to Mint Mark. I miss it already."}
{"text":"The food is extraordinary.  The biscuits to die for. However, they really need more space. Last evening the small dining area was all reserved for a private party so we had to eat at the bar on very uncomfortable stools. Since the non profit next door is moving I hope they acquire the space and expand."}
{"text":"Mint Mark truly has it all and does it all very well.  The service is fantastic and the space is just gorgeous - one look at that vibrant wallpaper and you know you're somewhere special!  Their daytime coffee, tea and light food items are carefully crafted and delicious.  My chai tea latte with oat milk was the perfect warm up on a snowy afternoon and my husband's Kin Kin slow drip was one of the smoothest coffees I've ever tasted.  Their evening menu offers creative cocktails, a unique beer list and seriously amazing food.  Over the course of our few visits we've snacked on the roasted potatoes, cauliflower, kale salad, biscuits....and more potatoes (highly addictive!).  The flavors are all spot on and portions are the perfect size."}
{"text":"Awesome to have this place take over after Mermaid closed.  Love how they redid the seating layout.  First meal and cappuccino were delicious!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the food and service only -- I don't know about the drinks because I don't drink alcohol but I hear it's mighty tasty!   Where to start?! The food is amazing! I was definitely hesitant about trying this place out because it's small plates style but WOW! I would say most of the food is a bit heavy but the portions are perfect between 2-3 people, because you can't really overdo it unless you get a lot of plates (which I usually do anyway, but worth it!). Their chef deserves an award because I've tried so many new food that I didn't think I would like and then I do! I also love that their menu change slightly with the seasons--it only makes sense. Some menu items do stay though, such as the biscuit, which I would highly recommend! It melts in your mouth! I love the Mish Mash (cheese and charcuterie board) as well -- their bread is buttered and grilled, so yummy! The cauliflower is also amazing! If you have room in your tummy for dessert, DO IT! I haven't been disappointed in any of the desserts, except for when they take it off the menu! Everything is just really flavorful! Way to go, Mint Mark!  Their service has always been on par -- never have an issue. Just a tip: dine in early if possible because they do get packed pretty quickly! They don't have a lot of table space but their bar area is absolutely beautiful. They have the best decor in my opinion. Highly highly recommend Mint Mark!"}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful atmosphere. We ordered the mussels, the biscuit, the prochetta and some cocktails. Everything was cooked to perfection over a wood fire grill. You could taste all the sauces and the fire. It was an amazing experience and highly recommended."}
{"text":"You walk in, bar to your right, seating to your left, separated by a cool divider that is more lattice than wall. Up side--fun, sophisticated visual. Down side--does nothing to reduce ambient noise or air flow, particularly from that door you just walked in. On a cold wintery night, room temp was very cool--maybe mid 60s? That was not so fun. The seating area is lined with a pew-like bench, facing small tables and chairs. They should take a hint from Gib's and pad it. Chairs are wooden coffee-shop style uncomfortable. So, atmosphere--looks great, but not a place I'd want to linger. Maybe that's the point, as I'm sure someone's waiting for a table.  Food is made up of small plates, \"meant to be shared.\" My favorite type of eating! Server recommended 4 to 6 plates, but for two middle-aged people, four was easily enough. Some of the plates seemed slightly overpriced, particularly a white bean dip with bread. Note that plates will rotate, which is both smart (keeps locals interested) and unfortunate (predictability and favorites may be missing). Luckily this week, my vegetarian friend had most of the menu to choose from. Menus were short on explanation, which meant more questions for the server.   We choose pieorgi, a mushroom dish with ragout, a kale salad and smashed potatoes. The potatoes were fabulous, served with a garlic aoili. Pieorgi were fine, not excessively heavy, although I doctored them a bit with the leftover garlic aioli as the accompanying dots of sour cream were quite tiny. The mushroom dish seemed kind of like a meatless marinara sauce. I liked the kale Caesar salad, but as I have had a sublime one made by a friend and would have suggested letting the kale sit in the dressing a tad longer. Didn't care for the very soft-boiled egg on top, coated in Parmesan shavings. Four dishes, three drinks ran $60, which seemed fair to slightly overpriced.   Drinks were nice, although my Moscow mule was full of cracked ice, summer lemonade style and as a result, seemed weak.   Service was attentive and awesome, generally bringing one plate out at a time, presumably as it was ready. It allowed us to mix and match bites. Our server was attentive without being overpresent and was truly 5 star, from helpful hints to checking back about second cocktails.  Overall, I'd say don't believe the hype. It's decent but lacks the touches that truly make it justified for the price."}
{"text":"You know it's good when you think \"When's the next time I can get that again?\". That being the cauliflower, which was the bomb.com. It's kind of pricey at $10 or $11 but uh...I can't make cauliflower taste like that so please take my money!   My dining companion ordered the Mish Mash which is a plate with four half slices of bread, two cuts of cheese, various meats, and some pickled veggies. I always think plates won't be enough but the quality of everything on the MM plate was superb and it was the perfect amount for two people to share.   Still, I kept returning to the cauliflower. It was that good!   I'm excited to introduce this restaurant to others. I had a lovely dining experience. I went shortly before 5pm on a Thursday and the tables filled up within 20 minutes.   Mint Mark, you done good.    Update: I went back to try out the Friday Fish Fry which was bluegill. It was tasty and came in three pieces, lightly breaded with salt and black pepper. It's kind of pricey at $17. Comes with a potato (choice of fries or baked potato). My baked potato came it with nothing except a little salt sprinkled on top. Unfortunately, cauliflower is not available on Fridays because they have to use the deep fryer for the fish. Will have to return for the cauliflower some other time.   I've had a few cocktails and my favorite so far has been The Southside, a green gin drink."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like Mint Mark since we love the Bristol in Chicago. Sadly, although the food was quite good (some dishes almost as good as the Bristol), the management of the restaurant was so frustrating as to really color our meal.  Breakdown:  Food: 4/5 Drink: 2.5/5  Service: 2.5/5  The food was pretty inventive and some dishes were very tasty. The highlight was the \"surf and turf\",  a perfectly done scallop paired with a blood sausage with a texture strikingly similar to the scallop. However, the serving was a bit dainty, two scallops would have been better since the ratio of scallop to sausage was uneven.  Other food notes: Kale salad - excellent sweet croutons; kale could have been massaged more so it was less fibrous   Charred broccoli with Meyer lemon- amazing smoky flavor, could have used a little more lemon and the broccoli could have been a tad crunchier.  Salmon rillette on nutmeg muffin- delicious smoky flavor, muffin melted in your mouth   Ravioli- pasta was cooked perfectly. Mustard green filling was a bit overpowering, it would be better as a pistachio-mustard green pesto filling for a little more subtlety and complexity.  Escargot- very tasty, buttery lemon sauce with charred bread to soak it up  Roman gnocci with mushroom ragout- the worst dish we had. The gnocci, which is cooked like polenta, was a flavorless blob, the mushrooms were nowhere to be found, and the ragout tasted mostly like tomato sauce.  Dessert -  basque cake: served as a slice not an individual cake, and you could tell the slice had been reheated quickly since it was a bit burned on the edges. But amazing flavor- basque cake is what the Bristol is known for so nice it's featured here.  Posset- cream and sugar set with blood orange acid. Tasted like a creamsicle. Needed a bit of mint or something else bright on top for garnish.  Now, drinks: a disappointment all around. Completely uninspired cocktail menu and a shabby beer selection. Saving grace was that the bartender was happy to mix a drink off-menu.  Finally, service -- when we called to see about reservations (they don't take them, which is a bad move given the size of the space), the hostess told us if we came at 6 on a Friday the wait would only be 15-20 min. Apparently she told everyone else that too because when we showed up it was completely packed. She told us the wait would be 30-40 min but we weren't seated for an hour and ten minutes. By the time we were, the restaurant had almost emptied out.  The food was brought out all at once, although it's small plates, so we felt incredibly rushed to eat everything quickly before it got cold. Even though we waited for over an hour for a table we were done with dinner and dessert within forty minutes. Water wasn't refilled either and we weren't asked if we wanted another drink until we had finished dinner. Our waiter was very nice and it was clear the restaurant was just understaffed and the floor poorly managed. But the extremely poor service was so frustrating it was very hard to enjoy the meal.   In sum -- food is good, we really hope they get their act together with the service and get a new mixologist."}
{"text":"We visited during a Wisconsin Distributors event. There were 6 of us in our party and we were REALLY lucky to get a place to sit, as the restaurant got pretty packed quickly. This place is pretty small and doesn't have a whole lot of seating for parties larger than 4! The beer and drink options were good and priced well for the Madison area. But, the food was so disappointing! We were sampling beers, so we decided to order a few different items off the food menu to share with the group (as appetizers). This is a small plate place, so be ready to order 2-3 things off the menu for each person (if you want any type of sustenance).  I ordered a biscuit off the menu and it was one biscuit cut in half for $6. I was hoping to share with others, but everyone felt bad taking a piece of it because it was so small. Two others at our table ordered the pierogi with the intention of sharing. The pierogi order is 2 pierogi and isn't enough to share with others either. The salmon was served in a cup for some reason with a muffin on the side. My friend who ordered it was so shocked, she seemed to laugh at it for about 4-5 minutes before tasting it. She wasn't sure how it was supposed to be eaten. We all had our theories. The flavors for the items were not mind bending and were pretty basic too. I guess the small plates helped stoke our table conversation though. We all left Mint Mark shortly thereafter to go eat a full meal elsewhere in the Atwood area."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night around 9 and they were packed. It's a pretty small place so it wouldn't take much to fill up. The wait wasn't long but there weren't any room to wait. And with the rain outside, we stood awkwardly between the door and the divider of the dining section and bar section. Eventually a server brought us to an open spot for two at the bar. The setup is really cute, the color scheme and theme very light yet cozy. Other than the small space, they managed a casual comfy ambience and open decor.  Drinks are delicious. Consider the people on the other side of the bar more of mixologists than bartenders. They seem to enjoy their creation and make it an art than simply pouring drinks in a glass.  Food is okay. They mainly had small plates for dinner. But nearly half the menu was no longer available by the time we got to order. But they also have burger and fries for their late night menu, which unfortunately I did not get to try. But the few items I did were pretty good. I'd come back to try the other items I missed or whatever new items they come up with since their menu changes frequently (according to their website)."}
{"text":"My review only speaks to the late night burger.  I visited around 11 PM on a Saturday. There was an open table and a friendly and quick server.  The burger was perfection and came with just the right amount of fries. And the drink menu was great.  I think breakfast will be my next try. Can't wait to try a biscuit."}
{"text":"Go for cocktails and a couple tapas.  The menu is literally about 8 tapas and many are similar.  Get the cauliflower it's by far the best of them all. Craft cocktails are delicious!  Very tiny portions though so you may leave hungry, thirsty and no richer."}
{"text":"Been here a few times so far and love it! Cocktails are subpurb. Staff is friendly and helpful and the food is awesome!  Stopped here last night (April 9th, 2018) for my birthday. Ordered about 5 tapas and finished with the most amazing sea salt chocolate chip cookie!! As a bonus, one of my all time favorite treats is the good ol Chocolate Chip Cookie :-)  Location is great. Decor is unique.  Insert thumbs up here."}
{"text":"Pretention of the server did not match quality of the food which was unexciting and somewhat bland. I didn't even finish the doughy pierogi, which is unheard-of from this Polish girl. Had high hopes for this place but besides the killer (overpriced) biscuit and the lovely environment, Mint Mark is not a great choice for dinner. Go for a cocktail and a biscuit with a side of pretention and call it a day."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love this place!!! The vibe is different than any other spot in Madison. It's that one place you take your out of town friends to wow them with our city. The drinks are fire and the service is amazing. The loss of one star comes from the food.   Again, let me start by saying the food is amazing! I've had the biscuits, the pirogies, and burrata toast. Their pirogies are stuffed with curry like ingredients. It's a combination I can't believe I've never seen on a menu. But that's what makes this place special. Mint Mark combines amazing flavors with comfort foods to make a pairing you can't resist.   So, why only four stars instead of five? If I could give 4.5, I would. The portions of some dishes are quite small. Both the pirogies and the biscuits only came with two pieces each. For $10 I expected a dish I could share with my friends. Not something I wanted to hoard to myself so I could indulge in the goodness.   In short, go to this spot! Go. Go. Go. But bring your wallet if you want to fill your belly with Mint Marks delicious dishes."}
{"text":"We went on Friday eyeing their fish fry and wanting to try the dinner small plates/tapas menu having coming before for Sunday brunch and enjoyed it.  What we ordered: Bluegill Fish Fry, Triangoli, Malfatti, Pimento Cheese, Pierogi, Arancini, Biscuits --- Bluegill Fish Fry($17): The portion was 5 good sized fillets(bear in mind that Bluegill is a small fish) that were lightly battered and perfectly, and I mean perfectly seasoned. This fish fry is not a salt bomb that will have you reaching for water ever 2 bites which was great. What was not so great was the measly side of tartar that came with the fish. If your someone who's used to tarter with every bite of fish fry your going to want to request an extra portion on the tartar.  Triangoli($12) - These triangle shaped raviolis, hence the name \"Triangoli\" were a favorite of mine for one simple reason, brown butter. Brown butter for the uninitiated is when butter has been melted down and the resulting liquid reduced to impart a rich brown color and nuttiness to the butter. As you may have guessed this goes great on all manner of pasta and is well complimented by a classic filling of spinach and ricotta.  Malfatti($11) - this is another pasta dish that comes to the table piled high with sausage and pesto mixed in which adds a great hit of acid and prevents this dish from being too heavy with a good hit of acid.  Pimento Cheese($6) - As the menu description says this has \"all the cheese\" as well as a nicely charred \"toast\" bread to spread the cheese onto. If I had any complaints here I would just say that the cheese arrived at the table cold making it harder to spread on the bread then we expected. All around a solid dish.  Pierogi($10) - I have yet to meet a pierogi that isnt doughy and lacking in the flavor department and sadly this Pierogi was no exception. Filled with homemade sauerkraut and mushrooms you would expect an umami bomb. No such luck this dish lagged behind everything else I had in terms of taste by a wide margin. As for the caraway jam you either love it or you hate it.  Arancini($8) - The first thing that comes to mind for me when I think of Arancini is Dry. This arancini was is the exception. I attribute its superbe flavor and lack of dryness to the garlic fonduta filing which prevents the rice from drying the fried ball.  Biscuit($6) - Right off the bat this was one of the best Biscuits I've ever had. It came to the table nice and warm with a buttery richness that doesn't disappoint. But wait theres more, because this beatiful biscuit comes topped with a garlic honey that compliments the biscuits richness and really makes the dish one to remember. Be sure to get every crumb! We ordered this last and it worked great as a dessert. --- Service - Service consistently falter throughout the night and is why I can't rate 5 stars. While we had no problem getting a table and getting our food in a timely manner the other essentials of a good experience were underwhelming. The water we got is best described as very room temperature. With lots of small plates and different types of dishes it's key that plates are cleared in timely manner, they weren't. By the end of the meal we had a stack of dirty dishes at the end of our table that the server seemed oblivious too until we ordered the Biscuit."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for drinks and small plates. A mai tai was exactly what I needed to chase winter away!  Bartenders are friendly and helpful. They get creating a comfortable experience. The biscuit with garlic honey and cultured butter was perfectly savory yet sweet and textured just like my granny's.  My husband ordered the meatballs with spatzel and kraut. The four crispy outside, tender inside balls were deliciously seasoned. I was full after sharing these 2 dishes. Although I wouldnt have objected if a second biscuit showed up. Cost was $17,50 for my half. Dessert menu didn't charm me tonight. Atmosphere is cool and open without being pretentious."}
{"text":"Very good food and a positively adorable atmosphere and decor. My one piece of hesitant feedback is that the portions are incredibly small. However, the onion tart was delicious enough that I can unequivocally endorse the restaurant, small portion size or not."}
{"text":"Nice interior, fun and kind of 70s. We stopped for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The coffee and latte were great. Unfortunately, the mexican pizza had sour cream, which was not listed on the menu. My husband hates sour cream! No one checked on us during the meal and we had somewhere to be, so he suffered through it. We pointed it out to the server at the end and she just asked if it was a problem (yes, but nothing more done about it). The hipster toast had great flavor, but was a little overpriced at $11 for one piece of toast and one egg, no side. We'll come for cocktails, but this won't be on our short list for breakfast."}
{"text":"It's a sweet looking place, but a sea of gluten and fried food, nothing green on the menu. I suggest at least one salad."}
{"text":"Have been to Mint Mark several times for lunch great service, food  and friendly people. Went for the Fish Fry recently  with friends that we told about the place.  We were not impressed. Bluegill was  overdone -  coleslaw was bland and baked potato was  dry no butter or olive oil.  We had to ask for some olive oil  Waitress was ok- at best. The ambiance is great."}
{"text":"We had the cauliflour, biscuit, potato, and chicken liver mousse. Everything was AMAZE (even the chicken liver pate...who knew?!?)  We also shared drinks: Spring G&T, Southside, Pimm's Cup, Mojito, & Lions Tale- my favorite was the mojito, but there's not a single one I wouldn't recommend. This crew has done a top notch job!!!"}
{"text":"I'll just say it right away. The food is amazing, and you should eat here ASAP. It can be crowded and very loud (not my favorite atmosphere), but so worth it for so many reasons:  1) The place is super cute. Miami-style colors and woodwork. From what I gathered, they pretty much gutted the place and made it fabulous on their own. 2) The cocktails. If I understand correctly, there are ties to the Robin Room, known for its fierce mixology, and the cocktail mastery you'd expect is evident at the Mint Mark. I do believe I recall seeing our bartenders from tonight at our visit to the Robin Room. These folks know what they're about when they lay hands upon a shaker. 3) The food. It is, in short, super yummy. They offer small plates that are each a concise ode to every featured ingredient.  Our table was a mixed group of vegetarians and animal eaters. We all were enchanted by the dishes chef Sean (Shawn? I didn't get the spelling, but he is a cheffy bad-ass purveyor of yumminess) put up in front of us. We were lucky enough to secure seats at his bar where he takes care of you personally. We were spoiled tonight, without a doubt.  We ordered a selection from the supper menu, including escargot, kale salad, the Friday fish fry, the mushroom, the onion tart, the pierogi, the biscuit, and for dessert the Basque cake and the skillet cookie.   For those that ate them, the snails were a hit. Chef (handsome and tatted) said the dish hinges on good snails. I've no clue what that could possibly involve, but there were exclamations about the garlic and butter, and the snails themselves.   The kale salad was also well-met, but the dressing involves anchovies, so only the snail-eaters enjoyed it.  We weren't clear on what a vegetarian version would be like, but my guess is that capers would be a fine substitute.  The fish fry platter hit all the notes you'd expect from the dish. Fish, fries, and slaw. One of our group mentioned that the fish got lost in the frying. We snuck fries from the plate, and they were double-fried perfection.  \"The Mushroom\" was my favorite thing among all the super-tasty things. Roasted garlic, shallots, parsley and bread crumbs were the perfect back-up dancers for king trumpet mushrooms served in the most adorable of skillets. Not only could I eat this dish all day, but I aim to reverse engineer it at home. Best mushroom-centric dish ever. Chef said he was just puttering. This dish should be a permanent addition.  The onion tart! Spanish onions in custard and baked in a super light and flakey pastry, served with a hypnotic red wine sauce. We were so happy that the snail-eaters handed their order of this dish over to us (they were otherwise engaged) because we devoured ours all too quickly. Pro tip: get extra red wine sauce to sop with their grilled bread that comes with the fish fry. You will be loving that. Even better when it's snagged from a friend's order.  I am not a fan of cooked cabbage, but the braised (I assume) cabbage served with the delicate pierogi is a treat. Nutty, pickley, and deep red, it goes so well with the sour cream and sprigs of dill that are served with the lightly pan-fried packets of potato-filled fabulousness. I could use a bit more of a sear on the dumplings, but that is total nit-picking.   Much to my consternation, the biscuit is better than mine. The husband covered my ears as he proclaimed this fact out loud to chef Sean/Shawn. The honey and whipped butter with a hint of garlic. I just knew that the flavor and texture of the biscuit were going to be excellent when I picked it up, and I'm both thrilled and bitter. There's probably a word for that in German.  I am looking forward to our next visit!"}
