{"text":"for one, when we first walked in they asked us to pick a table (which is fine)... We tried, but all of them were set up with water stains and dirt on the tables. When we got to ordering our drinks, the menu said non alcoholic daiquiri for 5.50, we received our drink and it had alcohol in it. On top of that, they charged us 7.95 for each one. When I got to drinking mine, there was a hair on top. I didn't finish drinking it cause I didn't wanna make more of a fuss. When we ordered our pizza, we were on the second slice when my friend literally pulled out a blonde hair out of her mouth. Both of us are brunettes, so you can do the math there. When we complained, they made us a new one AND charged us for it while insisting that we said we wanted a new one and don't give out free food. Worst experience ever. Left hungry, disgusted, almost vomited on the street car and disappointed in this kind of customer service. I've never had an experience like this ANYWHERE. I will be telling this story to my friends and family. Good luck everyone :/"}

{"text":"I'm just gonna come right out and say that I think Cafe Dip is absolutely the most overrated place in Toronto.  I caught onto their lackluster food offerings long ago, but for years I allowed myself to be dragged there by friends that were drawn to the patio.  

It has been common, in my experience, for every single order at the table to be screwed up in some way.  'Oh, you wanted whole wheat pizza dough and your friend ordered regular? Well, we just decided to switch it for you, and get your toppings wrong.' 

As is probably indicated, I have been very disappointed with the pizza here, mostly because they never get my order right but also because the crust is too thin to stand up to the weight of the cheese and grease of the toppings so it gets soggy and floppy fast.  Their minestrone, with its paltry sprinkle of pasta tubes underneath a flavorless broth, doesn't even meet the expectations of canned soup, let alone a traditional Italian dish. The potato puffs that they serve with their mediocre breakfasts must surely come from a freezer aisle. As for the pasta, the sauce I want never seems to be available but I'm also adverse to paying for non-fresh pasta as a restaurant meal.

I could go on but I feel that this place has already occupied too much of my time.  Instead, I have finally taken a stand and will no longer agree to spend time or money there.  Thankfully, Toronto has thousands of other places to sit outside and drink."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Not so great food. Nice outside patio, however.

Granted, I ordered a BLT. However, I asked to have the BLT pressed like a panini. I got two slices of white bread toast with lettuce, tomato and bacon. The bacon was good, though. I also asked for french fries with my sandwich. They never came. I even reminded the expo that brought our food that I was supposed to have fries. He said, \"OK\" but never bothered to bring them. 

Our \"too cool\" waiter wore his sunglasses the entire time he waited on his customers. Not cool in my book. He never refilled our waters and never brought us the check. We had to go inside and ask for the check. 

What a disappointing Italian place in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Not the best place for a calzone. The sauce on the inside is too light.

If you order extra sauce on the side for 1.00$ more, it's still not enough marinara. Also, the marinara is a bit too light and sweet.

Only 1 type of cheese in the calzone: mozzarella.. Where's the ricotta??! Common now, mates. 

Step it up a couple notches, eh. 

3 stars for good service and an excellent location, -2 for the poor quality calzone."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try out Cafe Diplomatico for awhile since it seems to be such an establishment in Little Italy and the patio is packed in the summer. 

I was expecting this place to be great but I'd have to agree with some of the other Yelpers - it's overrated. 
The crab and lobster dip didn't taste like at all like lobster or crab - it was more so like a cheesy dip.  My friend and I didn't even finish half of it. 
My chicken parm with pasta came warm and was cold before I was half way through it.  The chicken was nicely fried but lost some of its crispiness due to the fact that it seems to be sitting there in the sauce before it got to me. I also found the pasta to be bland - the chili flakes were my friend.  Needless to say, I was disappointed and wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Service is always great I've never had anything so far that was disappointing always very good and the best Tara Massoud"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and the pizza is pretty good. 3 of us split a large (8 slices) & we were decently full. Speaking for myself, I was full off 3 slices, each of the guys had 3 slices and I think they were full? They also liked the $4 beer. 
The pizza is thin crust (my favorite) & we got olives, sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese. I was quite surprised by the amount of goat cheese on there; it's like, my favorite thing ever, so  I was a happy campy. My only \"complaint\", if you can even call it that, is that the tip of each piece (ie the centre of the pizza) was a little soggy. Maybe from the goat cheese? I like my thin crust a little crispier. Nevertheless, I enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and fun, relaxed atmosphere. Can be really busy at times. Awesome place to go to during the soccer World Cup as it's usually packed with soccer fanatics."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto.
The patio is fantastic. Extensive menu which allows you to create your own choice of pasta and sauce - you order what you like.  Prices are below average so overall this is a great value place. Over the years we have ordered just about everything on the menu and loved it.  It is family owned for multiple generations."}
{"text":"We were seated on the patio reall quickly, but that was the high point of the night. We were then ignored by our server for 20 minutes. 15 minutes through our wait, we asked a server if someone was responsible for our table. that woman then explained to us that our server always forgets about our particular table. She then informed our server that we were waiting. We then waited 5 more minutes, where she still did not make eye contact and completely ignored us, so we left.

It wasn't even that she was busy running around serving others. We saw her standing around leisurely several times."}
{"text":"Caf√© Diiplomatico or \"The Dip\", as most people call it, has been around for as long as I can remember. Back before West Queen West, College was the cool street and The Dip was THE SPOT for people watching. 

The food is nothing to write home about. Both cheap and inexpensive. It's mostly Italian; lots of  sloppy,, meat-filled sandwiches and iceberg lettuce with cream dressing. But that's not why people go. It's the patio baby.  The patio seats tons and it's almost always full in the summer. It's hands down, one of the better spots in the city to sit with friends for a pint. The service is decent, they serve late and the view is the best on the strip."}
{"text":"The staff that work here just ruin the place. The hostess was not rude to me, but any other person who was behind me was greeted by the rudest woman I have probably ever met. Our server didnt make eye contact (not even once) and seemed annoyed when we weren't ready to order drinks, appetizer and entrees all at once. Infact when she brought our drinks, I told her we were ready to order, and she rolled her eyes at me and walked away. She didn't bring our food herself, we had to ask for refills to 2 different people before they came. We had to ask for a bread basket because she didnt bring one.... We asked for the bill and even that took 15 minutes to come. This place was a waste of time. In the end, the waitress provided us our bill and wrote in pen \"15% tip = $$.$$\" and totalled it up for us. Yah right! We tip for good service.... we barely had service at all let alone good service! Save yourself a bad experience and try another of the many many patios on this street in Toronto.

What can I say about the food? Not much we don't remember it... the bad service is all that was memorable here!"}
{"text":"No. No. Just No. The food is bad. The service is atrocious. If I get forced to go here by friends I just order the sangria by the pitcher (EXPENSIVE) and drink my way through it."}
{"text":"The Cafe Diplomatico, or the 'Dip', is a cheap Italian coffee place / bar / restaurant on College Street. The decor is nondescript with soccer posters on most of the walls. There is a large patio which is pretty busy in the summer. The attitude of the place encourages socializing. Mains are priced from $3.25$12.95. The place is busy anytime after dusk.
The food is pretty mediocre - some of it better than others. Some of the service we've had in the past has been pretty appalling, but to make up for it the manager comped a bunch of our food and gave us all free dessert and coffee, so we came off pretty good. 
If you're looking for a place to sit and chat without feeling pressured to leave then this is a great place. Socializing is definitely the name of the game."}
{"text":"I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how this place is popular.

Sub par service and pasta and it's gross inside."}
{"text":"I can't believe anyone could give this place a thumbs up 
I ordered Lasagna and got layers of flat noodles with a sauce which
had no more character than Ketchup..
A disgrace to Italian cuisine.
If you want a beer and big patio to people watch it is fine but stay away from
the food!"}
{"text":"It was a decent Italian place. Its always busy so I guess people do like it. The decor is not for fine-dining its more of a casual setting good for groups, which there a lot of on my visit.
The menu has a good variety and you can make your own pasta! Service was quick and polite and the food came at a good pace as well. I was not overly-impressed by the food but for the price it was a great meal. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an Italian fix."}
{"text":"Skip the lineups and go to Dominos Pizza or East Side Mario's. Mediocre food and terrible service here. I guess they are trading on their old reputation and prime location. I  can't say enough bad things about this place."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


This is one of the better spots to hang out in Little Italy, if not for the food, then for the location and the buzz. It's good for coffee and conversation, lunch and drinks, or just enjoying this happening part of town. Late at night it becomes a bit of a hangout, where tans, big hair, and sunglasses get more focus than anything coming out of the kitchen or taps.

Constantly packed, trendy, and at a prime location, Caf√© Diplomatico could probably serve and charge anything and still have success. Pizza, pasta, and sandwiches are available in the $10-15 range, and are generally appealing and served with speed - once you're lucky enough to place an order. Their pizza is fresh and has many options. Don't be tempted by the Cafe Dip Lager; stick to your usual choice of beer.

Most people come here to drink, see, and be seen on this stretch of College Street. Expect a possible wait to get a patio seat when the weather is nice. Also expect service to be below average: they don't need you, and they don't mind if you know it. Still, it's a winner.

4 stars"}
{"text":"This place really embodies the spirit of \"meh.\" The food is meh, the service is meh, the crowd is meh...even the patio is meh. I think people just get excited about the patio because it's the only thing viably positive about the experience. 

It's not bad. It's fine. It's just...why would you go here? There are nicer, funner, cheaper places right on the same corner."}
{"text":"I really don't like the food here.  The only reason that I did not give it one star is due to the patio.  It's a great place to sit in the summer time.

I ordered the pasta and canned olives were placed in the dish.  The chef and owners should be ashamed that they could serve crap in Little Italy.

My advice to the owners and chef would be to take a trip to Italy and learn to cook Italian food!"}
{"text":"With an incredibly devoted fan base and an equal amount of people who say it's overrated, the Cafe Dip never seems to suffer from the controversy.  Check out its packed patio on a warm summer evening and tell me who the winner really is.  

I personally am an unabashed fan of Diplomatico, despite some pleas that it is overrated, overcrowded or just plain over.  There is nothing lovelier than a rainy Sunday inside bonding over huge plates of pasta, or sharing a pitcher over panzerotti on the patio in summertime.  The menu is full of all the Italian classics you would expect, and one of my favorite things about Diplomatico is the fact that you can get Amsterdam Raspberry Wheat ale by the pitcher.

You couldn't ask for nicer servers, although things can get a bit intense on the more crowded times on the patio.  Their brunch is reasonably priced and pretty popular, although I haven't yet had the pleasure.  I mostly go for their delicious carbonara, panzerotti, salads and of course, the beer. Try to go on off-peak times and learn from my mistake and try to manage to save room for dessert, something I have never quite managed to do."}
{"text":"I went today and I really liked the patio.. This was my second time in this place and I would like to come back.. The staff is very nice and the service is very good .."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy coming here. Food is good. Pizza is incredible. Always busy with good atmosphere. Simple layout and presentation in the restaurant, but being on a College St. patio is worth something for sure.

Great place. Will always come when in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe Diplomatico twice and the second time was absolutely against my will, so I just ordered a beer.  

I have no idea why this place is always packed.  The food is less than mediocre -- come on people, you're in Little Italy!  You can definitely find better Italian food!  The ambiance is a little trashy and the price is crappy for what you're getting.  

You know what frozen food pastas taste like?  You know, the ones you can buy at grocery stores?  I'm reminded of that."}
{"text":"Goood service and good food. Especially the pizza i ordered here was really good. Tips for the next order : Spinach and green paper  !love it! I would definitely visit again soon~  i like draft beers as well."}
{"text":"Great patio, excellent coffee (americano), cheap prices. 

Atmosphere: definitely not upscale, by any means. A very casual and down-to-earth feel, with mediocre deco, and really no ambiance at all. 

Service: Excellent, superb, unbeatable. Very friendly staff, including the kitchen staff and the manager. They talk to you as if they are talking to an old friend, and they are all always smiling and willing to chat if they have a free moment. I was there for approximately 3 hours, with the first hour spent waiting for a friend, and the waitress continued to check up on me anyway and even offered suggestions on what I could have with my coffee while waiting for the friend. Extremely fast food service, also. 

Food: There's definitely better food around. I had the daily special ($11), which was a chicken parmigiana, with pasta. Chicken was too salty, and only lukewarm. The spaghetti was slightly overcooked, and both the noodle and sauce lacked flavour. I had a chocolate biscotti ($2.50) which was also mediocre. However, I was able to dunk the biscotti into a delicious, addictive coffee. Their coffee is so deep and fruity, that I was tempted to order a second one were I not crazily reactive to caffeine. We ordered a sangria, which was just halfway decent. It tasted like fruit punch.

Overall: 1 star for the coffee (only the coffee; there are better food places anywhere else), but an extra star for the service. I really wouldn't mind just chatting with them over a beer! Regardless, future visits will only constitute of a coffee on the lovely patio. 

Fun fact: \"Chloe\" was filmed here (starring Julianne Moore, Liam Neeson and Amanda Seyfried)."}
{"text":"Towards the end of our trip, I realized that my friend and I had yet to explore Little Italy so we jumped on the subway and got there.

As we were walking through the neighborhood, the Italian alarm in me started to beep when I saw this cute cafe on the corner that looked promising for lunch.  So I dragged my friend there and as we got closer, I saw the patio seating outside.

However, since it was cloudy and we wanted to sit in the AC, we took a seat inside, where I immediately noticed all of the framed photos on the wall from 2006 when Italy won the World Cup.  The celebrations outside this cafe mirrored the celebrations in Newark and NYC so it was fun to look at the people there.

On to the food.  I had the special of the day, which was fusilli with a creamy sun dried tomato pesto/sauce.  My friend, for reasons I don't know, decided to order a BLT at an Italian cafe, but anyway.

For an appetizer we had a caprese salad (sliced tomatoes with fresh mozzarella, oregano, and drizzled olive oil).  And bread was brought to the table with butter.

The service was great with the waitress checking in on us numerous times (but not overbearingly so).  My friend enjoyed her BLT and I liked the pasta dish (it was a nice addition to an afternoon of walking around Chinatown and LIttle Italy).  I really felt at home in this cafe and I think other Italian-Americans in the area should stop and grab something here.

P.S.:  The bathrooms are downstairs and it is a funny setup but they were pretty clean so I won't complain."}
{"text":"What's up with Cafe Diplomatico?  We are regulars at this place in the last few times (5 or so times in the last 3 months) the food has been less than their usual fare.  They stopped using credit cards for a bit and only told us after the meal.  We've stop going and we'll see if the next time we go we'll continue or it may be our last time."}
{"text":"On Dec 27th, four of us went there at 5:30, three had chicken parmigiana and one pasta.
After 2 hours three of us started feeling sick, diaria and throwing up. I dont know if it was chicken or cheese on top of it, but when we called the res manager and asked for an asnwer she said she had the same food today and she is fine!
Although the taste was okay but something is wrong with this restaurants food quality especially chicken parm.
I took three of my friedns  who were visiting from Boston and this ruined their trip."}
{"text":"I'd give 4 stars for the patio and 2 stars for  everything else about this place. Works out to a solid 3 stars.

The patio is big and actually out in the open air rather than in a back yard or alley. The lights of the neighbourhood create a bit of ambiance. Not quite enough, though, to overpower the zillions of sports banners and totally boring beer selection. 

The beer selection is fully mediocre - a bunch of blah lagers. I suppose you could argue that they have a local microbrew on tap (millstreet organic), but being local doesn't mean that it tastes any better than most of the other mediocre lagers. 

I was in the market for somewhere pleasant to sit whilst enjoying the company of a rarely seen friend, and the dip didn't disappoint on that count."}
{"text":"Got pulled from the street by a friendly host - he convinced my girlfriend and I to come inside. I had the diplomatico sandwich and a side of fries; both were fine but hardly impressive. Americano was good and the service was attentive. You get what you pay for I guess - it met my expectations."}
{"text":"Great patio and cheap beer = good times. However, unless you love a lot of cheese I wouldn't recommend eating here. The layer of cheese on my pizza was thicker than the crust!"}
{"text":"After a frantic hour search for a bar at the stroke of midnight, we finally landed in Diplo.  We wasted no time grabbing a table out in the patio and our server came to our rescue and took our drink orders.  To go with ice cold beer, I decided to order their salmon burger (which I never tried before) but our server was honest enough to warn me it isn't that great so I settled with a regular beef burger.  At the end of the night, the three of us managed to take down a pitcher of stella and white sangria.  The sangria was pretty damn good.

Service = excellent
Food = decent
Drink = excellent

I can only give this place a three star since there are plenty of wine bars in the area that provides a better ambiance.  Diplomatico is basically lawn tables and chairs on the street.  Service is great here and I would not hesitate to come back again as the last resort if you are caught in a busy night and not know where else to go.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Two friends and I decided to eat here before catching a movie at the Royal.  I've heard good things about this place and the owner was out front trying to get people to come inside. I am guessing he's the owner because he was an older Italian gentleman among all the young lady servers there. He told us we could sit where we like and we chose the patio. The patio is great, big, spacious and has a covering in case it rained. 

Our server unfortunately was this 20 something lady who clearly hated what she did and did not want to be there. I've worked in the service industry, it's not always easy to be happy and mistakes happen but not only did we have to ask her to bring us water twice but she wouldn't tell me what cakes they had and I had to go inside to see for myself. Then I had to stop her and tell what I wanted and the slice of cake she brought back completely wrong. Once she corrected that and our food was brought to us she never once came back to check and see how we did. She really did come off rude and ruined the experience. We asked for separate bills and she still brought us only one and it took us forever to pay because we would flag her and she would ignore us. 

The food was alright. I'm sure there is better down the street. It was nothing special but still alright. It's a shame the server ruined my experience there. Not sure if I would go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was at Cafe Diplomatico for the first time last Saturday with some friends and it was the perfect kick off to our patio season. The patio is huge and gets great sun all day. We shared a few pitchers of red sangria which were delicious. The food is decent and inexpensive. We shared a couple pizzas and the caprese salad. All in all, Cafe Diplomatico gets a thumbs up from me and I will be back."}
{"text":"Here is the story. We were greeted nicely at the door and told to take a sit at the patio at any table we liked. So we did. The lady at the next table was smoking and the wind was blowing right at us, so we decided to move to a different table (Especially since we didn't order anything yet) Not a big deal right?  Wrong!! Some a$$hole manager-wanna-be came to us and said \"CAN YOU SIT BACK AT THAT TABLE!\"  There was no \"please\" or even a concerned why we moved.  We said we wanted to move because the smoke was bothering us. He said \"IT'S A PATIO, I CAN'T TELL EVERYONE TO STOP SMOKING\"  and asking us to sit back at that table. There was plenty of empty tables, I don't know why he insisted we sat to that particular one (they were all for 4 people). 

This was ridiculous. We left to a better place. 

Really, this place is sh*tty. There are much better placed in Little Italy with a nice patio too!!! Don't come here!!!"}
{"text":"This the THE spot in Little Italy.  Been around so long it should be celebrated even more.  Great food, wonderful atmosphere.  Needless to say, I'm a fan.  Tourists and residents alike have kept it going for decades."}
{"text":"Two hugely contrasting experiences in here as far as food's concerned.

First time I went there was more cheese than base and crust, with only the great cheap beer making up for it.

Second time I went here the pizza was flawless and among the best I've had in Toronto.

It also has a kick ass patio!"}

Caf√© Diplomatico continues to deliver their excellent service and their always delicious food into 2017!

It is always such a pleasure to dine at Caf√© Diplomatico and tonight was another example
 of a fantastic dining experience.  We are very lucky to have such an incredible restaurant to dine with. They make every one feel like family!"}
{"text":"Well we were in Little Italy looking for a nice patio and a place to grab a beer. We found this place and the servers were nice but the service was slow. We did not order any food so I cannot comment on that. Would I go back, no.  Did the food look good? No.  The beer selection.... Leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"A friend and I were walking along college street looking for an outdoor patio to eat dinner at since the weather was so warm. We arrived here at 6pm on a Wednesday and were greeted by two waitresses at the front of the restaurant and then proceeded to seat ourselves outside. Moments later, menus arrived along with our water. 
Our waitress was super friendly but unfortunately was also really busy and wasn't able to take our order for quite some time. When we were finally able to get her attention, my friend and I ordered the mini arancinis ($6/5pcs) from the appetizer section which we split. It was crispy on the outside, still steaming, filled with tomato and cheese and we dipped that in a warm tomato sauce which I later finished off with their complimentary bread rolls. Again, quite some time had passed until we were able to put in our order for the main course, but when we did the food took really long to come out as well. I ordered the meat lasagna ($15) and my friend had the daily special - chicken parm with pasta or salad ($11). The cheese was perfectly melted and browned and the sauce had a really nice flavour but the lasagna noodle itself was mushy and the whole dish seemed to lack height and texture. Our water was never refilled but we were able to ration it till the end if our meal haha... which lasted almost 2 hours.

Overall, the food was decent and filling but I feel like this would be a better place to share a couple of drinks or just hang out at if time is not an issue. Will probably be back when the weather is consistently warm for drinks by the patio and maybe a pizza because our neighbouring tables had some really delicious looking ones!"}
{"text":"Packed patio.

All hype.

Food isn't awesome.

Nice to sit out there as long as there aren't too many smokers."}
{"text":"I am surprized this place is not rated higher, we had a great veal sandwich there. (way better than the highly touted and dry Mustachio's)
It was nice and tender with a tasty tomato sauce. We also had the Tuesday special for lunch which is grilled veal. Not as tender as the sandwich but mighty tasty. The service was very friendly and the canoli rocked. True, it was a little wetter than I prefer but the shell was perfect and the filling tasty.  This is not a place you go for l a ife changing experience, but for   traditional Italian, hold the attitude, fare.

{"text":"I went there to see a friend of mine on Saturday around noon time. It was very crowded and packed. This place seems to be very popular and it is always crowded. Staff were nice and customers were nice. It was a noisy and lively place. However, this was not the place I could meet friends to talk about something personal or serious. It will be very casual environment not intimate and cozy place. This was the place to watch people and feel relaxed among people. Food and beverage were not one of the best, but not the worst either. The same thing about staff. Staff were not the most pleasant but not the worst either. They always had customers among nice cafes and restaurants, so they must have good business."}
{"text":"Although I normally don't read other reviews just before I write them, I took a glance through some and am going to run with it.  I went here with a friend on a Friday evening, well night, and although it was cool, the heat lamps were on so we decided to sit outside.  Maybe it was because we were eating late-ish, but we were seated right away (we could've sit inside as well).  I ended up getting the pizza, which was shared, and the house Brindisi wine, plus a dessert and espresso.  The wine was what I would consider \"typical\" house wine, but I did not like the pizza.  It certainly wasn't inedible, but I wouldn't go back for it and I certainly wouldn't recommend it.  However, I obviously enjoyed it enough to believe that their dessert must be good.  The dessert was good and so was the espresso.  There, I've found some positives.  Go here for dessert and coffee to say that you've \"been\", if that is what you're after."}
{"text":"Nothing in this place is particularly impressive. We've all had cheese and bread before. Its popular among people who know little else around the area. The service is usually bad because they seem to think they are local legends. You can get Italian food in a dozen other places on college street. Might as well explore a little. The sushi on College is way better and the service is immaculate."}
{"text":"Great place to sit back and have a cold beer.
and watch life go by college street."}
{"text":"Just when I thought I knew what horrid service was....this place pulled a one up me. 

After a nice stroll me & my main decide to try this place out - the patio looks pretty chill and it was def popular. 

I cannot begin to explain how poor the quality of food was. The oil/bread app they give you was just...blah. The oil had a thick body and they seriously should consider adding vinaigrette. 

Our server was \"new\" with a heavy English accent so I suppose this should have been the first indicator. Still, we aren't such demanding folk so why not give it a whirl? Wrong. After she forgot to bring us the starter, we had to remind her about the drinks- thrice. How complicated is water and coke? 
We had to wave down another server and finally he got us our drinks. I will say this tho, the coke class has a PUMA symbol on it. I have no clue what that's about but I like it. I wanted to try and take it home. Rest assured, I didn't. Too many witnesses. 

I noticed that there's alot of groups that come here for the beer/pasta/snacks patio. With the way the servers are (they take 45minutes to come check on you), it's pretty good if you are looking to not be disturbed. If you are looking for food - keep walking and come back to the patio for a beer. 

Order: 
Crab dip 
\"special\" - which we had to get another 2 servers to find out because our server and I quote ' haven't a bloody clue' - OH, brother. 
grilled chicken panini - I got the panini without the chicken - HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN? the server tried to tell me I ordered it that way. After huffing and puffing about how she will 'see what she can do' , I just sat there in shock. A- I am starving! B - what a RUDE way to make me feel. Actually, what a rude way to make ANYONE feel. 
wow. 

The bathroom is pure sketch. You walk inside and walk all the way to the end, down the smallest/sketchiest looking series of steps,you'll face the back/kitchen door. Walk down another bunch of steps down to the basement which is just a horror show. They DREW the \"ladies\" bathroom sign. REALLY? REALLY? considering you can get a sign from the dollar store, there is NO excuse. One of the doors to the 3 stalls wont even close properly. 

We paid and left as soon as we got the bill - which on it's own was mission impossible. 
Ughh.

{"text":"Great patio spot with excellent pizza and open late! This is best when the (heated) patio is open, so haven't been there during the winter. The service is quick and good. It's not a fancy or try to be kind of place, but the food is excellent for the price and the drinks too! 

If you like to build your own pizza with a huge selection of toppings, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"I went there with a group of friends for lunch, as there weren't a lot of restaurants open on College during the week for lunch time. I knew from past experiences this place had a great patio but terrible food but that was years ago so we decided to give it try again to see if things had improved. Well... its actually worse. I ordered Linguine Vongole, which is a dish I usually order at any Italian restaurant in the city. It tasted and smelled awful.  The clams came out of a can! At all the other restaurants, the clams are still in the shell so you know they are fresh, but these ones were mushy and certainly the canned typed. I will never order anything but beer there again."}
{"text":"I used to live a few blocks away from Cafe Diplomatico. It is an institution in Little Italy, where trendy restaurants, pubs, delis, cafes, boutiques and clubs create a European feel. This place is huge and it's got a lively patio on hot summer nights. The food is authentic Italian comfort food, so if you're in the mood for a home-cooked plate of pasta or panzerotti, Cafe D's a sure bet. The smell of fresh bread emanates from this place that feels like a cross between a diner and pizzeria. 

Parking's a little tight in the area, as it is in most downtown neighbourhoods, so it's best to take the subway and street car over to College. Go early to get a spot on the patio. Then linger for drinks and people watching. You'll be the envy of the late-comers, who won't be so lucky."}
{"text":"This has got to be the most amazing spot in Toronto to go to for breakfast. I've personally been going to cafe dip with my boyfriend for 5 days in a row now because there's literally no where that can top their amazing menu or pricing. It's super affordable, the staff are amazing and friendlier than most cafes and it really makes you want to keep on going back for more the next day. 6 dollars for breakfast before 11!!!! Check out this place and give Lina a huge tip for being so awesome! :D"}
{"text":"We only stopped in for coffee and dessert. When we told the waiter we didn't need bread, as we were just there for after dinner treats, he looked annoyed. Yes, I get it. Your tip might suck. But we're still customers, right?

The chocolate cake was pretty damn good. The frosting was a bit too thin, but the cake was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The \"Sicilian Crepe\" was unimpressive. A crepe wrapped around vanilla ice cream, and drizzled with chocolate. Ok, but not spectacular. Not that it promises to be.

Coffee was excellent, and, excluding the wait staff, I liked the atmosphere. Lots of people sitting outdoors, looking relaxed, deep in conversation. Very mellow crowd."}
{"text":"Updated: Went there again a few times and realized that food is a hit or miss and service can be patchy at times. A decent option if you're in the area, but won't recommend you to drive there to eat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We love Cafe Diplomatico. We've been there a few times. The service has always been great and so is their pizza. 

Pizza - Thin crust. Decent amount of cheese and toppings. Well done but never burnt. If you're looking for NY style or Chicago style pizza this place is not for you.
Pasta - It is usually done well, not overcooked like at many other places. The sauce however depends on your liking. Some people find it bland some okay. The quantity is huge.
Mains - We like their whole grilled Rainbow Trout. It comes with Pasta or Salad. Good sized portion. 
Coffee - is meh. We expected more as its a famous cafe.

Didn't try the desserts as we usually either have churros at Pancho's or Tiramisu/Canoli at Riviera bakery or Ice cream at Sicilian Ice creams after."}
{"text":"The thin bacon is very tasty but the tator tots are revolting. 

They do not have freshly squeezed OJ. 

I think I kinda hate this place."}
{"text":"I went there today with my wife.  She had a great fettuccine with tomato sauce the last time she went, so she was very enthusiastic about bringing me here.  

Service was very whatever.  Nothing outstanding.  I don't want to say the service was bad, as the server was friendly.. but the table we sat at wasn't wiped down, they didn't offer us water, and for some reason every other table got bread but ours didn't.  Our cutlery and plates were also visibly dirty (not just water stains, but left over red gunk on our plates).  No harm, no foul.

My wife had the fettuccine with bolognese sauce.  The fettuccine was way over cooked and bolognese sauce was pretty bland.  Keep in mind too, she was really looking forward to this, so it was a massive disappointment for her.

I had the fried panzerotti, with just cheese and pepperoni.  It was alright.  It's hard to mess up fried bread with cheese and pepperoni.

At the end of the day, Cafe Diplomatico is the kind of place that will stay in business solely due to it's location and the heavy foot traffic.  Food was decent enough, service was mediocre, and the atmosphere wasn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"While on vacation we went to Toronto with the family. My dad is Italian so when we found out there was a little Italy he was ecstatic. I wanted to surprise him with a visit to little Italy for lunch so we took the subway and the street cars over to check it out. This is not a New York City type of little Italy. We were recommended this restaurant by a couple who owns a record store down the street who were real Italians so we decided to give it a try. 

The service was excellent. The waiters were constantly Checking on us and even the manager and his wife came to our table a couple of times to help clean up and make sure everything is alright. The table ordered the eggplant parmigiana, chicken parmigiana, and 2 make your own pastas.  The food was just ok. We didn't think it was anything spectacular. Felt the tomato sauce was a little sour. We always go to little Italy in New York so we expecting that type of food and area. But overall it was a decent restaurant. Was just expecting more authentic cuisine."}
{"text":"My friend is a regular and chose this place for her birthday dinner. She really wanted to sit on the patio, but they couldn't accommodate our group of 8, so my friend was pretty disappointed. The menu mostly consists of pastas and pizzas. I had the pasta with tomato sauce and seafood. Portions are huge, and they were super generous with the seafood. That being said, there was nothing at all special about my dish. I think this was the most mediocre pasta I've ever had at an Italian restaurant. It wasn't bad but the sauce was pretty bland and the whole thing lacked anything special.  My friends did enjoy their pizzas though, so hopefully their pizzas are much better. Service was super friendly and helpful though!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing, my family and I are the type of people to try any restaurant that's just around the corner because we're lazy. And rarely is it actually a place that we like. We were visiting Toronto from San Francisco, CA and were in the mood for Italian so we just parked across the street and walked in.

The service, atmosphere was nice from the start. But when the food got there... WOW! Their pasta was AMAZING!!! I forgot what I ordered and I wish I remembered so I could tell you all but my family and I have not stopped talking about that restaurant since we've visited over 5 years ago.

Everytime we head to an Italian restaurant back home, we always compare it and say \"remember that one italian restaurant in toronto!! That was soo goood!\" My sister agrees. I definitely rate it 5 stars for service, atmosphere and delicious food!

The manager even gave us free dessert, on the house! :)"}
{"text":"This place has been there forever, with good reason; it's great. The food is always top notch and so is the service. They are very helpful when it comes to the menu : dealing with food allergies , diabetes, etc..
I suggest the trout , which comes with fresh salad. The ribeye steak is amazing and any thing Italian.
Reasonably priced ! A fully stocked bar with excellent half priced  
GIVE IT A TRY.. 
I recommend this place.  
                                           ."}
{"text":"Coffee was fantastic. Pizza is good! Pastas are huge portions and very good! Sangria is fantastic!!!! :) prices are good! Very friendly and fantastic staff!"}
{"text":"What makes this place so good is that it is anything but good and everyone seems to accept it for what it is and enjoy themselves..  The food is anything but perfect or what you might expect but and the service is just OK. I believe people come here for all those reasons, poor service and just OK food and best of all no attitude.  Like coming home and not having to worry about what you are wearing because you are home and it is more about the people. Relaxed and sometimes a great party attitude. Good luck getting a seat on a hot summers eve."}
{"text":"Only been for breakfast a few times, but totally a new a staple in my life. Breakfast is good and simple. Not to mention extremely affordable. Less than 10 bucks gets you a decent meal. The patio is lovely and the staff are sweet and personable. One thing to note is, as lovely as the staff are, they are a little disorganized so don't come here if you're planning to get in and our fast."}
{"text":"I'll just get right to it. By far the worst $17 veggie Burger I have ever had. It came with no fries or sides whatsoever, but at $17 for what is also a very small burger, a side of any sort would have been atleast a decent thing to include.
As if that was not disappointing enough, I opened the burger to find the thickest cross-section slice of an onion... Not one or two onion rings but the entire cross-section of an onion (I've attached a pic)... I was horrified... Complete trash.
As if it couldn't get worse, I look in the bag for ketchup, but it was in vain, no ketchup in sight.... but hey, why would I need ketchup? Not like I have fries or anything to eat...just a dry Onion Burger.

Also, a \"side\" of Avocado was $2.50 for 4 slices, just no comment at this point 

Never again....next time i'll just throw my $17 out the window!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple of days ago to watch the Germany game with 3 friends and it was packed! Luckily we got a table as soon as we got there and were very happy. It took a long time for someone to take our drink order and then much longer to take our food order - maybe because of how busy the place was, but it was way too long. 

It also took some time to have our good prepared and we didn't actually start eating until after the game. When the food arrived it wasn't really that good (the gnocchi). 

Positives: Germany won, the fries were amazing! And the beer is a good price!"}
{"text":"Came here for a veal sandwich with a friend who works close by. He's got the gluten death so has to have fries and an Italian sausage. No gluten free options here! Not a bad veal sandwich but they chare for coffee refills! I'd Like to try some of the pasta or the specials before I give this College street institution a more permanent review. Think of this as provisional."}
{"text":"Can't say too much as we just came here for a drink prior to our dinner reservation. It was filling up fast and I have heard their gnocchi is great. I would definitely return for that. They made me the best Baileys with milk combo I've ever had and warmed up some Brandy for my date who was sick. Very prompt service and a nice casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would recommend this spot for a quick breakfast or nice cappacinos to enjoy on their great patio on a sunny day. They have daily specials that are great pricing and have always had friendly service. The location is very convenient and accessible by streetcar or a short walk (5-10 mins depending how fast of a walker you are)from queens park subway."}
{"text":"Being from out of town, I wanted a good experience so I took a risk and bought a restaurant.com coupon. It was super convenient location-wise. Plus, the decor was cute for the winter-time. Quaint, but not your fanciest restaurant so DON'T expect that romantic setting. Then again, with that you don't get the extra cost of the fancy dishes and napkins which leaves you with a full belly, tasty beer/wine, and a great night!

Decent selection of craft beer too for me! That's a beautiful thing, to me. 

Attentive service. It was so individualized and entertaining! I would come here again for the home-y service. I can't wait to see this during the summer time too."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon deal for this place and I still feel like I've been robbed. Don't get me wrong, I know this place and love the patio in the summer, so I know better to expect a 5 start  meal, but I did expect better than what we received...the food was just so bad. The buns tasted like spongy cardboard bread that was kept in the fridge for 5 weeks. The risotto balls were still cold in the middle and the chicken parm was burnt to a crisp. The desserts were also half frozen and even the espresso was burnt. 
The pizza at the table over looked pretty good but I doubt I'll go back (sober) to find out."}
{"text":"Typical breakfast diner. The only noteworthy thing is their coffee - reunion island coffee - my friend seemed to like it a lot and claims it to be \"the best coffee within a five-mile radius\". One thing to note is that Canadian breakfast sandwiches comes with regular toast, not a english muffin, croissant, or biscuit, which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 large pizzas, which were a little undercooked on the bottom, but not a deal breaker.  I like the concept of customizing your pizza per topping,  but $1.50 for a couple sprinkles of feta?  Really?

My friend's chicken sandwich was dry and underwhelming.  We did manage to redeem it somewhat by ordering extra mayo (we got a dirty look for that) and mixing it with hot sauce and then slathering the chicken all over.

Fusilli special was very tasty, good portion with a creamy rich rose sauce (could've used a bit more butter though).  However, the garlic bread was sad, dry and boring.

All in all, I enjoyed the atmosphere, an unpretentious place for decent pizza and a couple drinks."}
{"text":"I have to agree that this is one of the BEST places to look at people. The location is ideal. One of my favourite places in Toronto"}
{"text":"Went there today with family. It was busy with the festival. Ordered the basics. Spicy mussels and pizza and a beer. Decent average food for a lunch visit. Unfortunately my beer order didn't arrive. About halfway through the meal I asked if the beer was coming. Waitress looked like she didn't remember and had to ask again what I had ordered and said she'd get it. Meal almost now over and decided not to keep asking for the beer. Bill came and of course she had put the beer on the tab. I had to wait again to flag her down and get it corrected. She apologized. But too late. I won't be back. Used to come at least a few times per summer. Will take my $ elsewhere in the future. Seems like they are getting too busy/popular to give at least the basic service correctly."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and the staff was extremely pleasant.   Food was pretty good.  Definitely would recommend it."}
{"text":"Again, this place is ok. However, for what it offers I think their prices are too high. The quality of the food is like the microwavable boxes. Again, it must be the patio that keeps this place around."}
{"text":"I like the patio here, and the pizza is pretty good.  I haven't ordered much here, I mostly come for drinks on the patio.

I have had the spicy mussles which were really good,  White wine, onions and jalapenos. Not too spicy but good flavour.  I'd order them again. 

The house wine Sangiovese was nice and light to go with our sharezies. The pasta dishes coming out of the kitchen looked OK.  I am a stickler for pasta and don't think I'd order it from here. I've seen better dishes elsewhere.  It's not an expensive place, and the service is relateively good here so I will continue to come back for drinks and mussles on the patio.

I ordered a margarhita pizza, it was basically a cheese pizza with some chopped basil and garlic on top... but the crust was really nice and I enjoyed it nonetheless."}
{"text":"Staff here are my favourite people! 

Very nice and helpful staff - the margaritas are very good, and the tiramisu is pretty BOMB. The cannoli was too sweet for me cause the filling is fairly thick, but my friend was happy to have the whole thing. The patio is the place to be. Very lovely and lively! 

Great for couples, families and friends!"}
{"text":"After sitting on the patio for over 10 minutes waiting to be greeted, I was not happy. Nevertheless, I had a glance at the menu and I was less than impressed. They are trying to do everything here - pizza, pasta, meat, salad, appetizers.....too much stuff, none of which looked that great. 

The greatest disappointment is the selection of beer - bud, bud light, molson, coors, etc. Some thinking outside the box would go a long way in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"It was my first time today in diplomatico, and it was a perfect experience. Very nice and friendly service, clean place, good prices and excellent food. In fact, I don't remember having better meatball sandwich in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Cafe Diplomatico is a place where you can go with a group of friends, have a beer, chat, eat average Italian style food, and not be over charged, while in the heart of Little Italy.

Whenever the Euro / World Cup is happening, this is a place you might want to visit with a group of friends and take in the craziness of soccer madness.

Its a nice place to relax at.

Oh, what did i eat?  I think i had the calamari, and a beer, and our table shared a pizza.  Nothing outstanding, but nothing horrible.  The fact that i remember more about our table conversation about the pro's and cons of neighborhoods in Toronto speaks volumes..  Its comforting to know that sometimes a restaurant doesn't need to present amazing dishes / a culinary experience... it just needs to give fast friendly service, and decent food."}
{"text":"Will not be ordering from here again, I had a meal that was worse than high school cafeteria food. I tried the BLT, a grilled cheese and calamari - each worse than the last. 

The sandwiches are made with wonder bread and both were soggy. The BLT had one sad slice of processed Kraft cheese, which could have at the very least been melted. The grilled cheese, tasted neither grilled nor cheesy. Bread was soggy and the cheese tasted like plastic.

The calamari, in keeping with the theme, was soggy and flavourless. 

The one saving grace was the tiramisu which was moist and light.

All in all a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"As someone who eats gluten free and lived in Italy for 2 years, I can say that their gluten free pizza is amazing. Their. At and staff bring back wonderful memories of lunches in Milano. It just feels like a second home."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday and loved it. They had 5 Amsterdam beers in an ice bucket for $24 during the world cup, and they have some great pizza too. Cool patio with a big screen for the game. Definitely worth going to again."}
{"text":"The Dip spot aka best spot for cheap beers aka Toronto's most underrated patio aka great spot to catch sports on a big screen. What can I say - great beer, pizza, & atmosphere, a must visit if you're in the city"}
{"text":"The Dip!
Its all about watching people, having a beer on the patio and enjoying the summer's warmth.
The Cafe Diplimatico is somewhat of a renaissance cafe situated in the heart of Little Italy. Its all about comfort Italian food, fresh baked pasta, and great thin crust Pizza. The service is exceptional, and the entire staff is as good as the food.
This is the place in the summer to relax on the patio, watch the beautiful people walk by, and enjoy the comforts of Little Italy."}
{"text":"This place has been in business long enough to know how to make everything just good enough that you won't complain.

Today's breakfast was a good example of that. It's $5.29 or $6.29 depending on if you order before 11am or not. Today it was composed of 2 scrambled eggs which were actually scrambled well, but then on the side 2 (instead of the customary 3) pieces of deep fried sausage, around a half dozen tater tots, and toast which somehow managed to be burnt on the top but only toasted enough to be considered bread still for the other 3/4s of its density. And my dining partner had similar results only their eggs were over easy and came out near cold temperature.

And I could have sworn it said coffee was included but we were charged. But again, not enough of a hassle to want to complain to question it. Just paid the bill and bounced."}
{"text":"Came here after paintlounge. Cute little diner.

Had salad with grilled calamari. The house beer is a-ok."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday afternoon around 7pm and the restaurant was pretty busy both inside and on their patio. We were immediately seated as we have already reserved a table for 7 people. 

Their menu is a little overpriced. For the pasta, you have to choose the pasta, which was $12 and you have to add extra when you choose the sauce/way of cooking ($1-$2). I got the Penne Alfredo and the food was not worth the price I paid. It was bland and I had to add salt, pepper and cheese (pro: they provide cheese powder without additional cost). In summary, their food is mediocre and overpriced. Maybe I should try their pizza next time. The woman who seemed to be a manager or supervisor was a little rude when serving us, but the servers there provided a good service. 

Service: 3.5/5
Food: 3/5
Price: 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Late night eating is one of my most favourite past times. So Cafe Diplamatico is great.

It was about 11pm on a Tuesday night, everyone else's meals where ending up and we came in to get that staff look of \"umm okay, take a seat -______-\"

Fair enough.

We ordered the Chicken Parmigiana with a side of pasta, and the Mussels with Cheesy Garlic Bread (we were here to eat). 

The Mussels were not of the best quality, and improperly cleaned shells, however the sauce was good, although sparing. Why can you not find mussels swimming in a pool of sauce? Seriously. But back to the sauce, it was a great compliment to dip my cheesy garlic bread in.

The parm was standard, nothing of note but hit that pig out and roll home style of eating. Don't judge me, but hollowing out a dinner roll, stuffing it with pasta and then dipping it into mussel sauce was delicious..."}
{"text":"Just lunch at Cafe Diplomatico. The patio is great, spacious seating between tables 
But that's about the positive review. The service  and the food are both very average. Nothing special at all. We paid too much money for really very average food. 
I would not come back for the food but maybe for a beer."}
{"text":"Caf√© Diplomatico is a Toronto staple.  Back when my sister used to live in this neighbourhood (and street car stops were announced by living people instead of sexy computer voices) the street car driver would call out this stop as \"Caf√© Diplomatico\" instead of the actual street name (\"Clinton St.\")

The Dip celebrated its 40th anniversary this year, and it's not hard to see why.  Their food is delicious.  I've enjoyed their veal sandwiches, their bacon and egg breakfasts, and most importantly their pizza.  Oh my goodness their pizza.

Now granted, this is no Chicago deep dish pizza (very jealous of Chicago about this) but as far as Pizza in Toronto goes?  Delicious.  It's just the fact that it tastes like what I imagine pizza is supposed to taste like.  It's the opposite of the processed cheese of pizza.  It feels like its made with love.

Unfortunately, their popularity has interfered with me enjoying some pizza, veal, coffee or whatever many times.  To get a seat you either have to be prepared to wait in line, or you have to be lucky.  There's really no two ways about it."}
{"text":"This was very average. I agree with the ratings, the food came very slow. We ordered chicken parmigiano and took 30 mind. We ordered ceasers as well and they didn't come with any garnish! Like none. Definitely not coming back"}
{"text":"For eat-in and take-out \"The Dip\" has great big pizzas with lots of oozing cheesy goodness."}
{"text":"This place's exterior will catch your eye and make you feel like they have the most authentic Italian dishes ever made. Not too mention their Patio that seems to fill up during the summer. However, low and behold people do not be fooled! I came here and will never ever ever in my life return. Me and my sister both ordered two panzerottis and what came on a plate was a Panzerotti gushing in half a litre of Oil. We took three bites and could not even fathom finishing the rest of it. Our server came back to us and even asked us if we wanted to take it home and we declined. He didn't care to ask why 90% of it was still left on the plate!

This place is a no-no. If you want Italian Food keep it moving down college street and you will find places a lot more decent than here. 

In the words of an Italian Nonna \"Non Buono!\""}
{"text":"we ordered seafood here and drank some yum beer. if i say \"yum\" to beer, then it must be good because i hate beer. i forgot what it was called, but it was mixed with some other alcohol. 

the ambiance is awesome, and when we were there, the patrons were quite friendly. i would go back here whenever i come back to toronto."}
{"text":"As an Italian restaurant expert, I can tell you that Cafe Diplomatico is amazing! It has great food, cheap prices and it is in a great location.

In the heart of Toronto's Little Italy (College Street), \"The Dip\" offers up a huge variety of the 3 P's... PIZZAS, PASTAS and PANINIS!

They offer an amazing build your own pizza and pasta options.

For pizza, you get choice of sauce, crust, cheeses and toppings and has reasonable pricing per topping you want on your personalized pizza.

For pasta, they offer a choice of both plain pasta and meat and cheese filled pastas, along with your choice of meat, rose, marinara, alfredo sauce, etc!

In the summer time, they opened up their huge and busy patio, which is always a hotspot for an after-work drink, meal or a night out. 

To celebrate the upcoming warm weather, The Dip's tables with be packed with their yummy strawberry daquiris and other frozen alcohol favourites.

Another important point... Cafe Diplomatico gives you delicious food at a very cheap price!"}
{"text":"It's extremely tough to get a server's attention. We sat, were given menus, and then had to wait 12 minutes before a drink order was taken. Make no mistake, after the first 5 minutes we tried to flag down ANYONE who would serve us, including the person behind the counter (who told us our server would be right with us....7 minutes later). The place was DEAD. The food here is bland. I don't know what part of Italy they are trying to represent here because as a full blooded Italian myself, i have never tasted anything this bad. Garlic fixes most things. I barely tasted garlic. The meatballs taste like they are made with sawdust. The sauce is watery, almost like they opened a jar of pasata and added NOTHING TO IT. 

My recommendation? Keep walking...don't bother"}
{"text":"Great spot to watch the World Cup game.  The breakfast/brunch was good.  Typical breakfast, eggs/bacon/etc.. Service was friendly, good selection of beer, nice patio, televisions all around you... World Cup atmosphere."}
{"text":"The patio of this place is absolutely bonkers during the summer, but I don't really understand why. College and Clinton is a nice little corner so I guess people don't mind waiting in line for a table in order to drink and people watch. As far as having dinner though? There are so many better options in the area than The Dip.

I hadn't been here in a long time and thought I would give it a shot, but was greatly disappointed. The service was nice enough so I will give props to our waiter, but the food was incredibly bland and not exactly cheap for borderline cafeteria food. It was early afternoon and I was still in coffee mode, but was surprised that refills were 50 cents each. Who charges for refills anymore?!

I also had lentil soup, which lacked any flavour whatsoever, and a sandwich I believe was called the Diplomatico: if this is their signature sandwich than I don't think I'd care to try the others. It was incredibly skimpy on ingredients and was one of those instances where you're eating more bread than anything else. Gross.

Likely won't be coming back here again to be honest. Unless someone really wants to go, but past experiences haven't been too exciting and Utopia is right next door."}
{"text":"Casual dining, staff are nice and made my request for an expression martini :) I just like more of an ambiance"}
{"text":"I totally agree with Avi, ditto to everything he already mentioned. I'm from New York and know something about pizza and it was simply delicious with onions and mushrooms. I've been to Italy and the cafe decor there is also simple and unpretentious. The Caesar salad was plentiful and tasty. Price is right and service was fine. I recommend this place highly!"}
{"text":"was not good as I remembered it to be. the fish use to be the best thing but they changed it and not for the better. will not be returning to this restaurant ."}
{"text":"This place is a solid three stars across the board, and gets the bump for two things: the friendly (though not necessarily speedy) service, and the Mama's Chicken Sandwich.

Essentially Cafe Dip is a standard Italian cafe, with big screen for soccer, and expresso makers behind the bar, in need of a decorative overhaul.

It is a \"go-to\" place in the neighborhood for its service, atmosphere, patio (in season), and prices.

We had brunch for $23 for two, including tip.

Asked for a recommendation and the server didn't hesitate and suggested the Mama's Chicken.  Hand breaded and pan fried, adorned with onions, hot peppers, mozzarella and Pomodoro sauce.  On a fresh baked Portugese roll. Yes, I ate this for brunch.  Don't judge.  I was hungry.

The crowd is diverse, from young families to old timer Nonnos.  Check it out."}
{"text":"The Dip isn't going to blow your mind, as far as Italian food goes - but what it does offer is friendly and fast service, tasty food, and a certain je ne sais quoi that just makes it feel really comfortable as a place to go get a meal. They also have amazing cannoli for after your feed.

Daily specials are usually worth a look. And I seem to always forget when I go that their arrabbiata sauce is really, really hot - the whole jalapeno pepper chopped up in it should be a clue."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with Cafe Dip. It looks like it should be some sort of age old college institution. But it ain't!

Instead, it's a fairly dirty restaurant with mediocre food and no spectacular deals. I found the menu to be seriously blah. 

Bottom Line: If you are on college street, there are much better places you can go to get better eats at similar prices."}
{"text":"Brad and I came here for brunch twice while on our Toronto trip. We liked it that much!

Saturday, we both ordered the Yukattack. It was so much food! I loved how different it was and tastey!

Sunday, Brad got the Yuckattack again and I just got the french toast. Again, very good!

I thought the service was good too. And on Sunday, it seemed like this was the only place open at 9 AM."}
{"text":"The patio was fine but nothing special. The food was mediocre and expensive. Our server was nice but it took her 15 mins to come to our table with menus and water. I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Bleh - we were desperate for some post-dinner dessert and the nearby ice cream shop was closing up.

I've always walked by Diplomatico and could tell the place sucked.  Just look at that huge patio on Little Italy --and the clientele.  It didn't shout 'quality'... more like 'why are we so lazy and we ended up at this last resort?'.

Anyways - the cannoli was tough and the creme brulee top was chewy.  Ugh.

I can understand the appeal -- quasi-Italian in a diner setting in middle of Little Italy.  Definitely looks like a prime patio spot -- but pass on this one if you looking for edible food."}
{"text":"The Bolognese was pretty good the Arrabbiata not so much...I really liked the atmosphere. Very nice casual and friendly.

At 12 bucks a plate of pasta it is not all that cheap"}
{"text":"This would get two stars if not for the location. The food here is average and over-priced. Haven't tried the sangria yet which would be the only reason I'd return."}
{"text":"We went there for Sunday night dinner. The place was bit empty but to our surprise the food was delicious. 
Our serevers name was Farabi. The first time I understood that how are important the service is is to your overall dining experience. This guy was awesome. Food was great but the service was even better. 
Will definetly come back here someday."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for some drinks.  The outdoor patio was nice.  The waiter was friendly and prompt. We ordered a pitcher of sangria for $35.  The amount of alcohol they put in the sangria was a lot, as the drink tasted strong.  It was also sweeter compared to other places.  I didn't like the fact that they added frozen fruits (the frozen fruits packet you find in the supermarket to make smoothies).  Overall, it was a good experience and I would consider coming back."}
{"text":"Came here on a beautiful Saturday around noon and the patio and everything was PACKED! That being said, we managed to get a seat quite quickly and ordered a pitcher of sangria (pretty good all things considered, and for the price), and a burger and a club sandwich and fries. The food was all freshly prepared (especially the fries which were piping hot and perfectly cooked), but it definitely wasn't from scratch. We also got bread to the table which was an unexpected touch that made me smile. 

Looking around, lots of people had ordered pizzas that looked fresh and delicious, so I will definitely be back to try the pizza! Even if it weren't for the pizza, this place is a definite win, in the summer, for the patio!"}
{"text":"I go there every weekend.
I Love getting everyone I know here. 
There is no better service anywhere else.
Try their pizzas, ice creams, tea and coffee"}
{"text":"Not much luck with restaurants lately. Has not been here in a very long time, decided to go down to College street for a nice evening out. Made a reservation (only for the inside, can't reserve for the patio), good think because the patio was packed and there was a long wait. Most of the food was very disappointing. Ordered bruschetta...waiter did not ask if we wanted cheese on it (it is extra) and it was ok. Ordered the meatball appetizer to share, it came freezing cold to the table. My veal scaloppine was nothing special and cold and my daughter's ravioli was equally cold. The pizza that two people had got good reviews. The salad my wife ordered for a meal was barely an appetizer size. Good thing there are a ton of other restaurants on College, Cafe Dip won't be on our list for the next time."}
{"text":"Was walking by went in and had lunch, the food was amazing I would recommend it to anyone looking to have a great Italian meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the staff is always very friendly. The service is quick and the food has always been good! I've had the chicken parmaseana twice with pasta and it was amazing, definitely my favourite dish from there. They have a wide menu including some sea food, pizza, pasta, italian entrees etc. I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great - there's a reason it's an institution.  Although not much of the menu is going to change your life, it's reliable, friendly, inexpensive, and a great atmosphere.  I will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst service experiences I have ever had. The staff were cursing, yelling and seemed notably upset. Our waitress left the table midway through taking our order frustrated that we had questions about the menu. Another waitress made the people next to us move tables twice. 

It seemed they forgot to come and take our orders - we eventually had to flag them down to order. They didn't have the first two beers listed on their menu that we wanted to order.

One of our meals didn't arrive. It took 10 minutes to track down the server to tell her. At that point there was no apology. The food was brought out just in time to be packed up and we were still charged for it. This entire process took HOURS.

The patio looks nice, but don't be tempted."}
{"text":"I really want to write an excellent review because this place has been around for 50 years and it is good....most of the time! Pizzas and pastas are prepared well and taste good.  Casual nothing fancy, bring your kids, nice patio. Good vibes. This time however....I ordered the carpaccio. I don't know who the head chef is but they're not Italian or they don't know what carpaccio is or both. What I got was Bresaola  which is a smoked salted beef. Not carpaccio.  Who's in charge in the kitchen? Hey chef! don't you know that? 5 slices for $14. Then I ordered the Aglio, Olio e Peperoncino. I had to pay an extra $1 for this dish. I got chunks of raw garlic slices, no red pepper flakes and a whole bunch of oil. I sent it back because anyone who cooks or eats garlic knows served like that it's difficult to digest and causes stomach upset.  I asked them to fully cook the garlic until brown on both sides. Who's the head chef in there? Why doesn't the kitchen know how to make one of the most basic dishes? Why to I need to tell them? IS there a manager/owner that does quality control? seems like basic stuff to know.....I got a replacement that was passable but again they seemed to forget the pepperoncino. 
We made the most of it. I ordered another Moretti :)
Service was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Meh.  This could easily have been a 1*, but the service pulled it out of the total trash.

So, good service and bad food.   The house red wine was not bad, but not worth remembering either.   The best part of the meal was the balsamic vinegar that arrived with the buns and oil.  Buns? yeah, not so appropriate, but they were edible. 

The mixed appie platter turned out to be onions deep-fried two ways, cheese deep-fried two ways and egg rolls.   Three food industry dip things, plus two that might have been house-made or scooped from a vat.   Yuck.   Uniformly over-cooked and hard appies.  Nasty. 

On to the mains.   I had the veal sandwich.   Over-breaded/over-cooked.   The veal was probably decent before it was delivered here.   A cold schmear of blah tomato sauce on the bun.    The hot dog I had earlier in the day at Costco was fresher and  hotter and had better flavour.   My table mate had chicken in a white sauce on pasta.   She ate about 1/2 as she was ravenous.  Nothing positive to say about the flavour. 

ok.  dessert.   I think they can't mess up a Sicilian crepe.   I am wrong.   My friend orders black forest cake (at an Italian resto? ok, they're not doing well with the Italian dishes, might as well try something else.)   It arrives looking like someone had stuck their thumb through it, tunneling for gold.   Not so tasty. 

$100 for this nastiness.   We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Comfort food. Doesn't feel like it belongs on College St. amidst the array of hip and trendy restaurants and stores that line the street. This space could really be used for something better.

I had the Salmon burger, and it was okay. I could have had a better frozen burger. Service is pretty good. They don't accept debit."}
{"text":"I had supper tonight at Caf√© Diplomatico.  I've been there a couple times over the years.  It was nice to sit on the heated patio.

I ordered a personal pizza with pepperoni, bacon and sliced tomatoes.  I love love love pizza and this was a good pizza.

Service was a bit slow.  I suspect there wasn't enough staff.  Though the servers were friendly, it took 20 minutes for anyone to notice I needed a refill on my drink and it took a while to get to pay."}
{"text":"I always go to Cafe Diplomatico when I'm in Toronto. I love pasta and this is my absolute favourite place. I go here for my birthday every year for family dinner. I love the pasta. My favourite is the penne a la vodka with sausage and mushrooms. I also love the seafood linguini. The prices are amazing, much better than you could get in Brampton and the food is ALWAYS delicious. 
My sister loves the sea bass and my boyfriend enjoyed the lamb. My mom loves the pizza.
I really like the cafe dip lager and it's inexpensive.
The red velvet cake and tartufo were both amazing here as well.

One time I went here and the server was not very good. I told her it was my birthday and she didn't even say happy birthday but that was only one time. The other dozens of times I've been here I have loved it.

Once they gave me the wrong order and they quickly corrected it and gave my ex and I drinks on the house and cake! (it was his birthday).

I think I will always love this place, I haven't found anywhere else where I like the pasta better!!!"}
{"text":"For a three star place, I really enjoy coming here. They have a fantastic patio in the summer. It's usually full so come early! 

The drink menu is standard, but the have a decent beer variety also.

The reason I'm writing a review now is because yesterday I ordered delivery for the first time. It was okay. The chicken parmigiana was slightly drier than usual, but still good.  

The panini: sad face.  The panini had brown lettuce!  Brown! I know usually lettuce doesn't hold up well to heat, but maybe send it separately. The chicken was cooked well. 
The bun: sad face number 2! It wasn't really an appropriate bun for a panini and it wasn't 'grilled' like usual panini's. Truthfully it felt like a microwaved bun with bad lettuce.  

I will probably never order from here again, but will continue to visit all summer! Great patio!"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times to watch soccer games.  Not bad service and food.  I decided to go here on a random Friday night with friends and it was a whole different ball game.  We joined a table of friends who had clearly ordered drinks and food, we tried to get a waiters attention for 45 minutes.  I am not kidding, I kept looking at my watch.  Every time we tried to grab someone they ran by.  When we finally got a waitress she looked pissed off and gave us attitude.  Yes fine, if I was giving you attitude I understand, but f. Am paying for my meal and drinks and still actions very nice to you after waiting for you to check on us 45 minutes later, drop the sass. After ordering my friends were forced to move out of the way (\"you need to get out of the way\" *said rudely with included eye roll*.  You know a simple please move, or sir you are blocking the way please move would have been fine...) a few times, even though there was ample walking room.  Also when we asked for separate bills (between 3 of us, not rocket science) we were told no.  Even after we told the waitress we knew our orders. The answer remained no, no, no.  Everyone at this place looks like they hate life and people.  Get out of the hospitality industry.  I work with drunk people AND I'm Italian, and guess what, since I'm getting PAID at my job I do my job, with a smile, even when I just don't want to.  These waiters/waitresses should do the same, they are a disgrace in little Italy"}
{"text":"Great patio! That's when I start showing up here. Staff are personable and attentive. Food is good - Classic Italian. Love how front and centre the \"create your own\" options are. And they serve peroni which is important to me. I'd recommend the shrimp appetizer. Brochette is meh.

I'll be back for those patio pernonis and kind staff!"}
{"text":"It wasn't classic, very thin-crusted Italian pizza but to me it was just perfect. The right amount of chewy with great cheese-to-sauce ratio. Great service, too."}
{"text":"Great location and a decent patio, but otherwise Cafe Dip is crap. The few times I've been dragged here, the food has been totally weak and I don't like the atmosphere. I hate places like this that exploit a good location to survive despite being weak in all other areas.

Do yourself a favour and walk a block south to Bitondo's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/bitondos-pizzeria-toronto) for a slice or, even better, a panzarotti. If you want something classier, walk a few blocks east to Negroni (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/negroni-toronto) for some killer panini. Want to eat outside? Find a park."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim while killing time during JFL42. It's a nice spot right on the corner with a side patio. They have a great Italian menu. The food came quick. The salad was incredibly fresh and the panini was fine. Would like to return when we have more time and get into the pastas. Friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"I was super starving so I came here for some quick Italiano. 

VIBE 
It's nothing much. Who knew that the movie Chole was filmed here? The humongous poster with the advertisement will tell you. (It is actually kind of cool). 
The patio can't be beat if you're looking to chat with friends over a pitcher. Sangria in the summer! 
And this is the place to be if there is a World Cup happening. 
Staff is friendly but don't rush me and let me keep my menu on the table. 

I ATE
The pizza and drink special for $2.50 plus tax. When did the Dip become a knock off of Pizza Pizza? I love that on the menu it has slashed prices. Not sure that is ever a good sign unless it really is a deal.
It was cafeteria food but as I said, I was hungry. Cheeseburgers and veal sandwiches are also on the discounted price list on the back of the menu. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK
I remember when I was 20 and I thought I was SO cool for coming here. This was the splurge meal. But now a 10 year old can afford this place. It's still a College St. landmark though."}
{"text":"We were talked in off the street and very happily so!  Excellent service, especially for a Friday night!  The fried ravioli is delicious!  The kitchen accommodated us when we wanted to add items to our already large meat antipasto (a few dollars extra and well worth it).  Four of us dined, three ordered entrees and we still had leftovers.  The carbonara was very good but quite buttery - this is the only reason we didn't rate 5 stars.  Excellent americanos!"}
{"text":"Great patio hence two star.....but I've been siting here and no one has served me at 20 mins now.  Others are asking to be a served because they have to leave....
Servers are questioning where the replacement for bar tender is....
Server is taking one plate at a time to \"clean\" 

Just wondering how long it's going to take....god I wish sidecar opened a little earlier I wouldn't have to sit through this ridiculousness....

I'm turning it into a game...:how many times can a server pass by stare at my table realize I have no food no drinks and still walk by

Got a server after asking another server for my server I waited total of 24 mins!!!! Let's see how long the beer takes....oh boy -_-'

Beer came very quickly actually and it's nice and cold.... There's a guy walking asking who ordered a Johnny walkers....he's walked up and down three times now. I'm dying a little inside!!!!"}
{"text":"After walking all over Toronto we happened upon \"The Dip\" and felt lucky. Service was great, patio was nice, cool neighborhood. I had a grilled panini and my wife had chicken parm with penne. Everything was good and the prices were reasonable (relatively speaking in Toronto)."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty big pizza snob coming from Windsor Ontario, and for a while now I've been trying to find pizza that is comparable to my hometown. I've been searching all over Toronto and we decided to give Cafe Diplomatic a try. I've been here a few times and have always had great service. The food is great and the desserts are fantastic. However, on this visit we decided to give their pizza a whirl.

It was fantastic! 

The crust was exquisite, the toppings were great and everything was cooked to perfection. Our service was fairly slow starting off, but apparently several parties decided to get up and pay at once. But our server was very apologetic and even brought us some delicious sauce to go with our pizza.

This experience would have been perfect if they served their pizza with diced or shredded pepperoni! (Yes this is a thing! Look it up!)

We're definitely coming back. This is our new go-to spot for pizza! Also, try the creme br√ªl√©e!"}
{"text":"When the weather was warmer awhile back (oh how long ago that was!), my friend and I wanted to find a nice patio to eat out on. We trekked along College St. to see if there were anything that tickled our fancy. We saw Cafe Diplomatico and their patio looked pretty decent. I wanted to simply check out the menu to see if there was anything that I would like to try. When we went in to pick up the menu, the owner (or at least I think he was), started ushering us in. He assured us that the food was going to be fantastic and there was no reason to hesitate. My friend and I were walking for quite some time now and the food seemed decent. So in we went!

I wasn't craving pizza, so I tried out their Tuna Melt sandwich. It was pretty tasty. My friend enjoyed his medium pizza and beer. He said that the beer was cheaper than in most restaurants. A pitcher of Bone Shaker was only $20, comparatively to $22-23 at most restaurants.

Overall, I had a pleasant time at Cafe Diplomatico. It was full by the time we were all settled in, probably because of the interaction the owner had with everyone passing by on the street! Would I come back? I think once is enough for me, but it's a nice patio along College if you are looking for one."}
{"text":"That's right, yet another review of the Dip. I just can't help myself, after staggering home from here yesterday evening in a state of bliss. I just feel it deserves some love.

Completely agree with most of the reviews below, in that:

1) The patio is awesome (5 star)

2) The food is pretty terrible (2 star)

Therefore, I don't eat the food here (after 2-3 disappointing meals over the last few years)

But now that summer is in full swing, the Dip patio is likely to be a weekly occurrence for me. I've been twice already this past week and so far the service has been great, the wine, sangria and beer refreshing and the people watching absolutely top notch. 

Go, but eat somewhere else first."}
{"text":"We chose to stop there with a Hot Docs film playing next door at the Royal being very convenient. We ordered the Uncle Paul's Antipasto which included:

grilled portobello mushrooms,
grilled eggplant,
grilled artichokes,
bocconcino cheese, 
sliced tomatoes
& olives.
$16

The tomatoes were tasteless. The grilled eggplant was in a form that I have never seen before, looked like it was pickled, and was tasteless. Everything else was out of a jar. Extremely strong on the pickled juices. Horrible. 

In fairness we did not stay to try the pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Not overly amazing but a solid pasta. It's a nice place to chill on the patio (minus the creepy old drunk men hitting on teenagers). The service was friendly and relatively quick."}
{"text":"Was so disappointed with the service, the server had one job to ring the food out to everyone at once and that seemed to be a challenge.
The management was unapologetic and good little ownership dying the entire process. Food was great if you don't mind eating alone after everyone else is finished."}
{"text":"Stopped to eat here while visiting Toronto for a weekend. I'm a bit hesitant when eating out of town but the pizza was delicious. My husband and I really enjoyed it as well as the service which we received. Everything was superb. If we ever visit Toronto again I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Casual and cozy, comfortable with a great patio.  This year to celebrate its 50 years they have a throwback menu which features $0.30 espresso and delicious pasta pomodoro for $7.50 and more!

If you're a soccer (futball) you'll love it here, ambiance and atmosphere is in full swing when it comes to sports.  

Lots of films have filmed here including Magnolia (with Julianne Moore).

Foodwise, pizza and cannolis are fresh and delicious.  There is also gluten free options 

The waiter/servers are friendly, patio is heated with a screen outside (as well as inside), good food, good coffee, good beer--what more would you want?

Free wifi also available 

Gelato also available 

Weekends are always busy here and they have an early bird menu where breakfast is slightly cheaper before 8am 

Come for the history and stay for people watching!"}
{"text":"Average is the best word I can describe this place with. After an unsuccessful attempt to find parking at a karaoke bar in little Italy, we decided to park at a paid public parking by Clinton St. and stroll around College street. Quite frankly, their Xmas lights and the high number of customers on top of their ad referring to \"DineTo\" dragged us here. I happily asked them to make the pizza shown in their menu. Unfortunately, what they brought to our table looked nothing like their advertised pizza picture and they didn't even bother putting spinach despite discussing it beforehand. They didn't bother telling us that they don't have spinach!  The pizza is the kind you find at pretty much anywhere else in Toronto with even cheaper price.

Almost forgot to mention: they squeezed the enormous pizza slices in a tiny doggie bag!  When I opened it at home I saw a smashed stack of pizza with no layering paper. Way to go for a super professional to go packing!"}
{"text":"Although I love Italian food but I think the food here are poor quality. Service is not good either!"}
{"text":"Now, I have not been to this place in quite some time, and there is a good reason for that; but it may leave me a little less than qualified to give the most objective, scientific assessment possible. 

Living, as I have, on the outskirts of Little Italy for over four years has made it impossible for me to remain unaware of \"the Dip\" (ick) and its epic presence on this strip. While still newcomers to the neighbourhood, my (ex-) roomie and I decided we had to check out this place we were hearing so much about. Unimpressive service (I had to go find my own ketchup, while the waitress watched and kind of directed me from her seat), and less than average food made me reluctant to go back. And I haven't been able to do it again. Yes, ever (so yeah, for those keeping track, I've only been there once).

Once again, not the fairest way to form an educated opinion, I know. But, after all the mixed reviews I have received from others, and the clincher- a Toronto guide book I that I saw a couple years ago call the food \"mediocre\" and the service something in the realm of \"bad\"- all while acknowledging that people knew, accepted this and continued to flock there!!-- convinced me that I absolutely could not buy into the idea of a \"hotspot\" built on a reputation of never quite measuring up, but still coming out on top."}
{"text":"I guess I'm one of the non-believers, because I really don't care about this place. I mean, it's OK, it's in a good location, the food is typical white-people \"Italian\". So I really don't get why people love it so much!

Personally I can't stand waiting in line for food that I don't dream about. They serve pasta, sandwiches and salads. Big whoop. You can, and will, get much better Italian food anywhere else on College street without waiting in line for 5 years. If you're dead set on learning about this \"Toronto legend\" then go during the day, in the middle of the week. Forget about Friday nights, and don't even think about going on a summer weekend -- the patio will be packed.

The only thing here that is absolutely unbearable is their breakfast. Literally I have made far more exciting meals for myself at home. The basic eggs, toast and homefries might only be $3.50 or so, but I'd argue that it's not even worth that. Only venture here for breakfast in moments of extreme desperation.

I say, if you're visiting Toronto and you want some authentic Italian cooking, go up to St. Clair or find another awesome place on College, because there are tons and they are way more authentic. To me, Cafe Diplomatico reminds me of those Gotti boys -- they think they're Italian, but when it comes down to it, they're just greasy wannabes."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed, when simple pasta, italian fare and half litre vino is $75 for two. Would return for the coffee. And seriously, enough with the iceberg lettuce :-)"}
{"text":"Oh cafe diplomatico the years have been kind to you, your prices have also.

In my poor college years we used to come here for all you could eat spaghetti on Saturday.. I groan with delicious remembrance.. We would eat so much! To the point it was gross, full replent. Go home have a nap then wake up and go dancing at the dance cave!"}
{"text":"Loved the place. Super friendly waiters and the owner greets you himself. Good food and totally affordable. Delicious (!!!!!!!!!!) desserts and a huge selection of that and fancy drinks too!"}
{"text":"The sandwich I ate was the kind you'd serve a 5 year-old who will barely eat anything and has to have the crusts cut off his sandwich.  On the other hand, the patio is first rate.  If you are looking to have a coffee or a beer, walk by and spot a good patio spot then go for it... otherwise I'd pass.  Note - I've only been once but I'm not sure the food deserves a repeat.  The rating is a three, sort of an average, because the food is one or two and the patio is a five.  Service was middling."}
{"text":"Is it possible to leave less than one star?

I have come to this restaurant several times and although I never found it outstanding, I would have previously rated it around 3 stars. But my last experience set me off so much I find myself on Yelp complaining.

The restaurant seemed understaffed. Although I would feel for the waiters/waitressed normally (if I saw that they were working hard and trying) the waitress we had was extremely rude and unfriendly. Any little request or question was met with an eye roll. And when my water still had not arrived in 15 minutes, I asked again, and she snapped, \"I'm just getting it!\" followed by a look that could kill. I work in customer service myself and am by no means a difficult customer, but I do expect to be treated kindly when I'm spending money at a restaurant.

Then I got my food, which to their credit arrived shockingly fast. I ordered Chicken Parmasean, and the chicken was not even a REAL chicken breast! What I received was some sort of lukewarm breaded mechanically seperated \"white meat chicken product\" like you would get in the frozen section of Sobey's. Call me crazy but for $12 or $13 dollars (I forget the exact price) I DO expect a decent quality food item to be served to me, not some nasty oversized McDonalds chicken nugget with tomato sauce and cheese on it. To be completely fair, the pasta and meat sauce that my friend had was very good, but this whole experience has set me off and I definately won't be returning. There are too many higher quality restaurants in the area.

My suggestion to the restaurant: If you cant afford to offer food of decent quality, you should raise your menu prices, because mechanically seperated chicken is not exactly restaurant quality, and customers DO notice."}
{"text":"The waiter forgot our order and with two kids starving it was hell. Hour and a half to get our food. On top of that they were rude about it. Never coming here again"}
{"text":"Very slow service, wait staff seemed very frustrated,  one of the bartenders was swearing while talking to his co-worker, loud enough for our table to hear."}
{"text":"\"Psst,\" the waiter said to me: \"The food here is mediocre, but the sangria is a killer. Once you try it you won't want to leave.\"

He wasn't kidding. My grilled cheese sandwich (which is admittedly difficult to screw up) was expensive ($4.50 without a side) and forgettable, but the pitchers of sangria were outrageously boozy and fruity. 

At $30 a pitcher (you can't buy it by the glass) for red or white wine sangria, it was the priciest pitcher I'd ever had, but I got my alcohol's worth. Concentrated, fruity goodness served in a beautiful and sleek glass carafe. 

I wasn't exactly wooed by the several dozen fruit flies floating around in the white wine sangria carafe but I wasn't completely turned off either, and I can only attribute this to the month of July - aka fruit fly season in Toronto. I've probably inadvertently swallowed hundreds of them in the past month. And the fruit in the carafe WAS enticing -- evidently to fruit flies as much as to humans -- mangoes, orange segments and whole cherries. So order the sangria but ask them to hold the fruit flies, and be sure to inspect before you swill."}
{"text":"My review is based only on my experience getting coffee the other morning. My husband and I stopped in for an espresso, and almost immediately regretted it. This place is dingy and sad-looking in the morning. Maybe it's passable in the evening, but in the bright morning sun, not so much. The espresso was harsh. Even harsher than this review... I asked the man preparing it what kind of coffee he used and he pointed across the way toward the cash register, and said, \"that one.\" Yikes. Not my kinda place."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Price per person including drink: 30
Environment: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Summary: a nice place to hang out with friends, however, the food is just an OK.

I came to this place with a meetup group. There were 7 of us, and we had variety of food.
Pizza: OK
Pasta: OK
Calamari: Good, but sauce was bad
This place is not cheap and it is in the middle of little Italy. I thought we are going to have the best Italian food, but it turns out that it was just OK. Pizza is just slightly better than Pizza Pizza. Pasta was small portion and taste so so. I like the Calamari, but not the sauce.
Recommend: not really"}
{"text":"The dirrrrty Dip. 

When in Little Italy this place is tempting. Huge bustling patio, authentic sounding menu and a great location. 

In University I would love to drink Sangria, chain smoke and nosh on the antipasto plate on the Dip patio. Simpler times. Even then I knew the food was meh, but it was a relatively affordable place to snack and drink and feel grown-up. 

They have daily specials that are large portions running between $8-$14. I am not a fan of their pasta, and I once had what tasted like frozen lasagna here. But you know, a girl's gotta eat. I guess I've just outgrown this place..."}
{"text":"Food is typical Italo-pub fare, which is to say, somewhat uninspired. Drinks are pricey, though no more so than comparable places on College. I went here during a World Cup game, and it was hopping. A passable place to go if you're walking down College and want a bite to eat, but there are better places nearby. Caf√© Liberatto is just a jaunt down the street, and offers far better (albeit pricier) pizza."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot for pizza.  Today i decided to venture into the menu and try something new.  Our waitress was a poor listener.  I ordered the meat ball dish with no mozzarella.  It arrived with mozzarella! She was so busy that she rarely checked on my table.  I didnt bother to complain eventhough I cannot eat cheese.  My friend ordered white wine mussels, it was a huge portion, its a shame they didnt taste so great.  I think Ill just stick to pizza and dessert when I go back."}
{"text":"We went there for dessert. I ordered the carrot cake and blueberry specialty tea;while my husband had the tiramisu. Both were lovely. Service was really good. It's nice place to visit if you're in Little Italy"}
{"text":"...I am picky....
I dont like eating out, and I am picky with my food.
I went to Cafe Diplomatico on the night of April 4 2016, around 11 PM (!)

Nothing was open around the area mostly. I was hungry for pizza. I expected a decent pie with flaws at this time of night.
I walked into CD and knew of their slice but was nervous about CD's pies.
It is very rare for me to eat out and when I order a pizza pie, I always find at least one flaw about the pie...

Asked if they offer pies at this time of night, got a yes, ordered my pie and sat on the table using their fast and free wifi. Waited about 15 minutes and got my pie in a white box to go.

Wow! I had the most flawless pizza pie I have ever had in years!
I ordered a medium double cheese with bocconcini and basil and it was flawless!
No black / charred areas on either side!
Barely-their crust, with perfect level of crispness and moistness!
Perfect dough; not to thin and not overly bready!
The cheese was thick and chewy and stretchy and almost covered the edge.

I finished the pie about 15 minutes after purchase. All of it!

I never do reviews like this or care to share reviews outside of friends but I just had to let the world know that I hope to be back and recommend to friends and coworkers."}
{"text":"I absolutely do not understand why some folks have given this place less than 5 stars. I'd give 6 out of 5 if I could.

I'm visiting Toronto from Berkeley, CA. One thing I love doing when I travel is to wander around interesting neighborhoods, and so I spent a couple of hours walking around the residential neighborhood of \"Little Italy\" behind College Street. When I walked by Caf√© Diplomatico the first time, at about 4 pm, the courtyard was teeming with happy people drinking their beers and eating (for the most part) pizza. By 6 I was really hungry, so I decided to give it a try.

My overall impression is that this is a place that cares a lot about the customer. Although the place was packed, I was seated in a jiffy. (In fact, while I was having dinner, I saw four staff members improvise a large seating for an unannounced party of 9, in record time, without disturbing any of the other patrons.)

I had the special -- grilled veal -- which was delicious: nicely marinated and done to a turn. There were tons of different desserts, and I chose the white chocolate and fruit mousse cake, which did not disappoint, along with a decaf espresso that tasted like it was made in Italy.

But best of all was the impeccable extra-mile service I received from Virginia, who was friendly yet genuine, attentive without being pushy. I cannot recall ever seeing a more professional server.

The price was completely reasonable for what I got -- $23.70.

True, the interior does not shout \"fancy restaurant,\" but neither do the best trattorias in Italy. It's clean and comfortable and simple, and that was perfect."}
