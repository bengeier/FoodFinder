{"text":"Absolutely love this place me and my boyfriend are regulars heres after trying it. They also deliver and have pickup if you don't feel like dining in which is great with a busy schedule. The peanut delight is alway a great go to my personal favorite is the panang chicken curry. Lots of options for if you are vegetarian or if you eat meat."}
{"text":"This is a great local restaurant with a variety of mild-to-spicy offerings. I enjoy the Panang Chicken Curry and Roti. Eat in or take out. I found a good open WiFi signal there recently. The staff is friendly and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Excellent curry! Love the sweet potato chicken curry. Very impressed and a great price"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, the service is fantastic, and the rewards program is ridiculously good.   My family eats here about once a week. They will alter the recipes for mild taste buds. Favorites are yummy green bean, roti, pineapple curry, and red squash curry. The owners are really friendly, remember your name, and always have good recommendations. So happy they are on my side of town."}
{"text":"Good food, have some mild-spicy options and reasonably priced.  The sweet potato Curry was excellent and the sweet and sour chicken dish was good as well.  A good choice in Fitchburg."}
{"text":"Great food, service and value. If you haven't stopped by since the remodel it's time to go back. Awesome for lunch. I had the chicken panang and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Massaman curry was good but the pad Thai was terrible. Nothing fresh and overly spiced with low quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how well versed these reviewers are on what is \"authentic\" I ordered the Chiang Mai Noodle off the lunch menu... it was sticky, tasteless, and the \"lo mien noodles\" they used were packaged Top Ramen that was so over cooked, it was a congealed mess. The Rama Chicken my fiance ordered was soupy, and the peanut sauce was so sweet, it tasted like peanut butter. The Crab Rangoon were almost burned, and the \"pot stickers\" were more like soggy Wontons. If I could give this place a lower rating, I would. All that I ordered I ate literally 1 bite of, and could not stomach another. I just threw out $27 of food, and I will never make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Customer service FAIL! Food was good, actually some of the better curry I have had in the Madison area. However, my wife has some food sensitivities (I know.. one of those people) but it clearly states on posted signs that they can make most any dish to order. My wife doesn't like, and is sensitive to bell peppers.. green, red, etc. She asked for them to be excluded from the dish which they said they can certainly do. Food arrives, and sure enough has red pepper in it. The owner / manager was helping serve the food and said.. \"no, there is no pepper in this.: My wife looking right at it pulled it out and showed her.. the owner / manager then says \"well just pick it out.\" Which was not something I have EVER heard a server, manager, owner say to a customer before.. except maybe a fast food place. The dish should have been remade.. end of story. We are all pretty blown away by how horrible her response was to the dish being made incorrectly.  It's a shame because the food was great, but with great food should come great service as well.. which this place is lacking BIG TIME!   If you don't care about customer service go for it.. if that is at least somewhat important to you, dine at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Best Tom ka soup in town! I also love the Pad kee Mao. Great vegetarian and vegan options!"}
{"text":"Great little curry place in Fitchburg! We were skeptical upon entering as there were only a few people inside and the ambiance is a bit drab, but the food is quite good! I would say it is a very good and slightly cheaper alternative to Ha Long Bay and Sa Bai Thong."}
{"text":"Penang Curry with chicken was very good. Plenty of heat with a sweet, Caribbean-like flavor. I thought it was very unique and would return for this dish.   The Pad Thai was so-so. Not enough heat for the maximum spice level.   Friendly service, but pretty high prices for the quantity and the location ($9-11 per entree). Given that I felt this place could be termed Americanized Thai food, I did not think it was worthy of the price point. Nonetheless, the Penang curry tasted good-- if you go, you should get it!"}
{"text":"I have great news, my loong and agonizing search for tasty well balanced Thai food it's over! I declare myself a fan of this place :) :)   I had their sweet potato chicken curry and what a quality of ingredients! Vegetables right on point, not hard, not soft, chicken cut thin and so well made! Flavors wonderfully balanced of salty, sweet and spicy. Besides, the dish has the perfect portion size, usually when I ate curries at other places I ended up with a belly like if I swallowed a whole cow! This time I finished with a big smile in my face of such comforting experience :) my hubby had the lamb curry and it had a nice earthy tomato based sauce, I even tasted like a hint of cinnamon. He liked it. The Roti bread ahhhhhhhh..... Super yummyy with such an interesting taste like if it was cooked in an open flame difficult to forget!! And last but not least, their Thai iced tea, deliciously sweet (not too sweet) finished with half and half on top which, for some reason I loved to discover, it matched perfectly with our food. Very nice staff also,  I CANT wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Somehow the online menu made me lose my appetite? I cant really even explain why exactly?My friend said it was\"good\",so I checked out the menu,and well, yeah.....Get a different webpage, and change your name."}
{"text":"Curry in the Box is consistently decent. It's not spectacular, but it's predictable and tastes quite good. The renovations are nice, and the atmosphere has improved considerably.   In the past, I have gotten Panang Chicken, Roti, Volcano Chicken, Crab Rangoon, and Spring Rolls. All of them are tasty and flavored well, and remarkably reasonably priced.   The service is excellent; the people are friendly and the food is ready very quickly. It's a great place to go for a quick, cheap dinner.  In my opinion, Sa Bai Thong is the best Thai food in Madison, but Curry in the Box is a close second."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing bases on the Midvale location. Let me start by saying the only reason for four instead of five stars is that it's casual dining.  The manager/owners office space is front and center, and could perhaps use a screen, but that's okay.    On to the food! My favorite 5 star dish is the squash curry.  It's the best I've ever had. The broth is amazing.  The staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great curry and some nice jazz in background. Loved the peanut sauce.  Will be coming back to try other dishes"}
{"text":"I like this place and have been a handful of times.  The curry is ok, which is what you need to know.  It is a quick, over the counter joint and the curry is ok.  Not showing off and not falling behind....the meaty part of the curve if you will.    Parking can be a bit of an issue.  They share a lot with Starbucks and it looks like there is a crowd chilling in SB while I am looking for a space in the lot to pick up my curry!  Not good.    Finally I like the diversity of the menu.  You can venture through Asia and India on their menu pretty quickly.  Sometimes I smile looking at my plate in the diversity.  Go, it isn't gourmet but for a late night dinner, I'm there."}
{"text":"Five of six of my family loved the food from Curry in the box.  The sixth (me) liked it enough to agree to get take out from here for them twice within three days. The Sweet Potato Curry and Chicken Satay in particular stood out.  It did seem to me that the portions seemed small for the cost compared with other Thai take out options in Madison area.    I was completely satisfied with the take out  service (ordering on phone, promptness of order being ready at time committed, quick in and out pick up of food).  If you want Thai OR Indian in Madison there are better options, but if you want both, this is a really great reason to consider Curry in the Box."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, super fast service, consistent quality in their food, lots of veggies in the meals - we love this place for a quick dinner out or ordering in! Atmosphere is similar to Noodles or Panera."}
{"text":"Moved to the Madison Area from Milwaukee, and happen to come across this place when going somewhere else that ended up being closed. Got the Chicken Karae (spelling?) and it was delicious. They offer brown rice, which was made really well. My husband got the special of the day and thoroughly enjoyed it. Would go here again for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery and did not receive anything after two hours. If you don't want to wait do not order from this restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped at this place on a whim as we were driving to Milwaukee. IT IS DELICIOUS! Even though it is an order at the counter place, it took about 15 minutes to get food, which means it was made fresh and not just scooped out of a pot. I do not eat meat and got the tofu and it was great. It seemed flash fried to perfection. Wonderful without seeming greasy. I would 100 percent recommend this place."}
{"text":"Placed order online and was told would be ready for pickup at 1:48. Arrived at 1:55 and not ready. So asked to add 1 piece of Roti to order. At 2:10 still no order. Asked about it and was told they were busy. There was 1 other party in the whole place. At 2:15 he told me they were \"making the roti now\". Seriously? 1) I ordered it 20 min who 2) It's a tortilla for goodness sake. Forget it! Got my $1.29 back and left with the order that I guess had been sitting waiting for that single roti. Ridiculous!!! Left at 2:20, 25 minutes after arriving to pick up my food. Gave it 2 stars because the food was pretty good but no more stars because I won't go back."}
{"text":"The Fish Hatchery location has been a must stop for me for years now. I always hoped they would expand to a location with more visibility and traffic, because this place was a hidden gem.  There are probably 30 different curries you can order, all of which are incredibly flavorful and colorful.  They also have noodle dishes for the less adventurous, and Roti bread that's basically doughy mouth crack.  The atmosphere is first rate for a counter service joint, and the owners are incredibly nice and gracious.  Couldn't be happier about this new location. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in the Madison area. Me and my friends found this gem and for the rest of the summer proceeded to order from here once a week. Their delivery service even came directly to campus! The sweet potato curry is by far one of my favorites and their roti can't be beat. My only compliment is that I'm not in Wisconsin anymore to eat here!"}
{"text":"This place seems sort of like a noodles and co or chipotle for curry. The space is approachable but feels a little cookie cutter and insincere. I ordered a lunch special, the pineapple curry with tofu. I was glad to see lots of vegan options and a note that they would accommodate special requests. The person at the counter was friendly. There is a tip screen that pops up if you use a credit card, which feels a little awkward; I did leave a tip, but it isn't really a full service restaurant. The food came after about five minutes and was hot. The sauce was good. I was super disappointed by the canned pineapple. Seems like a signature type dish that is one of the lunch specials should have fresh ingredients. It was okay for a sort of fast food option, but not something I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Ordered the Japanese Yellow Curry and Pad Thai last night for delivery and it came earlier than expected which was great!  I added one spice level to the Japanese Curry, and we added two to the Pad Thai.  They had a decent bite, but not as much as I expected with a heat increase.    I'd say the Japanese Curry was the better of the two, though the Pad Thai wasn't bad by any means.  I've eaten a lot of Thai in Portland, OR and I'd say this rates middle-of-the-ground compared to the Thai out there.  The noodles weren't as sticky as I prefer, and the flavor was a little bland, though the preparation of the dish was how I prefer so I may be able to tweak the order a bit.  I'd get it again, but the Japanese Curry was much better imo.    I'll be trying some other dishes in the future, as this place is not far from my house and they've pleasantly surprised me thus far!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is delicious, the prices are right, and the service is generally pretty quick.  About the only thing I don't absolutely love is the location - it was far more convenient when you could get this stuff downtown - but I'm sure people who live on the south side are happy to have it.  The menu is more Thai than anything else, but there are a few Mandarin items and a couple of Indian-inspired dishes.  Everything I've had has been satisfying, though I think the tikka masala and chicken karee are some of their best dishes.  The massaman curry is slightly disappointing compared to other Thai restaurants - it seems a bit watered down - but it's not a total failure.  I also enjoy some of their appetizers/sides (spring rolls, curry purses, roti), and their willingness to adjust the spice level of their dishes is much appreciated!  The atmosphere is fine, but not fancy.  It's probably best as a lunch or takeout venture.  Make sure to visit their website first, as they generally have coupons you can print for a few dollars off."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and the wait staff is awful. I stood there for 15 minutes while they finished up my take-out order. (1 entrée)  It turns out my food was sitting on the counter behind the cashier, but I guess she couldn't be bothered to turn around and look for it.  The other location doesn't seem to have this problem, totally unprofessional."}
{"text":"This place was alright though I have very high expectations for curry based on my experience at the St. Louis Anis Hyderabad Restaurant (shout out!). This is what I ordered: - chicken sweet potato curry - excellent dish!!! by far the very based of what I tried and worth ordering again and again. the sweet potato was definitely the star. - chicken pad thai - didn't really care for this - tom yum soup - not bad,strong lime flavor - lamb curry - normally my favorite dish at indian places but this one wasn't very good, beware the whole spices! they are not a pleasant surprise! :p - roti paratha - these were pretty good (a little greasy but to be expected since roti  paratha is a fried flour tortilla) - veggie samosa - alright as well, comes with a yummy dipping sauce.  So this place was ok in general though the sweet potato curry is really good. The actually location has really nice bright decor. Enjoyable to visit."}
{"text":"We stopped by 3 in the noon and are surprised , as they did serve yummy and hot lunch even though we are the only customers .  The place is a well maintained with neatly arranged tables which can fit a max of 50 customers at a time , it is even well located which is just a minute or two away from main street . We unexpectedly dined in here as we are traveling through , and it happened to be a odd time to visit a restaurant. They serve explicit asian cuisine and we are pretty much satisfied  with the food . I ordered indian and my hubby ordered thai , which are both full of authentic flavors .  The price is expensive as it is not a fine dine but the quality of the food really made up to the price .   I recommend this restaurant to dine in for asian food ."}
{"text":"This place is not good. We've given it a couple of tries since everybody has a bad day once in a while. The food was really just never tasty. Most of the time it was poorly seasoned or way over salted. It also really bugs me that this is classified as an Indian and Thai restaurant. It's probably the worst Indian food I've tasted in Madison. If they just called themselves a Thai restaurant and changed the names on their menu, I might have given them two stars."}
{"text":"Disappointed is the only way to describe my encounter with Curry in the Box.  I purchased a coupon from Get My Perks and I tried to used it the second day from the last that it expired.  Unfortunately I did not read the fine print very carefully, it said dine in only.  I had already ordered ahead and had it ready for carry out.  When I got there the cashier pointed out to me that the coupon did say dine in only, she then got a manager for me.  Even after pleading with the manager, he insisted that he would not honor the coupon.  He said that the coupon was designed to get new people to come in the door.  I explained that I was a new customer and had never been there before and that I wouldn't have come in if it hadn't been for the coupon, so it worked.  If I had liked it I would be coming back as a return customer.  Still he was insisted he would not honor the coupon.  He said if I would like they would un bag it and let me sit in the dining room and eat it ????? What the heck!  My husband was at home waiting for me so I was not about to eat it at a restaurant by myself.  In the end the manager decided to let me walk out and not accept the coupon on food that was already made, bagged and ready to go.  He told me I could come back some other time to use the coupon, even though I already explained that it expired the next day.  Even though I really wanted to try the food at Curry in the Box I decided that I would not be a customer now or in the future due to the complete lack of respect and rudeness that I was treated with. Get My Perks graciously credited my account the money that I spent on the coupon for future use."}
{"text":"Fast, easy, and SO GOOD. I am pretty picky (won't touch cilantro or spicy food) but they are happy to make changes to menu items when I ask. It's a really nice fast-casual atmosphere, and there's outdoor seating so I always bring my dog in the warmer months. They also have a good selection of bottled beverages, including beer. I'd eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"Great food- both the yellow and red curries are very good.  Lots of vegetarian choices as well and menu has surprising depth.  Storefront strip-mall type location has no personality, however.  I'd recommend takeout rather than eating in.  Prices are a little high for lunch- $8.50-$9.00 ish, but there are a few lunch specials in the $6.00 range."}
{"text":"Cindy  The food was delicious as usual but the portions have gotten considerably smaller.  A bit disappointing for the price."}
{"text":"I don't know why it's taken me this long to review Curry in the Box. Quite simply, this place is delicious. It's not a cheap, greasy Asian restaurant where you get a pound of food for $10. It's wonderful, fresh ingredients that cost what they're worth. My favorite is the sweet potato curry with chicken and a thick spring roll with rice paper wrapped so thin it looks like cellophane, stuffed full with crisp cabbage. The spring roll comes with peanut sauce actually made with chopped peanuts. The sweet potato curry is a perfect mix of sweet & spicy. Yum. All around one of my favorite, reliable places on the west side of Madison. You can't go wrong with Curry in the Box."}
{"text":"This is my regular haunt for when I'm in a mood for curry!  Nice decor and open dining area,  there's enough space in the adjoining room for a large group.   I love the spiciness and heat of their jungle curry. The Chicken Tikka Masala is a real winner here.  I love that it comes in a shredded form instead of The chunky form. The sweet potato curry is also very good with soft morsels of sweet potato.  I hate it when places serve hard chunks of sweet potato in their dishes.   I would stick with the curries and pass on the appetizers.  The Samosa did not have much filling to it and the egg rolls were pretty standard."}
{"text":"The masaman, karee, panang, sweet potato curries are all wonderful. The kids meals are ridiculously small (equivalent to 3 chicken nuggets for $4) and only one sauce is permitted. Tried to get my daughter to branch out & try something other than the kids' menu.  She picked Pad Thai. It was redder than what I am used to seeing. She did not like the noodles & I thought \"cool, lunch for me.\" Then I took a bite. It was so overwhelmingly fishy. So fishy I spit it out. After drinking half a raspberry soda, I can still taste that fish. If you like fish, this may be the dish for you, but I found it disgusting. Never straying from curry again."}
{"text":"My family has certain affection for this restaurant. It does a good job serving healthy Thai-Asian dishes. My favorite is the Jungle Curry Dish. It is great for families since it's often not busy. Most of their business comes from phoned in orders and pick-ups which they are very quick on. They expanded the restaurant last year so there's lots of seating. The decor is bland but clean. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Please try this restaurant. It's a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from here for years. It's been hit or miss all over the menu. After calling and talking to staff, we were told that they like to take standard Asian recipes and \"do their own thing\" and modify it. We've tried close to half the menu, and are not happy with their modifications.  The Pad Thai lacks a few of the fresh ingredients that make any pad Thai sophisticated and good. The crab Rangoon we got was completely dry, it's hard to think of a worse one! Several other curries hardly stand out, and seem to always have too many veggies and not enough sauce. The Chicken Manchurian looked and tasted nothing like any chicken Manchurian I've ever seen on a menu, and was bland to boot. When I spoke to the staff, they explained that this is \"their version\" of chicken Manchurian. Which apparently means the chicken isn't fried, there's no sauce, no scallion, no onion, and is mostly stir fried broccoli and carrots.   If you are going to \"modify\" a standard Asian recipe by removing most of the ingredients and cooking it differently, don't call it by the same name!! We feel cheated, and we are getting rather tired of feeling cheated half the time we order food from here. The Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Curry, and simpler Thai curries (red, yellow) have kept us coming back. Not frequently, alas."}
{"text":"Best little curry place for a little curry place! Truly enjoyed the food the rice a drink and the staff."}
{"text":"Thai food that is as good, if not better, than any in Thai restaurants. The portion was generous and the souce was flavorful and not so thick.  I had the jungle curry. Medium spicy is true to description (ie. It has a good kick but not overwhelming)."}
{"text":"We love the pad thai chicken and jungle curry. 5 star takeout."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here and I wish I would have called in my order.  A young woman took my order, and I had a seat while I waited. The staff was pretty young, and they were bullying a newer staff member. It was hard to listen to. I was grateful when my food was brought out to me! I ordered the pad thai for my husband, and the masaman curry for myself. We also got the eggrolls for apps. The pad thai was ok - definitely heavy on the fish sauce. Hubby liked it just fine, but I was glad it wasn't mine. The masaman curry was great! The eggrolls were heavy, and didn't have enough stuffing, but the dipping sauce was delicious. Also on a good note - the prices are really good! You definitely get your money's worth here.  I will go back, skip the pad thai, and will order ahead to avoid listening to high school drama while waiting."}
{"text":"Service is good, considering it was lunch hour during the week it wasn't too slow. I got the panag curry with tofu and brown rice. It was very savory, but NOT at all spicy! Was supposed to be medium but I didn't notice even the slightest heat. Next time I will request spicy. The veggies were superb and delicious. My mom got the pad Thai. Which wasn't very good. It seemed to have more of a tomato sauce base and barely a peanut flavor, also no egg. I'd come back for the curry but that's it!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food, and CITB has my FAVORITE dish in town! Sweet potato curry with tofu and brown rice--I order this at least once a week. It is so tasty with the perfect amount of spice, tons of veggies, and I really appreciate that they offer brown rice. So easy to order and pick up to go and the staff is really nice and helpful. Amazing, vegan friendly & healthy food!"}
{"text":"Wow. This is hands down my favorite place to eat in Madison. Every curry I've had elsewhere since eating at Curry in the Box is a let down in comparison. My favorite dish is the Sweet Potato Curry, but the Pineapple Curry is also very good. The staff is very nice, the food is quick, and the restaurant is clean and inviting.  Curry in the Box also had a great loyalty program. Every dollar you spend there, you get a point, and each point is worth 10 cents. So you essentially get a dollar back for every meal you eat there. After about 6 meals, they sent me a free $10 gift certificate to use, and I'm only 3 points away from my next certificate! They also send out mailers with \"double points\" offers to rack up your points even more. I love good rewards programs!  The only negative is that the prices are slightly high. I don't mind paying them because I really love the food, but I wish it were a dollar or two cheaper. The lunch menu prices are excellent though, so if you have time to make it during the day, it will be well worth it.  Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"YUM! You don't have to love curry to stop in and give it a try. Many different options to choose on the menu! SO good."}
{"text":"The curry tastes good but a bit salty. Given the reasonable price I will come back if I'm craving for Thai curry."}
{"text":"I am new to curry.   Curry in the Box is consistently flavorful. For those who like more heat they readily make everything to order, fresh and tasty. With all the dining options in Madison, this has become one of my favorites. Once in awhile we order out for work and Curry in the Box is what everyone wants."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVER. Delicious food and nice employees! My Sweet Potato Curry was so yummy I want to rewind time so I can eat it again... definitely best curry place I've ever tried. A lot of places will have a yellow curry with potato and onion and that's it. This Sweet Potato Curry has broccoli, thinly sliced carrots, onions, zucchini, and the awesome sweet potato chunks. What?! Amazing.. for sure a bang for your buck. It was only $8.95 or something. It can easily be 2 meals but I can't stop myself so tonight it will be just the 1"}
{"text":"What a dilemma! So many tempting dishes on the menu and I can only order one.  The quality of the ingredients and preparation easily matches any Asian restaurant in town. But with the counter service and informal atmosphere, I enjoy bargain prices.   I don't recommend the small- sized egg rolls. Everything else on the menu has been a delightful dining experience.  And, obvious effort has been devoted to keeping the place clean. I highly recommend Curry in a Box."}
{"text":"Overall our takeout experience was good. The service receives four and a half stars and the food three and a half. On the plus side, in the two curry dishes that we ordered, the vegetables were fresh cut and tasted great. They were both chicken-based dishes and frankly, my wife thought that there was too little chicken in each of the plates.  I couldn't detect much heat or spiciness in each of the dishes. I did order the vegetarian egg rolls and frankly the wrapper was thick (which I liked a lot) but my wife thought there was too little filling. The interior of the restaurant is very nice and on Sunday evening was very quiet. I think that for basic curry with not a lot of heat you will find this good  for  the price."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the peanut sauce was great. I am glad that I ordered it three stars hotter than the base though. That said, the rest of my meal was underwhelming. I ordered the breaded chicken and broccoli in peanut sauce with extra chicken, delivery.   The container my food arrived in was barely a third full and that was with the extra chicken. I counted a total of eight small broccoli florets in the thin layer of peanut sauce. The chicken was clearly frozen and not fresh.   I also ordered a few chicken egg rolls. Not only were they incredibly small and thusly overpriced, but they were not fully cooked and tasted a bit off. Finally, the jasmin rice was so overcooked that I ended up just tossing the remainder of the dish in the trash. I also ordered a single order of the bread.  The entire meal cost $20+, not including delivery or tip. I could have saved half that cost by ordering the same meal from the local Chinese restaurant and received larger portions and better quality."}
{"text":"I am basing this review on one visit. I will return to Curry in a Box ASAP and post an update.   I love Thai curry. I find that I am often disappointed when the sauce is overly greasy or the consistency of water. I want to taste the curry and feel\" the burn\" without the overall flavors disappearing in the heat. Curry in the Box hit the nail on the head. I ordered the Green Curry with chicken. The ratio of chicken,to rice, to broccoli, to bamboo shoots was just right. I liked the rice which was a little firm in texture which enhanced the overall experience.  The restaurant was unremarkable but I enjoyed my sunny table and the gentleman who took my order was kind and helpful. I assumed he was the owner. Under $10... What a delicious deal."}
{"text":"I make Asian food at home frequently and I eat out too much. I never tire of Vietnamese or Chinese food. Curry in a Box is somewhat \"plain\" but is reasonably priced, quickly served and we'll prepared. The restaurant is very clean with plenty of natural light.  Sometimes you just crave the basics. Curry in a Box was just what I wanted.   Give it a try"}
{"text":"I came here when they first opened for takeout. I was very disappointed in their service as it took 30 minutes for my food to come out (even though the restaurant seemed empty). So when I came here a second time for takeout I was very happy to see that their service has improved a lot! My food only took 5-10 minutes this time - Yay!  I've now had the Volcano Chicken and the Panang Curry with Tofu. Out of those two the Panang Curry was definitely my favorite. The sauce that came with the Volcano Chicken was too sweet for me, however the Panang sauce had just the right amount of heat/sweetness. All of the veggies and proteins are cooked very well, my favorite is definitely the sweet potatoes mixed in. I also ordered 2 Crab Rangoons on my last visit. They were okay, not the best I've ever had but I would order them again.  For quick and fairly cheap thai food, this place hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Really really wanted to like this place but yet again the food has failed ! Decided to give this place a second try and ordered envy green curry (the menu stated it was spicy) and that's what I was in mood for. Food was super salty and has no spice to it.. I could barely finish it. I hate writing negative reviews but this was awful. Last time I had ordered chicken tika masala and it was less than average. The pro: cute place and friendly service.  Con: if ur in mood for spicy skip this place.. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"I ordered vegetable mixed curry with tofu and Iced Thai tea for $12.86, and waited for 27min! but the food was good though. Actually I can't distinguish different kinds of curry. But like the curry I had. May come back again. Order and pay first at and sit and wait for food."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this place for about a year now. I love almost everything on the menu. The veggie curry, pad ke mao, pad thai, chicken karee are some of my favorites.  For appetizers, I would recommend the summer rolls and the steam pork buns."}
{"text":"We tried Curry In the Box for a late lunch on Sunday. We've driven by this place dozens of times and commented that we should try it. I like the name, I think it's distinctive, but I had pretty low expectations. My partner had heard it was fast-food Thai and we weren't expecting much. It's also on University, so getting there can be a pain depending on traffic.  The woman at the counter was ready to take our order but we needed to peruse the menu on the wall first. I ordered the Envy Green Curry which claimed it was very Spicy. My partner got the Japanese Pan Curry - little spicy. When I paid via credit card it asked how much I wanted to tip: 15%, 20%, 25% or custom. I'm not sure on the etiquette of tipping when you order at the counter. Other than ordering my food, there'd been zero interaction. After paying, I was given a number and told they would bring it out when it was ready.  The space is open with lots of room between seats. We sat at a table near the counter and I attempted and failed to pick up the wifi from the Starbucks next door. We waited for our meals to arrive.  I was very pleased with the flavors and texture of my curry. Creamy, smooth, currytastic. It was delicious. I would have described it as a little to medium spicy rather than very spicy, but I still thought it was some of the best curry I have had in a long time. It was loaded with bamboo shoots and carrots as well as peapods, bok choy and basil and was served with a small bowl of perfectly cooked nutty brown rice. My partner's curry was just as creamy and delicious though even milder. It came with a breaded and fried chicken breast as well as a full bowl of potatoes.  I don't love the location and I'm still unsure of the tipping, but I seriously loved the curry. I would definitely like to go back and try the other varieties."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my favorite places to go for curry even if a person doesn't like spicy things it's still good. From what I remember of my Japanese grandma making curry a couple times or when my mom used to make curry off of her recipe this is likely more Japanese style curry than Indian or Thai. Has a lot more sweeter flavors a lot more emphasis on the flavor of spices vs hotness factor. You're going here looking for your next sriracha buzz maybe look for somewhere else this place just has really delicious food. I really recommend one of the peanut curry dishes such as the peanut noodle which my girlfriend always gets. They have some pretty good dessert too the coconut custard is a must-have don't be off put by the color of the custard it is amazing and delicious. Their chai tea is pretty decent too sweet somewhat milky and perfectly spiced. I've had the masala and beef curry the sweet potato curry most of their peanut curries and can say from what I've had I have no complaints. Portion sizes are adequate even on an empty stomach. It's one of those restaurants for you order, pay  and then sit down so if you're in more of a hurry you don't have to worry about waiting for the waiter to come for your check."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend not ordering food from this place unless you're okay waiting an hour and a half for cold half-ass cuisine this place is outrageously expensive for delivery and the food is far from mediocre"}
{"text":"Eh. It's ok. It's not very well spiced, a little bland.  I will say, though, that for the lunch prices, it's not a bad choice."}
{"text":"I've ordered here a few times the last time I ordered the food took and hour and a half literally from the time of ordering with no discount or apology so i figured busy night give them another try well tonight was utterly disgusting i ordered a mango lassi well tonight I assuming they thought well let's pour some more salt I was left with a nice plump fly right on top of the drink I'm now questioning the entire meal and stopped eating halfway through will be demanding refund"}
{"text":"I will definitely be adding this place to my \"quick, close, and tasty\" lunchtime rotation! Everything we tried was great! I had the chicken pad Thai with an egg roll and tried my cousins' chicken peanut special. Both were hot, fresh, and tasty! The egg roll was crispy all the way through and not too greasy. The sauces are thin but delicious! The portions are generous and the cost is competitive. The employees were friendly and the restaurant was clean. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. Seriously. I crave it.   The chicken and sweet potato curry is outstanding. I like to order it for takeout and make two meals out of it. Now that I'm writing this review, I think I'm going to order it for dinner tonight...  It's an interesting place because it's sort of like a Noodles & Co or Panera where the menu and posters and signs around the restaurant are very professionally done and they've clearly engaged with a professional firm to create and promote their brand. It's different from most Asian restaurants I visit (like the one across the street that used to be a coffee shop and still has coffee wallpaper but is now a Chinese restaurant). They are clearly building a brand with their two Madison locations, and I can easily see them expanding well beyond this in the coming years.  I found the ingredients to be fresh and high quality and the service to be fast enough to still be considered fast food, but slow enough to know that someone is actually making it to order.   Although it is counter service, everyone I've talked to there has been friendly and helpful. Definitely a winner for good curry comfort food."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved nearby and this is the perfect place for takeout, but we've eaten in both times we've gone. The interior is much larger and nicer than expected from the outside.   We've now had Jungle Curry, Pineapple Curry, Pad Thai, and Chicken Tikka. All the dishes have been great. The lunch menu is priced right ($5.50 instead of $8.50) without seeming too small.  Others have mentioned that the staff is nice and we agree. They also have a loyalty program that will give us discounts to a place we'd be going to anyway, which is ideal."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's fast, reliable, kid friendly and the food is delicious. The sweet potato curry is a favorite of mine. Honestly, I think the curry is better than what we've had at more \"genuine\" Indian places in Fitchburg/Madison."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Both times the food is amazing!  Highly recommend the squash curry with chicken in red sauce.  You order at the counter and they deliver to table.  Healthy fast food!! Friendly staff.  Clean with booths or tables."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: Food was great & quickly delivered, Staff was friendly, Decor was pleasant & clean, we'd both order our meals again  The Husband had Pad Thai \"it was good\" & I had Sweet Potato Curry with Chicken, really good from me! We split Crab Rangoon & Spring Rolls, very nice. Taking our extras home for lunch later. I'm new to this cuisine, but had a great first experience here. We were here for dinner, Friday night, and it was nearly vacant. We were told it has a hopping lunch business, so come for dinner & let's keep this yummy place in business!! Forgot to mention, the delivery folks were coming & going at a steady pace, I hope we live in their delivery area!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for quite a long time. I've read great reviews about this place. We dropped the kid off at a place near Fitchburg and decided to check it out. We weren't disgusted, but we weren't pleased, either. It's hard to decide what to actually give this place.   Thai is my favorite food in the world and I'm a pretty harsh critic. We ordered a couple appetizers so we could get a full sense of this place. The first one I tried was the samosa. It tasted like a potato pop tart. I realize samosas are made with potatoes - a lot of potatoes, but usually you can taste spice or some kind of flavor in them! These were not flavorful. Next, I tried my husband's egg roll. It was doughy. The kind you get in an elementary school lunch line. My husband also ordered a paratha. That was pretty good, but could have been cooked a bit more.   My husband ordered Panang Curry. This is probably his favorite dish at a Thai restaurant. It was much better than the appetizers, but seemed \"Americanized\" by being way less spicy than it normally is. I tried a Red Curry dish. It definitely had more spice, but wasn't up as spicy as it claimed. I really liked the flavor, but again, it wasn't the best I've ever had. The dishes both left us wanting.   Unfortunately, we will not be dining here, again."}
{"text":"Great food quickly. It is a go to for us whether delivery or pickup and is outside the box from your typical pizza, subs or Chinese delivery."}
{"text":"A place with express delivery service! On a snowy day food served hot in 20 odd minutes is nothing short of a miracle. The Penang curry with the Tofu (it was nice and tender) was really tasty. 3 was the right amount of spice. It was pleasing for the palette as well as for the eyes! Being a peanut lover the Peanut sauce did not fail to impress me. All in all a good experience. Would like to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night as part of a large vegetarian MeetUp group, so we were served a good selection of items from the menu. My personal favorites were the Tom Kha soup with tofu, the sweet potato curry and the squash curry. The sticky rice with banana dessert is just the right amount of sweetness at the end. Everyone at my table was very happy. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The Sweet Potato Curry with tofu (substituted for chicken) was a wonderful post-workout meal. The sauce was rich and flavorful (you decide the level of spice) with plenty of vegetables. I've eaten at the Fitchburg location several times, so I was overjoyed to see them open in my neighborhood. The space is quiet and comfortable with a mix of booths and tables. Place your order at the counter and they bring your meal to your table."}
{"text":"Quick and easy restaurant. The menu is on the wall and you order before you sit. The smell is great and I was pretty excited.   I concur with some of the other reviews that it is a bit pricey for lunch, but they do have a specials menu. I'll have to check that out next time.   Anyway, the masaman curry with beef and potatoes was very good and quite a decent sized portion.   Overall worth a shot if you're in the Madison burbs."}
{"text":"I've been going here since it opened and it's always been amazing.  It's great to see it grow from a small one-family show to two locations, an expanded first location, and a larger staff.  This place is second only to Ha Long Bay, and I think their red curries are about the same.  The family who owns it is really sweet, too."}
{"text":"I had the Tom kha soup, it was delicious!  Everything we got was soo good!  The fresh vegetable rolls with the plum, peanut sauce were amazing"}
{"text":"Tried their chicken tikka masala and was disappointed in the lack of flavor. Only received one piece of the bread option that isn't nan. Disappointed in a $20+ meal. I did use delivery so maybe that contributed."}
{"text":"Ok so this place sells Indian food too but don't fall for that. I ordered a panang curry with chicken and samosa to fill my minimum order criteria. The samosas were like a version of empanadas and didn't do justice to the world popular snack of my motherland. The panang curry was about average, didn't have too much depth in flavors. It was full of sweet potato and carrots which gave it way too much sweetness. The one thing good was their delivery, it was accurate and speedy."}
{"text":"This may sound crazy, but I never had a curry until maybe 2 or 3 years ago. I was raised in one of those meat and potatoes Wisconsin families, and to this day my mother still thinks the mildest of salsas is too hot.  Thankfully I married a guy who opened the world of Asian cuisine to me!  I am truly glad there is a place like curry in the box. I love the idea of somewhere quick, healthy, veggie friendly, that is also reasonably priced. I love Indian food, but sometimes I don't want to sit down for a whole big meal. This restaurant really gives you the best of both worlds!  My personal fave is the Masaman. Perfectly cooked tofu and potatoes in the most addictive curry sauce I've ever had! I'm hooked!  Fast, delicious, and a step above the usual casual dining, Curry in the Box is a solid bet!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars because my meal was take out and still tasted like I was in a five star restaurant. The flavors were bright and fresh. I had the cucumber salad which was divine. The Tom Kha soup danced on my tongue with lime and coconut. This is a must have. I also had vegetable fried rice which somehow felt light and airy instead of heavy and greasy like other places. Had to have a Thai iced tea and i was not disappointed. I will be back every time I travel to Madison."}
{"text":"Ok. Pretty blend for my taste."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick curry - green curry and a butternut squash and we were very pleased.  We ordered with no rice, so I think the portions were a little small without the rice - but we didn't want the carbs and the curry dishes were great as is.  If I went back I might try to order with double meat to bulk up on the protein and meal size.  The flavor was fantastic and definitely would go back to try more of the curry varieties.  One star deducted for the ambiance, decor, and overall vibe of the place.  That part felt more like a fast food place...."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because I was craving curry. Ordered it to go. They were fast and friendly. The inside reminds me of a Noodles & Company. And the moment of truth...the curry was so tasty!!! I ordered the chicken karee. I will most definitely be back here to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give them 1 star is because of how quickly the food was ready and the flavor. I ordered the chicken karee with medium spice. Good thing about it is the flavor and portion-the bad thing is that it was mostly potatoes and onions with slivers of chicken. I'm not lying-there was less than half of a chicken breast in my meal and they were sliced VERY thin.   I'm not very pleased that I just paid $10 for it BUT it tastes really good so I'm just a little sad. Curry in the Box-please step your chicken game up so that I can be happy and love you!   Worth it if you're craving good curry, not worth it if you want some chicken in your curry!"}
{"text":"I've been having an itch for Thai food that Madison hasn't been able to scratch. Having tried all the other Thai places in town I finally caved. Reading previous reviews, I knew it was wishful thinking but I was REALLY desperate.   My first impression walking in was that this was a noodles and more but the bootleg New York Chinatown knockoff. It's the same set up. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. It's the trendy \"fast casual\" concept. Was not trendy is the relatively expensive price tag. Each entree is no less than ten buck and you only get a ramen packet worth of noodles. Like if I didn't know better my entree was off of the kids menu.   I ordered the pad Thai (yes I know I'm a basic bitch) and it was pretty aweful. A weirdly sickly sweet yet sour at the same time cluster of undercooked noodles. It's almost like someone took sweet and sour sauce and mixed it with limes. And no the single teaspoon of peanuts and one sprig of cilantro don't impress anybody.   The only thing saving this from a one star review is that the food comes out quick and no tipping is required.   Do yourself a favor, if you're resigning yourself to crappy noodles just go across the street to noodles and more, at least they have a phone app to score a free appetizer..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai joints in Madison!  I've tried almost every curry on the menu but I tend to always make my way back to the Mixed Veggie Curry with Tofu (& no, I'm not a vegetarian).  The yellow curry is sweet with a hint of heat and the veggies are cooked perfectly - big hunks of broccoli, potato & carrots.  Grab a roti bread or 2 to sop up the extra sauce - so delish!  Add a side of the refreshing cucumber salad and you're good to go!  If you plan to be a frequent visitor to their Madison and/or Fitchburg locations, sign up for their rewards card.  I enjoy free birthday meals and regular $5 off coupons (which I obviously spend on the veggie curry)."}
{"text":"So excited they opened a second location in my neighborhood!  My go-to is the Mixed Veggie Curry with the warm roti bread.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried two different curries (panang and red curry) for lunch takeout. The curry is more watery than other curries I've had. Flavor was okay, but sadly nothing special. Roti was good and the portions were reasonable, so good value if nothing else."}
{"text":"The groupon got us in the door, but the peanut sauce will have us coming back.    While this is not my favorite Thai/Curry place, I do think they win out on a few choice menu items.  Faves being - Curry purses and the Satay.  I also love the use of sweet potato in the curries.  I was also able to ask for my dish to be a little more spicy, since 1 star was too tame on my first visit.  This is definitely a solid choice for eating and it is quite nice inside.  The food is great, but I found it a bit pricier than a curry competitor.  Maybe it's atmosphere that commands the higher ticket.  It's not outrageous, just a buck or two, here and there.  Solid choice for curry and the menu is dumbed down/Americanized for ease of use and ordering.    I will be a fan of this place, consistent food, decent price and good variety!"}
{"text":"Delicious curry and padthai! We had the chicken paneng, jungle curry, pad Thai and coconut rice! All were sooo yummy! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"We've only gotten take out from here.  Will have to dine in sometime to see if they rise to five.  The place is much larger than it appears from the outside.  Inside is decorated very nicely and it is exceptionally clean.  They have some nice benches available to sit while you wait for your take out and magazines are available.  It is cozy and a nice touch.  There is plenty of room inside  and I think we would really enjoy eating in some time.  They have a separate dinning area off to the side so they can seat quite a few people. The menu is straight forward and easy to order from. Our food was delicious and we were very happy with it. They really look like they are working at making this a successful restaurant and I for one would like to see a place like this stick around.   So try them out sometime.    They are sort of like a noodles and co but serve Thai and I would say they are better because of the depth of their menu and their atmosphere is a step up.    They are in an odd location and I think this hurts them.  We will be back. Went back.  We feel the portion size is a bit small for the price.  So be prepared for this.  ie, no leftovers which is maybe a good thing."}
{"text":"I was unimpressed by the food and the service.  There was no one in front of me when I entered.  The lady that was suppose to be the cashier was back chatting with another employee and it did not appear to be work related.  I waited a couple of minutes before she took my order, which is just irritating.  The food quality was okay, just not my tasted, but I am not heading back because of the service."}
{"text":"Called in for pick up, was told to come in 20 mins, showed up at the store, had to wait another half an hour in store. Also, they forgot to include utensils. At least they had my order right so I guess there's that."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. It's quick easy and I think the food tastes good! I've had the pannag curry and the squash curry. You can get either white or brown rice. Staff is very nice. Place seems clean. Check it out and decide for yourself but this is definitely a regular place I go on my lunch."}
{"text":"A strip mall mediocrity with bad recipes and skunky beer. Only highlight was the summer roll. To be avoided unless desperate.   Had the Penang Chicken Curry which had 6 small pieces of chicken and an overload of overcooked veggies including peas and carrots. Do they not know how to make this dish?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for a quick meal. You order at the front and then they'll bring food out to your table.   I would recommend ordering the roti. It's like a circular, crispy type of bread, and it really sets this place apart from other similar restaurants.   I'm a fan of Thai food and peanut butter, so I've ordered the panang curry and peanut delight. Both dishes have one of the best peanut sauces I've ever had, but the panang curry is spicier. The Rama chicken dish is similar, but doesn't have as many veggies."}
{"text":"Curry in the Box was recommended to me back in its Fitchburg infancy. The times I popped by the Box was not open. Since opening the Shorewood location, I've been a few times for dine in and carry out.  +flavorful, good quality ingredients  +lots of selections but not too big of a menu +white rice is perfect +decor is on point +quick assembly/prep (5 minutes from counter order to out the door during the dinner hour)  -Tikki Masala had 4 pieces of Asian style chicken. If it was 4 oz. I'd be surprised. My carry out container was mostly sauce. After adding the whole container of white rice to the sauce and eating every spoonful I was temporarily full. For $9 I've paid for more protein. Relying on the sauce/carbs to fill a person seems like penny pinching that ought not be. (And I'm a petite person with a \"bird like\" appetite, I've been told.) -I've come here after finding my fave area Asian restaurant is no longer at Hilldale. It would be nice if service was friendly or appreciative of my business. He who is welcoming wins!  All in all, worth giving a shot. Some room for improvement. Easy changes to be made for an increased rating. I wouldn't recommend it unless someone requested this specific cuisine in this neighborhood but I would consider going back again when hungry for fast Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Solid outpost of the Fitchburg restaurant.  Currently on a cleanse diet, I appreciated that their curry sauces are gluten-free and vegan.  I've been to Curry a few times and it's a great option in the \"fast casual\" space.  Order at the counter and meals are cooked to order.  I opted for the Lamb Curry and was impressed.  The marinated slow roasted lamb was tender and plentiful.  I ordered it spicy and the kitchen didn't hold back.  While not the best curry in Madison, Curry does it well, does it quick, and what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall. It seems like a small, cute little chain restaurant. We decided to grab takeout and ordered chicken pad thai and the masamang curry with tofu.  The chicken pad thai was very disappointing (not authentic at all) with a strong tomato flavor. If you don't think of the dish as pad thai, it's fine. I probably will not order this again though.  The curry portion was very decent. The flavor of the curry milk itself was very good and the zucchini in it and the tofu was very good. The rice was really dry and disappointing, but not a deal breaker.   Overall, I would stop by again for the reasonably priced curry for a quick meal. Nothing close to authentic Thai food, but I commend them for creating a fast-food model business."}
{"text":"(This review is for the new Curry in the Box on University, in the old Fuzzy's Taco Shop building, but it doesn't look like that location has a page yet.)  I'd never been here before today, but I'd had PHENOMENAL curry before at Ha Long Bay, so I was down to try something new. The space is still getting up and running, but it looks very good for the short turnaround they've had. My only, very minor, complaints were that service after we ordered was a bit slow, and my Volcano Chicken came with an overabundance of sweet & sour sauce (I dumped it into the bowl with the chicken and veggies, so a more even sauce/meat & veggie ratio would've been better). Also, something to note about the \"crispy chicken\" - if you're expecting the sort of \"crispy chicken\" you get with Chinese takeout, this is not it. It's still good chicken, but it's breaded, not fried in the same way you might be expecting.  Other than those little things, everything was great. The crab rangoon was my favorite - really delicious, and it looked lovely too. My friend's Peanut Delight was awesome, and had a much better sauce/meat ratio. Will definitely come back sometime."}
{"text":"Two stars for a wide selection and offering delivery service to my area.  Portions are a bit small and quality a little blah for the price.  Also, my experience with their fried food has been hit-or-miss.  I had the best spring rolls on my first order.  Delicately crispy, not greasy--indicative of a skilled hand, the right oil temp and just the right amount of time in that oil.  Unfortunately, two subsequent orders resulted in the same soggy mess which one can get anywhere else in town.  I'll still use them for delivered food a couple of times a year--and on the off chance that the skilled fry cook returns--but really prefer to go elsewhere for my Indian, Thai and Chinese fix."}
{"text":"Fast service and delicious food. I had Panang Peanut Noodle...amazing. Good portion size and quick take out service."}
{"text":"With how good the reviews are, I thought I would be getting um, Thai food. It has a chain vibe, which immediately made me think \"nope... This is gonna be awful\" but it was too late to go somewhere else. The Phad Thai I had was cafeteria quality at best. Monotone flavor. No sprouts, onions, spice. I'm fairly certain they tossed some rice noodles with a sauce from a bottle and sprinkled chopped peanuts on top and threw on a sprig of cilantro. The crab rangoon looked and tasted like it came from the frozen food section of my local grocer... I seriously would have gotten more authentic Thai at Noodles & Company."}
{"text":"I would rank this as my 3rd favorite Thai food place in town.  Some favs: Panang Peanut Noodle- this one is pretty kick ass Sweet Potato Curry Squash Curry Tofu  Can't go wrong with any of those!  Another reason I love this place is that it's the closest Thai food place to my house. Proximity is key!  In case you want my ranking of south east Asian food in Madison, here you go, best to pretty good: 1. Bahn Thai 2. Ha Long Bay 3. Curry in the Box 3. Sala Thai 4. Sai Bai Thong 5. Lao Lang Xang  I would rank all of these places above 3 stars+, all varying levels of goodness."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday night and wasn't crowded. Technically, I guess this place counts as a fast food restaurant so they are really quick to get your order in and then out the door.  They have a fusion of all different types of curries and noodles.  Given the vast amount of variety here, it's hard for them to truly be authentic in any way. I had the pad thai here which was much too much tomato flavor. I would not recommend getting that here. The curry I had was really delicious. Definitely worth it for the price.  In summary, stop by if you are in a hurry and would like some cheap good curry. Do not get the noodles! Don't expect authentic Asian cuisine but do expect some overall good food!"}
{"text":"The new Univeristy Ave. location is fantastic. Perhaps even better than the original Fitchburg location.   We ordered a Steamed Pork Bun, Sweet Potato Curry Chicken, and Khao Soi Noodle Chicken.   The standout was the Khao Soi Noodle Chicken. It has a wonderful yellow curry sauce with chicken, carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, noodles. The curry sauce is so good it's suitable to just eat with a spoon like soup. The noodles in this such worked well - I think even preferable to the same sort of dish with rice. This dish and the University Ave. location are going to be my new Westside Thai go to joint. Well let's be honest, the Westside has been craving a good Thai joint and now we have one.   Companion said her Sweet Potato Curry was \"...tasty!\"  My pork bun was fantastic. Steamed Buns - yes I said steamed buns cans be overly sweet - but this one was really very savory. Most satisfying steamed bun I've had in a long time. I also had a Thai Iced Tea - comets serviceable.   You order at the counter and within minutes your food arrives steaming hot. The total bill for our meal was a under $25 - a bargain. Eat locally - Eat at Curry in the Box!"}
{"text":"Waited about 25-30 minutes for our food to come after having about two wrong orders come to our table. When the correct order actually came the food was very hot and delicious. This place needs to learn how to manage a lunch time crowd (wasn't even that large of a crowd) and it would get four or five stars."}
{"text":"Great spot. Just opened on University-- I frequented the spot on Fitch Hatchery for quite a while prior. They do a great job with the basics of Indian and Thai without being overpriced, and with portions that are reasonable."}
{"text":"I live too close to Curry in Box to have only just recently been here.  I was here recently and am definitely looking forward to going back.  When I walked in I was initially surprised at how big it was and how friendly the host was.  My first request was directions to the restroom, long day, and the host graciously showed me the way.  On my way to the bathroom not to be too dramatic but I was hit by the most aromatic smells I have ever smelled; what a great start!  The menu is vast and the host/cashier patiently and thoroughly answered all the questions that I had and even offered some suggestions.  The menu is very organized and it is easy to narrow down what you want by spiciness, meat and sauce.  I finally settled on the squash curry but it was definitely hard not to get the sweet potato curry because that sounded amazing too!  I got the home and immediately dove into my food!  The curry was simply amazing and the rice was cooked perfectly.  I do have a couple of qualms about the food however.  I could have done with a lot more curry for my dollar.   The food was delicious but the portion size is definitely on the small side.  I also could have done with a bit more chicken in the curry as well.  With that said however I still feel comfortable giving this place 4 stars because the curry itself was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I am looking forward to trying many other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"For a quick lunch with a casual atmosphere this place is spot on.  I've only been there once so far but the Chicken Curry was awesome!  I will definitely be back since it's near my new office. I'm pumped to find this place!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for an early take-out lunch. I ordered the red curry with chicken, and loved it! Spicy but not overpowering, perfect vegetables, perfect rice. Enough to have a bit of leftovers for lunch the next day, too. I would love to try dining in next time...definitely plan on being back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for the first time today, and I'll definitely be back! I enjoyed the Green Envy Curry very much. The carnivore in me thought it could have had a little more meat (though the chicken was very good). However, the veggies were fantastic! No semblance of previously frozen, uniform vegetables here! The whole dish was really great - nice and spicy! When I ordered, I didn't get asked about spice level, but I'm guessing you could ask for more or less? Attractive presentation; it seemed less heavy on the rice (which I guess is a good thing). Nice place, great food, quick service, and very affordable. Yep, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Solid! Not bad, not excellent, but solid.  We got delivery last night and chose Curry in the Box because I'd heard they have some good vegan options. We ordered the squash curry and the vegetarian chana masala and an order of the veggie summer rolls. The delivery was pretty quick and the food arrived hot.  The summer rolls were pretty flavorless and needed to be smothered in sauce to cover up the taste of plain lettuce. The curry and chana masala were both tasty, but the portions were on the small size considering their price. I liked that you had the option of brown or white rice, which is a big plus in my book.  Overall, the food was tasty, but nothing extraordinary for me and I think I might test out other comparable options next time."}
{"text":"Really great curry! Going here for lunch means fighting the rush and that can mean a wait but well worth it. The green curry & bamboo is delicious, I'd highly recommend it! The atmosphere is decent for being in a small strip mall but the service is what makes up for it as the staff is very nice!  The lunch menu is usually the way to go as it's cheaper than the regular menu. And the portions are usually smaller, unless you love jasmine rice, then order away carb freaks!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff- fast and casual.  I can't say it's authentic Thai, but it's good, and the 3-star spicy dishes are nice and spicy.  Much better than Sa-Bai Thong, not as good as Suwanasak (which is neither fast nor all that great for dine-in).  The chicken wrap on the kid's menu is \"normal\" enough that my picky kid loved it, and the dishes described as not spicy were not spicy like my wife likes."}
{"text":"I ordered a meal for pick up, and it was ready to go when I arrived. The curry I got was great, and a very good price. Traveled well to my next destination."}
{"text":"The paratha was good.  We were the only ones there and the rice was overdone and starchy.   The chicken tikka was my least favorite chicken tikka I have ever had. Along with my partner's lamb dish, there was very very little meat. The spices were way off, it was far more liquidy than I enjoy. It wasn't the creamy, warm, comforting feeling I get when I eat Maharani's chicken tikka, this was some thin pieces of chicken in a greasy, kind of tomatoy, odd spiced mess.   I was going to give this place two stars but the hair I got in my chicken tikka and the hair my partner got in his lamb masala made me think it over."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have a nice size menus with a variety of options. Nothing is more than $8.95 regardless of what entire you get. I love the chicken karee which is a yellow curry sauce with chicken breast, cashews, cilantro, onions and potatoes served with a nice size portion of rice. Add the roti bread with it for $1. Great satisfying meal. As I have read comments regarding portion sizes, I must disagree. It's curry. You do not want to over due it. I feel they give you good size portions. Everything is made to order so the food comes piping hot. My sauce has always been the right thickness. My only issue is I think the roti bread should come with the meals and not be added on. But it's worth the extra $1. Amazing bread. Highly recommended place. Even for vegetarians and vegans."}
{"text":"I will be so sad to leave Madison soon and one of the reasons is because I won't get to eat Curry in the Box anymore.  It is a great place to grab thai food to-go.  I recommend trying all of their curry dishes (Sweet Potato Curry is the best!). They also have brown rice, which is a plus!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Sure it's cheap, sure it's fast and yes it tastes like both.  It's a glorified form of fast food.  We did have lamb vindaloo which was good and kept the two star rating.   Overall, why get this when you can have Ha Long Bay!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for curry ever. Ever. The jungle tofu curry is probably my most ordered dish but I also love the squash curry and panang curry. The roti is also out of this world. The service is usually good with fairly limited interaction between you and the cashier. I have only had a couple of instances where I was given white rice instead of brown rice or where the staff was a little less friendly but overall this is a phenomenal place for quick curry."}
{"text":"How does this place only have 2 reviews?  The food and price is just too good for this place not to have some more hype.  It was always empty whenever I went, which was often.  The chicken tikka masala is surprisingly good (given that it has a more thai focus) and spicy (you get to choose the spice level).  The green curry is also good.  The amount of food you get for the price is great....all take out comes with a large stuffed box of rice and a generous portion.  One dish could probably fill two people, or give one person delicious leftovers.    Only 4 stars because it never really \"wowed\" me.  But you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and while there is nothing terrible about the food, the flavors were only reminiscent of a masala and Tom Kha soup. The soup wasn't even actually a soup but more like rice noodles with sauce."}
{"text":"Despite sporting a name befitting a West Towne food court stand, Curry in the Box is rapidly becoming my favorite South Madison lunch haunt.  With clean flavors, a lunch menu loaded with affordable options and an efficient kitchen that churns out my meal in less than 10 minutes, there a lot to love about this strip mall outpost on Fish Hatchery Road.  I dined in during my first visit to Curry in the Box.  The menu is posted on the wall as you enter the restaurant.  A floor display lists a set of nine lunch specials, affordably priced from $6.29 to $7.49. I ordered the Chicken Kapow (Chicken breast, bamboo shoots, onion, mushroom, and basil stir fried in fresh chili sauce) for $6.29, paid the cashier, picked my number and found a table in the surprisingly large, well-lit dining area.  Five minutes later, a smiling server delivered by meal, served in a large white bowl.  While Chicken Kapow is a standard Thai dish, the kitchen showed a great deal of skill in preparing this dish, stir-frying the vegetables to coax a mouthful of flavor in every bite.  The cooks applied the chili sauce with gentle hand, using the sauce to complement the other ingredients, not overwhelm them.  My only gripe was with the rice, far too gummy for my preferences.  The following day, I ordered the Japanese Pan Curry (crispy chicken breast with diced potato in a yellow curry sauce) as takeout.  While the double starch combo of cubed potatoes and rice seemed redundant, the dish delivered clean flavors and just enough heat to warm my bones on a frigid early January afternoon.  I felt the serving size provided great value for the $7.49 I paid for this meal.  Though not my overall favorite Asian restaurant, Curry in the Box will be a frequent lunchtime destination where I can procure great a well-prepared meal in less than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"At first, I was a little wary of the menu..I couldn't quite figure out if the restaurant was thai..or indian..thai..or indian...and that was a little worrisome to me. Personally, I think those two cuisines are way too different to be served together, but given that there weren't many other dining choices in the area, we decided to give it a shot.   I ordered a yellow curry rice dish while my mom ordered a yellow curry noodle dish. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the authenticity of the curry. The ingredients were fresh. The curry was creamy and the perfect consistency to spoon over my rice. It really hit the spot!   The service was fast and super friendly, but it was kind of strange how they did not bother to bus tables more quickly. (Our table selection was limited to the three tables that did NOT have dirty dishes on it).   Probably won't be back anytime soon, but good to know that there is a decent Thai restaurant around!"}
{"text":"Update:  I ordered the food in house tonight, and still didn't prefer the food over so many others in Madison. It definitely tasted more fresh, at least, than getting delivery. I don't recommend ordering delivery if you want to at least give this place a chance on showing their quality.   I added a star for their nice customer service and clean dining area, though.       The wait for this delivery was over an hour, and my friends ordered curry dishes as well. Everything costs around $10 a plate with delivery charge and tip.   The pad thai tasted okay, nothing great, definitely not as good as other pad thai dishes. My friends curry tasted way too sweet to me. I'm guessing it's because no one made their dishes spicier than the \"as is\" level. But if that's their standard sweetness level, I'm gonna opt out of it.  I dunno, I wish I'd had a better experience. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"I love love love Curry in the Box....one of my favorite lunch places in this area...  a really nice selection of dishes, great ranges in flavor, food is light yet, substantial  yummy yum yum...I want  hint:  they are BEEZAY at lunch....get there early or plan to wait a bit.  they make each dish to order so...you have to wait for them to actually cook your food.  what a keerazee idea!  :P"}
{"text":"Bland and generic food that doesn't really make me think of thai cuisine. I can't think of a reason to ever go back. That being said if you are in the mood for something that has vaguely asian flavors at an average price point, in a normal amount of time, this place is passable."}
{"text":"It's decent.   I am a pretty basic Indian/Thai cuisine fan, I normally just order a chicken tikka misala (which is exactly what I had today). My order was to go, I rode the bus for about 15 minutes back to campus and the food was still hot! Which is a major plus for me, I hate cold food. There's an up charge for brown rice but it's only about .50. The food was good, wasn't too spicy at all. I definitely recommend for anyone looking to try Thai/Indian cuisine on a budget."}
{"text":"I'm a big Indian fan and so when Curry in the Box opened up I was excited to have another option -- and especially one that had Thai options (which is my wife's favorite).   Their cost per dish was average but trying different things added up and I wound up spending close to what I would've if I had gone to a place that wasn't \"fast food\"-y.  I think in their drive to do a little of Column A and a little of Column B with their menu they wound up falling a little short in execution.  I think the best way I can describe it is that it is white-washed Indian and Thai. It's not bad, but it didn't scratch the itch I get when I crave Indian, nor for my wife when she craves Thai.  With the wide array of options for actual Indian or Thai in the area I don't know expect that is enough to bring us back."}
{"text":"Don't skip over this place, it's surprisingly good. You're definitely not going to get the best curry you've ever had here, but for its vast menu and prices, it's definitely superb. I personally recommend the Japanese pan curry. The chicken beats many \"chicken only\" establishments."}
{"text":"Love the pangang curry! I'm so glad I live just around the corner. We order it so often that I programmed their number into my phone. Food is always quick, ample portions, and delicious."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the chicken tikka masala. The sauce was very soupy and not very flavorful; it tasted nothing like masala. The rice and quality of the chicken were average. Overall: overpriced and underwhelming."}
{"text":"I used the Yelp ordering to get lunch.  I ordered the Karee with Chicken.  It had the right spice level and everything tasted good.  The jasmine rice was cooked well.  The chicken was a bit tough but I have teeth so I was okay with it.  Delivery was fast and efficient.  I would have lunch with them again."}
{"text":"Four stars for the food, and a fifth star for recieving delivery from a really cute delivery guy. Moved into a new apartment and am so happy we chose to have our first meal delivered by Curry in a box. The envy green curry was especially delicious! I can't wait to have it again!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food for a reasonable price. I had the Penang curry noodles with chicken and was very satisfied with the flavors and quality."}
{"text":"Very tasty!  This is the first time I've been to curry in a box and I have to say that it was pretty yummy.  After checking out the many different options on the menu I went with the panang chicken curry.  It had zucchini, squash, chicken, carrots and peas with a little kick of a curry sauce added in. Lunch date had the peanut delight which was very good also but too much peanut for me.  It was good to switch off from one to the other when the panang got a little spicy.  The service was extremely quick and the food came out piping hot! ( be careful if you are too excited like I was) The dishes were accompanied by a bowl of white rice that was cooked to perfection.  One thing that kind of sucked was the parking. But well worth it to wait for an open spot :)"}
{"text":"Prices are great, portions are perfect and you can't beat the deal.  Little place tucked in.  The sign is very small, so if you don't know what/where your looking, you will miss it.  The atmosphere is nothing special, but it is comfortable and well spread out.   The staff is pleasing, polite, and professional.  I recommend this place for a quick bit or take out."}
{"text":"Tried the Japanese Pan Chicken for lunch.  Awesome choice of a curry dish for a beginner.   This was Julie's 1st taste.  She had Peanut Delight and loved it.  Don't be afraid,  stop in and try it."}
{"text":"I've had a few bad experiences here but decided to give it another try since they are under new management. So far everything has been delicious and no charred pan residue."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite curry places in Madison! Do not be fooled by the name; they are far from your normal take-out restaurants. My personal favorite is the Japanese Pan Curry. It is a yellow curry topped with a crispy fried chicken breast. I repeat, CRISPY FRIED. They serve healthy portions, and the atmosphere is always welcoming. ProTip: be careful with their star designations for their spice levels. If you're the adventurous type, be conservative and start at two stars."}
{"text":"The first few times I went here, I wasn't very impressed by the flavors. However, it turns out that with curry, you really just need to find the type best suited for your taste! I've since discovered their Yummy Green Bean dish with red curry, and it is AMAZING. Not only that, but the fresh steamed pork buns they serve are out of this world. Only downside is that sometimes by dinner they are sold out of them, but I guess that's a good thing, since they're so delicious and everyone loves them!  We've also started trying out their Aladdin's Noodle menu in the evenings, and it's just as delicious. They house soy sauce noodles with chicken was amazing. If you haven't tried this place out, you really need to do so! I've branched out on many of their many other menu offerings (their robust wonton soup is PERFECT on a cold day), and have found many other favorites.  Their new remodel of the restaurant really freshened things up! One of the area's best curry hot spots!"}
{"text":"I MUST tell the world about how delicious Curry in the Box is. Everything about my visit was exceptional and I've recommended it to a few friends already.  They have a bit of an advantage in that I love Thai food, but what I wasn't expecting was how much I would love a dish that wasn't Pad Thai.  I got the Pineapple Curry to go and asked if it could be less spicy (was listed as a 2 pepper spicy rating). The cashier said they could add some extra pineapple juice to the sauce and take care of it. Nice!  The food was so so good. My friend got the green curry with tofu and it was also excellent, albeit a little spicier.  We got our food within 10 minutes of ordering and both raved about it.  Nicely done! I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with Curry in the Box. We came here on a whim. It wasn't very full that evening, but service took a five-ever (that is more than forever).   I ordered the Tom Kha Noodle Soup, which is my current go-to Thai dish, with tofu. I was disappointed in my noodles. They were overcooked to the point of disintegration. They were either overcooked or cooked at one point then reheated.   Oh, do not order the cucumber salad with ground peanut for $2.99. They barely give you anything, and it is so overpriced. It is literally a couple slices of cucumber in rice vinegar (and I'm sure some other sauces) with a sprinkle of peanuts.   Perhaps I'll have better luck at the Fitchburg location."}
{"text":"Curry in the Box is a high 3 star for me.  I love that a place like this exists - essentially a fast food version of Indian food.  Similar to Qdoba and Chipotle, except they have a wider variety and don't quite make the food in front of you, but wait time isn't much longer and prices are comparable (under $10).  I ordered the Packer Green Chicken Curry lunch special, a soda, and Roti Paratha bread.  The food was quite tasty even if lacking in presentation, and I appreciate that it comes with rice.  Portion size was a bit on the small side, but thankfully the dish I ordered was pretty filling so it seemed like less of a problem.  It had those addictive properties that most curries have, and I would easily come back for it just like so many of us do for Chipotle burritos.  The staff was friendly and helped steer me in the right direction for my dish.  He was familiar with his product and gave me some alternatives when I wasn't interested in his first suggestion.  Would like to see a few more condiments aside from Sriracha (soy sauce at the least), and a little more flair to the dishes, but otherwise this is an enjoyable lunch stop that won't break the wallet.  I'm sure a review update will be coming sooner rather than later on this one as I really want to see how their Chicken Tikka holds up"}
{"text":"My dad and I went here for lunch and were very impressed with how fresh the veggies were. I liked the flavors. The only cons to me were that we were the only people in the restaurant and the food was a little watery. But overall good experience"}
{"text":"What's in a name? Apparently everything! I mean the Thai food here is like it all came from a nice boxed kit. Something about the food just doesn't taste authentic, and I feel like it hasn't had time to develop any flavor; like the ingredients were just de-thawed and thrown together. You know what I'm talking about - a microwaved can of soup just doesn't compare to one that is homemade and has stewed in the crock pot for several hours. This place is just fine, but I would only go here for convenience as there are better Thai options in the area."}
{"text":"Yummy! We ordered peanut sauce veggies and noodles. Both dishes were amazing and I was tempted to take some home.  Their mango lassi is more than mango shake but really delicious. Will visit again soon"}
{"text":"Curry in the box is a cheap Thai place for college students to take to their dorms and manned by college students.  I drove in around 7 PM and was surprised to find the parking lot that they share with Starbucks, completely full. So I parked on a side street and made my way in assuming the place to be packed.  There was only one other person seated in the restaurant!   Anyway you have to walk up to the counter to order and pay for your food first. The cost of a curry and rice is around $10. The kid behind the counter then asks for the tip amount to be added to the bill. This is even before any service has been provided and before I have my food.   There was some spilt food on the floor at the first table I approached. While I moved to the next table, the mess didn't get cleaned in the 30 minutes I was at the place.   The food itself was average. The quantity of meat is limited. All in all - go here if you want a cheap meal or support students who are working for a living. If not, Hilldale mall and some great restaurants are just around the corner."}
{"text":"This is a frequent place for my coworkers and me. The meals are excellent for the price and there are always tables available so there's no waiting around.   They also deliver."}
{"text":"Very very poor in quality. Wanted to order Chana Masala ( have it on their Menu ) but they mentioned it is no longer available,  so they suggested TOFU instead chickpeas and it was totally poor in quality.  ROTI ( paratha) was not made fresh, I guess they used frozen Malaysian paratha or something like that . I would like to give 0 star to this place.  I suggest to go for other Indian restaurant instead. This one is total waste of money."}
