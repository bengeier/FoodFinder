Tip: you can substitute soup for the egg roll in the combination dinners."}

{"text":"There is one prior review, and frankly, I don't have much to add. Honey Moon has been in Irwin for (I'm guessing) about 6 years. 

The food is good and the portions are decent, but it's nothing extraordinary. Prices are reasonable. There are several Chinese restaurants in the Irwin area, and this one is conveniently located on Clay Pike. There are only a handful of tables inside, so it's not really conducive for a sit-down meal. More of a take-out joint. My biggest issue is that they don't deliver, which would give them a heads up since I don't believe any of the other Chinese places deliver, especially since this isn't a sit-down place."}
