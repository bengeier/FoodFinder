{"text":"I've been going to Serranos since a was a kid.  It's my favorite Mexican restaurant in Az.  Food is always great, drinks are good, prices are fair and the staff is usually friendly.  The only downside is they're closed now on Sundays and there's not one by downtown Tempe (where I am)."}
{"text":"Terrible. Just terrible. There are many Mexican places to choose from. Don't waste your time at this one. Food is mediocre at best and the service is downright atrocious! We ordered 3 things for take-out and two of them were incorrect. When my husband called about it, the manager was awful. He raised his voice and would not admit any wrongdoing. Again, with so many delicious Mexican places around, don't waste a meal here."}
{"text":"Two words: BEAN DIP. That's the main reason to visit Serranos, but the rest of their food is great, too. You can't even compare Serranos to the rest of the big chain Mexican restaurants in town that serve generic food straight from cans. Blech.   I applaud the recent re-addition of the \"Pollo Rojo\" chicken dish, but unfortunately it is on the limited time only special menu. I really hope someone at Serranos reads this and brings it back permanently."}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant since I was a little kid! Always friendly service, excellent bean dip, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! Their food is good quality and the prices are pretty reasonable. If you want some good Mexican food and do not need a super fancy restaurant, give Serrano's a try!"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food.  We have been to several catered events here and are never disappointed"}
{"text":"A family favorite!  We've come here for 16 years and still love it.  We love the water pitchers on the table, the chips, dip and usually quick service."}
{"text":"Freshest bean and salsa dip out of any restaurant I have been to in my life. I know first hand, the bean dip and salsa are made fresh each morning, this makes a big difference.   The food is better than average but again I go for the chips and dip."}
{"text":"Probably the best salsa I've ever had has been right here. Consistent, hearty and very flavorful.   Love the mariachi when he's there...and Tammy is the best server EVER. The food here is authentic and robustly flavored. Most dishes, I've noticed, are notably spicier than other Mexican places I've been to. The spinach enchiladas with fundido sauce are incredible....the Margaritas, super yummy and never watered down.  This place is a MUST when we're in town. Love it, love it, love it."}
{"text":"We went here the other day for lunch. I have been here a few times, but unfortunately I felt I needed to write a review after this. The food has never been excellent, but decent enough to go back every once in a while. Kind of like a family staple when its like \"Where should we go?\" and after several \"I don't know's\" we would end up here because its decent and close to the house. I like their enchiladas. We were here on Tuesday. We ordered two cheese enchiladas and nachos. Let me put this out there, I LOVE CHEESE. SO much. For me to say there was too much cheese, it has to be really bad. My husbands nachos were so cheesy, there was literally puddles of grease on the plate. We were joking about what Gordon Ramsey would say about all the grease. He would have drained it in to a glass. We probably would have gotten a whole cup, no joke!  The chips were so soggy that they were not even able to be picked up, they would just break into mush. When he got down a little further, there was literally a 1/4 inch of cheese, cooked so much it had formed it's own plate, we were able to pick it up off the plate in one piece! We mentioned it to the waiter twice, he seemed completely unconcerned. On the third time we mentioned it, he said \"Well, its probably because of all that cheese\" and walked away and got our bill. Honestly, if he had just said sorry about that, or offered new ones, I would have been happy. The chips and salsa are good though (need to ask for the hot, the one they serve is just stewed tomatoes pretty much, but the hot is awesome)."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty much what you'd expect from a mexican restaruant but I like the fact that it is locally family owned. Service is good and prices are competitive. I work nearby and the lunch specials are very tasty and the service is quick."}
{"text":"Very good Food Here & the price is reasonable. Love the free bean dip & the chips & salsa!"}
{"text":"Chips are so fantastic!  I had the taco salad;( . Shell was bla-& soggy- dressing ( thumbs way down)husband liked his chimi- Order the appetizer dip( better than the award winning table dips) We will return if only to try something else!"}
{"text":"This is the greatest mexican restaurant we've ever been to.We try to go twice a month.My husband is not a fan of mexican food,but he Loves Serrano's.We were eating lunch there one day and a beautiful family was sitting near us and we could overhear what they were saying. I said \"excuse me,are you the owners\" they replied that they were the Serrano Family.They were so friendly.They were absolutely delightful! I told them that as a chef I am very critical of restaurants, and that theirs was a true jewel, from their food to their staff.Isaiah was our server,we love him so much that we try to get him every time we come in. The salsa and that unbelievable bean dip, well they are so good you could make a meal out of just those. I don't suggest that you do that, because you would miss one of the best meals you will ever have.As a matter of fact I think we will go this weekend."}
{"text":"Solid is right.  Some of the best casual MX food I have ever had.  My grandma lived not far from this place on Boston St and I have fond memories of eating many, many meals here every time we visited.  I reccommend to anyone who lives in the neighborhood and has yet to try or if your just visiting."}
{"text":"I like to come here with friends to catch up. The staff is always friendly, and will accommodate if we have a group of 10 or more. The last time I was here I got a chimichanga and ordered a nice golden margarita. Tasty. The bean dip and salsa always taste fresh too. I haven't been to any other Serrano's locations, but this one is my usual stomping ground for dinner, snacks, and conversation with friends."}
{"text":"This was the worst mexican food I've had in Arizona. I had the cilantro-lime grilled chicken which tasted liked burnt grilled chicken no lime flavor. I asked for cilantro lime sauce on the side and it was bottled lime juice with what looked like dried cilantro leaves... the sopapillas was good. The strawberry margarita cost $6.50 on happy hour special which tasted about how the strawberry lemonade taste. I then asked how much a shot of suava reposado cost to add he said $7. Never will eat here nor recommend to any one.."}
{"text":"8-2010  Update   The owner passed away and they have made a lot of changes for the worse.  Smaller portion sizes, higher prices.   Service is not as good as it used to be either.  I have stopped eating here."}
{"text":"We waited to be seated because two hosts were combining a table. Not a big deal but when it's 115 and your holding a baby carrier and the door keeps opening because people are coming in, then it would be nice to be seated.  Food was average, service was average. I remembered why we stopped coming here."}
{"text":"Went to this Serrano's on Friday, May 12th around 3:30 in the afternoon.  The Hostess sat us in the dining room and the bus boy gave us our chips and bean dip and left.  We waited 15 minutes and no one came to get our drink order so we had to flag down the hostess and ask her to have someone take our drink order. Finally someone came to get our drink order plus we asked for water.  We waited another 15 minutes before they came back with our drinks, they forgot the water.  They said they would be right back with the water. They never came back with the water or to take our order so after another 15 minutes we were so mad we left. We never did get the water after asking several times.  We tried to flag someone down to pay for our drinks but no one was around.  We did go up to the Hostess to pay for our drinks and she asked what was wrong and we told her. She apologized and told us not to worry about paying for the drinks they were on the house.  All we had was lemonade anyway! I will never ever go to this Serrano's again and I will tell all my friends and family not to  go there either!!!"}
{"text":"My dad, my brother, and I enjoyed a late lunch here last weekend while visiting with my dad in AZ.  I was very impressed in all areas.  The restaurant has a nice look and feel to it.  The waitress was friendly and polite.  The salsa they give you with the chips was outstanding.  The prices were very reasonable.  All the food I ate was delicious.  The bathrooms were nice and clean.  What more could I ask for?  Oh, I know.. I need to see if they have Serrano's in Northern California.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Our family loves great Mexican food and supporting local business. We enjoyed a delicious meal and were impressed with the friendly and polite service. John was our server and was helpful in choosing our entrees and was perceptive in pacing our meal--especially important when eating out with kids on a Saturday night. The staff attitude on the whole was cheerful and welcoming--something missing in many establishments these days. We'll be back. I'll also include a plug for the Serrano Family's neighboring restaurant, Brunchie's. Also delicious, friendly, great sized portions."}
{"text":"The big plus is that they always have menudo available. white or red!! I like the white a little better but switch around. The rellenos aren't so good and I've had one served with the chile hard and undercooked. The tamales and enchiladas are both ok. The menudo and salsa are worth a visit."}
{"text":"My wife ordered no lettuce,  I ordered no tomatoes and told the waiter I am allergic to fresh tomatoes.  The runner brought our food my wifes had lettuce on it, mine had tomatoes,  I told the runner about the allrgy, my plate came back they had scraped the tomatoes off so the juice was soaked in. I  had to wait another 20 minutes for my food. The Manager did comp mine but my wife was almost done eating by the time I got my food. The server was great,  I will not go back."}
{"text":"Dinner was fine but this is American Mexican food and nothing more. To expensive for the food you get. This is like going to Applebee's for a steak. it will do but that's it."}
{"text":"Great food and good service! Lunch service is much quicker than dinner though."}
{"text":"We were in Chandler for Arizona Train Days and decided to have a late lunch before heading home to Tucson. We went a few miles down the road and discovered Serrano's. The chips were freshly made and served with a spicy salsa and also bean dip. We judge Mexican food based on the chips and salsa. Muy bueno. I had cheese enchiladas and they were good.  I would go back just for the chips and salsa. The service was excellent that day too."}
{"text":"Food was good but service sucks 45min for dessert is outlandish wouldn't recommend it because of the slow service"}
{"text":"My first time dining at Serrano's.  Service was excellent.  Our Server was very attentive to our needs.  Chips are served not only with salsa but also a bean dip.  I had a bean and cheese burrito, enchilada style with rice and beans.  The food was good and was brought to our table quickly.  I was surprised not to find tacos listed as ala cart.  There are some interesting margaritas on the menu but didn't try any on this visit. They are \"kid friendly\".  Good Mexican food but nothing really special.  In fairness, I haven't tried enough of their menu.  Prices seem a little high compared to other similar restaurants.  Ample parking available on the street and side of restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the bean dip, and the Serrano spice. It's good and old style."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place for over a decade. The quality of the food has gone way downhill. It's really sad. The food was never 5 stars, but consistently 3-4 stars. Now the only thing good here is the bean dip. You may want to bring your own chips though, as theirs are super oily. The rest of the food is very greasy/oily too. I'm not sure what happened. I'll be back to have a beer and the free bean dip, but that's about it. I hope the quality goes back to what it was for years, so I can eat here again."}
{"text":"I love Serrano's food! Service can be a little slow sometimes, but overall we enjoy it. Try their machaca beef as well as their fried ice cream."}
{"text":"We tried dining here once before but the wait was too long, so this time we came a little earlier in the day (around 5pm) and were able to be seated right away. Now I understand the reason for the wait...because the food and service is great! Everything we ordered was delicious. I could've made a meal out of their complimentary (and generous amounts of) chips, salsa and hot bean dip...which, by the way, is ahhhhMAzing!   Will definitely be back for more :)"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Serrano's I had a great visit and meal. This time I did not. I ordered the Pollo Ranchero and thought it would be a yummy saucy dish with some spice. What I received was a piece of chicken breast that was baked then chopped and tossed with a little sauce that had no color. It was not a good meal. I could deal with that as it was my choice, but the server came to our table maybe two times. We had to ask the Bus boy for a to go box, our check.. and he even had to ring it up for us. I will try one more time and I hope its not like this again. I will let you know how it goes my fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"Mary was our server. She was fantastic.  Attentive, our water never ran out. Food was great."}
{"text":"Ah Serrano's. Been to the Serrano's on Guadalupe right next to Pink Pepper a bunch of times back in the day before they closed. It was in our lunch rotation at work for a while until somebody asked what the \"Mexican Delight\" on the specials menu was and the smart alecky gal in our group pointed at the balding and chubby Mexican dude in our group and yelled out \"He's the Mexican Delight!\" We watched in slow motion as the cute young waitress tried very hard to suppress laughter but it was a deep belly laugh and she had no way of winning. After she lost the battle she had apologized profusely for laughing at that and that ended up being the last time Mexican dude went out with us whenever smart alecky gal was going with us as well. Fast forward to December 2014 - we have a company gathering in one of the many banquet rooms at the Chandler Downtown Serrano's. I was quite familiar with the food and knew what to expect - standard hot plate gringo Mexican food that my parents would associate with Mexican food. No matter - I had the beef chimichangas, hard shell chicken tacos, flautas, and even jalapeno poppers. The running joke with the jalapeno poppers was that all the Mexican folks in our group thought they were chicken nuggets and only the non-Mexicans knew what they really were right away. Drinks were flowing as well as our company gave everyone 2 drink tickets. I had 2 gin and tonics with Tanqueray. They gave us all an extra round so I wanted the same thing but was informed they were all out of gin which I found unusual since they even asked which type of gin I preferred. Was there a freaking gin tasting event in the next banquet room or something? WTF! But I believe we all left happy with food and drink in our bellies as well as being entertained by the Jest Murder Mystery Company based in St. Louis. My rating is for this particular experience as I don't really frequent Serrano's anymore. Just south of the Arizona avenue and Boston Street intersection. Plenty of parking the night we went but might not be the case when some Chandler Downtown event is going on."}
{"text":"Meh. Fake tasteless Mexican food for the octogenarian crowd. Sooo disappointing after coming from the east coast and expecting some heat!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been a Chandler favorite for many years.  I really like their fresh salsa - it has just the right amount of \"bite\" to it.  Their bean dip is very good, and I like the sorta greasy and salty chips.  I prefer oily chips to the dry, flavorless chips that seem to be so common now that people are watching their fat intake.  Service has always been very good, and there is plenty of seating.  Prices are reasonable (about 7 bucks for the lunch special).  I would like to see lunch specials with coffee or tea included in the price - that would be over the top!"}
{"text":"Went here cause I've heard from a few people it was good. Being a huge fan of Mexican food, I had to check it out. Pretty nice happy hour special, half off appetizers. Very nice staff. Food was just ok. Queso dip was the consistency of water. Valle luna is still the best i've had. Manager was very helpful and eager to please, but the food was just ok."}
{"text":"I don't eat Mexican very much in Chandler, but when I do Serrano's is a great place on my list. Had the combo fajitas with chicken, meat and shrimp. What an awesome value for $21 for 2. We met friends here for dinner and they shared some enchiladas and we had 3 beers. Dinner was $ 52 for all us. It was such a great deal. The fajitas were delicious and hot and sizzling when presented. It came with 2 separate plates filed with good rice and beans and flour tortillas. Our server Silvia was so friendly and nice and took care of us so well. The bean dip people rave about is soooo good , we ran out and they brought us a refill with more chips. The have a hotter red salsa and one with cilantro and chopped tomatoes that is less spicy. This is a great family run restaurant and I would definitely return. Keep up the good work Serrano family. I raise my Dos XX Amber tall to you!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and never disappointed! The food is great and service is always fast and friendly!! The prices are extremely reasonable for huge portions! I can almost always get two meals out of my dinner!"}
{"text":"I used to like the food here they are friendly but since they changed the salsa and the chips are different amongst other things I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this restaurant I took my family here for a special occasio. The food and service was the worst. The fish was so overcooked or frozen and frost bit I couldn't eat it. The green chile on the cheese crisps with laid on top and not even cooked. I will not be recommending anyone to eat at this restaurant. Don't waste your time or money waiting in line he would be better off at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I had an awesome first visit here. I forget my waiters name but he was very kind and professional. The place was very calm and I enjoyed every bite of my food, especially the dessert!"}
{"text":"I have been away from Southern AZ for many years and in my heart it is still home. I live in New England now and the selection of quality Mexican restaurants is slim. While traveling to Phoenix this week for business, I had the pleasure of dining at Serrano's Mexican Food. It brought me back home. Its rustic homestyle Sonoran Mexican food and decor was what my spirit needed. I enjoyed the mini sample platter, a Carne Asada chimichanga with a nice Negra Modela to wash it down. The server, Cathy, was friendly and helpful in making my selection (20% tip). The food was served hot and the portions more than satisfying. Their house salsa had just the right amount of heat was the perfect condiment for this huge bowl of fresh made tortilla chips. Definitely worth a revisit while I am here and is one of my favorites when I return."}
{"text":"After hearing multiple people recommend this restaurant, we finally tried Serranos in Chandler. What a DISAPPOINTMENT! Here is my nutshell review: *** Overpriced menu and mediocre food, coupled with expensive, watery Margaritas. ***  --------------- First problem: We asked the waiter about drink prices- can you imagine $5 for a 16 oz. draft domestic beer? Then, the waiter told us that the Margaritas were $6.50, but when he delivered the Margarita, \"OOPS!\" The price went up to $7.00. When my wife ordered the nachos (8.99 for beans and cheese), the menu showed $2 extra for chicken or beef. However, the waiter advised us that the menu was wrong, it was actually $3 extra. I mentioned that the menu shows $10.99, but he stated that the menu was wrong, needed to be updated. I ordered their \"special\" Asada Chimichanga w/ \"Fundido\" sauce (came with a tiny cup of warm cream cheese, but no beans or rice on the side), for $11.99. It arrived undercooked, (tough and gooey crust- is that even a tortilla?) with beef filler that was over-seasoned with black pepper and salt, and chopped onions. As I scanned the dishes served to others around us, the main theme I noticed is that the entrees are small, but the plates are filled with lots of rice and watery beans. Our bill was $37 with tax and tip, but I could have spent $10 at Taco Bell and had a better Mexican food experience. AVOID!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant in Chandler, AZ. Nothing spectacular but simply great tasting food. The Special Combination is treat. You get everything, taco, enchilada and a tostada - a triple threat to you appetite. The paper thin Tortilla Chips served with in house salsa and warm refried beans is great.  It is a meal itself.  Try this joint when you are in Chandler. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Coming from Iowa, I was certainly hoping for a good plate of Mexican food and this place absolutely delivered.  The fried tacos (a special on this particular Tuesday) were priced very reasonably and came with rice and beans, all for about $6.  Shells tasted very fresh, though I was a little disappointed to see cheddar used on both the beans as well as the tacos.  This establishment is not stingy on chips & salsa--we went through two baskets and they didn't seem to mind some bit.  I've been to other restaurants who begrudgingly refill the basket.  Fried ice cream was delightful and had a nice balance of crispy/soft, warm/cold.  I also had iced tea and was out the door for under $11 (not including tip).  Certainly merits a visit if you're in the area; I hope to return to Phoenix soon and enjoy some more delicious food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this spot, located in historical Chandler by the famous Crowne Plaza Resort Hotel San Marcos. Eat in the bar if you can - a super cozy room with great ambiance."}
{"text":"Have eaten here for years,very friendly staff,love the fact local business,not chain.Food consistently good,my favorites chili relleno,and Serrano' combination,fajitas also good,overall feel at home here."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch specials and they are always very nice! Love the chips, salsa, and bean dip!"}
{"text":"Ordered food through DoorDash. My boyfriend ordered the chimichanga with chicken. Upon opening the box when it arrived his meal had no rice and beans which it states it comes with. The meal was also lacking a seasoned sour cream(whatever that is). When he started eating, there was barely any chicken which you have to pay extra for. Essentially was a refried bean chimichanga."}
{"text":"Just getting old, the decor, the carpet, the menu. Not impressed with anything here. The quality of the food was average."}
{"text":"Never disappointing here. Good reasonable prices and always great food. I good eat an entire meal of chips salsa and bean dip. I always ask for the hotter smooth sauce.  Ordered the combo and took half home.  If you love tamales for as order them from here they are awesome. One is plenty for a normal appetite."}
{"text":"Okay, first off, I'm a vegetarian so the only thing I ever order at Mexican restaurant is a bean and cheese burrito with a side of rice.  And this was the most average version since my Taco Bell day's circa 1999.  Margarita's were average too, and our group was disappointed to hear that they don't do pitchers of margarita's anymore.  On a good note, the chips and salsa is great and you get a bean and cheese dip to go with it too."}
{"text":"Pretty decent, nothing fantastic, no frills. Their salsa is great!"}
{"text":"Just simply ok. I could name a few better Mexican restaurants but here its never busy and the food is fairly cheep."}
{"text":"We've have been looking for a favorite Mexican restaurant since moving to AZ.  One visit and this place looks promising.  We went on a busy Friday night.  Had to wait a while and as we spoke with the other people waiting, they were all long time patrons.  Another very promising sign.  We were seated in the bar at a cozy booth and were served drinks, chips and salsa with beans right away.  We ordered and the food arrived pretty quickly.  We never had to ask for refills, the drinks just kept being refilled and they checked back often to see if we needed anything.  It was a great service experience and the food was very good."}
{"text":"The location of this place is great.  Downtown Chandler is one of my favorites in the phoenix metro area and this is probably one of the most frequented mexican food places in the area.    The mexican food here is good, dont get me wrong.  Yet, its not a home run (very few places ive been to in Phoenix are).  The chips came with salsa and bean dip which were good and pretty filling.    The chicken I ordered was well cooked and adequately flavored.  However, upon ordering a side of guacamole, I was underwhelmed by the size of the serving they gave.    Serranos is definitely a good joint.  Lookin for quality food with a great location, this is a good place to start."}
{"text":"Food isn't great but I enjoy coming here. Salsa and bean dip is the best part of this restaurant. I say this but I literally come here every week.  The cheese enchiladas are my favorite along with the salsa. I wish they would change to a better tortilla chip, they kinda suck but anything with their salsa and bean dip is edible. They have a more than an adequate kids menu and the service is usually decent. I've been coming here for over 30 years. I'm a creature of habit."}
{"text":"Serrano's is a classic old school Phoenix style Mexican restaurant.  The restaurant is located in downtown Chandler and has preserved the intimate feel of a family restaurant from yesteryear.    The salsa and chips are simply excellent.  The chips come out hot and fresh and the salsa is chunky and tasty.  The food is basic no frill, but great tasting no the less.  The fajitas are a sound choice when order as are the refried beans and rice.  The service is also great.    Highly recommended for a classically great tasting and comfortable outing for Mexican food locally."}
{"text":"Typical sit down Mexican restaurant you'd find in the valley. Service is prompt and restaurant is clean and inviting meaning we'd come back if we were in the area. Pricing for a two item combo with beans and rice is about typical with your choice of enchilada, taco, tostada, tamale, etc. I wasn't a big fan of the quest fundido appetizer and thought it was overpriced for the portion. I do love how they sell fresh tortillas at checkout- we had them two days later and they were delicious! Parking can be a bit of a nightmare on weekends, so I'd say visit during the week."}
{"text":"We went here before going to the Chandler center for the Arts and it was not a good idea.  The service was incredibly slow.  The restaurant was very loud.  When our food did finally come after asking a couple times for it my dinner was cold and the beans congealed. The tamale was cold cold not just cold from being left out. Cold like just out of the frig and partially warmed.  I would not recommend this place.  Lots of other good restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I have only been coming to Serrano's for 30 or so years... Salsa and chips with the warm bean dip is always great - I always get a taco, enchilada, rice, and beans. Ric and family have provided great food for chandler for a long time - the other locations are also very consistent excellent quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"Based on other Yelpers positive feedback we tried Serrano's for lunch wand high expectations, but were sadly underwhelmed. The food was OK, as was the service and décor but we'd wished we'd gone to Abuelo's instead. The details:  Food. Chips, salsa and bean dip appeared on the table virtually as we sat down. The chips were fresh and not too thick. The salsa was OK: it was fresh, but had a flavor (Mexican oregano perhaps?) that we did not care much for. The bean dip was not good - maybe we hit them on a bad day? The wife's cheese enchilada was good, but nothing special - same for my green pork enchilada-style burrito (both were $7.00). Two cold Dos Equis Ambers ($3.00) were the highlight of the meal!  Service. The guy delivering the chips and salsa was really on his game, and a manager stopped by to ask how things were. Our waitress was OK. Everyone was friendly and appeared to be trying hard.  Décor/Ambience. Not bad, but could use some updating."}
{"text":"Great food great service great price.   If you want big portion Mexican food this place is choice. Family run, local.  It gets a little loud sometimes, but we got a seat in the back. Our waitress Tandra was exemplary."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here at the chandler location tonight and was served curdled sour cream that tasted like rotten sour milk. 3 of my family members ate a few bites and started talking about how it tasted and that it was bad. When brought to the servers attention he went in the back area and came out saying it was a brand new container. We then asked for the manager whom wanted to argue for 15mins about how it was not bad sour cream, but seasoned and garlic in it. At this point my sons stomach was cramping and we had all lost our appetites as we sifted curds out of this \"fresh, brand new\" sour cream. The manager wouldn't eat it herself in our presence. As the manager wanted to debate that the sour cream was fine for 15mins...we all got up n walked out. Poor service and majorly poor management with bad customer service.  We have eaten at 2 other locations for many years and never have experienced what we did tonight!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local family owned Arizonan Mexican restaurant. We come here for the green chile tamale, their carne asada burro is very tasty too. Oh their signature is their chips and salsa and bean dip.  Cone when you're hungry!!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice now, but both times were AMAZING!  Great food, great service... will be back very soon.  FYI, you'll be tempted to fill-up on the out-of-this world salsa and dip which arrive to your table moments after you do. If at all possible, resist the urge. As good as these treats are, your entres will be even better.  Recommended are anything with the green chiles when in season, and if not, trust the Serrano family and their specials. We have been more than impressed thus far and will update this review as we go back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Ive been eating here more and more often lately, and I like the food.  If I want Mexican food, and I am in the downtown chandler area, this is where I stop in.  The food quality is consistent.  Being a creature of habit, I get the same thing every time I come here.  They are also serving cupcakes.  Looks like the change the flavor every once in a while too.  I have had a margarita flavored one, and a dark chocolate and chili one.  Tasty."}
{"text":"I'm hispanic, so I'v been around really good authentic mexican food all my life and also i cook real good mex food, so if its mexican food usally I'd rather cook myself because there isnt much places that offer good food with good prices. Serranos has the best foood ever!!!! I cant even believe theres people that gave this place bad reviews Of course everyone has diffrent taste buds but come on  people! maybe there used to bad imatation mexican food and not authentic,,but take it from a real true blooded hispanic...THIS FOOD IS THE BEST!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Family owned Mexican restaurant to eat at. Chips and salsa and Bean dip is always on point. Great lunch specials too."}
{"text":"Solid 4. The food is always good no matter what I've had there over the years. Bean dip & salsa are awesome and always complimentary.   Best thing about Serrano's is for lunch - they're very fast. Sadly unlike most of downtown chandler, Serrano's is fast and very nicely priced for lunch items. Staff is on top of things, drinks never empty and chips/dip never out. It makes for a great quick group lunch during the work week. Other places seem to take 1.5hrs in/out time.  No five simple because the scene is old, quiet and well... old. It's not bad, it's clean but just been there forever kind of old. There's no hipness to it, would never go there to drink at the bar,   I've been going to this location and others for years now and will continue to do so. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Several choices of hot salsa, bean dip offered at no extra charge, typical Mexican family resturant atmosphere, and good service. Chicken suizas were fantastic! Recommend it!"}
{"text":"I had tried the Serrano's on Guadalupe in Tempe many years ago & remember it being good.  We just moved near downtown Chandler, so I thought we would try Serrano's since I was craving a good margarita.  1st disappointment was the margarita.  It was not good, not strong and the second was even worse.  I thought I'd upgrade to the premium one and it had so much grand marnier in it that I couldn't stomach the sweetness.  I didn't want to send it back because at that point I was over it.  We sat in the bar.  It was warm, crowded and stuffy.  The server was horrible.  We ordered beef nachos to share and they were so greasy and awful that all I left with was an upset stomach.  They charged $2.75 for a tiny cup of extra sour cream.  The salsa was like marinara sauce.  No spice at all.  The bean dip was okay, but lukewarm.  When I did ask if they had Hot salsa,  they said yes but it was all out for the day?  Glad I tried it before taking my in-laws there next month!  We will find somewhere else to go!"}
{"text":"I have to rate this after eating at Si Senor, especially after some reviewers said they were better than Serrano's.  They're crazy!  Serrano's isn't the best Mexican food ever, but its WAY better than SS.  I've been to Serrano's several times and I would go back.  SS, I wouldn't go back if you paid me, sorry.  Serrano's has real beans, pretty good chips and salsa and the bean dip is really good (my wife loves it).  I've never had anything bad there, only once was I a little dissapointed when they didn't have oregano to put in the menudo (hello?  its like not having any ketchup for your fries!).    They have real (shredded) beef tacos.  Beans are tasty and NOT from a can.  Even their burgers are good.  This is good for white people Mexican food.  Anyway.... I just had to clear that up.  Serrano's is better than Si Senor dot com."}
{"text":"Chips come w/ salsa and beans. Dont be deceived - the beans are spicier than the salsa. Mix them on your plate = delish. Good, local start Mexican joint."}
{"text":"Never disappoints ..   Good food and good service.. I have been going here a long time. I will continue to go back"}
{"text":"I had not been here in a while and was a little surprised how run down the place had gotten. There was a large party before us so we went to the bar to wait for our table. When we opened the door to the bar area we were hit in the face with stale beer smell. I ordered a frozen margarita with a raspberry twist. I wanted something other that a beer for a change. The margarita had so much tequila that is all I could taste. There was no flavor of the raspberry or anything. While we waited for the table I watched the girl behind the bar over pouring all of the drinks. I am all about a strong drink but there is a point where the flavor is lost and it's over bearing. Once we got to out table the service was slow. The food is good though just be careful what you order to drink as the bar is lacking in quality."}
{"text":"We have been going to Serrano's, off and on, for about 15 years. Originally, the food was excellent, but the service was really poor.  The service people's attitude seemed to be, \"Why are you bothering me\".   Over the years the food quality has deteriorated and the service has gotten to even worse.  I cannot think of a single restaurant I would rate worse than Serrano's in Chandler.   After our visit yesterday, we will not be visiting this restaurant ever again.  for the first time I can remember, and I am older than dirt, I left NO tip."}
{"text":"Adore this local business. I've eaten at several locations over last decade. The food is always good. We've had parties here and catering from here. Awesome bean dip and salsa.  Appreciate gluten friendly options.  Always great service. We usually sit in bar area if just two of us"}
{"text":"Probably the best thing about Serrano's is the free chips, salsa, and bean dip. I could make my whole meal out of just these, but the restaurant probably wouldn't like it much. So, I go ahead and order a burrito, shredded beef taco, or chimi just to be safe.  Serrano's isn't the best Mexican food, I'll admit it. Most menu items are pretty standard Americanized-Mexican fare, actually. But I love a place with some history behind it, and Serrano's has loads.   Started by Ernie and Eva Serrano, it is the longest continually-operating establishment in Chandler. Today, 6 of the couple's 8 children work in the family business. The original downtown Chandler location burned down a few years ago, but they rebuilt right on the same spot. I also love that they are very involved in the community.   So give Serrano's a try, and see if you don't agree the free bean dip alone makes it worth a trip."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner. Chilies rellenos with machaca. I'd never had that before & I loved every bite. My companion had delicious spinach enchiladas. Wish I lived in the area,  because I'd come back often for the food & friendly service."}
{"text":"I grew up with awesome traditional Mexico food and this doesn't come close.  Everything seemed like it is out of a can.  Me and my wife left most of the food on our plates and went to Sonic after we left."}
{"text":"We Took my friends kids out for dinner to celebrate my birthday. The food was hot and fresh and excellent. The staff was very friendly and the kids enjoyed their mail. The sopapillas were excellent! We cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Was a little nervous to try this place after reading some of the mixed reviews but went last night with a group of 10 coworkers and we all had a fabulous time. Our waitress, Cathy, was great - sweet, didn't mind making 4 separate checks, prompt with Food and drink service and refilled our waters without asking. Eric was also great - he seemed to be in charge of the chips and dip and didn't mind bringing our more than a few refills for us. Seriously some of the best bean dip I have ever had. And the salsa is super flavorful and fresh with big chunks of onions tomatoes and cilantro throughout. Also - ask for the spicy salsa. Doesn't have as much texture as the original but has a nice kick! Even the chips were great - thin cut and served warm.   We each ordered some margaritas on the rocks which were tasty. Not the best I've ever had but they will do. Several coworkers also ordered a variety of Mexican beers which they enjoyed.   When we finally ordered the food, it all came out timely, correctly, and at the perfect temperature. Everyone seemed happy with their meals. Some of us were just too full from chips to finish though. Cathy didn't mind bringing boxes though! I ordered the pollo ranchero. The chicken is diced and mixed with tomatoes, green chili, and onion. This was the best part of the dish. The refried beans were yummy too but the rice was a bit bland. Would have liked a side of the guacamole which was on every other entree plate except for mine. But I was able to steal a bit from someone next to me. The dish also came with two large tortillas which weren't even necessary but were a nice addition. They were a bit charred which gave them an awesome flavor. Finally, the fresh Serrano pepper on the plate is a cute touch!   We had brought our own cake for this occasion and Cathy didn't mind bringing out fresh forks and side dish plates for us. She didn't force any of the restaurants desserts or coffees on us either.   Overall, I would come here again!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times in the last few years, as well as gotten take-out from this location. I have never been so disappointed as tonight. Serrano's has never been \"super\" food wise, but has never been as poor quality as this. Completely greasy, half cooked, and tasteless. Inconsistent temperatures throughout food. More than 50$ for less than 2 meals (the only reason this rates 2 stars is because of the bean dip- still okay). Also we picked up the food. Five minutes from our house. I have always justified going to Serrano's because we like to support local businesses, family atmosphere, and usually decent food. Unfortunately they seem to have given up and don't care about their product or customers ."}
{"text":"I come to this Mexican restaurant every time I'm in town. There are a few others that they've opened up in the surrounding area, but this is the original. The staff is always super nice and helpful, and the food always delicious. They bring chips with their in house salsa and bean dip (big hit with the kids), and the meals are made with homemade tortillas which are also available to purchase to take home (which I always do). Something to always looks forward to on visits home!"}
{"text":"Worst place to eat at food is over priced and people work there are rude I can find better food at some were else then being on the news health report card uh no don't eat here"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The atmosphere is a little dark and depressing but the food makes up for it! The bean dip is the best!"}
{"text":"The price was nice, but I guess you get what you pay for. The food was ok, but it's probably not a place I'll venture to again."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I was younger with my family.... The other Restaurant we first were going to go didn't open for another 30 mins so we decided to come here, This time only with my mom, boyfriend and son. Over the years the food went down hill. The best thing about our meal was the chips and beans and also the cheese crisp. But the meal portion not pleasing for ALL of us.... I ordered the season ground beef taco, and shredded beef tamale with rice and beans. Taco was dripping with a pool of grease got half way and couldn't finish, the tamale red sauce had an off taste. Rice and beans were okay.... But with the main course off setting,  I just didn't want to finish my meal. My boyfriend didn't even finish his meal either because the ground beef enchiladas was over seasoned and just way to salty. My mom was off and on with the food... But later she told me it made her sick and kept throwing up.... All in all, I/WE will never come back to THIS location."}
{"text":"BEST chips, salsa and bean dip EVER.  And it's unlimited when you eat in the restaurant.  I've been going to this place once a week for over ten years and it is delicious and very affordable!!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Mexican food restaurant ! Whatever you order make sure it has the shredded chicken in it . I seriously crave this food constantly ... We have eaten here for lunch and dinner , and we have been on weekdays and weekends . The consistency is impressive . They have a special for every day (except Sunday's, they are closed that day) . They also have a happy hour , and if you eat in the bar you can get anything off their appetizer menu 1/2 off.  I highly recommend the cheese crisp topped w/ shredded chicken . They also offer a 10% off discount with AAA."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food you can get in Chandler considering the they are THE Mexican place to eat in chandler. I've eaten almost everything on the menu and a few times it didn't agree with my taste buds but I'm like that, I'll try anything once even if I don't know what I'll like about it. Your only here once so make sure you try everything.   I've been eating at Serrano's since I made my way to Phoenix way back in 98 both Mesa and Chandler  Chris B, there is a del taco on germann and gilbert that would be better suited to your level of taste but they don't serve beer.   As for the adult video store next door, you could really do yourself a favor and spend some money in there. If, for no other reason than to rub one out and relax, you, really sound like you need to.   Its a great place to eat. Friend or foe I tell the truth."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! We visited Serranos a couple years ago and I was delighted; it was busy too. Today my husband and I stopped to eat lunch. There were 4 total but I have to admit it was around 2:00.  I ordered a taco salad with shredded beef. It came with shredded chicken. The server apologized and brought one with beef. The lettuce came in chunks the size of half my fist. (Can someone at least bring me a board and some knives so I can finish the job??)   There was NOTHING but meat and lettuce. I asked for some shredded cheddar. The server said, \"oh you want more cheese?\"  I wanted to say, \"No I want SOME cheese\".  Then I bit into the beef. It tasted like it had been lying in water. The chips at the start were horrible:  bland, saltless, cold.  Who's cooking back there anyway??  I have to say the margarita was great; but I came there to eat, not drink."}
{"text":"My family and I come here often and we love it! The food is delicious, the service is fast and the wait staff is super friendly. They even sang happy birthday to my son, presenting him with a Sombrero and ice cream. He loved it! It's great to find a place so family friendly! Bonus points for the delicious chips, salsa and beans that they serve when we sit down at our table!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night planning dinner with 6 ladies and service was great.  They gave us a quiet area where we could plan and lots of bean dip (yummy!) and salsa.  My prickly pear margarita was perfect.  The taco salad with machaca beef was moist and full of flavor as it should be.  Great food for years and they still haven't changed."}
{"text":"Good food. I like the bean dip and salsa mixed with chips. Have gone to the Mesa location with co-workers twice now for lunch. Always fast service and good food. Too bad they aren't open on Sunday."}
{"text":"We eat here often and love the food, especially the bean dip. This past summer, we attended a STAYcation at San Marcos and the dining was a tequila dinner at Serrano's. Janet Thebarge, sales manager, promoted the experience at the Chandler Chamber and WOW what a fun night. The food was extraordinary, the company lively and the tequila--delish! Thanks for a great experience...do it again soon!"}
{"text":"Service was excruciatingly slow. It took three times longer because the waitress said the \"grilled\" chicken started frozen. Then they overcooked it and it was super dry.   The manager never came to check on us or apologize for the super slow service.  Kids menu says \"drinks included\", but I was charged for the kids drinks. The waitress said its because the kids menu is for 10 and younger, but why didn't the menu or the waitress explain this detail when we ordered the kids drinks. The old bait and switch.   I've been coming to Serranos for many years and tonight was our last visit."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible and the service is almost as bad. The tamales were probably the worst I have ever had.  The burrito looked like it came out of a freezer.  And don't get me start d on the green Chile"}
{"text":"We've actually never eaten at the actual restaurant, so this review is purely for catering services.   We hosted a small dinner party at our home for 10 people, and chose to do a taco bar. Serrano's worked with us to slightly customize their taco bar offering, was very easy to work with and responsive to all of our questions, and reasonably priced. They even delivered to our house despite us not meeting the minimum (20 people).   The delivery driver was 10 minutes early, extremely friendly, and set up the bar beautifully. Their catering comes with a TON of food - bean dip, salsa, chips, rice, bunuelos, along with the entree. We had tons left over - their portion sizes are extremely generous.   I would absolutely recommend them to anyone needing mexican catering and will definitley use them again should the need arise. Thank you, Serrano's, for making our event a success! (We'll have to come try your restaurant too since we enjoyed the catering so much!)"}
{"text":"The food is very good and service. The restaurant looks very clean. The prices are responsible for the food that is served."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the food quality has gone downhill consistently over the past couple of years. The last few meals have been super super greasy and under or overcooked. Chips and deep fried foods are dripping oil. The only thing they seem to be able to keep tasting good is the bean dip. This is very disappointing as we have loved them for so long and they have been a staple in downtown Chandler forever. I hope they turn it around or they will be out of business soon. :("}
{"text":"So many memories at this place. I have been coming here since I was a little kid. The staff has always been friendly. Serrano's has always had top tier quality bean dip and salsa to go along with their chips. Few restaurant rival them in that area. I know plenty of people who come here just for the chips and salsa so that should tell you something about how good they are. The food on the other hand is fairly average. The price for their food is pretty fair and a little on the lower side.  This location is right in the heart of downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"Amazing and traditional Mexican food. I have been eating here my whole life and it is definitely a community staple. The service is sometimes a hit or miss but the good servers stick around. The food is reasonably priced and I have never not enjoyed a meal. I still meet friends from back in the day here when they are in town because it is the first thing they crave when they step off that plane!"}
{"text":"My parents brought me here when I was visiting them in Mesa.  It was great!  It's not a hole in the wall burrito shop (which would be my preference), but it was really tasty, and the service was fantastic!  I loved this place, and would definitely go back when I'm in the area.  The enchiladas were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars...Don't come here unless you want to be abused and nickeled and dimed to death... my friends and I come here for lunch three out of four of us each ordered a bowl of soup and drinks. Because one of my friends wasn't eating they decided to charge us seven dollars for chips and salsa that are supposed to come complementary with the meal. I will never eat here again all they care about is money, customer service is not important to this establishment... the soup was also cold... WARNING do not eat here..."}
{"text":"Downtown Chandler is my favorite location. They have great red sauce."}
{"text":"Really good American Style Mexican food at a reasonable price.  Went on Sunday for dinner. Had the #39 (Green Chile Beef Chimichanga with Rice and Beans), it was tremendous! Even my finicky son enjoyed his Bean & Cheese Burro. We all enjoyed the complimentary, fresh tasting chips & salsa / bean dip.  Decent selection of draught & bottled beers too.  Drinks were refilled fast and often, service was really friendly."}
{"text":"Having lived in chandler for 13 years, I finally went to Serrano's in downtown Chandler.  I was so impressed by their story and how their family has been doing business in Chandler for years and how much they are involved in the community.  Their bean dip and salsa is to dye for!  The food was great and so was the manager and my server.  Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"For the second year in a row, we had a sales meeting in Chandler. Serrano's is within walking distance of the hotel, so we walked over, after bypassing another Mexican place...  Serrano's is a friendly place. The Mexican joint next to the SanTan would not seat us together (7 people in the group!), and the wait was 45 minutes. So we left that place and went to Serrano's. As usual, my advice was excellent... We were seated immediately!  (Okay, okay, I got lucky!)  Anyway, the food was as good as I had remembered it from the year before, and the bean dip was exceptionally good. I had a wonderful Pollo Ranchero dish that filled me to bursting. I don't think anyone was disappointed. Margaritas were tasty, and service was attentive but not pressured.   This is a family place, and it's good for groups. They have several rooms where they can accommodate larger parties. I'd go there if I were in Chandler again."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a few years and they've made some great changes! Tortillas are made in-house now, as is most everything else. Delicious! Chips were crispy and warm. Service was outstanding. Austin was a great server."}
{"text":"The only reason this place isn't getting one star is because the last time I went the chips and bean dip really satisfied the fact that I hadn't eaten all day.  Too bad the enchiladas sucked (thick, soggy tortillas???? and beef with too much black pepper???????), the rice sucked, and even the cheese on top of my refried beans sucked."}
{"text":"Here we go another Americanized Mexican restaurant kind of a copy cat of Garcias but not as good .. Food is decent rice is horrible and bland beans are beans and salsa is just that salsa. Had the Pollo Fundido which is a green chile chicken chimi cover in sour crean and cheddar cheese melt over the top. It was ok had better at Garcias and El Norteno. Just wasn't impressed at all with the quality and look of the place . Time to remold and redo some of them dishes ."}
{"text":"Great location in downtown Chandler. They serve beans (with a kick to the flavor) with the salsa to go with your complimentary chips. My husband really enjoyed his steak tacos, my bean burrito was sub-par at best."}
{"text":"Serrano's is to Mexican food as Friday's is to American food.  That is to say Beans and Rice are to French Fries as Corona is to Budweiser.  What I mean is Chimichanga is to Cheeseburger as Salsa and Chips is to Bread and Butter.  So you have Quesadilla to Pizza as Margarita to Cosmopolitan.  In summary, Two stars is to restaurant ratings as Die Hard is to movies.    It'll get the job done but it won't be memorable or soon repeated."}
{"text":"Love going here. They give you chips, salsa and bean dip when you first sit down. We always get a cheese crisp for an appetizer. Its delicious. The tacos, enchiladas, rice, etc is all good. I also love ordering the taco salad. Its also delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible overpriced food at Serrano's, and the beans are definitely out of the can... no authentic food here!!!  It's the worst Mexican food ever, yuk!"}
{"text":"Great food as always. Their bean dip is awesome as it has a little kick to it. Sonoran enchiladas are awesome as are the chimichangas. They're cool about accommodating orders."}
{"text":"This is A family owned and operated restaurant that has been around forever in Chandler. Their food is absolutely awesome as is the service. If you aren't in the mood to eat out or you need somewhere to just pick up some appetizers for a party definitely go here and get takeout bean dip salsa and chips. Every time we visit Arizona we make it a point to come to this restaurant. I really can't say more about this place other than it is one of our absolute favorites."}
{"text":"Still looking for that elusive Mexican food joint, so I stopped by here and gave it a try. The salsa was very good, nice flavor with just a right amount of heat...in other words you could taste the salsa.  I ordered a chicken burro which was good, not great.  the chicken didnt seem to be grilled but must have been, no flavor just blah. Prices OK, service very good, tea and water pitcher on table which is great for those refills. Will give it another try."}
{"text":"ATTENTION!!  I EXPERIENCED A LIFE--OR-DEATH SITUATION AT THIS FACILITY!!  Let me apologize in advance because what I am about to tell you will not be a short story, but WORTH READING!!! If I could give a negative rating I would.This evening I experienced one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences of my life. I ordered the shrimp fajitas and with the first bite of my meal I began to choke. I was terrified and didn't know what to do. I stood up and put my hands around my throat indicating I was choking. After what seemed like a lifetime my sister stood up and began to perform the Heimlich maneuver. After several abdominal thrusts the obstruction in my airway became dislodged and I could begin to breath again. Everyone in the room was starring and asking if I was ok and someone called 911. I sat down at the table still coughing up remanence of the food and phlegm still lodged in my throat when the waiter approached the table. He asked if we would like a couple Togo boxes and the check, showing no concern of my current state or my distress . My sister gave the waiter her credit card to pay. At the time I was still trying to wrap my mind around what had just happened and was in a state of shock. The police and fire department came and checked me out to make sure I didn't need further medical attention. They informed me that I was going to be ok and said I was good to go home.   Now that I've had time to calm myself and think about the circumstances of the situation I can't help but feel displeased and angry about the how heartless and unprofessional the Serranos staff handled this predicament and angry that my sister paid for the meal that could've been my last. I would advise you to spend your money elsewhere. I'm going to tell everyone I know about what had taken place tonight at this facility and I won't spend another dime at ANY Serrano's franchise.   I would also like to suggest that they get their staff CPR certified in case something like this were to occur again."}
{"text":"The food quality and quantity definitely went down hell.  Ordered a special chicken dish but where is chicken?!  All I got was some strings of chicken and lots black beans.  This is the first visit at this location and the serving bowels for salsa and bean dip were so small made it difficult to grab dip.  Totally disappointed and will not be back to this location!  Tempe location is far better!"}
{"text":"Service: First I would like to disclose the fact that we did have a large group for lunch. That being said, we only had one server and were there over two hours. Everything took a really long time from ordering to getting drinks to getting food. We often had empty water glasses and pitchers. Folks didn't get refills on drinks or waited a really long time. Then when it came to the food, a few people didn't get their meals until after everyone else was done. I ordered fajitas and got the meat, rice and beans but waited a long time to get tortillas so it ended up not being hot. I also never got any guacamole.   Food: We ordered the queso fundido and it was terrible. We thought it would be melted cheese with peppers but all it just the stuff they put on top of burritos and chimichangas, not a dip! The best queso fundido we've had is at La Fonda in Tempe. As I mentioned earlier in the service part, I ordered the fajitas. I received the beans, rice and meat but waited so long for the tortillas that everything was no longer hot. I also didn't receive any quacamole or cheese. On a positive note, the steak was very tender and flavorful. I would order it again if I was with a smaller group of people.   Overall I would go back because it is convenient and usually decent food however I would definitely not go with a big group."}
{"text":"Mexican food for Gringos.  I understand that these types of restaurants serve a niche for snow birds who want Margaritas and a \"chimi\" (Try ordering a chimichanga in Mexico).  On par for sub-mediocre American-Mexican food the likes of Garcias and Abuelos."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to this location. I have been several years ago to others. I remembered the food being better than it was today. I was really looking forward to starting off with margaritas but I sat at the bar and saw they were in a pre-made container for pouring which prompted me to ask if I could taste it first. Thank goodness I did, it was extremely sweet like lemonade and I had to ask if the tequila was already mixed it. He said it was so I decided against the margarita. Then I ordered the chile rellano, and my friend ordered chicken and shrimp fajitas. The plate of fajitas came out sizzling hot and smelled good. Unfortunately, it came out wrong, and the meat was also pretty tasteless. The chile rellano was very soggy and covered with beans. The best thing about the meal was the salad and chips which I ate my fair share of. The lighting was too dark to see the menu well and hate to say it but the bartender was more like a drive thru window order taker, nice but not fun or helpful. Prob wouldn't be my first choice for dinner next time."}
{"text":"People who rate this place over 2 stars are either \"on the books\" or suffered from a frontal lobotomy.   Here are 6.5 reasons not to go here:  1) El Zocalo had a 2.5hr wait last night, so we walked across the street to Serranos and was immediately seated  2) Ordered Don Julio Margaritas, received 4 small wine glasses with Sweet & Sour (waitress acknowledged they were made with too little alcohol)  3) Terrible Ambiance (drop tile-ceiling, commercial pressboard restaurant tables)  4) Waitress couldn't remember what anyone ordered numerous times (forgot sour cream, forgot corn tortillas)  5) Rather than coming by to fill up the water, they leave pitchers on the table  6) the food was doused in salt; heck, even this morning I had to move my watch band out a notch  6.5) There's an adult video store next door..."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley!! Our family has been coming here for years. We love the service and the food. Salsa is chunky which I love and they include beans to go with the chips."}
{"text":"My wife and I chose Serrano's for dinner because they were among the local restaurants donating a portion of their proceeds today to the Chandler Center for the Arts. We appreciate their support. One of the bonuses of eating there tonight is that Miss Tempe, Miss Mesa, and Miss Teen Mesa, if I remember correctly, were going from table to table soliciting additional contributions and offering customers the opportunity to sign up for a raffle. Never before had I been in the presence of such royalty.  But you were wanting to know about the restaurant. The food was average. Not bad by any means, but mild and aimed at the masses. The portion sizes were big. The prices were reasonable.  We were both pleased to find vegetarian entrees on the menu. I ordered spinach enchiladas with green sauce and sides of rice and black beans. My wife ordered a big honking burro. I tasted it, and it was good but clearly not memorable because I don't remember what was in it. She was pleased to have been offered the choice of green or red sauce. She chose green. It came with red. We let it slide. She ordered a raspberry margarita. She liked it. I tasted it, and found it both too sweet and too tangy. I could barely taste the tequila.  Major kudos to Josh, our waiter-in-training who was shadowing a more experienced server. He did a bang-up job considering it was his was first night. He was friendly and attentive without being too friendly and attentive. I threw him a curve ball by ordering a Diet Pepsi with a splash of Cherry Pepsi, but he came through for me. I was surprised the server he was shadowing didn't remind him to offer us dessert. But that's OK. We wouldn't have had room anyway.  The décor was a pleasant, understated, mildly outdated Mexican theme with faux hardwood floors, hand stenciling on the walls, and vertical saguaro ribs above the seats. We liked that they played Mexican music over the sound system, even though they didn't venture beyond hackneyed tunes such as \"Guadalajara.\" Few things in life are more aggravating than walking into a Mexican restaurant that plays whatever music the staff likes. Mexican food and Air Supply just don't mix.  Serrano's isn't our favorite restaurant in downtown Chandler, but then they have stiff competition. It would be an excellent choice for entertaining out-of-towners. We will be back. Eventually."}
{"text":"Management is rude. I was asked to remove my gun and take it to my car halfway through my meal. I informed the manager that legally they need to have a sign on the front door if they don't want people carrying. She told me that there is a sign, in the back, in front of the entrance to the cantina. Dont you think that might be because they dont want guns in the cantina? She said she would look into the law. Next time I passed by I noticed they had put a no firearms sign on the front door. I walked across the street and at at El Zocalo instead. The food is better, the service is better, and they arent anti gun. Those who support the second amendment, boycott Serranos.On top of that the food is mediocre at best. Out of the 15 or so places I've eaten in the area their salsa is second from bottom. El Zocalo, Espos, and Los Dos Molinos are all much better options."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my trip to Serrano's- while in Phoenix with family for Christmas, we stopped in our last day before leaving for the airport. Lots of chips and salsa, water and iced tea delivered to our table in pitchers, and by the amount of people here at lunch time I could determine that they do a mean lunch hour. Fairly standard for what you get at most Mexican restaurants, but came out quickly and hot. The house margaritas are large and cheap. If I come back to Phoenix, I know I know I'll stop by again."}
{"text":"The green chili was pretty good- everything else was just meh. I was not hungry when I left but I didn't dig it too much- the place was empty on a Saturday evening around 7pm (there's a reason) we waited 20 minutes with like 4 servers walking by us before anyone asked if we had been helped. Some guy walks in behind us and he's greeted right away-- finally I just said, \" can we just sit anywhere?\" The guy seats us and puts us at a table that had someone else's mess from eating on it still... gross. I love Mexican food but I won't ever eat there again. The bean dip is not that good. Sorry"}
{"text":"Well....  It's a 2 star rated restaurant to me.  It's ok, I won't probably go back again as there are plenty of superior options that have better tasting food.  Even Filibertos has a better tasting carne asada burrito than this place.  I was disappointed, to say the least.    The wait staff was friendly and we were brought pitchers of water and bowls of chips with salsa and bean dip as appetizers.  Quite a few people who have previously reviewed this restaurant have raved about how great the bean dip is but for me, to be perfectly honest, it wasn't really that special.  Garcias will give you bean dip too...and I think it tastes better.  Their salsa is supposedly award winning?  What does award winning salsa taste like?  Not like this watered down blandly flavor that was put in front of me I hope.    The carne asada burrito I ordered was dry and very peppery.  I definitley wouldn't recommend it.  I was dining with five other people and some of them did enjoy their food but I don't remember anyone going GA GA over it or anything.   Pricewise the place seemed a little high for what I got as well.  I would probably go to Garcia's or even Elmer's tacos before I'd go here again.    I don't like to give low scores.  I hate it...but I just wanted to warn anyone who might be thinking about giving this place a try.    Have a great day!"}
{"text":"I don't always give one stars, but when I do, it's because they deserved it. Came here with some friends to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. Their mecheladas are really bad; watered down, no flavor. We ordered appetizers and they came out with our meal an hour later. The table behind me ordered a fajita plate and it came out sizzling hot and smelling so good, so that enticed me to order the same. An hour later, my fajita came out and there was no sizzling happening on that cast iron pan because it was sitting out in the kitchen waiting to be delivered to the table for a long time. The server kept forgetting our drink orders and we had to remind her several times. 5 out of the 6 people at our table asked for hot sauce and 20 minutes later after we had to remind her again, she brought out one little cup of hot sauce for the table that wasn't even enough for two people to share. We asked for jalapenos and they charged us $2 for it. We ordered a chimichanga and if I remember correctly at every other place we've ordered that it comes with green chili sauce and cheese on top of the fried burrito, but this one was dry, the meat and filling had no flavor. The white menudo was salty and really bad. This place is a sorry excuse for mexican food and we will NEVER, EVER, EVER, be back."}
{"text":"We hosted my fathers 80th bday party here and they did any excellent job!!  We had the bigger banquet room.  I mention this because I think it is the nicer room.  The food was excellent as well.  Didn't give the full five stars because at the designated time, when the event was over..we did feel that they wanted us out of the room even though there were no other events after us......"}
{"text":"This is the worst, crappy \"Mexican\" food I've ever had.  First of all,  they had no drink menus.  Said they were \"working\" on them.  So I ordered a Cuervo 1800 Margarita with a grand mariner float.  They put it in a mix.  In a mix.  And it wasn't cheap.  Secondly, we got chips, salsa,  and bean dip. Chips are super salty and the rest was just ok. After waiting so long to order, we had eaten a whole bowl of chips.  I ordered chicken fajitas.  I hate onions so I asked for avacado and was told \"we don't sell avacados.  Only guacamole. \"So I got the guacamole. Again,  a huge wait for food.  The fajitas did not have green pepper.  Instead,  they had jalapeño which one would think this would give it flavor but instead tasted like something you'd get at Applebee's.  The beans were mushy and the rice tasteless. Oh yeah,  and no patio seating.  A total disappointment and we will never,  ever be back.  There are dozens of Mexican restaurants, including a very good one across the street.  Don't bother with Serranos."}
{"text":"Delicious salsa and friendly service. Serrano's Mexican restaurant is a wonderful place to dine in at.   The restaurant is well decorated with lots of tables and booths.  If you come here early enough,  you can sit wherever you wanted. Shortly after we we're seated, our waitress showed up and introduced the menu.  She was nothing but a sweatheart throughout the night. She has high energy, super friendly, and would not stop checking up on us every 15-20 minutes or so. Busboy also checked up on us to see if we need water or refill frequently.    For my main entree, I ordered a Carne Asada with beef. The meat was a bit too dry for me. However, the meat was well seasoned, portion was generous, and it came with guacamole, bean, spanish rice and tortillas. The whole meal was delicious. There was so much food I simply do not have room for dessert.   I will come back here again to try different dishes. Overall, I am glad that I came here."}
