{"text":"I haven't lived in AZ since the turn of the Millennium but to this day the Golden Phoenix (or Jimmy's as I remember it) is still hands down my favorite Szechuan. I would go in there alone and order $45 worth of dishes. There is one dish however that James' chef did that has absolutely ruined me for... the HOT & SOUR SPICY SOUP*          my god!     Never in the last 16 or however many years of my searches of the China Towns in various cities have I found anything like this. Everyone who visited me in AZ would be treated to this experience and it was unanimously agreed, best Hot & Sour.  If you don't have the pallet for spicy you can't go wrong with My Shu dishes, oh hell order everything and take home 26lbs of leftovers. I miss you so badly Golden. All this reminiscing, I may have to fly back this winter just for dinner."}
{"text":"I have had a really tough time finding good Chinese food in Phoenix.  In the ten years I have lived here, nothing compared to the stuff I used to get at home.  I think this is common for a lot of people.  

My first impression walking into Golden Phoenix, is that the place is beautiful.  Sometimes Chinese restaurants look like they came from the 80's and refuse to leave.  I know that the decor doesn't make the food taste better, but this place is stunning!

Speaking of the food, I found it to be very tasty.  My dining companion ordered the hot and sour soup.  I generally  think that hot and sour soup tastes like a cigarette butt, but my companion enjoyed his.  I even tried a sip, and it was nice.

We also ordered kung pao chicken, and stir fried rice.  I was told that the fried rice was similar to what is common on the east coast.

The service was pleasant and there was some very cool live music.

Overall I was pleased, and may have found my go-to Chinese restaurant.  And it only took 11 years."}
{"text":"Most disappointing. I had been here many years ago and I remembered the food to be quite tasty. Both the service AND the food left much to be desired. I would consider the food itself to be average at best and comparable to a greasy take-out place. The lo mein was on par with a frozen TV dinner. The sesame chicken was better but not by much. The hot and sour soup was average, as well. The service was rushed. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"The best place on earth, seriously number 7 on the menu is the bomb and really friendly service"}
{"text":"Golden Phoenix is by far the best Chinese food place in Phoenix. My husband's parents have been going there since they started dating, and they attest that the food has remained just as delicious! The woman that seats us is always pleasant and friendly. The young waitress is super sweet and always refills drinks in a timely manner. She always boxes up any leftovers for you. We always get the Sesame Chicken, Chow Mein, and Lemon Chicken. All of which are fantastic! Overall, a very nice place to eat and the owners are always friendly. Very pleased."}
{"text":"I have gone here on and off for over 25 years. It was always the special place for family birthdays and such. My husband who is not a fan of Chinese food was at one of these events at the Golden Phoenix, when he found their House Special Chicken. He loves it, craves it frequently. So now, we order to go, often, which makes me really happy. The food is always plentiful and delicious, we get it home and it is still steaming hot, lovely flavors. We always get the House Special Chicken, it is crispy, tender and the sauce is light but tasty. I have tried lots of things on the menu and never been disappointed from noodles, soups, fried rice, lemon chicken, egg foo young, you name it, they make it and it is good. We will be back, probably next week for my hubbies next round of House Special Chicken and all I can say is Thank You to the Golden Phoenix for opening his mind and expanding his food world."}
{"text":"I'm still searching for good Chinese food here in Phoenix, and this restaurant did not complete my quest. I have to admit, I was initially excited by the decor as it reminded me of the fantastic Chinese restaurants I would visit growing up in Sacramento. But the food did not measure up: Canned mushrooms. Bland, runny brown sauce. Flavorless egg roll. Overcooked and stale fried wontons. After a few bites, I was not inspired to continue eating. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Ordered the feast for 2. Pu pu platter was good - but isn't any fried platter good? The Mongolian beef has orangish color beef. Most boring chow mein and the sweet sour pork left little to be desired. Might of been fault for ordering the set menu. 

I am still looking for quality good original non-pf Chang Chinese in phx."}
{"text":"I came here because of multiple locals suggested it, but it was greasy, no flavor and just disappointing. I can't understand how this place has such great reviews. Maybe I came on a bad day and with their style of Chinese food just like everyone else in the valley, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Since everyone eventually reviews P.F. Chang's, I thought I would give you all an alternative, a great, Americanized Chinese food restaurant. 

The Golden Phoenix is a great example of a successful Chinese restaurant. They do excel in most ways but  fall short in others. First off, for an appetizer, get the Mu Shu, its the best I've found in town. The Hot and Sour Soup is great too, good balance of flavors. Great noodles, and rice always seems fresh. Most of the chicken and tofu entrees are cooked extremely well, as the chicken is tender and tofu is firm and sauteed well. Now for the not so good, stay away from beef entrees. As most Chinese restaurants, the beef used is from a cut that needs to be finessed, its tough if not cooked delicately, most of the time its cooked too long and gets rubbery, Michelin/Goodyear like. Stick with chicken or tofu. 

As for the service and decor both are better then most. The restaurant looks like a Chinese restaurant should, bright with Asian decor. The service is prompt and professional. 

As a previous review stated, they don't handle parties well, I disagree, I planned a party for 25 and they handled it quite well. In fact when the check came I tipped above the automatic gratuity (reserved for large parties). 
 
Take out is outstanding as I tend to call in my order and pick up rather then a take out from Pei Wei (support the little guy!). To make things easier the menu is available online at their website. 

Here is the web address, at this time though its not loading properly, check again if the page is not available.

{"text":"Rude service,  and horrible food horribly overpriced. Figured egg rolls and sesame chicken would be simple enough but apparently not for this place, got some battered peices of what tasted nothing like sesame or chicken to me as well as egg rolls that were the size of hot dogs they were so deep fried and didn't taste too much different then a hot dog strangely enough. Stay away from here if you enjoy Chinese food or edible food!!"}
{"text":"Great little place.  Went in on a Saturday and they were not that busy so my kids and I were a little worried.  So glad we just sat down and tried it out.  Friendly service, great food, and my kids loved it.  I would recommend a drive to Phoenix to try it out."}
{"text":"The food is average and little too bland for my taste ... The service is good and the decorations are nice . There are more tastier Chinese than this place ."}
{"text":"A grand mandarin dinner is refreshing for anyone seeking an authentic american chinese dinner. The chinese always do it better though and this place has the best looking waitresses in the crown jewel of the west. The serve delicious buffalo wings. Thats the american coming out, compliments to chef Billy. Confusioun says \"A progressive meal even satisfies those who speek chinese\"  If you order the chinese itch, beware.... aunt ling dai will have your liver itching for hours! WE love going here even if just for the scenary."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 40 years and it is always great! The service was outstanding and there is no place that has better kung pao beef!"}
{"text":"My boss recommended this restaurant to me....well it was more of a command to eat at the Golden Phoenix. My husband and I tried this restaurant for date night and absolutely loved it! It definitely is one of the best authentic Chinese restaurants I have eaten in my life!

Their menu states right on top that their chicken is all white meat and they do not use MSG. I ordered the mar far chicken and it was to die for and my husband ordered the orange chicken which was absolutely delicious and just as the menu stated the chicken was juicy breast meat and I couldn't have been happier.

Everyone....GO TO THE GOLDEN PHOENIX!!!"}
{"text":"Best egg rolls in town.  Really enjoyed the pan fried noodles and generals chicken.  Wasn't a big fan of the hot and sour soup.  Vegetarians will enjoy both the tofu with black bean sauce and I getsauce.  The veg hu dishes are Light and fresh and not too greasy."}
{"text":"Best chinese food in phoenix i think.. I have been going here for the past 15-20years and i dont think i have ever gone wrong with it.. The ambiance is so beautiful and chinese. Location is not so great but once you get in, its totally worth it.. 

My favorites: Ken's Special Salad, Hot & Sour Soup, Mu-Shu, Fried Banana, and the Tea. 

Everyone i have ever taken here always begs to go back cause the food is just so amzing. 
its a family owned restaurant and the owners are just great sweet people!"}
{"text":"Golden Phoenix is Amazing!! Ken and MaryAnne are both extremely friendly and always greeting all their guests with a warm welcoming greeting! The Food!! OH the FOOD!!! IT IS THE BEST Chines restaurant in Phoenix!! We always start with Crab Wantons and their Delicious Egg Rolls!! The entrees are wonderfully flavorful and Delicious!! We always order their Pork Fried Rice!! My Favorite!! They have an amazing selection of entrees. We have honestly not had anything that we didn't LOVE!! Make sure you go and visit!!"}
{"text":"Put in an order for takeout and was treated very rudely. Lady was very impatient and would not answer our questions. Ended up not even getting food because she hung up on us. Don't know if food is good or not but customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"Homemade. Real fresh veggies. No msg. Not greasy. Yummm! Thanks for a scrumptious lunch."}
{"text":"This is my go-to neighborhood place for 20 years. They get the food out quickly, and it is reasonably priced. They handle a lot of take-out orders, too.

The food is Americanized Chinese food, which is great with me. Examples: Chow mein, Chop suey, Egg foo yung...  They are glad to customize the dishes, for example if you want a spicy version of something, or you want to change the protein....

The owners are always there, and the servers are friendly.  I have gone early, late, and all times in between. They are closed on Mondays. 

The lunch menu is limited and offers some egg rolls and soup with a main dish for a special price.

My favorite dish is the lettuce wraps, which comes with any protein you like. I choose the tofu.  The rice noodles are crispy, and the lettuce is crunchy. They make the rolls tableside. Make sure to say \"yes\" when they offer the plum sauce. 

The only thing I don't like is that the booth seats are soft and lumpy.  If you have back issues, you might want to sit at a table."}
{"text":"Its unfortunate that this place shut its doors not that long ago- there wasn't a thing here that I didn't like. The decor, while a bit dated, was beautifully ornate, and the staff was spectacular. As for the food, I was especially fond of the almond chicken and everything that came on their pupu platter. Their spicy dishes weren't all that spicy (which is why I gave this place a 4), but I didn't have any complaints beside that.

All in all, I'm glad to have been here as many times as I could, and despite seeing a Valley icon shut its doors, I'll always have that memory with me."}
{"text":"Try the sizzling rice - I've never had this before or noticed it on menus at other Chinese restaurants, but it was so good."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good Chinese place to eat.  Looking at other reviews, we decided to try it out.  We are glad we did.  The food was excellent.  Very tasty and the Mar Far chicken was awesome.  After talking with the owner, we found out the husband used to be a cool at Kim's in Medford.  What a treat!  If you are ever in the neighborhood and looking for great Chinese food, stop on in!"}
{"text":"This place has good tasty Chinese food. The service is friendly. Take out is available. They have alcohol/drinks available for dine in, although I didn't care for any I've had here. Would be nice to have typical restaurant hours. Especially on the Saturday afternoon. It's casual place to dine. We would visit again."}
{"text":"Poor quality chicken.  Everything tasted like dirty dish water. We paid our bill and left without eating."}
{"text":"Good place to good when your looking go for a casual Chinese dinning experience,  A wide variety with good prices."}
{"text":"Several years ago I ate at Golden Phoenix.  They had the best garlic shrimp ever - a huge platter full of big, plump, juicy shrimp with a tasty brown sauce.  So I ordered some today along with some sizzling rice soup.  The rice didn't sizzle when I added it to the broth, and the broth was flavorless, save for a little hint of soy sauce.  The shrimp were small, dry, overcooked, and tasteless, and the container was half full of sauce!  The sauce wasn't bad, but I didn't pay $10+ for a container full of sauce.  I will never go back there again, and I am trying to spare others from this miserable take-out dining experience."}
{"text":"Worst food... Chicken lettuce wraps taste like rotten fish. Took one bit a spit it out! Even heard a kid at another table eating the same thing say, \"mommy is there fish in this\" dumplings were soggy and tasteless and the sauce had to much onion and oyster sauce. The vegetable chow mien is really just poorly made lo mien. Very runny sauce no flavor, did not taste fresh or properly prepared. To top it all off the bill was 24.50 an I gave her a 20 and a ten. She said \"Ohh 50 cent an I do not have five maybe you just wait?\" haha wait for what another table to leave? You are crazy!! I'm sticking to china chili..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as it is close, and was recommended by friends. Sadly we won't be going back. We ordered takeout and it was mediocre at best, and inedible at worst. Eggrolls were soggy & tasteless, sweet & sour chicken was rubbery, fried rice was bland. The duck was ok, and the best dish was broccoli & oyster sauce. My wife suggested I toss out the leftovers, but I wasn't about to chuck $43 worth of food. I heated up leftovers for  lunch today, and the chicken was literally inedible. The rest of the dishes weren't much better. I now have a miserable lump in my gut and the rest of the leftovers are in the trash. My search for good, local Chinese food continues - so far China Bamboo on 16th is the best but still not that great."}
{"text":"Walking in on a whim for a nice Chinese dinner we were immediately met with the sound of a Chinese zither being played by a young woman.  This only further accentuated the amazing decor that reached from floor to ceiling.  Just amazing.

The service was impeccably attentive, the food was phenomenal and the live zither music perfectly capped off the whole experience."}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese and terrific hosts! Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was fresh and very tasty. Live the egg rolls and mar far chicken. So glad we heard about this place. My new favorite Chinese!"}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food in the valley. Great takeaway. So far have not had a bad meal"}
{"text":"Attempted to enjoy lunch today. Unfortunately, I DID NOT.   As we pulled up, the sign on the door read \"CLOSED, Out of Business\".  Horrible news!!!  I loved this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I, along with another couple, visited the Golden Phoenix a few weeks ago; we shared the Mandarin Dinner.  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere was awesome.  Food - not so good.  One thing we noticed - just about every item of food was fried!  Certain items are expected to be fried, such as the chicken wings & the egg rolls on the Pu Pu platter (btw - very bland!).  But the Beef on skewers?  Fried to the point of toughness that I couldn't even chew it.  Worst of all, they do not put knives out as part of the place setting, so you cannot even cut the tough meat they expect you to eat.  The one saving grace to the entire meal was the Mu Shu Pork, which was very tasty with the condiment of dark, rich plum sauce.  The entire dinner was quite plentiful, and we had a lot of food left over, but no one wanted to take it home.  Sad, as this restaurant has been around for 35 years; we probably will not be back.  Two stars for the great atmosphere & service."}
{"text":"This is a place which has earned it's 3-star rating from Yelp.  I had lunch there today, and while it didn't entirely suck, it's not a place I'll likely revisit.  The hot-and-sour soup was a little gelatinous and not very hot or sour; the egg-rolls were mediocre; and I'm pretty sure they served me last night's ribs for my appetizer.  But the entrée of kung-pao shrimp was actually pretty tasty; the hot tea was good; our waitress was attentive; and it was a very cheap lunch.  

On second thought, I guess might go back if I ever want to feel like I'm in the opening scene of an Indiana Jones movie. There's enough garish Chinese décor to make one feel as though one were in a 1950's movie about China, and it gives the place an ethereal quality I haven't seen at too many Phoenix Chinese restaurants.  I'm never ordering the ribs again, though."}
{"text":"What a disappointment over cooked not fresh and rude old lady  over charging for slop"}
{"text":"I've been having a hard time finding great, greasy Chinese food in Phoenix. I have my favorite spots in Tempe, Scottsdale and even Tucson, but in Phoenix I've had no luck. It's funny, I'd expect Phoenix proper to have the best Chinese food out of at least the metro area. But no luck. Uhh well. 

Anyways, The Golden Phoenix looked like it was going to be a winner. Good decor and ambiance for a Chinese food restaurant, large menu, great reviews and located in a strip mall (that's where all the best ones are, I'm sure of it).  Sadly, it wasn't as big as a hit as I had hoped.

Ambiance: Great for a chinese good spot
Take-Out Service: Eh. I called it in, they said it would take 15 minutes but it ended up taking about 25. When I walked in I was given a cold look by the waitress and pointed to the hostess stand. This could have been because I was wearing sweatpants and a baggy tee, but in my defense,  I had literally just gotten a root canal. Who dresses up after a root canal? 
Price: Pretty fair. $20 for an appetizer, soup and main dish. 
Food: Crab puffs: DELICIOUS. Perfect texture.  Soup: Not what I expected, but pretty good. I got the egg drop soup. Main Dish: I am a vegetarian so I got the black mushroom and bean curd dish. I think my ordering skills may have been the problem because who orders a dish of all mushrooms? It tasted, well... really, really mushroomy.  And not in a good way. It was kinda gross. I couldn't finish it. I know this doesn't make sense b/c I ordered a mushroom dish so I should expect a mushroom taste,  but there was some kind of funk going on. And there were no other flavors in the dish, just mushroom funk. The tofu, however was cooked well. 

Overall, the meal was alright, but kind of a disappointment. I feel this may have been my fault for ordering such a weird dish, so to be fair, I will try it again and let you know what I think. 

Just learn from my mistakes, don't order anything mushroomy."}
{"text":"Food was really good and so was the atmosphere. The menu is very authentic and the service was ok. But after the meal I used the restroom and was very grossed out. I will not go crack because keeping a facility clean is most important."}
{"text":"Not fantastic, not terrible. Just the same old every day Chinese food that you expect to find in southern Oregon.

The crab Rangoon were unlike any that I've ever had before. They had full (imitation) crab, large onion chunks, and very little cream cheese. The wontons had no filling at all. Those were quite disappointing. 

The restaurant was uncomfortably quiet. All of the other diners were elderly couples, we were the only ones with children. It certainly amplified everything that they said. The owner was very kind and gracious though, talking with them and making sure they were happy with their food. 

I've heard that you get better food and service the more you go back... but I don't think we will try again."}
{"text":"I remember back in the day when thus place was the place to come sun's player ate here politicians any one of status all good thing must come to a end kinda like Durant's things once was so good now not so mush I had the crazy chicken it was good but not hot at all so I was a little disappointed it that and had way to many bamboo shoots wife had the mongolian beef she thought it was her new favorite over all the food was good better then most in the Vally the service was grate but there wasn't any one in there the only off-putting thing was the smell I don't know why any time you go into a older Asian restaurant they all have that same smell it one a damp cave like a moldy smell other then that it a good place"}
{"text":"Great food, large portions and extremely friendly service. This was my family's first time eating here and it certainly won't be the last time."}
{"text":"Nope.  For $60 we got egg rolls, crab rangoon, wonton noodle soup, mongolian beef, orange chicken, pork fried rice and white rice.  I had a review about each dish and took it off. I will just say none of the dishes was anything we would even keep for leftovers."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but unfortunately we won't be coming back. We ordered the basics to test this place out. We got the orange peel chicken and beef chow mein. The chicken was crispy, orange flavor comes through but not enough for me to want to come back. The beef chow mein was way below average. Thenoodles were mushy, reminded me of overcooked spaghetti. It did not look appetizing, we took a bite and that was it. They give you a big bowl of white rice, also of poor quality and texture. I will say the ladies who waited on us were on the ball, you take one sip of water and they're already rushing to fill your glass. The interior of the place was almost too dark for a restaurant."}
{"text":"I use to go there with a friend and her family and order the sizziling rice soup that was to die for but hadn't been for years recently in the last year or so went back and had dinner with my boyfriend..it was good not great. I did however have my first taste of sake it was excellent mixed with the hot tea."}
{"text":"They have been my only personal source for quality Chinese cuisine for over 15 years. This place is like my Chinese version of Cheers. :)

The service is outstanding and for the price you have an outrageously bountiful selection of amazing food. All of which is exquisite. My favorite thing on menu has pretty much been the Beef Egg Foo Yung. I need it to live!

The atmosphere reeks of class from its ornate exterior to the gorgeous interior. My only gripe is that they're closed Mondays and that is usually when I need them the most.

They're a lot of fun on Friday evenings when they have live music and they've got some massive event-friendly areas in the back which are frequently utilized by professionals for productive meetings over great food. 

I like to take clients and friends here often. It's simply the best restaurant experience I have ever had and it has long become the yardstick by which I measure other restaurants."}
{"text":"I have ate here several times and it has always been good.  A great place to stop for a sit-down Chinese meal in a real asian decorated environment and just some strip mall place with cheap trinkets for decoration.

Food is flavorful, price for meals tonight for three people was right about $30.00, good portions, and fast service. Worth a stop if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Chinese in town.  Very friendly and accommodating.  Love the pan fried noodles and the veggie egg rolls.  They make a killer sweet and sour sauce.  I'm originally from the bay area and had been very disappointed with the local Chinese spots before finding the golden phoenix."}
{"text":"OMG... I'm begging you... Please don't!  I don't normally write restaurant reviews, but I have to for this one.  My husband is half Chinese and we are always looking for a good Chinese food restaurant which in Phoenix, is hard to find.  After seeing the reviews were pretty decent, we thought we'd give it a try.  The egg drop soup was terrible and loaded with celery...  the pork fried rice was musty and dry...  we had a chicken dish and a spicy green bean dish that were awful as well.  We hardly ate any of the food and when asked if we wanted to-go containers we lied and said we were just visiting so we wouldn't be able to keep the food.  Don't waste your time or money!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So sorry to report. One of my favorite AZ Chinese restaurants doesn't quite dilevery anymore.  Sizzling rice soup is still the bomb but had to wait for 40 minutes to have it delivered and then another 40 for our poo poo platter. Beef skewers were good but over cooked and egg rolls were so greasy had to wipe my face withel every bite. Hope they can turn it around."}
{"text":"The general tso's tofu was pretty good. It wasn't on the menu but I asked if it could be made and the server said yes. I asked for it to be crispy which is something that usually isnt done with tofu in Arizona and they it made crispy for me. The portion was big which was good to see for once in a chinese restaurant that isn't in New York City. Usually I get really small portions anywhere else. It was worth the $8.40. My only complaint is they added sesame seeds to the tofu which I didn't ask for but it still tasted good. The server was really nice and knowledgable. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"So very disappointed in this place. Very weird experience. I have never witnessed an owner run off customers until now. A party of 5 came in and they wanted only soup and rice. They told the owner they were not very hungry. She tells them they have to order more food if they were going to eat at her restaurant, she said the restaurant was too busy for them to take up the table and eat only rice and soup, so she had them leave. She was very short with them. Of course no one else came in to sit at that table, so she lost $$$ she could have made off the rice and soup. 
Also our table felt gritty and so did the squeeze bottle of pink sauce. Don't know if I'll go back in, I will order food to go."}
{"text":"Yummy! After checking Yelp for local Chinese Restaurants I found the Golden Phoenix, highly rated and close to my home.  Ordered their Mongolian Beef and was very happy with my order. It was ready in 10 minutes,the veggies were fresh and cooked to my liking. Had enough for 3 meals. Highly recommend, I will be back."}
{"text":"Historic place and dishes.  Haven't been here for years.  The dishes and prices are on the small side so you can order an extra dish and have more variety."}
{"text":"Todays dinner was wierd and unusual. I wouldnt say absolutly unpalatable. We got through it. Walking in was like a scene from Rush Hour. My husband and myself ordered the Mandarin dinner for 2. To start, it came with Sizzling rice soup. The broth was OK.  It had assorted proteins ranging from shrimp to beef to Lord knows what. It was mystery meat. Something did not have the texture of chicken, it did not taste like chicken and it sure did not look like chicken. Thats what threw me off for round one. The crunchy rice they throw in the bowl tastes like puffed rice cereal. 
Next came our Pu Pu Platter. It had Chinese chimichangas (eggrolls), the filling was super peppery ground beef, super soggy and no vegetables Something I would think to find at filibertos. Next up on the platter was ther Crab ragoon. (crab and cheese filled wontons) The wonton wrapper was pretty decent. The filling was  literally a cube of Philadelphia cream cheese with a few chives. The honey chicken wings were pretty tasty. Im glad those were there to lighten the mood. Then up next were the fried wonton wrappers. They were whole wonton wrappers with what looked like pork jerky on the very bottom corner. Fried. That is all. It also had 2 beef skewers ontop of an open flame. Great presentation and great flavor. Lastly was the sweet and sour shrimp that was really good actually. 
So on to our meal. The meal came with Chef special,beef and broccoli and fried rice. The beef and broccoli was mediocre, but nothing much to say there. The \"fried\"rice was just rice with soy sauce. Still okay. Now to this chefs special. It was breaded fried chicken with some kind of sweet and sour sauce, green onions and almonds. Flavor was alright. But geting down to the meat itself. I was a bit confused. If i am eating chicken I should not have to be convinced I am eating chicken. We made it an early night. Coming from scottsdale, Yummy Yummy I know you'll never let me down."}
{"text":"The place was not very busy . Dimly lit. We started with moo shu pork which was good.  . We then had spicy chicken wings which was sweet and not too spicy but was flavorful.  The low me in was too saucy . King pow chicken was a little salty."}
{"text":"I have tried the food 3 times and the last time was probably my last. I always have take out. I cant picture eating there because its not very inviting. I will start by saying the the pork fried low mein was very good, I like that there were bean sprouts in it. But unfortunately the rest of the food is just too heavily doused in oil for my taste. I can smell the oil as Im driving home with my food. I was super excited to see they make egg rolls like you get in SF, big and chewey.....but my first bite was just so oily I couldnt eat it. If you order something like sweet and sour chicken make sure you get plain steamed rice to help lighten up the heavy batter covering the chicken."}
{"text":"After going here for the past 8 years or so the quality has gone down significantly. For the 5th time I ordered the \"happy family\" and they go away then come back 10 minutes later and say we don't have squid, tonight they didn't have squid or scallops so why bother the offer to do all Shrimp (and probably charge me for the regular version. 

I have found this true of the duck, I order it they go away for 10 minutes and come back and say no-duck. I go to Chinese restaurants for the variety and get away form Pork, Chicken and beef.  The Mai Thai's get weaker each time I go to, it was just fruit juice and not very good. 

So tonight was it, no more Golden Phoenix! 

Take your chances on this one folks."}
{"text":"Chinese comfort food at it's best!

There's nothing on the menu here to make you rethink American style Chinese food.  Nothing to say WOW about...nothing to make you call your friends and brag about the amazing culinary find.

This is my favorite place when I just want comfortable, relaxed, I know just what I am gonna get Chinese food.

The place is always clean.  Service always prompt and friendly, food always fresh, tasty and well portioned.

I am lucky to have two such restaurants in my area, and I alternate between the two.  But Golden Phoenix stays closer to my heart - it just feels more like \"home.\""}
{"text":"Once again, tried this place based on other reviews and I am sadly disappointed. While there isn't any excellent Chinese food in Southern Oregon, this is among the worst I have tried so far. The curry shrimp was inedible due to mega amounts of Allspice - it was like the chef accidentally dropped a whole jar of Allspice into the dish and said \"oh well.\"  The menu is uninspiring - they don't even have Mu Shiu or honey walnut shrimp - they stick more to the Americanized versions of Chinese food, like sweet and sour everything, Kung Pao and fried rice varieties. My go-to Chinese restaurant is still New China in Medford. At least there I know that I can get a good honey walnut shrimp dish with a side order of sesame balls, and with enough imagination I can almost pretend I am in SF. ;-)"}
{"text":"Well-- I don't like being rushed to order. The food was ok. I'm going to stick to my China Chili.  Sorry we came here today.  :0/"}
{"text":"We come here often and the owner remembers what we liked previously so she suggests certain selections. Anything on special is awesome especially when green beans are fresh. The portions are large, seasoned just right. Lots of meat and veggies but the tofu is great too.even the portions of the sr meals are more than you can eat."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I went to the GPCR because we'd heard from someone that it was very good.  It was sort of a mixed bag.  The service was good.  Wait staff spoke English and were quite competent.  Atmosphere was very impressive.   We had an appitizer of eggrolls.  I had sweet and sour pork and my wife had cashew chicken.  The egg rolls arrived and the presentation was lovely.  They were a bit overcooked but cooked in a very heavy tasting oil that covered up the taste of the egg roll.  Perhaps the oil had needed changing.  Perhaps it was the wrong kind of oil.. it certainly wasn't light tasting.  Anyway, it covered up the taste of the egg rolls.  The sweet and sour pork arrived and again the same thing.  The pork was cooked in the same heavy tasting oil that smothered the taste of the dish.  The sauce was the same sauce as that which came with the egg rolls.  The whole dish cried for something to carry it above the grease taste.  I used a lot of salt trying find some way to save it.
My wife's chicken cashew came and because it wasn't fried in grease, tasted alot better.  She felt it was very good although a bit bland.  We both decided that there were too many other restaurants in the area to give this place a second chance.  We both decided that decor deserved an A+.  Service deserved an A and food quality was between a C and an F depending on what you order."}
{"text":"I've been going here almost all my life. The owner always recognizes me and remembers what I eat. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Golden Phoenix is the golden standard their spring rolls are delicious, the crab puffs are phenomenal, my girlfriend and I stopped by for lunch the portions were good and the price was great. She ordered the spicy General Tsao chicken which was amazing really good flavor, I ordered the Sze Chwan Shrimp spicy and it was great she also had a glass of wine for under 20 dollars, great quality for a really good price I highly recommend going there for lunch."}
{"text":"The service is fast and efficient, but don't expect a high level of friendliness. The prices are great, but they do lack vegetarian options. I had about three menu item to choose from and went with the kung pao tofu. The spice level was incredible, and the veggies were cooked extremely well. My tofu didn't seem cooked at all. At least give me a little sear on it! My friend devoured her platter, but my fiance and I both had enough food left over for another meal. Hooray for ridiculously large portion sizes! I wish they offered more beverage options vegetarian options, and a slightly more welcoming atmosphere, but it's a perfectly ok restaurant for when you need standard Americanized Chinese food."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is ALWAYS good.  The staff is friendly and attentive. My favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I are just leaving The Golden Phoenix, and will never return. It's my fault. I was hungry for Chinese food and it was too late to go to Noodles and Rice- which we really love, for lunch! I ordered Orange Chicken w/white rice: not enough sauce, chicken was tough, hard, and void of flavor - all for $8.95! My husband had Chicken Chop Suey - not much flavor, but it was ok. DON'T PLAN ON A RETURN VISIT"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese food, not particularly noteworthy but not bad. I get the feeling this place has been here forever, the place has an old feeling to it. Might stop in again."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, a bit out of our way, but we are on a mission to find a really good Chinese restaurant in the Medford area.  It was just ok.  I ordered orange chicken, fried rice, spring roll.  My husband ordered mar far chicken, fried rice and crab cakes.  Most items were ok, but the fried rice was really just ok, not so flavorful."}
{"text":"Golden Phoenix is the kind of place you visit when you want a decent, inexpensive lunch. The place is rarely full during the week, especially if you arrive closer to 11am, so be prepared to eat your meal while the (slightly creepy) waitstaff sits at a nearby empty table and watches you eat.  The food is nothing spectacular, but it's decent quality, flavorful (although \"very, very spicy\" is really closer to \"my tongue has a slight tingle\"), and dirt cheap.  Today I paid $16 and change before tip for myself and my friend, including soft drinks.  I'll keep coming back for the reasons I listed plus its close proximity to my office.  You can't beat a good deal!"}
{"text":"It's okay, esp. if you get a lunch special. It's just your average to good/okay Chinese restaurant.  The food comes fast, with free tea, (very good stuff,) and soup, white or fried rice, your choice, and an egg roll and these awful fried won tons. Not a fan of those in any restaurant, just fried fat and white flour and salt.  (that's the lunch special.)  There is a huge variety of choices. Then they usually have a special or two every day.  You can request without salt or steamed if you like.  If you are awkward with language barriers, they seem to do okay here, although English not the first language. They are friendly and service oriented.  The take out is great, too.  Try the duck rolled in a crepe.  Great sauce and lots of lean protein.  Pretty clean, too."}
{"text":"I've been eating at The Golden Phoenix for about 18 years (since I was a kid) and I still love it.  Its family-owned, friendly and the food is always good.  I've never been for lunch, only dinner, so I can't speak of some of the not-so-good reviews it gets for lunch.  My boyfriend says its Meh, but maybe the kid in me still likes to look at the fish tanks and remember when I was just a little girl and this was my family's big-fancy-dinner-of-the-month spot.  I still love it.

(I only like white meat, so I appreciate that they only use white meat chicken, if that's not authentic, then so be it.) 

They have live music on certain nights and its wonderful.  They've never gotten my order wrong in 18 years, sit down or carry out, so that's saying something.  Service is 5-stars. Clean as can be. 

to reviewer Bill:  Are you saying its a BAD thing for a restaurant to be owned by the same people and ran the same way for 30 years?!  I'll tell ya, Lucie's & the Vig will be long gone (hint: they suck) and TexAZ and The Golden Phoenix will still be there.  There's good reason for that - a solid meal and a solid price and a well-earned good reputation. That's a GOOD thing."}
{"text":"I have been going here since 2004, I used to order from their lunch menu because it was inexpensive compared to their other entrees.  Let me tell you, if you want their best food you don't order from their lunch menu.

It's completely worth paying a little bit more for their really good food.  My favorite is Peking Beef served with crunchy noodles and green onions.  I've had other stuff on their entree menu.  But with food I know what I like and I don't want to mess up a good thing.

The owner always remembers me and since I'm independent a bridal gown designer she always asks what new gowns I've made and takes the time to sit and talk with me when it's not so busy.

I love this place, I love supporting these great owners so much that every time I'm in there I buy fortune plants they have on display / for sale.  Maybe that's why my business is flourishing and my marriage is happy - just kidding.  : )"}
{"text":"This is my go-to happy place. Quality is always great. Love the Mu Shu (crepes) and plum sauce. The Mai Tai was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I love Chinese food, even most \"bad\" Chinese food, but this was too much for me. The cool exterior drew us in, and the inside decor didn't disappoint. Everything from the ceiling tiles to the fish tank to the Chinese zodiac place mats were right out of central casting.
Unfortunately, the mu shu chicken was mostly under seasoned onions and cabbage with over cooked meat. It was still more tender than the sinewy beef in the fried rice, which was borderline inedible. Only the shrimp with green beans was a solid dish. 
The service was good. (They rolled all 4 my shu crepes.) The prices were reasonable. Still, I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're desperate for Chinese dining."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place ever! I have been going here my entire life and the staff is always so nice and food is fantastic!!!! Never will go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a small child, it's a family tradition. I am a HUGE fan of their pupu platter and their sizzling rice soup. The pupu platter has wings, beef skewers, egg rolls, crab puffs, and won tons. The beef skewers are my favorite, always crispy and a little salty goodness. The sizzling rice soup is out of this world. The broth itself is a complexity of flavors that burst in your mouth. The rice is crispy yet soft, there is everything in this soup, from tofu to shrimp to veggies. Order it and prepare for an experience from the moment the rice gets dropped in and the sizzle starts. The rest of their menu is a hit and a miss. Just depends on what you like. Decor is extremely divey and dated, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Love their food! Place looks a bit sketchy from the outside, but give it a shot, it's worth it! their crab rangoon is really good, not like any rangoon I have ever had before! Their fried dishes (rice, mar far, etc) taste fresh and do not have that burnt oily taste i've encountered at a few other local chinese restaurants. My only complaint is that if you order soda, it comes as a can, and is not freely refillable. That is not a huge deal to me, so I keep coming back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I WOULD I went there for lunch with some friends and the lady was so incredibly RUDE. At first it when we got there it wasn't so bad. Once we where ready to order it got to the point where we couldn't stand it. We left before we could even order because she was so rude. I will not be back & I would NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Being from NYC & LA I suppose I need to adjust my expectations but for the $11 - I expected white meat chicken. They get an \"A\" for effort in presentation but everything was off. Egg rolls contained minced meat, etc. 
staff is very pleasant and helpful and I will give them another chance."}
{"text":"To say it wasn't mediocre is the best I can say. Flavorless, beige glop instead of yummy sauce. I cannot understand the 4 star ratings."}
{"text":"One of my favorite foods in the world. They know me here as \"2 order crab puff\" yes both orders are for me... A great place with great people that I've been going to for 10 years now. I love the sesame chicken and the orange chicken. I've had everything from duck to desert. Come here with the family and get some yummy food today!"}
{"text":"Don't take this as a negative review.  The owning lady and her cooking husband are lovely people who put a lot of pride in their restaurant.  The food is perfectly good but there is nothing special here.  It tastes like virtually every average Chinese restaurant I have been to.  Still, it's solid and won't disappoint you but don't expect extra freshness or super high quality meat or fish.  This is a pork fried rice and orange chicken kind of place."}
{"text":"The food here is hit or miss. The food is either really good or hmmm not so much (but maybe that is more personal taste than actual critique).

Personally I love their Kung Pao Chicken because they have the most peanuts of any that I have ever had and the brown chile sauce has just the right amount of spice. They serve a decent bowl of Sweet & Sour soup. The Mongolian Beef is a reliable contender. And they have very reasonably priced lunch specials. 

Aside from the food, I have one other criteria for Chinese restaurants... When you are sitting in a booth, the walls should not be covered in little dots of decaying bio-matter. I should not have to guess what rotting sauce is spread across the shell-inlay-ed picture of a woman carrying water over a bridge. Golden Phoenix passes this test. Not to mention that I don't think they have ever made the Dirty Dining report...

Overall, they are a better choice than some of the options in the area and if you are in need of a party spot, they have a reasonably sized private room for such an occassion."}
{"text":"Waited over 40 mins for delivery half a mile away. Food was very bland def go panda express before here again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner tonight! The mar far chicken was really good. Instead of little chunks of chicken, you get huge pieces of chicken. More protein!!!"}
{"text":"Canned soda, bland food, 1 out of the 3 egg rolls we ordered were burnt so badly we couldn't eat it and it was 7.50 for them! The breading was way too thick. I gave them one more star than I would because of being MSG free but rather than that we were one of two tables there on a Saturday for a reason. PASS on this place."}
{"text":"Was greeted by host and sat quickly. Waited 15 minutes and no one greeted us. No water was even brought to the  table. Left the restaurant as there were several tables also waiting to be served. Have no idea how the food is."}
{"text":"This place has been here as long as I can remember.  I have replace the not-so Super Dragon with this place, and I'm happy I did.  The quality is good, service is good and friendly (unlike Super Dragon) and its easy to have an enjoyable meal here."}
{"text":"Sorry but I will not be returning. I belong to a networking group that meets once a week. We have been  to this restaurant for the last 3 weeks. For the food.. Not Horrible but sure not the best Chinese food. It looks like the same specials on the chalk board for the past 3 weeks. Average food at best. So here is the story behind the 1 star. One of our members is on a very strict diet and she shows up to our meeting and usually doesn't eat. The server basically embarrassed her by reminding her that she did the same last week and did not order anything. A few minutes later, the server approached her and told her that she needs to make sure to tip even if she doesn't eat. I'm sorry, but just not sure why the server would think that was something nice to say. I would say it had a negative affect. I'm sticking with a 1 star. When rating any restaurant, I believe that service is huge!"}
{"text":"Not really the best Chinese food, but the Kung Pao Beef is the most amazing I've ever had. Disclaimer: I grew up eating it - Golden Phoenix on 16th will always have a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese Food restaurant. I've been a patron for over 20 years! It's an authentic Chinese food restaurant so don't go looking for the highest customer service. Just come and try it out! It's delicious and hits the spot."}
{"text":"I ordered a lunch special to go since I was in the area. Got the house special chicken lunch. I opened the container at the office and the smell was yummy. They give a huge mountain of fried rice, large portion of the house special chicken, 2 fried wontons, and 1 egg roll. I was surprise everything was still HOT and not too bad for American Chinese food. For the amount of food I got, it was very reasonably priced lunch specials."}
{"text":"We ordered food from this restaurant for my son's birthday party. The owners forgot about the order day of the event- due to their neglect, we didn't get the food we ordered, my husband ended up missing 45 minutes of our son's party. The owner did not ask for payment when my husband got the food- so we thought reasonably the food was free to compensate for their mistakes. We do not hear from them for almost 6 weeks then they called our house day and night demanding payment. Oh yes, it gets worse- they ended up suing us in civil court over a bill that was less than $200!! It was a total nightmare experience. Don't have any dealings with this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in a while. The chicken chow mein reminded me of my childhood of my favorite restaurant. Friendly staff to two out of towners on a long road trip. Egg foo young was delicious and the egg rolls were amazing."}
{"text":"Small little \"hole in the wall\" Chinese Restaurant that blows the rest away! The vegi's were fresh and cooked perfect, the chicken was good quality white-meat, and the sauces were rich and full of flavor! Just a short driver from Medford or Ashland...This is our new Go-To when we are craving Chinese!"}
{"text":"Garbage. The absolute worst food, whether or not Chinese. Egg rolls are greasy, no veggies inside. More like greasy tacos. Egg Fu Yung tough, like they mixed flour in it, no chicken. So disgustingly NON Chinese the owners should be ashamed. The General Tsu is so bland and tough. We fed to our dog. STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite a few years now. And it seems I mostly get the same thing - egg rolls! These are pork egg rolls, huge and come in a four. This is one meal in itself and for just under 5 bucks, worth it! Totally different from Wahsun, just as delicious. Sometimes I also get the chicken fried rice - yum!

I like to place my order over the phone for pick up and there always so nice on the phone. The inside of the restaurant is very dark, high booths and decorative. I think the last year they got Wi-Fi, just ask for the password.

They have a little seating area if you get there before your take out is ready. Its right next to a sausage and deli place."}
{"text":"Another love/hate restaurant. I love the restaurant itself and the service is excellent. Food though is not great, looks great but the entrees are flavorless. 

Loved the classy look of this place when I walked in. Nice entrance, nice furniture and traditional Chinese decor throughout. Everyone working there was very nice and took really good care of us. I was excited!

Two of us ordered Mai Tai's. They were pretty good. We had two each to make sure. Food wise we stared out with crab angels (crab puffs), pork dumplings and deep fried prawns. The crab Angels and dumplings were very good, the deep fried prawns were overly battered. The batter was too doughy and took away from the flavor of the shrimp. We couldn't finish them. 

We then moved on to sizzling rice soup. It wasn't bad but didn't blow me away. The broth could have used a little more flavor. 

For our entrees we ordered house special chicken, Mongolian beef and sweet and sour pork. Of the three, the Mongolian beef was the best, but didn't blow me away. House special chicken which is one of my favorites in any Chinese restaurant was just okay, very little flavor. We poured the rest of the sauce that our dumplings came with over the chicken to add flavor. Sweet and sour pork, horrible! Flavorless, not sweet or sour and again doughy like the shrimp. We left almost the entire entree on the plate. 

I really wanted to like this place, but in the end it was a fail."}
{"text":"They had two visible signs up claiming No MSG. 

I got the Happy Family meal for four to go.  It includes:

Sweet and sour pork.  The pork was dry,  with a thick dry fried batter on it.  It was drenched in a very sweet sauce. 

Mar Far Chicken.  Crust was good,  chicken a little dry. 

Chicken chow mein.  I've never seen chow mein with dark noodles,  but it was delicious nonetheless. 

Pork fried rice.  Dry all around. 

Fried shrimp.  Dry batter,  over fried shrimp. 

Spring roll.  Fried perfectly with tempura on both ends.  Mashed potato texture inside. Ick.

THE PINK SAUCE...... need I say more? 

I'll try again,  maybe during a busier time when the food is fresher.


UPDATE:
I am doubting their signs claiming \"No MSG\". MSG is a migraine trigger for me and I woke up with one this morning."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I've had. The service was excellent, the food was hot with  no msg. Super large portion too 
Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and called ahead and placed an order for the Peking duck.  Ordered the full duck.  We arrived and were seated and after a 20 minute wait the duck arrived.  It was bland and also was not a full duck.  Won't be back and if you are looking for sweet and sour pork or chicken or shrimp.... this is your place.  If you are looking for real Chinese food go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about my chinese food, been to over 50 other locations in Phoenix and no one compares to the service, taste and atmosphere than the Phoenix Dragon.  Still going there over 10 years now!"}
{"text":"Old-school American style Chinese food at its best. The decor is straight out of the restaurant in \"A Christmas Story\" and the service staff is similar, as well. 

The kung pao beef is exceptional as is the fried wonton appetizer. Great place to go with a small to mid-size group, as everything is family style and the servings are good size."}
{"text":"Yes. Oh, yes. My travel buddy and I are headed from the Bay Area to Portland. Our 1st time and not the last. Seriously the food is great. It's not like 100 other places I have been. Fresh, moist, flavorful, just simply delish. Crab puffs are crazy good. Just go and enjoy."}
{"text":"The service was great as always! We started off with 3 pew pew platters. And we all shared entrees. The food was great, plenty left over, and we had no room for desert. The hot tea was perfect for a cold evening!"}
{"text":"Good Mar Far Chicken.  Their Mar Far Chicken tasted the same as Kim's with Pink Source.   If you like to eat Fried Rice, order one for yourself. I like the texture of their fried rice. You never can find that in anywhere else."}
{"text":"2nd time back very good food and service. Love the to start out with the egg rolls. Can't go wrong w /Orange chicken and chow mien."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants.  The location, decor, food, service, and prices are all on par.  Give it a try.  My favorite dish is Mongolian Beef."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out because it had so many favorable reviews. Not sure if they were eating different food or if standards are different, but I was incredibly disappointed with this place. I got orange chicken and sweet and sour pork, along with potstickers, spring rolls and rice. Not the most creative order, sure, but I figured this would be a simple slam dunk. The breading was incredibly thick, and the sauces were pretty bland and, on the orange chicken, barely there. I've had worse chinese food, but I wouldn't even rate this at the level of Panda Express. The woman who took my order was very friendly, and maybe some of their other dishes are great, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Here are my Cons for last evening's dinner: 

-Over cooked Egg rolls 
-Server could barely speak English 
-Will not let you get half-and-half anything. I wanted half Almond Chicken, half Sweet and Sour Chicken, wouldn't allow so I chose Sweet and Sour- this was 2 out of 5 stars. 
-Entrees only came with white rice, we had to order a plate of Pork Fried Rice for $4.95 extra, which was greasy and not too tasty 
-Kung Pao Chicken had maybe 3 peanuts on the whole plate 

Sadly, I would rather go to PF Changs next time. Our $80 (we ordered a bottle of yucky Chardonnay) would be better spent somewhere that at least attempts to accommodate our requests."}
{"text":"Did not like the egg drop soup.
Fried rice was ok
Seems like they use the spare parts of the chicken for the dishes very chewy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I ordered pick up by phone. We got two wonton soups. The wonton was flat instead of cone style but still tasted good. The 2 soups were large, we could have ordered 1 to share. We had the fried shrimp which was amazing! I dont remember what mains we ordered but they were good too. It all came out nicely in a box to go with chopsticks and fortune cookies!"}
{"text":"We have not had any luck at finding a Chineese food restaurant since we moved to Southern Oregon. This place exceeded our expectations and we were provided a great experience. What a sweet family and its soo clean too! Not to mention the freshness of the food and veggies! We now have a go to place!"}
{"text":"We were trying to satisfy a Chinese food craving and couldn't think of any place close or that we truly liked.  Don't get the urge for Chinese food often.  Anyway, I remembered seeing the Golden Phoenix the next plaza up from Dick's Hideaway, so suggested we try that.

It worked out quite well!  The place oozes \"Chinese restaurant\" atmosphere.  Like another yelper said, it looks like the set of the place in \"The Christmas Story\".  The staff was very friendly and the food was exactly what we wanted....tasty American Chinese take-out fare.  Had the Mu Shu Shrimp, Chicken Egg Foo Yung, and the Peking Fried Rice.  Everything tasted perfectly fresh and delicious.  The mrs. really liked the plum sauce and I thought that even the soy sauce tasted better.  It had a stronger flavor than just plain ol' Kikkomann's.  Needless to say, we over-ordered.  Ended up with some loaded to go boxes! It isn't the closest place (10 minute drive for us), but when the urge hits us again, we will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Food quality seems to vary quite a bit.  On my last visit, the chicken was dry at best, and the egg rolls were left in oil for too long.  There are better places to go in the area for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Traveling through town I looked for a Chinese Restaurant with a good rating. I found this place and my dad was with me.  He's a picky old man. 

It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the service was great. The place was clean and the food was spot on.  Not one complaint and my old man said you should write a review and tell people how good this place is.  

So here I am.  If your looking for good old fashioned Chinese food.  You will not be disappointed. 

Was not greasy at all and again food was cooked perfectly.  They were busy also."}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup is delicious, it's a large serving size made to share.  I didn't realize it contained shrimp (and plenty of them), next time I will order without - but it didn't give a shrimpy taste.  It had a nice amount of heat and not overly sour.   My h had egg drop soup, he enjoyed it and said it was a little different than what he usually has because it had veggies. The egg rolls are very different, only filled with meat and served on fresh shredded cabbage.  They were quite tasty, very crispy.  I had the chicken lettuce wraps, I requested all white meat.  The wraps were very good, the server puts them together for you table side.  My h had the sweet and sour pork and was very happy.  Everything tasted very fresh including the sauces.

I don't care about the whole snooty \"Americanized blah blah blah\" it's good and that's that.

2 soups, egg rolls and two entrees came to just under $34 we felt it was a good value.  Our server was very friendly and helpful, the dishes came out at a nice pace.  I'm definitely looking forward to a return visit.  It looked like they also get a lot of take out traffic and I noticed there is free delivery for doing a check in."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for over 2 years now and enjoy the food a lot. The chef and his wife run this tiny little restaurant and they work their butts off to make us happy. If anyone remembers Medford's Kim's Restaurant when it was at its peak- this is very close here. In chatting with the owner, we found out that the chef here used to work for the original owners at Kim's and he takes great pride in his food. He uses no msg ever. He has an amazing super high btu burner that makes his wok dishes just fabulous. Caramelizes the rice and veggies but keeps the freshness crisp- and his sauces are fabulous too. I've now tried I think all the different sauces he makes and tonight tried the Peking pork- medium heat. It was awesome . The Szechwan sauces are my favorite. I remember going to Kim's with my family growing up and how special it used to be! I am happy to say that this is my homey replacement."}
{"text":"A group of us went there last evening for dinner.  We had the private room which was very ornately decorated, One person at our table ordered won ton but was told to order this it would be for 12 and they could not make it for just 1 serving.  I ordered chichen chow mein thinking they could never screw that dish up.  it was not chichen chow mein and instead was pieces of chicked with spaghetti and and a light brown thick gravy.  Food was not hot.  Plenty of food for the money but not served the usual way in silver covered containers but on open platters which is also a cause of food getting cold. There was a lack of communication between us and our waitress.  Brought wrong dinners to wrong people and the same with the drinks.
I had been hoping for some good authentic Chinese food as I have never found many here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood Chinese restaurant. The owner is grest and the food is yummy at a good price"}
{"text":"This place is OK. If I don't want to drive the extra 5 miles to the best Chinese restaurant in town (see my review on Desert Jade), then Golden Phoenix is where I typically go. Their food is a little salty and their meats are sometimes a little suspicious but it is clean in there and the service is fine.  Egg foo yong is OK as is shrimp with garlic sauce. I do like their egg rolls and crab puffs. Moo Shu is a fine choice as well."}
{"text":"This week the Jolly Diners headed for the Golden Phoenix Chinese restaurant on 16th Street. Little did we know that this would be such a memorable dining experience. The business was started over 40 years ago according to the staff. At that time it was designed with customary Chinese Interior decorations, and man is it beautiful! It's probably the most beautiful Chinese restaurant I've seen in Phoenix so far. Not only is it a treat for the eyes, but the food is really well prepared, delicious, served with professionalism, and is priced very reasonably. The restaurant is very clean. Families will have a great meal, a great experience, at a reasonable price. My mom had the chicken Chop Suey, my sister the Tofu and Black Mushrooms, and I had Lettuce and Tofu. The lettuce and tofu came on a huge platter and the waitress mixed the Tofu with some special sauce and noodles beside the table before filling each of the lettuce cups with the mixture and serving. It was delicious. If you want a great place, that is beautiful to take a family to, or take visiting relatives, you really can't beat this restaurant if you like Chinese cuisine. Even the outside is decorated just like a place in China. The Jolly Diners unamimously voted a 5 out of 5 and it's well deserved. We hope that you enjoy it as much as we did."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times and its hands  down the best chineese food in the valley. In this area chineese food is often underspiced. Kung pao tofu and zschen shrimp were well spiced and  oh so good! we love  spicy food real spicy food and can rarely find it around here. Friendly and good service and great prices. Love love!"}
{"text":"It's a given that most of us have been in the family style Chinese restaurants in the past, and most of us will remember sitting and finding out what animal you and your friends are on the chinese calendar. Golden Phoenix harkens back to those memories like no other place in town. The service is impeccible, and the owner of the restaurant remembers everyone who walks in the door, and epitomizes great service from a restauranteur. 

The food here at Golden Phoenix is your standard Chinese fair, nothing too authentic, but I hear they have a separate menu they provide to Chinese people. I've tried their Sweet & Sour Pork ($8.75) which was great, and had a very gingery sauce a little different from what I'm used to. Cashew Chickn and Kung Pao Chicken ($8.25) are both good dishes, but lacking in the sauce flavor department. Both dishes had plenty of veggies, chicken, and nuts, but were fairly bland overall. Hot & Sour soup is one of the best I've ever had, and they include plenty of medium sized shrimp, tofu, mushrooms, etc. I've had better tasting and better quality food elsewhere, but the difference is absolutely marginal.

Overall, I'd say this is a great place to go for a good ol' fashioned Chinese/American meal with your family or friends. They have a full bar complete with signature drinks like the Chinese Itch, Zombie, and Typhoon. What makes this restaurant special to me is the sense of familiarity you get from the staff, even if you've only been once or twice, such as the case with me."}
{"text":"I think I'm going to make a list called \"Destined to be Misremembered\". On it I'll list the places in newer neighborhoods that are likely to still be standing 30 or so years from now, with basically the same concept and perhaps even ownership. If I'm still around then--30 years in the future--I hope to still have enough discernment to tell longtime customers who think these places are \"GREAT!\" something like  \"Yeah, it was kinda non-descript back in 2011, and it still is today. You are on a nostalgia trip. Now pass me my Viagra inhaler: I've got a flight to Sexbase 4 on Venus in ten metrons\".

And so it is with many places around Central Phoenix that seem to survive on mere tradition. I'm thinking of places that various old-time Phoenix people I've known talked up to the skies, and were it not for that incredible John-the-Baptist introduction, would have seemed perfectly fine.

There's nothing really wrong with the Golden Phoenix. The decor is swell and campy in that wild over-the-top old Suzie Wong way. The wait staff are attentive to their customer's needs, if not fluent with English. Everything seems clean and relatively well-maintained. And the food is. . . well . . . .serviceable.

This is your father's Chinese food--provided your father is a white guy from the Midwest who didn't travel much. There are hints of flavors like ginger hidden under sauces no more pungent than brown gravy. The hot-and-sour soup is tasty if a bit too bulked up with cornstarch or something. The rice is white and sticky just like it is in thousands of other Chinese places. In fact, Golden Phoenix could be another location of some great over-arching secret chain of American Chinese restaurants that all basically serve the same food. Nothing wrong with that, mind you. It's what people like, and so it thrives.

So I think Golden Phoenix is a great place to keep in mind for an inexpensive lunch. Also, its location near the power corner of 16th and Bethany makes it a good backup choice if the Vig, the Garage, Texaz Grille, Rokerij, Phoenix City Grill, and everything else nearby happens to be too crowded or something.

But \"great\"?"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  For starters, I paid cash for my take out. I was owed back five dollars and was told \" we don't have enough change\". So I had to settle for $2.50. What kind of restaurant doesn't have proper change?  Especially on a Saturday night.  
     The food:  Chicken lettuce wraps had a strange fishy taste. Gave up on them after a few bites.  Vegetable chow mein:  In my opinion, a broun sauce is thick and flavorful. This one was very liquidy and flavorless.  Dumplings were edible at best. 
     Do yourself a favor and stick with China Chili."}
{"text":"Small restaurant, quiet on a Thursday night, clean, friendly staff and really super awesome food! A little out of the way for us but totally worth the drive...we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Always delicious!  The Won Ton Soup is definitely my favorite, but I have never had bad food here.  The Mar Far Chicken is always 100% white meat, and is made in such a way as to not be all breading.  Yes!  The lunch/dinner combos are also good, and if you want to swap something out for another item, they are more than happy to make that happen."}
{"text":"This place is really good they're very nice. (which makes me want to eat there.) They have a combo special for two people and it had coconut shrimp and a couple other items and dessert and it was delicious. I think you should go give it a try you shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One word to describe this place ... AWESOMENESS !!!!!

This was our first visit ... And there WILL definitely be many more.

Our waitress was awesome and any questions we had she was more than happy to answer.

The food ... So good ... I can't describe how great it was ... 

The atmosphere was relaxing ... And made it very easy to enjoy our food ... 

An AWESOME experience in all and already looking forward to the next time ... :-)"}
{"text":"I had the Phoenix special and it was nothing special. No flavor and the meat tasted like it was poached in  water. The egg flower soup was so bland and slimy. The portions were plentiful and the chicken was white meat, which I prefer. The service was OK, I had to wait a while for my check & I was on my lunch break."}
{"text":"Ordered a Mongolian Beef Dinner to go $8.50, large portion, screamed fresh with tender beef. Best we have had in Medford in some time, one portion fed two people."}
{"text":"Food had little flavoring, service was good. I thought the over all price was good but they need to work on flavoring the food. I've been here in the past and keep on hoping to be wowed."}
{"text":"The food doesn't taste like Chinese at all, no flavor , just tasteless, first and last time here"}
{"text":"Have been going here for almost 5 years. The service is always amazing and the food is always hot and fresh. Both the waitstaff and the owners truly care about the customers and ensure you are always satisfied. Everything we have tried has been really good (Orange Chicken, House Chicken, Mongolian Beef, etc.). They are also excellent when you have a large party of if you have to call a large take out order."}
{"text":"Really friendly customer service! Easy parking and a ramp for wheelchairs! Clean inside. About 6 booths and a couple tables. Menus are hidden behind the counter. Kitchen was nice and quiet yet the restaurant was busy with regular customers! I got the #4 and my hubby got the #8! #4 is the best choice with pan fried noodles, mar far chicken and pork fried rice! I say this because the chicken chow mein was gross and had mushrooms and way too many/too large of onions and celery! I love subgum/cashew chicken chow mein but it isnt offered in the dinner combos! :( Mar far chicken was good! Its way different than normal chinese food restaurants! They are large pieces in batter cut up in chunks but very good! The fried rice had pieces of bbq pork, green onions and egg in it but was so bland and tasteless it needed 2 packets of soy sauce from my own fridge when i got home! Normally chinese restaurants supply you with forks, soy sauce, crunchy noodles, sesame seeds, hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce.....but they didnt. :/ They gave us 1 pink sauce and had a sign at the counter charging $1 for extra! Overall I would go back if I didnt feel like driving all the way to our favorite place Silver Dragon in Medford. But it may just be worth the drive since I am on the opposite side of Phoenix to get to East Medford easily anyway. For a small town it's pretty good though! ;)"}
{"text":"This old school establishment reminds me of a Chinese restaurant in a movie. The decor is awesome, especially when you first walk in. I went to Golden Phoenix when I was growing up and I returned there for Christmas dinner this year. As you can imagine, the place was busy and we had to wait (no surprise there). The service was slow, but they get a pass, being Christmas and all. They give free hot tea, but they forgot to give us cups and we were waiting so long, I ended up drinking the tea from a soup bowl (ha!). The food was...ok. I was waffling on ordering potstickers since I saw no mention of them on Yelp but..... they were super tasty, and I would definitely get them again. Their hot and sour soup was lack luster....not very hot or sour. Their kung pao beef was fine, but the beef seemed a little dried out. The prices were a little on the high side. There are other Chinese places in central Phoenix that truly blow this place out of the water, but if you were nearby, this place would do."}
{"text":"I did the online ordering option for delivery and I was impressed with how easy and quick the process was.
The order was accurate and the portions were large. Everything was pretty good. The honey walnut shrimp, fried rice and green beans hit the spot. I didn't love their chow mein. I prefer the noodles to be thinner and to have a little more crunch,it was also a little bland. The only other thing I wasn't super stoked on was their chicken meat. I will admit I'm VERY picky about meat in general  and do not like dark meat chicken at all. Their meat is kind of mixed white and dark. If you don't mind it then you will really like their food. I had to pick it out. 
I'm definitely going to try them again and avoid their chicken options."}
{"text":"Really friendly customer service. When I walked in with my boyfriends little niece, the lady at the register knew her, I thought that was kind of neat. 
The food was \"MONEY!\" as my boyfriend would say, meaning it was delicious!!! We will definitely be back! 
We ordered the #8 combination plate for all 3 of us, plus egg flour soup, sweet & sour chicken, and egg rolls. Mmm!"}
{"text":"Overall rating maybe a 3.5+
Amazing dumplings.  Like 4.5 on the dumplings.

The rest was certainly good, but nothing great.
I think we could have ordered much better.

Will try again as the lettuce wrap things looked fantastic.
They do have a full bar and some good beers and basic hot sake."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years, but tonight was the last night for us. We had a call in order, after 20 minutes we showed up and the owner let us know they hadn't even made our pick up yet.  There was 1 other table. Once we got home we realized it wasn't even our order she gave us.  When we called to have it corrected the owner was rude and did not want to correct this matter. We drove back and got the correct order but the owner was rude when we got there.  What happened to customer service? It has been lost at this establishment."}
{"text":"Weird. I've been going here for so many years that I thought I must have written a review and I came here to update it. Apparently I've been slacking and this is the first time I've reviewed this Phoenix landmark!

Love this place whether for take out or table service. The food occasionally misses, but that'll happen just about anywhere. Overall, the food is great, the prices are reasonable, and the people are quite lovely.

Sadly, it seems that people forget this place is around and after 40 years it may be heading toward an ending sooner rather than later, and that would be a shame. My wife and I were there recently on a weekend for lunch and were surprised to be the only patrons in the place. A few more, including a large group who'd never been there before, showed up after a while, but it was just odd.

Like I said, the food is wonderful and I've always liked the people here. Say \"hi\" to Maria, the woman who usually runs the front, when you go in. But whatever you do, go there. Get take out or dine in, but go! If you have a craving for Chinese food when you're in the central Phoenix area, stop on in and support this local icon. They deserve your continued support."}
{"text":"The gracious owners have made us tomato beef several times even if it isn't on the menu. Ask for it and you will be very happy with it. They will add it to their menu if enough people want it. You won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 25 years and love it!  The food is tasty, even in a take-out situation where there's a microwave involved.  Is it the BEST food I have ever had?  No, but the classic Chinese restaurant atmosphere and family style dining are always a pleasure."}
