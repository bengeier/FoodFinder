{"text":"The Angry Tomato provides fresh, simple food combinations, for a fair price. Bolton is a town overrun with big-box food chains, and the AT (as I affectively refer to it), provides better food for cheaper then Boston Pizza or Kelsey's. My personal favourite, the caesar salad or calamari to start, followed by a chicken club in a whole wheat wrap, with sweet potato fries (the sweet potato fries are mind-blowing). The only downside, if you go during peak times, say 6-7, it tends to get a bit sluggish in the service department. The staff are friendly and at one point I knew one of the owners by name, and has the nicest, coziest environment of anywhere in Bolton."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bang for your buck in Bolton. Excellent food and atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Used the place for a party. Cost over a grand and they didn't even cook it. The entire meal was catered from somewhere else . Then asked me to throw in a few $100 for tips???...food came from some sort of Italian hall or local market . Everyone complained . Thanks for ruining a special day !"}
{"text":"Nice decor. Good bread. But the food was very disappointing. The word that comes to mind is \"bland\". No better than one could prepare quickly at home with a package of pasta and a can of tomatoes. The server was friendly and efficient but lacked any useful knowledge of the menu and specials. Won't be returning to or recommending this establishment."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The portions are somewhat generous (I ordered the 'large' option for pasta), though this seems inconsistent. My partner's blackened chicken entree ultimately wound up being a chicken breast portion roughly equivalent to what was chopped in my jambalaya (and appeared to be the same cut and preparation), despite there being very little else on his plate. This discrepancy in terms of pricing and portions would be a minor complaint if not for the rather surprising corners cut in terms of the food/ingredients.

Rice appeared to be parboiled or at least ready-mixed with dried vegetables and not particularly seasoned. The accompanying sweet potato fries were pleasant, well battered and excellently cooked though somewhat under seasoned and served without any additional sauce. The jambalaya on fusilli was similarly disappointing, though at least satisfying in terms of portion size. The shrimp were clearly cooked from frozen and the texture/taste reflected this. Fusilli was your standard dried grocery fare, mixed white, orange and green noodles slightly overcooked, inconsistently tossed with a bland tomato cream sauce that was spiked with some Cajun seasoning. It was not particularly discernible from standard American-Italian fare, with the exception of the light-handed application of Cajun spice and a few sparse segments of sausage.

Service was pleasant, and the food arrived at our table promptly. This restaurant certainly has potential, but the quality of the ingredients and low commitment approach to seasoning ultimately made for a forgettable meal."}
{"text":"The price is right and the food is decent.  What probably keeps me coming back is the free bread and roasted red pepper dip they serve you!

I'm a regular during lunch and I will tell you my order:
I almost always start with the Corn Chowder; it comes slightly hot&spicy and its full of flavour.  The server even grates fresh pepper and cheese on top of it for you!  And I usually get the basil mayo & chicken wrap - its simply fantastic since the flavours really pop and the chicken is always perfectly tender.

The pizza's are hit or miss... the large pastas are a good portion size; I'd recommend the chicken as the seafood isn't always tender.  The service is also hit or miss and the decor is nothing special... but I'd recommend this place to anyone nearby... it beats the neighbouring McDonalds for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is yummy, the portions are generous, the prices are very fair.
The service is not so great, we were the only people seated and it look us quite a while to get our food.
The atmosphere is very casual, and the deco is nothing special.
If you like flavour and a full belly go here."}
{"text":"The Angry Tomato serves Italian-Cajun hybrid, mostly pastas.  I didn't think there was enough variety on the menu, but the food was good enough to bring me back (I've been twice and will probably go again some day)."}
{"text":"Food is great.  I go there for lunch at least once a week.  Service is outstanding and the pasta is the best"}
{"text":"Great in-town restaurant. Value was great, service was pleasant & the food was enjoyed.

Appetizers: Tried the yummy quesadillas and the calamari which was a little too deep fried for my liking. 

Entrees: My personal favourite was the blackened chicken entree, but I'll probably be back for the sweet potato salmon."}
