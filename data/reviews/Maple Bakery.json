{"text":"Great bakery been going there for years. Not a fan of the front though,however they do have something better...what my colleges and I refer to as the SDT. otherwise known as \"stuffed donut Tuesday or Thursday. Comes in either creamed filled or ricotta. 
Pizza is awesome and best espresso in town. Bread is good too."}

No taste.

Really nothing but taste fresh.
I have lived in the city of Toronto and let me tell you I feel at home when I eat and buy my items here.

Thanks for many years of fresh buns and friendly service.

Cheers..."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about how amazing cronuts are! So I decided to try cronuts at this bakery. It was my first and definitely not the last. I tried their chocolate dipped, cinnamon, and sugar! My favorite was chocolate dipped. I loved how it was nice and soft and flaky-buttery in the inside :)! The only complaint I have is that the bakery only serve on Friday - Sundays. However, good news is you can pre-order them during the weekday :)."}
{"text":"Love this bakery.  Great cannoli. Today I got Tiramisu Zeppole. Good service. Nice staff. Good hot table and I love the pizza slices . Delish  pastries, cakes, donuts and bread. Good small local place."}
{"text":"Best bakery in town.
Best donuts in GTA.
Incredible pizza...
The staff are all sweethearts..
What else? Wicked Black and White cookies... the best in the world whipped creme stuffed chocolate donut.
Great veal... Though I'd like to see a better bread selection..."}
{"text":"Best classic chocolate dip donut I've ever had. Hot table is delicious. All bread is fresh and quality. All other pastries I've had were quite good. I always get their pizza dough and I love it."}
{"text":"This is a Hidden... Italian Cafe, Grocer, Deli, Gelato, Hot Table and Bakery. I wouldn't go to say it's a Gem but more like a Marble. A Marble with it's own characteristics that makes it more of a place for long-time existing returning customers rather than for the new faces. 

New faces go to the newer places with a hip vibe such as St. Phillips or Nino D'aversa while the Maple Bakery regulars like the basic shop format with half the space for baisc dine-in table/chairs. The rest of the shop is of the minimalist as the Breads/Pastries is the more noticeable element here.  Nothing will surprise/wow but all the basic staples are here. 

Where was I in 1983 when this shop opened for business and nearby Wonderland Theme park was just in its infancy? True, the shop is historic but that's quite the opposite from the 3 cute Italian ladies taking care of the whole shop.  First Bakery in Maple is a pretty impressive fact(+0.5 Star).

A lady prepares my Steak Sandwich($5.95) while another takes care of the Cafe and the last as Cashier, but that doesn't mean they aren't interchangeable as they worked like a well oiled Vespa. Mangia! FREE Mushrooms & Onions for Toppings at that price is hard to beat. Load-me-up.  :P

Oh Btw, I've said hidden simply because if you don't drive by them it is quite hidden even from the busy street of Major Mackenzie. You're more likely to have the Coffee Culture across the street from Keele street catch your vision."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fresh, tasty food, polite and helpful staff, and a walking proximity to a huge library, you have found your place. I wish it was cozier there in terms of where to sit. It has a number of really long rows of tables, hence the 4 stars. My son and I came there yesterday, and both wished we could sit at a much smaller table, just the two of us, and chat about the day while eating Maple Bakery's oh so mouthwatering pastries."}
{"text":"this review is for the small cakes alone. bought 6 cakes it was the deal. The tiramisu was delicious. The carror cake..not so good. it had like a reallt sugary water base that is not normal in a carrot cake. the red velvat has too much icing.. it was just more sugar and icing than bread.. i would go back for the tiramisu.But the carrot and red velvet never again."}
{"text":"I grew up with this bakery. I love everything at this place. My fave is the cappuccino and cannoli. It feels old school here which is why I love it but the upgrades with the cash register is an exception. Since moving, I have to come here at least once a week for my cravings."}
{"text":"Seeking an alternative to our usual Sunday morning breakfast place, we checked out this little bakery today.

We had:
Lattes - ordered large but got small, served spilled all over the cup and saucer
Dry bran muffin
Lobster claw was crunchy and tasty. Nicely sized.
Rum ball rolled in sliced almonds was moist and yummy and a nice size.

The seating area was not cozy as another review has mentioned. We both got an unwelcoming vibe from the clientele. When we were finished we went across the street to Coffee Culture to get coffee to go - which says it all."}
{"text":"When I recently visited the Greater Toronto Area, the buzz word was \"cronut.\"  Launched by Ansel Bakery in New York about 5 months ago, the cronut is a hybrid of buttery layers of a croissant & crisp fried crunchiness of a doughnut.  I asked GTA Yelpers Wayne C. & Jennifer K. where to get them, & they directed me to Maple Bakery in the suburb of Maple in Vaughan. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maple-bakery-maple?select=46IGxAXqcmMxhvAH-G0ZTg 

Not knowing how popular cronuts were, I was surprised that they were sold out when I got there. Regular flavors were $3.75 each (sugar, cinnamon/sugar, chocolate or vanilla or maple glazed) & custard cream filled at $5 each. I was told to pre-order, even if it was only for 1 cronut, to ensure that I get one. I then placed an order for 2 cronuts, their most popular flavors being cinnamon/sugar & chocolate glazed, for pick-up the next day. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maple-bakery-maple?select=PjD5pl2i_IoVZy33WbbSmg 

The cronuts were delicious!  The outside was crunchy, & the inside layers were light & airy. The cinnamon/sugar mixture made each bite so flaky delicious, with the cinnamon/sugar crystals falling all over me as I ate; & real dark chocolate was used which made the cronut so creamy and rich chocolaty w/ each bite. Don't know how the taste compared w/ the original cronut, but those from Maple Bakery were very delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maple-bakery-maple?select=l3gNX4Z2FTcaENirE9ujhA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maple-bakery-maple?select=NH3EcNAvy1MG8tv2Pj9kFQ 

But what made the trip to this bakery that was so interesting was not only the cronuts, but that the bakery was more than a bakery.  Opened in 1983, Maple Bakery is an authentic Italian bakery owned/ operated by the Russo Family, w/ recipes handed down by many generations. It started off as a small bakery and gradually expanded over the years to include breads, gelato, sandwiches, hot table, deli, and grocer. In addition to cronuts, some of its offerings, which are made daily, include:

- Fresh Italian-style breads/buns - Calabrese (relating to Calabria, a region of southern Italy) breads, Panini,& many others http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maple-bakery-maple?select=-Kd0sECcx8gJjBQQuNJu1A 
- Custom cakes - birthday, wedding, baptism, baby blocks shower cake, & many others http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maple-bakery-maple?select=slUZqasUrMCjHjLtfNlEuw 
- Cookies - shortbread, amaretti, church cross http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maple-bakery-maple?select=-e_sL53t9iKXJ7GEO_7MgQ 
- Fresh pastries - cartocci, cannoli, & many more http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maple-bakery-maple?select=Fo2cBvVrZGzXQSAN_P4qZw  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maple-bakery-maple?select=CjtrVvSE7Glj4Ld8CSN5Aw 
- Homemade gelato - lemon, hazelnut, chocolate, & more
- Deli - Italian cold cuts (salami, prosciutto, sausages, etc.) & cheeses http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maple-bakery-maple?select=1el8HcJJ9cHdm-VnGUb1GQ 
- Hot table - gourmet pizzas, veal sandwiches, steak on a bun, lasagna, chicken/eggplant parmigiana, & more
- Grocery items - breadcrumbs, oil, antipasto, soft drinks, coffee

There is a dining area where you can have any of the above as a snack or meal w/ coffee. During the 2 times that I was there, it was a homey feeling, as community residents knew each other by name, eating what they ordered, & chatting about the local happenings; there was no rush to be anywhere but here.  A real business that you felt like it was your family. In fact, all of Maple Bakery's employees are either family or long-time employees who know the community well. As the city of Vaughan has a large Italian community, this Italian bakery fills the needs of that community. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maple-bakery-maple?select=X1hEaqqJaTRolJETbeiljg 

I enjoyed the pretty decorated pastries, which I could tell contained real butter & real chocolate. I loved the cartocci (cylindrical doughnut filled w/cannoli cream & chocolate chips) & the cannoli (Sicilian tube-shaped pastry shell filled w/sweet, creamy ricotta cheese filling). No skimping of real ingredients here. Truly Italian!

In trying to decide which pastries to get, I noticed that names of the items were not posted & because I was not familiar w/ Italian desserts, I could only point to what I had wanted; however, as the customers are predominantly Italian & from the local community, they know what they want, & there is no need to post any names to identify the items. (I guess I need to get up to speed.)  

The bakery is located inconspicuously in a small plaza just north of Major Mac on the west side of Keele Street, w/parking available in the private lot.

Maple Bakery not only has Italian baked items, but also has hot food, deli items, gelato, and grocery items. It's also a casual restaurant. And it sells cronuts. Love to go back to try the rest of the items!"}
{"text":"Excellent local bakery with fresh breads, pastries, and a hot table. 

Very good food with the essentials. 
Fresh coffee, and a few items.  

Cakes are excellent here but you need to order in advance. Nothing is ready to go. They have a few frozen cakes made from LaRocca if you need something in a pinch. 

I had amazing coffee and a meatball sandwich at the end of the day.  So I can't  give it a full 5 till I come back and try to see the full selection."}
{"text":"The popular bakery or confectionary in that area is St. Phillips. I have tried St. Phillips and they are not good.
So what about Maple Bakery? 
I respect myself too much to eat something called cronut so I cannot comment on the taste of those.
The cookie and biscottis at Maple Bakery are pretty bad. They taste cheap and unappealing. At best, they have no taste. Mostly, they are just bad. For fresh pastry one has to drive to Garni, but if Garni is too far even a large supermarket like Yummy Market does it better.
The baguette and Viennese buns are good however. You can get them at Sue's Supermarket too. They have two kinds and they mix them all in the same baskets so pay close attention.
With that said, they are not necessarily baked the same day. If you are not careful you get yesterday's. when fresh though they are very nice.
The baguette and Viennese might be good because potentially they are the only things they bake in-house."}
{"text":"Excellent service. They make a really nice cappuccino! 
The biscotti are crunchy, and delicious! 
The hot table is very reasonable with alot of tasty items. Cakes and pastries, bread, and a selection of frozen meets."}
{"text":"Maple Bakery must have a reason to be in business for that long .. 1983... some yelpers not even born yet!! 

The deco though is not as dated.. and interior is clean and organized. 

The bread and sweet selections all looks tempting!! And I just got to pick ONE! 

Almond and Apple Flan ($2.20)
- tons and tons of almond!! Just a touch of apple baked in the filling...
- not too sweet but so flaky!!!
- excellent as a snack and go with a cup of strong coffee

Maple Bakery is small and cozy. A place where people living around the neighbourhood can hang out, pick up decent bread and pastries... I wish my hood has one of this too... Markham Bakery, where can you?!!!"}
{"text":"It appears nothing here is made in house, nor made by the same person. Staff is clumsy; expect flattened pastries when opening box. I ordered 9 items, paid for 9, and opened the tidy box and to my surprise there were 6 items. 

How do you know this place stinks? Well it seems to be run by a cheapskate. The cakes are brought in. Regional health departments don't require them to be frozen, but they freeze them. Most are NOT ice cream cakes and only require refrigeration.

The owner likely suspects they will not sell before they expire. So expect the service to suggest this unnecessarily frozen cake should be left to thaw at least 30 minutes before service. It never smells like baking in there and the hot serve section is devoid of food. Meaning the owner does not want to pay for spoilage.

Many other things are frozen in this place. If you want frozen then go 1.5 km north east to the Walmart frozen food section.

Many things are bland here. It gets 2 stars for providing 8 essential amino acids and a plethora of carbohydrates and some beneficial lipids, and nothing more than that.

Parking is fantastically convenient!!!"}
{"text":"Went to MBakery to try out their Cartocci pastries, they are similar to Canoli, but made with a rounder, softer, doughnut type shell and same ricotta filling. I love them and they are hard to find, so when I saw the pic on yelp, I immediately wanted to get them.

First impression of MB walking in was that the place is mainly focused on their hot table (which I did not try). Customer seating and tables dominated the center of the bakery and I had to either walk though the people seated or all the way around the center tables to get to the cookie/pastry fridges on the opposing side. 

I found the staff polite and helpful during my purchase. Bought my Cartocci, a couple of Canoli and a Strudel for good measure. All was made and tasted fresh,  The flavors resemble what I would call a home style (less sweet) ricotta filling and strudel had some type of cookie sponge in it, The flavors reminded me of something I'd find at my Italian Aunt's house which was home made rather than the sweetness found in more refined creams you find at a \"high end\" professional bakery.  I did not like the sugar rolled on the outer shell of the Cartocci, it was a bit too much at times and seemed like a cheap way to finish such a nice pastry, I prefer icing sugar, it's not as hard to chew on and easier to manage in larger quantities. 

Pastry pricing was $2.75 each for a large pastry which is on the higher end but competitive in the area. Overall, its a matter of taste. I would definitely say they have good pastries and are fresh which is paramount, As far as specific flavors, if you like less sweetness or less refined more home style pastries, you will enjoy their pastries. I would like to go back and try the hot table as this seems to be a big part of their business."}
{"text":"croissants are incredible. if you don't go early in the morning g you may miss them as they go so fast. I always call ahead now and they set mine aside. staff are very nice and always helpful. I usually bring my 4 year old son with me and they are really friendly with him. I like that alot."}
