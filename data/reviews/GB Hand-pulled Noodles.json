{"text":"Authentic Lanzhou beef noodle. Only flaw was the noodle was too thick for the type I ordered, btw, I am a Lanzhou born native so I know what my noodle should look like. Soup base was really nice, radish can use bit of longer cooking time. I had a small, xi noodle, extra spicy came to less than 10 before tip. Servers are friendly, they were busy running around most of the time but still remember to bring me water, woohoo! I would recommend go at 11 or after 12:30, otherwise you might be stuck for 30 min in the lineup."}
{"text":"Very tasty and authentic Chinese noodle shop. There's only one main item on the menu so you know they'll do it well. Cheap"}
{"text":"Place was lined up out the door on a rainy friday, luckily I was able to be seated by the bar as I happened to be flying solo.  You may here the occasional bang from one of the chefs smacking, pulling, and twisting the dough into those deliciously chewing noodles but it makes for quite a show. What a workout it must be to do that all day!  The beef noodle soup was good, the noodles were by far the best part, chewy not mushy or hard. The broth and beef were nothing too amazing to be honest, I mean a noodle soup is still just a noodle soup in the end. The spice level was fine for someone with a rather low spice tolerance like me, so I definitely recommend getting some spice in your soup!  The appetizers looked quite yummy, so I will have to go back for them."}
{"text":"Super good!  Noodles were amazing.  Service was good! Came with the kids and they loved it too!"}
{"text":"favorite ramen place in DT toronto. great value (super cheap if u get mega and share), lots of meat compared to japanese ramen, and super fresh as the noodles r made (handpulled) at the restaurant. love it! (to go isnt as good tho, TRY to eat in)"}
{"text":"So glad this place took over the former Beijing Dumplings location, further expanding the current Asian food domination in the Bay and Dundas W area. This is classic Chinese style hand-pulled noodles. The main menu item is beef noodles, but they do it well. For those who don't know the difference between this and Japanese ramen, Chinese noodles typically favour a clear broth instead of a heavy cloudy broth.   Come hungry: portions are large for the price. Most people will likely be full on a small or large (which is technically a medium because the next size is XL). Small is $7.99, large is $10.99, XL is $12.99. After deciding on the portion size, you get to choose the thickness of the noodles, and then the staff will ask if you want spicy (chilli oil) and/or the coriander and white pepper as garnishes. Each bowl of noodles comes with a few slices of beef and daikon (white radishes). Noodle consistency is chewy and springy in one continuous thread. You pay at the front when you're done your meal.   Appetizers are very traditional Chinese fare: Lanzhou Jam (beef slices in chilli oil), tea egg, and jellyfish in sesame oil. Those unfamilar with Chinese food may find the textures to be too oily or slimey (Chinese cuisine doesn't tend to have dry textured food and if anything is fried or dried, they like to douse it with sauce or accompany it with soup on the side).  Seating is limited to about 20-25 max because it's a small space (not as cramped as Japango but close though). However, service tends to be quick to improve table turnover for people to eat and run. There is usually a line-up at meal times (about 10-20 min wait when it's out the door), but if you make it in the door, you get to watch the chef pull the dough into noodles while you wait. They also offer takeout if you don't want to stay; they pack the soup and noodles separately well enough that it should avoid spillage if you have far to walk.   This place seems popular with people from all walks of life. Most importantly, you know it's authentic Chinese food because Chinese people themselves frequent this establishment (try comparing the ratio of Asians eating here to that of, say, Momofoku if you are wondering what is considered authentic Asian cuisine for good value).  It's a satisfying hot meal, especially since winter is coming. Gave it four stars because it isn't a place where you enjoy the atmosphere and sit leisurely to chat; it is best enjoyed as a eat and run."}
{"text":"The noodles were SO GOOD. Tiny place but seats turn quickly. Probably best for pairs, four at the most. Larger groups would be tough.   No vegetarian options- either beef noodle soup or pork pan fried noodles. Pick your noodle thickness and spice level. These were some of the best noodles I've ever had outside of China. So yummy!!"}
{"text":"Awesome hand pulled noodle spot. Their was a bit of a line, but you get to see the chef making fresh noodles for each order. The sizes of the dishes are very large so it's filling. The flavours of the broth are tasty and the noodles are made well."}
{"text":"Really good noodles for the price point. I went for the small beef noodle with the kuan noodle size with all of the toppings. The broth was flavorful and the chili oil made the entire dish so much better. If you're not sure if you can handle the spice, they have the same chili oil on the table so you can adjust the spiciness to your own taste. The staff were attentive and service was fast. Only downside is that there are only two noodle dishes to choose from. Wish there were more options. Overall, very good restaurant. Left feeling stuffed and happy :)"}
{"text":"Limited menu, but what they do, they do well. Portions are very generous, broth is delicious, noodles are perfect."}
{"text":"Good, clean and fast service. Went there for lunch and was mesmerized by the hand pulling process. Fun to watch while you eat. Good sized portions and prices."}
{"text":"An above average hand-pulled noodle place, imitating the Japanese ramen experience in a good way. Everything in the restaurant are clean and neat and organized. In term of the food, the noodle is 5/5, the soup is 5/5, the beef is surprisingly chewy and on the just edible side, even given it is paper thin. I'd say 2/5.   In fairness after reading most comments, it might be an one-off situation. But given there is basically 1 item on the menu, I expect it to be delivered A+, 100% at times. Anyway, it would be an easy 5 stars otherwise Look forward for tenderer beef the next time."}
{"text":"Good fresh noodles. Great value for money. And for the first time in weeks didn't get rushed out right after our last bite. So great service too."}
{"text":"I ordered a small and it was the perfect size. The noodles were delicious but the broth wasn't amazing. I had to drink a lot of water during my meal probably because of the msg in the broth. It was a good experience overall and I would recommend others to try it once but I personally would not be back."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. Not sure why they would take the time to create such delicious noodles then throw a scoop of MSG in every bowl. Felt nauseous after about 10 bites. Money better spent on some nice ramen."}
{"text":"Walked over a mile and waited in line 20 minutes to be crammed inside like a sardine. In retrospect if I wanted noodles for my last meal I would walk barefooted through 5 miles of broken glass and wait in line for hours to get some hand pulled noodles from this place.  Kind of small and busy but worth it for great noodles and a show.   Simple menu: pick noodle type and thickness, bowl size and spicy level. Add chili oil at table to taste. No frills noodle approach done right."}
{"text":"A friend brought me to experience a new Chinese hand pulled noodle place near Atrium on Bay.  Expect a lineup as the Resto is relatively small; however the line moves quickly.    The food is excellent but menu is very limited.  There are 5 appetizers and 2 mains.    We tried 3 appetizers, all of which I thought were tasty and delish.  1. Spicy cucumber which was very fresh and crunchy with just the right amount of hotness.  2. Jelly fish in sesame oil is one of the best I've had.  Reasonably priced compared to other Chinese restaurants.  It was very 'crunchy' and flavourful.  3. Kimchi which I was a bit surprised to see on the menu but it was as good as any Korean restaurant offering.  The mains consisted of 2 noodle bowls.  1.  House signature Lanzhou beef noodles in soup.  Tender beef slices on a mountain of noodles sitting in clear broth.  2. Noodles with homemade Pork sauce.  Sweet salty minced pork with assorted veggies on a mountain of noodles.  Clear broth on the side.    You may choose from 7 styles of noodles ranging from small spaghetti like to thick flat noodles.  We went with the smallest flat noodle called 'jo ye' as it was recommended by the hostess.    Both noodle bowls were excellent and there were so much noodles we couldn't finish it all!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The broth and noodles here tastes so good and you also get to choose the size of your noodles. I keep coming back because the broth is that good. The portions are pretty big and my only complaint would be that they don't give that much beef (but most noodle places don't really give much meat anyways). It's pretty popular so there's usually a small lineup since the seating here is limited but I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Simply amazing, fresh and incredibly delicious soup! Definitely worth the wait! If you are craving noodle soup this place is a must do.  We both got the beef noodle soup (spicy) with size 3 noodle. Spicy wasn't very spicy but I didn't mind because the broth was so flavourful!  We will definitely be back! Often!"}
{"text":"Don't be dismayed by the line!  You might be jaded after lining up for what seems like hours for Japanese cheese based delicacies nearby, but the line is not as bad as it seems and the rewards at the end justify the means.  The noodles are delicious and filling, and the broth will warm you up on the coldest day.  My only thought was that my noodles stuck together a bit making it difficult to eat without splashing soup all over myself.  I ordered the medium flat noodles.  Next time I'll try a smaller size.  Come hungry, leave happy.   Note - noodle prices have got up $1 compared to the photos of the menus being posted."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite noodle house I've had downtown Toronto. I love the fact that you can choose the size of noodle as well as how flat you prefer to have them. The broth of the noodle soup was tasty and they were generous in the amount of turnip and beef compared to some other noodle houses in Toronto. The one thing I would change the next time I order would be to order without hot sauce (spiciness) since it is an oil based chilli pepper hot sauce and although it wasn't too spicy, it left way too much oil in my soup to enjoy it. Very small grand opening menu but you've got to try their noodles!"}
{"text":"TLDR; get the beef noodle soup, not the pork sauce noodle. The pork sauce is just too salty. The noodles here are very chewy and fresh and portion sizes are worth the price you pay. I always get a small bowl of noodles and it is more than enough to fill me up. there is also a decent amount of beef and the soup is flavourful regardless if you get it spicy or not. It's not a mind-blowing dish, but it is a well done bowl of fresh soup noodles. I've also tried the jellyfish appetizer, which tastes a bit too much like vinegar for my liking. Overall, I think the beef noodle soup is their best dish. The service here is quite fast as well, but the space is small and seating is limited."}
{"text":"Loved the Noodles! Space is crammed so really hoping they expand soon. Really appreciated that free side because I got the vegetarian option. Will definitely be coming back but will try to come during the non busy times because boy does it get filled up fast!"}
{"text":"Basically one main on the menu: fresh noodle soup with beef. There are a few sides as well. Place is small but the tables turnover pretty quickly. The food was good and I will return.   Regarding service, I believe you just wave down any server when you need anything. This is quite common a lot of Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Affordable price. Great and speedy service! The staff are attentive and welcoming. The chef is making the noodles right in front of you!"}
{"text":"Great food, good presentation, well priced and friendly staff, only one item of choice beef but very enjoyable"}
{"text":"Came around 3 on a Friday and surprisingly there wasn't a line up. The staff were very helpful when I asked about the noodle sizes and bowl size (she even brought over a bowl to show us). We both decided on a small so when the good came out we were very pleasantly surprised by the portion size!  For $8 there was plentiful amount of noodles and good amount of beef!  The broth was super delicious and flavourful. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Gosh this place makes me so happy. I've been to Homemade Ramen and Lanzhou noodles, but do these noodles hit just the right spot.   Food (4/5): With a nice clear broth that is neither too strong nor too light, a bit of hot chili oil (by choice, you can choose to add more), the meat, the radish (?), and of course the hand pulled noodles you've got yourself the perfect meal on a cold winter's day. Obviously the noodles are the star here. A fan of the flat noodle variety, the noodles hold together well and are a great chewy texture. They also suck up the flavour of the soup such that each mouthful is flavourful. Also really enjoyed the thin but large slices of radish, really added that fresh kick of crunch between bites! The only reason soup doesn't get a perfect score is the meat. Not a fan of the thinly sliced shank (?). The meat with the clear veins running through it. Would prefer shank thicker and a different choice of meat for this soup.  Cost (3.5/5): okok, the noodles are handmade and the soup is great, however it is on the pricey side. I got a small, my bf got a large and both our meals came up just around ~$27 with tax and tip. We exited full and warm inside, but it's not the most economic choice.  Service (3.5/5): standard and quick. Not much so say here.  Ambience (4/5): mixing it up with asian and english songs, I liked dining in here. It's a fairly small space but you feel like you're in a noodle house. The menu is small (which I like) and thank god you don't hear the roaring thumping of them making noodles (the one downside of Lan Zhou).   Overall, I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place only has two dishes, which I suppose is good as it keeps the menu simple and makes the choices easy - both dishes are pretty good: the dry meat sauce noodles and the soup noodles.  The meat sauce noodles was a little oily for my taste but still pretty darn good. The soup noodles was pretty good fare, filling and the soup was savory - would be great in winter time.  Overall inexpensive and good grub."}
{"text":"Great noodle spot! I love the vibe and friendly service. I forgot what the dish is called but I got the beef with vegetables and noodles. It was amazing, after a long day at work and you feeling asian food come here. Decent wait time for food, knowing that it's freshly made noodles made the wait worth it. My dish also came a little soup which was a good pairing. I tried the soup my acquaintance ordered and found it quite salty which was weird because it looked like the same broth that came with my dish. Maybe it was the meat? The environment itself was ok, when it gets busy it's super cramped. I found the main wooden soup spoon way too big for my mouth. I think that spoon was made for Matt Stonie or Kobayashi. Overall good food, good service!"}
{"text":"Freshly made noodles are delicious. Their small dishes of appetizers are flavourful with sauces you want to take home and make more food with! There are just a few choices on the menu which make the decision easy and the spicy flavour brought me back to China."}
{"text":"Good but my beef had a weird green sheen to it. Not sure if others have seen this before..."}
{"text":"Brand new, but delicious.  Need to work out a few kinks, but try it.  Keep them in business.  They are worth it.  Truly authentic tastes."}
{"text":"Soup base and noodles are sooo delicious, service was alright - they got our order wrong and the place is pretty cramped. Prices are good, wish there was more meat though! Will probably try to come back during a less busy time."}
{"text":"Very busy noodle spot, a lot of people take it to go. Menu is minimal with only 2 options where you get to choose the type of noodle and spiciness. I felt like this was Vietnamese pho with bit of Chinese twist to it. Broth is clear but has a lot of flavor. Restaurant is tiny and you will get bumped into. Great spot for quick lunch though."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is excellent, and decently priced- you can fill up on a meal for $15 or less. Their menu is quite small, which makes choosing what you want super easy. That being said, if you are a vegetarian/vegan, stay far far away, there's really nothing for you to eat here. Both the pork noodles and the beef noodles are excellent, I'd recommend them both, although I like the pork a little more. You can also watch them hand pull their noodles, which is entertaining. The restaurant is really small though- be prepared to have to wait for a seat!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I love how the beef noodles are fresh made and you can choose the type that you want. I've tried a few different noodle shapes/sizes but my favourite is the \"thick\" noodle. It looks like udon but the texture is a little more chewy which I enjoy. The broth is also really flavourful and comforting.   The only down side is the seating. It's super cramped and there were a few times where we had to stand up to let other customers leave. Definitely not good for big groups."}
{"text":"I don't know what is up with the hype. I ordered the soup noodle with the widest flat noodle with no spice. The whole thing was bland. There were a few pieces of meat in there that was just okay. The noodles tasted like dumpling skin. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Delicious noodles with good sized portions. Super cool to see the noodles be hand-pulled while you wait! Not much selection in terms of types of soups, would be nice if they had a chicken or a veggie option."}
{"text":"I liked this place. Got the beef \"sauce\" noodles with the veggies, bf had the beef soup. The beef sauce noodles definitely have more flavour than then soup. Noodles were perfectly al dente.   I would come back and repeat my order- I didn't think the beef soup had too much flavour. I'm sure it would've benefitted from chili oil (which bf omitted). A little \"pricey\" for a cheap and cheerful noodle place, but definitely worth a try if you haven't done so."}
{"text":"Worth a trip if you're in the area!  The portions are substantial and the noodle soup is really flavorful!  The beef jam is even better!  Come to see the noodles made in front of you (you can pick several types) and stay for the comforting, spicy food."}
{"text":"There's been hype over this place. I kept seeing Instagram stories and posts in my feed about GB Hand-pulled Noodles from fellow Toronto Foodies...raving about it.   I'll be honest - I came here with a friend for 2 reasons: 1/ We were in the area; 2/ There was no lineup!  So we figured - why not? Let's give this place a try.  VERDICT: It was fun to select your noodle option/type/thickness. A nice touch of customization. But beyond that, there wasn't anything else to write home about.  SERVICE: The service was ridiculously slow. To be honest, I'm fairly certain they forgot about our order - as I saw several customers who came after us receiving their order. So that was a big fail. A huge pet peeve of mine: If you know that you made a mistake, own up to it and apologize. Don't pretend it didn't happen. That just makes it so much worse. Mistakes happen. But it's how you react to them that matters. Ok, rant over lol.  FOOD: It was meh. The noodles were ok. Nothing special. The meat was good - but the fat wasn't always trimmed off (some pieces had big chunks of fat). Now the broth...that fell super flat. No depth. At all. Note: I should mention that I'm a huge Pho and Ramen broth person... so if you are as well, you'll definitely be disappointed by GB Hand-pulled Noodles. Stick to the authentic Pho and Ramen joints. And let the students and millennial have this place...and lineup haha"}
{"text":"Bad experience.  Pro's: - The noodles are freshly made and they give you a choice of the type and size.  - The broth is good with the noodle soups.  Con's: - The noodle maker is constantly pounding the dough however with such a small space the banging sound just shakes everyone up. My friend jumped out of her seat a few times. Heard a few screams in the background. - The staff are quite rude. I saw the dishwashing guy confront his female cook and accidentally cut her with the cleaver. He was yelling at her... of course in mandarin. - It was quite busy that they were rushing people out. I still had one more dish coming and since they forgot about it they slapped the bill to us. We told them we weren't done.  - They ask if i wanted spicy and I said yes. They came with the noodle soup and a mountain of chilli oil in it. It was waaaayyy too much and i had to scoop it out. I guess that is subjective.  Overall: I'd only go back for the noodles. Not the staff. This place is good for those who have not experienced chinese pulled noodles. But other than that, there's nothing there for me to hold on to.   I wish them all the best but they won't survive."}
{"text":"Walking in to realize it is actually a small diner, the design of the restaurant actually doesn't quite flow, at most 30 customers at a time and I can see servers bumping into each other. The servers are not the best experienced ones as they are pre-occupied with whatever that they have at hands and do not have the flexibility to greet customers at the entrance. Typical sign of asian places, do not expect wonderful customer service but they are polite and hard working.  Ordered the signature noodles (large) extra spicy - very good broth, quite clear, and the spicy level is just the right heat. I absolutely loved the fact that they let you pick the width of the noodles, this means that they hand pull the noodles as you order! I honestly do not think there are a lot of places that can offer that kind of customization and we are talking about downtown Toronto! Not even a lot of places in Markham offers that. I picked \"Flat\" because flat noodles are hard to find. Al dente!!!!!!  Overall 4 stars due to below average of customer service but food is good, price is very reasonable and quick dine in and out. Definitely recommend and will definitely come back for more! Next time I would like to try their apps :)"}
{"text":"4.5   Great tasting hand pulled noodles with a nice bite to it. I got the dry noodle dish with seasoned jelly fish. My bf had the biggest size noodle soup bowl and tea egg.  Service was very good and attentive. Always had water refilled and I really appreciate that cause I tend to drink like a camel when I eat out.   Tea egg - didn't taste any tea just tasted like a hard boiled egg.  Jelly fish - really liked the flavour of this reminds me of when I used to love it at family dinners at Chinese restaurants but a bit more vinegary. Would've been perfect if the garlic was cut back a bit it was a little over powering and left a garlicky smell afterwards. Don't get it if your partner wants to kiss you.   Dry noodles -  I got the 2nd or 3rd largest noodle , could've gone with a smaller noodle. Flavour of the meat and veggies although I would've enjoyed more cucumber to carrot ratio better. Felt like there was too much carrot. It was also a good portion for the price paid. I ate probably 2/3  of my dish and couldn't finish the rest. Btw don't wear white cause you might stain it like I did mines, luckily the material I wore made the stain wash out easily.  Mega noodle soup - bf got it spicy which was just chili oil added. He really enjoyed his noodles and ate all of it.   I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant. Good noodles but can be difficult to get seated/service, especially if they are busy. You can choose how thick you want your noodles and they are hand pulled in the restaurant in front of you. Great choice on a cold day when you want something to warm you up!"}
{"text":"I AM AO HAPPY.  I left with such satisfaction after my meal. And there is no greater feeling.   The food came out fast and hot. Efficient service. Very clean interiors and presentation.   I want to go backkkkkkkkk"}
{"text":"Wow... Simply delicious!   Next time I'm in town I will definitely be eating here again!   The best part is its central location in Toronto!   Usually busy so plan ahead, and honestly if you have to wait it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. As someone who grew up in China eating beef noodle soup for breakfast everyday, my standards are high. BUT this place definitely wowed me. Their beef is tender, noodles are the perfect texture and the broth is incredibly flavorful despite how clear and clean it is. On top of that the service was great and the prices are reasonable.  The only complaint I have is that they have the tables too close together. So when you're sitting at a table for two it kind of feels like you're actually at a table for four with 2 complete strangers.  For those planning on trying this place here are my tips: -For thickness, you can't go wrong with jo ye (the standard size) -For spice level I recommend going with mild because their medium is loaded with chili oil -And just fyi I always order their small and I struggle every time to finish it...so don't hurt yourself by thinking you want an XL  GB is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to eat in Toronto."}
{"text":"Traditional chinese hand-pulled noodles. The soup is really good! Great for quick lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"These are life-altering noodles.  Absurdity aside, these noodles are awesome, service is great, food is delicious - what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but I've been to GB probably 20+ times now, so, it's time. The food and service is good and consistent. I have yet to have a bowl that tasted off nor have yet felt like service was too slow. I will likely return 20 times more. It breaks my heart to see the bad reviews, prob just ppl having bad days. Yea, they use msg, but so do plenty of other establishments. Just don't drink all the soup. Who does that anyway?"}
{"text":"Fresh Asian-style pasta made on the spot. Very inexpensive for the quality of food served. The restaurant is quaint and the service is friendly. It does get quite loud when the chef \"softens\" the dough by \"whipping\" it on the table. Otherwise, a must try for a foodie on a budget!"}
{"text":"You should go here for a meal, but when you do get there early. There's often a line up at lunch, and for good reason! Their fresh hand pulled noodles made on site is delicious. With So many options to chose from( thin, wide, medium wide, etc.)whichever type you choose, it gives the bowl of noodle soup a different texture and twist.   We ordered the shanghai bak Choy as a side, since the noodles don't come with much veggies. That's the only feedback I have, it'd be even better if they served their standard noodle soup with a few pieces of bak choy (2-3 pieces would suffice, I'm not asking for a much). We had the jellyfish too and it's very tasty, just a tad on the salty side, but that's probably  because I shared the dish with only one other person and so ended up eating a lot of it.  the servers are friendly, easy to flag down and refill your water often."}
{"text":"It's a tiny little express style restaurant with very tight seating.  No complaints on the service, rude staff or loudness of the open kitchen - I feel like this shouldn't really be a surprise given the type of restaurant this is. I received friendly service though my server did forget a couple things and needed reminders.  I had the cucumber and kimchi sides, reasonably priced. They were fine. Other Korean restaurants offer the same, but better for free.  There are really only two main entrees you can order: the beef soup or the pork stir fried noodle. You choose the spice level and noodle width. Overall the soup flavour was good and the pork noodles were tasty.  Not overly exciting or highly recommended but worth checking out if you're in the area for a quick bite.  3.5 stars overall."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for the simple reason that their noodles claim to be \"hand pulled\" which sets them apart from the glut of other mediocre ramen places that dot Toronto like the smelly cow turds that lined the Oregon Trail.  I must say, while the noodles were better than usual, their name is a bit misleading. I popped to the back to make a quick stop in the washroom, only to accidentally step into the kitchen where I saw a poor lady pulling noodles WITH HER FEET!   She had no arms, so I must say this is quite a feat of dedication (see what I did there, hehe). While I would normally not eat feet noodles, she did have a large bowl of hand sanitizer that she regularly soaked them in, and might I say, my noodles did have a rather \"interesting\" flavor."}
{"text":"The noodle soup was delicious.  The kimchi was spot-on.  However, I wasn't too thrilled with the spiced cucumber side dish.   Service was friendly and efficient.  I wish I could have gotten the ice water I ordered, however.   They offer either tea or water in the small tea cups... not much room for ice in the glass.  This quaint, cramped establishment offers a limited menu with excellent noodle soup at a good value.  Do not expect comfort, room, or ambiance.  Also be aware that with the space being so limited... it would be reasonable to expect a long wait OR a need to have a backup plan if you can't get in.  We barely had room to squeeze in at 3:00 on a Saturday and others that came after us had a wait for seating.  For a one-dollar-sign ($) restaurant, expectations were met and exceeded = 4*."}
{"text":"Awful service attitude! When you walk in the place 9:40pm on a extremely cold snow day after doing your research on yelp which saying the place will not close until an hour later, the staff did not bother to explain their secret closing time but just shovelled you away saying 'it's close' while greeting and serving other guests as usual. Can't believe how a cozy and warm noodle place just turned this way in no more than half year. Would give zero star if app allows and will never pay another visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic handmade Chinese noodle restaurant near the Eaton's Centre. The noodles come in 6 sizes and are the perfect texture and consistency. The soup is extremely delicious and they give you the option if you would like to add cilantro to your soup.  They have the most simple menu with just two items for the main dishes.   I will 100% be back here."}
{"text":"Quick service | Simple menu | Few seating | Spicy option | Good portion   For under $10 you get this nice big bowl of freshly pulled noodle. You can choose your toppings, level of spice and thinness of your hand-pulled noodles.  Because the menu is a one-pager, it's great for indecisive eaters like me. There's only 3 types of appetizers.   Overall, if you're looking for a hot quick noodle fix, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was disappointed by this place, I believe it is overhyped now that I tried it. I got the small veggie noodle soup and kimchi. Kimchi tasted amazing probably one of the best I ever had at a restaurant. Soup tasted like nothing really, zero flavour even with the chilli oil in it and garnishes. I only ate the noodles which were great. It's cool that you can see them make the noodles in front of you. Also, customer service was amazing.   Pros:  -Great kimchi. -Great variety of hand dragged noodles and they tasted fresh. -Cool that you can see them make the noodles in front of you. -Great customer service!  Cons: -Few menu items. -Soup base tasted very blunt, had no taste. -Place is very tiny and crammed. -Toilet is dirty."}
{"text":"The food was great! Best handmade noodles ever. Made right in front of your eyes. Savory broth. Hearty helpings of both beef and noodles (the small was plenty) filled me up with just the right amount of spice.   Able to add additional heat at the table. Wait staff is attentive.   This place is very small. More eat, than dine due to space limitations. But you will enjoy the food enough to squeeze in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"No matter what difficult time and challenge we are facing, we should first concern: Peace is better than fight; Love is better than hate; Help is better than ignore......SINGLE, like Cycling, Swimming, Music and Dancing, Sea foods and Traveling.  Ordered the signature noodles (large) extra spicy - very good broth, quite clear, and the spicy level is just the right heat. I absolutely loved the fact that they let you pick the width of the noodles, this means that they hand pull the noodles as you order! I honestly do not think there are a lot of places that can offer that kind of customization and we are talking about downtown Toronto! Not even a lot of places in Markham offers that. I picked \"Flat\" because flat noodles are hard to find."}
{"text":"Tried this today for lunch.  Arrived just after 12 and another party of two ahead of my party of two. Was told it would be 15 minutes but it was really like over half an hour.  Didn't really appreciate the incorrect wait time.  It's a small place.  Noodles looked like they were coming out slowly at the lunch rush.  We ordered as soon as we sat down (having had time to study the menu) so our food arrived fast.  We got the large #3 thickness beef noodles.  The soup was very nice and the noodles good thickness and chewiness.  Too bad the noodles don't come with a veggie or two in it. There was some turnip.  Overall a good bowl of soup noodles in the area.  Different from Magic Noodle where we usually frequent."}
{"text":"Food is great, but not worth the insane wait times.  I had to wait half hour just for a single seat and they ended up sitting me across from a stranger which was somewhat awkward. Then I had to wait another half hour for the food.  If you can come at non busy time then it's worth while, but otherwise save yourself the time and frustration unless you're a die hard noodle fan."}
{"text":"I would assume any asian restaurant located in the downtown core would have relatively higher standards than their counterparts in Chinatown but sadly no. I know you're basically here for the food and nothing else. Forgive me for having unrealistic expectations. So their noodles are made in house which is great but does that set them apart from any other hand pulled noodle joints?   I opted to try their noodles with homemade pork sauce. The picture kind of reminded me of zhajiang mian, the Chinese soybean noodle dish. Well the taste was underwhelming to say the least, the ground pork was weirdly textured (makes you wonder what other fillers it contained) and the sauce was basically a cup of pan drippings at the bottom of the dish. Yes the noodles were fresh & cooked well but the lack of flavour, oily \"sauce\", bizarre ground meat & indifferent staff really made this whole experience disappointing. I could have gone to Chinatown for better, cheaper and same kind of half ass service.  As well, paying is an ordeal in itself. This place has LIMITED space and you need to get to the cashier at the entrance where other customers are waiting for tables and where the service area is also located. Clearly they have not thought of a better system like I don't know, have patrons pay at their tables and waiting customers line up outside--what a novel idea!"}
{"text":"There's a man pulling noodles right at the front and putting them straight into the huge vat of boiling water, so you are guaranteed to have the freshest noodles. It was busy when I went today and a good sign are the Asian aunties eating there.   They have different styles of noodles, all written in Chinese and pinyin and you have to ask the server to describe them which is difficult. May be beneficial if they added photos. Their menu is simple, serving just noodles with small side dishes.   Ordered a small ($9 with tax) for take-out and it's a lot of food! They give you thin slices of daikon and beef (if you love tendon, you'll love this). Was also given a huge container of broth and I only needed half. Broth-wise, I had expected it to be saturated with beef flavour but not at all. Quite bland with other seasoning.  Staff was very courteous.  Would come back."}
{"text":"The dry noodle with meat sauce is one of my favourite noodle dishes. Great price for the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"Nothing all that special to be honest. Not bad, not great. Just an average noodle bar with some preserved sides. Broth isn't spectacular. Noodle texture is good, but honestly there are lots of places that do similar.. Even some buffet restaurants now."}
{"text":"We have a decent alternate to the food courts here folks. The noodles are made fresh by hand and one has an option to choose the size of the noodles to boot. The place was packed when I visited. I opted for the takeout option on this visit. They package the items well with the broth and dry items separately. They also provided a pack of hot chillies which provided the kick I felt the beef broth warranted. The noodles are good and beef was OK as well. I think this place would be a great spot to cure the winter blues.  I think I will try the sides in next time as well. Solid place for if you want to get your noodle fix."}
{"text":"I was super excited to see another Chinese noodle soup place in dt core. But man was this disappointing. The soup had no depth, except for a strong presence of MSG and super salty. The worst part was the noodle. It was not even cooked all the way through. Waitress was trying to clear my friend's bowl while she was still eating. The side dishes cost around $4 and the size is the same as the side dishes in Korean restaurants that they give for free."}
{"text":"Great food for an affordable price. The broth was flavorful and yummy so were the noodles. The food also came so fast although the restaurant was pretty busy."}
{"text":"I retired my Yelp reviewing days, but I had to write one for this place. My first time having Lan Zhou noodles was in Montreal of all places. After moving to Toronto from a sunny city and weathering my first winter in the minus double digits, I was craving a hot soup noodle. Okay, you got me. The real reason for the craving surfaced after binge watching a bunch of Chinese street food videos of the Food Ranger on Youtube. If I can't go to China on a whim to have noodle soup, then one on Edward St in Toronto will have to do. Anyway, enough jibber jabber. This place did not disappoint. The place was clean, packed with local Canadian-Asians, which you know then is legit. The servers were very friendly and the broth was,.. oh, the broth! Come all ye faithful. The broth was clean-tasting, very flavorful, just the right amount of saltiness, and played well with the chili oil and beef. My will power is at work, resisting the urge to go two days in a row, because we all know that's how addiction starts."}
{"text":"The food is really great and just tastes the same back in China. I was there on the second day of their business, Unfortunately the servers were not doing a good job. Ordered a tea boiled egg and they just couldn't deliver it. Asked them twice and they just said it's coming then go back to talk to other servers...so we had to cancel the dish in the end and by the time we pay the bill, I can see the eggs are right there in the cooker ready for server,  and they literally just need to take it out and deliver to us...Considering it was just opened at that time and the food is good, I will give 4 stars."}
{"text":"Super good and flavourful noodles, both the Lanzhou noodles and the noodles with pork sauce were delicious.  The place is usually small and crowded, usually there's a lineup. When we went, a bunch of side dishes were sold out so we didn't get a chance to order them. A good thing though is while you're waiting you can watch them make the noodles by hand. I think it's crazy how Chinese hand-made noodles are only like 10 bucks. Would totally go back again!"}
{"text":"This place has made its way into the \"too lazy to check out anything new, and just want something good\" rotation. The highlight is the hand pulled noodles, which are just the right level of chewiness. And flavoured nicely with the beef broth. The meat is good enough to not be distracting from the experience.   Would recommend a small, unless you have a really big appetite. It's quite sizable. I don't understand how anyone can actually finish the mega. I would have to fast for a week to even think about it."}
{"text":"Great taste, incredibly affordable, and extremely generous portion sizes. I always get the vegetarian (not on the menu, but if you ask for it they can do it), so they give me a free appetizer as well."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with three people. It's a very small restaurant but we waited in line and ordered our noodles so that they'd be ready by the time we were seated. I had the thin noodles with beef and even the mild was slightly spicy with the chili oil on top. Overall, it tasted great! Was pretty neat you get to watch the guy hand pulling all the dough at the door too. I'd come back but wouldn't recommend for more than four guests due to limited and cramped seating."}
{"text":"MOSTLY GOOD SERVICE.!!!  I was use this restaurant maximum time and never rush me. Always make me happy."}
{"text":"We were on vacation in Toronto. And found this Chinese noodles . Sooooooo good!!!!! We ordered a ??? .  We finished all. The beef is good too ."}
{"text":"Decent place. Overly friendly service. Noodles are a little on the bland side but for the price it's worth it."}
{"text":"I work close by so this is pretty convenient location for lunch.  It's a small place so if you're going for lunch on a weekday, go before 1145 unless you like lining up for things...  There are so many hand pull noodle stores around now and this one doesn't disappoint.  Not the best as the service was mediocre but the food held up to a good standard.  Customizable noodle thickness is nice, except you really don't know what tastes better without having tried it before lol...so maybe the choice isn't that great of an idea?  But flat noodles are cool.  I'd come back because i'm so close by, but maybe not a plate I'd go out of the way to eat at.  I have my fave place for hand pull noodles heh...sorry"}
{"text":"Finally a hand-pulled noodle place downtown! Really delicious noodles where you can choose whether you want it flat or round and the level of thickness. You can even watch the noodles being pulled at the window while you wait. The menu isn't very big so we got the regular broth with some spice. We appreciated that there was more chili oil on the table so you could add to your liking. The flat noodles were perfect for the flavourful broth and were nicely chewy. I ordered a large which turned out to be bigger than I thought! A small is definitely enough to fill you up, and a mega is good for two to share. It was a bit expensive compared to other noodle places I've been to but not overly, especially for the area.   The place is very small and it seems to be busy all the time. Be prepared to wait during dinner hours, we waited about 15-20mins. The door does not shut properly, so there is a thick curtain to block most of the wind, however, if you're sitting near the entrance, it can be a bit chilly in the winter.   Overall, I would come back if I was craving noodles. I hope they extend their menu in the future!"}
{"text":"10pm they ran of noodle.Drove all the way for nothing. Worst noodle shop ever. I recommend to call them before just in case to make sure they still have noddles."}
{"text":"I love restaurants that offer very simple menus. This places does that. As you can tell from the name the noodles are fresh and hand-pulled which means they taste pretty good. The price is also very fair. Just watch out for very long line ups during busy hours!"}
{"text":"So excited to have a Lanzhou Ramen restaurant near my working place. Always has waiting line, typically 10-15 min wait for one person seat. Very simple menu. Traditional noodle is my favorite. The side dishes are not so good. Maybe could try beef if feels noodle itself is not enough. Big portion though, and I could hardly finish small bowl."}
{"text":"Oh their weekend only braised beef soup noodle is so good. Very tender beef chucks and so much in volume. Loving it."}
{"text":"Very happy to find they offer a vegetarian broth, though it's not on the menu. Broth was light but still good, and complemented the salty noodles very well. If only they offered tofu or one of the amazing Chinese vegetarian fake meats for the veg version, this would be a five star dish. It didn't even come with egg, which would have added a lot of protein (and, I suppose, cholesterol.) Because we didn't have meat the side dish was complimentary, which was stellar news. We got the spicy cucumbers, which were very tasty -- up front the sauce has a mellow smokey flavour with the heat sneaking in as an aftertaste. Great service too, and though it was busy on a Monday night, we got a seat quickly. Just brace yourself for the occasional series of loud bangs as the noodle technician slams down the next batch on the granite counter. That's what you'll be doing shortly after too!"}
{"text":"Favourite place to go for Chinese noodles... have gone there multiple times since it first opened, and always leave satisfied. Great price for the amount that you get. The place is a little small and can get really crowded during peak hours, but that's to be expected. You can see the chef pull the noodles and them cooking it all there. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Tiny spot so come early. Delicious noodles! Menu is quite simple, but they have different kinds of noodles, thick, thin, flat, round etc."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try hand pulled noodles. Having this downtown is a dream. The noodle chef is fantastic and works the dough like a magician. Being able to choose the thickness of noodle and watching him hand pull it was great. Be prepared for a bit of a line up as the seating is minimal. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious noodles for a good price. They have a bouncy texture, and the cold jellyfish side dish was fresh. Owner and the head noodle cook were friendly and service was fast without rushing us."}
{"text":"This hand-pulled noodles are amazing, very flavourful and filling. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Never had al dente, freshly made Asian noodles!  What a treat!  A very limited menu, but who cared?  The pho was amazing, the noodles to die for!!!   GO THERE!"}
{"text":"It was quite busy despite being a little after 1 PM. Expect to wait. That should be a good sign though.  Came with a party of 3, which is quite an odd number. Restaurant had no issue with it however; they just took a two-person table and added an extra chair and now it's a table for 3.  However, the restaurant is pretty small, and moving around is quite difficult. That extra chair didn't make it any better.  There is a single washroom in the back. Might be nice if they had a second one, but I don't think they have room for it.  We ordered the mega bowl to split. It is quite a large bowl, though my issue with it is the amount of meat and veggies seems to be the same, just with a lot more noodles and soup.  Taste was alright. I enjoyed the chewy texture of the noodles. The soup was ok. You can definitely split a mega bowl between two people unless you're a huge eater.  It's too bad they don't have some small wooden tables outside."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's because I'm just not a fan of this style of food, but i was underwhelmed by the food. I ordered the kuan noodles with pork sauce and my husband ordered lanzhou xi noodles and we shared the spicy cucumber. I thought both noodle dishes tasted pretty good, but there seemed to be only one note to the flavour. Half way through the meal I thought to myself that I would never crave this nor would want to come back. The cucumber was also disappointing, but I'm not sure what this dish is supposed to taste like. I just didn't like it. The noodle making was also very loud. Made me as well as the people at the table next to us jump. The service was friendly and the place was small and cute."}
{"text":"Come on Yelper's, I don't know why peoples over rated this place since is not as good as everyone said. So, went in around 3.30 pm so I don't need to line up to try it. Don't expect any services here since the place is small and most of the servers not sure which one to serve. I ordered a small beef noodles soup spicy with thick noodles ( kuan noodles) I think that's what it says on menu. Soup base is not as flavorful and with spicy it feels like not even a little of spice. Noodles is under cooked still hard and hard to bite to part. Not much choice on the menu 2 kinds of noodles and some side dishes you can order. If want to try out yourself could go around 3-4 PM so don't need to line up. Not worth lining up for such a noodles. Lots of other food in the area. Overrated Yelper's"}
{"text":"I may not know much about Noodle buy these are definitely not what I expect. I ordered the wide size thinking it'd be thinner but it's thick and chewy."}
{"text":"SO GOOD - perfect on a cold night .  A small menu, everything is perfectly executed."}
{"text":"Probably the best hand pulled noodles I've had in the GTA area. First of all, right when you walk in you can see the chef literally making the noodles which is really cool. The place is quite small and the ventilation is not great, so don't expect too much from the location. However, the servers are nice and my friend and I were seated at a window seat after waiting for 5 minutes. We ordered one megabowl to share and honestly it was so worth it! The amount of noodles was very generous- and they are so good. The soup base, beef, and everything about it comes so well together. I highly recommend sharing a megabowl if you don't eat that much and you come with a friend. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The noodle soup is simply amazing. Choice of 6 different noodle sizes. Had the large was very filling. Simple menu. Will definitepy return and reccomend."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious noodles. They only have a few things on the menu, but all of them are delicious. Their chilli oil esp is the best chili oil I've ever tasted.  The broth is delicious, and the noodles have hood texture. They got a nice range of noodles too - from hair thin, to thick, to flat. Watch out for the sizes though. Their large is huge, and the extra large is bucket sized.  All that said, the servers were really sweet and the prices were pretty reasonable. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My friend and I both ordered a large size of the beef noodle bowl, he went with medium wide (second largest size) noodles and I went with extreme wide noodles (largest size). The noodles themselves are really good, nice texture and it's really fun to select a specific noodle size/type to go in you dish and know it's freshly pulled to order. I found the extreme wide noodles very consistent and slightly wider and thicker than the medium wide, which was thinner and silkier. The medium wide also didn't seem as consistent as mine was but overall we both really liked the noodles here.   The soup itself is more of a bone broth type soup, so it's a bit plain, akin to soup a beef soup stock but with a bit more flavour. I personally really liked it since it's kind of like noodle soups my mom made growing up but I can see how some people would feel that it's a bit flat. It also comes with scallions, cilantro and desired spice level. The chili oil here is SO good. I added more to my soup since each table has a container of it. I liked the flavour of this lighter soup it come super hot so it was perfect for a cold day.   The noodles are topped with thinly sliced beef and a few slices of daikon radish. I really like beef and daikon together in general, I think it's such a classic soup combo. The beef itself was a bit disappointing though, the slices were a bit chewy and most often than not, dry tasting. I wish they'd have more tender beef. This is my main reason for marking my review lower.   Overall, I still liked my dish and it'll satisfy my noodle cravings. I would like to go back to try their pork sauce noodle though and maybe their weekend only brisket noodle soup, which I would hope is more tender and moist than their regular sliced beef."}
{"text":"Lacking restaurant but home to some delicious noodles!  It was hard to rate this restaurant because there were some things I loved and some things I hated about this place.  Pros: - Hand pulled noodles!  They had the perfect chewy texture that you can only get from hand pulled noodles. - Chef making the noodles.  I absolutely love that you walk in and can watch the chef pulling the noodles right in front of you!  Cons: - Cramped seating.  Three of us were seated at a small table for two, one of which was seated in the aisle and had to get up to let customers past. - Service.  The restaurant was busy but the staff was very pushy about getting us in and out as soon as possible.  While I understand their need for turnover, there are tactful ways of doing this and they were blunt and pushy. They also seemed very cold.  When I left I told the staff member that was ringing me out that their noodles were absolutely delicious and he just grunted at me and showed me the door. - Cilantro!  This can be good or bad to some people but I didn't like that they threw a handful of cilantro in the noodles without mentioning it on the menu.  Overall, the noodles and soup were really good!  I would consider coming again if I just wanted a quick bite to eat.  However, I'm very disappointed that they can't surround good food with competent staff."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet. It's amazing! If you can get a seat.   Overall thoughts. This place gets a 5 star because of their consistently amazing noodle soup. While the other dishes are also good, you gotta go for the noodle soup!   The store itself is really quite small, and they definitely make the most out of it.  And by that I mean you'll probably bump elbows with quite a few people (literally).  I usually get there around 5:30 and pretty much always have to wait about 10-15mins before being seated. Probably the best feature of the store is the noodle puller at the front.  You get to watch some one hand make noodles right in front of your eyes which is really cool (and quite loud actually).   Now for the service. They're generally quick, and despite the size of the store, they have quite a few people on staff to keep up with the many customers. I really feel like they're trying their best to address everyone and have no complaints!   The food. I think i've ordered everything from their (very small menu) and Oh. My. Gosh. The noodle soup is BOMB. The broth reminds me of a lighter, sweeter pho that just tastes soooo good with chili oil. Its super comforting yet quite complex in flavour. The size of the bowls are also HUGE. I think for most people, the 'small' will be enough to get you full and the 'large' you will be stuffed. And a mega is not for light hearted but great to share with a friend or 2.  The dry noodles are also good but only come in one size and only flat noodles. I felt this dish was definitely a weaker. Pretty good flavour, but not as complex and personally, a bit too salty for my liking. It does however come with a small bowl of the same soup you get in the noodle soup!   Lastly the side dishes. I was considering docking a star because they no longer seem to be offering their jelly fish dish! This was the most refreshing snack! But during my last visit it seemed to have been replaced by potato??? Someone please let me know if it comes back! I need more of that delicious chewiness with aromatic sesame oil in my life.  I've also gotten the Jelly beef dish which is also quite good. This is the same beef that goes on the noodle soup but cold and covered with a sweet and spicy oil based marinade. The flavour is great but its a bit more oily than I would like. Also this is probably the most 'expensive' thing on the menu. I believe one dish is about $7 and you don't get very much. Keep in mind the small noodle soup is only $7.99!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food is excellent. The service is good and the food comes out quickly. It is a small space so it can be difficult to get seating. I recommend the san xi noodle size."}
{"text":"GB Hand pulled Noodles replaced a previous Northern Chinese food place that was in this spot.  It's definitely much busier now the before.  It's a tiny place, so good luck getting a spot during prime hours.  Broth and noodles were pretty decent, but I'm not sure I'd gamble on seeing if I can get a table for a rush lunch.  If it was off hours and I happened to be passing by, I'd definitely come back for another bowl."}
{"text":"Cold dreary rainy weather always makes me want a bowl of hot noodle soup, so I found myself here after making a stop at Eaton Centre.  Lucky for me they offer a vegetarian version, since the menu only has beef noodle soup and a dry pork noodle (I believe it was jiajiang mien although I didn't take a close look.) Vegetarian broth with extra veggies and a free side dish! I got the cucumber side dish, although I wanted to try the jellyfish. They have a stewed egg but the price was cheaper so I figured it was more worth it to get the cucumbers.  I also ordered with the widest noodles, and I suggest either getting those or less wide, but not the thinnest ones since you won't be able to appreciate the texture as much.  They forgot to give me cilantro and scallions so I got it on the side. Overall, probably a 3.5 star for noodle consistency. Giant bowl for a small size, good flavor of soup (I ordered extra spicy and it still wasn't very spicy), and cheaper if you pay cash (no tax)?   Come here and get your carb on."}
{"text":"Amazing hand pulled noodles! The menu is small, only offering two types of noodles, but they do it very well. Soup was fresh and light, not too salty. The beef appetizer was soooooo good. Jelly fish was quite enjoyable too but it was light on the sesame oil. Maybe it was just our dish.   Cucumbers weren't memorable. Will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"This place has the benefit of being in a high traffic area in downtown. Otherwise I don't see anything so unique about this place vs other Chinese hand pulled noodle places.   I would say that if you compare bowl sizes, GB is slightly more expensive than places like Magic Noodle. But I'm not holding it against them for this. The broth and noodle texture is about the same as what you can get a Magic Noodle.  There aren't a ton of seats and this place gets filled up quickly. Not a bad choice if you have the craving. But I'd still prefer other hand pulled noodle joints because the menu option is very small here. For example, Magic Noodle has a more extensive list of appetizers and customization options."}
{"text":"A rare five star review based on a single visit, but this place is fantastic. Like the name says, they concentrate on fresh handmade noodles and they do it exceptionally well. The menu is pretty compact with the emphasis on the signature beef noodle soup. Noodles come in many sizes and are cleverly shown in a sizing chart on the menu. We ordered the soup with the KUAN a thicker and flatter noodle. Coriander and green onions are an option to which we both said yes. Texture and taste of noodles was perfect, soup was tasty and spicy but not too salty. The thinly sliced beef was delectable. We had a side of spicy cucumbers but they were not as tasty as they looked. We spritzed them with vinegar and that made it all better. We were very hungry and ordered the large but probably would go for a small the next time. The taste reminded us of Xi'an Famous Foods in New York which was a real favorite of ours. Price is great. The place was busy on Saturday at lunchtime but the service was fast and friendly. We will be back again very soon."}
{"text":"Noodles were really good and fresh. Also the prices were very reasonable and the portions large. Felt there could have been more vegetables in the noodles I ordered but overall it was very good. Servers were really rushed to take our order as they started asking us what we wanted before we even sat down. Overall a good experience and I would come back again!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for noodles and want to try something other than the ramen that has taken over the city then you gotta try this place.   It's the best of it's kind in the city.   The freshest noodles possible and lots of interesting options that you won't find at this quality."}
{"text":"Omg it was so nice. Love this place. I love how they have vegetarian option. The broth of the soup was so flavorful. It was too spicy for me tho, i was asked if I wanted the spice to be added on to my soup  and i said yes. I should've said no cos the lady put too much garlic chili on it. But it was awesome. I liked the texture of the  flat noodles other than the medium/ extra wide noodles. It made it seem like  a lasagna texture pasta. I dunno."}
{"text":"I did take out because the line was too long. The noodles were amazing, but the soup was luke warm, almost cold. Next time, I'll eat-in."}
{"text":"I suggested trying this place for dinner before going to a concert nearby. When my friends saw the line and the tight space, they were not very enthusiastic about eating here. But their tunes quickly changed when they got their orders and by the time we left, everyone agreed it had been a great choice.   The noodles were absolutely fresh, tender and delicious and the soup broth was tasty, not too salty but quite flavourful and but the meat was a bit overcooked. My friend raved about her dry noodle dish.   If you're willing to tolerate waiting in line (we waited about 10-15 mins) and squeezing in, it's definitely worth it. We also loved watching the noodles be hand pulled while we ate. Dinner and a show!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre hand pulled noodles... been hearing the hype about this place from so many other yelpers and friends so we thought to stop by on a friday night. As many reviewers mentioned, they get busy during dinner time but the turn around time is quick. Very small seating area can probably sit 25 people MAX at one time. As you enter you will notice a chef actually hand pulling the noodles through a glass. There are many options you could get your noodles cut. We tried the super thin and also the flat noodles.. The noodle itself is chewy and tasty.. soup base was a little salty and with the added chilli oil can cause the soup to get very oily. There is only two meat options, beef or pork, but the pork one is the minced pork with dried noodles... so ultimately your soup noodles can only be with beef. Beef slices were ok but not my fav since it was rough to eat.. they also have side dishes to eat with your noodles, we tried the kim chi and seaweed... seaweed was good and flavourful but the kimchi was so SOUR. I was expecting spicy and salty goodness... but it was pickled for too long and came out very sour. Wasted the entire dish.   Pricing however is very fair and standard for noodle soup.. you also have the option of ordering regular, large or extra large for the noodle soup. Regular is more than enough for anyone but we did see alot of people ordering the extra large! Staff here are also EXTRA friendly and attentive.. i have never been asked \"how is your meal, is there anything i can do for you\" at an asian restaurant so many times! (came around like 3 or 4 times)  A meal here will last no longer than 30 minutes as the noodles come out quick. credit card is also accepted which is a bonus."}
{"text":"I have hopped onto the East Asian rice noodle soup bandwagon and I'm not seeing a trainwreck up ahead anytime soon!  I have seriously bucket listed over 30 noodle restaurants and this was one of my most anticipated stops.  Let me conclude before even beginning my explanation: I was very satisfied.  The restaurant has gravely limited seating, so even at 7pm during a Thursday evening, there was a lineup out the door.  If you're impatient with waiting and if you're more apprehensive about waiting outside when the colder weather hits, this may not be the best choice to frequent during peak hours.  However, the workers do try to work through the line as efficiently as possible, as there will be a runner going down the line to take orders before you're even seated.  Note that because of this need for efficiency, the runner will zip through the explanations and questions as quickly as humanly possible (as if you've cranked up the play speed on a video by 3X).  Therefore, you'll get the awkward vibe that the worker isn't friendly and has no time for you. My advice: Just live with it and don't take offense to it 'cause it's a prerequisite to receiving your delicious noodles.   One of the best qualities of this establishment is that, like many Chinese noodle restaurants, you have the liberty of creating your dream noodle dish. You get to select the type of noodle, the size of the bowl, and the level of spiciness.  They have handmade noodles made in front of you like a public performance as well as SEVEN noodle varieties, which was extremely exciting for me as I'm used to being restrained to up to four varieties at most noodle shops. Prices are reasonable here, so you don't have to hold back from getting a large size either. My friend and I decided to split a mega bowl, which fed two hungry hippos quite well! The only negative I have about the menu was the fact that they only have two dish varieties and their protein seems to be isolated to beef. However, they've made a name for themselves with these limitations, so they serve some mean noodles nonetheless!  Receiving the mega bowl was as exciting as opening up a Christmas gift. It was very aromatic and the spicy kick complimented the other spices and herbs in the broth.  The noodles had a nice chewiness to them, which you could tell resulted from the dough being hand-pulled rather than store-bought. The broth also wasn't excessively oily, so I didn't have to hold back from slurping up the soup while eating. I was a happy camper.  If you're exploring Chinese noodle soups, I highly recommend checking this restaurant out. Despite having  a limited menu, the constant lineup speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Always a lineup for their noodles as the place is pretty small. Not mad that the menu is also small because everything on it is amazing. They only have two types of noodle dishes- the dry one and the soup one, but you can choose the noodle thickness. My favourite are the flat noodles as I find them to have the perfect noodle texture. The noodle broth is amazing, but I always ask for less chili oil because regular spicy is too spicy for me. Also try the jellyfish in sesame oil side dish, I get it everytime!"}
{"text":"Cheap. Filling. Fast. The largest bowl of noodles can easily be split by two people for dinner. While the restaurant is small, service is friendly and efficient. If you're struggling with your noodles, don't be afraid to ask the server for a pair of scissors to cut it up - they know the drill. Given that this location is right downtown, expect there to be long wait at lunch or dinner. (And expect to be waiting outdoors.) You should be fine if you can avoid those peak times. The menu is small, I've skipped the appetizers every time and gone straight for the rich broth and noodles. Also, shout out to the guy standing in the kitchen pulling those noodles - count me impressed."}
{"text":"This place will not remain a hidden gem for long. Their sauces and noodles are incredible. The weekend-only braised beef and tendon has the perfect chewiness and QQ-ness. The flavors are a perfect mix of fresh and light with spicy and earthy. I don't know how they do it, but they do!  The hand-pulled noodles are to die for. They are magically thin and springy. I ate mine like I hadn't eaten in weeks.   My favorite meal yet in Toronto."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm love this place! Noodles are always cooked perfect - doughy and just the right softness. The broth isn't as rich and savory as a typical ramen place but that's okay with me because I go mainly for the noods. Sides are always tasty too (I've tried the egg and the kimchi) but the serving sizes are large enough that you don't need any appetizers unless you're super hungry!"}
{"text":"This place serves delicious hand-pulled lanzhou style noodles. You do not come here for service or ambiance. You will be disappointed if you are expecting great service.   You come here for the reasonably priced noodles. The menu is simple. The portions are generous.  The soup noodle was delicious. We got the thick noodles and it was cooked well - aldente.   We also got the dry noodle mixed with vegetables and pork. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I came here twice and the noodles were amazing each time! The second time I went, I came with my friends on a Friday evening. We all decided to order 3 bowls and a few side dishes so that we can try a little bit of each because...why not? We ordered the beef noodle, the beef on dried noodles and the mega bowl.   I found everything was really good, soup wasn't bland and was very flavourful. We ended up finishing all of it except the mega bowl which we were still working on and some guy walked by and thought we were all sharing one bowl. He made a comment about us four girls sharing one bowl. Side eyes were given to him..obviously he did not know we wolfed down the other two bowls plus side dishes..pfft!  Please keep in mind that this place is SMALL, there will be a lineup so be prepared! I will definitely come back...perhaps even tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but it definitely fell short for me. This place is super tiny, they'd definitely have lines out the door if they're instantly busy. The menu is very simple, with one noodle option and a few appetizers. You can choose your noodle thickness and the server asks which ingredients you don't want included. The noodles were chewy & cooked to perfection, but the soup didn't do it justice. The soup was things went downhill -  it was beyond salty. :( Although I liked this place, I don't think I'd come back with so many other noodle shops around!"}
{"text":"This might be the first time that \"smart\" technology actually worked for me. Because I'd clicked on GB at one point, Yelp kept pestering me with headlines like \"Have to been to GB yet?\" \"Write your review for GB!\" \"Did you check out GB?\" \"Remember about GB...\" The reminders helped, and we made a point of heading there, and were thrilled that we did. Thanks, algorithm, for tracking and prodding me in a helpful way.  This is the only way to have noodles - fresh and chewy in satisfyingly hot and spicy broth. The noodles are offered in 6 different thicknesses. I chose the second thickest, they had excellent bite and perfect heft. Fans of Xi'an Famous Foods in NYC will appreciate the noodles here, the spiciness and the coriander, though the focus here is exclusively on beef soup.  This place is humming. You might have to wait for a table, but don't despair or abort mission - things move quickly. We were lucky to nab the last 2 empty seats during a rush period.  We arrived super hungry, so ordered a tea egg to start and a cucumber salad. The egg was great, but the cukes were not that yummy. We added vinegar to give them a kick, but the chili sauce wasn't spicy, a bit odd.  But who cares about cucumbers when the main event is the soup? I ordered the large, which was massive, and couldn't finish all the noodles. But I did feel my beef ran out a touch too quickly. Next time I'll order the small with extra beef and expect to give GB a full 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went with my friend. It was good. Got small noodles each and shared beef and spicy cucumber appetizers. Thick noodles are good.   Will be coming back."}
{"text":"The two of us ordered two bowls of noodles and a side dish of spicy beef shin. My boyfriend ordered the MEGA size special beef noodles, while I got the braised beef tendon noodle.  The MEGA size was totally worth its value! Flavour wise, the soup was superb! The spicy oil was perfectly flavoured as well. However for the noodles itself, I was recommended to get the third thickest round noodles and was told that would be regular. It came out pretty thick! Much thicker than the authentic Lanzhou hand pulled noodle should be. The texture of the noodle was quite hard, making it hard to chew and digest.   The side dish was great! Flavoured perfectly. Just the sliced were quite big, making it a little hard to eat, but that's not a big deal.  I was would come back if I was ever in the area on a cold day, maybe I'll try a thinner noodle next time to see if that would be better."}
{"text":"There was a long line up when I got here but it moved pretty quickly. I ordered: - langzhou noodles with xi size noodles, spicy. The noodles were very tender and the soup was tasty. The soup base was a good level of spiciness. The beef was very thinly sliced and lean. I prefer my beef with a bit more fat on but it was delicious nonetheless.  - noodles with pork sauce, noodles were kuan thickness. The sauce was delicious and there was a good amount of pork and sauce to coat the noodles. The carrots and cucumbers added a nice crunch and was refreshing. This also comes with a side of plain broth. - jellyfish app. It was crunchy but didn't find anything special for this app when compared to other Chinese restaurants.  Service was also good. They were quick to take our orders and the food came quickly. Restaurant is a bit on the smaller side so we ended up sitting at the bar. However, I didn't mind too much as I could catch glimpses of the chef making the noodles.   Overall, it was a good price for fresh noodles especially around the Yonge Dundas area. I even had enough for leftover lunch the next day. I would definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Delicious. New Chinese beef noodle restaurant. Sichuan wife approves. Ate here I think 3x while in Toronto. Very filling too, we ate here after dinner once. Big mistake too full to eat it all! Highly recommend visiting here for a bowl."}
{"text":"We decided to stop here for lunch on a whim, and was extremely happy with the result.  The place is tiny, but turnover is fast due to the efficient service.  We were handed the small menu on line and were ready the second we were seated.  We ordered the signature beef noodle soup, the noodle with homemade pork sauce (aka zhajianmian), jelly fish and tea eggs.  We debated a bit about the size of the noodles, and ended up deciding to use the wider noodle for zhajianmian and thinner ones for the noodle soup.    First of all, this was one of the best Zhajianmian I've had, it had just the right amount of sauce, and perfectly seasoned.  The noodles were well cooked, and paired well with the sauce.  My friends who ordered the noodle soup were jealous of my noodles, and all raved about it after trying it.  The beef noodle soup was good, but on par with many other Lanzhou beef noodles I've had.  They made a mistake with the noodles and gave up the thinnest one, which did not hold up well in the soup and became a bit mushy.  Also beware if you order large, it is really quite big, we barely finished half of it.  I've also ordered extra beef for this season, which probably wasn't necessary as the beef was just average.  The jelly fish and tea eggs were quite good, particularly the jelly fish, which can be hit or miss when ordered in restaurants.  This one had a good amount of jelly fish and was very well seasoned.    The prices were reasonable for the amount food we ordered, will definitely be back again when we are in town."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Although the server was a little misogynistic with : \"ladies shouldn't slurp big noodles that's for mans\" I still enjoyed the soup very much. Go with spicy broth because it's not that spicy and you want all the flavor possible. Seeing the chef pulling the noodles at the front restaurant is also a cool perk."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here a couple of times and both their dry and soup noodles are great! I also really like this shaved beef appetizer they have that comes in chilli oil. I think this is comparable to Big Beef Bowl and Magic Noodle, two other places I love for hand pulled noodle soup."}
{"text":"Solid place for hand pulled noodles. Not a large menu to choose from, you can get the beef noodle soup, dry noodles with a pork sauce, vegetable noodle soup, and they have a choice of one more on the weekends. This place seems to get packed quick even on a weekday!  I like how you can choose from a variety of noodle sizes ranging from super thin to extremely wide based on your preference. They also have a few options for appetizers/sides. The service is quick and the servers are very nice. The noodles are cooked just right and the broth doesn't taste like it's full of msg. The large left me super full, I think next time the small would hit the spot and I'm a pretty big eater."}
{"text":"For downtown close to my work , its not a bad alternative . Its quick , fast and easy . But if we are comparing to other chinese hand pulled noodles , i would suggest either Magic Noodle or Big Beef Bowl"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Reminded me of being back in Asia. The #2 noodles had the perfect amount of chewiness."}
{"text":"Limited menu: Only 2 types of noodle varieties, a soup and dry noodle.  Huge servings, average taste: We ordered the Mega beef noodle soup to share and that was more than enough for the both of us. Keep in mind we do not have small appetites :)  The noodles did not impress me, however. The soup was a bit too cold for our liking, while I prefer my noodles to have a firmer texture.  Interesting appetizers/sides: We ordered the jellyfish in sesame oil as well as the beef jam. I know these sound unappetizing but stay with me here - they happened to be the standout dishes of our meal! The chilled jellyfish acted a refreshing, sweet palette cleanser in between the sodium-rich noodles and soup, while the beef cuts for the beef \"jam\" was tender and packed with flavour.  Small space: Prepare for a wait when you come at mealtimes on weekends. It's understandable with the limited seating available."}
{"text":"I found myself killing time in the area, and rather than having lunch at one of the food courts, I turned to Yelp to see what my other options were.  I went shortly after the lunch hour, as I had no issues getting a seat (though it was still somewhat busy). I was seated along the bar, along with other solo diners, as I imaged they'd rather save the tables for parties of 2 or more. This was fine by me, as I got to see the action in the kitchen, and witness the guy pulling some noodles!  Shortly after being seated, I was asked right away if I was ready to order. They've got soup noodles, available in small, large, and mega, and you get to choose which type of noodle style you'd like. Alternatively, there's a dry noodle which is available in one size only. With the pressure on me, I went with the dry noodles with homemade pork sauce ($10.99). And within minutes, I was quickly given my meal.   It was a rather big bowl, and came with bok choy, and julienned carrot and cucumber tucked around the bowl. In the middle was the pork sauce, and underneath was the fresh, delicious noodles. The noodles were stick and chewy, and when mixed in with the pork, were nice and saucy. Overall, a filling and flavourful meal.  It was a hot day and I don't know how people do soups on scorching hot days, but I'd definitely like to come back to try their soup noodles!"}
{"text":"I loved the chewy, fresh noodles. The hand-pulling really makes a difference!  I ordered a small beef soup (no spice) and it was definitely large enough to feed two people. The couple next to me ordered a large, and it looked just about big enough to take a swim. Definitely have generous portions here.   The broth was extremely salty and I found myself downing countless glasses of water throughout the entire day afterwards.   My friend and I sat at the bar by the south-facing window, and it had no shades so it was overwhelmingly hot.   The place itself was cramped, not the cleanest, loud, and very busy. Definitely not somewhere to come if you want a nice atmosphere.   Bottom line: the noodles themselves were amazing and their portions were generous. Will come again for a filling lunch but not if I want to bring someone along."}
{"text":"Wow, what a novelty in downtown Toronto. Landzhou HAND-PULLED noodles. In a great location too next to Bay St. on Edward. Inside is clean and relatively modern.  You might think, \"What so special about hand-pulled noodles?\" Well they pull the dough right up front at the entrance in view and smashes the dough on the table.   BAM! BAM! BAM!   That's pretty much all you'll hear as they pulverize the dough in front of you. Poor dough. I bet the chef gets a great work out from that. It's quite the experience.  The noodles are delicious and comes with great tasting beef and ingredients -- green onion and chilli oil. The portions are also massive and reasonably priced, though the amount of ingredients don't seem to differ too much by size. Make sure to let them know if you have any allergies. I'm a fan of the cold dishes, in particular the beef slices with chilli oil.  Only couple of things -- seating is a little bit cramped as they've been filled every time I've gone. Also, service staff can be more experienced... pretty sure they forgot orders one time I went... but I don't mind them too much."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new hand-pulled noodles place right by Eaton Centre! I came at around 6:30pm for dinner on a Saturday evening, and there was a line-up. The place is pretty small, with limited seating, but the line surprisingly moved very quickly and the 3 of us were seated without too long of a wait (~5min). While you're waiting, you can be entertained by the chef hand-pulling noodles at the front. It's definitely not a place where you go to for a slow meal and sit and chat for hours on end; more like: sit, eat, and leave shortly.  The service was good, quick, and efficient. Despite how busy they are, the waiters still come by to ask if you need a water/tea refill, which is a plus!   I ordered the mild Special Lanzhou Beef Noodles (Small - $7.99). You can choose between round or flat noodles, with differing sizes. According to the waitress, the flat noodles are more chewy, so I opted for the medium-sized flat style. Food came quickly, and it was steaming hot. The dish reminds me of a Chinese version of pho. It comes with a good amount of thinly sliced beef and radish, topped with parsley and green onion. The noodles were so chewy and delicious! Despite ordering mild, the clear soup base wasn't bland, with just the right amount of saltiness and flavour. You could add chilli oil if you want a bit of a kick.  When a restaurant only has 2 main dishes on their menu, you know it's gotta be good since they specialize in those! I'll definitely be back to try their non-soupy noodle with pork sauce!"}
{"text":"Pretty great! The amount of food you get for the price is generous. I made the mistake of ordering a large for $10.99 with standard thickness noodles thinking it'd be small. I could barely clear half a bowl and I was full. I'm definitely gonna go for a small next time. Must-try in the Bay-Dundas area!"}
{"text":"Handmade noodles really are a difference. Good noodles, amazing portions. I had the dry noodles and the meat on top was well seasoned and delicious. Fair pricing and I'd come back if I was craving it. Small area so some awkward seating but if you like noodles, definitely try the dry ones! Hope they expand their menu later on."}
{"text":"Medium wide noodles are worth a try! It'll make you perfect your chopstick skills. Beef brisket was typical, and soup was good - not yet the best bowl. The regular bowl was good enough for dinner. If I could have the noodles with good toppings and better soup, I'd come here everyday."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place since it opened last summer but there was always a line up that snaked out the door. Totally forgot this was on my list of places to check out until last Thursday at 4:30 pm.   I was the only customer in the restaurant and staff were busy wiping tables and chairs, mopping the floor, and scrubbing windows. It was a bit weird to see everyone cleaning while eating but it is nice to know they try to maintain cleanliness.   Ordered the classic Lanzhou beef noodles. I'm not an expert when it comes to Northern Chinese food so I asked the waitress which type of noodle was popular and she told me to get the widest one if I wanted a chewy texture. I wish I ordered the thinner noodles.   Overall, I was a bit let down by the 5 star Yelp reviews. The food is average if you compare it to Scarborough/Markham. I guess the standard for Chinese food is a bit lower in DT Toronto..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is small, so don't be surprised by long line ups.  We've been there a number of times for great noodles, beef and broth.  Price is very reasonable and staff are very helpful.  Great for a quick and tasty meal!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of the dry noodles! The noodles are chewy and doughy (if you're a fan of wider noodles) and it has the right amount of savoury mince meat sauce. Would love to see a larger menu, but it definitely cuts down on waiting time!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Coriander/parsley is a great touch that I wish more Asian noodle houses would indulge in.  The sesame chili oil isn't particularly spicy, so if you like spice, I would ask for extra of that.  The thinnest noodle option is very thin, FYI.  Small portion is hefty but not overly so.  Will def return, most notably to try the dry noodle pork dish."}
{"text":"Friendly but a little bumbling at times staff and hearty portions. The place is quite small but it's welcoming and the menu is of equal size. I ordered a small of the beef noodles, and had the thinnest noodle. I wish I got one of the wider noodles instead because the thin ones weren't chewy at all. The bowl was huge despite being a small and I couldn't finish the whole thing.  The food is good, but it isn't amazing. If you're looking for something affordable to fill you up, I'd definitely recommend it though."}
{"text":"Happened to be nearby and it did not disappoint!  It is very reasonably priced for a great soup base, handmade noodles.   A wide range of thickness and width of noodles to choose from.   No reservations, the place is pretty small.   The original spice is on the spicier side so if you can't handle spice, order less or no spice. Cilantro and green onions also an option complimentary add on.   Street parking available. It gets busier before 12pm of Sunday's because free parking before 1pm.   Some side dishes to choose from, unfortunately they haven't had jellyfish for the last 3 months.   It's really tasty!   One lost star on the place being really crowded and loud. Barely any space to stand and wait.   There is a younger vibe going on here with all the students coming in. I don't mind it at all but you know, just FYI. I felt younger by being here LOL"}
{"text":"I came in expecting a lot from the amazing raving reviews but the food wasn't anything out of the ordinary. It was a good place with a good location. Food was pretty good with a simple menu to choose from :)"}
{"text":"Small menu, but that also means good quality!  I got the small beef noodles with flat noodles (there are many noodle sizes to choose from). The small is really filling, I cant imagine finishing the mega size! The beef was also cooked really well. Although I would have appreciated more toppings (ie. vegetables), I would definitely go back in the future especially because of the great service we got. It is a little cramped and busy though, so definitely get there earlier :)"}
{"text":"Small menu, 2 main items and 5 sides to choose from  Tried the noodle with homemade pork sauce (saurce on their menu haha) with \"xi\" (noodle size, original \"preferred\" size as they said is \"three xi\"  The boyfriend had the special land you noodles with \"two xi\"  We also ordered the jelly fish in sesame oil  I loved my noodles! It also came with a refreshing side soup.  I found the broth of the bf's soup decent, but he enjoyed his very much as well.  They ran out of the tea egg, will come back to have some of that next time.  Portions: Generous! We were both stuffed, couldn't even finish our jelly fish side dish  Place: Small! I'm sure this place gets packed"}
{"text":"I come here a lot! Although there are other places with hand-pulled noodles near Dundas, I really like this place. You can pick the size of your noodles and I really like the soup base for the noodles. Although their menu is small, a bowl of noodle is all I need as the portion size is generous.   This place is small, so if you are one to two people you can get a table fast. I would say at max, they can seat a table of 4 people easily but be prepare you will need to wait. They don't take reservations, it is a first come first serve system.   Overall, this has become my go to place for beef hand pull noodles whenever I am in the mood."}
{"text":"The menu is very small but there's really no need for a lot of options because their noodle soup really is the star!  You can choose the noodle shape (round or flat) and width (thin or thick). I chose the thin noodle because I find it infuses the broth better than thick noodles. Of course the noodles are individually hand pulled for each order. Love the texture! Nice springy chewy texture.  What really blows my mind is their broth. It's very clean tasting. Although it is clear, it packs SO MUCH flavour. I got spicy but really it isn't that spicy.   Came around lunch and had to wait about 5 mins for a table. The place is small so there's limited seating. But definitely worth the wait! Tastes just as good if you decide to grab take out as well :)"}
{"text":"This was our first time in Toronto together. We wanted a nice meal before heading over to the movie theatre. We saw this place on Yelp and decided to check it out. I'm so happy we did. The place is small but very clean. As soon as you walk in you can see the chef making the noodles. With each loud bang as the dough hits the board you know you're getting fresh noodles.   The pork noodles were perfect. My husband had the beef and it was so tender and delicious. I also opted to get the jellyfish appetizer. It was a bit too drenched in sauce but it didn't overwhelm the flavour.   Next time we come back to Toronto we will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Super tasty well prepared delicious food.  GB Hand-pulled Noodle has a small well curated menu.  You could choose the width of the Noodle when you order.  Service was fast but not hurried.  We started with 3 sides.  The cucumber with chili was amazing - We ordered a second.  The cucumber was crunchy, the sauce was quite savory.  The jellyfish was the tastiest version I've had. - it was delicious. The chili beef was great with the right balance of beef with chili made even better with fresh cilantro.  Despite the meat centric menu, the server was able to make suggestions that satisfied vegetarians in my party.  The server provided a serving of cucumber with chili and tea eggs - perfectly prepared in lieu of pork or beef.  I had the Pork with Hand-pulled noodles with a broth on the side.  Other non-vegetarians in my party ordered the Mega size Lanzhou Beef Noodles.  The Mega size serving was so large that no one could finish the serving.  The only criticism about the Mega sized Beef Noodles is that the Beef to Noodle ratio was too low.  Perhaps we'll be ordering the large Beef Noodles with extra Beef next time we're here to improve the ratio.  Overall great meal!  I highly recommend GB Hand- pulled Noodles."}
{"text":"Although the place is small and crowded, we enjoyed the taste of the noodle and the broth a lot. Do expect a wait as it is a new and popular place. Check out our instagram (@excited2eat) for more food photos around Toronto and the world !"}
{"text":"Other reviews about the food are well written and more detailed so this will be more about the service. I will say I liked the variety of noodles as each of us chose something different. The staff here were very proactive and friendly.  They saw us peering in and came out invited us in, very quickly made room for 5 (including baby) stored the stroller in back and explained the menu very well for us newbies.  Later they rescued us when my 18 month old spilled my dish all over the table and floor... 10/10 polite and patient."}
{"text":"Vegetarian option is amazing!  Generous portions and lots of flavour.  Customer service could improve, but this place always has a line up out the door!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to say that this was a good place to dine and is fairly authentic compared to other hand pulled noodle places in downtown Toronto. But aside from the food I have to say customer service as well as sanitation was extremely awful. Because the front door of this restaurant is always open due to the restaurant's popularity, I found myself surrounded by the occasional flies, mosquitoes, and fruit flies. A fly managed to dive into my soup during my time here, and I told the waitress about it. I honestly didn't want to be unreasonable and cause a scene so I explained to the waitress about what happened since I had planned on taking the remaining half of my noodle soup home...  Not only did the waitress accuse me of lying about the fly, she also refused to acknowledge that the fly was in the soup when she brought it to my table (which I had never claimed was the case, I told her a fly went into the soup), she also said it happens all the time and I'm just supposed to accept that there will be insects in restaurant quality food. \"There is nothing we can do,\" she said multiple times. And then I told her I wasn't going to pay full price for the lack of care and sanitation the restaurant refuses to acknowledge. With some back and forth, they were only willing to give me 20% off of the noodle soup I've ordered, and I barely consumed half of the order when this happened.  So this was definitely not a good experience for me and I'm quite disappointed at how they handled the situation. Normally in other restaurants they would immediate replace the contaminated food, but I honestly didn't expect them to argue why they shouldn't have to have the standard duty of care when it comes sanitation and clean food. I also am well aware that I am responsible for my own food, but as a restaurant they should definitely also acknowledge that proper insect and pest prevention should be in place.  So for those of you that want to try the place, the food was definitely authentic and good. But I would get take out rather than dine-in just to avoid insect free noodle soup."}
{"text":"They have a great noodle soup and Toronto knows it (just look at the lineup) ! They serve two types of noodles exclusively but they do it so well.   My go too is a small bowl of extra spicy beef broth noodles with the second thinnest noodles. The broth is so light but so flavourful. You can taste the beef in the pieces of daikon in the broth. The noodles are a nice chewiness and will not become mushy as you take your time eating.  Overall, a great coup noodle restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place gets quite busy! Came here for dinner on a Thursday and luckily we got a table for 2 in 10 minutes. The menu is pretty simple (which is awesome) and they took our orders while we were waiting. We ordered the jellyfish and I got the thinnest noodles while my friend got the third smallest. I really enjoyed the thinnest noodles because it gets all the flavour in while my friend liked the thicker ones because they were chewier. Although we both got small bowls there was soooo much food that we didn't even finish it all! Jellyfish was also good. I ordered it spicy and it wasn't too hot - there's extra chili oil on the table for those who want it spicier. The only downside is that because the place is quite small and they get pretty busy - the waiters put the bill on our table and stood there until we paid even before we finished eating to get us to hurry up! Service is meh but I'll come back for the noodles. :)"}
{"text":"Great find. Just picked this as a random location because it was 2 blocks from the hotel.  Hand made noodles. Great show to watch!  A small menu, but they know what they are doing and they do it very well. Very well.  Total fun here now. I guess we'll be eating here again when we come back for a Leaf's game."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this recommended establishment on a chilly November day.  We had the mega beef noodle soup, spicy, and opted for the med wide noodle. The noodles had a slightly chewy texture which I prefer. Thickness did vary a bit but then these are after all freshly made hand pulled noodles.  Soup base was tasty and just right - not overly salted. Beef slices a bit on the tough side though. Too bad the beef tendon wasn't ready at the time of our order. Next time!  Over all a nice meal for a reasonable price.   Service friendly and attentive, establishment clean."}
{"text":"This place was a total surprise and defeated all expectations. Although relatively new, the place was very under control. You can pick he thickness of your noodle, I went with number 2, and thinner cut, as well as the spicy noodle broth. However all broths were made with beef and one of our friends is a vegetarian, they accommodated with a vegetarian noodle and free appetizer. You can pick 3 sizes regular large abs mega. You can test your luck with the mega but you will get your money's worth. Very cheap and filling spot!"}
{"text":"Great place with fair price. I really like the authentic taste. The place is small, but it's very clean."}
{"text":"When the restaurant had a soft opening way back in April (and only one item on their menu), I went to try it out. The noodles were very normal, the broth greasy, and there were only a few slices of meat and vegetables. I thought it was because they were just opening. In the past few months, I saw people lining up a long time at this restaurant so I thought it got better and decided to try it out again today. I ordered the same thing and it was literally the same as what I got in April: greasy broth, very little meat and veggies, and, even worse, hard noodles. At least they have three items (and side dishes) now!   I don't understand what the hype is about. This restaurant is similar to other Lanzhou noodle houses in Toronto (Lan Zhou ramen on Dundas, Magic Noodle, etc) but more expensive. The staff were super friendly though so kudos for that."}
{"text":"The hand pulled noodles are as good as you can imagine and the beef broth they come in is so delicious and satisfying, I really wouldn't let anyone add any chilli oil until tasted pure. It's on the table anyway, and I just added a little or a lot to my spoon, so it wouldn't taint the beautiful broth.  I also had spicy cucumbers on the side, which are amazing. They are fresh and crisp and have that slight mouth numbing sensation from Sichuan pepper, but in a totally good way."}
{"text":"GB Hand Pulled Noodles! I finally visited this place during lunch in downtown and I did not regret one bit!  The wait time here gets pretty long if you come after 12, so if you could leave your office a little earlier, I recommend being at this place by 1145am.  This place is small, but the turnaround is quick since once you finish your noodle, they literally ask you to leave because of the amount of people standing at the door.  While waiting, if you are bored, you can watch the chef making the noodles, just make sure you are ready for the occasional BANG sound as the chef smash the dough on the table.  Food wise, they have 4 appetizers and 2 mains to choose from.  The 2 mains is either the soup noodle or the cold noodle, both option you can choose the size of the noodle you want.  I tried both and I prefer the soup noodle more as it wasn't as salty and was packed with flavours!  The beef although cut very thin, but the taste is great. Ask for mild spicy and you have yourself a very delicious and affordable lunch in downtown ($13 tax and tip in)."}
{"text":"I would describe it as better ramen/pho. Like other soup noodles you've got a broth, meat, & veggies however the noodles really do set GB apart. You get to choose the style of your noodle and they have a much richer texture than ordinary soup noodles. My only complaint is the restaurant is quite small which means a bit of a wait for a table and limited space even when seated."}
{"text":"The fact that they make the noodles right there in front of you is pretty cool. The portions are also massive! The bowl is big enough to swim in it. But the flavors...meh.  I got the vegetarian soup with thick noodles for take out so i didn't eat in. It was nicely packaged and reasonably priced but I wasn't too impressed by the flavors as they weren't much. The broth was very simple and the main flavor was salt. The veggies had no seasoning just finely chopped. They did give me a side of spicy sauce which helped with the flavors a bit. I feel like I didn't properly experience this place and am planning to go again and try another dish. So i might update my review again.  Food: 3/5 Service and atmosphere: NA Price: 4/5 Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Huge portion, a small here is like a large at other places. The noodles are so soft on your teeth, very yummy. However, broth is just ok and they need more meats and vegetables. The service is awesome, always a big smile and very accomodating."}
{"text":"There's only two types of noodle dish (soup noodles and non-soup noodles). We ordered one bowl of each. I got the flat noodles and I like that they were chewy and don't break when you pick it up with chopsticks. The noodle soup was alright.   The seatings are limited, and the tables in the back can be difficult to get to. We were seated at the very last table in the back corner. I couldn't even get to my seat! I waited for the guests at the next table to leave so I could move the table a bit, and then sat down. The waiter was upset that I tried to move the other table (how am I supposed to get to my seat then?).   That same waiter was cleaning tables with a dirty rag. I noticed that he was wearing plastic gloves to protect his hands. When I asked for tea, he grabbed my tea cup WITH THAT DIRTY GLOVE and held the cup by the rim. I understand that it's not a big cup, but I would not drink from that same cup. Who knows what he got his hands in before pouring the tea?"}
{"text":"This was my second meal in Toronto. I found this place on a wimp. I was curious to try freshly pulled noodles, when I got to this location I found it to be a newly opened restaurant that fits about 25 to 30 individuals.  I got one of their original Lanzhou beef noodle soup. It was good, and it reminded me of a similar Vietnamese dish that my mom makes. The noodle were very filling and the small bowl was the size of a medium bowl of noodle soup elsewhere. I waited approximately about an hour, and I think that's just due to the dinner rush on a Friday night."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I came twice since the grand opening and gulped down the noodles both times.  The menu is quite small (the waitress mentioned that they will be slowly expanding), but what they offer is classic and delicious!  You get a choice of small, large and mega and different sized noodles. I tried both the three xi and kuan noodles. Both were really good, but the kuan edges out as the winner for me. I prefer the thicker texture and it just feels heartier. Each bowl also comes with generous portions of perfectly seasoned and not over-cooked beef. The broth is also just the right amount of saltiness (I tend to like saltier broths and the boyfriend prefers milder broths and both of our taste buds were satisfied). If you prefer spicy, they add the perfect amount of chili oil on top, which somehow doesn't make the entire dish too oily.  The actual restaurant size is fairly small, so I wouldn't recommend for groups any larger than 4 people. Service was very fast and the staff was extremely attentive.  I can't say enough good things! I hope their standard remains equally high past the initial grand opening phase."}
{"text":"I've been spoiled by the many hand pulled noodles options uptown... so coming here was kinda underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, the flavours were good, but you can probably find the same size uptown for 2 bucks cheaper (for what it's worth), a lot less line up (and I only had a party of 3), and more comfortable seating.  I tried the spicy beef and loved the chili oily soup. The meat could be of better quality.. would've liked to have the option of a braised beef or something else with less tendon. It was similar to beef with tendon that I normally see at pho."}
{"text":"So delicious that I am craving this now since trying it. Located near the Greyhound bus station in downtown Toronto, this place is crowded and you may be an inch away from the next table. However, the one dish they do, hand pulled noodles in soup, is amazingly savory. And those noodles! The noodles were perfectly cooked and size no. 3 was perfect for me! I shared a mega for $14 with my sister and we were stuffed soon after starting but continued eating because of how good it was!! The service is friendly and fast plus the owner(?) seems to be trilingual speaking English, French and Mandarin. Definitely will be eating here again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is extremely small and they pack their tables super close together, so be prepared to get cozy. Because of their limited seating, it gets super busy close to peak lunch/dinner hours, so to prevent a wait, I'd honestly suggest coming at like 3 or 4pm to avoid crowds. Also note that their weekend special typically sells out by Saturday night so I would also recommend calling ahead to ensure that they still have that special beef noodle soup. For the regular beef noodle soup, you pick the noodle thickness and size. And their sides honestly weren't that memorable or worth it for me, apart from the jellyfish. Food, regardless of eating in or take out takes about 10-15 minutes. I have found that their food is quite salty and will leave you quite thirsty afterwards."}
{"text":"OMG there's a line! It smells good from the outside. There's only a few seats inside. It reminds me of ramen houses back in San Francisco or the Tasty Hand Pulled noodles in New York. So as you step in the restaurant, the noodle master beats the dough for fresh orders of noodles based on what size you want your noodles, round or flat...  The menu is simple but well with the wait.   WARNING the noodles are super long. You may need to have them cut down if you don't manage your noodles well..."}
{"text":"Love the noodles  this is a great place if you are looking for hand pulled noodles in the area. Delicious food, I tried the pork with noodles and beef noodle broth with thin and thick noodles. Both the dishes were delicious. I go back frequently"}
{"text":"I love places that just have one food food item on the menu because they specialize in it and you know it's good. This is precisely the case for GB hand pulled noodles and at their price range it's a great bargain. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, literally pull the noodles  right in front of you. So fresh and delicious! Funny and helpful hosts! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"okay y'all. I get it. these places are by the dozen up in markham. but let us downtown folk enjoy what's here because none of us wanna trek up to markham for a bowl of noodles or pretty much anything if we can avoid it.   this place is good for the area. note: there is that Homemade Ramen place in Chinatown which is actually pretty good. and a new place on Dundas that is pretty mediocre. but now you can be in core downtown on a cold day and go console your frozen everything with a hot bowl of hand pulled soup noodles. Also I know it's small and it's crowded but so is basically anything decent in downtown and have you seen the size of that mega bowl thing? it's HUGE. what a beauty.   that being said, I wouldn't travel for this place. I wouldn't come from markham or even north york for this place. because as a chinese noodle place, it is solid, but not mindblowing.   also, in my experience, service is just not a huge thing in chinese restaurants. so maybe that just doesn't bother me as much but if it does bother you then... yep, you have been warned."}
{"text":"Very good hand pulled noodles!  You can get them with as many pulls as is necessary to your desired diameter.  The chef knows how to boil them just right for the perfect consistency.  Good food, and a good bargain."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for hand pulled noodles just on a side street near Eaton Centre.  This place is quite small with 4 rows of tables (in 2, 4 or 6 configurations per row) and spots at the 2 bars (one facing the kitchen, one facing the window to the street). It gets very busy during dinner time and there's often a line outside of the restaurant. Often times, a waiter will collect your order when you are in line so it is ready for you when a seat is available. The turnaround time  is quick.  There are not a whole lot of options to choose from. Either noodles in soup or dry minced meat noodles. You can choose different thickness of noodles, but the soup base is the same.  My favourite is the pork sauce noodle. It is almost like spaghetti with thick flat noodles and a salty meat sauce (not tomatoey). There is a decent amount of bokchoy on the side. To eat it, you just simply mix it all up and start \"slurping\" the noodles.  The soup noodle has decent amounts of sliced beef with lots of fresh herbs ontop. The level of spice in the soup is up to you to decide. You add additional chili oil for an extra spicy kick. The soup is not too salty and is not filled with MSG."}
{"text":"Amazing noodles, broth, service and side dishes. My fiance didn't like the noodles slapping sounds as they were being made but I loved it because I know my noodles are being made fresh! It's a pretty small space and it's often completely packed because of people coming from sick kids but it's worth lining up for. The mega size easily fed 2 of us and their tea egg and jellyfish were on point. Get the second largest round noodles size and spicy broth and you will be in heaven. There's a hand pulled noodles place on Dundas as well but don't go there this place is infinitely better. Will come here a lot!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars rounded up. I was surprise by how much this place is still poppin. The weekday lunch (12:15pm) wait was extending out the door. We probably ended up waiting 40 minutes to get a seat inside as the establishment is pretty small.   I ordered the small Special Lanzhou Noodles. I had been craving spicy noodles for quite a while and this place definitely satisfied those cravings. The broth is delicious, although a bit oily because of the hot sauce. The noodles are authentically hand-pulled - you can watch the chef pull them while waiting in line! One thing is I wish they had served more beef slices.   Service (despite the long lines) was great. They let us pre-order before being seated so we got our food quicker. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"4 stars... broth is excellent.  Beef with noodle (I ordered the thick) a great lunch. Unfortunate side, location is TOO SMALL, it's cramped, lines (go at off peak if you can..).  Parking is terrible.  If you live, work in the area, great.  If you don't, NOT GREAT."}
{"text":"I finally finally finally got a chance to come here the other day, why?  Because my coworker wanted lunch at 11am.  Lucky for us, that's the perfect time to go and dine because there were tables available.  As we were leaving it was starting to fill up.   The downside of coming early?  I like to see what everyone else is eating before I choose.  The plus side, clearly is getting a table.  On to the food.  The noodle soup was good, I'm not a spicy gal, so I got it plain, my DC got all kinds of spicy, and we were happy.  We also ordered the spicy cucumber appetizer, that was soo good.  I would definitely recommend that even if you don't love spicy stuff.  I can see what all the hype was about!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant twice. It's still fairly new and popular so there was a wait for each of the time I visited.   Service was welcoming and efficient. Their menu is pretty simple with just noodles and side dishes. It normally don't take that long for the food to come after you order.   For the food, I ordered the jelly fish and it was good. I got the same noodles twice which was the one without soup. My friend got the noodle in soup. For the noodles in soup, you can customize the noodle type and spicy level. However the noodles with the meat sauce only comes with the flat noodles and there isn't a spicy version. There is chilli oil on the table for you to add if you want spice.  During my first visit, I thought the noodles with the meat sauce was really flavorful. It has a lot of meat and then noodle absorbed the taste really well. It was so filling but it was so delicious. This was why I returned shortly. However, during my second visit, the same noodles with meat sauce didn't taste that flavorful. I like the noodle texture. But the meat sauce really tasted bland at my second visit.   I have mixed reviews of the noodles with meat sauce. I think it has potential to improve. The restaurant is still fairly new. I hope they can provide good food consistently."}
{"text":"Great little place, tight seating but great food!  We had the pork noodle, it's really neither of us finished it, so don't worry about the size of the portions."}
{"text":"This place has only two dishes. Both are great! Check my pro/con list below :)  Pros: - The noodles are freshly made. You first hand watch them make the noodles and then cook it and then put them into the dish. (The guy doing this is awesome!) - Both dishes are delicious. You can even decide what kind of thickness you want your noodles to be.  -The server keep checking up on us to make sure you have enough water + that the noodles are okay. - Close to Young and Dundas which makes it a convenient location to eat at.  Cons: - SMALL space. The restaurant could only fit around 20 people max. There is usually a line so it takes a while to get sit down and served. You could break up your group if you want to get served faster, but I prefer eating with my friends.  - A bit too noisy as there are tons of different conversations going on as the noodle is slamming his block of dough.   Overall would come again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!!!  Delicious food.    Watched my noodles being made and it was amazing.  The texture was so outstanding that I ordered noodles to go so I could have more for breakfast in the morning!  I love trying new restaurants when I travel and took the time to hunt down parking in Toronto during the gam s in order to eat here.  It did not disappoint!  Broth is delicious, choose your noodle width or diameter depending on taste and order more to take home with you!"}
{"text":"Food is good here. But don't really like the service. Not every Asia people can speak Mandarin and they just keep speaking Mandarin with us."}
{"text":"GB Noodles definitely has the best noodle-for-dollar value in downtown Toronto! I shared the mega sized Lanzhou noodles between two people for $13, and I have NEVER seen such an enormous bowl of noodles in my life. The mega size can definitely fill up three hungry people! I would give a 4.5/5 for taste - not the best I've had, but definitely up there.  We also shared the Lanzhou Jam Beef which was spectacular and authentically made. For $10 each, this was an absolute steal and I will be coming back before they raise the prices!   The waitstaff are also fluent in English and Mandarin, which is unusual for many authentic Chinese noodle shops. They offer great service and are super friendly."}
{"text":"Small place in a dense downtown area, so seating is very limited. Noodles are above average, but the sauce is okay."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to visit GB hand-pulled noodles! It is a boutique-sized noodle place, expect to wait in lines if you come during prime dinner time. Service was good. It gets humid in the restaurant because of the kitchen since it's an open-concept. If you're sensitive to the heat, try get grab a table near the entrance!  I ordered:  * SPECIAL BEEF NOODLES (Small size with thin noodles)  I've asked for mild so they added less spicy sauce. Even though the spicy sauce is little in content, it's actually still pretty spicy!! The \"thin\" noodles are actually as thick as udon noodles. If you want to get thin noodles, I'd suggest you choose the \"super thin\" noodle option."}
{"text":"It was good but nothing special.  Small is probably enough food.  Cool to see them pulling the noodles in front of you.  There was a line, if you're going for lunch show up at 1145"}
{"text":"Mmm mmm... Freshly made noodles!  it was aighttt"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and wanted to try it b/c of the great reviews.  I'm glad I did.  It's very small, so make sure you have enough time at lunch.  There was a bit of a lineup when my colleague and I went, but we had a bit of flexibility with our time.    It was really cool getting to see the noodles being made in front of your eyes.  They make it look so easy!  The menu is quite small.  But they keep it simple so they can pump out the food I'm sure.    I had the noodle soup with beef.  I like that you can pic the noodle size.  I was a little surprised to see a tomato sauce on the menu.  It felt more Italian than Asian to me, so I was a bit skeptical.  Someone at the next table got it though and it looked/smelled really good so I am going to try that next time!"}
{"text":"I'm behind on reviews but I went here on October 27th 2017 for dinner with a friend.  We were in the area looking for food and decided to come here thanks to Google.   We just made it in before the dinner rush (arrived around 5:30pm) and each ordered a bowl of noodles (I got the beef tendon noodles and my friend got the pork sauce noodles).  The portion was a good size and tasted pretty good.  The downside was the wait -- since the noodles are hand-made, you have to wait a while for your order.  We were seated at the bar, so we watched the kitchen staff prep the bowls.  When we were done, there's not much of table service, so you need to go to the front to pay.  It's already super crowded and congested at the entrance, not to mention the restaurant itself is tiny, so you're awkwardly hovering while the staff ask you where you sat and what you ate before you can get the bill and pay.  By the time we left, the line was already spilling down the street... unsure if it's because of the hype or that the noodles are amazing, but for folks who work and live downtown, this is probably one of the few places you can get hand-pulled noodles.  Otherwise, try other places uptown in Scarborough or Markham -- it's much cheaper there."}
{"text":"Wow! What a fun place. The noodles are solid, and the largest size is COMICALLY LARGE. As in, I actually laughed out loud when I saw it go by my table. This is truly a cheap eats gem.   Side note: I also got the tea egg. It was nothing special. Stick to the noodles."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of hand pulled noodles, so when my friend told me about this place I knew I had to go. It's a small establishment and can seat a about 25 people. Their menu is mainly their hand pulled noodles and side dishes.  I ordered a small bowl of their noodle - medium thickness, and side order of sliced beef extra spicy. The noodles tasted good and had a good texture to it. The soup was okay. Even though I asked for extra spicy, and can see the chilli oil floating on the soup, it wasn't spicy. The meat was good as well although there wasn't much of it in the bowl."}
{"text":"Mmmm....hand pulled noodles. This place has been giving me dreams of delicious, hot hand-pulled noodles for months now. Yes, it's that good. I wish I had discovered this place earlier as I normally opt for sub-par food near the Greyhound station when catching a bus! However, this is definitely my new go-to-place. The noodles are served quickly and the amount of cilantro and beef is generous. I strongly recommend the noodle size number 3 - I found size 4 a bit too large for my liking. The only downsides of this restaurant is that it is a tiny place with limited seating plus the sound of the dough smacking against the tables can be a bit alarming. Nevertheless, I will return!"}
{"text":"Smack. The lovely sound of dough slamming on a an equally lovely countertop.  Tried the classic Lanzhou noodle soup. The portions for small and large are actually huge. The price for the small is around pho pricing so cheap.. I think GB is a better value than pho and ramen at this price range. And I'm a huge pho guy, but the vermicelli noodle at your avg pho place can't compare to this.  The soup is tasty and didn't have any grease. Tasted quite healthy and refreshing.   Got the flat wide noodle it was so good and chewy. Wow, mind blown. Glad this place opened in a great location at Dundas and Bay. Will be back."}
{"text":"I can not believe the quantity of food (amazing food) I got for the price. I got so much noodle for 14 dollars I could not finish it, but it tasted so good I forced myself to eat until I almost passed out. Probably the best noodle shop I've ever been to in North America."}
{"text":"The noodle soup is really good. The soup is really traditional Chinese western food flavor! Also, you can see how they make the noodles. By the way, if you want try the noodles, you must put some spicy oil in the soup, it is not very spicy but the oil is really tasty!"}
{"text":"BANG! Don't be alarmed, it just the cook slamming the dough that makes the noodles. The vibrations from him wrestling with noodles can be felt throughout this small venue and adds to the whole experience.   I had the fattest wide noodle dry with the beef and thoroughly enjoyed the jellyfish as well. The wait staff were super helpful and attentive.   The pice is super reasonable and u can order medium, large or super large which is almost too much.   The apps are only $3-4 bucks.   Unique taste and very filling."}
{"text":"This place has, what I would consider, limited seating. However, the service was great and fast. I ordered the \"special Lanzhou noodles (beef)\" with the \"flattest\" (??) variant of the noodles and paid for the \"mega\" size for $13.99, less spicy (I wasn't up for very spicy food that night). I had a little bit of sweets before so that may have contributed to my inability to finish the whole thing, but this bowl of noodles was huge! I think you'd be getting a good deal on both the regular and mega sizes. I'd definitely recommend trying the flatter noodles as you normally don't get to try these variants of noodles at other noodle restaurants unless it's a pulled noodle restaurant. Overall, I was very satisfied! Highly recommend this newly opened pulled noodle restaurant downtown!"}
{"text":"OK so let me start with I like the noodles a lot here and watching them make noodles is an interesting experience while you wait to be seated. THE GOOD: there is a few selection in menu but that really is all you need. During my many visits there I have yet to stray from spicy beef soup with braised egg. I change the size of the noodles sometimes from flat but that is my staple. ONE warning, do not slurp the spicy broth the little chilli flakes will kill you -but that never stops me, the broth is delicious. The portion is just about right and the fact the noodles are made there makes it extra yum. The jellyfish salad thing is interesting - the fish is like gluten and it tastes like the generic sweet and sour Japanese salad dressing - don't be frightened it is not inedible.  The bad: THERE IS NO ELBOW ROOM. The tables are cramped and you barely have enough space to pull out your chair to sit; I am not a size 5 but if you pass size 10 you will have troubles. Also because multiple seatings are set up per table (to save the amount of condiments they need to put out and to squeeze in more people i guess?) there is even less elbow space, privacy and you may have to wait to get some more chili oil into your broth. Service is sparse. YOU will need water after you meal and there is nobody - all the staff is huddled in the back somewhere talking to themselves waiting for you to end. Thankfully they're just as slow to bring you the bill - which means service is generally slow, and strangely I find that less offensive than those who rush to give you the bill but can't be found when you need water. Lastly , I think this is new -the servers hustle for tips. Yesterday I went to have some noodles for the first time in a long time -and not only did I get attitude when I asked for more water and napkin, the server practically ASKED for tip .My friend had cash for tip so she didn't include it in her debit transaction -and the server said defensively \" this doesn't cover tip\" when my friend handed over the machine. She repeated this several times because my friend was so thrown off by this statement dosed in bitterness. I had to practically TELL my friend that the server is asking for tip for the amazing service we just received. When did tipping become mandatory for crappy service? the food is still yummy but as there are plenty more handpulled noodle places in the city with smiling servers who don't hustle for tips."}
{"text":"I am from a Chinese ethnic background so I grew up with these familiar flavours. You can watch them make the noodles in front of you and the broth is really nice. Tasted beef-based to me, much like home.  The noodles are fresh.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I have only been there twice and the first time I felt the broth was a bit bland."}
{"text":"I've found my favorite Lanzhou noodles in GTA! I was never a big fan of this dish since it's too carby for me, but GB has changed this for me. I got the Small Beef Noodles with Narrow Thick Noodle, not spicy.  Soup: clear yet flavourful Noodle: perfect bite & texture. The flat noodles are slightly softer.  Beef: the most beef I've ever seen in a bowl of Lanzhou noodles! So good, large slices, doesn't fall apart/melt in the soup! I like this more than the usual cut of beef in LZ noodles. Radish: cooked, would prefer if sliced thinner  Came around 12:45pm on a Friday with no line up! But the space is very small, so be prepared to wait and look at the menu while in line so you can order just before seating - very efficient. You can also watch the chef make the noodles."}
{"text":"Noodles is good and fresh, but the broth tastes average. I got max spicy but it isn't spicy at all but greasy oil.  The restaurant is very small and loud with lots of people talking and constant noodle smashing sounds.   I overheard two staff in the kitchen were making fun of the customer who was at the time taking a video of the chef that was making noodles. Felt a bit surprised of the rudeness.   Probably wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Good place, good service, food came kinda late however it was really good and the portions were good and fair"}
{"text":"We were at Eaton's and searching for a quick dinner place. Pretty glad we found this restaurant as it was fast and delicious.    Came here around 6pm on a Tuesday, and were seated within 5 minutes. Keep in mind that the place is pretty small, so it's probably best for parties of 4 or less. I was surprised by the lack of items on the menu, but it actually made it simpler to order.You choose the noodle type, thickness, toppings, and spice level. I'm glad I went with the broth version, but I'm sure the dish would taste great without soup as well. Gobbled up my noodles promptly, and it ended up being around $25 for the both of us."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant a 3.4 and by all means, that's a good rating. I just had a lot of great hand pull noodles.   I came here on a Wednesday night and there was a small line up. The waiter gave us the menu while we were waiting. The menu was short and concise. I got the noodles with the flat noodle. I controlled the amount of spiciness I wanted in my soup noodles. While my boyfriend got the thin noodles. His thin noodles had more of a bite than my thick noodles. We also got two appis: spicy cucumber (soooo good) and seaweed. There was nothing special about the seaweed. You can get it at any Chinese restaurant.   I wished there was more options on the menu. They could have added more vegetables into the soup noodles. However, there was a good amount of beef."}
{"text":"2 small lanzhou noodles + 1 jellyfish app = $22. Not bad for a tasty and filling meal.  Can request to add green onion and chili oil. The chili oil is the same as what's on the table so if you're not sure what your spice tolerance is, you can just add your own spice after your noodles are delivered.  The restaurant is pretty cramped with tables right next to each other and very little space to weave out towards the washroom/cash/exit without tucking in chairs. Even at 5pm, the restaurant was pretty busy (~2/3 full)"}
{"text":"Had the small beef soup, noodles were medium thick, it was good. I would go to again."}
{"text":"Probably the worst hand-pulled noodles I've ever had.  The food was bland already, restaurant is small and staff are minimal in service.  When I went to pay, the server selected the tip option for me.  Ridiculous.  What kind of restaurant forces your customers to tip 15% on terrible service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get hand-pulled noodles in downtown Toronto (there are better places uptown).  Best dish from this place is dry noodle with meat sauce.  It is Chinese version of \"pork ragu pappardelle\" with chewier noodle!"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype.  I used to live in the area and most of the Asian food was catered to a downtown audience.  So - I expected it to be watered down and expensive.  The menu is dead-simple : some appetizers and you basically just choose what style of hand-pulled noodles you want in your soup.  The broth is relatively light but complimented the chewy noodles well.  It does get very busy and there was a pretty consistent line-up the entire time we were there (a Sunday night).  Surprisingly, the service was really good and we never felt 'shooed' to pay up and get out.  Also, if you don't like random loud noises, you will not enjoy the noodle maker  occasionally slapping dough on the boards.  So yup - solid Chinese hand-pulled noodle spot downtown.  I'm just as shocked as you are."}
{"text":"A small little shop that fills up fast but also turns over quickly as people slurp down their noodles and go on their way. Expect there to be a line up but not too bad of a wait. You can spend the time reviewing the simple menu. Choose either a soup or dry base for your noodles, a type of noodle thickness and size of your bowl. That is pretty much all your choices. There are some side dishes to make things more interesting.  I had the thick noodles which were chewy and obviously really fresh due to the vigorous activity of the noodle chef smacking around balls of dough to form our dinner. The noodles themselves were good, even though they were a little uneven at times. The broth was disappointing and not as flavorful as I had hoped. Still a good bowl of noodles to slurp down when the craving hits."}
{"text":"The beef regular noodle is amazing. Fast and attentive service. Not a very big seated area. No alcohol served which sucks when you want sake."}
{"text":"Great food.  For a Thursday night, 8pm, this place was crowded.  I highly suggest going to this restaurant during their off-peak times. Menu is also limited.  Seems very standardized but at least it's simple and straightforward.  Quantity of noodles was also good for a small.  With respect to spiciness, ask for mild.  It's still kind of spicy."}
{"text":"FOOD = Very good; not too heavy, but flavorful; authentic; good portioned  SERVICE = Fast and friendly staffs  PRICE =  Cheap for what the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"For the price and the quality, I'd say that it's A-OK average. I got the beef bowl - noodles pretty good, broth not enough flavor for me, veggies extra $."}
{"text":"Get the beef sauce noodles!! They are great. The effort is really put into the quality of the noodles here. The selection of appetizers and side dishes is wide and you get a large portion for the price. I enjoy seeing  the staff make the noodles in house, it is really a rare find these days. The broth is not as tasty as some other places in the city but it's decent enough."}
{"text":"I first became acquainted with hand-pulled noodles about 10 years ago thanks to a place called Sun's Kitchen in the Pacific Mall. There's just something irresistible about this type of noodles, as they somehow seem not quite as delicate as the regular kind.  So when I heard there was a hot new place downtown serving hand-pulled noodles, I knew I had to check it out.  I arrived just before 1:00 on a weekday and there was a line going out the door. It moved quickly, though, and we got our table within 10 minutes of arriving.  A quick perusal of the menu led me directly to the Noodles with Homemade Pork Sauce, which is, interestingly enough, the exact same dish I got at Sun's Kitchen all those years ago (and the dish I get every time I return). I was asked how I wanted the noodles, and after eliciting a recommendation from the server, I opted to go with \"thin.\"  It's a really tasty dish. The pork sauce, which is chunkier than what I'm used to, is extremely flavorful and actually kind of addictive, while the accompanying veggies work well together, especially when you mix the whole thing up. And the noodles are pretty great, too. Though perhaps not quite as deliciously toothsome as others I've had, they're still quite impressive and tasty and worth the lineup.  The dish also came with a soup that basically tasted like cilantro and green onions in water. It's completely skippable."}
{"text":"This shop is exactly the same as the Lanzhou noodle shop in Montreal. Same problem: noodle too hard, not properly cooked. Meat is very average, and the broth is okay.  This is turning into a fast food restaurant and I don't think this is how Chinese noodles should be perceived."}
{"text":"Seems like a very authentic Chinese restaurant. Noodles are freshly made depending on how thick you like them and you can adjust the spiciness of the soup. They also offer vegetarian option of the noodle soups. Depend portion sizes and fast service. Pricing is also very affordable. Good meal."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite noodle places in the city. Noodles here are so fresh and bouncy in your mouth! The chef is definitely skilled at pulling the noodles and got can watch him at work behind the glass. The added benefit of the open kitchen is that you can see the restaurant is quite clean. The noodle thickness and size is dependent on preference but I usually get round thin as that is the most common noodle. The soup itself is not bad but I find it a bit bland. You need to add a lot of hot chilli oil in order to get the soup to be more flavourful. The chili oil isn't too spicy but it does have a little kick to it. The beef is not that big. It is tender but I don't find it flavourful. I do enjoy the bowl of noodles as a whole, definitely a good place to eat after shopping at Eatons!"}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant twice and had the most amazing meal both times! The hand pulled noodles have an amazing chew to them you don't find elsewhere. The soup is deliciously beefy without being too salty. However, ducking 2 stars because the second visit gave me the worst diarrhea of life! I'm writing this from my bed - I've been sick all day!"}
{"text":"- What I have tried      + Special Lanzhou noodles (4.5/5): I got size 3 for noodles thickness and mild spicy (basically just additional of chilly oil). I recommend get the non-spicy one because they provide chilli oil on each table so u can adjust your spiciness, I found the soup was too spicy. The noodles was chewy and i thought size 3 was perfect. The soup was good but without chilli oil it would be a bit bland, I wish it was sweeter so I don't need to add chilli oil. One more thing is they gave too little of meat and each slice of meat was extremely thin. But overall, the bowl was good, I thought it was much better than the dry noodles.       + Noodles with homemade pork sauce (3/5): this is dry noodles with pork sauce and different types of veggies, comes with a small bowl of soup (the soup was bland). I got flat noodles for this bowl. Again the noodles texture was pretty good, but the pork sauce was too salty for my taste. On the other hand, my bf loved the pork sauce but he also agreed that he still preferred Lanzhou noodles over this bowl. Pork sauce noodles came in one size which was large and we couldn't finish it.  - Portion: Small bowl here is similar to medium or large bowl in pho store, good for one person.  - Price: $7.99 for a small Lanzhou noodles and $10.99 for large pork sauce noodles. This is a pretty good deal for a big bowl of noodles that you can find in downtown.  - Customer service was good and fast, their accents are not strong at all (as compared to other Chinese restaurants). - Place is small, we came around 8:20pm and did lineup for about 10 mins for a table of 2."}
{"text":"Peanut Allergy alert: they use peanuts directly in the sauce/soup, and won't accommodate peanut allergies. While it does have an allergy alert in the menu, it doesn't specify that it's in the food. Discovered this fact after I had already lined up with a friend, but clarified it with the wait staff so we could find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"We went during lunch time and it was very busy. The staff was very friendly and polite. We waited 10 minutes ish for a table which I think was pretty fast considering how busy it was. The food was great especially the soup. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent hot noodle soup for a reasonable price.  Noodles are hand pulled to order (thin to thick, narrow to flat).    These are Lanzhou style hot beef soup noodles.   Service is quick and efficient, lunch style bar.   Quick, hot, and inexpensive.  Perfect winter time meal.   #chinese #noodle #soup"}
{"text":"Fresh pulled noodles were AMAZING. We had the soup (they were out of the other option), and it was absolutely fabulous. I wish I lived in Toronto so I could eat there every week."}
{"text":"When I finally made it down to BGHPN, my eyes were definitely biiger than my stomach.  Since I don't get down to this neighborhood as often, I wanted to try as much of the menu as my hungry stomach will hold.  And boy, was it delicious!  We ordered a large bowl of the spicy noodle soup with the thinnest noodles, the mixed noodles (was that JiaJiangMien?), kimchi and the jellyfish.  The order arrived promptly and the spicy broth of the noodle soup was good.  Beefy with varying spice undertone which reminded me a lot of this one particular brand of instant noodles I buy.  Maybe I'll post a photo of this instant noodle package when i get a chance.  :)  The beef was sliced nice and thin and so were the radish slices.  I loved the cilantro and green onion bomb that accompanied this noodle soup which elevated the broth to a glorious level.  Don't get me wrong, I could taste some MSG in the soup for sure but that's forgivable.    The mixed noodles were also quite good with good balance of shredded carrots and cucumbers to brighten up the flavors and adding a nice crunch to each bite of the noodles.  As much as I enjoyed this dish, I think it would have been better if there was a way to keep the noodles warmer a bit longer as the noodles cooled very fast and I could taste the grease from the meat sauce all too quickly.    Accompanying kimchi tasted like the store-bought kind, perhaps Chong-ga-jib kimchi?  The jellyfish was on the sweeter side but the garlicky zing more than made up for the sweetness.    Overall, I liked the experience at GBHPN.  Only downside was the heavy noodles that sat in our stomach for the next 4-5 hrs after this delicious lunch.  Next time, stick to the small and stay clear of wide flat noodle."}
{"text":"This place is really fun at first. There's a man hand-pulling noodles at the front counter. Great to watch. Slightly less lovely later when your dinner conversation is intermittently interrupted by heavy dough slapping loudly a few feet away... I had the no. 3 noodles in beef soup. It had a smokey flavour that was nice enough, but it desperately needed freshness... Fun, but not quite able to deliver."}
{"text":"Homemade pork sauce with thin noodles.  Sweet Jebus this is a fresh, delicious and filling meal!  While the decor is fairly generic you are kidding yourself if that's the reason you came to this little gem.  Simple great food across from the bus terminal.  BUS TERMINAL!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the dry noodles (thick) with soup on the side. Food arrived quickly. The noodles were perfectly chewy and springy. They were so, so so delicious. Fresh, hand-pulled noodles really make a difference. The pork sauce was fantastic and the toppings fresh.   We also ordered the cucumbers. They were alright but I would not order them again.   Bathrooms were clean!"}
{"text":"I don't think a long review is warranted, simply because it's not safe for me to eat here (peanut allergy).   Suffice it to say that the waiter straight up told me when I was about to order that it wasn't safe to eat. Good to know, but would be better if it was more well known (or at the very least, better advertised).  EDIT: To clarify, I asked before ordering what I could and could not eat, given that I had a peanut (but not a nut) allergy. The waiter then informed me that nothing was safe, and that's where I take issue: they could easily just clean the cooking material better, but not taking the time or effort to do so warrants my one-star review.  I did my due diligence to verify my situation, so please do not send me further hateful comments regarding my allergy. I cannot choose what I am deathly allergic to - I just have to deal with this throughout my life."}
{"text":"I may slightly biased because I am less familiar with these type of noodles. Came here on a Wednesday evening and it wasn't busy, but there were still people in the restaurant. The menu is very straight forward, so we were able to order quickly. Me and my friend both got the spicy soup, he got thicker noodles and i got the medium flat ones. The soup was realyl flavourful and the stuff in the soup was good too, albeit limited (as the noodles are supposed to be the focus of the dish...or so I understand). The noodles themselves were not great. They tasted a little underdone (especially the fat ones). If you're looking for fast service, and standard food, then it's not bad. But I don't really think it's worth the line."}
{"text":"A bustling little place! Service was very fast and friendly, especially considering how busy it was..kudos to that!  We tried the signature lanzhou  thick noodles, and the zhajiangmian. The lanzhou noodles had a good flavor, not too salty, that was quite authentic . The noodles could have been a bit more chewy. The zhajiangmian was hearty, mixed with beef and spring onions. Noodle texture was quite good, although a bit on the sweet side. Overall a tasty, decent priced joint that reminded me of home flavors!"}
{"text":"The noodle soup here is really good and reasonably priced. The menu is simple, with only a few noodle choices and lots of side dishes to choose from. Love that you have the ability to choose your customized noodle thickness. There's over 7, from thin to thick, from flat to wide. It's a small place so not good for large groups. The noodle soup size range from small, large to extra large. you can probably share with a few people if you ordered extra large."}
{"text":"Langzhou beef with jo ye style noodles and noodles with home style pork sauce with soup."}
{"text":"Hits the spot! Small, large or MEGA size noodles!  I came on a cold Friday night around 8pm and had a short wait. The restaurant is quite small and seating isn't the greatest but not expecting anything more from this type of restaurant. Noodles are handpulled fresh. Noodles and meat came in a generous portion (ordered the mega and couldn't finish). The service was pleasantly great with regular checkups and water refills, quite uncommon in this style of Asian restaurants.   Overall I recommend and will visit again!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went back and ordered the mega bowl of the Lanzhou hand-pulled noodles, but this time with er xi noodles. The broth was still tasty, the radishes still a little too firm for my taste, and the noodles super fresh. I do prefer thinner noodles so the hair-thin noodles or something closer to that would've been better for me.   We also ordered the cucumber side dish. Really nice paprika-like + chili flavor, but not as good as the jellyfish appetizer.   Delicious! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I ordered a large beef soup noodle. I liked the noodles a lot, it tasted fresh and chewy. But the soup was average, it was a little salty for my taste. I likely would try dry mix noodles next time, hopefully it's more flavorful."}
{"text":"I'd row across Lake Ontario for these noodles. The spicy cucumbers might be worth the trip, too."}
{"text":"Not being the biggest noodle-soup fan, I first came to GB last November at the urging of my boyfriend.  I had low expectations, all of which were happily surpassed.    GB Noodles features hand-pulled noodles (you choose the thickness) and only 2 items on the menu - a broth with beef, and a dry ground-pork noodle dish.  Having tried both (along with a few of the appetizers, such as the chili cucumbers and a potato dish) I can safely say that they are both flavourful and delicious!  2 things I liked: The soup itself - this place does 1 thing (okay, 2 things) and does it well. The little fruit-flavoured candies you get with your bill.  No idea what the flavour is, but damn, do I look forward to those things when I go!  1 think I didn't: Very small space, which often requires a wait.  However, I don't think we've ever waited more than about ten minutes for a seat, which may be more to our excellent timing than the speed of service."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of hand pulled noodles and I'm so glad that GB opened up so close to me! I've tried the jellyfish app, Lanzhou beef soup noodles as well as the noodles with homemade pork sauce. Both noodles were delicious but I think I prefer the noodle soup. I also like that there is varying noodle sizes so that I hopefully get to try all of them and figure out what I like. The noodles are handmade in front of you essentially and comes out chewy. If you are noodle lover like myself, you must come here! I haven't been let down so far with my two visits so I will definitely be coming back for my handmade noodle fix. Lastly, a tip for couples- share a Mega size bowl."}
{"text":"The place is a little crowded. First taste of noodle and soup is not very impressive but I didn't feel thirsty after. It means MSG is not used too much. 3.5 stars are more accurate."}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Had to wait a little but my family and I were entertained by the noodle maker. Also my sister pointed out the walls in the back may need a new paint job."}
{"text":"This was a great place for hand pull noodles. It was my first time there and was recommended by one of my friend. The place was small, but the environment was nice and cozy and a great place to have a good meal with your friends. It got pack really quickly for a late lunch/early dinner, but we got seated pretty quickly.   Although the menu was small, they do give you the options of the different type of noodles you want like flat noodles, round noodles, and etc. There was a great amount of side dishes to order from as well. When the food came, I didn't realize how big the bowls were. It was a good amount of food for what you pay for. The noodles were amazing. The taste was on point.   The service was great, friendly, and helpful. They were able to answer all my questions about the menu. This is definitely one of my top to go to places in Toronto. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"They just opened 3 days ago and I can already tell that I'll be here a lot. Authentic hand pulled noodles with thinly slides marinated beef in a savoury broth. The atmosphere is cheery with great service.   They only have one main dish on the menu but there are a huge variety of noodle shape and sizes to choose from. I picked the medium 3 sized noodle in a large bowl which was suggested to me.   The noodles are made fresh in front of you. It can be a bit loud so don't sit at the bar if you're concerned. I waited about 8 minutes for my bowl because they don't make the noodles ahead of time. I watched as they go straight from the guy making the noodles into the boiling pot."}
{"text":"Simple, fast, and delicious! There are two main menu items: soup noodles and mixed noodles. The neat part is you get to choose from various sizes and flat or round shapes for the noodles. If you're not sure what you want you can ask the waitstaff for recommendations based on your order. For those feeling voracious, the extra large is quite hefty!  Soup noodles comes in soup with some beef slices and aromatic greens, whereas the mixed noodles comes with a ground meat sauce and cucumber strips. For folks who like strong flavours the mixed noodles is definitely heavier on taste.  You can make your order spicy but it's the same stuff as the container on the table. Even for a non-spicy eater like me it's pretty tolerable, so for those who are seasoned veterans I'm sure it's very mild. The sauce is pretty tasty so I recommend you at least try a dab!  All the noodles here have that freshly-made chewiness that I like! There's usually a line during lunch but it moves fairly quickly. With their reasonable prices I would consider GB Noodles a solid option."}
{"text":"Some of the best hand pulled noodles I've had in a while. Location is nice and the interior is clean and well kept. Only downside is that there is a severe lack of space inside the restaurant so most times there'll be a line and you'll have to sit beside other people."}
{"text":"The zhajiang noodle is incredibly good!!!  And the service  is nice as well, i really like their chili oil! I would try the authentic lan-zhou noodle here next time!"}
{"text":"This is a great little noodle shop! Despite its small menu (soup noodles OR zhajiangmian) the taste is exactly what you'd expect from a traditional noodle shop that serves hand-pulled noodles.  The place is very small and busy so it's best to get there early before it fills up. Portions are also extremely generous and definitely hard to finish a large on your own. Service is usually surprisingly fast as the place is very well staffed for its size."}
{"text":"Great noodles, amazing to watch being made by hand. Flavor was fantastic and the noodles were cooked to perfection. Kimchi on the side was good too.   I'll definitely return next time to Toronto"}
{"text":"This is a great location with close access to the subway and Eaton centre, and I have to admit I'm somewhat mesmerized by the noodle-making on display. Quite an art to it. Plus, they taste delicious. As has been noted in other reviews, you're getting generous portions at reasonable prices. Service is fast and water/beverage refills remarkably adept in spite of the crowds.  Pro tip: don't try to come here with any baggage or briefcases: the tables are so tiny and close together that you'll need to balance items on your feet while slurping noodles."}
{"text":"Decent hand pulled noodle, I like their noodle either super skinny or the wide flat kind."}
{"text":"Today was the first day. The noodles are great, as is the soup broth! It's clear from the menu - they do one thing and they do it well (beef on hand-pulled noodles).  GB Hand-pulled Noodles takes the place of the former Beijing Dumplings. On the corner of Bay and Edward (less than 100 feet north of Dundas), it's a great and accessible, but cramped location with seating for maybe 20-25 people or so.  The kitchen is well-presented - the cooks wear professional white chef apparel and one of them showcases noodle preparation behind a glass barrier right by the door - you'll know right away with all the loud thuds and bangs as the cook strikes noodles against the cutting board while twisting and stretching the noodles. The kitchen appliances are shiny (I am told they were cleaned very well from the previous tenant). The seating area looks much nicer now too.  I ordered takeout, so the soup broth (\"hot oil soup\" - poor translation my own) came in a separate container from the noodles. Don't be scared by the intense red colour of the soup broth as we were - it's actually nowhere near as spicy as it looks, rather there's just a lot of spice and oil which colours the soup red and will leave only a light spicy taste in your mouth. The noodles (I chose the largest size - basically ) are slightly elasticy and made-to-order.  The mega size is HUGE, good for feeding two people at $12.99 (edit: now $13.99). If you eat in the restaurant, it's a gigantic ceramic bowl, or split into two containers (soup and noodles) if taking it to-go. If you take a look at my picture - there's a pen for size comparison.  The zha jiang mian is also quite good. The size of the bowl seems to be equivalent to the large size and there is lots of the 'meatsauce' (poor translation also my own). It's served with a bowl of soup topped with onions and cilantro.  There are also side dishes, but I did not try any of these.  Service is fantastic, the host (owner I assume) was very helpful in explaining the menu, offering a seat while waiting for takeout and opened the door when my hands were full. They are quite busy during the lunchtime rush so it appears they're doing quite well. I've been here about 6+ times since they've opened now.  They take credit and debit here.  EDIT: The MEGA size is now $13.99 and they have now added zha jiang mian (\"pork sauce noodles\") to the menu."}
{"text":"GB is pretty new to the block. With a simple menu, GB offers a bowl of beef (pork or veggie as well) noodles where you can choose the size and thickness of your noodle. Size 3 was recommended by the waiter making for slightly thicker than spaghetti style noodles. I got mine spicy although there are chillies sauce on every table for you to customize it yourself. Definitely recommend getting a small (and maybe extra meat) as the bowl is more than filling enough!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for a delicious and relatively inexpensive meal! We waited in line for about 10 minutes to get a table for two on a Friday night. The place was packed. We tried the famous beef soup and the pork noodles. Both were very flavourful and delicious! The noodles were freshly made and had a great chew. Portion sizes were huge. Service was extremely friendly and efficient. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"One of the best hand pulled noodles places in Toronto! You can choose your noodle size, as well as the bowl size. The small is a very generous portion, but if you're feeling extra hungry (or if you plan on sharing with someone), I would recommend getting the large. My go-to is always the basic beef noodle bowl. The noodles have an amazing hand-pulled chewy texture, but my favourite part was the broth. I got my noodles spicy, and the broth with the spicy was absolutely delicious! Very clear, and not at all oily. The beef wasn't anything special, but the noodles and broth make this place a must try!  The interior of the shop is quite small, so expect to wait in line for at least 20 minutes if you go when it's busy. The staff keeps the line moving, however, so you'll definitely get in eventually to taste the delicious noodles!"}
{"text":"So much hype about this place, but I wasn't thrilled after my visit.   First of all, everyone who was waiting in line was congested at the entrance. Is it that difficult to tell people to form a line outside? Many noodle/ramen places do that even when it's raining or snowing. The place aside from the entrance is super congested too. It's a tiny store. Maybe u can spare that huge area for the noodle chef for customers who are actually paying the bills.  Chinese noodles - they are everywhere in Markham. Price is steep for the food, but not steep for an area like downtown Toronto. Food came and I was truly disappointed. I wouldn't believe the noodles are handpulled freshly if i didn't see him doing it live. Meat and broth were decent though, not too salty.   Something new for downtown Toronto. Maybe my tastebuds were too spoiled because I visited GB soon after my vacation in China. But this store would not survive in Markham where it's full of people used to eating authentic food from their hometown. Not a fan."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I'm pleasantly surprised with this place.  Was introduced to this place by a friend and I think I've just added a new place to go if I ever have a hankering for Chinese noodles.  So the place is nicely located, away from the bustling streets of Bay and Dundas, so there isn't all that traffic noise and mess (on Edward Street, which is basically behind the Atrium, with St Louis Wings, Spring Rolls and that whole commercial complex).  Place is tiny, but the place, and the set up of it, suggests a quick, dine in and get out concept.  But when we got there on a Wednesday (as a table of 4), waiter was quick to get the table cleared and have us seated, and in the meantime took down our order! The efficiency at this place is brilliant!   So the menu itself, only has....really two items, plus a series of side dishes.  Soup noodles and saucy noodles! (I'm pretty sure that's not the actual name, but that's the easiest way to log it into my head).   Ok, even there's two noodle bowls to pick from, you can choose the thickness of the noodles, which I believe come in like 6-7 different variations, and they show it on the menu via diagrams to show the thickness of the noodles (funny enough the names of the noodle size options are in Chinese, and Romanized Chinese, so inside of saying \"wide\", they'd use the word \"kuan\".  I slightly chuckled at it lol.  Oh, mega bonus! Waiter asked me if I wanted cilantro with my soup (if you get the saucy noodles, you get a bowl of soup) and I immediately said no (hate cilantro).  So happy that he asked that, and that I had that sort of customization.  Service was super quick, given how small the place is, and the waitress was like Sonic The Hedgehog, going table to table, attentive, constantly pouring water and adhering to requests.  And not to mention, she always had a smile too, very pleasant.    The food, so I got the saucy noodles (and the usual \"kuan\" noodles).  To describe, it's basically...a Chinese version of a Korean Bibimbap but with hand pulled noodles.  You have the minced pork, julienne carrots, julienne cucumbers and then the noodles at the bottom and you mix it all up.  Also, it came with soup too (sans cilantro).  Taste?  Super delicious, the noodles with the minced pork made for an aromatic, not overly salty taste.  It was slightly sweet but mainly savoury and then the crunchy texture of the vegatable with the soft, but not overcooked, bouncy noodles, compliment so well.  I just love when food has multiple tastes and textures.  Only gripe?  It got heavy and really oily at the bottom (that honestly could have been me who didn't fully mix).  The soup on the side was alright, wasn't all that special, but the taste was pretty light.  Overall, great place, one I'd be willing to bring other friends if I'm ever in the downtown area."}
{"text":"The noodles are so good! You get to see the guy making the noodles to order while you wait.  You can get thin, thick, wide and extra wide. Get extra wide!! It's so tender and made seconds before you eat it.  The service isn't the best and the broth is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Finally a fresh hand pulled noodle shop opens up in Toronto. After watching countless videos on YouTube of people posting their overseas adventure, this place really replicates just that. Love the glass window display that allows you to watch your bowl of masterpiece be pulled.   Went with both the soup and dry noodles. Thin noodles with the soup and thick for the dry. After eating both, I think I definitely made a mistake getting the thinnest noodles with the soup. Soup is rich in beef flavour. Meat is tender. The sauce that went with the dry noodles was nice. Will be coming back for more! Definitely feels authentic."}
{"text":"I first went here with my Chinese boyfriend as he said pulled noodles are great and I have not tried them yet. I was excited for the new experience.  Service - 9/10 they sit you right away and hand you the menus/take orders in a reasonable time. Always fast and helpful.  Environment - 8/10 great, loud but not too loud music of todays best hits. Seating is a little squished.   Food - 10/10 incredible homemade hand pulled noodles and simple menu. I love the jellyfish and tea eggs.   Would be back again and again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to come back and give this place a 5!! I ordered the same beef soup but his time I tried a thicker noodle but it wasn't cooked thoroughly. Everything else was great like last time, and even the chilli sauce was better in my opinion. The service was also pretty good despite what other reviews have mentioned.  I also got the tea egg this time and it was cooked well with lots of flavour!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of this place.  1) The entrance way was packed full of people - 5 people standing there and it felt super congested. I know it's not the restaurants fault, but it's not that difficult to ask people to form a line outside instead.  2) The place is super tiny. It was a mission trying to squeeze in between chairs to get to our table, and I'm not a big person by any means. Also add in the fact that it's winter so everyone has their giant puffy down jackets, adding to the congestion. Maybe don't add so much seating in a small place?  3) The window I was seated next to was literally covered in condensation, and the floor next to it was really wet. That's kinda gross and is a breeding ground for mold.  Finally, the food. I didn't understand the hype. If you blindfolded me and fed me noodles from here and any other noodle place I wouldn't know the difference. They just tasted like any other noodle shop over in Chinatown or Markham.  Their service was pretty indifferent too.   They have the appeal of fresh, hand pulled noodles,  but that's basically it. I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Food was great but seating was a slight issue. The place is small and you might end up waiting a little bit before seating."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Overall Experience: 4/5 Highly recommended! Just minutes away from Eaton Centre, bus terminal and Ryerson University. If you're in the area, you should give GB Hand-Pulled Noodles a try.  Food: 4/5 The menu is quite limited... two types of noodles, a noodle soup and a saucy noodle, and then a few side dishes. They have a small menu, but they do it right.   If you're someone who likes Pho or Ramen, I suggest giving this a try. I was worried about the Special Beef Lanzhou Noodles lacking in flavour based on the colour of the broth, however it ended up being packed with flavour. It's the type of dish to warm your body and soul. I could see myself wanting this while feeling under the weather. The small size is just the right amount, its not too much and not too little, you'll leave satisfied with a small. The cut of beef they use isn't the most tender, but still good. Oh yeah, can't forget the noodles! Definitely hand-pulled and made to order, and has great texture. I recommend the 2nd least thick noodle (called \"xi\") for this dish.  The Pork Sauce Mixed Noodle dish is the perfect balance of flavour and textures. Because it isn't a hot dish, it would be great on a hot day. The cucumber is a great asset to the dish, as it adds a refreshing aspect. I recommend the \"kuan\" noodle thickness for this dish.  For these two dishes, after tax and tip my bill was $25.  Service: 5/5 Wait staff are all very friendly and quick to come to your assistance. The waitress was gladly willing to offer her opinion on what thickness of noodles I should get. After seeing me struggle to separate my noodles, the waitress immediately came over and offered to cut my noodles for me without me having to ask. Because the restaurant isn't very big, the waitresses are often watching you eat. But on the bright side, the staff are quickly at your service. I was in and out within half an hour.  Atmosphere: 3/5 Restaurant is small and seating is limited to about 30 people, with a mix of table seating and bar-type seating. The restaurant fills up quick during lunch hours. With each order that comes in, the chefs will bang dough on the counter as part of their preparation, which can be very loud and catch you off guard at first. However you get used to it. Be warned, the floors are very slippery, especially if raining or snowing outside.  Tips & Recommendations: -Try the Special Beef Lanzhou Noodles with \"xi\" noodle thickness -Try the Pork Sauce Mixed Noodle with \"kuan\" noodle thickness -Lunch Break Friendly? Yes"}
{"text":"I came here for take out and ordered the beef noodle (with the widest noodles). The food tasted great and the staff were really friendly. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Omg amazing food! Went there for lunch on a Friday and the line up wasn't too long (11:45am). It was busy inside  and the line up was pretty even for eat in and takeout. Didn't take long to be seated. Got the pork sauce with max thick flat noodles (scrumptious!) and hubby had the beef soup with thickest round noodle and medium spice. Both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot serving authentic LanZhou hand-pulled beef noodles. The menu is small, only consisting of two different noodle options and a handful of apps, but they do these amazingly well! You can pick between 5 different thicknesses for the noodles and 3 different bowl sizes. I ordered the 2nd thickest option ('kuan') and a small bowl but it was super filling already. The broth is incredibly tasty and the addition of the chili sauce gives it a nice smoky flavour. You also get a good portion of beef that's very tender.  The place is pretty small though and has little to no A/C so this might be a better option for a cooler day. But the music playing in the background was great - like it was taken straight from my iPod!"}
{"text":"Ah a taste of home. When you are feeling hungover and only noodles can fill the void :)"}
{"text":"We got there at 7 pm on a Friday. It was already decently busy but we didn't have to wait long. By the time that we ordered, 3 of there dishes already sold out. They have a limited menu already, so there was t much choice of different kinds of noodles. But you can choose whether you want your noodles to be round or flat and what thickness. Otherwise it was a decently priced meal and it tasted good, so I would recommend!  Also, you get to see the guy at he front of the restaurant pulling the noodles, so you know it's fresh."}
{"text":"I went there on Friday at around 630pm and no line up which was great.   There are only two options for you to pick.  They keep the menu very simple and specialize in them.  The flavour is good.  Not too salty. I'd give it a 3.5."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday around 5:00pm. It's a very small establishment and by 5:30pm there was a line up. We sat at the bar. We ordered the kimchi, spicy cucumber, spicy beef shin, the potato and the marinated egg to start. All but the egg are cold appetizers. Good portions. I'm not really into preserved or pickled things (potato salad and kimchi) but my friend said they were tasty. I had the vegetable soup with thick noodles- yum! Noodles were chewy and the both is not too salty and has a nice kick to it. Service was quick and efficient. The manager or maybe owner came by and asked us how we liked everything. Would return."}
{"text":"FRESH made to order noodle bowls. Service was great and the staff was super nice! You can watch your noodles being made right when you walk in the door. The portions are HUGE! A small bowl felt like a large. If you are feeling extra hungry, get the MEGA bowl! The jellyfish was also very addicting. This place does not disappoint."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a conference and needed a hangover cure on my departure and this hit the spot.  The menu is small and the portions of the noodle soup are generous.  You can choose the shape and size of your noodle and add additional spice and flavor to your broth if needed.  Space is very tight so don't show up with a group larger than 4.  Their soup feels so genuine and warms the soul.  Will make a point to come back and visit in the future!"}
{"text":"Got there at 12:15pm and there was a line out the door. It was freezing out, but I had asked a friend to meet me here, so I decided to wait. The line did move quickly, but the door was such a pain! Every time someone opened it, it would stay open and it allowed all the cold air in. It definitely did not make the dining experience comfortable when you were sitting there freezing.   We had to sit with four other people at a communal table, and our waitress was quick to get our order and we got the food in under 10 minutes. Unfortunately because of the language barrier, we had a hard time asking questions, so we settled for what we understood in the menu.   I decided to  to get their regular dish with beef. Though I don't care for fatty beef. The portions are generous and the noodles are delicious. The broth was okay, but a tad too spicy - and I don't mind spice. My friend got the vegetarian option and could not finish her broth. We wanted to take it go, but we were not given the option and decided not to bother asking for a container.   I do hope to return, but in the future I will get the vegetarian option with chili on the side. I will also go during less busy hours. Maybe after 1pm or before noon."}
{"text":"Must try: LanZhou Hand-Pulled Noodles  There is basically no selection to speak of, but what they do, they do well!  I don't know what I appreciated more, the texture of the noodles or the clarity of the broth. Despite its looks, it's not too spicy (but there is chilli oil at every table so you can season to taste). The broth is very fragrant! You don't get sick of it at all! Noodles are chewy and flavorful, you can see them make it!  A small portion was more than enough for me.   My friend got the zhajiangmian and it was tasty as well. Would come again."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I bought the small size hand-pulled noodles and couldn't even finish it and it was only $8! The service was great - everyone was really friendly and attentive. Location is great too - it's right beside the Eaton Centre and Queen's Park so it makes for a nice lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Came around 11:30 and there were plenty of tables, but a few minutes later and everything filled up.  They were making noodles when we arrived and the children enjoyed watching until our meal arrived, which was very quick.  They proudly announced that they watched our noodles being made ( and the 10 year old wants to try making them when we get home)  everything was very tasty.  The children shared  small bowl of beef noodle soup and hubby and I shared noodles with homemade pork sauce.  The pork was amazingly flavorful."}
{"text":"In my view, this place is as good as it gets!   The food is consistently fantastic; the broth is always perfectly balanced. The noodles are delicious regardless of the size and shape you choose - they're not doughy, but they have the perfect amount of chewiness. It's also a nice touch that they're made in front of you.   My recommendation would be to forego any appetizer, and to go with as few people as possible. This will increase your likelihood of being seated quickly."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen!! Flavorful broth with beef and handpulled noodles that they make right in front of you! Only a couple of menu items where you choose the shape and size of your noodles. Service is quick and courteous. Great prices--$11.95 for a large bowl--I couldn't finish it! Only negative is that it is stifling--no air movement which is very uncomfortable when you're eating hot soup. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The place is quite small but ulplthe service is fast and accurate. We were seated within 15mins of arrival for a weekend lunch. You can watch the noodles being made/pulled while waiting for seats  The menu is small but tastes great! We got their jellyfish and beef shin apps - both were very good. The jellyfish had a crunch and did not taste fishy.  I ordered the noodles with homemade pork sauce (dry) with thick noodles. To be honest, I didn't taste any difference between these hand pulled noodles and other kinds of noodles. The portions were also huge"}
{"text":"Good soup base and noodles! Once the order is placed, the chef will pull the noodles and then boil it. Fresh as can be. The beef in the noodle soup was also very good and soft. The menu is very simple with one type of noodle soup and one dry noodle dish as the main course. You get to choose the noodle size you want from round or flat to its thinness/wideness. I tried both and preferred the thin round noodles. Their dry noodle dish comes with a savory pork sauce. Very good although if i had to choose between the two I'd go with the soup. The jellyfish appetizer & tea egg are also a recommended try. There was a wait when we got there but it was fairly short, about 10 minutes. Diners eat, pay, leave. Service is pretty quick."}
{"text":"This place is well-known for their hand-pulled noodles so I decided to try their freshly made noodles for the first time.  Being extremely hungry prior to arrival, you could only imagine what I decided to order - the MEGA bowl of noodles! I opted for the thin noodles and patiently awaited for my bowl, not knowing what was to come.  Then comes in my server... carrying this MASSIVE bowl of noodles and I could only blink twice before realizing that it was mine. I ended up finishing only half of it and had to pack the rest home. The noodles were so nice and bouncy. I loved the broth the most. It had a great beefy flavour. This was a really yummy bowl, but next time, maybe opting for the smaller portion would be wiser."}
{"text":"I love this place but often have line up. They still have the grand opening sign but i think they opened longer than a half a year. Prices went up lately. Will come back because i like the noodles but  prices a bit steep for chinese noodles."}
{"text":"The Lanzhou noodle hype is real and affordable! Stopped by on a weeknight with three people and the wait was about 15 minutes, which wasn't too bad especially since we could watch the chef make the noodles by hand. It was a small place so it's best for group of 4 or less.   I got the Beef noodle in soup in the second thinnest round noodle - $8 for the regular size was plenty to be full. Noodles were springy, toppings were generous, chili oil was on point, and the soup was flavourful but not overbearing. Service is efficient and interiors were clean with no-frills but that works for a place like this. A great addition to the Dundas/Bay neighbourhood - will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"So delicious!! Fast and easy... Oh, and it's hella cheap. What more can you ask for? They also have a vegetarian option, just ask for it! It comes with an Appy! No booze but there's pop and you can get a full meal for less than $10"}
{"text":"I love this place! Heard great things about this place when it first opened so I thought I would give it a try and see if it was worth the hype. I've been 3 times since. It's a small restaurant but the line moves quickly. I like how simple the menu - basically only 2 items and you get to choose the thickness of the noodles. My favourite is the thinnest flat noodle. Everything from the noodles to the soup/broth was just on point. Service is super friendly which was a plus as well."}
{"text":"There was a line when we got there but worth the wait. We enjoyed watching the noodle pulling while waiting. Amazing noodle bowels!!"}
{"text":"Amazing hearty bowl of delicious noodles made to order! You can see the noodle chef making one of their 6 types of noodles by hand as you walk in.   I had their small beef noodle bowl with broad noodles, and I was contemplating in getting a large bowl. I'm glad I went with small for the portion is quite generous. Their chilli oils aren't spicy, just adds another flavour profile to the broth and noodles.   My husband ordered their dry noodles with pork and shredded veggies, with his choice of broad noodles. The marination of the pork is flavourful and not overly salted. The veggies adds crispness and freshness to every bite of the chewy noodles.   Overall, service was good and the line goes by fairly quickly. We will definitely be back to try their other type of hand pulled noodles. It's amazing, and I wished the space was bigger to accommodate more seats!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here maybe 5 or 6 times within the last 2 months just to satisfy my craving. I love thick, chewy noodles so I usually opt for the first or second flat sized noodles (jo-ye or kuan). The broth is very light as compared to Japanese ramen broth. It is reminiscent of pho broth but less salty. The prices here are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. A small size usually is more than enough for me which usually costs ~$10. Vegetarian friendly -- my vegetarian friend is absolutely in love with their veggie broth.   I've tried other hand pulled noodle places in the area but this one is by far the best! Try to avoid high times to avoid having to line up (noon and dinner time). Can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"-Menu item: Special Lanzhou beef noodles ($9.99 for small, $12.99 for large)  -Taste: Broth was clean and flavourful, noodles were chewy,  and the beef was very tender. Portions were generous. -Atmosphere: Casual, small space, seats fill up quick so it is not an ideal spot to stay for long. Service was quick and friendly.  -TL;DR: We came here around 3pm and we were surprised to see how packed it was for an uncommon eating time. The noodles were simply delicious. We'll definitely be adding this to one of our go to spots for a hearty meal!"}
{"text":"Legit. Excellent quality. Select your own noodle girth. A couple 4-6 seater tables and a row of window-facing seats. Entertaining kitchen."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this \"hand-pulled noodles\" place. On Yelp it says they're open \"Monday-Friday 10:30am to 10:30pm\"..well I got there at 9:10pm and they're closed already. Wow what the fuck? Also there's no official website to know what their real closing time is! No phone number can be found anywhere as well. Will not be coming back. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"I'm curious what GB stands for... if anyone knows please feel free to send a message .  So the three star, the reason it is not a 4 because it didn't make me want to dance in my seat, where the taste and flavour overwhelmed me.  Yes, the seat jiggle is a perfectly valid gauge.  Also, the service wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst.  The worst part of this place is the configuration of tables so tightly packed that in order for tables who are close to the wall leave, the next set of patrons sitting next to them must also stand up--even when they are still eating.  Awkward at best.    I ordered the flat noodles in the Special Lanzhou Beef Noodle Soup.  The noodles were delicious and the soup was good, but not mind blowing.  The portions are quite large and the amount of meat was decent.  They do ask if you would mild, little, medium or extra spicy.  I opted for mild.   My friend ordered thin noodles in a vegetable noodles and braised egg (an appetizer is included in the veg meal apparently).  The broth was a bit boring--my friend added soya sauce and chilli oil but the noodles and vegetable were good.  There is a pane of glass when you walk in so you can see the noodle master pull the noodles, pretty neat.    Very Asian style, when you're done just get up and walk out the door (joking), head up to the counter to pay.   Besides for the awkward patron seating this place was pretty good."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Great for quick and cheap eats. Hand pulled noodle soup is tasty!! The small is very filling for the average person. One of my go to restaurants when craving soup noodles!"}
{"text":"Once I stepped into the store I could already smell the delicious broth. The star of the show are the noodles - I wish they had a few more sides in the noodle dish, there was just a few daikons and the beef. Nonetheless I will be coming back! Oh, I also ordered the kimichi as a starter when I was waiting and it was wayyyy too sour so I wouldn't get that again."}
{"text":"I ordered the small #2 sized noodle soup and my wife and daughter split a small ja-ja mein.  We also ordered a side order of jelly fish with sesame oil.  I have to say it was FANTASTIC. Watching the guy hand pull the noodles was a lot of fun.  How he can make it look so easy and make it taste so good is an art.  The broth was flavorful and not salty.  The beef and radishes in my noodle soup was a delight.  The ja-ja mein was equally delicious. Our jellyfish appetizer was seasoned very well with the sesame oil and slivers of cucumber.  Overall, this place is a KEEPER and incredibly reasonable in price."}
{"text":"This tiny restaurant is serving delicious noodles in both soup and dry form. You get to pick between several noodle types and spice levels. If you're there with at least one other person I recommend getting a bowl of each type form. The minced meat sauce and soup are flavourful without being too salty. The appetizers were both tasty and just the right amount for the price. The food comes quickly and there aren't too many frills otherwise. Very popular as there was a constant lineup once we arrived. If you're a bit skittish, be aware that the noodle creation process involves some loud slamming."}
{"text":"Pro: decent hand pulled noodles, chewy, good texture  Cons:  The little tables are all placed so close together so you have to constantly get up, pull your chair in, just to let the other customers get into the seats by the wall. It was at least 5 times. And the waiters carry the hot noodle soup over your head to those customers which made us quite weary.   Got really thirsty after our meal - it can mean only one thing: MSG is present in the soup.   The $8.99 chicken - very mediocre and not worth it for its value.   We'll both likely try something else next time."}
{"text":"Mediocre bland tasting noodles and did not enjoy the service."}
{"text":"A stone throw away from Eaton Centre, this is now my go-to destination for authentic noodles.  Great price and dish sizes. Small location but there's bar and table seats mainly for 2-5 people. Simple menu with two main dishes, a beef noodle soup and a minced pork noodle dish with soup on the side. Ordered both and they were mouthwateringly satisfying. Also, they were extremely generous with the portions. The mega size for the beef soup are not for the faint hearted - more than enough for 3 people.  As a person with many vegetarian friends, it's important to not there are no vegetarian dishes!"}
{"text":"This is a solid downtown option for hand-pulled noodles, only a block from the Eaton Centre. The place was packed for lunch but I got a seat at the window.  The menu has essentially two options: noodle soup with beef or dry noodles with pork sauce. I opted for a small beef soup. The portions are gigantic, a small was more than enough for lunch, and under $10. It was spicy too; the soup comes with a slick of chili oil on top. I like heat, but I was blowing my nose partway through with the regular spicy. Regular was fine for me, I wouldn't recommend extra spicy unless you're a die-hard chili person.  The noodles were dense and had a good chew. The beef was tender but lacked flavour. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very good beef noodle for a cold weather and friendly staff :) I got the MEGA!!!! Thumb up!!! Small place little wait but quick! Canada a must :)"}
{"text":"Great hand pulled noodles. I got their new dish which only comes in a large size and was their beef tendon noodles ($12). The broth was excellent and just the right amount of spice. Comes with a few halves of bok choy, loads of coriander and green onions, and a truckload of beef. I had thought they accidentally put extra beef in my dish but no, it's just like that. The beef chunks were tender and covered in a thick sauce that goes great when combined with the sauce. I also got the jellyfish appetizer and it was bomb. A great palate cleanser between spoonfuls of noodles and broth.  The service was great too, quick, friendly, and always made sure I had water/tea. The location is a bit small though with only a handful of tables."}
{"text":"The texture of the noodles are great and also fairly generous. Also, prices are very inexpensive."}
{"text":"I'm torn because I would really like to like this place and after the rave reviews, I came in saying that I'm really going to like this place. There's some good and there is some not so good.  The good: clean, easy to find and I like walking in and seeing the chef hand pulled noodler extraordinaire going to town on the noodle mass. He really showed them noodles whose boss with WWE style choke slams on the counter. At one point, I think I heard him say, 'Say my name noodle!' I digress....  I thought the broth was nice. It was quite flavourful and I do like cilantro so the little mount cilantro in the bowl worked for me.   The bad: The staff was trained by the ice queen. The option was tea or water upon being seated. The decision must the made fast lest the crazy noodle train leave the station. The noodles are decent but a little dough-ey for me. I got the size 3 and would have gone even smaller. I guess with hand pulling, the size is a little harder to control.   Overall, it was nice and it was entertaining but missed the freshness that pho offers. I ate it like Oliver Twist with my wooden spoon and I ate it like a champion!   I gotta say, the staff really needs to up the experience. Food AND service gets you the 5 star reviews. I may come back here because I'm still curious about the beef.   Oh wait, thank you to the waitress that brought me a new set of chopsticks right away when she saw me drop mine on the floor."}
{"text":"For someone who lives in Markham, this place is an \"eh...\"  With all the hype around this place, I found that there wasn't anything special about the place.  The noodles were pretty standard in comparison to Markham. If I was only rating this place for their noodles, I would have gave them a 4.  The biggest problem for me was the seating.  It was very crammed and it was hard to move."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I were hoping a new noodle restaurant would open in the area and our prayers were answered. The broth, the fresh hand-made noodles and the tender beef is just delicious. They offer a few side dishes that I have yet to try but will in the future.  The beef they serve is a sliced beef, we asked if they will be serving beef brisket and they said yes, in the future. The noodles are served flat or round and both are offered in three different sizes. I did try the biggest flat noodle and it was a bit difficult to eat so choose a smaller noodle for easier eating. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"We just moved to Toronto and have been here 3 times already. It's SO DELICIOUS! Recommend getting the tea egg & spicy cucumber apps before your soup!"}
{"text":"Deliciously fresh handmade noodles!! Very small inside but worth the squeeze. Noodles made right before your eyes! Broth of the soup was amazing and the large bowl was huge! Wish this was down the street from my house in California!! I will be revisiting when I return to Toronto!!"}
{"text":"I love their noodles taste very chewy will definitely come back again.  However I'll likely ask for less pepper next visit since I find it too strong for my liking."}
{"text":"After you've been sledding for 2 hours in the Toronto winter, a heaping bowl of hot noodles hits the spot.  We tried both the soup and the jajaingmyun (Korean description) style.  Go w the wide noodles.  It's a cramped and busy spot, but well worth it on a frigid day.  My 8 year old son says they were the best noodles ever."}
{"text":"This is a nice little chinese hand pulled noodle place. Though because of the limited space line ups can be long and service can be slow. Noodles are hand pulled on the spot because you choose the style of noodle you want. The soup is nice and clear. Overall was an okay experience cause waitress was pretty rude but the service itself wasn't bad. The food itself was good but not outstanding. I would still reccomend for people to go try because of the variety of handmade noodles they have."}
{"text":"I like this place! The portions are very fair first off. Even the small is the size of a large at many pho restaurants. I ordered the lanzhou noodles, which I've had at various places previously. The beef was very tender here, and I thought the broth was fantastic. Do let them put some chili oil and coriander into your bowl! It's a bit spicy but tasty. I think I'd ask for a little less chili oil next time. I ordered the medium wide noodles, which came out massive. I regretted not ordering super thin noodles because I feel that would've worked better because the noodles are chewier than most other asian noodle dishes so chewing through that 1.5 cm noodle can be tiring over the course of the meal.  The place is cramped and tables are pretty much right next to each other. There's also not a lot  of tables. One of the waitresses was giving tables the wrong dishes left and right. We got some random spicy cucumbers right after we ordered, which we thought were complimentary but upon investigation it was actually supposed to go to a couple eating at the bar area (we were sitting at a table). Very weird. Oh well, the food is good! So far, this is my favourite lanzhou noodle spot in the city."}
{"text":"Really fresh and chewy noodles with a yummy broth! Not expensive either ($8.99 for a small that is super filling)... pretty cool how you can choose the thickness of your noodles. Wish there were some veggies in it though."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try out this busy place for a while, so I took an early lunch and got a bar seat.  Ordered a small beef soup (spicy), it took about 20min to arrive but the wait was worth it.  The broth was light and tasty, the noodles fresh and springy, and just the right amount of spice.  I thought about that soup for the rest of the day, it was that good.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.  First off, GB Hand-pulled noodles as ABSOLUTELY AMAZING service. They notice immediately when our table is out of tea and comes promptly to fill it up. They ask if we want lemon water or hot tea kindly and with patience. I requested a take away container and instead the lady kindly asked if she would like to package it for me. Quickly and neatly, she puts my noodles away in a container and places it in neatly tied up plastic bag! Even when we are ordering, they take the initiative to ask if I want \"spicy\" or \"coriander\" in my noodles... knowing that not everyone is a fan of both.   \"No coriander? Oh me too, do not worry you are not alone!!\" - The waiter says with enthusiasm.  Love it!  Second off, although their menu is very limited (pork sauce noodles or lanzhou beef noodles + side dishes) the quality is excellent. The noodles are made right in front of you, the broth is flavourful, and even the side dishes taste really great! (The spicy cucumber in particular). Not to mention, the portion sizes are quite generous too. If you want a fair meal, two can split a Small bowl. If you want to feel FULL, two can split a large bowl. If you are REALLY hungry, tackle a large bowl. I seriously have no idea how people can even finish the Mega portion size.  To finish off the experience, they also give guava candy :D   Overall, GB Hand-pulled Noodles, though small and compact, is a wonderful place for comfort food at great price/service!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out because of its raging reviews but I'd have to give it a 3.5 stars.   Food:  We got both the noodles. (There's only 2 types) and they are very authentic and taste is great. The seaweed salad is pretty mediocre and portion isn't that big.   Atmosphere:  It is VERY crammed and noisy. The lack of space is what the restaurant could improve upon the most. The tables are within a cm next to each other and there's barely any space to move. Perhaps a better arrangement of the tables and chairs would be better.   All in all, it's an OK restaurant but the space is what got me the most."}
{"text":"Noodles are good and tasty. Always consistent and never disappoints. I go there often and will continue to. I recommend the beef noodles very good. Only downside is that their menu is limited but I always get the noodles anyway and it's always good."}
{"text":"Best Lanzhou Pulled Noodle in downtown. Great services, fast serving speed, quality Noodle with variety of selections."}
{"text":"The beef noodle soup was really tasty. The service was good.  Why it was only a 2 stars joint in my opinion? Three letters, MSG. I was so thirsty after eating the noodle soup. My observations: While I was having my delicious jelly fish appetizer, I saw the cook put 3 bags of powder in to the soup pot. I suspect they were part of the soup base (2 grey and 1 white). The texture of the noodles were really good. Unfortunately, the soup was a bit too \"tasty\"...  PS. Do not leave the meat on top of the dish washer. Please put them in the fridge or somewhere out of sight at least."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?  Their handmade noodles!! Really simple meal; choose from two different noodle bowl. Either with soup or a pork sauce that you mix into your bowl. What I loved the most was the ability to choose different size of the noodle! Up to 8-9 different options of the noodle size !! I opted the size 3 noodle with the right tenderness and chewiness. I would want to opt for a thinner noodle next time so the noodle soaks in the flavors even more. Really like the pork sauce and the soup flavour.   LAST TIP?  You may not be able to sit at a table when it's busy but there are lots of bar seats to sit if you don't mind. Don't forget to give the side dishes a try too. I recommend the jellyfish if you dare to give that jelly a try! You can opt to not have green onion or parsley in your noodle bowl so if you are not a fan of onion or parsley then don't opt for it!"}
{"text":"Apparently this is a brand new location. Usually, new places have lots of kinks they need to work out, leading to poor service and poor product coming out of the kitchen. However, this was not the case with this place. Here's what you need to know about this place.   Pros: - noodles really are hand-pulled. The chef at the front pulls them to order and drops them into a vat of boiling water.  - service is great. 3 waiters/waitresses running the show at this relatively small restaurant.  - big windows for a great view of the city and people outside.  - noodles come in classic round and more traditional flat. Flat is the way to go.  - they offer two kinds of noodles here. One is the noodles with the broth inside already, and I THINK the other is without the broth, but I'm not sure. Whatever the case, the selection is very limited, which leads to more focus on making the menu taste better.  - broth is light and delicious. Not a heavy dish, even with large size.  - the cucumber side dish is excellent as a taste refresher between bites of the noodles, kind of like ginger in sushi.  -HUGE pot of boiling bones for soup broth in back. Bomb.   Cons: - beef side dish more like cold jerky. Didn't care for it.  - tea egg is just OK. Not all that.   Overall a great place to try hand pulled noodles like the kin you've seen on buzzfeed. Average price for a meal here - 15$"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype of this place at all. Upon walking in there were two people ahead of us in line. First of all, we were not greeted - the cashier only spoke to the people that walked in after us in Mandarin, proceeding to help them. Maybe they had placed an order beforehand or had a reservation? Unlikely, but I'll give benefit of the doubt. Nonetheless, I had to speak up to be acknowledged and to find out how long the wait would be.  After waiting for about 5-10 minutes, we were seated. There was literally 5 cm between our table and the table beside us. Extremely cramped and uncomfortable.   The food came very quickly - I ordered the small special lanzhou beef noodle with extra thin noodles and my mom got the braised beef tendon with thin noodles. Both dishes had very salty broths, the braised beef had a weird and overly salty flavour, and the thin noodles in the second dish was undercooked. It tasted like stale dough. When this was brought to the waiter's attention he stared at me blankly and went to talk to the kitchen staff. He came back, only to tell me \"they say its cooked\". I tried to explain to him that I was aware it was cooked but that it was UNDER cooked and tasted like dough, yet he kept repeating it was cooked. When asked if it could be cooked longer he said no. In disbelief, I asked if they were just going to serve us undercooked noodles (I mean, it would probably give the consumer a stomach ache). At this point, another waitress comes by and takes the dish away from us. I would have expected them to at least replace it with a new, properly cooked dish but maybe my expectations are too high? They walked back and forth with the dish only to return five minutes later telling me once again, the noodles are cooked. I can't even.   We ate maybe 25% of the food and walked out. Some of the most unhelpful and ignorant servers I've dealt with.   I feel like people are just hyped about this place because you can watch the guy at the front hand pulling the noodles, but if you're familiar with the noodle pulling technique you would notice he's not doing it properly. He slams the dough not nearly enough times, which is what gives it good texture/elasticity."}
{"text":"Really great northern Chinese style noodles. Noodles had great texture and broth was flavourful with just the right amount of spice. The place is a little small though and their appetizer choice is quite limited."}
{"text":"Super busy Asian restaurant! I'm not sure if they have enough seating as they were in a corner in the wall. Great noodles though and the soup is heavenly! I recommend this top out of all the noodle soups I had before."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh noodles.  Delicious broth and all accompaniments are delicious as well!  We'll be back.  Small menu great for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped by because I saw it on Yelp! Enjoyed my bowl -- soup was good, noodles were delish -- will have to come back!!"}
{"text":"Went Sunday around noon, there was no line.   We ordered the minced pork cold noodle and the Lanzhou spicy beef thick noodle. The spice level was just right for the Lanzhou noodle. The only strange thing was that it had daikon radish in it, which I found to be bland and didn't particularly care for as a part of the dish."}
{"text":"Awesome little place in downtown for hand-pulled noodles! Noodles are prepared to your liking (round/flat, and thickness), fresh, and perfectly chewy. The broth is flavorful but not greasy. If you're not sure how much spice you can handle, ask them to omit it (the first time I went, the amount they put in was too spicy for me). There's hot chili oil at every table so you can just add it yourself. And if you're like me, ask for extra cilantro and green onions! They have a few appetizers as well but I found that they were nothing to write home about, and the Lanzhou Beef appetizer was a little dry.   This place is small and probably fits 20-25 people max. There's bar seating and there are some tables packed very closely together. There will likely be a wait time, but I found that it does fluctuate. I came at noon one Saturday and had to wait ~20 min for a table for two. Recently, I met a friend around 6:30pm on a weeknight and there was no wait at all (and the restaurant never filled up while we were there).   Bottom line - reasonable prices, filling portions, really good noodles for this side of downtown! Be prepared to wait to get seated, but it'll all be worth it once you cozy up with your piping hot bowl of noodles. And hopefully you don't mind hearing the people at the table next to you slurp up theirs!"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto from out of town and had to try GB because there are few things I find more delicious than a bowl of soupy hand-pulled noodles. These were good, but nothing life changing. The broth was a bit too close to pho for me, but the thin noodles were nice. Would not recommend the kimchi-way too sweet and saucy. Service was pretty bad. I had to really put some effort into flagging someone down to pay. 3.5 rounded up to 4"}
{"text":"Noodles are good but the dishes are way behind. Nothing special when compared to any average noodle."}
{"text":"Hand pulled noodles made to order!!  I would still rate it 4 stars even though they raised their price by $4! It is unusual to find a place with this quality downtown at this price. The soup base of the noodles is amazing and definitely one of the cleaner Chinese (lam Zhou) noodles place in North America with decent customer service.  Absolutely worth waiting in line especially during the cold winter in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Have been to GB a few times. The menu is simple. Basically the same noodle soup base with meat. The selection is with or without chillies, size of soup and the thickness of the noodles. It is very popular and always line up at lunch (never been to dinner). Soup base is flavorful. Noodles are handmade and quite tasty. I like it enough that I have been back a few times but I usually avoid peak times and go a but earlier or later.  They do have other small items as sides as well"}
{"text":"I've been to a few places like this most recently bring kung fu noodle in Markham and GB came through on the noodles!  The options are simple, in beef broth or with a pork based sauce. If you go with one other person do yourself a favour and get one of each! Share it, love it. The best part was choosing the noodle thickness (obviously went with the thickest). They were so chewy and soaked up all the flavour. This place did not disappoint!   We also had the house made kimchi and that was surprisingly tasty. Don't expect the traditional Korean kimchi though, this version is much more vinegary (I happen to like it that way )"}
{"text":"It was okay... super hyped for no reason.   Came here on a Tuesday afternoon around 2PM. My friend says there are usually line ups for this place, so to my surprise, there were at least 6 empty tables at this time - so we didn't have to wait (and I only had an hour for lunch anyways). We were greeted and seated immediately and handed the one page menu. Very brief and simple, not many choices.   My friend and I both got a small noodle bowl. The size was decent, and the noodles were made fresh (very uneven though, some thicker and wider than others, and clumped up in bunches). The soup however... maybe it was my taste buds being altered by being sick, but boy, the soup was super salty, and tasted like boiled tap water... I did not have the stomach to finish the rest of my bowl as I hated the taste tap water.. let alone hot tap water!  Although this was a neat place to try out... it's more like a once in a life time sorta deal. :P"}
{"text":"Bit better on 2nd visit, broth was better, noodles properly al dente, cut of beef is very lean and tough -- dont like.  Cramped seating.  Would get takeout in future, not dine in."}
{"text":"Service was quick and courteous and we got to witness our  noodles being pulled for order which was totally awesome! The texture of the noodles were absolutely brilliant. My only critique is there is only one veggie option and the broth lacked flavour so all I could taste was the chili oil."}
{"text":"I found this hidden gem under Hot and New , as I was looking for dinner options. WOWZA!! My noodles were being pulled by the experienced chef right in front of my eyes, and then within minutes, my \"small\" bowl of Special Lanzhou Beef Noodles was on my table. Be warned that their small is the normally large bowl found everywhere else. All the ingredients danced in my mouth. This is just the perfect dish for this cold, and rainy night here in Toronto. The menu is really simple. Two main dishes to choose from. The Special Lanzhou Beef Noodles ( the noodles is submerged in the broth, or the Noodles with Homemade Pork Sauce (dry noodle-style with broth on the side). One other choice you have to make is the thickness of your noodles. The thicker the noodles, the more chewy it will taste in your mouth. Simple right? Check out this place asap because soon, waiting in line will be the norm for a bowl of their delicious hand-pulled noodles. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best beef noodles hands down! Staff are amazing, and the spicy cucumber salad rocked also Nuff said"}
