{"text":"We ordered 3 burritos and we had to wait 20min. 
Too much salt. No vegetables. No service."}
{"text":"Well done burritos, reminds me Mexico.  I ate the Chile relleno burrito and it's awesome, it's not too spicy. The tortillas are superb! Very good price for each meal. Definitely I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Clean environment and friendly staff! The burritos are priced low, but are not gigantic in size. I'd say your average person could eat 2 depending on your diet (or lack thereof). I ended up having their RCB burrito and a quesadilla. I was sort of expecting more than just meat in the burrito, but to my surprise the brisket held its own while complimented by their freshly made tortillas. The quesadilla was also quite tasty as I paired it with their green salsa. Overall, I had a great experience and will be back to try several more burritos. I don't suggest dining in, especially around lunch time as the space is relatively small. I see this place expanding soon as business seems to be booming for them. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is an okay place, the good is their tortillas are some of the best I've ever had. I also love their chile relleno burrito. However the green chile burrito didn't have a lot of flavor. I mostly tasted the meat but not much sauce.  The bad is, they are constantly running out of their chile relleno burritos so you are forced to pick something else or leave.  That's happened to me multiple times, way more than just a few times... I think if you list an item on your menu you should make enough to supply the demand for it."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to love this place. I had heard so many good things--plus it is right down the street from us. But alas, it did not live up to its hype for me. Perhaps we went on an off day but the tortillas were practically raw and the meat used was extremely fatty. Not my cup of tea. I honestly couldn't even finish my RCB burrito."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Authentic Mexican food - stop your search-  You'll find it here."}
{"text":"they have the best burritos ever and the whole staff is super nice and friendly best costumer service ever and everything there is to die for"}
{"text":"The freshest food I've ever had at a fast food joint. This place is what I've always dreamed about! Fast, great tasting food and great prices. Their menu is simple, delicious and varied. No filler junk food here! Great amounts of protein and flavor. This is my new favorite place to eat!!

Back again! This place is the best in the Valley, hands down!!!"}
{"text":"Great little take-out burrito shop. The RCB is very tasty. Would be 5 stars if they added some sides to their menu. It is just burritos currently."}
{"text":"This is a great place for take out lunch.  Fast, fresh, great tasting food, and reasonably priced.  Everything I've had has been very good... especially the cheese quesadilla!"}
{"text":"The food is good. I do have one problem, the online ordering was $0.29 more expensive than the same order in the store. I don't know where that error is coming from. It was an order of 4 burritos (RBC, Chile Verde, and 2 Bean & Cheese)."}
{"text":"I saw this new restaurant on a Facebook group I am a part of called Ocotillo Friends. Everyone raved about it and I have to agree! The prices are amazing for the quality and quantity. The variety of flavors are unique also. I heard the breakfast burritos, which are served all day, are awesome. But I love the Carne asada and the Chile verde. My husband loves the mole and barbacoa. I would have given it a 5 star but only gave it a 4 because they often run out of items. I have tried to order the Chile relleno every time I have ordered  (about 4x) and they are always out. But that could be seen as a good thing too! They are new so they need time to adjust to the ordering I think. But it is definitely worth giving this one a try!"}
{"text":"They have really good burritos!  I tried the mole burrito and the chile verde. They were tasty."}
{"text":"Great burritos. I've loved everything I have tried but especially like the RCB and the Chipotle pulled pork. The corn was good but there is an awful lot of butter in it so I've only gotten it once."}
{"text":"I really wish I would of see all the reviews first before buying this small expensive \"burritos \" Never Ever will go to this place in my life . The \"burritos \" should be named roll tacos instead . Don't waste your money in this HORRIBLE place . Unsatisfied ex-customer.  Zero rating ."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fantastic service and great prices!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good I've been looking for a place that has a home style taste that filibertos or other places don't and this is it good burritos friendly staff and it's even better that I found out about this place through Yelp"}
{"text":"I have to say, I've been here only 5 times now, but I'm ready to give them 5 stars.  I thought the Barbacoa burrito was amazing, until I tried the Chipotle Pork.  So very awesome.  If you are anywhere in this area, it is a must try."}
{"text":"First time at Rita's and I have to say, I'm a fan.  We tried a Chile Verde, carne asada and a bean and cheese ( you know, for the kiddo ).   I think my favorite was the Chile Verde but I really liked all three. We will be definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Wish their hburritos had more options to put in besides just meat. I would love lettuce and sour cream in there! Their Barbados burrito is very good, but would love to be able to add sour cream and lettuce!"}
{"text":"I eat here on a regular basis!!  LOVE this place!  Food is excellent, lots of flavor, and great value for your money.   Everything on the menu is excellent, and tasty.   Clean, friendly restaurant run by local family!!"}
{"text":"The burritos here are amazing! Simple but great! I think it's the fresh tortillas that they use that makes them so scrumptious! I've tried the turkey breakfast burrito and the chicken one. No complaints with either!"}
{"text":"Fabulous place. Burritos are authentic and delicious!!! Workers are super nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"The burritos we've tried are all delicious and my kiddo devoured the quesadilla every time! 
Staff are also super friendly and helpful and the food was made fresh to order and super quickly"}
{"text":"Awesome simple burritos!  Glad to have found this place.  Great flavor, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Kudos! See link for Grade \"A\" from Maricopa County Health inspection. http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-contributor/2016/12/28/restaurant-inspections-9-phoenix-area-restaurants-weeks-list/95872740/"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while driving through town. Very good burrito. Ingredients appear to be high quality. Tortilla was very tasty. They say everything is made fresh here. Great customer service too"}
{"text":"Tried Rita's for the first time today and was not disappointed. We were greeted warmly and the service was friendly and fast. The line when we arrived told me it was going to be good but it moved quickly. The flavors of the chipotle pulled pork and the carne asada burritos were incredible!  Fresh hand made tortillas only added to the wonderful taste. I can't wait to go back and try other flavors!  Great low-cost option for Chandler!!"}
{"text":"The burritos are always very tasty (Chile Verde is my personal fav), prepared quickly and always fresh, but due to the small size for the price I cannot give more than 4 stars. If the burritos were a little bigger or a little cheaper (so two wouldnt cost $9-$11) this place would be five stars."}
{"text":"I've had the basic breakfast burrito with egg and sausage and it's totally legit. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Nothing is better than homemade food!  From the delicious tortillas to all the ingredients. Delicious!!Gilbert, the owner is a seasoned pro in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Took my daughter  then my mother here.  Loved the tortillas  made on site.  Had the Carne  Asada, chili verde, and steak quesdilla.  Loved the flavors.  Come early or late because they get busy!  Many people left as I ate.  Need to see tortillas."}
{"text":"With all the good reviews I was excited to try this place. Unfortunately it wasn't anything special. I thought it was weird that they didn't have sour cream or guacamole. When we asked for it the workers reply was \"we aren't chipotle\". I'm sorry I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Small family owned business with amazing burritos! Homemade tortillas are fantastic. I highly recommend the chile verde burrito."}
{"text":"One star because there is no negative star rating, really should be.
If you like tastless items wrapped in good tortillas this is the spot.
Not just bland, this was a tastless chorizo burrito, so much so that I questioned if there was any chorizo in at all. There was a little something that looked like chorizo but the egg and potato mush must have overwhelmed it. My coworkers had similar experiences. All of us ordered burritos of different content and no one was satisfied with the quality of any part of the food.
At the time of our visit there was not fountain drink options, just bottles, not really an issue. There is really no indoor seating because the 2 very very small tables that are inside are in the way of those placing orders at the counter. If you happen to find one open and don't mind someone's butt in you face as you try to eat, go for it.
As we waited for our order we noticed a couple seated at 1 of 2 little bistro tables having what we initially thought was a couples disagreement, not really loudly but obvious in a 20 square foot space. What we quickly learned that it was the owner chastising an employee, right there in public. Wow, unprofessional, but wait, there's more.
We received our food in reasonable time and found 1 of 2 little bistro tables out side along the sidewalk, sort of in the way of walking traffic but options short of getting it to go are limited.
With 1 or 2 bites into our burritos we had all confirmed that we would never return to this place and would make every attempt to warn all City employees to steer clear.
Here's what sealed that feeling. The owner, the one berating his employee was unloading supplies from his car, in the midst of lunch traffic lite as it was, generally being in the way. He had to make a few passes by our table so maybe this is what motivated his visit or maybe it was obvious to see that no one was finishing their burritos. He asked how our lunch was and since I am the unofficial municipal lunch coordinator and as a \"professional eater\" I expressed my very detailed disappointment, point by point. My coworkers expressed similar opinions.
Ready, here's the kicker, the owner's response was, oh well, it's not for everyone. Not I'm sorry, could I offer you something else. Not, can offer you a refund or a partial refund. Not even, is there anything at all that I can do. Not even, I appreciate you opinions, even if he didn't mean it.
So, in summary, the food sucks, the environment sucks, and the owner is very very unprofessional not only to customers but to his employees.
Maybe it's the uniforms."}
{"text":"Other than being muy disappointed that they were out of Carne Asada, we were pleasantly surprised and pleased with our choices of brisket wrap and barbacoa burrito.  Two previous food tenants in the space failed, so we hope people will patronize Rita's enough for them to succeed.  The food is very good and the prices are very reasonable for such high quality."}
{"text":"I am addicted to their bean and cheese burritos! Add some cilantro and onions and I'm in heaven! Best tortillas! The $2 price makes it even better!"}
{"text":"Love it and burritos are excellent. Usually get Chili Verde because it is hard to select something different when you find something you love. Visit every Saturday with my son as boys day out. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. It's a little far from us so whenever I am near here this is my go to. It really doesn't matter what burrito you have they are all good. I usually eat 2 burritos and am full by the end. I would love to see them add desserts to the menu! Overall, the owner and staff are great as well."}
{"text":"Amazing! Nothing else to say, quality and freshness is the best thing about this place! Great people and service! Love this place! One of my favs"}
{"text":"Great food, Great service, clean clean clean  restaurant that doesn't smell like cleaning solution. Bacon & Hash add green Chile & beans ooooooo its the boom."}
{"text":"I usually never write reviews, but this place-- I had to. We tried it when it first opened and were not impressed, so if you tried it then I would encourage you to try again.
We gave it another try & im so glad we did. Their food is amazing. We have tried almost everything on their menu. If you are not a meat fan I would recommend their bean & cheese or chile relleno.. I'm not a pork person, or really a meat person, but their Barbacoa was amazing. I never get meat at restaurants because of their quality & taste, but Ritas meat is amazing!! Such great quality. I definitely recommend their breakfast Barbacoa or just Barbacoa. Love their red sauce. But at the end of the day, any choice you make will be a great one-- bc those tortillas are heavenly! Coming from a Mexican family, those tortillas are even better than homes. Must try :)"}
{"text":"I got the bacon and hash burrito and it was really delicious. I was just hoping for a bigger burrito but it's great for the price and most importantly it was delicious! The customer service is also exceptional!! The lady at the register was wonderful."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place tonight. When I was reading the menu online and seeing the prices I thought \"well, these burritos will be tiny and I should order one of each!\" They are normal sized and just amazing prices y'all! They were delicious! So much so that my picky 3 year who had already eaten dinner earlier in the evening went round 2 and ate a bean and cheese burrito to himself!  

We do have an absurd amount of leftovers, but will be coming back soon I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Finally a good burrito place. Moving here from New Mexico meant leaving behind some amazing food. Although their are places in NM which could rival or perhaps be better, this is the best place I've found in AZ BY FAR! 100% totally worth it and very very good!"}
{"text":"Rita's burritos are delicious! We really appreciate going in and helping such a great local business. In May, my husband and I got married and were hosting a brunch the next day.  Even though it was a Sunday, the owners personally delivered approximately 85 burritos to the house. This service of going above and beyond, was incredible. It is definitely worth a try if you haven't been yet. 

In the evenings we also have had their quesadillas and various wraps. We just keep coming back thanks to the homemade flavors and fantastic customer service. The owners are incredibly friendly, great at remembering every customer and it's great to support a local business with such friendly owners and fantastic food!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible... horrible horrible horrible by far the worst restaurant I have ever eaten at and we eat out a lot. Truly a bad place.... ick is all I can think . We didn't even finish our food.
Everything was dry , the tortilla crumbled, the meat was tasteless , raw onion piled on and overpowering. Disgusting I could eat better anywhere ..."}
{"text":"If you've never had the priveledge to be in a kitchen where fresh tortillas are being made with the burrito fillings being cooked then this is that spot. The place itself is small and tucked into a shopping plaza. During lunch hours it's busy but the service is super fast. There's no fridge in the place which means everything is cooked fresh! The folks working here are friendly & will give suggestions when asked. I ordered a carne asada & chorizo with eggs burrito. Both packed delicious & fresh flavors. All burritos are made to order and they come fast! The flavors of the burritos were so good, the red & green sauce added great flavor to it as well. This is definitely a place you should visit!"}
{"text":"Rita's is a great local burrito shop. You can tell the food is made fresh and comes from a family recipe. The Chipotle Pulled Pork burrito is hands down their best burrito and my favorite. Spicy, savory, and a hint of beer that it simmers in; I get it every time. I strongly recommend you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome - chorizo and hash is the best - green chile is wonderful - owners are welcoming and I wish they would build another location in Gilbert !!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and friendly...what else do you need? From the fresh tortillas to the mouth watering chili verde...you can't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"Delicious chile verde on a freshly made tortilla. At $3.75, it's the best deal around! The service is friendly and quick. I'm so happy to have a new local spot with fantastic food."}
{"text":"The Chili Relleno Burrito is honestly the best thing ever created!!!  Homeade tortillas are amazing, I tried to buy all of them haha!! Gilbert is the best, thanks for the amazing burritos!!"}
{"text":"Great casual and fast burrito (mostly) to takeaway. Tortillas are made on site and as fresh as it gets. It is meat and tortilla, very simple menu which is great! Salsas are spot on and freshly made. That is it: simple, fast, fresh, and delicious! Just like their slogan."}
{"text":"These are some of the best burritos I've had. Starting with a fresh made tortilla and great flavorful meat. Very affordable too! The chile verde is my favorite. Glad we have this so close!"}
{"text":"Their carne asada burrito is just steak and tortilla. No guac or pico here. The gal at the counter explained their rationale as \"we want the flavor of the meat to stand out\". Unfortunately, for us, it didn't :("}
{"text":"Based on the high reviews we stopped by for a quick bite. It's a small little shop with friendly staff. We tried the Chile Verde burrito, RCB burrito and Chile Relleno burrito. We liked the Chile Verde and the other two is no bueno. I will definitely come back again to try their breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Everything is fresh made right in front of you! I've been coming here ever since they opened and the menu just keeps getting better as it grows!  I love the Bacon Egg and Hash breakfast burrito but I'd say the Chili Verde is a favorite! But you should put potatoes in it with cheese excellent!! And the owners are wonderful the staff is great and services is quick!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite take-out places. Some days when I'm running around like crazy with my two kiddos, I call ahead and order our usual and it's waiting for me when I arrive and of course, always so satisfying.

i ALWAYS order the chipotle pork.. it is the freaking best flavor of pork. I have tried other burritos, but this one is MINE :) I do not deviate.  My kids happily eat the bean & cheese, the shredded beef and the carne asada.  We pick them up on our way to the park and my kids have a handy protein packed burrito for after playing and climbing.

I love that their burritos are SIMPLE. No fillers of rice and beans and this and that.. naw, I like just a meat burrito.  I order it for the meat.  Personally, I order it for the 5oz (yes, I've measured freqeuntly) of pork I get for my money.. the best damn tasting chipotle pork ever."}
{"text":"Awesome burritos.  The bean and cheese is less than $3 and is always freshly made and delicious.  Both the red and green sauces are fantastic."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food place.  Nobody make green chili or bean burros this tasty!!!  Our family has been going there over 30 years.  They had one on 59th Ave but it closed.  Very sad about that!!"}
{"text":"I predict 2016 will be a big year for Rita's.  Prices are very reasonable, and quality is very high.  I had the RCB and it was wonderful.  Be sure and pick up at least 2 sauces per burrito if you like your burrito on the hotter side.  Their red side sauce was excellent.  I enjoyed the green as well.  I do have two recommendations for the owner:  you should sell your delicious flour tortillas by the 1/2 dozen - I really love the home made taste.  Also, you should offer your red and green sauce in 1/2 pints and pints.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the sauces, too!"}
{"text":"Ive tried several burritos from Rita's and they are all great! They are light but very filling and don't leave you wanting to take a nap after eating! The fresh ingredients make Rita's stand apart from other local burrito shops and have earned my business!"}
{"text":"Edit: 22 down 253 to go.
GREAT homemade burritos/tortillas/sauce. They have about 15-20 items on their menu (mostly burritos) and that's all you need. Get 2, because 1 is never enough. I recommend the Chile Verde, RCB or Chipotle Pulled Pork. The owners and staff have always made me feel welcome. I'll be back at least 275 more times."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast burrito (egg, bacon and hash browns). The burrito was fresh and the ingredients were very tasty! Quality food for a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Green Chile burrito was simple but full of flavor and the green sauce on the side completed it! Love the side of ocotillo corn as well, again simple, but full of flavor!  Sometimes you just don't need all the ad ons other places have, when the filling is great, that's enough! 

Will be back for sure! So glad I discovered this little place!"}
{"text":"I just moved from Chandler to California a couple months ago... and I don't think I've ever been sadder.  This place is literally so fantastic I honestly considered driving 10 hours just to eat here. I ate here like 3 times a week. It's sooo yummy, made from scratch and absolutely delicious... so so so much better than the filibertos or Los Favs chain type places. I wish you guys would branch out. We could use some Rita's Burritos in SoCal"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a burrito after you've run a 5K and the drank a 12 pack of beer, this place is for you. It's probably good anyway, but even better if you're drunk and hungry. Cinco estrellas!!!"}
{"text":"Rita's has a super easy online ordering system which I recently used to place an order. I was super excited to try the place out, as red chile is the reason I draw my next breath. 

As I was heading to pick up my food, I got called away to an emergency and couldn't pick up my food at the scheduled time. Two hours later I called to see if I was too late to pick up my lunch and the employee there told me the food was thrown away due to how long it had been sitting out (Totally cool- they don't want anyone getting sick, which is awesome).


It didn't occur to me at the time to ask if my meal could be re-made, or any other options. I called two days later and explained the situation to the man working- and he couldn't have been nicer. He provided a variety of remedies and provided outstanding customer service. Even though I haven't had the chance to sample this great food- based on their great customer service- I am a fan! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"New Mexicans!!! You won't have to travel six hours or have your tia make you tortillas! This place is amazing! Everything is super fresh and nom nom! I got two bean burritos and red chile pork. So bomb and cheap too! I ate all 3 today:) totally hit the spot grab some red sauce!"}
{"text":"Burrito was good.  They could really benefit from fountain drinks though.  The 20oz only option is a turn off.  Not much seating."}
{"text":"Chef/Owner Gilbert bringing his grandmother's recipes to the masses brings a whole new dimension of yumminess to the East Valley. Every item is packed with delicious, bold and layered flavors of complexity and harmony!"}
{"text":"Recently discovered this gem and so far have been there a few times since! This place is rather small with a few tables inside and outside. You place your order at the counter and within a few short minutes your order is up! Super convenient for a lunch break! 

Now, if you are used to burritos that are bigger than your head, this is NOT the place for you. Their burritos are rather slim and usually only filled with the meat and maybe cilantro and chopped onion. This place does not do fillers in their burritos like rice, beans, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, and the like. For some people, this can ruin their day. For me however, it's the way I make burritos at home, and I love it! The flour tortillas are also freshly made and are excellent. The kitchen is open so you can see what's going on. 

Between my husband and I, we normally will order three burritos. We each eat one and split the third  in half. 

Definitely will continue coming here, as it reminds me of the burritos my mom would make and I grew up eating."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great little place outside of the Phoenix airport. It's obvious that the locals know it's good by the lines waiting to pick up their orders.

Not knowing what to get the person taking orders suggested the green chili enchilada, with their red sauce.  It was absolutely amazing.  How do I transport this wonderful small kitchen of gastronomic delight back to the east coast?  The flavors and texture of the meal were so good, and the spicing brought my nose to running. 

Note that they are really only a take out place.  They do have a few small tables outside, but in 105 temperatures one would appreciate some air conditioned space to enjoy their wonderful food."}
{"text":"We recently moved about 45 min away, and we still find a way to get our Rita's Burrito fix almost every week! 

Now we make sure we have a quesadilla to tide us over for the ride home! They're cooked perfectly with an amazing cheese... mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is great.  Tortillas are fresh and burritos are tasty.  I gave it three stars because they don't have pico, sour cream or guac to add.  If you don't ask they won't put anything in the burro but the meat.  So make sure you ask maybe if everyone keeps asking they will add it to their menu."}
{"text":"We ordered two burritos and split each one; barbacoa and chipolte pulled pork.  They were extremely tasty.  We enjoyed the barbacoa a little bit more.  The ingredients were fresh and the made to order tortilla was one of the best we've ever had.  Fresh and made to order makes this place a hit."}
{"text":"Quality food but super affordable. So good! The tortillas are heaven. Fast and friendly service. Both the green and red salsas are amazing and unique."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place...I am no way near a \"picky eater\".  Decided to give this place a try for the 1st time. 1st thing I noticed, it was an EXTREMELY SMALL establishment..if there is more than 3-4 people in there, you will be very cramped and even hard pressed to find a seat to sit..after you order your food, there is no where to even \"move over\" to let the next person in line order...I felt really uncomfortable. The gentlemen who took my order welcomed me and was very friendly. I ordered the Carne Asada and the Barbacoa...after a short 6-7 minute wait my named was called and I took my order out to my car to indulge. Took the 1st one out, and my 1st impression was WOW, this is kinda small....took a bite, and immediately notice this thing was dry as a bone...let me open this thing up and lets see what goodies are inside...to my surprise, only thing in this \"burrito\" was a few small pieces of over cooked steak...THAT WAS IT!!!!   No rice, no beans, no lettuce, no tomatoes, no cheese, no sour cream..NOTHING, 1 ITEM!!!  Thank God there was a Wendys across the street, I ordered a fountain drink (O YEA, no fountain drinks at Rita's) and asked if they would sell me some sour cream and cheese...they gave me both for free. I immediately started putting it on these \"burritos\" to try to salvage any hope of having a good lunch. I did enjoy the Barbacoa a little bit better, at least it had a hint of onion and cilantro. It wasnt a bad experience, I can see if someone is wanting a small, light lunch, this would be a great place to go, unfortunately, when Im hungry, I want a meal...sorry, this place isnt for me."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and I ordered the RCB. Soooo good. I wish it was a little bigger. Reminded me of the kind I could get in New Mexico. I Will be returning to try other menu items. The prices are decent too."}
{"text":"I went to this place two times. The first experience was very good - burittos were tasty and hot. The second time around it was meh because freshly made tortillas were undercooked and tasted raw, the meat inside was barely warm, they did not even heat it up properly. I may give this place another chance since the first time it was perfect."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here and they were awesome. Everything was super flavorful and on point. We ordered a bunch of different items and I don't have one complaint about them. Love their green salsa. Their Barbacoa breakfast burrito was delicious. I love their carne asada. We'll definitely be back. My super picky girls loved the quesadillas. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Best clean kitchen burritos I've ever had period. Staff is friendly and I always refer people here.  Burritos see prefect size to have two different burritos per visit."}
{"text":"I have to say that the only good thing was the tortilla it reminded me of when i was a child and my grandmother always made them fresh i wasn't to fond of the Carne asada just meat no nothing.  ??? Taste was good but it wasn't filling. Most liking i wont be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Simple easy menu, great prices. Always fast and friendly. Perfect spot for a quick lunch break! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"These have to be the best burritos I've had in AZ since I moved here 11 years ago. I was blown away by the amazing fresh tortillas. I tried the Barbacoa and Chile Relleno burritos. Both were perfect. I brought three coworkers with me and everyone loved the food. We are definitely coming back here again. It was worth the 20 minute drive to get to Rita's."}
{"text":"Just got the simple dan burrito. Although very simple it was excellent. The carne Asada was very very good. Will return and recommend for all. Way better than chipotle or any other burrito place around this area. And it was very fast which made it nice on my lunch break."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Rita's restaurants in the west valley many times, and their food was very good, so I was happy to find a Rita's in Chandler near my home. I tried them out today and found that the food was good, and the prices were very cheap, but the size of the burritos are very small. I tried the chili verde burrito, and when I finished I was still hungry so I ordered a carna asada  burrito. After eating the 2nd burro I was still not very full. Both of the burritos were just filled with meat. There was no Pico, guac, or veggies. Their hot sauces were not that great. They have both a green and a red sauce, and both were very thin. 

I guess it back to Burto's. One $6 burrito fills you up more than 2 $4.50 burritos, and you get several sauce choices."}
{"text":"Well well well. This place is a little hidden gem. The tortillas are to die for. The food inside said tortillas is good. I had a bean burrito and chorizo and potato potatoes could've been a little more crispy for my like but I'm a picky. If I were you I would get one in your mouth asap."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now. All the burritos we have tried are great. Love the barbacoa and chili verde. Our kids love it, too. Owners are very friendly. Need to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"yum!  and cheap.  didn't think the chicken they used was of the BEST quality, but I liked the flavors."}
{"text":"Awesome! Ingredients are fresh and masterfully marinated all wrapped in homemade tortillas, which by themselves you can build a restaurant around. All this for just a few bucks! Everytime I'm in Chandler I will stop by for at least one breakfast burrito and one carne asada burrito!"}
{"text":"These are not your standard chain burritos. I had the Barbacoa Burrito... very straight forward ingredients... (beef, cilantro and onions on a homemade tortilla)... Great flavor! My wife had the Chile Verde Burrito... (jalapeño sauce, green chilies and pulled pork on a homemade tortilla)... also Great flavor! For a side item we had Corn Ala Ocotillo. Awesome! Will definitely be coming back again and also want to try the breakfast burritos. Would be great if they had a true vegetarian option in the future as well."}
{"text":"I was a long way from home today and stopped to bring home some burrito's. This place did not disappoint. Really loved the chile verde pork the best, but the beer and chipotle pork was also right there. Did I mention the fresh tortillas?  Enough said. 

I wish it was closer so I could eat there on the regular. The prices are unbelievable for the quality as well. This is a family owned joint and everything is fresh. Excellent people, recipes and food!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday with my grand daughter and it was excellent. The pulled pork is the perfect spicy!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Burrito were made with fresh flour tortillas. The chile relleno one and barbacoa were amazing. I would recommend adding aguacate and sour cream as options.. otherwise a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Haven't found good red or green chile until now. I love his place. My wife and I tried it and people said small size burritos. Not small at all. Plus the place is clean. I love spicy so to me it has a small bite. For the non chile waters. Beware. Peel the paint off the wall hott."}
{"text":"I love Rita's. My favorite is the chorizo burrito. I have sampled the other types but they were a bit dry, not what I'm used to. The biggest thing is the amazing owners and what they do for the community. This is a business that takes care of their employees and really stands by their items. They hand roll out tortillas every day instead of factory pressed ones. I appreciate it, because I had never had such soft tortillas before! I think most people aren't used to the fact that this is not a Chipotle where there are all sorts of toppings. Literally meat and the tortilla."}
{"text":"Chile Verde!  Good, clean n fast service. Ordered Mole & Chile Verde burritos. Only Chile Verde is good, not impressed with Mole. But Chile Verde burrito does not comes with vegetables. They don't serve beans on the side for additional fiber...so, eat more fruits & veggies else where. 4 stars for Chile Verde."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast a few mornings ago. I've had a lot of breakfast burritos from many different places and have to say that the tortilla sets up the whole burrito.  That being said, the fresh tortillas here are legit! They are awesome. I gave it three stars solely based on the tortilla.  I have to say that the rest of the burrito was disappointing. The bacon and hash was way, way too salty and had lots of pepper. It really made the burrito hard to eat. I'm curious to try another type of burrito, but not sure I'll be wanting to take the chance.

After a few more visits, I'm happy giving this place 4 stars. The breakfast burrito I've tried again, and it wasn't salty, like before. Other burritos I've had are also pretty good."}
{"text":"I tried the Double H burrito. Super thin burrito. That about 7 pieces of meat that were super rubbery and could not eat. Toritilla tasted fresh but other than that there was nothing really notable about this burrito. No flavor whatsoever and would not get it again.
Extremely disappointed since I have several friends that have been raving about this place. Perhaps this was just a fluke and should I go back I'd be happy to update my review/experience."}
{"text":"Went to Rita's Burritos on Saturday morning for breakfast. The eatery was tucked away in a shopping center on AZ Ave. and Ocotillo. The person at the counter was very friendly. My husband and I both had the bacon hash burrito and he also had a bean and cheese. The ingredients were very fresh and the tortillas were hand made and very delicious. We sat outside at a table, the inside was full and the owner came out and made it a point to ask how the food was.
The only draw back to this Resturant is the size. Also, the burritos were a bit smaller then I am used to, otherwise very good."}
{"text":"Stopped by because I heard great things. Ordered breakfast egg as bacon and hash burrito. Not impressed. Very little flavor. Very small portion for the price of $3.80 (after tax)."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, service even better!  You have to have Jorge as your waiter/ bartender! He has a secret margarita that is simply amazing!! A must try"}
{"text":"Great for a Quick grab and go. For a  small little burrito café it's quite delicious and it's very clean staff are very friendly and knowledgeable about the food .Had that RCB burrito we added hatch green chilies very flavorful and juicy lots of meat no need for salsa. Love that it wasn't a ton of shell like most burrito places . It's  a very small eating establishment great to grab and go. They are very quick for being busy. Handmade tortillas."}
{"text":"Fast, Fresh. Homemade tortillas. The Chipotle pulled pork is one of the best burritos I've ever had."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this great place.  Love love love their burritos from breakfast to supper.  If you're looking for take out food and you live in S. Chandler, you really owe it to yourself to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Updated review. I am a regular here pretty much at least once per week. Chipotle pork is my favorite, a little sweet and a little spicy. Chili Verde is also really really good. I alternate in the Dan add chilis, cilantro and onion and the Barbacoa is fantastic. They have some outdoor seating and we are usually able to sit. The fresh homemade tortillas are soft and delicious and meat is always on point, really well seasoned and very tender. Owners are great people and fun hosts."}
{"text":"Fantastic little burrito shop across the street from Hamilton High. The two biggest draws are the homemade tortillas (makes a HUGE difference) and the small portions. I know that sounds like a drawback but it's actually really great. You don't feel stuffed and it frees you up to get a couple different types of burritos for variety. I tried their Chile Verde, great portion ($4), moist pork, smoky sauce). Definitely coming back and trying every item!"}
{"text":"Most delicious burritos I have ever had. Would recommend the turkey eggs white if you're looking for something light. Everything is so fresh and yummy, amazing prices."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great portion size for the price. Friendly owners and staff.  My favorites are chili verde and barbacoa.  So good!!!"}
{"text":"Meat was very tasty, size was quite small.  I could have easily eaten two burritos to fill me up, which would have been quite expensive for what we are talking about here.  Everything is pre cooked like Chipotle then assembled to your specs (not a lot of specs to chose from either).

All in all, good taste, not so great value."}
{"text":"Burritos are really good. The flavor of the flour tortillas is probably the best I have ever had outside of Mexico. I'm a serious mexican food snob and many places in Phoenix I dont like. Had Ritas today with our crew at the shop and we all loved it! Dont expect a huge burrito like most places. Here it is the meat and the flour tortilla to showcase the tortilla flavor but the carne asada was awesome! Loved this place will be back many more times."}
{"text":"We love this place!  It is simple, but that's the beauty of it!  The flavor in each of their burrito's is amazing.  One of my favorites is the bean and cheese believe it or not.  The green chile and the RCB are awesome.  The breakfast burritos are great as well!  These burritos may look small, but I can barely finish two of them (and I'm a pretty big eater).  I usually buy 5 or 6 then put a few in the refrigerator for later.  A minute or two in the microwave and they taste great.  I've had them 3 or 4 days later and they were still fresh, but probably wouldn't go much longer then that.  Keep up the great work!  We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"I'm going out on a limb here giving a 5 star review after one visit, but hey, this review is one of those \"hole-in-the-wall\" alert deals. 
Tell me, where else can I get a mole' burrito? 
Anywhere? 
Take a look at their options (if my picture is high res enough). You don't get variety like that anyplace else.
The food was great, service was quick and the owner, Gilbert, even came out to chat a bit. As much as I love CostaVida, no chain is going to give you that.
As to price and size - frankly, I'm tired of other Mexican eating places with their monster burritos stuffed with the same old boring ingredients. The smaller (and cheaper) burrito is fine.
I'm going back and trying everything on the menu.
That should say it all."}
{"text":"Rita's is the fo-shizz and I don't give five stars lightly.  The tortillas are straight out of old town San Diego and the meats are succulent perfection.  My favorite is the chile verde with extra green salsa.  The prices are amazing and my only negative is that the burritos are so good I have to start getting two at a time!"}
{"text":"We grab burritos here all the time. Usually, we just get bean and cheese because they are delicious and priced right. But, we have had many of the other options as well. Always good. The people are friendly and the service is quick. The sauces are really good as well. This is the kind of place that should be sucessful."}
{"text":"Great food and tortillas are amaaaazing. 

Wish they had rice. We go here and then across the street to Filibertos to get rice to go with it.

Oh and staff is super sweet!"}
{"text":"This is my very favorite burrito place. It's locally owned with family recipes and HOMEMADE tortillas made right in front of customers. Mario, Gilbert, Darcey and the team are amazing. Such a wonderful addition to the Chandler community. The green chili verde burrito is top notch."}
{"text":"We love this place! The burritos are fantastic and the staff is incredibly efficient... you get your food quick but it isn't \"fast food \". I always get the RCB burrito and my kids love the carne asada burrito. I wish I would've found this place months ago..."}
{"text":"Omg!! This place is as fabulous as all the reviews say it is & EVEN BETTER!! Everything is so fresh. The owner came out, checked on us and gave us a brief history of their philosophy regarding their love of fresh ingredients. I wish I could give more stars!!! Seriously, so good and the added personal touch made this place perfect! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thank you so much for such awesome burritos!! Off the hook!!! RCB is the best burrito!"}
{"text":"I went with the Chorizo Hash & it was amazing!! I love the homemade tortillas! Watching the ladies preparing the burritos was awesome. The green sauce is where it's at!"}
{"text":"I just had my first experience with Rita's burritos! I tried a bean and cheese which was amazing and the fresh made tortilla was a cherry on top. But then I ordered the chipotle pulled pork burrito never in my life have I had a better Burrito! Lil messy but worth every bite. I would ask for it to be double wrapped next time. 
 But as far as taste it doesn't get any better! I was like a party in my mouth!!!"}
{"text":"Always nice to discover a new place when I visit my in-laws in the Chandler area. Be aware that these are not Mission-style burritos or \"burritos-as-big-as-your-head\" style burritos that are stuffed full of all kinds of things. To me, that is a good thing. These are very simple burritos made with homemade flour tortillas and the filling of your choice. I had the pork verde burrito; my wife had the barbacoa. They were both deliciously moist and well-spiced, with a killer knock-out tortilla. Simple and perfect. There's a choice of red and green salsa on the side, and I especially enjoyed the red. Despite the objections of some reviewers, I found the portion size to be adequate and the pricing fine. It is smaller than those everything-but-the-kitchen-sink burritos, but I was fully satisfied after just one of these."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fast service.  Heads up...the chile relenos go quickly.   Call first if you want particular items."}
{"text":"I was excited for this place to open because I work across the street and there's no where to eat around here!! So I tried them after a couple days of them being open and yes they are very good burritos but the meat to a fresh flour tortilla ratio disappointed me, I thought maybe because they're just starting out, so I tried again and it was the same small ratio again, even though the tortillas are amazing I rather have more meat and egg or even some cheese then pay $3.00 for a tortilla with 1 egg and 1/4 lb or chorizo."}
{"text":"best tortillas.  They just need to be a little bigger.  The cheese quesadilla is the biggest rip off...too much for hardly any cheese, but everything else is tasty."}
{"text":"Best green chili burrito I have had.  Little hole in the wall place with no real place to sit but great burritos.  Not the big huge type that are stuffed with rice and a little meat in the middle.  A good sized burrito for the money."}
{"text":"I've now tried every burrito on Rita's menu. All of them are out of this world. The chipotle pulled pork has always been my favorite, but the mole is what prompted me to write this review. I don't even like mole. This burrito has change my life. #TeamMole"}
{"text":"Super small place, made for take out. Best burrito ever!!! Chili Verde with hatch green chili - just amazing. Great service and options. Can't beat it"}
{"text":"After swimming class with my son, my wife suggested this place nearby that had amazing reviews with regards to their burritos. We ordered the Chorizo Hash and the Mole burrito. I will start by saying the employees/owner were VERY nice and treated my son really well. Sadly, the burritos themselves weren't to my preference. While the tortillas were made fresh, they tasted too doughy. At the price they were charging, I was hoping for more inside the burritos themselves. The sauces were pretty good (decent kick). 

Overall, for the price I feel you can get better burritos elsewhere, but if you're in the area you should give them a try."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in until you skip out the door with your burrito sack stash, you can't help but feel welcome at Rita's Burritos! My sweet friends, Gilbert and Darcie Meraz, together with their friendly staff, greet you with warm smiles, flour dusted aprons and even hugs (when they're not too crazy busy completing customer orders and catered events).

Starting the day with a breakfast bacon, chorizo or Barbacoa burrito is the perfect way to satisfy your morning hunger pangs! Get back there in time for an affordable lunch with their pulled pork, Barbacoa or any of their other delicious burritos and wraps! Why would anyone stop there when you can really \"elevate your burrito game\" with dinner to go with some of my favorites of mole, RCB and turkey and whites?

I almost forgot to mention: they make their own tortillas in house fresh!!! Plus, all of their ingredients are never frozen and freshly made every day! How awesome is that?

In all your excitement, before you walk out that door, don't forget to grab some sauce and napkins (you know, in case you can't wait to get home and start eating in the car). Otherwise, safely buckle your burritos in the seat next to you to protect them from accidents and any delirious hunger pangs you just can't bear to resist!

I also can't forget to mention how generous they've been to the community! They've done several fundraisers and do more feed the hungry programs than most other companies I know! They've got the biggest loving hearts how could anyone not want to support them?

It's such a refreshing change to have a small family run local business right in your own back yard! So happy you're finally here to feed us all!!!"}
{"text":"I got a chorizo hash burrito for $3.50 and loved it! It wasn't huge like at other Mexican places, so I was satiated without feeling disgusting when I finished. Perfect size and really tasty."}
{"text":"I saw Rita's Burritos profiled on a local morning news channel and figured I'd give it a try. The burritos were very good, but the home made tortillas are out of this world! The carne asada was very tender and juicy! My kids liked their egg and hash burritos. The price is right, the service is very fast and the employee are very friendly! Will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"I have been to Rita's multiple times and have had pleasant experiences up until today. Food is amazing! We were in there this evening picking up dinner and was surprised to have such an uncomfortable experience. The cashier gave rude and uncomfortable stares.. not only that but she stood there blowing her nose. Without washing her hands she handled our food. It was disgusting! We will be back but we were disappointed with this experience."}
{"text":"Burritos are good . Small for sure , around same size as the breakfast burrito at McDonald's , only much better tasting , no fountain drinks is weird too"}
{"text":"Very good burritos & fast service. Only criticism would be that the burritos are small when compared to other nearby places their quality is slightly better but not near the bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Little hidden place in a plaza had a great reviews. I decided to give it a try, and they owned up! It wasn't a huge menu, but they had just what they advertise, burritos! They were a bit small (compared to competitors), but they were also a little more affordable too. It was definitely quality of quantity here. Tasted great!"}
{"text":"False advertising on their menu, I was deciding between our usual Rubios go to restutaunt or here and we decided to go with Ritas because they had Chile raleno burritos. After the purchase they told me they do not have it and I could either change it or cancel. To much of a hassle."}
{"text":"First time here  The Burritos are a little different but really good. I'm used to burritos with more than just meat on the inside. Will definitely go back and try again and this time add some toppings."}
{"text":"Tried this new hot little spot today since there's been som hype about it on the social networks and I can say that it did not disappoint! Staff was friendly and the kitchen was open concept so you could easily see the cleanliness in the back. I had the Chili Relleno Burrito, a first time experience to eat a CR that way, and it was fantastic. The tortilla was clearly made from scratch and the cheese was piping hot and delicious. My friend ordered the Barbacoa Burrito and reported that it was very tasty- the meat being seasoned well. 
I will be back for more and was slightly disappointed that I had eaten a snack before I came here as I would have tried the RBC! Go check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time but definitely not my last.   Green and bean burritos are just like homemade.  Definitely better than any fast food joint.  The service is excellent.  FAST AND FRIENDLY!!!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I grew up in El Paso, Texas & Los Angeles, California and being from there, it's  safe to say that I have been exposed to some delicious good ol' fashion burritos in my time between  the two places. This place is worth the visit.  You'll come back guaranteed.  

Great selection of different types of \"typical Mexican street \" burritos.  Fresh home made flower tortillas are awesome.  Try the breakfast Hash burrito. They have different  fillings, pork, verde, barbacoa, the bean and Munster cheese burrito was my daughter's favorite.

Place is small and busy with many people in and out picking up to go orders.

I'll back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Love small businesses, as we walked in could see tortillas being freshly made in the back, simple menu, delicious choices, and reasonable prices, the taste was OK, kind of bland, the potatoes taste kind of weird, also don't forget to tell them to add cheese because their burritos don't normally come with it! Cheese is free of charge btw"}
{"text":"Went to Rita's for the first time Saturday morning. They make their tortillas fresh in house and they are amazing. I had the bacon and hash and it did not disappoint. Food was quick and super cheap. $3.50 for my burrito. $2 for the bean and cheese burrito. My only complaint is their hours. They close early and are not open on Sunday's."}
{"text":"So here is the deal, hands down the tortilla is good here since its freshly made. But you can not be a burrito place with no pico and guac. 

The burritos are cheap but then again it really doesn't have much in it..

There are no list of things you can add to the burrito... 
I get the steak(carne asada) it has big chunks of it which I like but it only has steak...

Steak and tortilla is not really a burrito..
No cheese, no lettuce, no pico..."}
{"text":"I arrived 5 min to close and overheard that they just ran out of tortillas, but they stayed open for an extra 15 min to make the tortillas & burritos for me and my wife!  They were amazing! You can't go wrong with their marinated pork and carne asada! Delicious! Of course the tortillas were fresh and yummy as well!!! Thanks Rita's!!!"}
{"text":"Really nice simple homemade burritos. Great to grab and go. I really enjoyed the chili relleno burrito. It's not something I have seen many other places."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!  The staff was so thoughtful and kind.  The burritos were simple but you can tell that is how they want you to eat them...and they are correct!  Literally the best burritos I've had in AZ and will definitely be back.  Would give 7 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Gilbert and his staff are fantastic! There is nothing like a freshly hand rolled tortilla and pork green chili verde! Absolutely in love!"}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada, very plain and boring. In the regular burrito you get nothing except meat. Their sauce is too spicy that they give and the steak was full of gristle. Bleck."}
{"text":"WOW!! This place is great !!! I really wish I had a picture to post however I know how DELICIOUS they are and I eat my burrito(s) right away.
I usually write a review on my 4th visit to make sure I'm being fair and not judge on the first visit. This is NOT Chipotle or Filibertos, if you want a  burrito stuffed with rice and lettuce this is not the place for you. They take pride in their food and you can see it....literally you can see how clean the kitchen is and how they make the tortillas in front of you! I hope they open a location in Phoenix soon to avoid driving from Phoenix to Chandler on the weekends."}
{"text":"Excellent burritos. Since it's in AZ I gave it 5 stars. If it was LA, it would get 4. The home made tortillas sealed the deal. I was a little shocked they didn't sell chips but the quality of the burrito made up for it."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and I must say the burritos were delicious....I am simple when it comes to burritos and prefer not a lot of toppings so this place is perfect for me!!! It is more of a grab and go place since not a lot of room but hopefully with such good business they have they decide to move to a bigger location. Highly recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"I used to work near here and LOVED the burritos here! The green chili pork one was my favorite. Tortillas are always so yummy and the salsa is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! So so good! We'd heard great things from everyone who'd been here and of course their reviews support that praise. We walked in and were greeted immediately by a very pleasant young man who was experienced enough to know that we were first-timers so he took the time to give us some information about their process and products. Lots of great things on the menu and when we finally made our choices we were NOT disappointed! The food was wonderfully delicious! The burritos were very very filling! I had the studio fit burrito and I would so get it again! A thumbs up all the way around - location, environment, food taste, quantity, and quality, and service. 5! 5! 5! 5! 5! 5! 5!"}
{"text":"This location lacking. Customer service is not a top priority. From walking in they only have a few seats. Placed and order for asada burrito, it came with the tortilla and the steak nothing else. I asked about other toppings and was told you could customize it for .50 a topping, nice to know this after I ordered. Ordered Diet Coke was told they only had one and it was for another order, so got a zero. 

The food came, it was a rather small portion, I ate it, and still wanted something else. Their menu is good but again no mention that you can customize it. 

I fear this is going to be another place in this location to disappear."}
{"text":"I wanted to get a quick bite to eat after shopping at lowes, I dint have a pleasant experience there when it first opened but it had been well over a year since I had been back so i decided to try again. Sure enough it still sucked, chorizo and hash had ZERO flavor and it was more of a taquito than a burrito. For the same price you can go to senor taco in the same plaza for twice the quantity and quality."}
{"text":"Recently ate at Rita's for a quick lunch. I had not been here in quite awhile, and decide I wanted a burrito and stopped off here. This is a very clean family owned restaurant where you are getting home made food. You can see them rolling out the tortillas and making everything in front of you. I know the owners of this place (neighbors) and they are nice and very involved with making the food from scratch and working with the customers. Limited seating inside and out side, so take your food to go.
Small amount of items on the menu, but that serves a really good purpose of being able to deliver good quality food. They offer breakfast burrito's and lunch/dinner burrito's. I really like to chile  verde burrito (my favorite). Very reasonable prices for good quality food."}
{"text":"Their Burrito game is crazy strong!!! 

I have been wanting to try this place since the opened and holy moly why did I wait so long.  They promote fresh food done right and trust me they deliver. 

I tried to order the Carne Asada Double H and they were sold out at 3:30pm. While I was bummed I couldn't get my Carne Asada on, right away I knew when they say fresh they mean it. So on to the next choices.

I settled on a Chili Verde, a RCB (brisket in a NM RED CHILI), and just to try it a Choizo & hash. All great choices and easily repeat orders. 

You can watch them make your burritos right behind and the tortillas remind me of home. Everything was packed with flavor, not greasy and  so delicious I almost ate my hand!!! I would have taken a picture to show off, but couldn't slow down eating to take it. Sorry I'm not sorry about it!! Lol 

These aren't your baby in a tortilla size burrito so if that's your thang, this may not be for you! 

Everyone was friendly and eager to answer questions. 

Can't wait until I return. The motto on the back of their shirts read \"Step up your burrito game\" and they don't lie!!"}
{"text":"Been curious since it seems every time I turn around I hear someone ask, \"Have you been to Rita's Burritos?\" You gotta go. So off we went for dinner to go and ordered, quesadilla, RCB,  chipolte pulled pork, and a bean/cheese burrito. The tortilla is made fresh, very good, everything we ordered was exactly as it read on the menu. Very basic, two sauces to add if you choose. I am guessing since I am not of the Mexican decent I'm thinking maybe I really have no idea what authentic Mexican food is like. I found the meat burritos greasy and dipping sauce, the bean and cheese was fine and just that, and the cheese quesadilla that same- plenty of salty craving taste.  I may go again but it is not part of my preferred meal fare of some fresh sides...so if you like mexi authentic fresh I guess this is the place. FYI don't plan on eating there- two tables and some chairs, its more of an order to go place....they'd probably do real well if they had a side drive through, It's comparable to In-N-Out (burger) Burrito Style but a lot less choice...."}
{"text":"Ok I believe Rita's just opened and on a recommendation we went. It was late afternoon and I had already eaten my late lunch. But my wife was very hungry just getting off of work. We got there in the store said sold out. Not something you see very often but can happen for a new business. Well I'm happy to say that the people there were extremely friendly they opened the door for my wife! They kindly explained that they had such a large volume of business that they ran out of most everything but my wife was so hungry and asked if they could make anything...and they did! Very happy to write this as being the first review because these people are very nice and the food is very very good! It's great having a place like this and people like this in our neighborhood and we will be sure to come back many times! Thank you Rita's!"}
{"text":"These were the best burritos I have had in a very long time. The meat was amazing. I had one that was a braised pork and one that was a red chile meat of some type. I am sorry I don't remember but my mind went numb after eating this little piece of heaven. I almost rated a 4 star because the burritos are a little small but then remembered that they are only about $4 and at that price I got two. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Well my bill was $6.81 for burrito and a bowl of corn.only 3 tables in side and 2 outside. But where they cook is 5 times as were u eat.
No folks, no knife, no salt, no pepper, no guacamole, no sour cream. It only takes one no 4 me 2 not go back.but I'm sure the high school across the street will keep them open."}
{"text":"SUCH a great burrito place! I love the bean and cheese along with the green chile burrito, sooo yummy!! I'm Hispanic so I'm very picky about Mexican restaurants but this one is just so great, you can just taste the freshness of the tortilla! And I read some reviews on how people said they're \"small\" or \"expensive\", let me tell you that 3 dollars for a authentic burrito in Chandler is a steal. It's a perfect size, and if you eat a lot then just order more! Plain and simple. Great costumer service as well. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy freshly made burritos this is the spot.  Every burrito is made from scratch including the tortilla that they roll and cook right in front of you.  Since they have opened I've tried the Chorizo & Hash, Bacon & Hash, Breakfast Barbacoa, Bean & Cheese, Chipotle Pulled Pork, Chile Verde, RCB, Mole and the \"the Dan\" Double H Carne Asada. I am partial to \"the Dan\" as traditionally I am a Carne Asada fan but my favorites have been the Chile Verde for the lunch option and the Chorizo & Hash for the breakfast option but you can't go wrong with any of them.  I was also surprised with the amazing flavor of the Chipotle Pulled Pork and the Chicken Mole.

The owners are amazing people and they truly understand what fresh, homemade, delicious food is all about!"}
{"text":"Holy shite was this good! I had the chili verde and chili relleno burritos. They changed my life and that's a good, cuz' my life sucked before I walked in that door. Your life probably sucks too, so get you arse through that door and begin your road to recovery!"}
{"text":"Run, don't walk.  Fantastically delicious burritos in home made flour tortillas...I had the Barbacoa stewed in an New Mexico red chili sauce -best I have ever had!  Can't wait to go back and get their chili relleno burrito...thanks! Rita burrito is my new go to place when I am in town"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times in the last week. The burritos are great. They have a nice variety of burritos, my favorites being the chorizo with hash browns, and the chile relleno burrito! Always friendly faces when you walk in the door!"}
{"text":"The chipotle pulled pork was tasty but the carne asada just tasted like plain unseasoned steak. The tortillas are fresh and melt in your mouth delicious.  I thought the corn side dish would be corn on the cob style, but NO. And  make sure to stir it before you eat or you'll end up with a big gob of mayo at the bottom of the cup. The burritos are REALLY small...like really. And they are plain...just meat and a tortilla. I wasn't even offered salsa. Definitely not worth the money they are charging. To give you an idea of how small they are, 2 of them fit side by side on the short side of a paper lunch bag. I added pictures."}
{"text":"The Molé makes me yell out olé! Great, fresh food made rapido. So good we ordered another round. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Crazy good! Not your traditional rice and bean filled type. These burritos are reasonably sized and full of great flavor. Love the chipotle pulled pork and my wife loves the green chili pork. 
Recently they added Mexican style corn which is amazing. Great price for great food."}
{"text":"I got the bean and cheese burrito. I thought it was ok, nothing special. Very limited seating. Place was very clean. Staff was very friendly. I would like to go back and try something else. The prices were really cheap."}
{"text":"We LOVE Rita's and visit frequently...probably once a week.  So why 4 stars, you ask?  Being a frequent patron, I must say, I feel like the Customer service is starting to decline.  One of the many things I love about Rita's is they are fast.  Sometimes they have my order ready before I even complete my payment.  But that seems to be if the owner is on site.  Lately, he seems to be there in the first half of the day and the service is excellent.  But whenever I go there and don't see him, the employees seem to be having a bit too much fun and are not concerned with getting their orders out quick.  It's easy to notice too, since you can watch everything being made. The quality and quickness are compromised when the owner is not there."}
{"text":"Have to love a place that makes its own flour tortillas from scratch.  The place is somewhat hard to find tucked in a mall.  My only complaint about the chili verde burrito is that while it was stuffed full of pork I didn't see even one green chili in the burrito.  It was still tasty but I just expected a little more.  One suggestion would be to beef up their soda offerings or maybe include some authentic Mexican beverages."}
{"text":"This place was a HUGE disappointment. :(. It got stellar reviews, but I cannot for the life of me figure out why. Don't get me wrong, if you are looking for a quick bite, this place could be an option for you- I'm not saying not to go, just that we didn't like it. I would put this on the same level as KFC. I could get a tastier burrito at Taco Bell... It was small portions (fine, whatever) and bland. The corn seems canned and the beans are dried. We won't be coming back, but you are welcomed to try it for yourself as everyone is different. PS Service was nice."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, they closed pretty early and I had been wanting to try them. Last week, we made a stop to a juice shop and I saw they were not only open but busy. I ran in and glanced at the menu thinking they were probably going to be $10 \"gourmet\" burritos. 

I was wrong but I gladly admit it! The choices were so different and the prices fit everyone's budget!  I ordered:
Bean and Cheese Burrito- my picky daughter said it was probably the best bean and cheese she's ever had! 

Chili Relleno Burrito- my husband loves them so why not in a Burrito! Great concept and he was upset that I didn't buy two, they were that good! 

Mole' Burrito- for some reason, most AZ Mexican food establishments do not have mole' on the menu much. When I saw this Burrito, I ordered it as mole' is so delicious and traditional Mexican fare.  One word- AMAZING! Cured my craving! 

Clean, fast, friendly and budget conscious but the burritos are dang good!"}
{"text":"I am from New Mexico, which means I NEED hot/spicy in my everyday meals. I've been searching and searching around Arizona and I finally found the perfect spot that sells the most AMAZING Relleno burritos with the perfect amount of spice! They even have hatch green chile, which I LOVE! Please visit this place. Everyone is so kind and welcoming and the food will make you stay!"}
{"text":"Visited today for lunch and enjoyed the turkey wrap. This wrap is flavorful and a great value for the cost. Although there was a line of about 10 people, we still managed to place our order and get our food quickly. Keep in mind there is very limited seating."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place five stars because the owners seem so nice and the tortillas are awesome, but I've been here 3 times and the fillings, at least for the breakfast burritos, just could use some seasoning and  a couple of ounces more added. My teenage daughter felt the same way. She didn't finish her Bacon and hash brown burrito because she thought it was a little too bland. I liked it enough to finish it for her,  but we both do happen to like a little more robust flavor."}
{"text":"What a great experience... the help was nice, the food was fresh and tasty... Its a little far for me to drive but this place is worth it. My new goto comfort meal place"}
{"text":"Fresh, simple, homemade, delicious. This is not your run of the mill burrito shop.  Fresh made tortillas, delicious meats and sauces without the fillers like rice and beans. Love that they keep the menu limited so they can do everything just right. Super clean and really friendly and quick service. One of those places I wish I had in my hometown Seattle."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend them. Gilbert and his team went above and beyond for our work event. The breakfast burritos they made were amazing and at a  great price."}
{"text":"Best burrito EVER! Me and my team get burritos almost every week, they're in homemade tortilla and taste amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is actually authentic just like my nana and tias used to make. The staff is friendly, food is reasonably priced too. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place could be top notch and definitely has the potential. There approach is the simpler the better and don't get me wrong it pretty good. There homemade flower tortillas are to die for and the Barbacoa was good but very plain no sauce or any thing to enhance the flavor. My only negative feedback is the proportion are extremely small for $4-$5 dollars, the size of a dollar burrito at a chain Mexican fast food restaurant. They can knock it out of the park if they get more creative and fix the proportions. I would pay $9-$10 for creativity and proportion."}
{"text":"Good food. Recommend theRCB and quesadilla . Good service. Reasonable prices. Check the hours as they close a little early ."}
{"text":"Tasty, fast, friendly and clean. Flour tortillas are made fresh every day as are the meat options. They also give free samples if you're not sure what kind of meat you want. The burritos are not too big but they are satisfying. Limited seating inside and outside."}
{"text":"Only place outside of Texas that I see makes handmade tortillas!!  Just the tortillas are worth the visit, however the burritos here are amazing.  They are also cheap! The bean and cheese burrito is just $2.  With such fantastic food and cheap prices you can't help but love this place.  One note is that there is not much indoor seating so if you plan to eat indoors to avoid the heat, you might be disappointed since you'll have to sit outsides.  Then again these kind of places are designed for to go orders.  While there isn't much seating indoors, the restaurant is clean and the employees here are super friendly.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! The burritos are fantastic, the staff is really friendly, and everything is very reasonably priced. Plus the my have Hatch Green Chile, which is the best."}
{"text":"Epic! Pure Epicness in a flour tortilla, this is another gem spot thanks to yelp, had the chorizo n hash, the chorizo was full of bomb flavor but not greasy? Is that even possible? Apparently it is here, then I had to go back like 2 hrs later tried the brisket burrito, holy smokes! Taste buds blown! Super lean brisket but super moist, is that even possible? Yup! Gonna try em all!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Wonderful customer service. Fresh ingredients!!  This is one place that will definitely become a favorite."}
{"text":"Fresh. Tasty. Quick. Friendly.
Went after the lunch rush on a Friday on a whim, first thoughts:  the space is small but open, clean, and bright.
The menu is simple, the options range in price from $3-$5
I asked the friendly lady at the register \"what is the burrito I *should* order?\" She recommended the Chile Verde burrito and I didn't hesitate to order it. A few minutes later it was in my hand.

The tortilla was fresh, the delicious and tender pork was mildly spiced. 

It was great and I wish I had ordered a second and grabbed some hot sauce. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites places to grab a quick bite to eat. I always request carne asada burrito with beans or a green chili pork with beans. The quesadillas are tasty with muenster cheese and freshly made tortillas. The restaurant is family owned and they alway so pleasant to me when we come in. If you are in the area I highly recommend Rita's burritos."}
{"text":"The description I would give for their burritos is America Home Made. They are not the typical  large over stuffed, multiple layers of toppings. It's about half the size and price of traditional Mexican fast foods. It's fresh, and stuffed with lots of meat. Very clean. Easy to pick up and eat. I very nice change from the repetitious Mexican restaurant burrito."}
{"text":"More often than not, less is more, and Rita's gets it. 
Their menu is as concise as it is unique, but bursting with flavor and variety. Service is fast and impeccable, place is clean and minimal, and prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Tried this place once at a friends house when he got a handful of these burritos to go. It wasn't bad so we decided to try it another day.

Horrible. Super dry and tiny burritos. Had to return 2 of them because they were just too dry. Especially the RCB (new mexico red chile). The egg and chorizo burrito was mostly tortilla with a little bit of Chorizo and about 1 full egg. It was fairly tasteless.

Probably won't be back. Which is a bummer because we live right by it.

With Senor Taco and Filibertos so close by its gonna be tough to survive with tiny dry burritos for $4.50 each. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Very Fresh, but also Very simple.. ordering online was very good and easy..... The burritos are pretty small, so order 2 or 3 per person.. 

I liked all the ones without beans,,, not a bean fan, and didnt know beans were in so many of them.. my fault not reading the menu fully... 

the 1st time we went the sauce you get int the little tubs was almost comparative to Carolinas, with a good hint of cilantro... 2nd time, was different and a little spicier.. so ehh,,, 3rd time, comin in a couple weeks,, try see if i can balance out and be a regular here..."}
{"text":"we ate there for the first time yesterday.  I thought it was pretty good and the restaurant is clean and nice.  good prices. I actually liked the bean and cheese burro the best."}
{"text":"Quick lunch spot for burritos! Not very much seating but liked the fast service. I ordered a green chile burrito, cheese quesadilla and drink and it was ~$10. It's a cute place, nothing too fancy. Close to Intel so will keep this in our lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Burritos are fire they are small so you gotta order 2 or 3 just to fill up so it's not that cheap but it is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Stopped by to feed my 2yr old and he loved the breakfast barbacoa, I ordered a safety net bean and cheese just in case he didn't like the first and he ended up crushing them both! I loved how fresh the ingredients tasted and will def be back asap!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Rita's picked up a carne asada burrito the flavor of the meat was good but that's all that was in there was meat in a tortilla I told them I they need to make another burrito it's a supreme that has cilantro Pico De Gayo guacamole sour cream and just charge more it would be a much better burrito,"}
{"text":"What a great surprise. Had the Dan...very tasty but the homemade tortilla sent it over the top! Could make a meal out of the side of corn. Wow!! Great place..can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been excited to go and check this place out. I stopped one morning before work for a breakfast burrito. I ordered the egg and Barbacoa burrito, no bacon. I must say the quality of ingredients was excellent!  Several people at work commented on how good my office smelled while I was eating it that morning. 

I returned several days later in the evening to pick up a quick dinner. I got bean and cheese burritos for my fiancé's son, and I bought a carne asada and a Barbacoa to try. My fiancé's son said the bean and cheese was OK he prefers Los Favs. He thought the portion was too small. I preferred the Carne Asada. The steak was seasoned very well!  The Barbacoa was good but it really was just meat and nothing else. The other my other burrito was just meat as well, but I liked it better. 

My fiancé has celiac so he cannot eat any gluten. Unfortunately they only have flour tortilla's. I asked them if they did a corn but they do not. 

Overall I think the quality of ingredients is a four star. I do agree with other posters that the sizes could be a bit bigger. The price is good though, but do not expect a giant burrito. 

I also think that it would be nice to have some other items inside the burrito. I wish they would let us choose which things we could have put in it.  Mix it up a little bit and have some pico or cheese. I also wish they would consider making corn tortillas as well."}
{"text":"This place has the yummiest burritos! The tortillas are fresh and they just melt in your mouth. No greasy after taste and seem healthy also. I wish they sold the tortillas because I would buy them plain. I also wish the hours were better because it seems like they close at six and we usually don't get back from work in time to stop by there to pick something up. Looking forward to trying all of the burritos from there. SOoo delicious and a must try!!! :)"}
{"text":"Family owned local burrito shop! We love this little ocotillo gem! The owners and staff are always friendly and the burritos are amazing! Simple menu and super cheap prices! Breakfast burrito we enjoy the bacon and hash. For lunch or dinner it's barbacoa! The hours are 8-7 weekdays and Saturday it's 8-4 and closed on Sunday! We love that they treat the staff right so it makes it a pleasant experience! The food is all small Bach fresh made if they run out they are done for the day! Small space for tables but Saturday on the patio in cool Arizona mornings is the best!!"}
{"text":"Rita's is awesome!!!!
Low prices, great food, great family business.   Pretty enviornment!!! Just ate a breakfast burrito here.  I never have to make my own again"}
{"text":"Although their meat is really good- I hate having to pay $5 for a small burrito with literally only the meat in it. Just meat and tortilla. If they were to lower the prices, I would defiantly come more, but paying $5 for some meat and a tortilla is too much."}
{"text":"Came in today for the first time ever and had my mind blown. I had the StudioFit wrap, which had amazing flavor. It was so juicy and flavorful, I'm still daydreaming about it. Top that off with the salsas they provide, and it's perfect. Homemade tortillas!  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! They have simple yet AMAZING food!! Fresh and made fast. Not to mention their customer service is amazing!! Must try in Chandler!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here 4-5 times, but I've  found my go to place. Fresh, and absolutely delicious. I don't live nearby, but I do go out of my way, if I'm even close."}
{"text":"We were on the run which meant dinner on the go. Seen Rita's while visiting another establishment. Stopped in and greeted by a sweet young girl. She was quick to ask if we've ever been there before and told us a little about the place and the biggest seller. We decided on 3 different burritos, the Mole, Chile Verde and the Carne Asada. Fresh tortillas was awesome but I wish they added rice and beans rather than just meat filled burritos. We will definitely be back to try their breakfast burritos! Great service and clean shop will have us coming back!"}
{"text":"Had lots of chorizo and egg burritos in my life.  But this is the most disgusting burrito I have ever had.  I would not recommend or return to this filly bees"}
{"text":"I like the concept - low cost, fresh, straight forward foods. I have tried 4 of their burritos. The bean and cheese was SO salty. I had 3 bones in my chicken mole. The chipotle pulled pork was just okay. The only good burrito was the chili verde pork, but it was very good! I would consider coming here again to try a breakfast burrito, or if they cut back on the salt for the bean and cheese for my kids. UPDATED -- tried it again today and it was GREAT! Been and cheese was great, not salty, and tried the carne asada which was amazing. We'll be going back now!!"}
{"text":"Best Burritos on the PLANET!  Amazing portion sizes for the price.  Friendly local owners and staff.  My favorites are Chili Verde and RCB...so good!"}
{"text":"Healthy. Affordable. Locally owned. Friendly. Uber-clean. Professional. Delicious!!! This cute little joint boasts tons of regulars and soda in old school glass bottles. My new fave!!!"}
{"text":"I initially wanted to check out Rita's because I happened to see the low prices and I was intrigued. I went in with fresh eyes and luckily there was no one there so I had time to get a feel for the place. I got a breakfast burrito and it was great! Today, I went there and the line was out the door. Rather than waiting, I decided to call my order in since that what they are best for (per their news interview). I called them numerous times, but there was no answer. I don't think leaving a voicemail would do me justice. So I went to Señor Taco. Sad day."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good reviews, so I thought I would try them.
Like others have said, burritos are rather small.
Menu very limited, and what Mexican place doesn't have rice?
Tried the chili relleno burrito, and the brisket burrito.
They are tasty enough, and inexpensive, but not very satisfying.
I would prefer a much larger tortilla, with beans, rice and the entree filling, and would pay more for it.
Place seems very clean, you can see the prep area from the order counter.
Get a combo plate and some chips and I might return. Give us a reason to return!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Nice people. Just mad it took me a year to realize they were here. Ill never get that year back lol"}
{"text":"I went in today for the chipotle pork burrito, I had read the reviews and didn't believe you had to order up to 3 burritos to be okay? I would say 2 burritos is good per person since they are rather small. The price for each burrito is about 4.25 or so. The flavor however packed a punch! And their red and green salsa was good, go for the green, delicious :)"}
{"text":"Good fresh burrito place!  Really enjoyed the chili verde and bean and cheese!  Tortilla was delicious.  4 stars only because I think the meat filled burritos portion was a little small for the price."}
{"text":"I love Mom and Pop food places and I wanted to like this place but it's not quite there.
The Good:  the tortillas are far better than most average Mexican food places.  they look and taste homemade though slightly on the thin side they are very good and fresh.  Speaking of fresh the food is just that, very fresh!  My first burrito was the carne asada, it had a decent flavor not exactly what I was expecting built it was good.  the meat was juicy and cooked well. 

The not so good;  I tried the chorizo and hash, not good.  the food was still fresh but the chorizo was bland and flat.  Instead of using papitas they opt for hash browns, this leaves the burrito mushy and lacking textural variety.   I read a review that described these burritos as large, they are not.  however if the flavors there it wouldn't be an issue.  I would call this close to authentic but with a gringo touch.  hours are limited, who, closes at 7pm and 2pm on Sat?  I assume this a family thing so while it's not great for a consumer it's nice to see family values as a driving force.

The food is basic which is not a bad thing.  all said compared to what is available around the area it's a good choice."}
{"text":"I got the carne Asada burrito. It was freshly prepared in about 30 seconds. Burritos are kind of small, but the tortillas are soooo good and the meat was amazing. Red sauce was really good."}
