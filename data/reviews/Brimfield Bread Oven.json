{"text":"This place has such fantastic breads, it was worth the money considering the ingredients, artistry and time it takes to turn out such quality. I bought the best pepperoni rolls I have ever eaten,  an incredible soft pretzel, and a delicious cranberry-walnut bread. I also couldn't resist a day-old french batard and a seeded sourdough. All surpassed my expectations. My dog got a hold of the remaining sourdough when I was out of the house, and I have no doubt it was the best contraband treat of her life... lol"}
{"text":"Bread and pastries are good.  Finally able to have their pizza last week.  Toppings are tasty but dough on sides and bottom burned.  I was watching them make the ones before mine, burned, then mine, burned.  Maybe their pizza dough recipe needs to be revisited- too much sugar?  It is not because of the wood fired oven.  I have had pizza from many wood fired ovens and none were as burned as these.  Do stop in for the bread, cheese sticks are tasty ."}
{"text":"I am looking forward to returning here for pizza. I had a handmade pizza roll as well as a handmade pretzel. Both were amazing. The folks here are so nice and friendly. Cannot wait to try more of their breads. 

Also, their cinnamon rolls are sold on Saturday and Sunday I was told as I was looking (read: craving) cinnamon at the time I stopped in."}
{"text":"I have not had the pizza, but I can attest that their baguettes and pastries are ridiculously good. You can definitely tell that these people love baking and making real bread with real flavor and passion. 

If you want bread or baked goods that taste great, then go here, and if you don't then you are wasting your time on Yelp."}
{"text":"I travel a good 50 minutes to enjoy the freshest goodies from the Brimfield Bread Oven. This is a small, fresh bakery, and from the outside it doesn't look like anything special or elaborate, but walking through the doors you think your in heaven. The margarita pizza is baked to perfection. Not to mention the Kalamata Olive Bread and the Cinnamon Bread Sticks are tasty treats as well."}
{"text":"Update: Went for the pizza last night and it was the best pizza ever! Charred just right, the sauce had tons of flavor and the perfect amount of cheese. The staff as always was friendly and they have now started a rewards program. We grabbed some cookies on the way out and the threw in a danish for free.  The almond cookie was to die for....literately they only had one left and my hubby and I fought for it. Crunchy outside but gooey inside. Love Brimfield Bread Oven."}
{"text":"We get bread from here almost every weekend. Love the cranberry walnut one. The trick to it is you have to call earlier in the week and place your order and then go pick it up day of. Staff is very informative and seems passionate about it. Good pastries, too, and love that they always have samples out."}
{"text":"Simply incredible.   It was a 14-degree morning when I pulled up.  I couldn't see inside since the windows were steamed over.  Walking in I was overwhelmed by the lovely smell of fresh bread and a faint whiff of a fire.       Staff was extremely friendly and helpful and explained the selections to me.  I got the cinnamon twists and basically one of each of the pastry selections.   The texture and taste were divine;  buttery, slightly crunchy, a perfect crumb.  Amazing.  I only regret I was just passing through and couldn't stay for the breads coming out later.   The people of Kent are so lucky.   I found myself angry at seeing people in line for drive through McDonalds across the street when a trip here would be probably less money but worlds better in taste.   I wanted to tell the to jump the curb and go directly to BBO.   If you're within 50 miles, take the detour.   It's worth the trip"}
{"text":"We buy our bread from here every single week. It's always fresh and high quality. Their bread selection is consistent so you can always get your favorites. The desserts are to die for and we love picking up the pizzas over the weekend. We've never been disappointed by any of their products and rave about them to all of our friends and family."}
{"text":"Great brick oven pizza! I called half hour before closing and they were still pleasant and happy to make my pizza! Fresh, homemade ingredients is what I love!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and quick and friendly staff. Well worth a visit no matter if you want to dine in or take out."}
{"text":"Wow!!  Delicious!    You can't go wrong with anything.  We will be back.  I added goat chees to my sausage and mushroom pizza.  Simply the best.  My lovely wife enjoye tthe Margarita pizza.  The sauce wat perfect and basal fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious bread - when we arrived at noon on a Saturday there weren't  many choices left but the multigrain wheat was amazing. I'll be back to try other varieties."}
{"text":"I haven't physically been to the Brimfield Bread Oven but I purchased their hamburger buns yesterday from the Mustard Seed in Solon and they were hands down the best bread/buns I have ever had! Perfect 4 pack to make dinner for two. They were insanely fresh and had great flavor. I would eat these by themselves with butter........actually I don't even think I would butter them they tasted so good. The bread just melts in your mouth! I will definitely be making a trip here soon!"}
{"text":"If your looking for well crafted loafs of bread you didn't even know existed this is the place! We don't eat bread on the regular but any time we have guests or if we are going to an event including food we don't even think twice, we have to have something from here to impress. The walnut cranberry and the mushroom bread have been my favorites so far, we need to try their pizza soon! Only thing I found a little odd is if you go there before 10-11am your buying day old because the fresh batches aren't done. My husband is a MORNING person and likes to check off his errands early so we always end up with the day olds."}
{"text":"Fantastic! The pizza here is incredible, best in NE ohio. Crisp, delicate crust, slight char - perfect! Toppings were tasty and unique. Mild sausage, thin sliced pepperoni. Fresh mozzarella, and very flavorful sauce. Amazing pizza experience. Excellent wines too. This is my new favorite pizza!"}
{"text":"What a gem! The smell of fresh bread when you walk in is unbelievable. And the large wood fired oven is a nice sight. We arrived late morning and they were busy, didnt realize we would have to fight for the last blueberry pastry! Lol. They have a ton of great fresh breads, pretzels, pastries, croissants and pizza's every Friday and Saturday night. The staff is super friendly, make sure to get their early because they sell out quick. 

We ordered an assortment of goodies, cinnamon twists, pepperoni rolls, pretzels, cheddar cheese bread sticks, apple, blueberry and almond danish. My favorite had to be the pretzel croissant. Just the simple touch of salt on it completely changed everything. I don't think I can eat a regular croissant again. Everything was exceptional. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"Pizza is the best around. Bread is super fresh and crusty. I feel like I should pay them money for the fresh baked bread smells you get walking in."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! We got a baguette, county sourdough, and sea salt focaccia. Everything was very good, and their passion really shows in their food. The focaccia was definitely our favorite!

We got there around noon on Saturday and they were already sold out of a lot of things. We can't wait to go back and try some of the other things. We also didn't realize they only do pizza starting at 5:30 pm, so we will have to go back for that too!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal for excellent bread and pastry.  Wood fired just tastes better.  Pizza is very good too- perfect crispy but chewy crust."}
{"text":"Great selection of homemade breads. I always stop by and grab a few bags before a get together. This bread is always the first side gone. The selection is amazing. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Can get a little busy but to me that just goes to show how good it is! Best to go first thing in the morning. Very happy they are local for us but well worth the drive if needed."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night, for my first visit to Brimfield Bread Oven, I ordered for pickup a Margarita pizza.  The pizza was well balanced among crust, sauce, cheese, olive oil, and basil: nothing was too intense, dull, loaded or not enough--everything was just right.  The generous portion of mozzarella cheese is what I first struck me and made me sing.  The red sauce was tangy and sweet.  The crust was soft and dry, maybe a little too chewy, and consistent from the edge of the pie to its center. The pizza wasn't  soggy (hot, soupy, molten) at the center, as are some Neapolitan pizza.  A nice light char colored the crusts edge and added good flavor and texture.  I will definitely be back for pizza.
      The rewards program says to me that they appreciate and want to reward their customers loyalty."}
{"text":"Everything is made to perfection. My favorites are the plain (butter) croissants, pretzel bread, lavender shortcake, and cinnamon sticks. I look forward to continuing to try other items on my future visits."}
{"text":"The margarita pizza was amazing! I called it in and it took only 15 min to make my pizza. I truly enjoyed it and will be returning when I'm in the area :)"}
{"text":"Great local spot each item is $2.50 - $3.00 and very good. My only complaint is my savoury pastries werent warmed up. Aside from that great!"}
{"text":"An absolutely lovely shop with delicious homemade breads and pastries! 
After participating in their kick-starter in which I received a generous number of loaves as a reward I made the mistake of not actually coming into the store for months after they opened. Well I got there a couple months ago and the olive and herb foccacia, sour dough batard (I spelled that correctly), scones, and croissants are out-of-this-world faves! 
You just can't beat homemade and these will put love in your heart!"}
{"text":"I have not sampled the bread offerings because I came for dinner, pizza. I can say the breads looked great though! Everything is baked on premises. Nice selection and pizza after 5:50pm certain days. Very friendly owners and staff. Delicious pizza, not overly bready and delicious tomato sauce. Not a typical pizza place for sure. Just a few types made with the same dough from their baguettes. Go, check them out I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Clean, cute, and friendly! Our pizza was perfect in every way!!! We found this place as we were passing through the area and If we are ever in the area again you can bet we will stop for a second time!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast croissants and pastries anywhere. Coffee is locally roasted. Staff are great, everything is amazingly good!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh breads and a few pastries. A small dining area to enjoy coffee or wine with their oven-baked pizza. An old fashioned stereo with a selection of record albums and a bookcase of eclectic titles to peruse. Friendly staff. We love this local business and patronize often!"}
{"text":"Yas!!!!!! We loved them at the farmers market, love them even more now. Do you stomach a favor and visit this little spot in Brimfield! It's life changing. Seriously, the best bread I have ever had. Omg, just wow."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this establishment! My relationship with fresh baked bread is a passionate romance  but really i love bread so much i learned how to make it from scratch in many different ways. After all that I found BBO and it really saves me time buying their superior bread and pastries. The almond danish makes me so happy."}
{"text":"Wood fired perfection. Croissants of the likes dreams are made from. Your best day ever begins with something delectable from Brimfield Bread Oven."}
{"text":"Found this while driving home a random way. I looked at their menu online & HAD to try it! Hubby got the pepperoni roll, i had a lemon blueberry scone, and we got rolls for dinner. AMAZINGLY GOOD!! even 2 days later the pepperoni rolls were fresh and good! Id highly recommend trying this local business if your in the area!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I feel like I am in Paris...that's how amazing it is!!! Everything is so good but the top recommendations would be...

The cheddar sticks...they are addicting so be careful! Your cannot just have one...or two...or four...hahaha

The pizza is phenomenal! Just like I had in Italy...by far the best pizza I have had in the United States.

Croissants make me feel like I'm sitting at a cafe in France...so flaky...so warm...so yummy!!!

If you haven't gone to Brimfield bread oven...you haven't lived! Go today!"}
{"text":"Their bread is beyond amazing.  After eating from their bakery, one never wishes to eat disgusting grocery store bread ever again.  I can't even recommend one thing to get, as every item there is amazing.  Fresh breads, their cheddar bread, pretzels, pastries.  Amazing."}
{"text":"Best croissants this side of the atlantic, just kidding, best ones around the kent area.

Too bad you have to cross i76 to get them but worth the drive to Brimfield"}
{"text":"Talk about a true art form, the variety of knots, twist & time that goes into their breads is absolutely beautiful. And their pastries are uniquely flavored; such as the kale & goat cheese danish (my fav)! 
 They didn't have any in their display case last night but I spotted them on a tray that was going to be thrown out. The cashier was kind enough to give me 2 for free. But when she saw I was sharing them, she gave me an additional 2 @ no cost! But even if she hadn't, my family & I have always enjoyed their customer service, clean & cute atmosphere & the pizzas!
 This is a great place to go if you're sick & tired of the every day chain pizza shops & seek variety & a healthy snack. The pizzas are made from scratch with fresh ingredients. Even if this place is a little out of your way, it is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Finally the stars aligned for me to get to Brimfield Bread Oven's storefront for their special oven-fired pizza (only served Wednesday-Saturday, 5:30-9pm).  The nondescript stretch of Rt. 43 gives no hint of the delights that are to be found within BBO's premises, so go and trust.

The pizzas are made with fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, high quality mushrooms, etc.  They do not skimp on the caliber of their ingredients.  The pizzas come out in a flash, and the wood fire oven adds a chewiness and slight smokiness to the crust that you just can't get through a regular oven bake.  They have several set combinations of toppings, or you can create your own.  If you can't eat in, they also sell takeaway pizzas, and pre-made pies to prepare at home.

By night, at least on a Thursday, the vibe was calm and casual, with families and couples coming in for a bite.  The adjacent dining area can get a bit cacophonous if there's a crowd, but by day it would be a nice place to study or read with a coffee and one of their unusually delicious baked goods.

To complement the pizza, they offer wine by the glass or bottle, San Pellegrino products, juices, etc.  You may also be lucky enough to score one of their home-baked cookies for dessert (chocolate cherry and gluten-free almond lemon varieties were still on hand last night).

I'm not sure if it's an ongoing promotion or a one time deal, but if you register as a return customer with them (via your phone number), when you spend $50 they will give you $5 towards future purchases. That's half a pizza right there! 

The staff are friendly and very passionate and knowledgeable about the wares that they sell.  This place sets the bar extremely high for both its pizza and bread offerings, and I can't recommend them enough."}
