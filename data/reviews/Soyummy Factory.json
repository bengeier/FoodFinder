{"text":"This place is a gem! Street style Korean food/snacks. A family run restaurant, cash only. Quite small in an obscure location, but I get something from this place every time I'm in the area because everything is so reasonably priced and goddamn delicious!"}
{"text":"You know, if I wasn't a regular at Try Again bubble tea house, I wouldn't have ran into this place. As you head down the steps to go to Try Again, look to the right and you'll find So Yummy Factory!

They have korean food you can pick up quickly and they have a bakery side where you can snack on their red bean cakes - yummmm I love anything red bean and red bean cakes j'adore!

I felt a little shy taking photos and actually asked before I did haha - weird right?! but nah, I think it was just because they were new. Actually just the end of May if I remember correctly from what the owner told me.

I picked up 20 pieces of their walnut red bean cakes that are actually shaped as walnuts - CLEVER! haha - they took me 2 days to finish. It only cost me $8.95 and they taste much better than timbits ;) how could anyone even compare!

The owners seemed friendly and I'll definitely come back for more of their red bean cakes and try out their korean dishes

Their open everyday except Sunday and close at 6pm."}
{"text":"Small place but amazing food and decent price! if you crave kimbap or 'fish cake' (has red bean) you will love this place! for 9.99 you can get a awesome meal! super cute ma and pa shop."}
{"text":"Since I live pretty far north, I rarely make trips further than  downtown. So if I am coming up from downtown or the deep south, I will forfeit Deerfoot Trail to make a detour to Chinatown for SooYummy. The shop is located in the same building as the HSBC bank and is also home to Try Again, Diamond Bakery, a Chinese medicine shop, butcher shop, and a hair salon. SooYummy has a small menu featuring Korean snacks like kimbap, hodo gwaja (red bean and walnut filled cake balls?), fish shaped cakes with red bean paste, rice cakes, soondae, etc. I usually get the original kimbap and 20 piece of hodo gwaja (10 for me during the commute back home and 10 for my family to fight over lol). Everything is reasonably priced and it is the place I go to for my Korean food fix (since I'm a vegetarian and most places are BBQ or has seafood in the dishes). Like most Chinatown establishments, cash is king, so bring enough, enough for a couple bowl cakes and egg tarts at Diamond Bakery next door, too ;)"}
{"text":"Hugely mediocre Korean food that is likely about 2.5 stars, but just didn't lift me into wanting to rate it higher...
Each dish was ok, but the appetizers were pretty well standard. When I leave a resto kinda glad to leave, it's all about finding nothing to inspire or return to. If flavours are slack and tailored to the Canadian palate, then of course both being both a foodie and knowing good Korean food helps inform one of the differences...
If anyone wants good Korean (!), cross the street to Bon-ga, where their entree dishes for the most part are singularly good, but leave this NOT 'sso yummy' alone unless you like milder accents in poor Korean food."}
{"text":"Rice cakes are amazing. its chewy and a bit spicy and the flavour is perfect. i have tried many places before and usually the rice cakes are way to soft.  Gimbap/Kimbap is very good. they also give a small bowl a soup which is very nice. If you like red bean then you should try the  red bean filled fish cakes."}
{"text":"I've never had taiyaki. It's my lady's favourite Japanese treat, and turns out that Koreans have the same thing. 

This little shop is situated in a small mall setting in China town. Only place we know of that sells this treat. Red bean filling? Yup. 5 for $5 is a good deal. Made fresh to order, they were flaky and tasty. The red bean doesn't taste like bean, but is actually sweet and delicious. It's worth the trip and a great addition to anyone's belly."}
{"text":"Love this place! Authentic tasting kimbap and teokbokki, great for a quick lunch. Takes me back to the small street style stalls that Korea is flooded with."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop shop located downstairs of HSBC. They serve Korean snack / street / finger food.

Some things that they have:

 Doeok bokki - a rice stick thing, 

Mandoos - dumplings.
Kim bap - cooked sushi roll korean style

Waffle cake balls filled w red bean and walnuts
Fish shaped glutinous pastry filled with cream or red bean.

The couple who own the shop are really nice and are now opened on sundays! 

Located beside 'diamond bakery' and 'Try again'"}
{"text":"Review: lunch.

Bottomline: small hole in the wall Korean restaurant with big tastes at a price that's pretty much unbeatable anywhere else.

Atmosphere: pretty much nonexistent. Restaurant is put together with random home furniture and lighting. Restroom is extremely small and filled with boxes. You get your own drinks from a cooler. Waitress was very friendly though. Word of advice, don't bring your first date here.

Food: we ordered the kimbap combo, the pork bulgogi with rice, and the rice cake noodle. Everything was phenomenal and truly reflects the restaurant's name. The kimbap had a perfect balance of rice to fillings ratio and wrapped very nicely.  The bulgogi was flavorful. The noodles was cooked well and spiced to my liking. Even the miso soup had hotpot style fish balls to create more texture. Best of all, they were all quite authentic.

Value: simply amazing considering the food they dish out. This is the place to have cheap but awesome Korean food. Portions were very generous as well.

Encore? Definitely when I'm craving some bulgogi or kimbap."}
