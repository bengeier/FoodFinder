{"text":"Tears in my eyes cause no one has wrote a review. Truth be known, What a Burger isn't a fine dining joint. It is however one of the oldest car hop burger places around with the old walkie talkie order boxes. Having eaten at this iconic eatery for the last 50 years all I can say is, \"I'll have a what-a-cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, onion and make sure it's got mayonaise on it and large cherry lemon Sundrop to go.\""}
{"text":"This place is an awesome preservation of history and a classic. Drive in or dine in goodness for the win.  This is far different than the normal looking, new Whataburger I am used to seeing off the interstate.  The people here are as Southern and friendly as you can imagine.  The food was great and hot; it had to have been one of the most popular lunch spots in town.  I am very glad I went out of the way to eat here with family."}
{"text":"Well, my first visit ever.  I ordered a cheeseburger and didn't get cheese n my burger.  But the food tasted ok, fries were ahh"}
{"text":"Love this place! Every single time we come our food is perfected and delicious. The taste is great. The wait time is not very long at all. I love their chicken fries! Would always recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"For the 3rd time in a row, I've gotten the wrong order after years of service. I called to complain but the volume on their end was so low, I could barely hear them. Service there is going down hill...sad"}
{"text":"What a nice way to eat lunch.  Drive up, push a button, order, and presto! lunch is served curbside.  I know I can do this at Sonic, too, but this location actually opened in 1964, so I love the authentic nostalgia.  There's a couple low-star reviews for getting an order wrong, but my experience was spot on.  I agree with Fred B's wonderful review when he states, \"the thing about What-A-Burger has always been about the size of the burger - it is big, a 6 ounce patty on a large bun, and it is an excellent diner style burger, full of flavor.\"  Ditto that, Fred!  Looking for a slightly different and nostalgic way to dine?  I say drive in to What A Burger #10 and \"Give 'em a whirl.\"  Feeling brave?  Order a witch doctor!"}
{"text":"Been eating at what a burger since I was a kid. I always enjoy the cheeseburgers, and even a bbq plate at times. The sweet tea is always on point too. I eat here a few times a month and really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Always solid . It's my local what a burger . Always call in an order to go . Always ready in 10 min and the food is always solid . Took away a star because they are not exactly nice on the phone and the woman who took my order hung up on me ( I get they were busy but come on ) as soon as she got my order even though I was asking a question"}
{"text":"The only place Ive ever seen that tried to charge for \"packs of ketchup\"!! Yes, they tried to charge me for packs of ketchup! The girl said they can give you 4 packs of ketchup then charge for more.  I couldnt believe my ears.  How is 4 packs of ketchup enough for  3 peoples food?  They said it was the managers policy so I asked to see the manager so I could tell them how cheap they were.  Thats when another lady turned around and put two heaping handfuls of ketchup in our bag as if she could not believe the other girl was giving us such crap.  I will NEVER go back to what a burger because of this experience.  You can even go to Wendys, McDonalds, etc.. or any rest. out there and get as much ketchup as you want with no problem.  I have never seen a place do that or be that stingy! The food...........another story, nothing to brag about.  Greasy soggy fries and dry burgers......stick to the big chains, you'll be much more satisfied."}
{"text":"I love the what-a-burgers, onion rings, & cherry lemon sundrop. Fantastic combination. Same food as when I was a child and still great. I love going back there. Great prices too."}
{"text":"Back to the future is 30 years old now, back to the past has been around since the 50's in the Kannapolis area at the What-A-Burger Drive-Ins, several of which still exist around this part of the state.   There have been several chains that have had a version of the name What-A-Burger - one around the Virginia Beach area, another one in Texas in the same time frame, the 50's (and by far the largest, throughout the SE), and this one in the Concord/Kannapolis area, started by the Bost family, with the first one opening in 1956.  C. W. Bost was selling hamburgers at a local diner in Concord in 1955, and supposedly visited a McDonald's out west and was inspired to try the concept on a local level. The next year he opened the first What-A-Burger in Concord, and business took off. There may have been as many as 15 locations (not all at the same time) in a 4 or 5 county area, and may be one or two slipped across the state line in to SC, opinion vary on this. This location was opened in December, 1964.  At one point, the restaurants were assigned a number (this one is #10, and still says so on the sign, as does #11 in Mooresville), and not necessarily in the order they were opened. There are 6 or 7 left now of that original chain, most in Cabarrus County, and the one in Mooresville. There is a restaurant in Whitesville that uses the name, and is \"famous\" for its breaded French Fries, but is not connected to this chain. And there is a  little hamburger joint in Greensboro, Church Street Drive-Inn, that has been serving a What-A-Burger since 1959, and in the same spot since 1965, but has no connection to the chain.  This place still offers full drive-in service, and the food is excellent - true drive-in style burgers, hot dogs, onion rings, fries, and even a solid Pork BBQ Sandwich. The thing about What-A-Burger has always been about the size of the burger - it is big, a 6 ounce patty on a large bun, and it is an excellent diner style burger, full of flavor.   The Hot Dog is equally good, loaded with tasty chili, a decent wiener, and a soft bun. This is an excellent place to get your dog all-the-way because their slaw is great, very creamy. The BBQ Sandwich really surprised me, I did not remember it as being all that good, but this is not bad pig, at all.   They are known for 2 drinks here - Cherry Lemon Sun Drop and their Witch Doctor Drink - a mixture of various soft drinks to which several dill pickle slices are added - this is an acquired taste, obviously, The pricing has always been reasonable - the Cheeseburger, BBQ Sandwich, Hot Dog, and 2 large drinks were just over $12.  This is truly a blast from the past place, with the added bonus of serving great drive-in food at a very nice price. It is worth the trip."}
{"text":"The Whattaburger with cheese and bacon is the best thing since sliced bread! Their witch doctor with EXTRA pickles is what you should order to drink (Just do it! You won't regret it!!) kind of pricey despite the single dollar sign and the look of the restaurant. The restaurant needs updating, but most people don't order it for there anyway. All in all, great place for lunch & dinner!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It is definitely a local joint. Don't be scared off by first looks. It looks sketchy for sure. But, great burgers, fries, and best Cherry Lemon Sundrop around!"}
