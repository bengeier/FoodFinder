{"text":"Came for a visit on Father's Day. Only set menus were available, with four options. That was fair enough as it would be busy and a small selection would enable quicker preparation of the food. We arrived fairly early at 5:30 to beat the busy crowd. We ordered the first set option with a side of mushrooms and tofu to accommodate for the vegetarian in our family. The food came out slow, half an hour in, most of the dishes except the tofu came out.  We asked a waitress about the status of the missing dish, only for her to look at us blankly and walk away without any word.  With great patience, we waited longer. Everyone but the vegetarian was nearly done with their meal and we asked another waitress, to find out they missed to record the dish.  Again, we waited. Everyone was done with their dinner and we had been sitting there for about an hour and half. Decided to leave as the dish was most likely not prepared yet. As we went to pay the bill and told, who seemed to be the owner, to take the dish we never got off the bill. However, she responded with a poor attitude and the tofu dish happened to arrive at the same time.  She rudely told the waitress to bring the tofu away, and notified that it would be taken off our bill. We never got a receipt of the prices of our meal, and seemingly was charged more. Most likely still charged for the plate we waited an hour and half for and never got in the end.  The price is definitely not what concerns me, not even being overcharged. It is the attitude and service of the workers and the owner.  Food was mediocre and small servings, can find much better in the area."}
{"text":"Came here to try their dim sum and was very impressed. On weekdays, they have a special before 11am.   Food: Dim sum items were unique and quality was good. Not only it tasted good, but it was good value. For example, most places have a doggy seafood pancake. The pancake here was crispy which is good. The rice pot dish was good for a decent price. Lots of variety too.   Atmosphere: Service is good, they check up on you often and clear the dishes often. They also have lots of tea selection, including chrysanthemum which is not offered by the typical places. Also, the decor of the restaurant was comfortable."}
{"text":"This restaurant is nicely decorated. It looks similar to the other lobsters harbour restaurants."}
{"text":"My first question was whether this restaurant was connected to the similarly named Fishman Wharf Seafood restaurant just a few blocks away on the same street or to the even more nearby Fishman Lobster Clubhouse restaurant.  That question will go unanswered for now.  The restaurant had recently added dim sum hours after opening around 2 years ago.  This review is for the dim sum offering.  My assessment is that this is a very reasonable place for food and prices.  They also have a few unique items that I've never seen before at dim sum such as avocado rolls with eel and an ox-tails item.  Service is passable. Place has a clean appearance."}
{"text":"This is the second time here. The seafood just isn't good. Place is cold inside private room. The dish re not clean. The service isn't good. We order and lot of dish were not available. This will be my last time here."}
{"text":"Came here because fisherman lobster clubhouse was full on a Saturday night.   Seafood tasted fresh and there were many options to choose from. Sadly it's better to come here in a large group because most of their dinner sets are catered for 6 or more.   Prices here are not very expensive for what it is. I would most likely come back with a bigger group to try out some of their items"}
{"text":"I know presentation and decor is important for a restaurant. It's gotta look appealing to entice you to eat it, right? Fishman Village nails it for this category. But everything else falls apart after you admire how the dishes are decorated.  Huge dishes used to plate the food. If you're ordering a lot or are seated at a small table, it gets pretty crowded. The waitress almost spilled an entire dish and tea all over our table because of this.  Portions are small. Ordered stir-fried clams in black bean sauce and it only came with about 15 clams (a third of them came empty...). Nothing is outstandingly good unless you're willing to order expensive seafood. Service is prioritized to those in the private rooms. Wait staff are trying their best.   Most likely my first and last visit. Would not recommend for dinner."}
{"text":"I've come for dim sum and I've also come for dinner. I think I've been here like four or five times in the last two weeks. The food quality here is surprisingly good. The black vinegar for their vegetarian goose isn't just chinkiang vinegar. It's fruity. The sesame sauce for their cruller wrapped in rice paper roll isn't watered down. The taro puffs filled with minced pork are fried beautifully so the crispy taro exterior is, for lack of better descriptors, light and fluffy in a fried kinda way.   Dim sum highlights include braised oxtail ($5.50), some fried radish pastry filled with radish slivers and minced pork, beef tendon that is tender but still has a bit of chew to it, and the most ideally shaped, perfectly plump steamed dumplings I've ever seen. If you check my Instagram, I've got a picture there somewhere. They're beautiful, and the wrappers aren't old and chewy. Chiu chow steamed dumplings are where it's at, or so I've been told. Oh. Going back to the beef tendon, Grandpa actually doesn't like tendon because he finds it mushy, but I made him try a piece and then he had three because he liked them so much.To be honest, I have yet to have a dim sum dish here that isn't slightly above average in some way. So I guess um...eat it all!  A funny thing from dinner is that whether you order a set for two or a set for 10, if it comes with your meal, they'll give you a big tureen of Chinese soup. The first time we came for dinner, we had four people. We brought home three large takeout containers of soup. Another funny (sad) thing is that their sweet and sour pork in whole pineapple was actually served on a long plate where the pork was on one side, and an empty, carved out pineapple sat on the other side of the plate as garnish. Oh. The sweet and sour pork was mediocre. One of the few mediocre things I've had here.  The fried lobster mountain here doesn't contain quite so many little fried fish or quite as much fried garlic as Fishman Lobster Clubhouse. Their lobster tomalley fried rice also doesn't have as much tomalley in it. However, I think I prefer it here. Their steamed crab is cut open for you so you don't have to get your hands quite as dirty eating it. That's a huge plus in my books. The steamed fish is actually cut into pieces for you so if eating a whole fish seems intimidating to you, this is a nice intro for you. The oysters are cooked to perfection. They're plump and juicy and they're very large oysters. The eel was very nicely done as well. The dried orange peel and black bean sauce was delicious.   I think this is my new favorite dim sum place and also fancy Chinese seafood place. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This seafood restuarant has been around forever and recently they started their dim sum menu. Dim sum special is till 11 am, s/m/l dim sums is $3.00. Tea price is $1/ person. Im not sure if they have this special on the weekends.   I came here at 9 am on a Thursday morning and it wasnt busy at all. There are limited tables because the space is so much smaller compared to other dim sum places. But staff were friendly and dishes were clean. Im guessing no one knows about the dim sum special becuase it is not stated anywhere on the menu. However I found out through their staff.  There are some interesting dim sum dishes on the menu. I got the fried cruller with rice noodle (cheung fun) covered in cashew pieces. The cheung fun is quite soft but the cruller was over-fried. The steamed walnut bun was really interesting. They actually had alot of walnut pieces inside the bun with a sweet filling. Im not a big fan of walnut but it was still interesting to try since it isnt offered anywhere else. The steamed chiu chow fun gor had alot of crunchy veggie filling and not too much meat which I like. However the skin is a little too thick for my liking but skin is still soft. The last thing I got was the steamed duck feet with taro. It was wrapped in bean curd with a huge taro, chinese mushroom, and some sort of meat. This dish was a little blend compared to other dishes but I thought it was still pretty yummy. Their hot chilli oil isnt spicy though :(.   Everything came out fresh and hot. There are other interesting dim sum dishes I want to try so I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"SLOWEST SERVICE EVER.   I came here for dinner on a weekday night. They weren't that busy but I think that they were understaffed because it took ~45 minutes for our first dish to arrive. The food here wasn't even good enough to be worth the wait. I found everything to be too salty. The taste actually wasn't too bad but the saltiness really ruined the meal. I won't be returning."}

{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.When my family and I came into the restaurants the waitress and waiters did not seem to even take notice to our arrive and only responded to us when we waved at them. When they took the seafood out of the tank they would splash everyone with water and leave a puddle right by the entrance. Along with a waitress that kept on screaming very loudly throughout the restaurant.   The complimentary soup tasted like organs. The beef fried noodles we got was burnt the first time and when we asked them to remake it the noodles came out all broken up. The owner gave us a sour face when we asked them to remake it. We also ordered the combo with eel, snow pea, chicken and lobster. The lobster was way too salty and was not edible.   I wouldn't recommend this place and we did not have a good experience with the food being over priced."}
{"text":"Make reservations or be prepared to wait! This restaurant was full on a Tuesday night, and the wait was about 10-15 minutes. They have a tank of live lobster and BC crab, which is a popular menu item. I would say their menu was satisfying and the food is not very salty, which I like.   We ordered the set course as we were 5: - Shark fin soup: Big piece of shark fin but the soup had a strong taste of MSG with every spoonful  - Deep fried oysters: Large pieces of oyster with a similar sweet and sour sauce but it was not very crispy - Lamb with curry: Quite dry but spices are good  - Lobster: THE HIGHLIGHT! The lobster reminds me of Yu Seafood's style of lobster. It was very fresh and cooked perfectly, which is hard for such a big lobster of 5 pounds.  - Steamed bass: Dry but still good with the soy sauce  - Snow pea tip: The veggies are a bit too chewy - Fried rice with lobster tomalley: Rice is a bit dry for my liking but the flavour is good.   The restaurant itself looks renovated and they have rooms for larger parties. No sign of lots of drinking here on a Tuesday at 8pm, and the service is okay."}
{"text":"Our friend recommend to come here for dim sum.  At first I was skeptical about this restaurant because the name is related more to seafood than dim sum.  However I can tell you the dim sum are pretty good.  They offer variety of food.  The full size traditional Chinese sausage hot pot rice only cost $5 which surprised me.  Many restaurant would charge at least 7 to 8 dollar.  We also had the scallop rice cake with xo sauce.  That was really good and not many restaurant carry it.  The restaurant is kind of small and  not a lot of seats compare to others.  Best to reserve the seats ahead of time when going.  We will for sure go there again in the future."}
{"text":"This is a seafood place, but we made the mistake of ordering off the veggie menu and basically spend the rest of the day feeling gross.   The veggie plate that we ordered was bitter melon deep fried with yolk coating. It was very heavy.   The lobster and steam fish definitely has potential, but I couldn't speak much about other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Went here with my entire family of 17, ordered the 10 person meal and a few add ons, by far one of our worst restaurant experiences ever  The service was terrible, the staff does not understand english very well and gets frustrated with you and rolls their eyes when you ask them if you could get some water for the kids the third time since it never came the first two times  Lobster - was fried in a mountain similar to fishman clubhouse, but much much more oily and also very sweet for some reason  Crab - when we go to fishman's clubhouse and we get the alaskan crab, it usually ends up being 3 different dishes due to the size of it, here we only got two dishes that were smaller than what we usually get, i suspect we didn't get the whole crab here  Geoduck - was served raw and did not taste fresh, it had the old fishy taste to it  Fish - is not the usual fresh sea bass you get at chinese restaurants, its a smaller, bonier flat fish that was also pretty fishy as well  There was no dessert...  All other dishes were either too salty or heavily oiled. I have never been more disappointed from both the food and service of a supposedly higher end restaurant.  The best dish? The seafood fried rice, 12.99$ of the $1000 meal"}
{"text":"Finally came to try this restaurant, first off, the restaurant looks pretty nice and modern inside,  we had a reservation for a table of 10, we were seated promptly, as soon as we sat down, I noticed something was off, there were 7 napkins with  10 pairs of chopsticks, I called the waiter over, he apologized for it, then I noticed that there were only 9 bowls instead of 10, the waiter brought over the menu, the first thing I saw was the lunch menu, which is kind of odd, being it is 6pm. Nobody came over to see if we are ready to order,we had to flag down this wattress, asked for recommendations and none was given, we just chose one of the set dinner, the food in general was pretty good, prices were reasonable, they started serving dessert before we finished our main course, which is a no no in my book, the wait staff needs proper training, this place has potential, it is definitely work in progress."}
{"text":"Service here doesn't exist. They provide one teapot of tea for a table of ten and they don't bother to refill it unless requested. The waitresses stand around chatting instead of attending to tables. You get this small console thing where you press buttons to request for service and even with that, they're slow to service.  We reserved a peking duck for dinner and it took ages for it to come out. When it did come out, it didn't come out with the crepes and we had to wait another 10 minutes for the crepes. A single sauce plate and a measly plate of roughly a dozen cucumber sticks and green onion were provided.  The menu lacks vegetables but the food is your typical Chinese food. You get a plate of peanuts at the start and a soup at the end - it wasn't red bean soup and I don't know what it's called but it wasn't very good."}
{"text":"First impression of Fishman Village ???? was that I was not impressed as I walked into the restaurant has a full house of half drunk patrons. Almost every single tables emptying beers by the dozen or red wine by the bottles.  Second Impression was this place just too noisy and giving me a headache.  I ended up have to wait 15 minutes or so for a table for 2 as there are only 5 of those and the rest are all large tables for 10.  Should I be ordering seafood as I looked around and saw lobsters, fish and clams...  Wait staff was really helpful in recommending what's good in the menu without being pushy.  Stir Fried Duck ($18) ???  and XO Sauce Seafood Vegetable ($12) XO?????? were both really good. I really enjoyed the duck as it has an intense salty soy sauce taste and would have taste so good with iced cold beer... A lot of bones and needs work to dig out all the meat and included even the head and neck and more.  Service was good as 2 of the wait staff came by and asked how we like the duck and even replaced our side dish which piled up with duck bones with clean one.  My dinner mate still talking about the duck dish hours after our meal. I guess we will be back again soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves the best Chinese food. If you want authentic and flavorful Chinese food, this is the best place. Not only is their food delicious, the food presentation is out of this world!! I came here during dinner time and it was very packed. You have to get their lobster dishes! So fresh and tasty!! Imagine lobsters stacked on top of each other forming a mountain!!  The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. The service is also attentive and quick. Highly recommend this place for family dinners and celebrations. Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"This is a not so new restaurant all of sudden breaths new life. Recently noticed the parking lot has been full all the time, unlike before, always half empty. Went to try out today and was pleasantly surprised. The dishes were really tasty and with very fresh ingredients. ????The dining room interior is the new traditional Asian style. The steamed fish was a rare find of Blue cod????) . The fish meat is tender and sweet, delicious! The Pea Shute is solidly above average. The sauce of the stir fry clams(????)is outstanding. Mushrooms with Sweet Clam (???????)is fresh with bouncy bite to it. A real treat!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 1 star not because of the food. The food was actually decent. However, the service we received was absolutely horrendous.  I went there on Chinese new year with a group of 9 people and ordered the crab and lobster set dinner. The food was tasty and the portions were big. The set was meant for 8 people but even with 9 people we had to stuff ourselves to finish all the food.  It was a good experience until it was time for dessert. The set comes with fried glutinous rice balls which most of us were eager to try. However, we waited a while and the rice balls never came. We then asked the waiter and he said they actually ran out of rice balls earlier that day and forgot to tell us. We were slightly disappointed but decided to give them a break considering it was one of the busiest days for them. We kindly asked the waiter to remove the item from our bill but he flat out refused. Why must we pay for a dish that we never received? All other restaurant would take it off the bill without hesitation. The waiter then said he promise to owe us the rice balls and would serve it to us next time. We asked him to write down his promise on paper and he again refused. Eventually we got to speak with the manager and asked her to remove the item. She proceeded to blame the waiter for not telling us and offered us orange slices as replacement. Tired of arguing with them, we accepted. When they brought out the oranges, it was 1 orange cut into 10 slices. Wow 1 orange.   Needless to say, none of us wanted to return to this place again. We decided to take the price of the rice balls out from the tip. In hindsight, we were generous to even leave a tip in the first place. What a shame, I actually liked their food."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've gone to dim sum and discovered a new dish but I did here!!   When we first got there at 10 - prime dim sum time - the place was empty and I questioned coming but it was great and when we left at 11:30 there was a line up!  Location: Kennedy and Steeles in the markham side. Not in pacific mall  Parking: Small lot but seems like more than enough  Decor: Pretty nice. I wasn't expecting much after reading the reviews but I guess they renovated  Seating is large and medium round tables and square tables for 2 or 4.   It also looked like they had a large private room .  Food: Good. I loved the tentacles, oooh there was a pancake thing that was delicious and bbq bun was very good! Actually everything was good  Staff: Nice. They actually smiled, something that I've never really seen at a dim sum place!  Cost:  We ordered a lot and got some of the premium dishes and it was still pretty darned reasonable.  For sure we'll be back!!"}
