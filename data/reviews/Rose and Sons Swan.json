{"text":"This is one of the few places that deserves all the hype. Went for Sunday brunch, the wait staff were fast, curious - amazing. Food was fantastic, it's hard to perfect the classic breakfast but they have done it. Friends also had the hummus and the brisket, both also very recommended. Can't wait to try this place for dinner and the other location."}
{"text":"The food here is REALLY good. The music is good, servers are super nice, the art on the wall is really interesting.

I've actually come here a bunch of times for brunch and dinner, and my only real complaint is having been seated at both the back and the front tables. The lighting is terrible for both, the back is noisy from the equipment and at the front the seating is set up weird. Not enough to not go back, but enough to never sit in those spots again."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for dinner on a Saturday night. We ordered the cesar salad to share, I had the fried chicken and my boyfriend had the swan burger as our entrees. The Cesar was good, I'm not a fan of anchovies but the taste was only subtle. The salad had the perfect amount of dressing and yummy croutons but nothing extraordinary. The fried chicken was tasty but not the best I've had (compared to Electric BBQ, Frings and Carbon bar which were all slightly better in my opinion). This is because I prefer the sweeter taste of a heavy maple syrup sauce, which this dish had, but not as prominent as other places.  So if you don't prefer fried chicken to be overly sweet you would enjoy it here! The batter was spot on though, super crispy and a beautiful crunch. In terms of the burger, it was also good, comes with 2 small patties and the fries were thin and crispy, just as we like them. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Went on a brunch date with my girlfriend today after trying to get into some other places that had crazy lineups.  Glad we ended up here.  Atmosphere was warm and cozy and our waiter was very attentive.  I got the banana chocolate pancake and she got the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup.  We both got teas to go with out meals.  I was scraping the chocolate off my plate once I was done my pancake and my girlfriend ate every last bite of her grilled cheese sammy.  Our waiter, without prompting, came over three times to refill our hot water and replenish our lemon and honey.  If you're looking for good homemade food in a cozy spot, definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"I've been here now a few times. Their red fife pancakes with sour cherries is amazing!! If you're here for dinner or snacks, get the hummus. It's a must."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, food was ok. We had the mojo chicken caesar burrito, the breakfast chicken burrito and the bake of the day, which was a blondie. Nothing special, everything was bland."}
{"text":"We had brunch here a few weeks ago. When we arrived we were told it would be just a few minutes until we had a table. It was 45 minutes. When we sat down, we ordered in good time, and then proceeded to wait over an hour for our food. The explanation given was that our order \"got lost\".  People who came in way after us had their food way ahead of us... so in general they were getting the meals out in a timely way.  But ours took forever. When the food did come (keep in mind it had now been one hour and 45 minutes since we first walked up to the restaurant) one of the orders was wrong, but we were too hungry and annoyed to even mention it. Anyhow, the food was very good, but by then we were too peeved to appreciate it. Their apology was to comp us on our \"drinks\".  Four cups of coffee.  Woo hoo.  Not a great experience, for sure."}
{"text":"Having been to the old Swan, I guess I expected it to be similar. It's not. The new Swan is waaaaay overpriced for what they deliver. You order scrambled eggs, then pay for add-ons like cheese, mushrooms, peppers etc. And $4 for 2 slices of bacon? Please. I ordered eggs, bacon and 2 americanos and the bill was $25 before tip. Other spots nearby are better and less pricey."}
{"text":"Half of the negative reviews here seem to be saying \"I don't like that it changed\", which I don't get - review it for what it is, not what it used to be!

My wife and I had dinner here the other day, and we loved it. We shared the hummus to start, and then my wife had the squash fajitas and I had the banquet burger. The food was excellent - we really enjoyed each of those, the hummus in particular was great, and very original. They had a Beau's seasonal beer, which we also both enjoyed quite a bit (though it was pricey). Wish the beer list had a few more \"exciting\" beers (e.g. more interesting ales), but it was decent. Haven't tried their cocktails yet. Good veggie options, despite a lot of focus on the \"chops\". Didn't try their dessert - we'll have to go back."}
{"text":"Sometimes customer service seems to be lacking during brunch service. This was not the case at Rose and Sons Swan. The service was wonderful from each staff member we interacted with. Exceptional service plus amazing food and drink (because who says no to a mimosa) means this brunch ranks as one of the best in Queen West. At least to me."}
{"text":"I have been going to the old Swan ever since I moved to the area over ten years ago. I was sad indeed when they closed up, it was my favourite brunch place in the west end. However when I heard about the new restaurant, I was very excited to try it. 

The food: unfortunately I wasn't too impressed with my $14 scrambled eggs and one sausage. The sausage was chewy and burnt, the eggs were basic and decent, and the watercress salad was mostly just watercress stems, not easy to eat. For $14 this should be some of the best eggs and sausage around. It wasn't. The squash rosti with poached eggs and smoked salmon was however quite nice, a small portion but very nice, I'd stick with this dish if you want to treat yourself to an expensive brunch. 

The coffee was very good, although it took 15 minutes to get to me, and it wasn't that busy... which I guess is a service problem. If I took 15 minutes to serve a coffee I'd at least apologize for the wait and maybe not charge for it, neither of which happened. But I reminded myself that this is the west end after all, and WE are the lucky ones that get to be served by entitled hipsters thinking that they're doing us a favour by letting us into their shop in the first place (pardon the run-on).

The atmosphere however is still great, nostalgic, reminds me of the old spot, which will make me want to give them a second chance one day... not too soon though."}
{"text":"Great service but food is not for me. If you like fried pub like food, then come here. But if you are looking for something more sophisticated and pure high quality ingredients, then stick with something else.  Was a bit disappointed spending 17.99 on a meal (chicken - three pieces of dark meat, not grilled - and two sides). Don't come here if you are trying to eat healthy. It's greasy comfort food, which is fine if that's what you're feeling. We stumbled in here because it was the first place we saw when we decided we got hungry. Cute decor though!! Wouldn't go back just because I'm on a health kick and the meal was fatty. 3 stars for cool concept though."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday. No wait which was awesome but it was also really snowy outside so maybe it was less busy. I was disappointed that they didn't have pancakes on their menu but I ordered the French toast instead, I was in the mood for a sweet brunch and I'm not really a huge French toast fan. The French toast was awesome! I think it was the bread they used but it was really good. I'll have to come back to order the eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"For fast greasy food this place has just what you need! However, it is not your typical diner. Eggs sit on hummus with roasted Brussel sprouts and pine nuts while burgers come nestled between toasted caraway rye. Portions are decent and meals are energy-dense so come hungry and forget about your next meal as you likely won't want to eat again for the rest of the day - if you clean your plate"}
{"text":"I've been to the Swan for brunch and dinner. As a vegetarian, I found a good range of options for both meals. 

For brunch, I had the huevos rancheros, which was delicious and loaded with guac. There was a ton of stuff piled onto one crispy tortilla, but it held itself together and didn't fall apart. The beefsteak tomato added some heartiness. The portion sizes are on the small side, but the food is rich and I left full but not \"hate myself\" full. 

For dinner, I had the cheese and mushroom quesadilla, which was amazing and a pretty big portion. Perfectly crispy, even a bit flaky,  on the outside and so much cheesy goodness on the inside. 

Service is friendly, if not a bit slow, but that's pretty typical during a busy brunch rush. I was with friends catching up and we sat for a while and didn't feel rushed, which was refreshing. 

If you've been to one of Anthony Rose's other restaurants, expect similar decadence,  creative takes on comfort food staples, and to drop a bit more for your meal - in my opinion, worth it and I'll be back."}
{"text":"We had to wait a while for a table here on a Sunday--but it was absolutely worth it. My breakfast came with a delicious side of greens and the largest piece of bacon I've ever had in my life--seriously, I think it was almost 1/4 pound (I'm American, ok). The food was so good we came back the next day. The one downside of the restaurant is that the service seemed to be a bit spotty--sometimes the waitstaff would forget about us if they were busy--but they were incredible when you had their attention. Our waitress forgot to bring jam for us and my girlfriend had asked for it repeatedly--so she brought us a delicious slice of their chocolate beet cake to make it right. I was very impressed--by her efforts and by the cake!!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I heard for ages about the Trifecta or the Holy Trinity that was Anthony Rose on Dupont. I had gone to Big Crow, it was great. Haven't been to Fat Pascha yet but I hear good things. I was ready to check out Rose and Sons for brunch but my friend who lives far decided we should meet at the Queen St one. Already I knew this wouldn't be a good idea, but I went along. 

As predicted, the line on a Sunday at 11 was nuts, but we got a seat at the booth within about 20 minutes - not so bad. 
But, it was right by the door, literally, and it was January, so every 2 minutes the door would open and froze. Not just that but this place is way too narrow, so there is nowhere for people to wait in line but between the booth and the tables which is so narrow that getting up or moving is sure to hit someone waiting. 

But, aside from that, it was good. Average, maybe slightly higher than average, brunch prices. The food came quick and yes, it was good. It wasn't magical - but luckily I was warned not to judge the Dupont Rose n Sons based on this  one. I'll still check that one out. 
This was a solid spot with good food, but definitely not something to rage about."}
{"text":"Fantastic home-y atmosphere, very friendly staff and wonderful food. The proximity to Trinity Bellwoods Park is also quite nice. Will definitely come back here often!"}
{"text":"I dig it! I ate the Brisket and Cornbread here for a little brunch action and oh man, the brisket was juicy, and the cornbread was flavorful with some brie on it. Absolutely delightful, I recommend this brunch place. Plus the decor is fun to look at, so if you want to take your date here, you're good to go. 

I want to come back here!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, retro decor. This place is winning. 

The term comfort food comes to mind. Few places are this comfortable in every possible way. 

The fat pasha is awesome. The breads was a little on the burnt side. but I like it like that. 

Within walking distance to Trinity Bellwoods, this is my favorite spot"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times for lunch now and it's been great every time.

The BBQ Chicken and Pork Belly are both fantastic!

Whatever main you choose to get, you must order the brussel sprouts as one of your sides! They are the most delicious incarnation of brussel sprouts I have ever had the pleasure of eating.

The servers are very friendly but can be a little slow when the place fills up a bit, so be mindful of that if you are in a rush.

Overall, great spot!"}
{"text":"Their food was delicious and different. 

I got the Greek salad. If was far from a typical Greek salad but it was good. 

Nice restaurant ?"}
{"text":"Brunch was great. Good service. Good food. Nice morning drink selections. The avocado toast was fantastic, but I had a bite of the brisket on corn bread I felt like I missed out.  It was delicious."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever ordered here has been delicious. Especially the hummus with the brussel sprouts in it. I like how the menu changes so often; there are lots of choices every visit. Wine list is great. Cocktails are awesome. I wish they had a bigger beer selection though. More taps. They do have some different bottles, beau's seasonal beers, for example. The only negative I can say is that they get pretty busy at brunch. Service quality can go down. The prices are average. Most food I order I am unable to finish it all so I would say good portions for the money. I love this place."}
{"text":"On my first visit I got their special of 2 sides with a main. Pork Belly with Pumpkin Gritz on the side and Duck Salt Fries. Im personally trying to cut back on fries cause I eat so much but the duck salt got me. when I tried it its nothing special. Fries are fries. the pumpkin gritz however was fuckin delicious. tasted like some asian tom yum flavouring or something but I would have had a giant bowl if I could. the pork belly was on the small side, i left paying over $20 and left still hungry. the crackling on the belly was DELICIOUS and the fat and meat underneath was almost goopy. i was able to drink it. never had pork belly like that before. will come back to try your chicken!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Good Friday and it was horrendous. Waited 10 minutes at the door without any acknowledgment from the staff, when they finally greeted us we were told it would be 45 minutes for a table. I'm fine to wait for a good meal so we left a phone number and waited in the park. 

When we got a table it was the same experience as waiting at the door. Servers refused to make eye contact and took over 15 minutes to come to our table for a drink order. We ordered our food and drinks at the same time since we waited so long already. We were a party of three, two of us got the pancake extravaganza and I got the brisket, we also ordered the bread pudding to share. The menu looked really good. We waited a really long time for our food to arrive and when it finally did, we still hadn't received our drinks (one of which was just coffee!?)

The brisket was a thick but small piece of meat that was 50% a blob of fat. I like extra fatty brisket but because it was cut so thick it was just a gross ball of soggy inedible fat sitting on top of soggy cornbread with a half cooked egg on top. Really just a gross, slimy, mess.

The pancake was 1 big cold and soggy pancake with almost no syrup, with a single piece of overdone but cold bacon and a dollop of creme fresh melted UNDER two barely cooked eggs. One of the plates had eggs so underdone that just the bottom of them was white, none of us could understand how a cook let alone a chef would think they were ok to send out that way.

The server dropped the plates at our table and more or less ran away. 10 minutes later he came back to say the drinks were \"still on their way\" we told him we didn't want one of the pancake dishes (the one with the more or less completely raw eggs) and he apologized and asked if we wanted something else, we didn't as we had already been there for an hour. When he finally brought us our drinks, it was a great Caesar (which accounts for the one star)

We were going to cancel our bread pudding because we didn't want to wait any longer and everything had been pretty terrible but we didn't have to because they forgot it anyway...

This was overall a really terrible experience and shockingly bad on all fronts. I would blame the long weekend and nice weather for an overwhelming crowd but most tables had only couples so it wasn't as if they were packed to the brim either. Just lousy service and badly executed good ideas for food."}
{"text":"Great weekend brunch spot located in an interesting part of town near some cute shops.  The wait was about 45 minutes to be seated at the bar (they don't take reservations and it's not a large spot), but we had no problem killing time by exploring the boutiques in the area.

Definitely comfort food, I had the fat pasha hummus and eggs - fried brussels sprouts, hummus, eggs, pine nuts on toast - which was really original, inventive, and delicious. They have some more traditional items on the menu like pancakes and waffles, but all with their own twist (e.g. adding creme fraiches or sour jam or pumpkin).  

Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Mixed experiences here after a few visits: food has never been amazing, grilled cheese was burnt once and the wait staff seem to mostly forget about us when we are waiting to order. Biggest complaint is the music, just too loud, makes conversation difficult.

I'll come back, but never my first option."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5. 

Sat at the bar for dinner. The bartender was great and made great recommendations. Wine list is tasty, especially loved the rosé selection. We ordered the snap peas, the bread and butter, the butter lettuce, the polenta and the tuna. Everything was super tasty and interesting without being as rich as the regular Rose & sons fair.  Saw the fries and onion rings go by and totally regretted not ordering. Next time!

It is nothing like the old swan, but the diner vibe is there. Good chill crowd, nice lighting and friendly, not overly intrusive servers. I think it would a great date place.  

Totally check it out."}
{"text":"Went back the other night and the entire menu had changed. The California/Mexican theme is no longer, and has now been replaced with hearty diner fare, done exceptionally. They now have a \"Chop\" section, where you can choose a pork chop, lamb chop or bone-in New York strip. I had the apple braised Pork chop and it was bloody amazing. About an inch and a half thick, and perfectly cooked to medium. It came with pork fat roast potatoes and an appetizer plate of various pickled vegetables and garlic bread (sprinkled with parmesan, parsley and roasted garlic cloves). Delicious.

We tried the Buttered Spaghetti with Meatballs and Red Sauce another night, which was also delicious. 

The profiteroles we had for dessert were also outstanding. They came with vanilla ice cream, and were drizzled with salted caramel and topped with roasted peanuts. Outstanding. Can't wait to try the rest of the new menu."}
{"text":"Walked a little ways from our Ossington area Airbnb and found the Swan - and loved it!  I had the Swan Breakfast, a huge plate of eggs, potato toast, pea meal bacon (oh man tasty AND there was LOTS!), French fries and greens... Wasn't sure about the greens but they added a little kicker for sure! My daughter had the short stack w blueberries - and loved it too! Decent coffee, although she said she didn't like her latte much... Regardless, I'd highly recommend this place for a hearty start to your day."}
{"text":"Well, let me tell you this place is f-in delicious! It's a small joint, so expect a wait on peak hours and weekends. BUT totally worth the wait. Great spot!"}
{"text":"There was a hiccup in getting our food(the wait was a bit long) but the brunch was exceptional. We got the Brussels sprouts hummus and tongue. The tongue was perfectly cooked with delicious grits. The Brussels sprouts hummus had a unique tangy taste and the Brussels sprouts had a nice sweet sauce that balanced it out. Worked together well! Both the sunny side up and poached eggs were perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Came on a quiet weekday morning for breakfast, ordered the Fat Pasha with 2 fried eggs and was in a chill happy place full of deliciousness for the next hour. The room has lovely lamps and crazy old beloved diner vibe and good art. The waitress was friendly and calm and kind. The music was excellent. Most importantly the food was excellent. The Fat Pasha is creamy homemade hummus, pine nuts, and piles of sweet and spicy and crispy brussels sprouts and with toast and sunny side up eggs it was the perfect veggie breakfast. Heaven."}
{"text":"Took my mum here for weekday brunch and it was perfect. Food was great, portions weren't too big, and the coffee came in adorable mugs. What more could you want really?

Also, my eggs weren't overcooked, which I'd sort of given up on when eating out for brunch. RSQ FTW."}
{"text":"Definitely a pleasant surprise for a late weeknight meal when we arrived in Toronto, with a perfectly done medium rare steak frites."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great brunch burger - this should be added to your list:

PATTY MELT BURGER - caraway rye grilled cheese, fried onions, chili mayo

It was a cross between a burger (medium rare) and a grilled cheese sandwich...

Not to mention, Rose and Sons Swan has other great items on their menu and the service is friendly and prompt. This should be a 'go-to' brunch spot for anyone that lives in the area..."}
{"text":"My friends wanted to check this place out for brunch. I never pass on brunch, it's my favourite meal of the day. It's to no surprise to me when we arrive at this old looking diner located the west end of Queen St. It's got a nice, warm toasty feel to it. It definitely felt like an old diner with the high bar stools located at the front by the entrance, and the rest of the restaurant was sectioned off by cute small booths on the side fitted for four and a few tables near the back. We were a party of five so we had to do a bit of waiting before we got an open table to fit all of us. It was about a 20 minute wait which is not bad for a Saturday. I ordered the Avacado Toast ($12). I absolutely love eating or drinking anything with avacodo in it and usually have them plain with a light sprinkle of salt-pepper on toast as a quick 'on the go' breakfast. Simple! However, they added a few ingredients such as eggs, sweet and hot pepper so I wanted to give that a try. The plate was filled with colours of green, yellow and red which made it look esthetically pleasing when I saw plates of them coming out of the kitchen behind us. It was different than how I usually prepared avacodos, sadly there was nothing that really blew me away except getting my avacodo fix for the day. I could have made something slightly similiar but different if I really tried."}
{"text":"Look I am willing to pay for a quality brunch but this is ridiculous. The fish was not caviar it was canned tuna. The peas meh, the bread very meh. and they charge like it is a king's feast.
BUT you do get a small swan figure in there and a few knickknacks on the wall.
If you like food experimentation and high prices then check it out. If you want value or comforting taste then try somewhere else. Either way, definitely skip their so-called hummus. It tasted fishy. I mean it tasted of fish."}
{"text":"Girlfriend picked this place out of desperation as it was the closest thing we could find. I was not impressed with the decor of the restaurant front. It looked a tad ran down for my taste. After looking at the interior, I was still unimpressed with the consistent ran down look. We were told there was a wait, but we would be immediately seated on first table. After running around for half an hour and leaving a few other brunch places, I decided I needed to eat and just wait. 

This is where my day seemed to have taken a pleasant turn. Was seated quickly as the next booth opened up. Very cozy booth, I'd say good up to a group of 4. Food arrived in a good time. We started with the buttermilk pancakes and those were definitely good. It had nice crispy bottom, but with a nice fluffy body. A little too much syrup (prefer to have it on the side). 

Fried chicken and grits were also delicious. Fried chicken was crispy and had a unique batter. Grits were rich and hearty. The side of Brussels sprouts are a must have! It was sweet with a mild kick. Brisket and the cornbread was also amazing. Most of the brunch places I've been to usually has everything tasting the same at the end but each dish I ordered here had it's own distinct taste. Prices I thought were fair but they definitely could have charged more if the interior looked a bit more fixed up. 
Definitely will be coming back in the future if I happen to be in this neighbourhood. The place didn't really speak out to me, but the food and service definitely spoke to my soul."}
{"text":"Really pleased with my meal/experience at R&S today. It's a great little restaurant with eclectic and vintage decor. Glad we got there early enough to beat the line up.  

I ordered the Fat Pasha and I sighed with every bite - it was so good. My friend got the special which was poached eggs with salmon and bread. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked. 

I only wish the portions were bigger because I didn't want my meal to end. Friendly and prompt service to bump it up to 5 Yelp stars."}
{"text":"Decently priced brunch place. Mains range from $13-$18, and comes out to be about $20 a person with tax and tip. 

The place itself is reminiscent of a old school diner..random art covers the walls, fixed diner stools at the bar, small booths. I enjoyed the charm of this place. The food itself was pretty good. The dishes were well balanced. My breakfast sandwich (PLB melt) had cherry compote and pickles to cut the richness of the bacon and cheese. The cornbread brisket was also well balanced with some sweetness. Though the brisket was a bit too fatty for me, i can see that others might enjoy it. 

The service was pretty good/friendly. They sat us down at the bar as we waited for a table and by the time tables cleared up, we got a booth."}
{"text":"I love this cozy and yummy restaurant. I have gone about three times now for dinner and have not been disappointed. The menu has lots of different types of options for meat eaters and herbivores alike. The salads are fresh and interesting, the soup warm and comforting with the right amount of spice, and the hummus is one of the most delicious and special dishes I have ever tasted - so flavourful, spicy, rich, and warm with the spicy oil and brussel sprouts. I am craving it as I write this!

Other than the food, the service is fantastic and friendly. The atmosphere is perfect - quaint, warm lighting, cozy booths. 

I will absolutely be going back!"}
{"text":"Came here for an early Saturday brunch and tried the avocado toast. This was my first time trying the crazed new-ish item and I can say that they've nailed it! (From my little experience). I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This is based on delivery: 

Chicken Plate with Peanut Sauce: mini chicken pieces and very thin peanut sauce.

Brussels sprouts: Great 

Hummus: Great 

Mashed potatoes: VERY runny. It was liquid potatoes. 

Fries: ok 

Macaroni: average 

Overall the food is nothing to be excited about."}
{"text":"Not impressed by the food. Service was disappointing. Only thing I liked about this place was the decor."}
{"text":"Food and drink: Do not get the donuts - there was more oil than pastry and it tasted stale. Hbhs brussel sprouts were definitely the highlight of the meal. I had the fat pasha hummus dish - fine but not noteworthy. 

Service and atmosphere: The service on weekends is slow and not very attentive. The seating is squished and the decor is pretty dated. 

Overall fine if you're trying to avoid long lines at other places but I doubt I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Swan has always been about the fancy menus in a kitschy diner, and now that it's Rose and Sons Swan, it's really no different. 

We came in at a strange inbetween-y time, so they weren't serving lunch or dinner, but they still had a decent list of snacks. Incredibly varying snacks. I went for their chocolate pudding and a mint tea, others with me had their fish chowder and paté with beers. Three drastically different things, three happy customers. The only thing that was a little off, was the paté came with chips instead of bread, when asked, though, they brought us bread and there was no extra charge. 

Overall, Rose and Sons Swan is a great place on Queen W for a recharge with buddies."}
