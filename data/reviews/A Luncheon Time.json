{"text":"Cane in after seeing the 5 rating. WOW great food at great prices. Big portions and lots of meat in the corned beef sub. Bread was fresh and tasty. Homemade chili awesome. Will be stopping here during week for lunches!!"}
{"text":"This company knows catering! I was looking for an affordable catering option for my moms retirement party. A friend recommended ALT's catering, and I'm so glad that he did! These guys not only deliver exceptional quality, but affordable pricing too. Zack is great, and really wants to deliver for his guests. I will 100% use ALT again for any catering event!"}
{"text":"A Luncheon Time was the #1 place I ate back when I lived in the area. I was there nearly every day. Mary Kate's white chicken chili is the best I've had, and I haven't found one like it anywhere else. The lobster bisque is absolutely to die for and the Portobello mushroom sandwich is fab. Great for a casual dining experience, always friendly staff. You'll even see pictures their kids drew on the walls! I've had them cater a class lunch and everybody loved the meatballs. Definitely try those out at your next catered event. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A Luncheon Time cannot be beat for catering to a crowd.  

I used their catering service frequently when I worked a job requiring lunch meetings for groups of 5-85.  The variety of the menu items and the quality of the meals never failed to impress those I fed (the fajita bar and baked potato bar were 2 favorites), and the customer service did not disappoint.  

I recommended the service to several people when I used them and would recommend them highly to anyone else needing a caterer in the Northeast Ohio area."}
{"text":"Wow! I must have overlooked this place a million times! I thought it was just a catering place but it turns out it's so much more. 

My husband brought me lunch from here and it was awesome. I had the Greek chicken wrap and he had the chipotle ranch turkey wrap. I loved the Greek wrap- tons of flavor and a perfect size. The turkey wrap was good but not as delicious as the Greek wrap. Both were good sized for the price and great lunch options. It's clear they use quality ingredients and care about their food! Definitely swing by and grab an easy, healthy lunch here! 

On top of that- my husband picked up a prepared freezer meal for us to try! Bourbon chicken with red skin potatoes. With two young children, I can't wait to pop this in the oven one night and enjoy an easy meal. So awesome that they offer these and such a variety of options as well. These would be great to grab and share as gifts with people going through health or other issues. I don't know anywhere else in the area that offers this and it's so great to know! 

Thankfully my husband brought home a menu so I could peruse all the options they have. I can't wait to try some of their other options!"}
{"text":"Great spot with great people who really care about food and making you feel like you're with family. They were great when I took our little ones there and always have new, fresh foods on the menu. The take home food in the freezer offers great options as well. Highly recommended."}
