{"text":"This place used to be really good, we have been going there since they opened. They changed management a couple months ago and the food isn't as good. The last time we were there we had the garlic potatoes, something we have ordered many times, they haven't been as good lately and this time they were in-eatable. We won't be back, to bad, it was great having an option other than Chinese"}
{"text":"Two shawarmas for 6.99? Sign me up! 

The shawarmas are not that long, but they are thick! Like a soup can. Packed with filling. I get two chicken shawarmas with my girlfriend, she loves them. I almost wish I was single so I can have both for myself.

Tried the gyros meal once. It wasn't the greatest. The gyros looked it like came from a package. It was served on top of the rice, smothered in tzatziki and hot sauce. It looked like a melted strawberry sundae, and tasted just so-so. Whatever, this place is about the shawarmas!

The owner is friendly and always has a huge smile on his face. It's kind of creepy, but who cares. His shawarmas are da bomb! (For the price)

If you're in the area and got a shawarma craving, check this place out."}
{"text":"The best shawarma in Markham. Price for special went up to 7.99. Still pretty good deal"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with 2 for $6.99 shawarmas! Great place for quick and cheap shawarmas that taste good. The owner always has a big smile on his face and is super polite and friendly."}
{"text":"New shawarma place in an area that has 90% Chinese restaurant, 75% population are Chinese, and about 99% of them don't even know what shawarma is.

Banner hanging outside saying \"Lunch Special $5.99 / 2 Shawarma $6.99 Halal\"

They do have a small sign that is in Chinese saying \"middle eastern roasted meat wrap\" (in direct translation)

The shawarma I got was a bit smaller then I thought it would be, I guess it's their size is smaller. Good thing is it's stuffed with chicken and vegetables.

The garlic potato was deep fried potato quaters and then cover with some garlic sauce and hot sauce. (Not roasted potato)

Could be better, but in this area, not bad for a quick fix.

No credit card, just debit card. (Or Cash)"}
{"text":"Got the 2 shawarma special and still ended up getting charged almost $10. I regretted the decision as soon as I got in the car and took a small bite out of it. The chicken just didn't taste right, the vegetables looked soggy as if they had been sitting out forever, and the sauce was non existent. Be warned to not come here, seriously."}
