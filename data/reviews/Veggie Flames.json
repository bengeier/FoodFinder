{"text":"We were staying not far away. So we were happy to find a vegan pizza place that used Daiya"}
{"text":"Very good food and absolutely lovely people. It's tiny and out of the way but if you find yourself by the airport wanting vegan food, give it a go!"}
{"text":"Heard about veggie flames and decided to check out the hype. They do Vegetarian versions of famous non-vegetarian dishes. Went in and ordered the Kalga chilli \"chicken\". My expectations were chunks of a soya based products in a typical chili chicken style but to my dismay came some shredded soya thing with unreal amounts of onions. I was very disappointed by what was shown and the product received. Pizzas are good though. Good family run operation where they are pleasant to deal with. The Kalga Chilli \"chicken\" was the down side here. Maybe try something different."}
{"text":"A great place for good food. They have lot of choices and very friendly. Food made to order, great taste and well made. 
From
Pizza to traditional
Punjabi food everything is great."}
{"text":"Small place with few tables but has very good pizzas. Fast service and if you order in store then you can even see ur order being made right in front of you. Friendly staff. If you need to park you car then you have to come from the back of the store."}
{"text":"I had booked marked this place a few months ago and remembered just in time as I was leaving the religious congregation that I was visiting just a couple of blocks away. 

We had very little time so decided to pick up some quick takeaway. Ordered a Kalga (according to the it is supposed to taste like chicken) Wrap, a vegan Cookies and Cream Milkshake and Masala (spiced) Wedges. 

It seemed to be a quick serve, but the order took anything but quick which was a big disappointment. Second there is another mandir ( a Hindu temple) next door which complicated the parking situation quite a lot. 

First the Cookies and Cream Milkshake was close to the real one, but could still taste the coconut milk aftertaste. A tad too sweet for us. Nevertheless 3.5/5. 

The Wrap made vegan, was a a complete disaster. We have faux meat (chicken, beef, fish) however the Kalga warp is nowhere close to the real thing. Not even close to faux chicken we have had. The texture and taste was completely different and tasteless. Not chewy, not seasoned and had a red outer lining that tasted and seemed weird. The pieces were tiny squares. The Wrap was a complete turnoff. (1/5)

The spiced Wedges again was disappointing. The sauce was tangy perhaps the same they use for chaat (the tamrind chutney/sauce). The spices were non present and the Wedges would have tasted better plain!  (2/5)

Wonder how their Pizzas are and other dishes are. I was hoping to make this spot my favourite Vegan stop, but was let down."}
