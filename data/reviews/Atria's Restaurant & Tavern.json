{"text":"If you know how to order here, you're going to have a good experience.  The steaks are GREAT, the seafood is fresh and the salads are always crisp - with a good variety.  I recommend the Chicken Madiera, the Chopped Salad, the Quattro Formage and the Carrot Cake. They will also do their best to cook anything for you, even if it's not on the menu, making it a great place to go if you have wheat, nut, or seafood allergies.  The kitchen staff will often come out to make sure that you're food is prepared up to par.  Being a regular to the restaurant, I must say that the staff is helpful and SO FRIENDLY, as there's a sizable amount that has worked there since the restaurant opened in 2007. If you ask your server what they recommend, they likely will present options to you and ask you what you are interested in rather than just listing off their personal favorites.   I can also say that you MUST ask about the specials - not all servers go over them, but they are usually the best food on the menu.  Overall, this is a good place for groups, catering, a date or for a quick bite.  The prices are higher than some of the surrounding competition, but the food is also fresh and you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on my last work trip to Pittsburgh as I was looking for good food in a casual atmosphere. Had a great seat at the bar where I could relax and read my book quietly. The bartender was friendly and offer perfect suggestions. Started with the crab bisque which was by the far the best I have ever had and I'm originally from MD, the crab capital of the U.S.!!! I followed it up with a seafood trio based on the bartenders recommendation, each piece was tasty as well as perfect portions to satisfy without being overfilled. Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Waaaay overrated. Unnecessarily expensive. Sea Bass special for $28.99? Draft beer for $7.50? With sub-par service, gimme a break. Folks this is really a rip off under the hood of \"fine\" dining. Stay away."}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service. Went to Atria's while visiting the in-laws this fall and could not have been more unhappy about the experience. We were a larger party, 5 adults and 2 children and were seated in the middle of the dining area. They served my children's meals with the adult's salad course. After the salad course it took almost an hour for us to get our entrees. We were not even offered refills to our drinks while we waited. By the time the adult meals were served my children were finished and ready to leave having eaten and been finished for quite some time. My entree (Chicken Marsala) was cold when it arrived at the table and so overly sweet I was unable to eat even a quarter.   I would never eat there again and would advise anyone against doing so."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we dined here on Saturday night when there were tables full of middle or high school students attending a dance.  It was extremely noisy and when we asked to move to another table, the hostess said she had to seat us where she was told.  We ordered from the Oktoberfest menu.  Our entrees were adequate, but not outstanding.  Atria's used to be our favorite restaurant but it has declined in both food quality and service over the last few years."}
{"text":"Loved my experience here. I had one of the best cosmos I'd ever had from the bar, then had a really good dessert martini after dinner.  Since it was our first time there, we received the pot roast nachos, which my fiance and I thought were really good. We both got the steak and crab cake - both were awesome. My Caesar salad was a little on the wilty side, but that was my only complaint. Service was great, and prices were not bad for the quality of food we received. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"One of the more over rated dining experiences of late.  Varied menu and had the Copper River Sockeye.  Fish was cooked very well but swimming in a butter sauce.  The draft beer special was an IPA that was $7.50  for a pint.  Service was acceptable but very stale.  Did not see one smiling face throughout the dinner.  Very underwhelming."}
{"text":"My family went at 1:30 and it wasn't too busy.  However, service was slow and it took a long time to get the food.   I got the \"burger of the week\" which was a tomato mozzarella burger, however there was barely any mozzarella at all.  The rest of the food was good though."}
{"text":"We took my dad here Sunday March 23 for his 87th birthday dinner. We sat down and ordered drinks. Only After they were delivered and we were ready to order were we told that they were out of bread because the person who placed the order ordered 15 instead of 50 and they ran through those at lunch time (not sure why we are being told this at 5pm but it then makes you ask yourself why someone didn't go out and buy some). My wife ordered ribs but was immediately told they were out of these as well. During dinner, a bus boy stopped to fill our water and during the process dunked the end a long string bracelet he was wearing into my vodka and cranberry. My mom had to ask twice for a toasted burger bun to eat with her chicken parm. Overall the food was decent but the experience was less than pleasant especially for a birthday dinner that I paid 160.00 for."}
{"text":"Side of asparagus consisted of 5 shriveled little stems, a complete joke. Toast was also burnt on my sandwich. Both cook and server to blame here. I've enjoyed other Atrias locations, this one isn't great."}
{"text":"We dined there last weekend for dinner and the food was amazing.   The service was great and couldnt ask for a better atmosphere.   The foyer/entrance, bar area, and seating area were very aesthetically pleasing!   The servers, hostessess, and manager were very curteous.   Will definitely be going back sometime!"}
{"text":"Not terrible, not great. Ordered the blue cheese and bacon burger....the blue cheese is really blue cheese salad dressing, the bacon was a teaspoon of chopped bacon. Iceberg lettuce and a mushy slice of tomato. Disappointing. Husband had the crab bisque, said it was good. For a restaurant that tries to be 'nice', and for the menu prices....I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"What has happened! Our visit last evening was less than favorable. Service was poor, food quality has gone further than downhill. Sorry won't be going to this location anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Mmmeeeeehhhhhh. Drink specials were good. Went on a Tuesday night, we're seated immediately. Got a bunch of appetizers to split and they were not that good. The only good thing is they were cheap because it was happy hour. Went because I heard the pot roast nachos were supposed to be good. Not so much. I'd love to find a decent place to eat in Wexford."}
{"text":"I actually feel guilty about giving Atria's 2 stars, especially since this is one of my favorite restaurants and have had plenty of good experiences there.  But this review is on our latest visit (Monday, Dec. 27) and it would not be honest to have that biased based on previous visits.  The decor and atmosphere here are pleasant, and they honored our reservation perfectly.  Our first problem was with a simple request - we are on the Atria's mailing list and got a free appetizer coupon via e-mail for my wife's birthday (a week earlier).  Of course I forgot the coupon at home, and while I doubted they could do anything about it, I figured I would ask.  Our waiter was nice about it and said he couldn't get us a free appetizer, but could get us some free soup.  We said fine.  He then asked if we like crab and we said sure.  I then ordered the Ahi Tuna and my wife got a pork dish (medium-well).  The problems continued when they brought my meal out but not my wife's or daughters.  Then they brought my wife's after a delay but not my daughters.  We had to tell two people we are still waiting for a meal when finally it was delivered.  A restaurant has to know that bringing out meals at different times is very annoying and uncomfortable for all involved.  While my Ahi tuna was excellent, my wife's pork was burned to a crisp and not good.  Very disappointing.  And then we realized, why did he ask us if we like crab?  He never brought us any soup.  Anyway, it doesn't seem all that fair that a good restaurant can get a bad review based on a some screwed-up service - but that's the case.   I guess it just demonstrates that restaurants need to train and monitor the employees that interact directly with their customers."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch, waited forever. Poor service, food was horrible, asked for crackers and was handed an open package of stale saltines on a plate. Are you kidding me? Will never go back again."}
{"text":"I had the cashew breaded tilapia.  My colleague had the ribs.   Although the ribs were large, they were dry and the fish was soggy. The service may have been the slowest I've ever experience"}
{"text":"Was taken here for Mothers Day Dinner by my son and husband  We have been long time lovers of Atrias but this will be the last  Waitress wasn't friendly food was fair nothing at all like it used to be  My dinner I would rate as a 3 out of 5 scale but only because the salad and Pot Roast Nachos were so good  My mother in laws dinner was also fair nothing great   My husband on the other hand had the worst looking piece of meat I have ever seen served in a public place   Not one word said about his entire steak on the plate no lemon in the water although it was specifically asked for it just was not a pleasant experience that we have had in the past and it wasn't crowded at the time we went so that can't be an excuse  When leaving we had a gift card my husband placed it and a 100 dollar bill in the check for the total bill of 103 and change we were asked how we wanted to utilize the gift card as if we wanted to use the 100 bill and 3 bucks off the gift card leaving a balance   Sad to say I will not be taking hubby here for Fathers Day unless it is a different one"}
{"text":"While I have eaten at the other Atrias restaurants ( fox chapel & on Pittsburgh's Northside) on several occasions I had never eaten  at the Wexford locale until this past Sunday (May 3rd) and I will say that the ambiance and the setting's are similar. The food was good and the service EXCELLENT!!! Our waitstaff (a gentlemen by the name of Kevin) raised the bar to a whole new level! I would almost consider Kevin (in a word) telepathic!! He anticipated our every need and handled our large group as if we were the only patrons that day. The food was good and came out rather quickly. The portions HOWEVER were another story entirely. The price was average. Not over the top and not under, and solely going by price I would eat there again. We spent several hundred $$ there that day due in large part to the nature of the event And if I had to do it again I would.  To summarize this up, I vote w/my feet AND my dollars, AND both will be there again"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour. The staff is wonderful and very attentive. I would have given 5 stars but lately the appetizers quantity diminished. For example, I would never pay full price for their beef nachos. There is hardly any beef on the meal and it's loaded with cheese and a plateful of nachos. They used to load it up with beef but the new chef had cut the proportions. I am a regular customer and the staff said that I was not the only complaining about this. Other than that, the food is pricey but is excellent!"}
{"text":"Service was sooo  slow ....Sunday afternoon and the place hardly had anyone.  Ordered the chicken piccata and the piece of chicken was no more than 3 oz......we r leaving hungry......definitely not worth the $14 price ."}
{"text":"I believe this location is closed.  Signs out front stating new restaurant is opening soon."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a few Atria's around Pittsburgh, but the Richland Atria's is by far the best one I've been to. The food is always well prepared and the service has been excellent.  My two favorite dishes are the Crab Cakes and the Spicy Seafood Pasta."}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices. Great atmosphere,  personable staff, call ahead seating, decent size wine list."}
{"text":"I went with my wife to this restaurant to use a gift certificate and we could not have had a worse experience. The French Onion soup every raves about was undercooked - the onions were crunchy. I had the Chicken Madeira, the chicken was pink in the middle to the point where I had to send it back and the asparagus on top was raw. My wife got the Seafood Pasta, the crab stuffed shrimp were also undercooked. She ended up a few hours later with a pretty awful bout of food poisoning. The only thing that didn't make this a worse disaster was the concerned waitstaff - they were friendly and attentive.  We will  never go there again."}
{"text":"Having been at Atria's more than a dozen times over the past few months for business, I have to say that I am more than pleased every time that I go there.  The daily fish special is to die for.  Everything is always so consistent and the waitresses/waiters are friendly and attentive.  You would think that there would be a wait going in the middle of the lunch rush but I have never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Went for my mother's birthday . Place was pretty slow , but only one server . We don't go out to eat often since my mother doesn't always feel well enough to get out . We had to consoling to get service . But it was an awkward first hour and a half with nothing but bread . This place used to be awesome with the old owner and chef , my work had their Christmas parties and retirement parties here . We have had Mother's Day brunches here and never had a bad meal or service . Daly we won't be back to this location even tho we love Atria's restaurant"}
{"text":"I would give \"0\" stars if it was possible. We were told we would be seated in 20 minutes. After an hour we questioned what was happening. Low and behold after questioning they found a table to seat us at. We watched all the empty tables collect with nobody being seated. Couple beside us had reservations and they still waited an hour. An acquaintance of our party walked to out table and told us they had been seated for an hour and a half and the waitstaff never put their food order in. Absolutely terrible. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Went for Brunch on Sunday, Feb 26. Started out with a Classic Bloody Mary. At $9.00 it was a bit pricy for Gibsonia, but nicely garnished. Ordered the Crab Cakes Benedict for $16.99, described as having lump crab cakes, eggs, sauce and breakfast potatoes. Potatoes were two large, pre-made potato patties, topped with eggs and on top of each egg approximately 2/3 tablespoon of lump crab meat. Crab cake NOT. The other meal was pot roast hash at $14.99 Although not in the description, I got the same, large pre-made potato patties, topped with a lot of cheese, onions and green peppers, plus two sunny side up eggs. Well hidden were a few shreds of beef, the flavor of which was crushed by onions, peppers and cheese. Pot roast NOT. Needless to say, we were hungry as we left due to the absence of protein, and my wallet was lighter by around $60.00  One star for very poor value. Should have gone to Kings or Eat N Park."}
{"text":"Overpriced; taste like prepared food that they just heat up.  The marsala sauce on the chicken was disgusting!   I can't believe how many people eat there!  No taste, I guess!"}
{"text":"Great place and great price point. Staff is friendly and knowledgable about menu and promotions. Service was quick, and a must try is the signature pot roast nachos. Also has a nice bar area and awesome happy hour specials. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"For dinner on a weeknight, it was not a bad pick. I had the eggplant Parmesan, and it was decent. The service was fine, and our waiter was friendly. However, when we were at Atria's a few months prior on a weekend, it was terribly slow, and our waitress seemed angry. It was uncomfortable that our party's food was brought out at different times. It was generally a little hectic. You will have a much better experience if you go when it is not busy. I would certainly go back, but definitely not on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I went here last night for my birthday and had Britney as my server.  She was the best server I have ever had. And I go out to eat many times.  The food was very good except the veggies I got were dry and over cooked. But when I told her she immediately rectified the situation.   I would recommend this place to anyone.  On top of being a great server, she brought Icecream and a brownie for me for my birthday. Once I told her I was allergic to the nuts on it. She went and gave me Carmel Icecream.  Atrias really has a gem with this girl.  Such a sweetheart."}
{"text":"I love Atria's but they're experimenting with their menu and the items that I go there for are no longer available.  New items are ok but not as good as the old favorites."}
{"text":"Needing a night out and knowing we couldn't let Oktoberfest pass us by before it ended, the hubs and I went to Atria's in Wexford for dinner this past Saturday.  Being a former Atria's server, I too feel that I can pick my way around the menu so that I avoid the less \"rave-able\" menu items.  Oktoberfest is always our favorite seasonal menu, mostly because I love the potato pancakes and the hubs loves Sam Adams Oktoberfest.  After a modest wait (the place was totally full, with it appeared lots of regulars camping out in the booths), we were seated in the back and were relatively quickly (5 minutes) approached by our server.  He didn't really give us any kind of overview of the menu (which I guess we didn't need, but he didn't know that, especially with a featured menu), and from that point on he seemed disinterested and pained to be serving us.  If you come back to my table after a lengthy time away, and we wanted to order an appetizer, don't be in such a rush to get away and seemed irritated when I try to give you my order.  Seriously?  You're in the customer service business!  However, hubs was very pleased that the beer special was his favorite of all time, Yeungling, in an Oktoberfest version.  It's officially his new favorite seasonal.  I ordered the red sangria, which was heavier on the wine than any kind of juice, but that's good since it was $7, and means I got my money's worth.  We ordered the pretzels from the Oktoberfest menu for our app, and I have to say, they seemed like they were four miniatures of the freezer SuperPretzel variety for $4.99.  I wasn't thrilled, but we were starving so freezer-burned versions would have been devoured at that point.  We were never asked if we wanted soup or salad with our entrees (which is a travesty to me, how do you expect to increase your check average?) but hubs ordered the Pork Shank (something \"schweinhaxe\") and I ordered the veal medallions (weinerschnitzel).  Now, I have always ordered the chicken version (jagerschnitzel) but decided to do something different.  The veal was three small medallions, heavily breaded with very little actual meat, and the single potato pancake -- which was the size of the width of a coffee cup, and it was supposed to be the main side -- was charred beyond belief.  It was so hard, I couldn't cut through it with a knife.  When I mentioned it to the server, his response was \"oh they premake them, baking them earlier and then cooking them the rest of the way when they are ordered.\" WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND would say that to a customer?? I know that is how it is done in most restaurants, but seriously, don't EVER say that to the customer.  Not only that, it's a terrible excuse for the poor quality of a potato pancake, and I was not offered another.  The other side?  A pile of messy onion straws.  This is not a SIDE, it's a garnish.  For $20.99, I expected so much more.  And I paid EXTRA to add kraut spaetzle to my order because I wanted to try it, but thankfully had it because I was still hungry.  The hubs enjoyed his pork shank, which was practically the size of his head, but impossible to finish.  Along with it came the traditional redskin mashed potatoes, which are always a hit with him (especially with the Pot Roast).  He had minimal complaints, but felt bad that mine didn't turn out as well as I had hoped.  I have to say, past times I have done Oktoberfest at Atria's have been a pleasant experience, but the food and service quality this time were just subpar for me.  Definitely missing the Robinson location, which I felt had excellent service and food."}
{"text":"Just terrible service. From the time we walked in to the time we left it was 2 hours for 4 people. This is the second time this happen to us. I guess shame on me for being fooled the second time. There won't be a third, we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch. Service spotty. Chopped salad ok nothing special extremely small portion for price.  Fra Diablo pasta. BLAND very little meat, dirty plate  Crab bisque sandy, had shells in it. Looked like waiter spilled on side of bowl. Did not ask if I wanted bread until half of meal was gone and there were 6 people in section. Not worth the money they charge."}
{"text":"Not worth the cost of the food. Nice atmosphere but the food doesn't match. Probably would not go back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to any Atria's since having my bridal shower at one of their locations 10 years ago.  I stopped at this one for an early (3:00) dinner with a party of four and we were all disappointed with our food.  The crab bisque soup was good, but the entrees were bland, overcooked, and/or rubbery (pasta and shrimp).  I ordered the fish tacos and found them to be the absolute worst I've had in my life.  The tasteless fish was dry and stringy; the tortillas were probably soft at one time, but were either stale or baked to an unpleasant crispness under heat lamps by the time they reached me.  We left most of our meals on our plates, paid the $75 bill, and bid farewell forever to this chain.  On the positive side, our server was kind and attentive.  Our food took a long time to emerge from the kitchen, but she was obviously not responsible for the wait.    The decor at Atria's desperately needs some refreshing.  The wallpaper looks worn and dated (even by the fusty traditional standard they seem to be striving for) and the overall atmosphere was too great-aunt's-tea-room-in-a-strip-mall for me.  Maybe this is supposed to be elegant?  It just comes off as sad.  In a region with so many dining options, I can't imagine a reason to choose Atria's."}
{"text":"I have loved Atria's for well over 15 years starting with a different location but transferring to this one after moving but today was the last straw in a long line of them.  Made online reservations and was shocked that they had so many open availability that should have been a warning sign to me along with the current star rating.  Made the reservations and went and it was not crowded at all and there was no wait at all for seating  The waitress was not the friendliest sort but that's ok as long as the job is done they don't have to be.  An omen of things to come was when asked if they had they children's tortellini and was told no they changed the menu and it was the typical burger, chicken tenders etc...nothing special not even the ribs they used to have but alas it happens.  So we order our normal Pot Roast Nachos and Martini with a Mothers Day Salad which my wife said was delicious so far so good you say but alas I have to mention I had asked for water with lemon and of course it came without the lemon so maybe I'm batting 50% right now...maybe  Then the food comes my wife had the Pork Gorgonzola my mother Ham Steak and my toddler since not much of a selection just pasta.  I ordered the same thing i have ordered for the past 15 years a filet no blood with smashed redskins no onions.  The food was delivered and to be honest my wife's, mothers, and sons looked good enough although his pasta was just plain penne with it looked a smelled like Ragu or Prego but he liked it well enough.  Mine well lets say i have been eating steaks and I only eat filet and certain prime rib places......upon arrival I had to use the light on my camera to see if it was actually a steak because it didn't look like a steak let alone a filet.  Pictures will be attached for your viewing i just ask that if you view the steak before eating and lose your appetite please do NOT blame me unless you are on a diet and that is your motivation...I think I am going to use it for mine.....lol"}
{"text":"The food and ambiance are above average, although I found the staff to be a bit snooty.  I guess I need to get a Mercedes before I go back."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and good service. The patio, when open, is small but well appointed with heaters which keep the chill off in the fall.   The regular menu seems pretty ho-hum, but everything is delicious. It's one of those places where you feel like you are settling on a meal, and then it just blows you away. They usually have great seasonal menus as well. Oktoberfest is NOT to be missed. It's the best menu of the year, hands down!  Atrias has been around for years, and it's not surprising that the decor is just starting to look a bit worn."}
{"text":"Servers busy talking instead of serving. Food is ok.  I understand there are regulars but to ignore us who could become regulars hmm."}
{"text":"Went here Thursday night, as this is one of my Grandma's favorite restaurants. She had raved about the crab bisque, but we were so disappointed with what we received. Everything from the presentation to the taste was just not good. My grandma had the fish and chips and the chips were completely soggy. My FIL had the hamburger, which was OK but the chips were overcooked and salty. Everyone else's meals were just OK. My grandma left disappointed that her favorite restaurant went so downhill and embarrassed that she had raved so much and brought her family here."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first visit... Service was great...pleasant, on the ball.  We don't eat pork - and in most restaurants after i make this clear, i will often receive an appetizer or salad with bacon or ham in it...Here they were thoughtful enough to make this conclusion on their own - which i appreciated.  The food was great!  I started with their chopped salad - which was very fresh and included goat cheese - of which i'm a big fan.  I then had chicken parmagiana - the chicken was a good size portion and not over cooked.  The side of pasta tasted like they'd just made it - it was really fresh and not over-cooked.    My wife had pasta ala vodka with shrimp.   The shrimp was tender, the sauce was flavorful.  The prices are reasonable for what you get.    I have only one suggestion.... at one point they offered us a free appetizer as \"first timers\" - which had beef in it - which we also don't eat.  But then they didn't offer us an alternate....  Otherwise it was  a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Crab Bisque - way too salty Eggplant Parmesan - good  Decent Italian for a chain restaurant.  colleague recommendation"}
{"text":"Service was mediocre at best, but I think our waitress was new. The food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I love the Quattro Fromage Dip with the seasoned baked pitas. And they definately have the BEST crab bisque in town!"}
{"text":"We went here for Sunday dinner. It was not busy or slow. Here is what we ordered: Pot roast nachos - 3 stars Pork filet gorgonzola - 3 stars Sherry crab bisque - 4 stars Jumbo crab cakes - 4 stars (with 4-star French fries, 2-star mac and cheese, supposed to come with cole slaw but out of stock) Service - 3 stars"}
{"text":"From what I see, I'm in the minority when it comes to Atria's. It was OK at best.  My wife enjoyed her Baja Fish Tacos, but my Rotisserie Chicken Wrap was less than expected. Not much taste at all. Cole slaw had relish in it. Not particularly good, but different. For a half empty restaurant, the servise was pretty slow.  Have eaten at the Atria's in Mt. Lebanon & wasn't impressed with the one, either."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this Atria's location. I came for the pot roast nachos on a recommendation and was not disappointed. It was practically a meal in itself. Also had the chicken tortilla soup which was in its last day for the winter menu.   I was VERY impressed with the service. Our waiter was great but it really seemed like everyone there was committed to great service. I don't see this kind of service at this price point too often.   If you're in the Pittsburgh area and looking for a meal, it would be a crime to miss Atria's."}
{"text":"My paddle team came for drinks and dinner after a weekday practice.  The 6 of us enjoyed a half price cocktail during the last 5 minutes of happy hour.  I recommend the lemon drop.  The chef came out with a complimentary fried zucchini appetizer when we told the waiter it was our first time to this particular Atria's location.  My salmon dinner was cooked just right.  Service was friendly and attentive.  I would be happy to return soon!  Our waiter brought separate checks too without a fuss."}
{"text":"My recent trip to Atria's consisted of my 4 year old son, 11 month old daughter and myself.  We were so pleased about the German foods being served for Oktoberfest.  I ordered something I would never order.  It was called the Strammer Max.  It was so good.  I am glad I went outside of my comfort zone to try it.  Our service was spectacular.  I never had to ask for a drink...one of my pet peeves is an empty glass."}
{"text":"Told me there was a 20 minute wait while the restaurant was 60% empty at 7:45 PM on a Wednesday .   I have given this place many chances over the years and they always manage to disappoint.   Prepare for medicore service, food and disappointment."}
{"text":"The place is alright in general, not typically impressed most often, but good for a consistent good dinner.  We had a waiter on Easter though that was fantastic and enjoyable, the food is a bit pricier than standard fare, but things are alright....if you are going hit it IP during Oktoberfest in which I would give an additional star."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of weeks ago on a weeknight with my girlfriend.  I had been to this Atria's before but was not a huge fan of it and so it had been a few years but this was the first time for my girlfriend.  The inside of this restaurant looks clean and spacious.  Since it was girlfriends first time, the chef sent us out a some little plates with one of their \"famous pot roast nachos\" on it for each of us.  It was pretty good as you would imagine a single tortilla chip covered in meat and cheese probably would be.  Whenever we ordered I decided to start off the evening with a bowl of sherry crab bisque before my entrée of the pork gorgonzola.  Our soup came out in a reasonable time period and both my girlfriend and I really enjoyed it. My pork gorgonzola was 3 round pork filets that were wrapped in bacon, covered in BBQ sauce and gorgonzola over top of potato pancakes.  It definitely was not what I was expecting whenever I ordered the meal but it was good nevertheless.  The gorgonzola and BBQ sauce both provided some strong flavors to the moist pork which helped it to taste good.  At this point between the nachos, soup and pork filets my girlfriend and I were full and called it an evening.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back here again in the future.  While it certainly would not be my first choice in places to go, I was pleasantly surprised by it this last time and enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"People rave about this place but I just see an over-priced restaurant with odd menu choices.  I'll never go back but to be truthful. I like local cuisine much better than chains."}
{"text":"Local chain.  Menu isn't too big.  Ambiance is great.  THey aren't pushy if you'd like to sit and chat after a meal."}
{"text":"One star is a compliment. This was my second and last time at this restaurant. The food was cold and when we complained to the manager, they took our plates to the kitchen, warmed them up in the microwave and brought them back. We had pasta and had to beg for the grated cheese."}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience at Atria's...Food is good, prices average for the area and waitstaff always attentive. Salmon Salad is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"As a party of 7 we started with 2 orders of the pot roast nachos. These could have made the meal alone!The pot roast was so tender and complimented the nacho ingredients superbly. For my entree I ordered the pork filet gorgonzola-small pork filets wrapped in bacon with gorgonzola cheese sauce served individually over a small potato pancake, In addition to myself getting this entree, 4 other members of the party ordered it as well. We were all very satisfied with the flavors and quality. Our server was attentive and there when needed but did not hover or rush us from enjoying our precious family time together."}
{"text":"had dinner here two weeks ago with family and was hugely disappointed.  we could not sit at the bar during happy hour because of my husband's bad knees and were told we could get the happy hour prices for drinks.  i got stiffed $9 for a half glass of Moscato and they refused to discount it.  The meal was not much better.  I ordered a turkey ruben and the turkey was so thick i could not bite through it.  It had an odd taste to it, so i boxed it to take home and ended up throwing it out after i was up part of that night with gastric distress.  our bill was $50+ for very little.  Will not make this mistake again.  There are lots of other really good restaurants in the area that don't charge near as much with much better food."}
{"text":"Oktoberfail @ Atria's in Wexford...  This restaurant established in the 1930's Atria's has experienced a steady decline in food. The Atria's of 5-7 years ago took pride in the food delivered to the table.  Unfortunately today the attempt to create an Oktoberfest meal is an overwhelming task for Chef Josef Karst.   Three entrees and not one was satisfactory, the Sauerbraten was not marinated, it was Roast Beef topped with sweet and sour gravy, with a side of Spittle which was closer to Gnocchi lathered in a sodium bath. The spaetzle was inedible on any of our Entrees.  The Jagerschnitzel was a breaded pork sandwich with a side of sliced bake potato with onions and bacon and finally the Knackwurst was an assortment of 3 sausages and a side of the inedible spaetzle 2 of the 3 knackwurst were absent of flavour.    One star was achieved for the cheese soup (which likely was not made in house).  When we mentioned the quality of the food to our waitress Courtney, she asked if we would like dessert.   We inquired if Chef Josef Karst created them and she said \"Yes\" we said \"Check Please\"."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time since my mother in law died.  She and her husband loved the Octoberfest there but we found many items not available especially the potato pankcakes.  Sent my spätzle back because it came out in one big blob!  We had reservations so perhaps they should of called and told us their menu was limited"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I used to really enjoy some things about this place years ago. We went back for the once-delicious pot roast nachos. This appetizer used to be very good but this experience was much different. It started with stale bread, continued with a soggy, cold excuse for the signature nachos, and got worse, ending with subpar entrees. The meat in the steak salad had been heated-up from being cooked some earlier time and the bacon wrapping around the shrimp kebab was not crispy or even fully cooked. The rice pilaf quality was equal to that of a frozen TV dinner. I left two stars because the service was ok and I'm hoping this was an off-night for this place, for their sake. I won't be returning anytime soon to find out."}
{"text":"I've been on a pumpkin kick lately, so my dinner at Atria's was the pumpkin ravioli with apple cream sauce. I loved the pieces of cinnamon apple in this dish. My only complaint is that the edges of some of the ravioli were dry, but overall my dinner was good."}
{"text":"If you are looking for atmosphere that makes you feel like you were in the third Godfather movie, then this is your restaurant!  The meals are overpriced, service is slow, and the food is about on par with The Golden Corral.  Dated 70's look, and menu.  I wondered why so many elderly people were there...clearly it was due to the fact that the place is a page out of the 70's \"fine\" dining.  Save your money and your palette!"}
{"text":"We were up in the Wexford area late that night in July when Pittsburgh had all of that flooding. At 9PM, the place was about half full and we were seated right away. Our server, Roni(?), was excellent. Our drinks came quickly, along with some fresh bread, which was delicious. We both ordered New York Strips, cooked medium, and they were prepared correctly and tasted very good. I'm pretty sure I had lobster bisque, which was excellent. The ambiance was very nice; it seemed like a classy old steakhouse. I had never been to an Atria's before, so I'm glad I had a good first experience. Overall, the waitstaff gave us the best service that I've had at any restaurant in a long time."}
{"text":"I've been to three different Atira's locations a number of times and it seems to me that things in general, but particularly service, are going downhill. Despite a dining room nowhere near full, people were not being expediently seated, presumably due to a shortage of waitstaff. Even with a reservation, we were not seated on time. Once seated, our drink order, water and the drinks all came quick, and with the drinks came a promise from our server to \"be back real soon\" to take our dinner order. By that, he meant after taking and entering orders from a table that was seated a significant amount of time after ours (and they were likewise wrapping up their meal before we even got our entrees). Then, one diner at our table was told that the pork chop was out (and this was after being delivered our soup/salad course). Being out of something on the regular menu isn't acceptable, nor is not being told upfront or at least immediately after ordering. Then there were little things, that, once accumulated, are substantial -- a long wait for the entrees, being short a set of rolled silverware, being delivered bread with no bread plates, one entree being lukewarm while an identical one was hot, some very hot plates and some not (heat lamps aren't cool, kids), and a very messy neighboring table that remained uncleared for quite some time after the diners left.  On the plus side, despite service flaws, the server made up for it in some ways with charm, humor and friendliness. And the place still provides a reasonably good value for the money. The chopped salad and crab sherry bisque are still winners and the entrees not bad for a local chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here last week for dinner with family. I ordered the crab bisque which was very good. I also had the Chicken Madeira. The chicken and asparagus was very good, but the mashed potatoes were so salty I could hardly eat them. The prices are on the upper side of cheap. I will probably think twice before coming back sometime soon."}
{"text":"We had a gift card so we decided to give it a chance even though our last trip there was horrible. The kids menu is horrible, we ordered the kids burger and they were like hockey pucks. My other kids order a $13 burger off the main menu asked for medium and came out brown throughout. My grilled chicken salad was ok came out in a greasy taco shell, and my husband's chicken parmesan was just ok. We decided to get dessert and got the carrot cake, it tasted like the refrigerator disgusting. I didn't say anything to the staff since our kids already had enough and didn't want to drag out our time there. We definitely won't go back."}
{"text":"I took my daughter to Atrias for dinner tonight. I ordered a pacific salmon salad and she had a chicken salad. Both meals came in a reasonable amount of time and our server was nice. However the meal had no flavor and the salmon wasn't seasoned and the entire salad was bland bland bland. My daughter also said her had very little flavor or appeal. We were both so hungry we decided to salt and pepper until we could taste something. Our server asked how the salads were and we replied that there was little if any flavor but decided not to send them back because we had a short window of time. After that she never came back only to give the check. And someone grabbed my plate after I was done eating but my daughter was still eating her meal. This is rude. No restaurant should ever take one diners plate while another is still eating. It makes us feel rushed and not welcome to leisurely enjoy the food, even though there was very little to enjoy anyway. This is a bad policy and restaurants should stop this practice. Very doubtful I would ever want to return. Unflavorful and bland dishes, so so service and an overall unpleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant one-half star I would. My husband and I had dinner there last night, and the food was terrible. Husband had ribs, which were very overcooked and dry, no flavor, French fries were cold. I ordered the shrimp etoufee with no rice. Broccoli on the side instead. I received half a bowl of mostly sauce, which had to be reheated. There was exactly one piece of shrimp, several tiny scallops, and about 3 oz of salmon. Flavor was almost non-existent with no evidence of Cajun seasonings of any kind. Service was fair. Food was expensive. Those two items plus two iced teas totaled $50. Décor needs to updated desperately. Highly disappointed - I had previously enjoyed a good meal at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Against my better judgment because of bad experiences the past couple times, we ate lunch here.  The food was beyond terrible I hate to say. Even the Pot Roast Nachos-which I used to love!  They came out half the size that they used to be and loaded with pot roast \"sauce\" with a few measly pieces of meat and the cheese was barely melted.  The service was also terrible.  It took an extremely long time to get our meals and we could never find our waitress to ask for refills or a bread plate to at least eat something as our meals were (over) cooked.  Take my advice and do not eat here.  For the high cost of an awful dinner at Atria's there are so many better restaurants to visit.  I hate  to say it but Atria's day is over and it is evident in every part of the experience.  It is not just this location too-the one near PNC Park is just as bad."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Atria's for a few years now.  In the beginning, I thought this place was great!  It used to be special.  But lately, I have started to notice things are changing and I don't like what is happening here.  Doesn't matter if we are visiting on a week day evening or weekend.  While service is somewhat attentive, food seems to be an issue.    For example, during Atria's Oktoberfest, it took well over one hour to get our meals.  It started with the dinner rolls.  They didn't have any.  The excuse?  The Oktoberfest menu takes a lot of oven space.  Later, we got some cold rolls.  When we asked why the rolls were different, we were told that someone ran to the store to get them.  As for our meals, mine was not cooked.  I got the Schweitzer Schublig appetizer which was grilled sausage wrapped in a puffed pastry.  The pastry was still doughy.  It was so bad, I could not eat it.    On our most recent visit, we were greeted by a crabby hostess.  She was downright surly.  That day, we came in specifically for the Monday night special - Chicken Pot Pie.  And at 6:15 pm, they were out of Chicken Pot Pie.  So, instead, I got a bowl of wedding soup.  The tiny meatballs and carrots were good, but the chicken was dry, even in broth.  And it was so salty!    Another thing that is troublesome is the condition of the interior.  It's getting worn and needs a refresh and a good cleaning.  On our last visit, our booth cushions were very stained.  This can affect your appetite.    Also, I do not believe that the staff has been properly trained.  I have called in before to find out what the specials were and the person answering the phone said that she didn't know.  No offer to check the menu.  She just said she didn't know.  Obviously management has lost interest in this place.  And it shows."}
{"text":"My husband and I had noticed this restaurant many times, but until today we had never been inside.    I am thrilled we decided to JUST GO.     I had read the Yelp Reviews, so I asked our waitress to recommend a drink since we \" had never been there before \" ... she said liked the margarita.  My husband ordered the house margarita and I chose water.   Good margarita.  We ordered the Fried Zucchini appetizer.     A gentleman ( I can only assume manager or at least assistant ) bought us out a free pork nacho appetizer, he took the time to welcome us to the restaurant and state they offer it to all first timers.   They were delicious!  Then our Fried Zucchini came out, very good also!   Large portion and awesome marinara sauce.  I selected the Char Grilled Meatloaf Stack with hand cut fries instead of the smashed Redskins.     DELICIOUS!!!!   Yummy meatloaf, actually happy I was full at that point, because now I have leftovers.  Jalapeño Cheddar Corn Bread is Amazing!    The fries are good too.   Just realized writing this, I did not get my onion straws...minor oversight.  My husband had the hand breaded cod sandwich with homemade potato chips.    He said he would try something different next time, only because he likes a battered fish more than a breaded one.   We loved the homemade chips.  We will go back.   Thank you for a wonderful date night."}
{"text":"Had dinner there with my girl tonight. Service was fine, but the food was very poor. Salad had some brown lettuce in it.. Crappy croutons, and the potatoes I had with my dinner were BURNT. The chicken was ok, but for what you pay for, you'd think they'd have decent lettuce at least! Not work the money."}
{"text":"If this restaurant is closed, good riddance I say.  Food and service was impeccable at one time.  That time passed many years ago.  We loved this place so much that my daughter had her wedding shower and two years later a baby shower.  That was 2009 and 2012 respectively.   My wife and I noticed the degradation of the food and the service over the years as we continued to patronize the establishment. Unfortunately, each passing month and year saw Atria's sliding into oblivion.   Launch to 2016, we both previously loved the crab bisque, my wife adored the chicken Marseille.  The huge sandwiches, especially the Reuben was my Favorite.    Last visit was May 2016.  We arrived around 1:30 to an almost empty dining room and were seated immediately. This is when things went horribly wrong for any restaurant that wishes to succeed.  After waitress finally took order, 15 minutes to get drinks. (Restaurant had only two other tables).  Placed order quickly after receiving drinks and inquired why chicken Marseille was not on menu?  This was always a signature dish of Atria's, yet we were informed they are \"shaking up the menu\".  Reluctantly, my wife ordered a different dish and I ordered the old standard and always solid Reuben! Both of us ordered a bowl of the crab bisque which I always wanted to be submerged for eternity.  To the point finally, crab bisque was cold, very salty and had no velvety feel as before.  Rita's substitute for the Chicken Marseille was so uneventful that she ate only 1/3 of the dish and wanted no doggie bag as it was basically barf.  My Formerly immaculate Reuben was stone cold, dry and had no thousand island dressing.    Please consider, this miserable food took approximately an hour in an almost empty restaurant.  When I questioned our waitress of the slow service from the kitchen, she stated they \"had a very busy former lunch crowd and they were still busy in the kitchen\". I asked \"are they busy cleaning the kitchen because they aren't cooking\"?  In closing, the manager took my Reuben off the bill and offered to wrap the 1/2 I didn't eat because it was so terrible.  I said no thanks because I did not want free food.  I tipped our waitress 30% and swore we would never return.  It is a shame if this location has closed but obviously long overdue.  They lost all controls of quality and service."}
{"text":"Pot roast nachos have long been a favorite, but tonight's serving was light on pot roast...some on every tortilla please!  Another issue...3 of us came in for ribs, another fav, but they were out. 8 o'clock on a Saturday night and no ribs...c'mon folks!  Might explain why there's only 6 tables seated at 9pm on a Saturday:/"}
