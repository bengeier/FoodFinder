{"text":"We discovered this truck at the Glendale farmers market and love the burritos and tacos.  We had their truck at my son's 10th birthday party and it was a total hit!  Everyone loved the food, killer salsa bar and amazing smiling faces serving the food.  I would totally recommend them to cater any event.  And we of course will have them at our next party"}
