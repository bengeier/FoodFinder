{"text":"After standing and waiting for the hostess for 5 minutes as servers ignored us, the hostess finally arrived only to take the name of the group standing behind us.  Did not acknowledge our presence.  We left immediately after."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. I was blown away how horrible it was. Took twenty minutes for the hostess to figure out who out server was and after that we would see her once every 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I was craving a good burger for lunch today so I looked to my fellow Yelpers to direct me to the best place in Beachwood.  The Pub had the highest rating and I've never been there before.  I love good food and I love trying new places so I was sure it was going to be a win-win situation.  Unfortunately, it was not.  I called in my order for carry out and the gentleman who took the order was very nice so no problems there.  He even repeated the whole order back to me to be sure he got it all correct: a traditional burger done medium-rare on a brioche bun with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, and basil aioli to be served with the standard chips (fries).  Perfect.  He said it would be ready in about 10 minutes- which I was super happy about as I was quite hungry by the time I ordered it.    No one was at the host station when I arrived, and there were only about 10 to 12 customers that I could see, but there was a server at a nearby table that called over and said she would be right with me so I just waited there.  A couple minutes later another server came to help since the first one hadn't freed up yet.  I gave the gentleman my name and he came back with my bag.  i paid and left.  When I arrived back at the office I was horribly disappointed with what I found.  They forgot the basil aioli so my burger was completely plain in terms of sauce (and there was no courtesy packets of mayo or mustard in the bag for me to throw on it in the absence of he aioli), the tomato stem was still playing an active roll in the tomato slices life, and when i cut the burger open it was overdone.  Definitely not the amazing burger experience I was hoping for.  I still gave it 2 stars instead of just 1 on the grounds that they do have a diverse menu, the staff I encountered all seemed pleasant, and they had a super quick turnaround time on carry out orders at lunch time- which is rare in the Beachwood area.  Based on the other reviews, I want to believe my experience was just a fluke but I'm not really sure if I would be willing to potentially waste another $11 for one burger on the attempt."}
{"text":"Had the pumpkin ale with brown sugar on the rim. Got the marinara and goat cheese dip which was incredible."}
{"text":"Live this place! Get the pub spring rolls or the pot roast, they're amazing! Trivia on Mondays, half priced bottles of wine on Wednesday, and music on Thursdays."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our experience here today. The atmosphere was very cozy. The decor is very similar to pubs in England. We had fish and chips and it was great, would definitely order again. The only negative was my friend ordered a beer but was told it was only available on the beer wall. He didn't really want to get the card, have to go across the restaurant and pour his own beer so he ended up ordering something else. It would be nice if those beers could also be served."}
{"text":"While spending two months in Cleveland I spent a fair amount of time there for dinner and drinks. The bartender Ashley was awesome and very good at her job. She was advising me on food to get and some drinks. She made me feel welcome all the time when I was there. I would recommend this place for the food and the service."}
{"text":"The Pub is a great place to eat. The beer selection is great, lamb burger was very good, but the bread pudding with scotch is OUTSTANDING."}
{"text":"Saturday night;found a seat right away at 8:30pm; big place at  Beachwood Mall; attractive decor.Happy to hear Fatheads Shakedown Stout available on tap- but initially was brought a beer that tasted like \"NO WAY! THIS iS NOT SHAKEDOWN\" Ended up getting one  pint free bc it was a mistake.  Menu is a great balance of American bar& Grille favorites (Artichoke/spinach dip, various soft Pretzel combos + sandwiches with pretzel buns, chicken wings, fried pickles) and British items like Shepherd's Pie, Fish&Chips, Soups, Bangers and Mash & British Beers, though they are smart to maintain a fair American balance here, as their beers are, The - Best- In - The- World! My Whole party was very satisfied with the food, service and decor."}
{"text":"we walked in and thought what a nice place. Too bad we didn't get to try any food. After 5 servers looked directly  at us, three different servers visited the table next to us, and not one server came to our table after sitting there for 15 minutes we walked out. No excuse for not properly training the staff"}
{"text":"First time visiting The Pub. My husband and I were greeted promptly in a cordial manner. We were seated in a comfortable booth. Taking a look around the decor was impressive. We were told every thing was imported from the UK, down to the light fixtures. The wood work, and glass, on the already impressive bar was beautiful. Our waiter was friendly and professional. We ordered the fried pickels for an appetizer, they were spears unlike the chips, which to me were much better, with a teeny kick. The beef burgers we ordered were outstanding! We will definitely he coming back"}
{"text":"The fried pickles are wonderful! Great selection of UK beers and my steak burger was perfectly cooked!"}
{"text":"The Pub in Beachwood Ohio had its Grand Opening on January 20, 2014....it is now in the spot where McCormicks and Schmidts were....I came in and was greeted with nothing but smiles and in a very friendly way.....I choose to sit at the bar and met server who was awesome Joe n Zack.....the decor was lovely totally revamped from what I remembered from the old restaurant that was there.....I got my cider beer which they have Angry Orchard....I didn't do the fire ball but I will next time....I sampled the Stella Artrois/Stella Cidre just loved them so next time I'm ordering those....now down to the bizness.....the food..... I'm not really big on beef so I ordered the Turkey burger with cranberry apple chutney that was recommended and it was simply deelish...I love it....it came with white cheddar cheese, pepperwood bacon, I got grilled onions on a toasted brioche bun that came with steak fries and a fried pickle...the fried pickles are also on there app menu but I thought fried pickles who eats those....well I do now....and after tasting the fried pickles I should have ordered the app...but my bartender was so awesome he went into the back and got me another one.....so I give this spot a 5 first time very impressed from the welcome to my server to my food....so stop by and check them out.....I think you'll like it as much as I did."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great meal. We were from out of town and wasn't sure where to go for lunch. Pulled into the mall and this place looked really nice. The servers were great. The spinach and artichoke dip was great (served with warm pita bread which was a nice change from chips.) I tried the pulled pork with Mac and cheese. It sounded like a weird combo, but the waiter said they just changed their menu and to try it. I am glad I did! I definitely recommend to try this place."}
{"text":"We love this place! Never a bad experience with the food, and they even handled our large party for my rehearsal dinner wonderfully. The lamb burger is tasty"}
{"text":"We had a group of 6 people for our team lunch today. We had a reservation but didn't need it since it was so early.   The atmosphere was fun and the wait staff wear kilts!   Great menu with a variety of things. There is something for everyone! We had fried pickles that were good. Nothing special about the breading. The spring rolls with black beans were really tasty.   I ordered the tomato basil soup which was amazing! I would go back just for that. I also has the cranberry pecan spinach salad with chicken. It was good, typical salad."}
{"text":"Originally I went there for a beer with a friend. They have a decent happy hour with a pretty good beer selection. The service was good and the bartender did a good job introducing us to some new beers.   I went with a big group to get dinner and they easily accomidated us. I got a sandwich with turkey and coleslaw that was tasty. Everyone's food was good. This is typical English pub style food, so fish and chips and Shephard's pie are prominent.   It's a nicer atmosphere for an informal dinner or quick drink with a friend. I really liked the decor."}
{"text":"Located in the mall, which wasn't obvious from the listing. Depending on where you're coming from could be hard to spot. But once you round that corner of the mall, there's no missing it. Tons of parking, plenty of space inside. During early hours this would be pretty family friendly, but would turn more bar than restaurant at night.  Great draught beer menu, many British ales and lagers. Great bottle menu, many Belgians and euro beers for those who know their stuff and good exploring for those who are looking for something new.  Had the lamb burger because you don't often see that on a pub menu. It was delicious and cooked to order, medium - not well, not raw.   Service was very friendly and attentive.  Also, they have an excellent malt and bourbon selection. So a good stop for you scotchy-scotch people thinking of heading here."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Excellent service!  If you go on Wednesday its 1/2 off select bottle of wine.  I usually have the beef stew with mashed potatoes or Bangers and Mash (sausage & mashed potatoes). Yummy!  The appetizers are very tasty as well."}
{"text":"Whenever I travel, I like to try local places and if they offer Pub fare, I often try the Fish and Chips. The beer-battered haddock came out in a sizable portion, light and crispy and the chips were delicious. Cole slaw was fresh and the house-made tartar had just the right zing. Definitely a good choice for dinner!"}
{"text":"Solid restaurant and excellent service.  Had the turkey sandwich and it was very good.  I will be back next time I'm in town for a beer.  Carlsberg on tap!"}
{"text":"Great pub food and awesome service! Ashley is fantastic, we are not local but come in for business a couple times a month and she knows everything there is to know about bourbon and introduced us to our new favorite! She also has the patience of a saint, we tested it by bringing our kids along last time."}
{"text":"Probably one of the neatest places I've ever walked in, huge bar and amazing atmosphere! We ordered spinach and artichoke dip that came with warm pita, very yummy! I made the mistake of panicking and getting a turkey sandwich that was extremely boring, I could've made a better one at home. My boyfriend ordered the Shepard's pie which he enjoyed but we agreed some of the portions weren't worth the price. We loved the beer/cocktail menu, I'd go again for drinks and shareables but probably not a full meal. I can't totally knock it because it was such a neat place and our waitress was beyond awesome and knew her stuff. Quite impressive."}
{"text":"Decor was better executed than food or service. Burger was cooked as ordered and pretty tasty, but the garnishing was below average (hardly any sautéed onions, burger sitting in a pool of BBQ sauce) and fries  were blah.  Service was a little slow and non-attentive. Nice band playing during HH.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Everything is ridiculously overpriced. Asked for an appetizer of fries and got literally 10 fries for basically $4. Just mind blown. Also, 3 pieces of fried chicken, mac and cheese, and small greens for $13? I could get a whole basket of 12 pieces of fried chicken for $10 at KFC.  Just not worth it."}
{"text":"Huge fan.  This is the wife's favorite casual place.  They have great happy hour deals on both food and drink.  They are pretty close to a British Pub from a food perspective .  well, closer then a lot of other 'British Pub' want a be'.    Be warned though, they use a US pint glass when you see pint.  The large drink is a British pint.  Personally this is my only major complaint.  If you are going to call yourself a British Pub, be a British Pub.  Their menus is actually kind of reflective of the UK.  Seems odd but they have moved away from great traditional food.  But, there are some items.  I would like to see them go with the mushy peas on the  fish and chips.  I would also like to see bangers and mash or toad in the hole.  An all day British breakfast would be awesome as well.  All of that being said, I am a fan."}
{"text":"The Pub was crazy busy when we visited.  I was a little disappointed with the way I was greeted when I walked in, asked immediately if I received a text message.   If I'd known that was how they seat people, I probably would have said yep!  LOL Instead I gave an awkward \"No?\" and they said oh ok and took my name.    When we were seated an hour later, I was confused by the kilts on the servers.  Is that normal in an English pub?  I do like the way they broke up the dining areas, however, where we sat had a very strong fry oil smell and that odor stuck to me so bad I had to shower the second we got home.  Our appetizers were amazing, the shrimp and the fried pickles, and I crave them!  Super delicious.  I had the fried fish which was pretty good.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and it was overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"i remember when The Pub was over in the Rocky River/Lakewood area. I'd gone there on a date and was absolutely in love with it. I lived quite far away and that girl didn't make the cut and before I ever made it back The Pub there closed. I was crushed. My life was empty. I was just wandering lost in the world.  Last week a coworker pointed out that The Pub in Beachwood existed and my life was all sunshine and rainbows again. Danielle and I stopped for dinner on Saturday and it was glorious.  Danielle had southern fried chicken w/ gouda mac and cheese. She thought it was really good but was sad she had to choose between this and the fish and chips. Ultimately the gouda mac and cheese was the deciding factor. I had the bangers and mash. The sausages/bangers were mild and delicious. Not oily. Just wonderful. The mashed potatoes were mashed potatoes. You either like them or you don't and I love them. I'll admit i don't much care for the frozen peas and carrots but then again I don't like frozen vegetables in general. I probably would have preferred something like mushy peas. I also had a cup of cream of asparagus soup. i wasn't sure I'd actually like it but it was delicious.  I just wonder how much money we'll be wasting on fuel to get to Beachwood every weekend now."}
{"text":"Food was great!  My husband, our daughter and I were there for an early dinner this past Saturday. It was a nice atmosphere, very clean and spacious. We both ate cheeseburgers on a pretzel bun...soooo good.  Our daughter had the chicken nuggets, which we got to sneak a few, those were really tasty too. Service was great. We really enjoyed and will be back!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, clean and inviting atmosphere, good beer and food, a compete gem when you remember it's attached to a mall. Great place for guys to waste a couple hours in, I highly suggest stopping by!"}
{"text":"I met my friend there for something to eat before we went to a charity event. When we first walked in we were not greeted by the 3 hostess they had. Finally I said hello and I did receive a hello back...but that's it- no 'how are you' OR 'how many'. I decided to just say there's just 2 of us and finally we saw some movement from these 3 ladies. I've been a hostess at a restaurant before and how they acted was not professional and did not make me feel very welcomed.   Besides the horrible hostessing we had, I did enjoy our server and the food (we only had the pub pretzels and salads with happy hour wine & beer).The server gets these 3 stars from me.  I hope when I visit again there will be a better greeting. My friend says that this isn't unusual for the hostesses to be like that either- yikes! Hopefully this improves!"}
{"text":"Fish and chips were good- maybe a little bit on the greasy side but not too bad. Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  We did several appetizers and enjoyed them all.  The flatbread was outstanding.  Great beer selection too."}
{"text":"We tried this after finding it on Yelp.    I had the Young's BBQ burger, and my friend had the Bellhaven burger.  First, they have multiple burger choices (even lamb!).  Our burgers were of excellent quality, meat wise, and were grilled perfectly.  The sides (regular fries and sweet potato fries) were delicious.    Happy hour specials were very nice, including a 3 Olives vodka special for $4.  Excellent.  Server was extremely attentive, and friendly.  We really enjoyed her.    Atmosphere was pretty cool.  The patio (even though it faced the parking lot), was also pretty cool looking.    When we walked in from the parking lot, it was difficult to figure out where the hostess stand was, but we got it.  All the staff members were friendly.    My only complaint?  It's at the mall.  But, that's it.  (Yeah, I pretty much hate malls.)    We will return."}
{"text":"This place was great! My husband and I stopped here on Valentines Day and immediately found a spot at the bar. Great food, great service, great price. It's enjoyable for people of all ages!"}
{"text":"Spent a couple of hours there last night for the happy hour.  There are drink and food specials until 7 pm.  My husband is a big fan of their beer and tried a couple.  I had a mojitio and it was delicious!  We also split a few appetizers -- the pub sliders, pub wings, pretzels and mustard and loaded french fries.  The fries and pretzels were on special ($3.95 each) and were a great deal.  The pub sliders and wings were not on special but were a good deal for the quantity.  All in all, it was plenty of food for the two of us.  Our bill was just under $40 for the food and drinks.  Not too bad but a little pricey if you're looking for a cheap happy hours.   It was a beautiful night so we sat on the patio.  The servers were very attentive and took care of us when my husband complained about his first beer tasting flat.  They immediately replaced it with another kind, looked into the problem and then offered him another complementary beer when they fixed the problem.    I'm sure we'll be back again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, They have the best LAMB BURGERS in town! Enjoyable place and friendly staff.."}
{"text":"We waited a while for food... but it was good! I can only speak for the burger and fries/crisps. This is a nice spot to stop by at if you need a good meal after shopping all day. Note - this is in the Beachwood Mall... entrance both from outdoors and in the mall. TVs everywhere so if you want to watch a game, not a bad place to go. Overall satisfied and recommended."}
{"text":"This was an unexpected pleasure. We had expected more of a chain restaurant approach but were greeted with a much more independent vibe. The food was good with a nice variety and the beer selection was excellent. The staff was extremely warm, informed and accommodating. We're definitely planning additional trips here!"}
{"text":"3 words: Goat Cheese Dip.  I dream about it sometimes! Bowl of cheesy goodness with a dollop of marinara sauce and almonds. Yum.   You do know the kind of days when nothing seems to go your way? Being right across the street from us made The Pub our obvious choice for \"cheer up beer up\" outings on evenings that follow such days.... and up til now, it has never failed to cheer me up. Or is it the Sephora right next to it? Well, the combination I guess...but it works.   There is always something going on.... Trivia night, ball games, half off wine evenings... fun.  Beer is great ( obviously), cocktails are unexpectedly well made (for a beer pub), and staff is always happy and helping. Ambiance is perfect: intimate enough to have long conversations, but at the same time, crowded enough to be \"happening\". Love it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with really good homemade food. Presentation is clean and appatizing. The wait staff are dressed well and shirt / pants pressed not wrinkled and upkept. The kitchen (yes I always look if I can) was clean! The floor is clean and the stainless is shinny. Saw a chef washing hands every couple minutes between cooking and dealing with uncooked food as he ran back and forth.  Very impressed with this."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and a wide variety! To choose from.  Prices good for the food quality.  I would have rated a 5 except I expected more prompt service."}
{"text":"Decent appetizer burger selection but just OK quality. Fun atmosphere especially during a big game. All ages feel comfortable I imagine."}
{"text":"An amazing beer selection and they have Hoegaarden on draft!  Food and service was delicious! Visiting and i am going to miss this place, please build one around St. Petersburg, fl."}
{"text":"The Pub took me right back over the pond! Brought my parents back to enjoy the atmosphere too. Food, beer, service, even samples of a beer my dad was inquiring about...FANTASTIC! And salads and turkey burgers available for those watching their calories.  A welcome addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Don't really understand this place.  The first time my husband and I went here we had a pretty good experience.  Our server was nice and attentive, the appetizer was delicious (pub spring rolls), and our entrees were very good (I got the turkey rachel).  So we decided to return a couple months later, only to have a completely different experience.  I'm very understanding of servers b/c my husband and I used to work in the industry, we know that some days just don't go well, it can be busy, etc.  But our server just seemed annoyed to be waiting on us and rarely came to the table.  It took 15 minutes to get our waters and beers, and then we never again got a water refill.  Also our entrees were not good at all.  My ham and swiss pub pretzel came with a salad, and it was obvious the lettuce came from Costco and had barely anything else on it, and the dressing tasted like grocery store bought bottled italian.  The cooked vegetables that came with my husbands meal were those cubed carrots with peas that you would find in the frozen foods section, and his mashed potatoes were obviously powdered mashed potatoes out of a box.  The whole meal was just... meh.  Which is very disappointing to us, since the restaurant has so much potential and the decorations are very unique and cool.  These are $9-$13 meals and I would say the quality was no where near worth it.  After our first visit to The Pub Beachwood my husband and I really wondered why when he talked with his co-workers the following week they were surprised with our good experience and mentioned how they weren't impressed when they went.  Now we know.  This restaurant is very sporadic.  We have a theory that the quality of your meal depends on what you get, and also you don't order anything with vegetables.   Stick with the appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, and fries if you want to have a decent meal.  We may come back and order the same thing we got our first visit to see how it is.  But we'll see if we want to brave it."}
{"text":"We stopped in this place to take a break all the ladies were doing their. christmas shopping. Have a great selection of irish and english beer you cannot find state side. I'm usually a Guinness or Boddingtons pale ale man, hello tonight I saw that they had wells bitters on tap. I asked the bartender 2 if I could sample the bitters. She asked me why do you want to sample the bitters? My friend that was with had never tried wells letters before so he wanted to taste it to see if he would like it.  She grabbed the bottle of Angostura bitters and said I don't think you will like this but OK. I thought \"Oh sweetie you really should learn your product a little bit better\".   After I pointed out the tap she was standing right in front of it said wells bitters she giggled and proceeded to pour us some.  we all make mistakes.  The beer was awesome and I don't know of any other place in Cleveland where you can get true English ales and bitters. All of the servers including the male servers were dressed in kilts. I think it was a little bit on the cheesy side, because they did not need to model themselves after the Tilted Kilt. The place can stand on its own very well all by itself. All that aside we did have an appetizer and a couple beers and it was a place that I would go back to again.  ***********  Update; my preference with the kilt will not stop me from returning, but what wowed me was that the manager contacted me to acknowledge my feedback and I thought that was solid.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"They already had me at the moment I noticed that all the servers were wearing authentic kilts, and all that was lacking was a bagpipe. But expect no somber tunes, service was very friendly and attentive.  The fish and chips were classically prepared. But I was impressed they had healthy non-deep fried offerings such as grilled salmon, which was cooked perfectly (medium, my preference). In that dish, it was the side of broccoli that I was impressed with, which was grilled and seasoned to crunchy, flavorful perfection. I'll be back. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Your bartender, Ashley, needs to move on from the service industry. She was clearly unhappy to be at work; talk about floor-inappropriate conversations!"}
{"text":"We were here today (6/18/15) with another couple and we were all disappointed.  We've been to several other pubs in the area and this was just so-so.  Not as good as Sully's in Medina.  I had the bangers and mash and being British expected really good sausage.  This was kind of tasteless and the mashed potatoes supposedly had chives in it but you couldn't prove it by me.  My husband had the fish and chips and was looking forward to good haddock.  He said it wasn't as good as the pollock he's had at other places.  The service was good and we weren't rushed at all but we won't be coming back and don't recommend it.  The place itself  is very nice and reminded me of pubs I've been to in the U.K."}
{"text":"The Chicken Rachel sandwich is delicious! Insanely delicious! Turkey, cole slaw, 1000 Island dressing, swiss cheese on a toased focaccia. Buffalo Chicken Sliders were more like mini bites; weren't the greatest however it was ordered uner the impression of them being happy hour priced. Not worth $8 bucks in my opinion.  My server wasn't all that to be honest; I came in on a Saturday and she told me it was happy hour. It clearly states in the menu that it runs M-F however she was sure of it. After I ordered \"happy hour\" eleigible items she then comes back to correct herself. I then place my order and she literally blacks out and forgets what I ordered, moments after I ordered it.  The atmosphere is pretty cool. Even if it gets packed, they have turned typical standing areas into seated sections which is nice.Not a bad place to come catch a sporting event."}
{"text":"Nothing out of the ordinary for this Pub. Nice gimmick with the kilts, and a nice tour of beers with it's own passport. Nothing new there, but a nice little motivator to keep going for beer lovers. The rating is based on the atmosphere I experienced. I did not have any food and did not venture too deep in their sea of spirits. But it's around the corner, so I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have dinner at the pub a few times now (and more at other locations that have since closed) and I have enjoyed my experience each time. The food is decent and the service has been pretty good.  Today we went for lunch and arrived at around 11:45. We were seated immediately and the place was relatively empty.  Everyone was nice and helpful. They checked in on us to make sure we were okay. Jade is the only name I remember, sorry!, but they were all good and helpful.  I enjoy the Pub and I would return in the future.  Food: -Fish Sandwich: Tasty! Came with chips that i smothered in ketchup. -Caesar Salad: I did not taste it but my fiance enjoyed it. Portion is small so i recommend adding chicken or something if you're more hungry than 'snack-sized' portions would provide for.  Drink: -Coffee -Orange Juice -Waters  Other: -Bathrooms were nice and very clean."}
{"text":"I first visited the Pub in its first week after opening.  My expectation is that there would be glitches in service.  My family had visited other locations in the chain and had liked the experience.  Given that background, I arrived with an open mind seeking a new experience. Upon arrival at Beachwood Place, you first notice free valet parking.  Very nice in the winter, and during busy shopping days.  Inside, it has the appearance of a British Pub, with the heavy woodwork and central bar.  The greeters were friendly.  There is a drink/happy hour/dessert menu, as well as a regular menu.  Happy hour runs from 5 until 7 PM with selected appetizers and special sized drinks at reduced prices.  The menu has some standard pub items as well as special items inspired by the British Pub motif.  The fried pickles were great, spears not chips.  Lightly breaded and crisp.  If you order anything, order the scottish egg appetizer.  It is unique and tastes far better than it sounds.  It is a hard boiled egg, wrapped in sausage and coated with parmesan breading.  Awesome! We had two of the classic menu items. The fish and chips were great.  Lightly breaded and fried haddock. Fresh tartar sauce. Chips and cole slaw.  Huge portion and flavorful. The shepherd's pie was amazing.  It comes with a side salad.  The pie itself was warm and flavorful.  The balance of flavors between the ground meat and lamb were spot on.  Certainly not greasy.  Difficult to stop eating. If you have room for dessert and are not allergic to chocalate you must order the glenmorangie pot de creme.  It is sin in a jar.  Tasty chocolate with 10 year scotch.  Heaven. The bar has a nice selection of draft and bottled beers, both domestic and international.  Nice selection of mixed drinks and wines as well. So why does a pub like this deserve 5 stars?  There are many pubs, both local and parts of chains.  They have similar menu items, with occasional signature items.  This one exceeds expectation in execution.  While there are fried items, they are fresh, lightly breaded and not heavy or greasy.  Food was seasoned appropriately, not heavily.  Service was spot on.  Attentive and friendly.  Prices were perhaps slightly more than some similar venues, but not terribly so.  Overall, I strongly recommend this place based upon first impresion."}
{"text":"Average food but the interior of the restaurant is surprisingly impressive. I've been to London several times so I didn't have high expectations for this place. I got the Shepherd's pie which was okay. My boyfriend's lamb burger was definitely better and I was jealous. Might come back for a drink but I'll pass on the food."}
{"text":"We had a delicious lunch today.  Having joined the Pub Club we were entitled to a free appetizer and chose a wonderful flatbread.  Our server, Miranda, was a delight and dining on the patio added a final touch.  I will be back, frequently."}
{"text":"Visiting from New Jersey. Undersigned is an ex-patriate Brit, wife is from Ohio. This was a surprise. We initially just went into to look around, went and did some shopping, and then decided to come back and eat. Impressed by the overall decor - real effort to create a pub atmosphere. If you want to be picky, ceiling is a bit high, losing that cosy medieval atmosphere of many period English pubs, but otherwise full marks for effort and attention to detail. Waiters in kilts may be OTT (do they travel to work in those things ?)  We were served by Jeremy (I think - T3 on our bill). Very knowledgeable about beer and communciated his enthusiasm. We started with a hoppy Fathead session beer. My wife continued with a Twisted Thistle Scottish Ale, while I had a cask conditioned Great Lakes Commodore Perry. All excellent. I appreciated having the cask conditioned beer served at around 50 degrees, the warmer temperature allowing the full taste of the beer to come through. My wife had a turkey burger - moist and delicious, with cranberry chutney on the side. I had the bangers and mash - a hard dish to excel at, but sausages were the best I have tasted in a while, well accompanied by herbed mash potatoes and onion gravy, together with a small salad. Altogether an unexpectedly rewarding visit. I think if we lived here this could become my local. I would never have thought that I would say that about a pub located in a mall. Who knows what an authentic British Pub is like these days - so much has changed since they did away with licensing hours in the UK and stood the pub economic model on its head. But I would have to say that this is one of the best tries I have come across.  Should mention that they also have a \"serve yourself \" bar where  you pull your own taps ! Sounds a little gimmicky, but if it leads to more people coming to understand what really good beer tastes like I am all in favor."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for appetizers and drinks,  but last night was the first time I ordered dinner and it was delicious.  I had the fish and chips,  which you'd expect to be tasty at a pub. I was still impressed.  The portion was more than enough for the price and if I'd ordered an appetizer, I doubt I could've finished more than 1/3 of the dinner entree.  Service was quick for a Friday night. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The first time I went to happy hour at the Pub was with a friend.  We had pretty good service and beers at the bar with the male bartender, he was knowledgeable, to the point, friendly and prompt.  A downfall at that visit was the female bartender, aside from the fact that she looks too young to serve alcohol, she didn't acknowledge us when we sat down at the bar, she didn't greet us, she didn't even look our way, we had to wait a while, flag her down and ask for the check, and she didn't even do that fast enough.  I think her specialty was chatting up single men at the bar act as eye candy and exchange bimbo talk.   The second time I went to lunch with my boyfriend on a Saturday around 1pm.  We were seated promptly, and we waited, and waited, and waited... servers greeted and checked on other tables around us and manager walked past us, several times... and we waited... for 7 minutes to be exact before a manger actually came up and ask if anyone got our drink order.  He apologized and got our waters.    Finally the server showed up asking \"can I get your drink order?\"  Offering no apologies or conversations of any sorts.   I said, \"no, your manager got it, but you can take our food order.\" As the manager brought our waters, he asked if we wanted any appetizers on the house, and we said no, because we didn't want anything on the menu...  I ordered the shepherd's pie and my boyfriend ordered the combo fish and chips (shrimp and haddock) and a Scottish beer... In my opinion, the food was overpriced and the beer was ok.  The fries were overly salty and the fish was about 4 oz BREADED and 3 shrimp on the plate.  The shepherd's pie was ehhh... bland and mushy, the portion size was fine with a small side salad that it comes with, the dressing was perhaps the only redeeming part.  Back to the server... Not sure if I intimidated him, but he checked in on other tables around us, several times before he came to our table.  We had our food for about 13 minutes and we were half way done at this point.  I had to ask for a glass of water/refill with an empty glass.  He didn't offer another beer nor desserts.  we asked for the check and waited and waited... not as long as the water, but nonetheless, we waited... If you were a server before, you've already spotted several server no-no's...   Main take-away... Mediocrity at its best.  Overall, they were not horrifying experiences, but as the rating says... \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Ugh this place is so corporate. The service was friendly but bad. Its not busy the time I visit yet the server forgot part of my order. The worst part is she didn't check on us until it was time to go so I couldn't even ask about my order. Water was never refilled. The drink runner spilled my beer on my table. The menu didn't appeal to me so I cannot fathom why I would bother coming back."}
{"text":"I went to The Pub for one reason, and one reason only - to play bar trivia. It's held every Monday at 7:30 pm throughout the whole restaurant. There are two rounds - one is general trivia and the next is music related. As an added bonus, they throw in a lightning round where you can win a bonus prize. During the game they also hand out raffle tickets and a select few walk away with some neat bar swag. Someone at my table won a prize and got a bag, a hat, a nice polo shirt, and some other misc. stuff.   The first week we played, we were the champions and walked away with a $50 gift certificate to The Pub. We were shocked. My loyal trivia companions and I have played at many places around town and normally win piddly prizes. But a $50 certificate is pretty legit. The next week we went back and won $60 - $50 for being the overall winner and $10 for winning the lightning round. Not bad for a little over an hour's work.  My beer drinking friends were impressed by the pour your own beer wall. If you select this option, you get a card to scan at the beer wall and can select up to 40 ounces of a variety of beers throughout the night. I was impressed that the kitchen was able to veganize a black bean hummus sandwich for me.   I hope to go back for happy hour since there are tons of veg friendly options under $4.00. (there's a separate menu for happy hour that's not available at all times)  Definitely worth checking out if you're trapped at Beachwood Place and desperately need a beer or if you're a trivia geek."}
{"text":"Sadly, The Pub in Rocky River closed quite awhile ago and I have been craving their fish and chips since. I have tried other restaurants and it was ok but when I heard there was The Pub in Beachwood, I had to visit and get the famous fish and chips. My husband and I were sadly disappointed. It tasted like any other restaurants fish and chips. The Rocky River Pub used to have this beer batter that was utterly amazing! The breading was bursting with flavor and crispiness. Maybe it was their chef? I don't know. But our bill came to $50 (after tip, plus our daughter's slider meal) and I wished we had stayed home for that amount of money. On the plus side, the other half of our party got some pasta dish and a Bellhaven burger and were quite happy with it. The food was good, it just wasn't what we were expecting :("}
{"text":"Good bar type food with virtually no choices for those wanting to eat \"healthy.\"  No expense has been spared recreating a typical English pub, including furnishing it with British made tables, etc.  The service was terrific.  Our server, Rebecca, was a delight.  We will return, but not as frequently as we would if the menu were more creative and health oriented."}
{"text":"Blegh. I'm shocked at this rating. The Pub was unimpressive. Food was bland, service was mediocre. Nothing on the menu stuck out to me as something to try, so I ended up with a welsh dip pub pretzel. You know how cheese gets kinda hard, kinda smooshy, kinda greasy after it's only half way melted? That was my cheese. The prime rib in the sandwich was dry as well.   I went here for a work party, so unfortunately I did not try other dishes that my friends ordered. So, my entire review is based off of my drink and sandwich order."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this type of food but when i have eaten here the food has been decent. My most recent trip was just for a beer. Arrived around 830 and the waiter was great.. He noticed after we sat down the table needed to be cleaned and did that right away. Place was dead and it still took almost 10 minutes to get 2 beers. The food my friend ordered to go came out fast though."}
{"text":"Nice selection of craft beers on tap, many from Scotland, Ireland, and Great Britain.  They also have a variety of US craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"When we found this place we weren't expecting to be blown away... just wanted some decent bar food.  I am happy to say we were pleasantly surprised for a number of reasons.  1) The menu was gigantic and diverse.  We ordered fried pickles, a flatbread, some wings, and sandwich.  Everything was phenomenal.  Good portions and it all tasted great.  2) The beer list is huge and has so much to choose from.  Beer is brought with the bottle and the glass if it's not on draft.  Gotta love the little things.  3) Lastly, and this is the biggest reason for the 5 stars, was the small little things that our server, Kyle, did throughout our visit.  For instance, when he greeted us he had the beer menus in hand, we didn't have to ask.  While we were looking at the menu, he just brought us our water without us having to ask.  When we got to the bottom of our glasses he was next to the table asking if we would like another.  Go check this place out.. you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible female bartender supposedly the \"best\" bar tender. Manager was nice at first then roller her eyes when we asked for more drinks. Over 100 dollar tab for food and drinks and treated like 2nd class citizens.   Bartender had an attitude.   Not that busy but \"so swamped\".  Drinks made wrong!"}
{"text":"I really like the food and the beer selection. They also have 50% off bottle of wine deals every week. Every time we come over to hang out the food is being cooked and served fast and our glasses of beer are never empty. The place is good for small and large groups, they have plenty of space in the back behind the bar."}
{"text":"Lex is the best bartender I have had. Very great service. Rumor has it she is due for a promotion and is very deserving."}
{"text":"Had a chance to drop into the pub on Tuesday for a quick lunch. Had the lamb burger and a beer, but was very excited by the drinks menu, the number and quality of beers plus scotches that they had available.  I was so impressed that we returned on Saturday with seven of our best friends. They don't take reservations or call ahead seating, but Don the bar manager, worked well with us to meet our needs And when the other seven showed up our table of nine was ready to go. Thanks Don  One of our friends is from Britain, and he loved the place, the beer, the atmosphere, the waitstaff, and of course the food. Actually we all had a wonderful evening and I will be a regular at this new restaurant bar in beautiful Beachwood"}
{"text":"Went in here again and specify asked for extra crispy wings and still they weren't crispy--ugh.   Ordered the fish and shrimp combo and hardly got any fish. It did taste pretty good.   The pub burger was tasteless and not that hot.   Cookie and ice cream dessert was the best part.   Service is friendly but the kitchen is really slow. I give up on this place."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here on a Thursday night recently. We were seated right away, served right away and it was quick. The server was very friendly and it had a great atmosphere. I can't wait to go back! The burgers were great and I recommend their fries too."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Food is decent. The shepherds pie was excellent, calamari was a bit salty, and beer selection was good. Love the British options on both beverage and food menus. Its clearly a PUB so healthy food really should not be expected lol. Great place to grab a pint with the mates or a fun touristy dinner out. Seats are bit cumbersome so if there is a small child or elderly person in your group i would be sure to ask for an easier table than their lounge style tables."}
{"text":"Here we go...  It took 3 different employees and 15 minutes to be seated, when the place was slooooow. -1  The it took another 10 minutes for James to come to the table to get our drink and app order. -1  He forgot do ring the beers and we never got them. -1  They apps came out speedy and were great!!  We had 3 burgers and a wrap, Our 3 medium well burgers all came out rare - James had no idea how to fix this issue - He offered to put them back on the grill, Ha  -2  This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in my life - I am not mad at James the server - Its the management team that needs to be 86'd for not properly training the staff. I wish there was a negative star option.  Do not waste your time. Getgo is a better option, seeing as thats where we went to get food after this place failed us."}
{"text":"I dined at the Pub solo and that always makes me nervous. Many servers don't offer good customer service to single diners because obviously the bill and tip are smaller. That couldn't be farther from the truth here!  I was greeted immediately upon walking in the door. My server stopped at the table just moments after I sat down. I wish I could remember her name, because she was friendly, efficient and helpful. We chatted for a moment because I was torn between a Cuban sandwich or the Fish and Chips.  I took her recommendation and I'm so glad I did. The fish filet was huge. I mean... 'YUGE' ... in my best Donald Trump impersonation. The fish was tender and flaky encased in a perfect golden crust. Tartar sauce was great and I enjoyed the coleslaw too. I don't eat French fries much anymore because I find them boring, but these fries were so good.   During my stay, the bartender and a manager also checked in on me a few times. It was a great experience. I almost forgot to mention the décor!  It was quite beautiful in the Pub- with a tall, dark bar, high ceilings, ornate light fixtures and lots of pretty things to look at.  Next time I'm on the east side, I'm going back for that Cuban sandwich..."}
{"text":"I have now been here a couple times, always just for a quick beverage before shopping. While service is lovely, this has got to be the most awkward and uncomfortable bar situation."}
{"text":"After our bad experience the first time, the management wanted to make it right. And right they did! We came in on half off wine night- what a great surprise! We picked a good Chardonnay and ordered a few appetizers, including the cheese dip and a salad. The cheese dip was good and spicy and the pretzels that came with it were so warm and tasty! I only wish there was an option to get the cheese dip hot.   We also ordered the Shepard's pie- it was a nice balance of meat and potatoes and vegetables .  Next time I will ask for some of that gravy on the side. And yes, there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The service is always awesome and the food is delicious.  I always get either the Shepards pie or the welsh pretzel.   I've been here about 4 or 5 times and each time I left very happy."}
{"text":"I really really really enjoyed our lunch here!! First off our server/bartender Jeremy was awesome!!! We ordered the fried pickles and the ahi tuna tacos and they were soooo yummy!! I've had a ton of fried pickles that are not the spears and it made a huge difference eating the spears instead of the tiny slices.. Everything on the menu looked so yummy I wanted to order it all! They had a great wine selection and I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"2nd time our family chose to come to The Pub for our family book club.  So accommodating with size of party. Great recommendations."}
{"text":"The wings are incredible. The bar service was wonderful.  And finally the chance to try macallan 25 is well worth it!   Our bartender was extremely knowledgeable and created a wonderful dining experience.  Even if it was as simple as wings and alcohol, that's sometimes all you need.  The bar area really is decked out well and the ambiance top notch worthy of beachwood!"}
