{"text":"Poke, where have you been all my life? I was thrilled to see that a poke place had opened in the Gilbert/Queen Creek area and even more thrilled when I ordered my first bowl and tasted the deliciousness. I'm a huge sushi lover but I think I now prefer the bowl style as more filling, generous with the fish, and can be totally customized. 

My magic recipe is salmon, tuna, and yellowtail (for a rainbow roll effect) with spicy yuzu citrus and furikake, topped with all the greens, avocado, sriracha, and eel sauce. SO healthy and so yummy that I think I could eat here every day. (Confession: already been here 4 times in the last 2 weeks.)

Poki Point itself is very clean, everything fresh, and casual vibe. Staff is friendly and helpful for poke newbies like myself. And they have a rewards stamp card, which I can see myself filling up in short order!"}
{"text":"Was not disappointed. Got a bowl with tuna and octopus. Everything was fresh and tasted great. Will go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place today with my cousin. The poke was good. The atmosphere was nice and clean. The service was prompt. The only thing is that the portion was very small for the price. I expected a little more than what I got. If I am craving poke, I would go here, but not all the time. I'll have to substitute for chipotle, at least it was $5 cheaper and you get more for your money. If it was priced lower, I would come more often."}
{"text":"This place just opened and it's less than 5 minutes from where I live! It's so hard to find a poke place here in AZ. So I was pretty excited to find out about Poki Point. I ordered a regular tuna bowl with white rice. IT WAS SOOOOOO GOOD! Definitely not going to be my last time here."}
{"text":"Great place to satisfy my poki fix.  Friendly staff.  Been here several times for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"WOW... Perfect simple & delicious I went for the Big bowl salmon & tuna & all the add-on u want"}
{"text":"In comparing this place to Ahipoke (Tempe-5 stars) and Poketrition (Chandler- my favorite-5 stars), I thought it was good/ok.. The place was clean and the employees seemed friendly.  I got the regular bowl with tuna and salmon, it was good, nothing great.  I prefer the toppings at the other poke places I have tried, like watermelon radishes and fresh mango. Here they had corn and pineapple (not sure if pineapple was fresh pineapple or canned, but didn't look appealing to me).  The plastic bowl itself was too small so you couldn't mix everything up.  The portion size itself is much smaller than Ahipoke and Poketrition for their price.  It's the only poke bowl place in Gilbert right now, so if you feel like poke and don't want to drive, it's fine."}
{"text":"Went twice this week and want to go again.  Food is fresh and a great variety of flavors.  I highly recommend their house sauce.  So glad this place opened close to home."}
{"text":"Really excited to have this place nearby! Their food was fresh, my husband and I both enjoyed their fish and fun bowls. Even my young kids were able to find something there that they liked too (no kids menu, but we made it work). We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came from EOS fitness next door & saw their 'Grand Opening' banner, naturally I was curious & decided to try this place out. Walked in & was immediately greeted by friendly staff. Ordered regular bowl--half mixed greens & half brown rice with shrimp & scallops as my protein. Took advantage of unlimited toppings & pretty much added most things on lol. Went with their house sauce to top everything off, but be warned that it's a tad bit spicy, not too bad but if you're sensitive to spicy food like me, then you'll definitely notice. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is my new go to sushi spot! It's so yummy and I get to build my very own bowl. I've gone a few times and the employees are friendly and helpful. In addition, I had to call for a menu because my baby just fell asleep and I didn't want to wake her up. The employee Arlinda kindly brought me a menu, I ordered over the phone and she brought me my food. Thank you so so much!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. We have been waiting for a Poke restaurant in Gilbert for awhile now. Poki Point delivers. Great food, many options, and friendly service. We went for lunch for their grand opening offer. We were so impressed, we went back for dinner. Will definitely be going again very soon. Maybe even tomorrow."}
{"text":"Poke point was really good! I had the marinated tuna and it was yummy! I had it on salad with house sauce and spicy mayo, I thought it was really good! My daughter had the chicken and my niece had shrimp! They loved poki point! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times and  have loved it.  If they keep up the quality, cleanliness, and customer service they will be very successful.  The one thing the last time I was there there that was rather annoying especially since it was my birthday was that both my husband and I wasted avocado on our bowls and they did not have anymore prepared on Friday night ready for customer and we would have had to wait 10 minutes which lets be be for real by the size of the container it would have been longer then 10 minutes which goes back to why are you not top of your food prep when all your food is RAW!  Still love the poke though.  I just prepare myself that they will not have all the yummy stuff I love and when they do it's a bonus.  But to be truly honest the only issue I have ever had was the avocado and they had it it was just not prepared. The fish is always fresh!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome and has a very cool concept. The food was fresh and delicious. I got a large bowl over fresh greens. The spicy crab is a great choice with the eel sauce mixed in at the end. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday and it was absolutely delicious. The prices were reasonable and the tuna and salmon were very fresh. Their house sauce was excellent and the portion size was just right - left very satisfied. Bonus points for the friendly staff! Will definitely be coming back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I am so thrilled we have a Poki restaurant nearby! My friend and I came here after reading the reviews and thought to give it a try. Totally worth it! I got the regular bow (ahi & yellowtail) with the mixed greens. You can choose whatever you want! Great variety of toppings, sauces, and mix-in yummies. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Being a first timer they guided us through the process and made recommendations. It was reasonably priced too! Everything looked fresh and the Poki was delicious. It left me craving for more and a definite return in the near future. Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"Your everyday create your own poke bowl place. Lots of topping and options. A couple of the poke places I tried didn't have tofu so was happy it was an option here. Got white rice, tofu, the lemon vinegrette dressing, furakake, seaweed, cucumber, edamame, sesame seeds, and ginger. Love poke bowls, light but filling and you get grains, protein, and veggies. I liked the dressing they gave me. Wasn't sure what was vegan and was short on time so just chose the vinaigrette but they had a bunch of other sauces I would want to try. They serve soft tofu so if you don't like soft tofu out of luck there. But could just pile on the edamame and veggies. I really liked the bowl and their ingredient options, would come here again. Also like the location, high seating and not too busy."}
{"text":"Hands down best poki place around! It's super convenient, quick and it's a decent amount of food for the price. Always fresh, always friendly. Thanks everybody"}
{"text":"Late review, but I went here on the grand opening. I ordered my poke with salmon/tuna. As far as toppings go, I did the works. A variety of flavors and a good portion. The salmon was great, but the tuna was okay. As a new store, the ambiance was pretty open/plain, but the employees told me there will be several renovations. Looking forward to what they'll do.

Overall, solid experience."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price! Fresh seafood and calm, clean atmosphere. Lots of options. I will be coming here often!"}
{"text":"I love this poke restaurant!!! So many options, great bowls, and always awesome service. Best choice for a healthy, fresh, quick meal ."}
{"text":"Second time coming here. Fresh fresh seafood and chicken. The bowls are delicious and you can choose the toppings you want-- which are many. My son loves the house special sauce- I prefer good old teriyaki. My favorite is the fresh ginger toppings.  Staff is helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"This spot has become a regular dinner grab for my family during the week.  The fish is always fresh, which is really important!  The protein portions are a little small but still good for the price.  Try the marinated tuna!  It is a perfect combination with the house sauce and you will not be disappointed.  Also, I love that you can get greens mixed with rice as the base.  This variation adds a little different texture and lightens the bowl up on carbs just a bit.  

Have little mouths to feed?  All three of our children love the kids bowls!  They are filling enough for the kids without having leftovers.  

The staff is very friendly.  Every time I walk in the door I am greeted right away by a smile and a hello.  This poki spot is on point.  :)"}
{"text":"Great service and customer focus. Food is always fresh and sauces are homemade. Tons of side options and fresh toppings that go on your bowl."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for something new on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Went on Yelp and
 this came up. It was amazing! Everything so fresh and tasty. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I am so incredibly happy that this opened on my side of town. This is the BEST poke in the valley, and previously Ali Poke Bowl was my favorite. They have every topping, every type of protein, and the flavors are right on. I have so far been to every poke restaurant that has opened within a 45 min radius of me. Their prices are not any higher and it's bigger servings than other poke places too."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time
Staff is friendly and the ingredients are fresh
Very impressed with poki point
My teenager loves this place
Hope to see more of these fresh food places"}
{"text":"Seriously, great food!  Everything was delicious and the staff was so helpful for my first time.  Can't wait to go back, again and again!"}
{"text":"I have been to other Poke restaurant many many times. So when I found out this new place I definitely want to check it out.  

I went here first time and the food was pretty good, it is comparable to the other Poke places that have been popping up in the valley. The restaurant is clean and organize. It was not busy on a Sunday noon. I ordered a regular bowl with mixed greens and my usual salmon and tuna and added avocado. They gave me so little green salad. I was disappointed and was still hungry after I finished it. This would never happen to me at the other places. I am not a big eater and normally the regular bowl filled me up!

My 2 stars was based on the quantity of my food and experience I received and not over quality."}
{"text":"I tried this on a whim on my way home from an interview. My interview didn't go well and I wasn't in the mood for adventure but cooking at home seemed worse so I stopped in. WOW, I was totally surprised and really happy I came. Food was a bit on the skimpy side but tasted spectacular. I've eaten Hawaiian food of many types and many sub cultures of it as well. The Poki at this place rocked. I had the regular size with 1/2 rice 1/2 salad and scallops. Tried their house dressing and added a few other favorites and WOW did it all taste great. I was wishing I had gotten a Large instead of Regular size. I'll definitely be back to this place. Nice find for close to Chandler Heights area."}
{"text":"Pretty good idea.  Excellent quality fish and really helpful and friendly staff.  Will definitely visit again when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with many options. Just more expensive that those Poke Bowl place in Tempe"}
{"text":"A poke place near my house? Yippee! Have been impatiently waiting for Poki Point to open ever since I saw their sign as I leave the gym next door every morning! Alas, the day has come! Took my lovely daughter with me and we eagerly placed our order. A small bowl with brown rice for me and a large bowl with brown rice for her. I topped mine off with salmon and tuna in a combo of their house sauce and citrus yuzu. A scoop of spicy crab, onions, cilantro, micro greens, fried onion bits, a dash of seaweed flakes and a dollop of avocado for a $1 more. Every bite was delicious and the fish was so tender like butter! I will definitely be back again and again!


Can't get enough of this place! The staff is very friendly and of all the poke places we have been to in the valley, Poki Point gives you the biggest portions of fish! Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I sampled the Tuna and it was pale pink, mushy and had a terrible fishy taste. We left and went to our favorite in Tempe even though this one is right up the street from our house. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I love this place! Went here for the soft opening with my boyfriend and friends and the staff was very friendly and warm! I am a vegan so at first I was worried about how many options I might have but there was so much to choose from! Many sauces add ons and even tofu so I was very excited. I would definitely come back here again. Very affordable, clean aesthetic and top quality. Go and experience this wonderful establishment"}
{"text":"Fish is always fresh. I like how you can customize bowls. I wish the staff was a little friendlier. Our weekly stop for poke."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a good poki place to open near me and this one is perfect. Fresh food, good prices, so much selection, and friendly staff. They were very accommodating and even came by as I was eating to ask if I needed anything. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Poke Point today after the gym and was so happy I did! I think I may have found my absolute favorite meal ever!! Made a bowl with brown rice, tuna, salmon, green and red onion, avocado, house sauce and some crunchy toppings and I could've eaten 10x more! So delicious and a definite must for anyone who loves sushi! Great job!!"}
{"text":"Minus one star for the service we received. Two teenagers seemed irritated that we had walked in. We were not greeted. Our bowls were good. But when your service isn't great we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Truly fresh and delicious a wounderful  healthy lunch The only thing I wish they had was a rice  in seaweed roll that they have at other poki places.
To give you an understanding of what type of places it is well if you like sushi you'll love this place it's kind of like a subway you go down the line and tell them what you want in your rice or salad bowl let it be raw salmon,spicy tuna , octopus etc. Nice clean establishment."}
{"text":"Super delicious!  After having mediocre experiences at other Poki places in The Valley this place got it right!  Super fresh ingredients, tasty sauce and extremely quick in and our service make this place a winner!  Had a large bowl with everything and the kitchen sink in it.  Very fast fish, excellent sauces on a bed of fresh spring mix.  Super Yummy!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch. The poke is fresh, love that you can choose your sauce, mixtures and toppings. The staff is friendly and will guide you through picking your poke bowl. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new poke place and I came for the soft opening.  The food was fresh and delicious with more options than I am used to. Everyone was really friendly and I devoured my bowl as fast as I could. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Not a big seafood fan but the crab meat is amazing! Made me change my mind about seafood now that I've tried Poki Point"}
{"text":"I'm not really a big fan of raw seafood, but this place definitely changed my mind about it. Everything was more than enough for the portion. And it was delish! Definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"Visited this newly open business on 8/16 and have to say we fell in love with it. 

Everything was clean and ingredients were fresh.  I chose a large bowl with Ahi, salmon and marinated ahi with house sauce on a bed of greens and brown rice.  For toppings, I chose cilantro, edamame, avocado, seaweed salad and cucumbers. Topped it off with spicy mayo.    I now have dreams about this bowl!  So good!

We will be back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Really great food, staff is friendly and gives great pointers on what to order and their personal favorite mixes. I would love to come back here and I'm from Tucson about an hour and a half away."}
{"text":"We are definitely in trouble! We went back to Poke Point to grab another bowl. I foresee so many poke bowls in our future. 

So, after my last review regarding temps, I received a message from the biz and was very happy and impressed they got back to me. Mostly, they seemed to have adjusted something so that my rice did not heat my proteins and isn't hard. Way to go!

So good! I also tried the Yuzu Citrus sauce this time and it matches my palate much better! Had the regular bowl and it was perfect for lunch! Yay, I love supporting local buisnesses and we apparently love poke even more now that it's in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I walked in and took a look at the fish, and was so disappointed by the freshness that I did not even risk placing an order. I eat a lot of raw fish as sushi, sashimi, poki, and this was absolutely subpar. I would recommend looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"I haven't tried a whole lot of Poke places, but the ingredients here are fresh and the flavors are good."}
{"text":"First time as they just opened today. The food was great. Friendly staff. Clean restaurant. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So yummy! We are completely addicted. So glad they move in so close to the house; no need to cook anymore!"}
{"text":"Poki Point opened 4 days ago and I've come 2 times since then. Great Poki spot in the east valley with great fresh ingredients, a clean environment and friendly knowledgeable staff. I will definitely be a regular here and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Although Poki is not my favorite thing, I appreciate the popularity that it's gaining. This place is new and clean, and a bit slow because people don't know about it yet, so take advantage.  The bowl was masterfully assembled, and a beauty to look at. A light healthy meal, and although it's not cheap it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Hidden from view but a sight to see!
Walking in I was casually greeted by the hostess, warmly wrapped by Winehouse on the speakers, maneuvered masterfully by the simple-to-read menu, pleasantly pleased with the poke (seafood) and afterward comforted by the clean (and individual) commode. 

They have 4 static dishes, I chose 'The Point' (pic below), and a \"build your own bowl\" section to their menu. While they barely opened a few months ago, one criticism I could offer is while the drink selection was good, it's a bit limited. I'd like to see it expanded to include more imported items and lemonade style offerings IMO

The interior design is very well done, food was very good and if your particular dining partner prefers this over Chipotle, like mine did, than this may very well become one of your new favorites spots in Gilbert too."}
{"text":"Four of us were looking for a lunch spot and accidentally found Poki Point. We all had regular bowls. I had the \"Point\" which is a great mix of seafood, veggies, fruits and spices. Loved it and a lot of food! My family had chicken as the protein and they all loved it. Not as pricey as similar in the area. Friendly staff and very fresh and clean. We will be back."}
{"text":"We've been to Poki Point twice and have enjoyed it :) Nice addition to Gilbert - quick and the staff is friendly. The fish is fresh as well as the veggie choices. Would like to see the scoops of fish a little bigger for the cost - but over all we have enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the fish is fresh and the concept is outstanding. I love the fact I have a healthy choice for food right next to the gym."}
{"text":"I love restaurants that serves food that are unique to the area. My family and I went here last night. My 11 year son was not keen on the idea of having Poke for dinner,  but after eating here,  it completely changed his mind.  In fact, the next night,  my son had asked if we could go back again for dinner. We did! They have a good variety of fresh ingredients to make different combinations of poke bowls so you can change up your order everytime you visit!"}
{"text":"Place is great. Fresh tuna and yellow tail. Amazing toppings. Give it a try, like it. Very light and healthy."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend and was very satisfied. The employees behind the counter were super friendly, the restaurant was very clean and the food was delicious!  I got a salad bowl with marinated and plain tuna, spicy crab, edamame, green onion, pickled ginger, and seaweed salad. I found the tuna to be nice and fresh, no fishy smell or taste, and all the sides were just as fresh. I also felt they gave a really good amount of protein, so much in fact I didn't even finish it all and I got the smallest size. I definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"**Update 8/11/17**
So we went back and this time the fish looked a little more fresh.  I decided to go with the house sauce this time along with salmon and ahi.  Got most of the toppings but no avocado this time.  Topped it with spicy mayo.  They don't get a thumbs up for putting my bowl together but no big deal as I mix the whole thing anyway.  Maybe he was in a rush.  Anyway it was good and the serving seemed large.  I couldn't finish it so I saved it for the next day.  Still ono!!!

**Original**
Ah, good enough.  I have been to several around the valley and I from Hawaii so I have a pretty good experience with poke.

I would rank this third best I have tasted.  The other 2 are in Tempe.  Same as the others.  Rice or salad, 2 proteins, and toppings.  Extra for avocado.

I had the Salmon and Spicy Tuna with spicy mayo.  Not bad.  Portions could be bigger with the fish.  Nothing really spectacular.  One thing it has going is it is close to the house so I can calm my cravings when I need too.  My wife thought these guys were good so we probably be going back.

Prices are pretty much the same.  The other places give miso soup so that sucks they don't offer extras like that.  

To me, the one thing that these places are missing are the extra.  In Hawaii, we call it Pupus.  Having a beer and eating pupus is what these type of places need.  Offer garlic edamame, sashimi, poke by the pound, hamachi kama, and the rest of the local grinds that they call finger foods."}
{"text":"Went in today to carry out a couple of orders and this place did not disappoint.

I was very happy to find that the Value, the Selection, the Service, and the Portions were Top Notch.

This is a \"fast food\" and they do it well.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying a poki bowl and will definitely be coming back. Staff was very helpful."}
{"text":"Discovered this place last Sunday, the day after they opened. Nice bunch of people. Bowl is set up correctly, and not just stacked. I'm happy with the volume and the flavor. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The people were really nice and helpful. I loved my food, everything tasted fresh and delicious and the portions are so big! Couldn't even finish it all, I was so full! 

Would definitely recommend this poki place!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Got salmon and tuna bowl with rice. You can add SO many different things to the bowls. Make it as spicy as you want. Love that in addition to all that....you can add a scoop of spicy or regular crab meat! Woo hoo! Great customer service as well! Wish it was closer to my house!!! :("}
{"text":"As long as they keep serving tofu, I'll keep coming back. lots of vegan friendly options."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Staff was helpful in picking out what to add to my bowl and house sauce was delicious! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious.   It's like unwrapping a sushi roll.   All the flavors belong together.  The restaurant is super simple and clean. To go orders seemed popular. Excellent for a quick lunch"}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever !!! Awesome service, the server is very friendly and nice, very clean, cheap and delicious food!!!! If you sushi/sashimi lover this is the place to go !!!"}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner and luckily the place was empty.  It's setup like a Subway or Chipotle's where you can either ask for signature bowl or choose ingredients.

Most days I'm vegan so this was a rare cheat-day.

We were very overwhelmed with the options so we opted to get signature bowls.  I got the Volcano and my wife got The Point bowl.  Our daughter got a very simple bowl with rice and shrimp.

This was our very first time having poke anywhere.  We really liked it!  It was less expensive than sushi and we left full.

The place was clean, service fast and the staff was friendly.  Only reason I didn't rate it 5-Star was that the ambiance could be better. 

We are looking forward to trying out other poke places in the Gilbert area but this place has set the bar very high."}
{"text":"I stopped by to try this place since I love quite close. Bowls were pretty good, I didn't like that they put the \"toppings\" (sesame seeds,crispy onion) under the other types of toppings (seaweed salad, fruit, edamame). Was a little over priced compared to another Poke place I frequent."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, and lots of choices!  Staff was friendly, place was clean.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Poke in Gilbert!! Love the options they have here. Fresh fish, and fresh ingredients. 

I got the regular bowl (2 proteins: salmon & octopus) with a half and half base (white rice & mixed greens). For sauces I went house sauce and got almost all the sides available cause why not! Food looked as good as it tastes. 

I'd definitely recommend you check this place out! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good.  I had one of the bowls with rice.  I thought the options were good, but overall I did not feel like the quality was as good as some other places I have tried.  I went at the end of the day and I felt like it could have been fresher.  I just wondered how long some of that stuff had been sitting out."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. They have a variety of items to choose from and you get to build your own bowl. Quiet place to chill and enjoy a nice lunch. Price is around the same you would pay at chipotle or five guys (nicer fast food dining so it's a little pricey). I've gone multiple times and have always had fast great service."}
{"text":"Found a great little place that's sure to be a favorite!  Wonderfull selection and a great price."}
{"text":"I just ate here for lunch and man it's delicious. The yuzu sauce is really great with the tuna and salmon. The staff is very friendly. As a sushi lover this is one place I can get my fix. The decor is a bit barebones but I think that's because it just opened."}
{"text":"Seriously so good! My boyfriend and I drove out here from Peoria, and it was so worth it! The fish and produce are so fresh and yummy. I got three proteins in my bowl, salmon, ahi, and yellowtail, along with a ton of sides! They have gluten free soy sauce, which is a huge plus, and the spicy mayo is delicious. The owners are incredibly friendly and the management and staff were really helpful. We got back on our side of town and were already craving it again!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I went here tonight and we were absolutely blown away! The Poki was AMAZING!! Very fresh, lots of options and they give you a LOT of food! Not only that, the service was impeccable. Only thing we wish is that there was a smaller size option, we both ordered regular sizes and were absolutely stuffed! We will be back, I won't be surprised if we are here multiple times a week!!!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when my boyfriend and I found this place over on the east side because we typically drive to Ahwatukee to our usual poke place when we're craving. For being nearby, it's not too bad; however, I'd still make the drive to my fave poke spot. 

The fish was fresh, thank goodness, because having a bad experience with poke can really kill ya vibes. The salmon and spicy tuna were good, albeit being rather small portions. Avocado is chunky style (not a fan), but it was fresh. They also offer spicy crabmeat in addition to reg. crabmeat (get the spicy!). The Volcanic Bowl was solid. Lots of toppings, so consequently pretty  flavorful. Sauces were good; I recommend mixing the house with the spicy yuzu and adding spicy mayo drizzle on top. 

The reason why I wouldn't mind driving a little further for poke is not because of quality per se, but rather for the portion. While it was tasty, the portions for proteins and toppings were quite small compared to what I've received elsewhere! The serving for masago was so sad :( Additionally, I got the white rice and it was kind of hard--maybe just a bad batch.

Overall, it's a good spot for poke for the east side, but for a more decent serving size, try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to Ahipoki Bowl and learned poki bowls are okay... but then I went to Poki Point and realized I LOVE POKI Poki Point is the best poki place I have gone to and the staff is always so polite Love love love Poki Point!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good compared to some of the other poke places in the valley. We got there at 7 and there was a pretty long line but it went by pretty quick. The restaurant was clean and staff was nice. We got their large bowl and it was pretty filling and good quantity of food. I just wish the bowls were bigger to be able to mix everything together. I like the fresh toppings like cilantro, jalapeños, edemame. Their pineapples looked pretty old and brown but tasted ok. Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is SO good! I got the marinated tuna with spicy yuzu sauce on spring mix and a bunch of yummy fresh toppings with the house sauce on top. Bomb!! Everything is fresh and super flavorful! We also ordered Masubi and they made it fresh, best masubi I've ever had and we've tried it in Hawaii! We can't wait to go back, it will be very soon!!"}
