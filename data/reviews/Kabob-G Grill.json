{"text":"Amazing kabob place! Had the best tabuleh I have ever had in my life! I was skeptical because most of the time when I have had gyros they come with a yogurt-like sauce and the sauce served here is listed as sour cream, which was why I didn't order it. I did however order the swarma and kabob sandwiches, which are more like wraps, and they were great! The lamb was juicy and perfectly seasoned and the mushrooms exquisite. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've always had a love/hate relationship with Kabob-G Grill, a local Lebanese restaurant a block away from my house. I've had their food about 4 times before today and it's either been really good or horrible. In once instance it almost killed me. I choked on a chewy piece of lamb and honestly thought I was a goner. Even after that traumatic experience I decided to give them another chance. Mainly because I wanted a gyro and I was already next door at my friend's tattoo shop.

The Gyro:

Luckily for me this gyro fell into the \"really good\" category. It wasn't your normal every day gyro in the slightest. The homemade pita was really thin compared to most gyros, and about twice the size. Instead of cutting the lamb into thin strips they chopped it into small chunks. The lamb was perfectly juicy and nicely seasoned. I got at least two pieces if not more in every bite that was taken. The sauce was also a lot lighter than most gyro sauce. It had a flavor that had a hint of mint in it. Also inside the gyro was lettuce, tomatoes, and perfectly sauteed onions. My only really complaint was that the lettuce could have been fresher.

The Rating:

Was it filling?: Extremely

Did I feel gross afterwards?: Yes, it was maybe a little too filling

Would I eat it again?: Yes for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food.

Small restaurant.   Excellent food with good portions.  Love the filet kabobs dinner!

Their hummus is extremely creamy and smooth.   Wonderful by itself or with the filet on top.  The lentils and rice dish is also delicious.  Their meat grape leaves are our favorite in Pittsburgh! 

This is a family owned business and the family takes care of you.  Wonderful service.   

Don't forget the baklava! Delicious.

It is easy for take-out too.  They are closed Mondays."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Lebanese restaurant.  The family that owns it is absolutely fantastic.  You can tell that they take a lot of pride in their cooking.  The lamb shank is out of this world.  So tender and it just falls off of the bone.  The lamb chops are excellent as well.  Definitely bring your appetite because the meals come with a very large salad that has a garlic dressing that is very rich and creamy.  The left overs are just as good as when they first bring out your food.  I often order take out because of that very reason.  It is small, but just make a reservation.  They are BYOB and do not charge a corkage fee.  I'd highly recommend them to anyone that loves great food."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! We ordered grape leaves, baba ghannouj, gyro's, falafel, kibbee. The service was great and the food came out really fast. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"No other Lebanese restaurant that we have been to can compare. The food is consistently excellent.  We love the family atmosphere and support this family owned business. The scope of the menu gives all customers great selections from vegans to meat lovers. A must for all!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a HIGHLIGHT of our recent trip to Pittsburgh. Natasha guided us through the menu, entertaining us with her wit and wisdom. We had a wonderful time interacting with her; she is knowledgeable, engaging, and FUN!

The food - homemade with expertise and love - is INCREDIBLE. Don't miss the lamb, the moussaka, the salads (with grated feta!), the rice pudding and the baklava. I would drive 6 hours for another meal at this wonderful restaurant - and will definitely do so in the future.

Do not miss this gem!!"}
{"text":"Kabob is one of our (friends of ours and us) places to go in the South Hills. The salads with choices of filet mignon, lamb or chicken on top are excellent. The lamb kabob is also very good. There are a variety of other selections on the menu also. The BYOB is a nice touch. We have had many bottles of fine wine there. This is a family operation with a friendly atmosphere and it is fun to trade barbs with the high school daughter who is quick witted enough to parry any jibe. Good food with a fun atmosphere and no pretentiousness. Very casual."}
{"text":"I love this place! I sometimes eat this every friday night with my dad, being lebanese and growing up with some pretty good lebanese cooks, even he agrees its amazing! Grape leaves and salad dressing is the BEST!"}
{"text":"I love Kabob-G. I've really never had anything that I've disliked there - the house dressing is delicious, love the Tabboolee, Falfel sandwich is great, I get the vegetarian grape leaves a lot and love them too!
The waitress is funny and remembers who I am (and my boyfriend) and always knows what we want. I'm able to walk there but I can see that parking might be an issue for some people."}
{"text":"Hands down the best middle eastern food I've ever had. Highly recommend the grape leaves and falafel. Crazy amount of vegetarian choices. The Khalils are the sweetest family and Natasha is the kindest, most attentive waitress. Can't say enough nice things about this place. Perfect for any occasion. They are able to accommodate anyone. Honestly I come in here at least once a week and we rarely dine out. Love love love Kabob-G"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of the most authentic Lebanese restaurants in Pittsburgh. Being of Lebanese decent, growing up in a household with my Situ (grandma) authentic Lebanese cuisine is what I love and look forward to if I have a choice! Some must haves are the Kibbeh Nayyeh (raw), stuffed grape and cabbage leaves, Luban (yogurt),  Loobheh (green beans with tomatoes). You can't go wrong with the lamb,  it's always cooked to perfection as are the other selections previously mentioned. Open on Sunday NOW!!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. I had a sampler appetizer and everything we very tasty. The lamb kabob sandwich was particularly good. Too many times places over cook the lamb and it ends up dry but my lamb was cooked perfectly. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to others. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the interior could definitely use a renovation."}
{"text":"Shawarma Platter was my ticket for lunch on my visit here. It was my first time and thought that this should be a pretty good representation of what this place has to offer. I came in here on a Wednesday around lunch time just because I never noticed it here. The Shawarma was delicous and plentiful I almost wish that they would offer a half order and cut the price in half as well. It was a lot of food in my opinion. The host was also very friendly and answered all of my questions. The decor is a little drab but I can easily see past that. I would recommend you go check it out and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Kabob G's and it's delicious. I ordered the chicken shawarma platter and hummus and my dad ordered vegetarian grape leaves. Everything was incredible!! I've been a regular at 2 other Mediterranean places that I enjoy and they are both good but Kabob G's is my new favorite Mediterranean/Lebanese restuarant! I've tried grape leaves from multiple restaurants and stores and the ones today at Kabob G's were the best I ever had! The chicken shawarma platter and hummus was delicious! You get good sized portions for such a reasonable price. The hummus is served with warm pita bread. Kabob G's is a pretty small little restaurant located in Castle Shannon by Ice Castle and the T track. It's very nice inside and super clean! They only offer Mediterranean/lebanese food, they have no American food choices, so I wouldn't recommend to eat here if you aren't a fan of yummy ethnic food! They offer takeout as well as obviously dining in. They are open everyday except Monday's. They are open later in the evening which is nice also. Definitely will be returning to Kabob G's and I recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing ... Favorite middle Eastern place to eat hands down.. Love the lamb kabob, the rice is delicious and you gotta get hummus !"}
{"text":"Authentic unpretentious delicious middle eastern food! Attentive service! Locals eat here regularly."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the south hills and check out this place with my fianc√©. Absolutely delicious and fresh, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious there are not enough words to describe it.  I have tried so many things that I would never have eaten before & they are amazing.   The service is impeccable & I have never had one bad experience, in fact we come at least once a week because it is that good."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place in Pittsburgh.  I haven't gotten a single dish that I haven't enjoyed yet.  The Loobyeh is outstanding, so is the sleek, hummus, tabboolee, shish kabobs, and gyros.  And the grape leaves with sirloin are delicious.  My favorite dish is the Raw Kibbee which is only available on Saturdays.  At $13.00 a plate its the best deal on the planet.  I'd easily pay double for it. 

I love eating different cuisines, but if this was the only place on earth to eat I'd be more than okay with it."}
{"text":"The food here is hands down delicious. If you're looking for something tasty to try, check out the spinach and feta pie. The baked kibbee is to die for, and the lamb sandwich is always on point. It's never over cooked or chewy. I typically order mine without the hummus but add a white garlic sauce to it. The babaghanoush is sooooo good. Pretty much anything on the menu here is wonderful and cooked perfectly and with passion. Don't skip out on the lentil soup either!"}
{"text":"We just had a dinner there tonight, great meze platter, and chicken shawarma. We all left full & happy."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I usually get a mixed kabob platter with chicken and filet. The chicken is garlicky and delicious, plus super tender. The meal is served with rice and a side salad. and the salad dressing is super yummy and addictive. My mom loves the lamb shank, but  I have yet to try it."}
{"text":"I've heard such great things about Kabob-G-Grill, not only from Yelp reviews, but also from people from around the area. Therefore, I've really been wanting to try the food here. Kabob-G didn't disappoint!  The restaurant is rather small, but there weren't too many people dining-in during my visit. However, during the hour or so I was there, they probably got about 6 takeout orders. 

If you like baba, you've got to get it here. It's so smooth and creamy, I absolutely love it. The shawarma platters are also pretty good, both the chicken and steak. Perhaps the best part about the restaurant is the service, which was friendly and very quick. 

When our Mediterranean craving strikes, this is our go-to."}
{"text":"I drive by this place twice every day, but never stopped in. Then I heard that they had lamb shank on the menu, and I had to try it. Soooo good! Super tender lamb. Generous portion. Salad dressing was perfect. Ready right on time when I got there for take-out. I'd give it 5 stars, but I've only been there once. This is going to be a regular stop."}
{"text":"I can't even handle how authentic this place is. Your waitress is the daughter of the owners and she doesn't only provide excellent service but comedic entertainment. The food here is so ridiculous. I would definitely wear yoga pants because you're going to eat a lot. The salad dressing is homemade and full of garlic flavor explosions. The lamb and green beans and the lamb chops are a favorite."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for lunch at this nice small cozy restaurant. I was first pleasantly surprised when my iced tea was delivered and it was not just normal iced tea but was flavored with mint, which gave made it much more flavorful  than regular iced tea. It's a good sign when a restaurant pays attention to small details like their iced tea. 

This was a very quiet Tuesday in December but there were several other tables filled, indicating this restaurant has a following. 

The waitress was very friendly and service was good. I got the falafel sandwich. It came burrito style with the pita bread wrapped around the falafel and other ingredients. It was very flavorful and I'd order it again. 

This is definitely a nice local neighborhood restaurant I'd like to visit again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best middle eastern resturant around. Food is always fresh made to order and fantastic! 
Thank you for yet another wonderful dinner and service!  Family owned and operated resturant, they serve you same quality food they cook at home! Family cooking at its best!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Kabob-G's for the first time last week with the family, and really enjoyed lunch. The food was authentically prepared and very flavorful. We ordered the Sleet for an appetizer and I enjoyed the Moussaka for an entree. Everything was very good and served very quickly!"}
{"text":"We moved here from Southern California this past June and couldn't find a Lebanese restaurant that compared to our beloved Open Sesame. Then we heard about Kabob G's. We dined with some friends here this past Saturday and were overjoyed to find such delicious food! It comes very close to our SoCal spot.  Fantastic kabobs, hummus, rice pilaf and an appetizer called sleek. Sounds healthy with grains and greens, but how can something so healthy be so magnificent? Oh, don't forget the garlic sauce for the chicken tawook! Kabob G's is a hidden treasure. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The fattoush salad with filet mignon will change your life. I'm always pumped when  I come here. The family that owns it are so nice too. Definitely a place worth trying! BYOB too."}
{"text":"Wow, what a gem!  Family owned and friendly. Careful, the portions are LARGE. Had the mezza platter with baba, hummus, taboulie, pickles, and feta.  All excellent. Also had the felafel.  WOW! Flavorful and light.  Some of the best we've had!

Barely had enough room for my kafta platter, whoxh was also excellent.  And then the owner brought out baklava for a free dessert!!  Super good and fresh all around. Oh, and the salad dressing is killer too!

Chris"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite middle eastern restaurants in the Pittsbugh area. It's tiny with just a few tables. My wife loves their sleet. We've never had a bad dish there. The place is usually busy, but we've rarely had to wait for a table.
This is truly a family owned restaurant. The owner's daughter can be found waiting tables while other family members do the cooking. We often see our friends and neighbors there. It's that kind of place."}
{"text":"My best friend was Lebanese - so maybe I was spoiled, but I ordered 2 to go dinners-Filet kabobs and Kibbee --  filet kabob (I ordered rare) were well-well done and tough, Kibbee was not anywhere like Theresa's mother. Rice was just soggy rice and spaghetti- salad was fresh but was not served with the oil and lemon I expected,  even the pita was stale. They seem like nice people and I thought twice before I wrote this review -- maybe the grape leaves and other  Lebanese specialties are good -- but not the filet or cooked kibbee"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and good prices. The platters are well worth it. It's a family owned place which makes it that much better."}
{"text":"I have been eating this kind of food my entire life and can honestly say that this is the absolute best raw kibble (only on Saturdays), grape leaves, hummus, baba and tabouleh in the five county area bar none! Pita is always fresh and plentiful and the fresh brewed mint tea is a great accompaniment to a delicious meal you won't be leaving hungry or disappointed with!"}
{"text":"Good food, closer in taste to lebanese food than many of the restaurants around... huge sandwiches!
All in all, good."}
{"text":"Not very good. I should have walked out the minute I entered as that's what my instincts were telling me to do. Me being optimistic was nice enough to give it a try and I regret it. Major disappointment to the culture and quality of the food I was expecting. Service was really bad too. Being the only one in there I figured you might concentrate on impressing your only customer."}
{"text":"By far the best middle eastern in Pittsburgh. My boyfriend took me here on one of our first dates and I won't lie, I was skeptical because of the outside. He told me to 'trust him' which I did because I knew he had the same taste in food as me. Let me tell you...this is now our once-a-week spot. By far the most amazing middle eastern food I've had anywhere. The family who owns it is amazingly friendly and the food is phenomenal. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place was quite good. My husband and I were running errands nearby and wanted to grab a quick tasty lunch. I found this place on yelp and it led us to a very delicious lunch. The smells coming out of the back of the place definitely lured us in. It's a small cozy place on the inside, nothing too fancy. But the service is fast and pleasant. I got the banaganoush and stuffed meat grape leaves and my husband got the meat shawarma platter. Our food came out pretty quickly, which was good since we were hungry. The stuffed grape leaves melted in my mouth- yum, so delicious!! If I'm passing through that area, I would definitely make another trip here for lunch."}
{"text":"I returned to Kabob G today for takeout this time. My food was ready in 15 minutes. It was hot and just as good as when we ate at the restaurant. I give a 5/5 rating for the delicious and flavorful food which I will be enjoying again in the future! Especially the mezza platter which includes all my faves including tabbouleh, hummus and babaganoush! I maintain a 4/5 for the overall rating because of the decor. 

I highly recommend Kabob G if you like delicious authentic Lebanese cuisine!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. We had reservations for 4 and were seated right away. Very small and quirky. Door was open and a breeze was blowing in. The screech of the trolleys passing by added to the atmosphere . Food was unbelievable. Authentic middle eastern  fare. Tried the special lollipop lamb chops with Syrian rice,  salad with feta too, fantastic. Portions were huge. Tried the baklava and that was really great! Not one bad thing to say about this place and that's unusual for me, cause I'm tough to please.  Try this place. It's a gem!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots to grab take-out when hanging out at home.

The food is consistently good and the staff is always friendly and efficient on the phone and during pickup.

There are two issues I have with Kabob-G.

Recently they raised their prices. I except raises in prices as food costs rise but this was a solid several dollars on multiple meals. While Kabob-G is still affordable this was quite a shocker.

The second issue I have is with their salad. For some reason the salad is always made with multiple chinks of ice burg. Like serious chunks that you would never want in a salad. if you look past the chunks and put in the sweat equity to tear them up yourself the salad is actually quite good for a side."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Castle Shannon.  Outstanding lamb chops and Moussaka!  If you enjoy Lebanese food, this is the place to try."}
{"text":"Set back on a side street in Castle Shannon sits this little gem. This is a true family Lebanese restaurant right from mom's kitchen (honestly, that's who makes the food). You can taste the love in every dish. The baba it's outrageous with a fantastic smoky flavor. The hummus is the best around. I personally love the sleek; a perfect balance of greens, bulgar, and spices that makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The salad is made by the dressing. I'm personally not a fan of iceberg lettuce but it makes the perfect vehicle to carry the house dressing...you'll want a gallon odd dressing to take home! 

I still crave the falafel that was made by an Israeli family restaurant in Philadelphia where I went to school. Kabob-G comes the closest to that that I found in Pittsburgh. The tahini sauce is a little on the light side butt still good.

You have to try the moussaka; the best I've ever had. The kabobs are the bomb. The seasoning is perfect with just a little kick to get your mouth humming. My favorite is the lamb but the filet and chicken are also very good. You can't go wrong with any is them.

Seriously, do yourself a favor and go find this little gem. It's all about the food!"}
{"text":"Note #1: The easiest way to get here coming outbound is to cut through the Laughlin Funeral Home parking lot as you're not really allowed to make the left on Castle Shannon Boulevard onto Willow. Kabob-G Grill is hidden on a side street parallel to the trolley tracks. 

Note #2: They are a BYOB establishment. 

Kabob-G Grill offers what they call \"Authentic Lebanese Cuisine\" along with other Mediterranean favorites like grape leaves, Moussaka, and of course gyros. Not being able to locate a menu a few nights ago, we ordered in the dark, and got, you guessed it, gyros.

It's been a good 6 or 7 years since I've been to Kassab's on the South Side (so no review for now), but Kabob-G's gyros are similar to Kassab's in that you essentially get what is a cubed-lamb wrap being that the pita bread is thin and very tortilla-like. 

It's also as big as a rolled-up newspaper, but you won't want to use it to smack a dog on the ass. No, this was an Arabic dinner encapsulated into a sandwich. Again, this lamb was cubed, not shaved, which made the gyro challenging to eat (lamb chunks fallin' out). It came with the standard veggie trio of lettuce, tomato, and onion and a sauce that may or may not have been tzatziki. The pamphlet menu I procured upon picking up our order says it comes with sour cream, but in the description for their Shawarma (comes with Filet Mignon), it says that a Sesame Tahini sauce is used, and that was what I felt I was tasting. As I said earlier, it was tough to eat at times, but the gyro was so good I minded not. One thing I'll say about cubed lamb in a gyro is that you feel as if you're getting more meat than you do when the lamb is thinly sliced, and this most certainly was filling. 

The french fries that tagged along were shoestring-style and were merely blanched as opposed to fried (it's a 'Burgh thing), but the portion was generous (as was the ketchup), and overall, they were sufficient albeit average. 

Their Spinach Pie was the flyaway highlight of the meal. Tangy spinach, sweet onions, lemon, assorted spices (hey, I'm no Sherlock Holmes 'aight?), and feta cheese all bandaged, mingled together and baked in a blanket of supple, smooth dough. Each pie was big as a properly folded handkerchief and as moistly ambrosial as Paula Deen's Gooey Butter Cake sans all the calories. 

We also got Kabob-G's Mezza Platter which gets you Hummus, Pita bread, Baba Ghannouj, Tabbouleh (it's spelled differently at every turn!), Calamata Olives, Feta Cheese, and pickled veggies.

The Tabbouleh worked only as a palate-cleanser for me and nothing more as it was mostly parsley with scant bulgur wheat to be found.  I didn't get to try any of the Baba Ghannouj, but the hummus was pure manna. Smokey, nutty, creamy, sleek, I ate the remainder with a spoon after we ran out of bread along with the hefty tomato slice in the middle. See Gali's in Pleasant Hills for a similarly delightful hummus. Put the stuff in jars, and watch supermarkets fight to keep it in stock. 

Those poor chickpeas must be crushed into near-nothingness and then be crushed again...and again. The horror!

Kabob-G Grill is a nice, friendly, family-owned establishment run by nice, friendly, family-oriented people. Keep them in the black."}
{"text":"Fun place and funny waitress, who is daughter of the owners.

Good place for Mediterranean - Lebanese cuisine.  

Started with the Mazza platter, really good Hummus, Baba Ghannouj, Tabboolee, Feta cheese, Calamata olives and more.  Lebanese salad was good, the house dressing made the salad.  The Shish Kabob came with lamb that was cooked perfectly and came with rich pilaf that was flavorfull.

Noticed a few take out orders while we were dining.  This is a small place and they do take reservations.  A few couples coming in and they were told it would be one hour wait.  One couple came back...the other, not sure if they decided to come back or chose to go somewhere else.

BYOB."}
{"text":"Excellent! Got take out this evening.....a gyro platter, lamb kabob sandwich, mujadarra, grape leaves and spinach pie.....everything was amazing and had such great flavor, I can't wait to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Small and appears to be family owned. Fair prices with generally very good food and generous portions.

The moussaka was a treat as were the hummus, baba, and sleek. This is BYOB.

I did not, however, care for the house salad dressing. I was expecting an olive oil/lemon based dressing but this was creamy and didn't appeal to me. However, to be objective about it, mayo is one of only my few food dislikes so I am biased.

All-in-all though this was very good and a nice change from Aladdin's."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but my first choice for Mediterranean type food in the Pgh. area. Absolutely best I've eaten."}
{"text":"Outstanding Mediterranean food. Go for the fabulous food, NOT the decor and atmosphere. Generous potions. Hummus is delicious. Falafels are as good as in Israel. Lamb dishes are amazing.
Salads are always fresh and delicious. Iced mint tea is refreshing. Save room for rice pudding made with a touch of rose water, best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The family that owns it is so nice and the daughter that waits on my husband and I every time we are there is wonderful.  The raw kibbe is great and the soups are beyond amazing! We literally feel like we are family when we come to this place! We literally go so much that the waitress knows us and our order by heart."}
{"text":"My wife & I went their today on a recommendation from a friend. Small little gem in our big city. Wow what GREAT food. The hummus was delicious, the salad was very tasteful,  gyro platter & stuffed grape leaves excellent.  Nice people also.   Will definitely be going back to try more fabulous food.  It's a small place so call ahead to check on sitting availability."}
{"text":"Solid food that is well priced for want you get! This place is BYOB which is nice. A lot of different things on the menu"}
{"text":"My fianc√©e is a vegetarian, so sometimes it can be difficult to find a restaurant that provides her with options.  Kabob-G had many options for both vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Started with a couple bowls of spinach and lentil soup with lemon. I ate mine so fast, it was so fresh and delicious. Then came the fresh, thin pita. I've never had pita this good. Perfectly warm and soft. Spinach pie for my fianc√©e followed. The dough was like a pillow and she loved the filling. She wished for more feta inside but it was still fantastic. Then came the falafel platter and my lamb kabob. Falafel were unique. They looked like mini donuts. Crispy exterior with a soft and well seasoned interior. A delicious array of pickled veg, tomatoes and lettuce with a flavorful tahini sauce to go with it. Just wonderful. My lamb kabob was so tender and juicy, bursting with flavor. I found myself longing for more, bite after bite. The warm, pillowy pita that surrounded my kabob was superb. We had a few falafel and half a bowl of soup to take home. Our server (who I imagine was an owner) made a fresh layer of lettuce, tomato and pickled veg for our falafel in the container. He also added more pita and tahini sauce free of charge. It's little touches like this that let you know how much the business cares. We are from out of town but we will always stop at Kabob-G when in town. Phenomenal place."}
{"text":"Eat here! Good, now that I've got your attention, this restaurant is wonderful. It's a small family owned restaurant that serves authentic Lebanese food. I took a group of 8 here, and everyone left happy. Highlights were:

1. Hummus
2. Baba ganoush - some of the best I've ever had
3. Chicken shawarma
4. Kufta 
5. Baklava
6. Rice pudding - best I've had. Tastes like there is rose water in it!

Lastly, the couple that runs the shop is incredibly friendly. I love supporting local restaurants, especially ones with such wonderful staff."}
