{"text":"Initially I like this place because the store was clean. I like the kitchen although tonight after paying for my food I was shorted one item as I watched the girl who took my money walk away with it on her plate getting ready to eat it. No one said anything. had I not checked I would've went home with less food than I had paid for and when I told her about the error she grabbed her plate and went back to the kitchen pretending that she was still preparing what I was shorted. not nice!! I asked for a refund and the staff looked at me like I did something wrong. They just lost a customer I often would go at least once a week. some of the items are cheaper at Walmart anyways. DISHONEST!!!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a store like this since moving here from San Diego 2 years ago. It was huge, and there were pi√±atas everywhere, and everyone was so nice. I literally walked around with my mouth hanging open I was so excited. Finally I had to sit down and eat a couple of empanadas and collect myself so I wouldn't buy the whole store. Bought some treats for my Suegra from the Colombian aisle, and stuff to make pico de gallo and salsa verde from the beautiful (and inexpensive) produce section. I got some pollo abodaba from the meat department which was delicious! Finally, I hit up the cheese case for a big bag of queso quesadilla. The only thing missing was fresh tortillas, but they assured me they were working to fix their machine. So I got a package of raw ones to cook at home. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Horrible if I could rate them a negative number or any stars I would! I order a birthday cake for my son 5th birthday with a week notice came time to pick his birthday cake and was told it had not been done and so many other excuses of why the cake had not been done. I will never order a cake or shop at this store I don't recommend anybody to either go to Walmart before coming here or Compare. They still had the nerves to charge us 25 for a cake that was not done wish I could upload a picture of it. Horrible experience I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting so long for this place to open. It seemed like it was under construction longer than my house. 

I finally got a chance to stop by and this place does not disappoint. Think of a Super G dedicated to Mexican/Latino/Hispanic/Central & South American foods with some other flavors thrown in. They have it well stocked and the aisles are divided by region so if you want central American spices, you head over there.  

They also have a huge Carniceria. Tons of meats and cheeses.  Lots of marinated and pre-spiced choices as well.  The cheese section was larger than most grocery stores and had varieties I had never heard of.  Wow. Marinated Milinesa and AL Pastor.  Wonderful selection.

I didn't spend much time in the vegetables section but they have fresh juices located just outside the fruit area.  That's nice.  

Their bakery is up and running with fresh empinadas and other breads, but the Tortilleria is setup, but not running as of the beginning of May 2016.  They've only been open a few weeka, so I'm sure that's not far off.  

All in all, very well stocked, clean, inviting.  Love that we have a real America's International Market.  

Can't wait to come back."}
