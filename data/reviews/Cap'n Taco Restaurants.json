{"text":"Stopped here after reading the reviews and left full and satisfied with what I had. Only thing I wanted was a better hot sauce other than the little plastic packet stuff they had!   Price was very low and the servings generous! The chicken was tasty and not simmered into \"mush\" like happens at many places.   Good place to stop and fill yourself up!"}
{"text":"Its was the worst place the old lady with the dirty blond hair need to get get some manners and learn how to talk to people she's very rude I think she needs not to touch the top of the glass when she would bring it to. Some one at the table tie back her hair she's working in a restaurant it's gross to see somebody's hair flying around why they're putting your food together i got hair in my togo bag its was sick i dont know how thay get away with the place looking like that old and dirty floor has tiles falling apart dust every were wash her hands after taking money then touch glasses and the togo silverware thats not wraped  she need a class for sanitation. When i got home i just throw my food out i will never go back !!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"They were open late., so that was convenient on a recent trip to cleveland when all else was closed. However, their chicken taco made me sick. Also this taco came with shredded chicken. That s it. And a packet of \"salsa\". Please paint over the misleading \"california\" from your signage."}
{"text":"Vintage atmosphere, unique menu, great staff/owner contributes to good time...Margaritas by the pitcher don't hurt either"}
{"text":"It's one of those cleveland area landmarks. Is it fancy chain burrito that weighs 9 lbs? no. It's just a little joint with they're own take on tacos, burritos and nachos and it's downright tasty!  The atmosphere inside is unique and fun with lots to look at and talk about with friends. Grab a couple beers or margaritas and relax cause your food will be out pretty fast and with a friendly smile. I almost always end up ordering an extra taco or two after the main course cause its just so good!  I give it 4.5 stars! But to be honest they couldn't nor would I want them to try anything else, it's just right!!! Keep up the good work Cap!"}
{"text":"Make sure you buy more than you want cause you'll be craving for their tacos for the rest of the day"}
{"text":"Great tacos! This place has been here before that other place with the little Chihuahua showed it's face here in Cleveland. Its a dive but the Taco's are wonderful. They use the Caso Blanco (white Mexican cheese) on their tacos. I don't know about their other menu items because the tacos are so good I never get anything else. Been going there for over forty years now, Check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Actual visit was 3/29/12. I tried the elite chicken n rice burrito and was not impressed.  All of the comments about the war zone pot holes in the parking lot are true.  If it hadn't been for Yelp reviews about this place, I would have never stopped in. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the burrito I did have will not make me go back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for cheap Mexican eats...this is the place!  Went here on a recent weekday (Taco Tuesday no less!) with a co-worker to give this post a try.  Given the day it was, of course I gave their tacos a try and threw in a California burrito for good measure.  Table service was pleasant and efficient, and i also noticed they did a fair amount of take-out business as well.  The theme of the interior is kind of like straight out of the movie \"Top Gun\"...tons of fly-boy memorabilia, pictures of airplanes (both old and new), lots of military stuff.  Kinda cool!  For lunch I had two ground beef hard-shell tacos and a shredded chicken California burrito.  The tacos were served with several packets of taco sauce (that i did not much care for as they were on the sweet side) and the meat lacked any real zip/flavor so i would put them in the Meh-category...but they were only $0.79 so that is a big bonus on the cheap eats side.  The California burrito was molten-hot, even almost all the way until it was completely consumed...that fryer they've got in the back must be a rock star!  The burrito has a good amount of shredded chicken inside as well as a nice compliment of Mexican spices and melted (white) cheese.  It was tasty and filling.  My co-worker ordered a taco and the Conquistador burrito that looked to have everything but the kitchen sink inside as smothered in chili.  He said it was really good, so that will be my \"go to\" next time here."}
{"text":"The war is over! The parking lot has been cleared of all unexploded ordinance and replaced. The axles on my car thank you. Food is still great!"}
{"text":"live in california for 18 yrs, always hit capt taco when i come back, hard shell tacos are amazing, cant stop eating them,"}
{"text":"Went there today.... Ordered a 1/2 lbs beef burrito and a beef hard taco elite.... Don't judge a book by its cover.... The place was awesome you need to go.. I just wish the fantastic taco was a little bigger... One word to say\"go\""}
{"text":"This is not your trendy, gourmet taco place. However in almost 20 years I have not had a problem except never ordering enough. Their hours have changed significantly since Brookpark Roads businesses have died down, so make sure they're open before going."}
{"text":"A nice change from Taco Bell.  I love the white cheddar they use on their tacos.  Not too crazy about the meat, so I get bean Elite Tacos (Elite = sour cream, lettuce, tomato).  Silly, but their taco sauce packets are sooooo good too, I swear the sauce and the cheese makes their tacos.  My only gripe, and I don't know if this is still so, you have to spend a minimum of $10 to use your credit card, otherwise you have to pay cash.  Wish there were more locations too, only one is about a 20 minute drive from my house."}
{"text":"Pro: Every time I am out by the airport I have to stop at Cap'n Taco. I enjoy their chicken captain sampler. What makes their tacos unique is the white cheese they use. The ground beef is not spicy, so you are given the option of adding your own sauce.  The chicken burritos while stripped down to just chicken, lettuce and cheese is plain, it is very good and always packed full of chicken.   Con: Not a fan of their beans though.  And the major issue with this location is their parking lot. Their parking lot has massive pot holes you could lose a small child in."}
{"text":"An iconic place that I truly love.  Amazing food and have been going there for over 30 years.  I live in Phoenix now but this place is a must stop.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Talk about a diamond in the rough.  This place is awesome.  Blink and you'll miss it - it is located on Brookpark Road by a little ways from the airport.  Open 11am-10pm M-Sa.  Closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"By far my favorite taco place. Every Tuesday - this is our ritual. Love it, wouldn't trade it for anything! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place!   I've Been coming here as a kid, and now as an adult as well. A little hole in the wall, with great food, and a fun atmosphere.  The chicken burrito is probably my favorite. Not a traditional Mexican style place, but I'll take a burrito from here over chipotle Any day.   Same girl is always working every time I stop in. She's friendly, and informative."}
{"text":"Old school goodness. I love this place. I always visit when I come back from California"}
{"text":"A lot of the haters didn't think I'd review Cap'n Taco, but here I am. If you're looking for modern Mexican cuisine, hit up chipotle. If you're looking to take your taste buds on a rollercoaster ride of authentic Mexican food, this is the place for you.   The taco shells are crisp and fresh and the sauce will take you on a one way trip to flavortown. Forget Taco Bell, this is the late night booty call you're looking for.   Sad that my friend Dominic (picture attached) refused to sample what the Cap'n was offering."}
{"text":"These guys suck.  I ordered a soft taco supreme,  cold meat that had no flavor, bunch of lettuce, a little sour cream and one piece of a diced tomato.  What a joke"}
{"text":"On the one hand, I'm sure this place is comforting and nostalgic for people who grew up around it.  On the other hand this might be the worst restaurant I've ever been to. The beef taco filling is a weird texture, and it's swimming in grease, like Jr. High cafeteria tacos.  On the other hand, this place is so bad, it's remarkable, and really worth checking out, just one time, plus it's cheap, and the decor and atmosphere are great. Everything about it looks like it should be a great little dive. But then... the food. I just don't even know what to say."}
{"text":"Jesus, why do I like this place now I don't want to! Kidding aside, I can't seem to stay away from this place and it's confusing. The taco meet is bland, and kind of a mixed bag on how much meat you get when you order tacos. However, I'm at this place like every other Taco Tuesday for carryout. It's the only quick alternative to Taco Bell. I can't stay away. Whatever you've done... well done?"}
{"text":"Used to go to cap 'n taco the time still go there occasionally when I get a taste for tacos nothing fancy just a nice place with good eats"}
{"text":"Love, love their crunchy beef taco supremes. They hold up well for carryout. The tostada was mushy and not good. They have special sauces for sale as add-ons, however, don't order. They charge .85 or so for a 1/2 oz. Crazy! Haven't tried the chicken. We used to love the seafood chimichangas years ago, but after a recent visit, won't buy again. It's just fake crab deep fried inside a flour tortilla shell.  The other thing we don't like about the place is it's pretty run down and dirty looking. If you're in the area, get the beef tacos they're a step above Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I've gotten take out from here before and I've always liked it. Yesterday, I decided to dine in. I tried a margarita- and it was so good! It also looked like they had about 5 drafts available. It came in a plastic cup, which I didn't mind at all. We had a friendly server, and the food came out so quick! They did mess up my order a little, but they fixed it right away no problem. The prices are comparable to Taco Bell, and the food is a little step above I would say. I went here with 2 other friends and there were no complaints. We will definitely be back to this little hole in the wall.  Try the tostada!"}
{"text":"Cap'n Taco is a cool little place situated on Brookpark Road. I came here with my brother for the $.79 cent taco Tuesday special. He got some of the hard shell tacos and I got the chicken California burrito. I really liked the California burrito, the chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy inside a deep fried shell with cheese. The hard shell tacos were basic tacos with meat, lettuce, and cheese. They came with packets of taco sauce which give the tacos a bit of flavor. The sauce is not spicy at all. My brother also got a side of rice and it was sort of dry and bland, nothing the taco sauce couldn't fix.  The inside of the restaurant was colorful and clean. The people working were really friendly and happy which is always a good thing. Also, the prices are really great!  Overall, we will return. There's a lot of other items on the menu we can't wait to try, especially the desserts."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for the better part of 8 years. Yes. It looks like a dive. Yes.  It's not in a great part of town.  Yes. You should eat here.   The food is cheap. I've always had a good meal. I typically order a la carte- a couple of small burritos and tacos. With a $3.99 frozen margarita served in a plastic green solo cup. Seriously. How does lunch get any better than that.   Walk in without preconceptions and an attitude and you should have a great lunch. Sure the staff may not always seem the most friendly. Yeah it's not the spiciest or most creative tacos and burritos.  But if you are like me and you treasure quiet, out of the way places with decent food at good value. Make. The. Trip."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a funeral lunch that just didn't cut it.  Ordered 2 soft bean tacos and they were far better than the Taco Bell I'm used too. I liked it a lot and will return!! Friendly fast service was icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"every time i walk in here i feel like ive died and gone to heaven. cheap tacos, good drinks. i live on the far east side of cleveland and me and my buddy from flordia always make a pilgrimage to this fine establishment and we usually bring a few people with us who never have had the honor and pleasure to consume such finery.   all kidding aside, this place rocks. the paking lot sucks.  whats awesome about this place is their t shirts and they have an old school wwf wrestlefest arcade machine."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for about 20 years and always a good time.  Hit the drive through and get the same great service each time.  Good place to take the kids and let them see some history inside.  Just a good way to spend your money with some local people keeping it real.  Blows Taco Bell away!  Just good people making some tasty food!    Check it out!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a loooong time.  It harks to the heyday of seedy Brookpark Rd stip clubs (r.i.p. Juicy Lucys)..  The place is super tiny but mostly clean.  They have margaritas (pre-made) and beer..  Th only real drawback is the HORRIBLE parking lot...it has HUGE holes.  Dont bring your low rider El Camino!  If your on Brookpark Rd getting a hotel room by the hour..stop and get a taco....hookers love em too... ;)"}
{"text":"This is a small taco place, nothing especially fancy. The tacos aren't bad, but they're nothing to write home about - pretty standard quality, and probably appropriate for the price. There's a seating area in the room adjacent to the order counter, but you may just want to take your food to-go, since the amount of tacos you have to order to warrant a credit card purchase is more than you'll be able to eat in one sitting."}
{"text":"I was so ready to try a new place for tacos when I drove past this little taco place. I was going to order at counter when a seemingly nice guy behind the counter points me to a small dining room where 1 other guest was seated.   He asked me if I wanted something to drink, & I told him no, I had brought my own.  He turned sour immediately & told me he couldn't allow me to do that. I tried in vain to explain to him that I was Diabetic & had many health issues that required me to drink only caffeine free diet drinks. I showed him my medical ID bracelet. Then I offered to put my diet ginger ale back in my purse & he could just bring me water.   Well that still wasn't good enough for him. He wanted to take my $30.00 Yeti cup away for the duration of my meal!   That was the last straw! (No pun intended) I have never, ever had an issue with using my own drink when the restaurant had nothing to offer similarly to align with my diet restrictions in any restaurant - expensive or fast food, since I was diagnosed 6 years ago.   This owner was the worst. how incredibly silly to turn away business over this. I hope Karma catches up with him. It always does."}
{"text":"love love love this place .. the hard shell tacos (be sure to indulge on taco Tuesdays) + beef/bean burritos are my go to dishes .. because things are made to order the wait for your food can be long .. but all good things come to those that wait .. I have experienced a 10+ minute wait in the drive thru .. the parking lot is full of pot holes so it is a bit like driving thru a mine field so be careful you do not blow a tire .. sucks that they are not open on Sunday OR Monday .."}
{"text":"Great food! Exceeded expectations. Best Taco Tuesday value in Cleveland. Service could use some improvement."}
{"text":"Cap'n Taco is okay, and it's rare to find a taco dive other than Taco Bell.  It's located all by itself on Brookpark Rd. so don't pass it!  The tacos come overloaded with cheese and they do have a good flavor.  The great thing is you can get beer if you dine-in, but the place is so dumpy, you're better off rolling with \"to-go\".  I usually get some tacos to go on my way home from work.  We like em because they're different than other restaurants and they're yummy.  But they do put a load of cheese on the tacos, which I'd prefer not to have.  Recommend - if you're looking for something more authentic than Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I must say Brookpark has enjoyed 40 plus years of this place this was my first time eating here . The staff is super nice and the ambiance lots of aviation photos very nice and cozy inside . They sell alcoholic beverages didn't try any of them but a plus ! I had the signature Burrito the Conquistador 8.39 but a classic flavor a must try ! Prices are fabulous brought my kids back some tacos they love em . They sell Cap'n Taco apparel inside cool stuff . They also have a drive thru .Great place thanks for the great meal!"}
{"text":"Like everyone, I have limited time on my lunch and called to place an order to Go. I was asked if my order was going to be over $20. When I told her no, she said she wouldn't take my order. I told her I would be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service was great! Very nice lady covering counter and tables. Food was hot.  Nothing great but edible. Don't spend the extra 30 cents on \"elite\" tacos for sour cream and tomatoes. Not worth it Nachos were ok but had some weird seasoning on em. Not bad, but not good. Would go back to support a local business but not for the love of it."}
{"text":"This joint is the epitome of guilty pleasure/gluttony/comfort food. I have loved The Cap'n since I was a boy. And still do.  Is this \"authentic\" Mexican cuisine? No. And without apology. It is what it is; and that is delicious.   No trip of mine to Cleveland is complete with a tussle with a 1/2 pound Burrito Elite at Cap'n Taco. The Midwest never married old Meh-he-co better then The Cap'n, so do yourself a favor and brave the parking lot. It is worth the rigor, and part of the charm.  You can trust a gringo like me!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and very inexpensive.  Way better than Taco Bell or chipotle.  Service is also great.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the parking lot that is worse than most city streets after a harsh winter."}
{"text":"I went today with my boyfriend and his sister. Our waitress Sandy was fun and friendly! The beef and cheese nachos were amazing as well as the tacos! We all ate good lol"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and affordable! The atmosphere is a little divey but that's all part of the charm. The enchiladas are a favorite, as well as the hard tacos. YUM!!!!"}
