{"text":"Beautiful decor and delicious food! Family owned and intimate. Definitely will come back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Really lovely decor and friendly staff (though a bit inexperienced). I have been twice for lunch and both meals were delicious and fresh. The salmon poke bowl was excellent and beautifully presented. The vegetarian bibimbap was very good, lots of a fresh veggies and rice was cooked well, it needed a slight bit more seasoning but the siracha did the trick! The banh mi sandwich was enormous and packed full with deliciously marinated meat and pickled vegetables, it also came with fries which were great. My sister has had the ramen and was very disappointed, but the menu is vast and so far everything I have tried was excellent and I will happily go again!"}
{"text":"This cute little Korean fusion restaurant pleasantly surprised us with both food and its stylish decor. It is a casual place that brings a bit more creativity and sophistication in the growing Korean restaurant scene in Montreal and pays attention to details. 

Some classic dishes (bibimbap, japchae, etc) are similar to what other Korean restaurants would serve and were fresh and very good. The kalbi was especially tender and tasty. Some dishes stand out by their creativity: the poke was fresh and delicious with a mix of hamachi, grilled edamame beans, corn, seaweed, etc with a delicate sesame and yuzu taste; and kimchi fries are very good, like a Korean poutine. 

The decor is casual but stylish with beautiful celadon plates on the walls, and even the serving plates used are of nice quality ceramic. 

Even though we have only been there a few times, the friendly owner recognized us each time and even remembered what we had ordered the previous time. 

Prices are slightly higher than in some other Korean restaurants but still in the casual range, and the difference in the quality justifies it. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I live close by so I wanted to try a local restaurant. Recently a neighborhood favourite (Prohibition) had closed and I was looking for a replacement. Luckily this opened up not too much later.  

Everything I have had off of the menu is absolutely delicious and the decor and atmosphere in general is very pleasant with good service. I extra recommend the ramen or the sweet potato noodles. The prices are affordable and I am going back tomorrow :D"}
{"text":"My first and only Korean cuisine experience in Montreal so far. I ordered 3 rounds of kimchi, a seaweed salad, and the bulgogi main course. Everything was perfect. The service was great and very open about sharing other places to find great Korean food in the city."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new korean restaurant to try and found this place! 

Good but expensive.

Service was excellent.

The fries were tasty! One of the best \"korean poutine\" I had!  I had the soondubu. It was good, just not spicy enough to my liking.  The portions are smaller than usual, and more expensive. But the food tastes great!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and the restaurant was clean. That's all the good things I have to say about this restaurant. 
We ordered a bulgogi and chicken bibimbap for 2 people. 
The bulgogi portion was small compared to other restaurants. The meat was bland without the garlic kick associated with Korean cuisine. 
You choose your protein to add to the bibimbap. We chose chicken. When it arrived we called the server over because we thought they made a mistake and gave us just a vegetable bibimbap. She took it away and quickly returned saying \"look there's a piece of chicken, and there's another one. \" If we couldn't see it unless we inspected under a microscope - it clearly wasn't enough. 
The price is high for the quality / portion size ratio. We left hungry and disappointed. 
There are far better Korean cuisine restaurants in the city. I suggest a pass on this one."}
{"text":"Great bibimbap, I would recommend KIWA's bibimbap over Petit Tokebi just down the street even though I like both. Comparable price but Kiwa is slightly fresher. I would definitely recommend it. $17 with beef and Dol Sot. $15 in a cold bowl with fried egg. Get the hot bowl, chili sauce is essential, try it out."}
{"text":"Oh I love this place, been here like 5 times, its on the pricier side for Korean food but well worth it, U gots ta have the kimchi fries  ! They are so good!!!
The other stuff is great to, lots of flavor and fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Service is fast and polite, good food, good options. Never been to a Korean place where I liked their music though."}
{"text":"First off, no kimchi or sides to start? Is that even a thing? Secondly, the amount of meat that came with the bibimbap could have fit in a thimble. It was a tasty yet weak bibimbap. 

The restaurant itself was lovely and the service quite good, but this was one of the first times I've eaten bibimbap and still been hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"The place was small but very nicely set up. It was welcoming and the music created a surprisingly nice ambiance. The staff was nice, the food was good, and it's definitely a good choice for a casual Korean lunch or dinner. I had the bulgogi and it was delicious :)"}
