{"text":"The three of us had lunch here last Friday and loved everything about this place: the atmosphere, lighting, food, drinks, servers and decor.  We ordered ruebens and burgers, all tasty, and the regular fries and sweet potato fries were excellent too.  They have a stage for entertainment, another area filled with kid toys, and upstairs rooms for community activities.  They have friendly, sharp, quick staff that are a delight. It has the fun, funky vibe of a Madison East Side Classic like Weary Traveler. Next Friday night we're coming for the fish fry."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on Saturday at about 9:15.  It took more than 45 minutes for our order, 3 Greek scramblers, to arrive.  We had ordered 2 with hash browns.  The order arrived, none with hash brown and each scrambler order was a different size, one was 1/2 the size of the largest one.  The taste was fine.  We inquired about the missing hash browns and were told that we hadn't paid for them, even though the cashier had come to check that one scrambler was ordered without hash browns. We were told that it would take a long time to get hash browns at this point because there were many other orders, so we canceled.  We had to ask for the bagel that was ordered.  It came cold, without any butter or jam.    The dining experience was a disappointment for a place that previously had 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"This place is just awesome! I enjoyed lunch here with family and we loved the laid back atmosphere with professional, friendly service. It's a great place for kids and adults alike. The menu offers a variety of options, including vegan and vegetarian (I appreciate this so much!) and a creative kids menu-my son loved his \"nibbly plate\". We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really nice place to meet up with friends. Good food, good atmosphere, great people.  Saturday nights are great with Durango. Took out of town company there. Everyone had a great time"}
{"text":"This is a really cool concept combining an event space, community center and restaurant. A wonderful addition to Middleton. We stopped by for brunch, and it was excellent. Pancakes with lovely fresh fruit - the pancakes were vegan, with chia, flax oats and almond milk. We also tried really unique hash - with corned beef and veggies. It would have been nice if the veggies had been cut up a bit more (ie, so it resembled a hash!), and The corned beef wasn't very special. The lunch menu looks interesting, and the pancakes alone are enough to bring me back for brunch.   The overall vibe of the place is super inviting, with fun decor, and live music - a guy with a guitar, at just the right volume. Clearly a lot of thought went in to sourcing locally, and being environmentally conscious. I'm looking forward to the art event that I registered for, and hope this place will be around for a long time."}
{"text":"The lighting and atmosphere was absolutely perfect. We went on a Friday night and it was pretty busy but the service was still great and the food was delicious. Everyone was friendly, there were all different groups/types of people, the music was good and not loud at all so it didn't disrupt dinner and was a great compliment to it. I'm looking forward to their future dinner/lunch specials and hopefully coming out during the week to check out some events they are hosting. I'm so glad this place exists!  :)"}
{"text":"Is it a coffee shop? A diner? An event venue? Common Ground, open in Middleton since January, is all three - and more. I visited three times in the last week or so, trying to sample a little bit of their multifaceted personality. The spacious main floor includes a large dining area with lots of character: dark wood floors and paneling, a distinctive coffered ceiling with naked incandescent bulbs, cozy tables and chairs, a few booths, a stage for entertainment, and a bar area. Order at the counter, maybe pick up a baked good for breakfast? and let them bring your food items to your table. Bus your own table after the meal.  First, I met a friend there for lunch, and we each chose the soup-of-the-day (clam chowder). It was creamy and delicious. Water is self-served from two attractive icy urns on opposite ends of the counter. Silverware, napkins and condiments are located by the urns.   I returned that same evening with my wife. We go out every few weeks with a friend of ours and decided to give Common Ground's dinner fare a try. Their non-breakfast menu is largely sandwiches and burgers but they also have a nice selection of appetizers (cheese board, hummus plate, etc.). The Rachel (a turkey Ruben) was delicious but on the small side. The burger and patti-melt were yummy and perfectly made. The regular and sweet-potato fries were cooked to perfection and lightly salted. I was glad to see Common Ground's portions stay on the modest end of the spectrum. Too many restaurants temp patrons with unnecessarily enormous portion sizes.  I ventured back a few days later for an early morning cup of coffee and bagel and brought some reading material and my laptop for an extended reading and study session. Common ground is a comfortable and inviting space for a relaxing morning meeting with friends or a solo session with a book or electronic device. Coffee includes one free refill, and the bakery will tempt you with a muffin, scone or roll. The obvious availability of board games throughout the space practically demands that you stay for awhile. The performance area on the raised stage has tiled black/white pattern suggestive of a chessboard. Sure enough, on the window sill are gigantic chess pieces should you want to play a jumbo-sized game. During my first visit, a father and son were engaged in an epic match - and having a great time walking around the board as they pushed pawns and attacked the opposing king.  The upstairs is a spacious meeting area with its own bar. It was unused when I went up to peek, but it appears to be part yoga studio, meeting room, kids' play area and supplemental dining room.  Common Ground's ambiance is accented by music playing throughout, courtesy of some wall mounted Sonos speakers. On my three visits, the music was always contemporary folk and alt-singer/songwriter - perfect for my tastes. The volume was just right - audible but never distracting. And the wifi is wicked fast.  I have two small complaints: at some point after their January opening, they had changed their hours, but not their signs. I arrived for my breakfast visit at 6:45 am, 15 minutes after their advertised weekday opening time of 6:30, but the doors were locked. After a few minutes of loitering and looking through the windows, the woman who was opening came to the door and informed me that the owners had changed the hours, but not the signs. I hung around and waited 15 minutes, and she had the doors opened promptly at 7. Regrettably, they had no bagels on the menu that day, but the coffee was fresh and delicious, and I had a chance to sample their breakfast menu instead. The fried egg and sausage sandwich was scrumptious!  PS: for those who like to sit and study or read, CG should consider adding a bottomless option to their coffee menu. Currently, they offer 12oz and 16oz options with one free refill (the 16oz costs $2.25 plus tax). why not just offer a bottomless mug for $4.00? Loiterers like me would opt for it every time!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. Great Friday night fish fry. Super appreciate the gluten free options. I plan on making this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"So this review is more of the facility as I have yet to enjoy their food.  I do drop-in yoga on Fridays when I can and it is phenomenal.  The space is pleasant and bright with all the windows, pretty clean and the upstairs room is very usable for multiple things.    Back to yoga - pay what you can when you go, sign a liability and be prepared to relax and push your body.  It's a class for multiple levels, adapt to what works for you.  There's often been music downstairs that sounds good and lovely staff.  And it's amazing to have a parking lot!  A big parking lot even!"}
