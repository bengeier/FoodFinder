{"text":"walked in first time there, ordered small Balance pasta, for the price i assume all ingredients are organic, gmo free, and all animals are treated humanly. I'm not sure if this is true but for the price it should be. 
The pasta was okay but I was disappointed that they just through the flax seeds on top in the to-go carton instead of mixing it in."}
{"text":"The menu is basic but provides a good range of tasty items. The greek fries are very well done. Not fried to a crisp but just right. Seasoning and cheese on top make for the perfect starter. The pizzas are undoubtedly some of the best in the city. Whether it be make your own or one of the many house combinations you won't be disappointed. Recommend getting the whole wheat base as it's helps with the post stomach grumblings of pizza eating. The tandoori special is to die for and the vegan pizzas are too notch. Atmosphere is very cozy and the service is always a joy. Highly recommend a visit here people."}
{"text":"Vegan pizza was good but it's too pricey. diaya frozen pizza tastes the same. I'd rather spend $10 than 25.
I went to the eglinton one and there was no dining area which I thought there would be. I was disappointed but the food was good. Also the service was good. Cheerful. 
Won't be going back unless someone wants to treat me. Lol."}
{"text":"Vegan pizza was good and customer service was good. Jolly man which I liked.. it's just too pricey for me. 
Make your own vegan pizza, get frozen, or get pizza nova vegan pizza. Better price than a dinky pizza for almost 20 ."}
{"text":"Had a pizza there for lunch. Ordered the veggie magic and it was excellent. Service was good, granted it was pretty empty at noon. They also had plenty of craft brews there. I would return again."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good, especially for being organic. I was disappointed they had no sweet potatoes when I went, so I couldn't get my top choice. Instead I got the Double Hawaiian, which was good but nothing special. 

The hibiscus iced tea was nice, if a bit strange. 

I had excellent service the whole time, since it was very quiet."}
{"text":"Our waitress said hi to us and continued to text on her phone. We asked for menus after ten minutes.. She told us she spaced out. 
Not the best service, we were very much ignored so my best friend and I started to drink from our own booze.

I like their cake."}
{"text":"I have requested take out several times.  I know there is some concern about delay in delivery, but come on folks - this area is under huge construction , I would blame the horrible city of  Toronto for their urban planning in the less than perfect delivery time!  I chose Magic Oven for their great healthier options.  This little one does not disappoint, consistently friendly and consistently delicious."}
{"text":"This pizza was just OK.  Nothing special.  At a price of almost $40 for two small pizzas, I would expect a lot more.  Also, the chicken didn't quite taste a 100% fresh.  For that price, you can get a whole lot more for your money in every way, including gluten free."}
{"text":"I ordered online at 6:45.... at 8:30, my delivery has not arrived. I live 3 blocks away (I have kids at home, can't leave to walk and pick-up). I called at 8pm and was told order left 10 minutes ago, I called again at 8:18 and was told the order was still there, but they didn't have a driver. 

This is not the first or second time their delivery has been sketchy - worse, they've lied to me about the status/whereabouts of my order. Whether the order shows up anytime soon (we're pushing 2 hours now), is even warm (doubtful given they told me it's been on warmers for the last 25 mins)... honestly - for the price and subsequent headache - DONT\" DO IT."}
{"text":"great gluten free pizzas. great service. great beer selection. Best place to eat in Cork town."}
{"text":"First, I'll say that I love how vegan-friendly this place is. They have vegan-by-default pizzas and other items on the menu, but can also veganize most items by making substitutions. I love the veganized version of the Tandoori Magic and the Phytonutrient Magic (though I preferred the latter in its earlier incarnation, which had asparagus and other green veggies on it). 

I'm not giving them more stars because the prices are a bit too high for my liking and because on two recent orders, I clearly requested vegan cheese but received a pizza with regular cheese. The first order was take-out, and one pizza came with regular cheese though the others came with Daiya. The next was a dine-in order, and when I politely brought it to the waitress' attention, she didn't apologize. She took it back to the kitchen and replaced it, but I was a bit annoyed that she didn't acknowledge the mistake on the restaurant's behalf. It could have been serious if I had an allergy and hadn't recognized that the cheese was dairy-based. I work in customer service, and would have reacted much differently had something similar happened in my workplace."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: It's my goal to get this Magic Oven on Danforth up to a solid 4-Star rating from it's current 3.5, and tonight's take-out experience will illustrate why.

Being short on time preparing for the long weekend and two kids pleading, \"I'm hungry!\" we doubled-down on pizza from Magic Oven for the second Friday in a row. Last week's experience left us remarking a) how much the kid's loved their Double Hawaiian and b) how much we adults enjoyed the Euphoria Magic on their Gluten-Free crust (one of the BEST GF pizza's we've ever had). Crisp and thin of a cracker-like texture with no mealy-gritty-aftertaste won us over to order again.

This week we branched out and ordered 1 pound of wings and a \"Build Your Own Pizza\" on GF crust with proscuitto, figs, walnuts, and mozzarella on a garlic and olive oil base, along with another Hawaiian for our boys. 

There was a problem... okay two problems. First, our BYOPizza was a little scant on toppings. Granted we selected premium-hipster-toppings which tasted great, but it still left us feeling a little jilted. Second, the \"side of fries or greens\" (we went fries) were absent from our small wing order which consisted of 7 wings. For those keeping score at home, at $13 for 1 lb, with tip & tax that's about $2 per wing. Now these wings were MONSTERS; big and crispy and tasty with no breading done up salt-n-pepper style with the garlic-chili sauce served on the side (just the way we like it). 

So why 5-Stars when the food-portion:food-quality ratio was shouting 4-Stars? A: Service. When I called to ask about the dainty toppings and missing fries, I received a very polite and very reasonable apology and explanation, topped off with a $10 \"We're Sorry\" credit on my next visit or order. Nice, nice, very nice. 

If you find yourself willing to part with a little more dough for fewer woes topped with a cherry of quality-first, order from Magic Oven and then join me in raising this under-rated-pizza-place up to the 4-Stars it truly deserves."}
{"text":"have celiac so always hesitant to eat out.  reviews for this place pegged it ok for me so on a very hot day we went for takeaway pizza. $35 for 2 smalls (incl 1 margh - and they are SMALL) and now MY STOMACH IS FCKD. havent been like this in a long long time and can look forward to an unpleasant next few days and the inev week of tiredness that will follow. this is not good pizza, even the normal. if you think it is YOU NEED TO GET OUT MORE. i dont know what they did this is but totally unacceptable. if there was a minus 10 stars i'd give it minus 11. piss off, magic oven..."}
{"text":"Magic Oven offers delicious food at reasonable prices. Great selection of vegan and gluten free options. Great dessert menu. The lime coconut gluten free cake is a must try :)."}
{"text":"If you're gluten intolerant, then this place is heaven for you. Usually enjoy their pizza a lot but also tried their gluten-free cake today, it's all good. The place is packed at lunch time. Service was not bad either."}
{"text":"I had a great experience! I went by last week for the first time and I ordered a Uber Pepperoni and some wings which came with complimentary fries. The food was hot and filling and amazing! I suggest you to check this place out."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. My server was nice and attentive. I got the soup of the day and the cauliflower lasagna. The soup, which was roasted garlic chicken soup, was nicely balanced, flavourful and had lots of chicken and veggies. You could tell it was made with a real broth. The lasagna came with a side salad. it was amazing. It was baked fresh and cheesy and filling.

I will be definitely be going again and recommending it for sure!"}
{"text":"Really expensive and honestly not that tasty. It's great that it's organic and healthy but the cost doesn't outweigh it. Expect to spend $20-30 per person to have a good meal."}
{"text":"The food is good, but $20 for a small 4 slice pizza is a bit over
the top. The pasta is also good but again pricey. There are many
places that offer similar food that is just as good for a better price. 

Good but WAY Over-priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Overpriced food.  Horrible website - missing restaurant locations, difficult to navigate, unable to choose pick-up vs. delivery, differing prices on website vs. calling in is unfair.  Too bad.  The food is quite tasty, but the service and price and website has completely put me off.  No wonder it's always dead when I walk by.  Sorry, lost a customer.

{"text":"I have seen the place change owners about four times in the last 15 years... Tonight I took the wife in for wine and wings... We had a couple of pounds of wing and fries, house wine for me and a cocktail for the wife... I'm presuming the wings were organic, I came to this conclusion 'cause I finished plucking the damn feathers off...

The service was stellar. (Thank you)

The atmosphere was stellar.

The price was reasonable.

The wings were crap (As was the fries)

I had a look in the (open) kitchen, they have all the goods to make a great meal, just not the talent.

I went Friday night at about 8.

We doggy bagged the wings, A wee bit of TLC with heat and \"BAM\" I've got breakfast.

When this place was \"Paradise\"  an owner or two ago it was much better food wise, the lay out is better now and the back patio seems to have been cleaned up.

They push the Pizza and Beer... may be that all they can do?"}
{"text":"This place has lots of great food, including lots of vegan options for pizza, pastas, appetizers, and at least one vegan dessert.  It's also organic (I think completely organic, but at least mostly) which is a plus.

I've tried the vegan magic and black magic pizzas and they were both delicious! The black magic pizza included a vegan cheese that melted just like dairy cheese. 

The mix of vegan and non-vegan food (as well as gluten-free options) makes it a good place to go with a group that has varying dietary restrictions or a group where some people have dietary restrictions and others are picky!"}
{"text":"So, i am a huge pizza buff, its like the best thing I can think of to eat. but not exactly known to be healthy. my GF is on me to be more health conscious, even though i weekly go to shoppers drug mart., do the blood pressure monitor thing, and give her the print out to prove the splendour of my health ( 65 bpm, 72/110)

magic oven seemed like the solution, healthy pizza, TAD AAH!

there's a lot of good points, organic toppings, multi grain crusts, a lot of interesting  vegan toppings, lactose free cheese, and if i was a Vegan with a gluten allergy, i think this would be my blue heaven. but as i am practically a black bear in my eating habits, that factor didn't really appeal. its almost as if the menu was specifically designed for people with allergies, which is great. 

what they offer in variety, they sacrifice in flavor. maybe 4 years ago this level of pizza at these prices would have been acceptable, but lets face it, with Queen Marg down the street, and libretto moving in, the bar has been raised. at best, Magic oven tastes  like the best frozen pizza you can buy, but the flavour of the sauce, and the lack of a real decent cheese, couple with an overly... biscuit-y crust, its just not in the league any longer.  

great concept, and i am glad that people who need a spelt crust with low acid tomato, lactose free cheese, vegan pepperoni and broccoli pizza have a place, its just not my kinda joint."}
{"text":"awful. cold, cardboard pizza delivered late. overpriced, undeserved rep as a hi end joint"}
{"text":"**I have only ever had delivery**

I only write yelp reviews when a place is so amazingly good, or terribly, disappointingly bad. This experience was terrible. 

I WANT this place to be good. Quality, healthy ingredients are important to me. I will pay more for it. But this was the worst pizza I have ever had. I could have  had a better pizza experience making a pizza from tortillas and left overs from my fridge.

It took over 2 hours to deliver 2 pizzas. And when they finally arrived, they were stone cold. I had to cover it with sauces from my fridge to ingest it. I have had Magic Oven at least 5 times. 1/5 times were good. You think I would have learned the first 4 times. I just really wanted them to be good. 

Overall :("}
{"text":"Nothing really bad about the place. But a kind of lack luster franchise type of place. The food was ok, but I feel like it comes in 5 gallon pails from the same distribution warehouse as all other chain restaurants. I won't return, but again, no real complaint."}
{"text":"DRY- the crust tasted like cardboard and I'm not just saying that because it's a saying. It was a no sauce specialty pizza so you'd think they'd be generous with the olive oil, toppings and cheese but no. So not only was the crust dry but the overall flavor experience was too. I swear they calculated 3 small sweet potatoes, 3 figs and 1-2 blobs of Gorgonzola cheese per slice. It was super underwhelming and very disappointing considering how pricey they are! $26 for a DRY large pizza with a rationed amount of toppings- screw you magic oven! Only redeeming component was the customer service. If you're in the Junction, order from Vesuvio's!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food. The staff was very attentive. I brought in a coupon that they were not ready to support so they gave me a 10% discount instead.  It was a Friday night and it was a little slow. The place was packed and it felt like they were a little understaffed. But overall good experience and I'll definitely keep this place in mind."}
{"text":"We ordered from here once a few months ago and it was fine. We just recently ordered a combo pizza and wing deal and it was terrible. The pizza was cold and had no flavour, the wings had no sauce even though I asked for some, and the garlic bread was missing the cheese I paid extra for. The fries were also soggy. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"3/5! Recommend the Tandoori chicken magic or the veggie magic pizzas. I recommend the pizzas over the other mains/appetizers. The decor is a bit dated. This would be a great place to order from!"}
{"text":"Love magic oven and LOVE this location. Only reason they didn't get 5 stars is that their prices are a bit high - you're going to pay about $20 for a small (4 slice) gluten-free pizza. But, it's delicious. And there are about a gazillion and one toppings to choose from (oddly they seem to lack olives...but maybe that's just a menu oversight). The pizza is delicious, I personally love the gluten free crust - yes, it's a bit crispier than the regular but it's just like having this crust and the taste is great.  I've tried gluten-free crust from pizza pizza, pizza nova's, pizzaiollo and mama's pizza and all of those taste like burnt CARDBOARD. NOT magic oven's crust - it's amazing! NOTE: they have recently changed their gluten-free crust. I have only tried it once and it was a lot fluffier and was nicely chewy but incredibly salty and had a weird taste...I will need to try it again before I comment more fully on it.

There are TONS of options for the vegan, the non-vegan, the gluten-free and the non-gluten-free. I often pick this place when I'm eating with non-vegans because there are so many choices.

LOVED the vegan chickpea soup, love the tropical pizza and the black magic pizza. They also have great gluten-free vegan desserts - including a VERY rich and delicious chocolate fudge cake. And there are tons of salads and pasta, but I always prioritize pizza so can't really comment on them.

Love the service. We often get one girl with kickass tattoos who is super friendly.

The decor is nice and you get free green apples on your way out. AND there's a fireplace you can sit by when you're in the mood for an extra cozy dining experience. I've been to other magic ovens and definitely like this one best."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here 3 times now, in the past 3 weeks. The first pizza was a classic pepperoni, VERY hard to screw up, unless you are Magic Pizza. I am a vegetarian/ vegan on most days with my fiancé but love meat here and there and thinking oh organic it should be good. It looked like a Cafeteria pizza you'd get in school. The second pizza was alright on terms of toppings, the third which I am eating now tastes just like burnt toast with a thin layer of cheese or something on it. In other words if you want a non GMO, Organic pizza, go to the store buy or make organic yeast get organic flour cure your own meats, buy or make organic cheese and grow fresh basil and tomato. Right there you could make one serving of pizza for $4.00 no need to pay $15 or $ 32 including tip but the pizza delivery guy insisted on pocketing my $35!!!! Go get your kids, and have family time don't waste your time with Magic Pizza and its long delivery and burnt toast pizza unless that is your thing, ten be my guest! this was the last, I try things 3 times and hoped really did as I am a supporter of non GMO, and support organic and home farming. This was S**T!!!"}
{"text":"Poor management.  Probably explains the numerous closed locations.   There are a number of reviews complaining of food poisoning on Google, and advising of red and yellow flags issued by the health department."}
{"text":"Lovely italian restaurant. We ordered pizza with dried tomato and the crust was gorgeous."}
{"text":"The service at Magic Oven was very good.  The goat cheese appetizer dip was delicious!  However, we were a bit disappointed in the pizzas.  They were seriously lacking cheese!

I had a really interesting pizza, with sweet potato and gorgonzola cheese (it had a specific name - from the \"vegetarian\" section of the menu).  My pizza was alright, but nothing too special.  Some of my eating buddies had a more basic pizza, and it was just downright boring....mainly due to the lack of cheese.

This place gets 3 stars, however, because it has many vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free options.  It's nice that they care about healthy eating and accommodating their clients."}
{"text":"This resto is a little pricey for the overall food quality, however, a good selection of unique menu items has seen us going back several times in the last few years.  Service was good, the beer even better."}
{"text":"Friends often tell me how much they love the pizza here, but I find it to be pretty average. The sandwiches are OK, too.

My main gripe about this place is the service. I find it to be slow and almost non-existent on some occasions.

On my last visit (it was an early Sunday afternoon, we were the only table), the waitress brought us water and menus but then for the next 10-15 minutes sat behind the bar (messing around on a computer and/or her phone) and didn't bother to ask us if we were ready to order (even though we had closed our menus and placed them aside.

We told her we were ready, and she came over. After she brought us our food, she disappeared and didn't come back until we were finished eating (by then, our glasses had been empty for awhile).

I've had problems with the service at the Queen Street location, too. It seems like every time I go I'm served by someone who has little experience."}
{"text":"Sloppy Bunjo where have you been all my life?

I can't describe it any better than they do:
\"Yellow peas simmered in a mix of tomatoes, cumin, turmeric and a blend of other herbs and spices stuffed in a soft white bun and garnished with chopped onions, cilantro, tamarind chutney and hot sauce.\"

I got the standard, but next time I'm definitely getting the samosa sloppy bunjo. Take the recipe above and add a delicious, broken-up samosa to the mix. My DC loved it.

We need more places like Market 707 / Scadding Court Market in Toronto. Head to Dundas just west of Bathurst and check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"We were so busy in Toronto that the first night we missed dinner and the restaurants we wanted to go to were all closed, so we went to Magic Oven.  It was a newly opened location, and the guy running it was super nice.  He was patient, as we were indecisive, and he helped us build a pizza the cheapest way so both people eating were happy with toppings.
The owner told us the veggies all come from local farmers markets.  That is really cool!  And they use Daiya vegan cheese (if ordered) which really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My partner and I tried out this establishment yesterday for the first time and will not be returning:

1) The service we received here wasn't great. 
- The waitress was fine until the food came into play, then her service went downhill. She gave us the food and drink menus and didn't take them back after we had ordered, even when we purposefully placed them at the edge of the table.
- She then brought our pizza before our plates and cutlery, so we had to sit there staring at it while we waited for her to come back. When she did bring the plates she had only brought one set of cutlery, so we had to wait again as she went and got another set. (How do you make three trips for one meal?)
- The server did not come and ask how our food was; she was inattentive and did not ask if we wanted another pint when we were sitting there with empty glasses and clearly were not leaving
- We asked for our food to go and then the waitress forgot to give it to us before we left so we had to go back for it once we remembered.

2) Food:
- The pizza was decent, although the \"make your own\" pizza section seemed very overpriced, which was why we did not order from it. We instead ordered the Harmony Magic. 
- \"garlic bread with mozzarella\" apparently translates to \"$7 cheese on white toast,\" so don't bother with that. At all. You can make a much better grilled cheese or cheese on toast at home for much better value."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I come here often as Magic Oven can accommodate all of my dietary restrictions. It's often so hard to get a slice of pizza custom made without having to order a whole pizza. The slices are huge and delicious, and only 5 bucks - a GREAT price considering I order veggie with spelt crust and vegan cheese. I think 5 bucks for a huge slice with great ingredients is definitely fair. Other places might charge 3 bucks for a slice that's been sitting out for a while, and isn't exactly what I want. I will gladly chip in an extra 2 bucks to get a fresh slice any day! It's always fast, which is much appreciated as I'm often rushed to grab a bite to eat in between clients. The vegan chickpea soup is always good and piping hot. I've tried some desserts as well which were also fantastic.
Not only that, the staff are incredible! Always SO friendly at this location. Such a good vibe when I walk in. 
Always a treat, thanks guys! I look forward to the next time I am too lazy to bring my own lunch to work!

Sophia - KLHC"}
{"text":"Enh. 
I'd never eat here again. If you watch them make the pizza you can tell that it is not even fresh dough; they pull pre-made crusts out of the fridge! 

Maybe that explains why some reviewers have had crusts that were too thick; the staff can't do anything about it if the establishment won't change their ways."}
{"text":"The pizza here was okay. Small portion sizes for the price paid.  $16 plus tax for a small hawaiian pizza (which was only 4 slices) + additional charge for spelt crust... 
Generous toppings on the pizza.
I wouldn't go back nor would I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I miss this place. I used to go here once a week while in school in Toronto and it is amazing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We really like this place but the last two times we have been there, 6 months apart, we have been served cheesecake with mould. We didn't have to pay for the slice with mould but we did have to pay for the others. Suffice it to say this does not inspire confidence."}
{"text":"I really love this place! The pizzas are delicious and I feel great knowing that they use a lot of organic/non-gmo products and produce. The juices could be a bit more creative as they use santa cruze juice products and just make various mixes but they still taste pretty good. 

The staff is very friendly and professional. I need to go back soon."}
{"text":"Now, granted, it's pretty hard to compare MO to a pizzeria like Libretto (best in the city IMO), but once in a while I'll opt for laziness and organic. If you're thinking of ordering in, it would be good to order at least an hour before you're going to be hungry. It took 90 minutes for my pizza to arrive...which is a little longer than the 60 minutes they quoted me.  

After the hour came and went I felt like I was getting stood up by a booty call. And I mean one that's not even that good looking but you just answer the text because you're horny. 

Anyway, if you've never had pizza before then I'd say it's not bad. It might be a good idea to work on the spelt and gluten free crusts as they're a little underwhelming. Oh well, the price of trying to take the nutritional high road."}
{"text":"I usually order pizza and the power soup from this magic oven location. Today I decided to switch it up and buy a $19 cauliflower lasagna with meat sauce. This was the most pathetic excuse for a lasagna. Clunky pieces of \"roasted\" cauliflower with way too much cheese, barely any meat and a sadly mediocre tomato sauce. It was basically cauliflower tossed in a thick cheese and tomato sauce, really disappointed especially for the price. Ended up having a few bites and tossing it, just ate my power soup.. I gave stars because their pizza is still consistently good. Wish I ordered that instead!"}
{"text":"Terribly disorganized with zero knowledge in customer service. I placed an order at 6pm online, and shortly after received a confirmation email that my order would take 45-90 minutes. 7:45pm rolled around and I still hadn't received my delivery, so I decided to call them up and find out what the ETA on my order would be. The girl who picked up told me (her words, not mine) that my order had been \"lost in translation\" because it was a busy night and they had a lot of orders coming in. When asked why nobody had bothered to notify me between then and the time I had initially placed my order 2 hours prior to this conversation, I got another half-assed \"we're busy\" type response, followed by \"we can have your order delivered in another hour and a half,\" and a credit for \"next time.\" At this point, if I hadn't (obviously) canceled my order, I'd have had to wait a total of THREE HOURS for my meal to arrive. Not once did they apologize, either.

About an hour and a half later I posted a tweet reiterating my frustrations at Magic Oven and within 2 minutes I had a call from them informing me they \"saw my tweet\" and essentially wondering what the issue was since they had \"offered me a credit,\" which I don't even want, because ordering from here again is out of the question at this point.

A word of advice to whoever is running this joint: Calling a very obviously frustrated customer at 10:30pm on a weeknight with what is essentially a poor excuse of a \"solution\" for a very poorly run business (once again, not a single apology on their end) is not the way to go about things."}
{"text":"Review for delivery only.
We ordered: 
Pan curry mushrooms
Greek salad
Seafood magic 10\" pizza
Total: $37.86

Pizza was fantastic! I didn't expect to like it but my fiancé insisted on trying it. I ordered a Greek salad as a safe bet and wish I ordered something more adventurous. Salad came with the dressing already mixed on, kind of soggy. Mushrooms were really good too, not too oily. 

Overall, we thought the price was a bit expensive for the size of the pizza but felt the salad and mushroom serving size were good. It was enough for two people. 

Another downside is delivery time, in their defence it does say 45-90 minutes wait but it still took 75 minutes. 

Order again: yes, no hesitation! Just order in advance."}
{"text":"Good quality food, large portions and friendly service. That sums up my experience of three recent visits to this restaurant. I usually order a lunch special pasta dish and it comes with a huge soup and salad, probably more food than I should eat at one go but then I only go here on days when I don't eat breakfast.

While the food here is certainly pricey in a neighbourhood that serves lunch specials for under ten dollars, this restaurant also makes specialty food that will make people on vegan or gluten-free diet as well as vegetarians happy."}
{"text":"I really do love the Magic Oven. The food is great, and there are tons of very interesting options that you can't find elsewhere. The staff members are totally awesome. They are prompt, kind, and courteous. 

The atmosphere is dim lit, but not dark. The whole place feels warm, and is great to just hang out for a couple of hours with friends, or while on a date.

I love coming back and finding something new to try, and I highly suggest anyone else try them out for a nice meal, or just a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"Glad Magic Oven Pizza has moved to the Junction! Overall, my husband and I had a good dine-in experience when going there on Saturday. It is much nicer and brighter inside than the previous restaurant. There is Green P parking at the side of the building, but we easily found street parking off of Annette.  
 
We started with the Honey-Chili Tofu Fingers ($6), thinking that they would be deep fried and coated in a sweet sauce. See the posted photo - they were thin but wide slices of tofu that were slightly sweet and maybe just marinated in a Honey-Chili sauce. They weren't crispy and had a rubbery texture. The Tandoori sauce on the side was good because without it, there would be no flavour (what can you expect of tofu though).
 
They have an interesting pizza menu, but you can also create your own. We split the Super Magic ($13) and Double Hawaiian Magic ($16). Their crust is a nice balance of crispy and soft. The toppings are pretty much to the edge, and they are pretty big for a single serving. The Super Magic was good, but not special. The cheese covered up the peppers and this seemed to make the pizza sort of soggy. The Double Hawaiian Magic was amazing. I would definitely order this one again. I was kind of worried about the roasted coconut topping, but it added more of a texture then a forefront flavour. Everything came together well - the pineapple was nice and sweet and was balanced by the bacon and parma prosciutto. Looking forward to trying Magic Oven again. There were so many different pizzas I wanted to try that sounded good."}
{"text":"The magic is gone.  

I love the spelt pasta, I really do.  And we've ordered from this location for years, but service and delivery have continued to decline.  This week's order took 2 hours ... with no apologies. When I did call to ask about the status of our order, it was chaotic and then excuse-laden.  If my order takes 2 hours to get to my house from the restaurant, the only valid excuse I want to hear is \"we thought you lived in Guelph.\"

We're fans of the food, but their exorbitant costs and lengthy and inconsistent delivery times means we'll NEVER order from here again."}
{"text":"The samosas from Magic Oven are the best I've tasted in the city. Usually, that's all I order (literally a bunch of samosas to just freeze or whatevs to save for later), but this time I decided to be adventurous and try a pizza. 

Overall I'd rate the food (and I've tried a lot of different things here) a 3.5 to 4 on a good day. Is it overpriced as fuck? Yes it is.

But my experience tonight has led me to give Magic Oven 1 star - and let me tell you why. You should read this, because it's why I'm not going to be a Magic Oven customer again, despite the amazing samosas and how yummy their grilled eggplant is. 

I ordered some pizza - it took 45 minutes to arrive, and the order was wrong. I had asked for vegan cheese, but was given regular goat's cheese, after making expressly clear on the phone that I wanted a substitution (I'm *VERY* allergic). I called back and was given some attitude. I asked for something for my trouble, and the person on the phone sassily asked me \"like what?\" I ended up receiving a slice of vegan cake, for which I am super thankful, but I honestly don't appreciate the sass. Look - YOU fucked up. I did not fuck up, I am a paying customer. Do not give me your attitude. You should offer *me* (especially as a repeat customer - though I never order pizza) something to make up for your mistake - at the very least, an apology, because I don't believe I even got one of those. 

I also would have appreciated being told at the time of ordering that choosing a particular type of crust would set me back an extra $3? The person I initially spoke with on the phone gave me the impression that everything was equal in terms of cost. 

ANYWAY. 40 minutes after calling them to tell them they'd messed up, I receive a call from the pizza delivery guy telling me he'd be at my house in ten minutes, and that I SHOULD WAIT OUTSIDE FOR HIM IN TEN MINUTES. Are you fucking KIDDING me? At this point when I get my food it will have been nearly 2 hours since I placed my order. 

Anyway, so I just got my pizza. The delivery guy calls me 10 minutes after he said he'd be outside, and hangs up immediately. I just assume it's him and head downstairs. When I open the door, he is in his car still, and only when he sees me come outside does he get out of his car. When he walks up to my door, he begins to ream me out - literally, he's YELLING at me. He asks me if it was me he spoke with on the phone, and I say yes. He asks me why I wasn't waiting outside. I say that I don't think that that is an appropriate thing to ask a customer to do, and that he was supposed to call me when he arrived. He complains at me - again, literally still raising his voice in an incredibly agitated manner - and starts again reaming me out for wasting his time and all this bullshit. Eventually I just say, \"Look, if I could just get my food, that would be great.\" I take my food. He continues to yell at me. I say, \"Look, I don't have time for this. Have a great night.\" He then yells, \"NO, I WON'T HAVE A GREAT NIGHT!\" and continues yelling profanities to himself as he walks back to his car. 

ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! I literally can't believe that this just happened. At this point I don't even *care* how good the pizza is (just had a bite, it's yummy  - not worth $30 but yummy). I don't even care how good the samosas are. I don't give a shit. Because this should NEVER have happened. I can't believe I tipped this fucking guy the first time he dropped off my food. No rational adult should act like this (and this gentleman wasn't a teenager, he was older, probably in his 50s), especially when you are representing a business to a paying customer. It ain't my fault your chefs fucked up my order dude, and I don't like it any more than you do. Don't take it out on me. SERIOUSLY. 

I've had pleasant dine-in experiences at other locations, but this experience was just fucking ridiculous. I LOVE their samosas but the unpleasantness of the customer service in this particular instance was just appalling. I'm going to have to find another pizza place to order from. I do know some other pizza spots have started to make pizzas with Daiya - watch the fuck out, Magic Oven! You ain't the only vegan-friendly pizza place in town anymore. Step up your shit or you'll lose a lot of customers who really love your concept but aren't impressed with the experience of being a customer.

EDIT: I just looked up the slice of cake they sent me on their menu - according to the menu, it ain't vegan. What the fucking fuck? A consolation prize I can't even eat without being sent to the hospital. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"A great spot for dinner with friends and a welcome change to the neighborhood. We had pizza and appetizers and everything was excellent. Definitely large enough for parties and relaxing warm and inviting atmosphere. Would definitely visit again!

PS They also have a patio!"}
{"text":"My son wanted pizza so we ended up here. Service was good and the pizza was very tasty. Some interesting drink selections available. Unfortunately we wanted to eat in, which is not available, however there are tables outside. It was a bit chilly but the delicious pizza kept us warm. Pizza was a little undercooked but delicious nonetheless. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Who: 2 kids, 1 adult
When: Fri nite, 9pm
What: pizza slice and pop - recommended by Joe Rockhead's reception staff as the place to get takeout 'za close by -  thanks Satchi

Made a call after a BlackBerry web search, drove around for a bit with my head in the clouds. Helpful, friendly, great directions (look for the lights on and sandwich board out front).

We find it, walk in and greeted warmly (as if we were one of the family). Suggestions about pizza ordering savings if you get a whole 'za rather than different slices. Total bill for 4 drinks and 4 slices (which really seem to be 8) = $24. Expensive but worth it.

The patrons were chatty and friendly! (2 of them). The staff (visible) were even more so (2 of them).

Staff suggestions about boxes for take-out and \"how can we help you to the car with this\" went above and beyond. One kid ordered Brio and we popped the tab, pulled up a straw to let the other kids try it before we had to proceed with the order - needless to say the kids loved it and we ordered another.

We'll be back for the pulled pork sandwich on the outside sandwich board.

The pizza was great (cheese, pep and black olives)  Toppings were not over the top plentiful but overall the food was great and the experience was awesome (warm, friendly and kind to the kids)"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've ordered takeout and the portions were skimped on. One salad box was only half full, another 3/4 full. Our pizza also did not look cheesy like the photos here, it was a thin piece of cardboard with the bare minimum. I don't recommend ordering from here especially as they are also really pricey. The only upside and thus 2 stars is that some of the food is quite tasty. So disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is great but delivery is slow.  Pick-up if you can.  When I spoke to a supervisor regarding the delivery issue they were very understanding and offered a discount on my current order."}
{"text":"Tasty stuff!  Pricey.  Miss the Broadview location that had varieties of slices."}
{"text":"This is HANDS DOWN the best pizza place I have ever ordered from! It beats out pizza hut, dominoes, anywhere! When I'm craving pizza, this is the place I order from. The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and organic. It might be a little more expensive than the chain pizza places, but the difference in taste and quality of the toppings is WORTH IT! 

I have tried many of the pizzas, but my favourites would have to be the Meaty Magic pizza and the BBQ Chicken Pizza. The meat toppings just have a taste about them that you cannot find anywhere else! 

Also, the greek salad has a dressing on it that I have never found anywhere else and it's amazing! The delivery is always on time and the pizza is always hot when it arrives. 
Yum!"}
{"text":"A little expensive, but always great quality!!! Lots of options, vegan and vegetarian friendly, gluten free...healthy! Service is always friendly, and fast!"}
{"text":"Ordered the meaty magic pizza here. The toppings were good and you can tell it was fresh but it wasn't really that amazing.   As someone who's eaten pizza everywhere from Italy to Pizza Pizza I feel that this was simply average. While I do enjoy thin crust pizza the crust wasn't crispy at all. It was really soft, which is fine for a thicker dough, but unusual for thin crust.

And the price is waaaaaay too expensive. After tax and tip it was $32 for a medium pizza of 6 slices. I understand it's organic but the size was way too small for the price.  Shouldn't have shared it between 2 people. I was still hungry! Won't be coming back here...unless they cut the price in half."}
{"text":"Ordered Delivery and got here very fast (under 30 minutes!).    You have to order the Wings.  They were so tasty.   Also recommend the pizza with the spelt crust.   Very flavourful pizza.  Both the pizza and wings were not oily either as others have mentioned.   

Probably the only place around here that offers lactose free, gluten free and vegan options all at one place."}
{"text":"Had a wicked lunch today at the Magic Oven at the Scadding Court community center modular marketplace. 

A chicken Tandoori sloppy bunjo (basically a giant sloppy joe but filled with chicken tandoori, onions, cilantro, and hot sauce) and some samosas for about 7$. It was way more than enough and I hadn't eaten breakfast (aND I EAT LIKE A PIG, REALTALK).

So it was inexpensive, interesting, tasty, and I'll be back. There's a bit of seating along the sidewalk, but I think it's more of a grab n' go type of spot. 

Looked like they had corn on the cob, indian iced tea, and different versions of sloppy bunjos (including vegan). 

PS
Does the 'T' in tandoori get capitalized?"}
{"text":"Sometimes it doesn't matter whether a company has a good product if the service sucks. I was at a friend's house, maybe a 10minute walk or 2 minute drive from Magic Oven. We ordered a pizza, and more than 80 minutes later, no pizza. When we called to inquire we got attitude from the guy on the phone.

I don't ask for a ton from my pizza places but I do expect that when I order pizza it gets there in a reasonable time and if not, a certain amount of humility when we call to inquire. 80 minutes is a long time to wait for a pizza that is coming from a place that is 2 minutes away. And in this city, there are a lot of options for pizza."}
{"text":"Got delivery for Harmonic Magic, didn't have any arugula on it even though they advertise it as having it. Overall, pretty dry pizza and definitely not worth 40 dollars! Don't buy this trash"}
{"text":"We ordered the 'good n green' pizza. Delivery. It came in the expected time period (about 45min i think). The veggies were not cooked- the broccoli and zucchini were fully raw. The cheese was supposed to be feta but it was their light mozzarella. The sauce was salty. It was as if they cooked the bread, put all the toppings on and had it sit in the oven for maybe a minute (at best). We actually put it in the oven then ate it. We called them immediately and told them the situation- the girl on the phone didn't seem to care and said that we'll get 30% off our next order. A really bs offer given that we had to eat raw pizza! I wish we had just stayed with frozen pizza especially given the price tag!!!"}
{"text":"I love the Magic Oven! The pizza is delicious and it is great if you have friends who have food sensitivities because you can get gluten free and vegan options. I of course done get them but a few of my friends were very impressed with the options they have. This place is near my work and I have always had good friendly service when I go.  I recommend the BBQ chicken pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good. It's not stone or wood oven quality in terms of cooking flavor. The ingredient they use are higher quality. Overall it was up to my expectations. I also order their fries, which are actually fantastic.

I recommend this place to anyone who likes good pizza. I just wished they server lasagna."}
{"text":"I ordered a kale hummus wrap that was supposed to come with fresh and roasted veggies. I got a ciabbatta bun with tasteless hummus spread on it and arugula (not kale!). The fresh veggies were some cherry tomatoes cut in half. The roasted veggies consisted of just some sautéed onions. It was disgusting. I ate a few tomatoes and threw it out."}
{"text":"This place has pretty decent vegan options and the menu itself isn't too overwhelming. The veggie samoas and kale chickpea dip were great appetizers. The Vegan Magic pizza was delicious. I could have passed on the Coconut Lime cake. It was a bit too heavy and dry for me. Service was quick and attentive. I would definitely go back to try more of the menu, both vegan and regular options!"}
{"text":"I don't really get the hype about this place. I am into the whole eating healthy thing and they definitely have lots of gluten free, vegan and veggie options. The decor is nothing special and it wasn't very busy for a Saturday night. I ordered the green curry chicken penne and my boyfriend had the lamb and spinach penne. I love thai food and was excited to try something different. I felt the best part about my meal was the garlic bread and it wasn't even that good. The pasta had way too much cilantro in it and the chicken was so so. We heard the waitress speaking to another table about a special that they were featuring with a prix fixe meal for $20 bucks. She was very thorough telling them all about it and it sounded very delicious, but by this time we already had our food and were never even told about it. I can't stand when not everyone gets the same treatment. Why didn't see feel the need to tell us about the deal, who knows. Won't be back, can find better pasta and thai food else where."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from here for my work lunch. 

Overall it's a very salty Hawaiian pizza. Not really worth the price and it was slightly burnt. 

Co-worker had chicken special 
Crust was soggy. Too many toppings and it fell apart.

Another co-worker had the sausage. Similar disappointment on flavour, crust. 

Overall would not eat again."}
{"text":"I live in the area and eat out about 10 times a week, so I know what I like - and I really like Magic Oven. Amazing range of handmade, gourmet pizza, great jazz on Saturday nights and all you can eat on Wednesdays ... plus a hidden gem of a patio out back."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza from here this weekend.  Delivery time was not great, they took an hour from the time we called it in to the time they were at the door.

I actually thought the pizza was okay, but I can't give it more than 2 stars for the price they charge.  It's better than Pizza Pizza, but come on, that's faint praise.  For the amount they charge they've got to do better."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place doesn't have at least a four star. 

I came here on a Monday night and it was very empty. I took a long time scrolling through the menu because there were a lot of options between the sandwiches, pasta, and pizza. They offer a lot of vegetarian options, gluten-free, organic, you know, the vegan works. Anyway, I ordered a custom pizza with grilled chicken, spinach, organic mozzarella, portobello mushrooms, and eggplant.

And it was so good! The pizza was not too thin and had a crispy crust. The chicken was tender and don't get me started on the eggplant: crispy skin and soft centre. The pizza was a good size and I was filled after (although I'm sure some would complain it's too small but I don't think so). I was delightfully surprised. Definitely would come back in the future.

P.S. I had no problems with service. Our waitress was nice. She was new and she was being trained."}
{"text":"Pro's: healthy, lots of vegan options, non-vegan options for your meat-eater friends. they have timely delivery. I really like the grain 'n' green salad. lots of gluten-free options!

con's: super expensive so i only get it when my company is paying for it. The quality has gone down a bit over the last few years. the salad i really like used to have tomatoes and cucumber and now its just lettuce. the Beets are no good."}
{"text":"I've had bad experiences with other Magic Oven's in Toronto, but this one is really nice. The food is good, it's cozy and nice looking inside, and they have TONS of gluten-free options (including pasta, bread for sandwiches, and desserts). It's my go-to lunch place when I'm meeting a friend near my work - the only downside is service tends to be a little slow at lunch (you'll sit forever waiting for the bill if you don't flag your waitress and ask!)"}
{"text":"When you decide to go out to a restaurant to enjoy a nice meal, you're looking for more than food quality. You're looking for a place with a nice atmosphere, you're looking for friendly and honest staff, and of course, you're looking for delicious food that'll leave you radiantly plump for a good price. On Thursday evening I was absolutely starving and decided to grab a bite to eat in the Junction. I had heard of Magic Oven before but never had the chance to dine there.  As I pulled up to the parking lot I saw the sign outside that read \"$5 House Wine\" and I knew I had come to the right place. 

The server who greeted me was delightful, she got me a big bottle of water and menu's right away. I was impressed with the selection of drinks and their paired prices, very affordable! The food menu was equally as splendid, and when my eyes glazed over the \"Three appetizers for $11\" option, I nearly began to weep (Three! For $11!). I ordered the Beets in Lemon, Veggie Samosas, and Rustic Potato Fries, right away. I then ordered the Tandoori Chicken Pasta because, gluttony. 

The appetizers came out together on an endearing plate adorned with garnish. Everything smelled amazing and the portions were bigger than I had anticipated. The Beet Salad was by far my favorite (although note that I am biased and love beet everything). I can honestly say out of all of the beet salads I've eaten in various restaurants in my life, Magic Oven nailed it. It was cold, and refreshing, and perfectly boiled, with a hint of lemon. I enjoyed every bite. The Veggie Samosas really surprised me, as an avid carnivore I never give much chance to anything labeled \"veggie\" but boy am I glad I did. They were absolutely scrumptious, and the sauce they came with was magnificent (honestly I would have drank it with a straw had I not been in public, it's that good). The Rustic Potato Fries were hot and delicious and perfectly tender on the inside.  I didn't think I would make it to the Tandoori Chicken, but when it arrived it's aroma beckoned me and I just couldn't say no. It was warm and saucey and smelled like heaven. The chicken was perfect, not dry at all. The pasta was great, and the sauce was just the right amount of spicy. Since I ordered with my hungry eyes, I was way too full to consume everything in one sitting. However the server sweetly packaged all my leftovers (and even gave me another samosa sauce, that angel) and I left very full and very satisfied. I loved everything about Magic Oven and will definitely return! 

PS If you log in to Yelp, they give you a complimentary dessert! Huge surprise: it was delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza & service was great. I will most definitely return to enjoy some pizza or perhaps indulge in another item on the menu."}
{"text":"I used to work for magic oven waaaay back in the day (different location) and I must say things have downgraded. 

I ordered a medium pesto chicken pizza and substituted the spelt crust for the white. I used to love their spelt crust, it added substance and had a nice grainy flavour to it. But I was so sad to I notice that their spelt crust is substantially thinner, same taste but less filling. It looked like a thin crust pizza. Also, as good as the pizza tasted, it was way too oily. I imagine the oil is coming from the pesto as I can't imagine oil coming out of any other topping. And if it is, whoever is preparing the pizza doesn't know how to base the pizza. It's as if the base of a bit of pesto, and lots of oil. I don't know about you, but when I'm ordering a pizza with a pesto base, I'm looking for the pesto flavour, not the oil the pesto is in."}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with the good and green magic pizza. Yummmmmm!!! If you want real, healthy, tasty pizza, then this is the place to be. I will not have pizza anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"I was going to get McDonald's. That should put you in my head alright. I was in a mood for what I knew. Giant diet cola, double big mac, fries coming out my ears. But Kent P said that there were sloppy joes made of Indian food. I was torn, stick with something old that works or try something new.

Man alive, Magic Oven is the new old. There's something very comforting and nostalgic about the sloppy joe. Just a regular old hamburger bun with some awesome sauce in there. But Magic Oven blew my mind with how well put together (and delicious) everything was. The curry is fantastic and the chicken slices moist and succulent. He even tossed on a chili pepper for me to give it some extra kick. And what's even more amazing is that it held together okay. Is Tony one of those awesome Indian guys with a PhD in engineering who is applying his skills to making indestructible sandwiches? Hopefully not, that's kind of depressing, but the meal was really good. The sandwich and a whole other meal of samosas (3 for $3) came to a grand total of $8. $8 for a lunch that actually would have put me to sleep at my desk if I didn't use a standup desk (like Hemingway and Churchill - essentially it's an invitation to be a drunk). 

All in all a huge find for Kent P and easily one of my top new restaurants around.

Note: the tables are all along the sidewalk so it's a bit crammed. Food to go is a better way to do it, although there's nowhere to sit within walking distance that isn't crowded with drunks or punk ass kids, so it's imperfect when it comes to location."}
{"text":"Chose this place to eat while hungry and caught in the rain. Was pretty cute, kind of eclectic, sort of a weird location. Yummy food. Good bar drinks. Super foreign staff but very kind and genuine.. The pizza selection is awesome, and priced pretty well too. Preferred my boyfriends simple meat pizza over my goat cheese fig pizza though, found the figs pretty dry and hard to chew. If you're looking for pizza in this area, go to Vesuvio's"}
{"text":"Great gluten free and vegetarian options. I love their mobile app, you can build, order and pay for your pizza in one fell swoop :)"}
{"text":"firstly - and its big - i've NEVER dealt directly with this place, so can't speak AT ALL for their customer service. we order through 'orderit' so i don't have to actually talk to a real, live person. i'm usually tired when i get to ordering, and don't have the energy to deal. reading below, it sounds like i've been making the right decision. (and they're lucky i have - i do not abide poor service. seriously).

that said, another oft used complaint below is about the price. and i'll jump on that band wagon super fast. it IS crazy expensive, but i completely rationalize it. this is fresh, healthy food that has always tasted great when we've ordered.

pizzas - small size is perfect for one person, but once you start adding stuff, be careful. one of my kids likes it plain - easy-peasy. the other kid just cost me $22 for a single serve pizza. that's crazy talk. but again - they taste great. no leftovers, even from my skinny-can't-believe-how-little-he-eats kid. 

salads - lordy. delish. unfortunately, if you want a meal size, once again the cost becomes slightly prohibitive. 

other stuff - the chicken wings are pretty dang good. not as good as 'horribly bad for you, but so yummy' ones you get elsewhere. but for a reason - they're not as horribly bad for you. the trade off is totally worth it. i usually get a couple small plates (appies) instead of a full meal - a soup, some garlic greens, etc. - and they're always fresh.

so, sum out is a hodge podge. ordering through a 3rd party means i don't suffer from poor customer service, the prices are high, but the food is good. and i don't suffer the working mom's guilt about ordering in yet another meal for my kids since its all pretty high quality, fresh and healthy. 

take this as you will!"}
{"text":"My wife and I passed by this place a few weeks back. Pizza and beer? That sounds awesome, right?! Confession: I am a complete pizza SNOB. Although I do not snuff chains as long as the quality and value is good.

We decided to try it out about a week ago. I cannot believe how highly rated this place is, because it was a very disappointing experience.

My wife ordered their BBQ Chicken Magic pizza and I ordered the Gourmet Meaty Magic pizza. I had a Big Wheel Amber to drink as I love Amsterdam beer.

They screwed up my order. Our waitress thought I'd ordered the Meaty Magic. Even though I was absolutely famished, I sent it back immediately. The cook threw on the missing ingredients and threw it back in the oven. Lame. 

While waiting, I had a bite of my wife's pizza. The sauce tasted like ketchup...way too sweet. The crust is terrible. It is floppy, chewy and not the least bit crunchy. It also doesn't taste like anything. No savoury yeasty flavour, no unctuous, satisfying chew. NOTHING. These pizzas are about 10\" in diameter. How are you supposed to feel full on such a PUNY PIZZA?!?!?!!!!!

My pizza showed up, and it too was nothing to write home about. Sauce that is simply way too sweet, boring crust, and the rest of the toppings weren't anything to rejoice over either. Artichoke hearts, spinach, garlic, prosciutto, salami...this is supposed to be an AWESOME pizza! This was an 18 DOLLAR PIZZA. For $18, a large pizza from a chain like Dominos or 2 4 1 is much better in flavour AND value! We paid well over $50 for two pizzas, and a beer. This is absurd!

You downtown Toronto hipsters wouldn't know good quality, flavourful pizza if it bit you in the ass! If you want truly incredible pizza, Amadios Pizza in Port Credit while a little pricey, has the best pizza I've ever had growing up in Mississauga. My second favourite is Lombardi's Pizza in NYC, followed by Keste also in NYC.

Do not waste your time here unless you like paying out your ass for boring, bland, trendy pizza."}

Pizza: good B+

Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Had the Greek salad and pasta with spinach, chicken, sun dried tomatoes, and some other stuff forget what its called now but it was great. Food came pretty fast, only complaint was it's a little pricey for pasta and a salad came up to 50 for the two of us. Which is all right, but I'm used to getting a lot more food for that price. All around a good place, definitely consider coming back after my hair cuts at Hair District two doors down."}
{"text":"Deffinetly try the spelt flower crust it is amazing and extremely healthy, digests better than any flower and tastes delicious i loved this place its amazing i will deffinetly be going their again"}
{"text":"This place is consistently good. My work orders in from them on a regular basis for the ease of a very broad range of menu items when trying to appease lots of people. Their pizzas are unique and delicious, and you can't beat a place that does nothin but organic! Their edamame is a good snack too."}
{"text":"Took my family here for lunch.  It's great because they cater to all crowds.  We had a couple of vegetarians, a person who is lactose & egg intolerant, and 2 meat lovers.  We all left with full stomachs and smiles.

Beers on tap here are great! We had a pumpkin spiced beer, and it was delicious.

Service was perfect, he couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"I ordered a 10-inch gluten free vegan pizza. It had kale, daiya (dairy free cheese) and sun dried tomatoes. In my opinion, it was a bit dry but still delicious. 
The only downside about this place is the price. Its a bit expensive. 
Overall, it was still a good experience. But I'll only come back once in a while due to the price."}
{"text":"If your looking for a great thin crust pizza this is the place to visit.A very impressive choice of thin crust pizzas,organic gluten free crusts and again with many options.The Magic Oven caters to are more healthy approach to eating, which is nice to see.The only complaint I have was a Caesar I ordered it's was billed as hot and sour with a touch of cumin, it was bland and tasteless and over priced at $9. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"This Magic Oven location is a nice compromise between fancy restaurant and diner-feel. The narrow, deep restaurant just across from Dupont subway station is pretty understated with its décor - it's clean and simple, some nice exposed brick walls and a rotating selection of art/photography on display. (A word of warning, it can get a little chilly in there - overcompensating in the summer months, at least). 

After a recent menu revamp, there's been a bunch of additions to the menu - but you can still expect to find the great variety of salads, sandwiches, pasta and pizza as always. One fantastic addition for vegans/dairy-intolerant is the introduction of Daiya vegan cheese, which is a vegan pizza's BFF - melty, stretchy, delicious!

Appetisers are a mix of soups and tapas-style small plates - the garlic bread and potato wedges are terrific, but watch out not to spoil your appetite with too much starchy (ohhh delicious starch) indulgence. 


I'm a sucker for anything with olives even remotely involved, so the 'Mediterranean Magic' pizza is one of my favourites (the smallest size is definitely enough for one) - and like any of their vegetarian pizzas, it can be made vegan just by asking; Magic Oven are very helpful when it comes to this. 

Beers and wine (some local) are available as well as pop - with a few more interesting options like fruity organic spritzers and my favourite pizza companion, Brio. Desserts are kept to a simple selection of cakes - to Magic Oven's merit they do offer a few vegan and/or gluten free options, so if you've managed to leave enough room after your appetisers and/or mains, then there should be more than enough choice to keep you happy and sugared up. 

Prices are obviously not at the level of grabbing a slice from one of Toronto's many cheap pizza chains, but I think that the extra cost is worth it for the quality and variety of food, and the ability to satisfy a table that might have a vegan, vegetarian, celiac and a meat-eater all at the same time.

Service here is always pretty reasonable and friendly, and I've not been kept waiting an unreasonably long time even when the restaurant is semi-full. I can't speak to the delivery service, I prefer to go out to Magic Oven locations. I have gotten takeaway, and they were pretty prompt.

I used to feel this was 3 stars, but thanks to the more comprehensive menu offerings pizza/pasta-wise now, and their use of the Daiya vegan cheese, this slighty upscale pizza joint is worth the 4."}
{"text":"They've got the same menu as the other Magic Oven locations but this Liberty Village location is more take-out, less sit-in.

Sometimes I feel like you need a puppy dressed in Burberry to eat at Magic Oven.  Why am I spending THIS much money on pizza again?  Why do they have a $100 pizza that has GOLD FLAKES on it?  It's all a bit over-the-top, no?

Something pulls me back every once in a while though.  Their Tandoori Chicken Pizza is pretty awesome, and the Green and Grain Salad is fantastic.  

Very pricey, feels healthy enough to be sort of almost worth it.  If you hit it once, you'll probably hit it again."}
{"text":"Magic Oven's Keele street location truly strives for quality food and exceptional customer service. Magic Oven's menu consists of several quality organic pizzas and satisfying pastas. i recommend the Harmony Magic pizza for a solid mix of veggies and meat. The Balance Pasta is a great pasta dish that always hits the spot.  

The organic spritzers, especially the raspberry lemonade, are insanely refreshing and flavorful. The pure fruit purée is present in every sip and even though they come in cans, the carbonation is minimal.   The cheesecakes are a phenomenal guilty pleasure. I recommend the white chocolate blueberry and hazelnut cheesecake slices. 

They are pricey at $6 a slice but but you truly get what you pay for and I mean that in the best possible way. You can really taste that fresh, rich cappuccino flavour in the cappuccino cheesecake and the white chocolate cheesecake is a phenomenal blend of blueberry and white chocolate.  

Very good beer selection on tap. no Molson Canadian or Coors Light or Budweiser here. The Keele Magic Oven's on tap beer selection consists of only premium quality beers such ad McAuslan oatmeal stout, steam whistle, and maple brook premium organic lager. Currently, there is a phenomenal $8 slice of pizza and pint of any beer daily special. 

Slices are massive and a Magic Oven small pizza is about the size of a medium sized pizza from similar pizzaerias such as Dominos or Pizza Pizza but is superior due to a variety of crusts including gluten free crusts and fresh organic toppings. 

The environment is a very causal environment with very comfortable lounge bench and sofa seating. Background music often consists of a solid mix of classical music such as four seasons by Vivaldi or some very upbeat lounge jazz.  In closing, the Keele st Magic Oven is a very nice upscale, family friendly restaurant. Magic Oven makes a great addition to the Keele junction area and I look forward to going there often for years to come."}
{"text":"Perfectly serviceable food for after work gatherings or with people you don't know that well. Decent beer and wine specials and a lot of variety on the menu(sandwiches), pizza and pasta. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options. 

Service and decor were also serviceable. Not the kind of place to come back to for anything outstanding but a decent place in a pinch."}
{"text":"The pizza here is disappointing and over-priced. I really wanted to like Magic Oven due to the availability of spelt crust and the interesting vegetarian selections. 

The crust (spelt, whole wheat, and regular) all seem to have the same consistency, that of cardboard. The pizza sauce is either too sour or tasteless depending on the pizza I've chosen. Once or twice the veggies on the pizza have had a rubbery feel to them - definitely didn't taste fresh.

All of that PLUS their incredibly high prices means there is absolutely no reason to visit Magic Oven unless you require their gluten-free alternative and are too busy to make it yourself or pick one up from Whole Foods."}
{"text":"This place is a good chain in my book. It had good deals and combos for pizza and pints. Not out of this world or anything but it is a good place for a quick bite and beer and the deals are well worth it."}
{"text":"I've rolled by the Magic Oven probably hundreds of times on the Queen Streetcar. I always caught my eye, but I didn't live in the area, and just never gave it a try.

I'm SO happy that we decided to pop in here at the beginning of summer for a bite to eat and a drink. It's now our favourite place to go in the neighbourhood.

First of all let me say, that if the weather is nice make sure you go right through to the patio in the back. It's a nice little hidden gem with lovely trees and twinkle lights.
I was just expecting pizza and a pint, but it's so much more than that. 

FOOD: 
The menu is really quite diverse. Appetizers like samosas, edamame, soup or greek fries. The greek fries come with a yummy dipping sauce too. The are salads, wraps, pastas and pizza. Of course... pizza. My friends have tried the gluten free crust and really enjoyed it (their fave is the prana magic). I just have the regular crust and it's great. So many choices, it's amazing! Lots of cheese options (my fave) and even vegan cheese, if you're into that. They have some scrumptious looking desserts as well. 

DRINK: 
Full bar here but i recommend the beer and wine mostly. Friends have had a couple mixed drinks, and while they were good, they seemed kinda small for the price.

I've popped in a few times on a Saturday and there was some wicked live music playing in the front. 

See you there :)"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to this particular location of Magic Oven. 
I'm a super duper fan of the one at Queen & Parliament (wine and beer!) so I wanted to give this one a shot. 
They have a cute little spot on Jefferson with some tables inside and a couple picnic tables outside in the shade of some trees if you want to enjoy your pizza there. But you can also take away or have it delivered. The pizza was yummy and even though I didn't see my fave 'Uber Meaty Magic' on the menu, when I asked about it they knew what I was talking about and made it for me. 
I just wish they had their license to serve beer and wine and a bit better atmosphere (like the Queen and Parliament location) and I'd be there every week for sure!"}
{"text":"The pizza is actually pretty good here and it's made of natural ingredients which my friend told me but I still don't think it makes Pizza healthy but healthier than other places.

The ambiance is rusty and well done. Seating is spacious and service was courteous and friendly. Good place to go eat.

We had the BBQ Chicken Magic, we got a large which was enough for both of us. It was good and flavourful. It was made to perfection with delicious juicy flavour.

Overall it's a good place to relax with friends or take a date/girlfriend.

{"text":"Pretty rattled.  Ordered delivery from this location over the phone, seemed pretty easy.  Got edamame and a summer salad thing ($30).  When I got it delivered I had to walk outside to pay for my meal (whatever it happens). Went up to my room to eat some grub before studying and look what they forgot - SALAD DRESSING.  You'd think paying $30 for a \"personal salad\" (which by the way looks more like a side salad) and edamame with nothing special on it and a 15% tip they'd at least remember the damn salad dressing.   I call and am like what the heck and they're like oh so sorry $5 off your next order.  You mean my next $30 order of a side salad w/o dressing and plain edamame (I can buy a bag for $4 ok). Ya I don't think so.  This salad tastes like shit without dressing.  I ordered a salad online because I wanted to spice up my dressing and not just have plain old olive oil or greek or whatever I usually have in my fridge.  This was a waste of money.  So done.

also side note.  I open my Kambucha drink and it fizzes all over the place so im like oh my god i need napkins where are they?!?!?! NO. NAPKINS. GIVEN. $30 MEAL WITH NO NAPKINS.  R U KIDDING ME."}
{"text":"Had the edameme and their harmony magic pizza (our waitress' recommendation btw!). Bloody awesome. Tres delicious. What made it better was that we attended a play, afterwards, in their basement! It is the Coal Mine Theatre. Like our meal, the play was equally awesome! Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"A review for LGBTQ diners:
I have enjoyed going to other Magic Oven locations but was extremely disappointed by how we were treated at this restaurant. All through our meal we could hear men in the kitchen talking about us, about whether or not we're \"lesbians\" and our genders.

Even though I live around the corner and love pizza (and the Junction lacks vegan options!), we won't be returning. I'm not going to pay to have my date ruined and my spirits kicked."}
{"text":"Super inconsistent. I order the same thing every now and then as something different and healthy for lunch, and never know what kind of veggies are going to be thrown in there or how it will be prepared. Magic Oven prices are expensive! So between those two things, it's not really worth it. The owner/manager is really nice and customer service is good."}
{"text":"Tried the Euphoria Magic pizza a few months back... I had tried their Downtown Core location about a year prior and it was good, not great.  I like the Danforth location the best.

Pizza was great, mine came out a little cold but I didn't bother to send it back.  I like that this place is different, as they offer a variety of pizza choices.  Ask for the pizza to be cooked well-done if you don't want it to come out practically raw.  The reason I gave this joint 4 stars as opposed to the 5 is that I thought the pizza was slightly expensive."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but was overpriced. Feels run down and old. Service was acceptable."}
{"text":"Came here to catch the [free!] comedy night they feature Wednesdays. I don't live too far away and had always wondered about this place. 

Well, wonder no more 'cause I'll be back! (Probably) 

Only reason there is any hesitance whatsoever is because the dining service during the show was practically non existent which is odd to me. They're not charging cover for the show so, the server should be fairly attentive to try to sell/upsell food/bevy to ring up sales. She was nowhere to be found and I eventually got up, located her and got her to come to the table. I strongly dislike chasing servers so this is a HUGE negative point for me. 

Once she was flagged down, I ordered a mystery drink (\"Surprise me!\") which was a raspberry lemonade with gin - yum! 

Food - vegan pizza with daiya cheese, tomato, peppers and pineapple, and I added chicken because I wanted to (yup, they let me!) 

This pizza was straight up AMAZING. I usually have to drown all my pizzas in ranch to be able to enjoy them (dead taste buds FTW) - not necessary! All the toppings were so juicy and fresh and the crust just slightly crunchy (but not over cooked), it was an experience. 

And - the show wasn't bad either! The host (Nisha) was lovely and all the comics were all very different and lively in their own way. Had some kneeslapping moments for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better ones. The pizza can be shitty sometimes, not enough cheese, kinda cold usually but all the salads and soups are great! Delivery is either CRAZY fast or CRAZY slow......."}
{"text":"I normally order from the junction location, mostly bc I didn't know this one existed. Kale caesar is definitely better from the junction. My 9$ side salad was off. Really off."}
{"text":"I didn't get a chance to eat anything, I came for a friend's birthday party. Service at the bar was quick and super friendly. The place had a great vibe for hanging out with friends. I had an awesome time!"}
{"text":"Got a vegan pizza (without daiya), it was great! So fresh, although mine was slightly undercooked with a doughy middle. I'm sure that was a fluke. I'll be back eventually!"}
{"text":"I had the bbq tofu ciabatta with spinach sandwich. OMG, it was gooood! 
There's a nice patio out back and the waiter was really friendly. 
It took a little while to get served, but once we ordered the food came relatively quickly. 
Being mid-day, the waiter was on his own, so it's no wonder it took a while to serve us. 
The sandwich was so yummy it didn't matter. 
Decently priced, as well. 
Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Like the alternative choices this restaurant offers for pizza.  Few pizza places offer spelt crust and even fewer offer seared salmon (most have smoked). And if you want something vegan?  Not only do you have vegan \"cheese,\" but there's also tofu. I'd like to see build-your-own pastas and tempeh, though."}
{"text":"The worse experience! While visiting Toronto we stop at this place to have dinner. They have a natural/organic vibe. We order the Tandoori Chicken Magic Pizza. It was horrible, I like spicy food and it was so spicy and horrible that we could not eat it. I told the waiter that I didn't like it and she asked the manager. The solution they offered was to dip the pizza in BBQ sauce so we could eat it!!!! It was the worse service I have ever received in my life. We didn't eat it they never offered a different dish. It was like \"you can eat it or leave it there, we don't care if you like it or not.\" They brought me a check for $35 for a horrible pizza that I didn't eat and never tried to make amendments.   Avoid this place. Horrible."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. Ordered twice from them over the last 2 months and both times been huge disappointment. Sauces are becoming increasingly watery and extremely salty. Burnt pasta, apparently that's possible and stuck together. Salad ingredients not fresh either. Sadly not any good."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here on UberEats for New Years, with a few friends. I ordered the Mediterranean (feta, sundried tomatoes, black olives), and my other friend got the vegan potato pizza. The service was quick, so they deserve two stars, however the pizza itself was not good at all. My friends pizza (the vegan potato pizza) was very sweet (I think they put nutmeg on it?) she ate two slices & couldn't finish it. My pizza was OK. The toppings were a bit stale, certainly not fresh. And the crust for both our pizzas was very thin and hard. When we received the pizza most of the slices were actually broken in half down the middle! It would have been okay, but it cost 40$ for 2 medium pizzas which were definitely not worth the price. I'm happy to pay extra if I know the food will be great, and I could not have been more disappointed. 

I hate to leave a bad review, as I had been so excited to try them for a while, and I loved that they had a set vegan and vegetarian pizzas. However, we were all very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've already wanted to try this place, and now with my dietary restrictions, this seems the perfect time. 

After looking at their menu and surprised to see how expensive it was ($14-18 for a pasta, not including spelt pasta substitutions) and a pizza ($12-17 for a small).  They also have a pizza that starts at $10 and you can pick your own toppings, but for a cost.  

I was going to get a $12 (1 person 4 slice) pizza, but then the guy told me it would take 10 mins. I didn't feel like waiting, and wish that I had ordered it before going to Shopper's.  He coaxed me into staying and getting something by saying that pasta would be faster. 

I chose the spelt pasta for $15.  Seems a bit steep.  The portion was quite big though.  It was tasty, but there was a strange after taste.  I also felt like the tomato, broccoli spelt pasta I could have made at home. 

After I saw  that Live Organic Bar also is right beside serving pasta for $6.99.....
HMMMM.

Food is okay, but pricey."}
{"text":"Oh, yummy yummy yum yum. I've never eaten in at Magic Oven, but I sure have taken out. Many, many times. I love the pasta - fresh noodles, plenty of spicy sauce and cheese only if you want it. It comes with a generous portion of butter-soaked garlic bread and, if you're carb-friendly, I recommend skipping the side salad and opting for the oven-baked fries, instead. You'll feel full like Thanksgiving after a Magic Oven meal!"}
{"text":"The napa salmon salad was excellent.  

The vegetable samosa we got was OK except the potatoes inside were still frozen.  Returned it and got back a burned samosa instead - at least it wasn't frozen.

Service was poor.  The two waitresses were too busy talking with each other to pay us any attention.  Had to walk up to the counter twice to get service."}
{"text":"Pizza is boring. Topping selection is good though. But waited 2.5 hours for delivery. Was told it was my fault for ordering delivery, should have come in. Unacceptable service especially for such over priced food. One pound of wings, two large pizzas and 4 pops was $95 with delivery. Go to king slice!"}
{"text":"Good eats!!!  Pizza was great and being raised in Chicago I'm a harsh critic.  Didn't think is was over priced.  I had soup, a beer and a pizza, it was $25.  I left w/ plenty of leftovers for a second meal too! YUMMIES!"}
{"text":"Spending the weekend with my fiancee we found ourselves unable to decide what we wanted to eat for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  She reminded me that we had seen a menu for this place on my last visit and we said we could try it someday. Well, someday was that Saturday.  We arrived mid-day and noticed that there was no one in the restaurant save another couple.  The servers were happy to seat us and were very attentive/willing to answer all of our questions. I decided on their Double Hawaiian Pizza (medium) and my fiancee' got an appetizer whose name has escaped my mind at the moment. It had chick peas and a curry sauce with some more veggies. Long story short. She adored her food, she ate it all with love  like a kid with their favorite candy. My pizza was excellent. Shaved coconut, ham, fresh pineapple pieces of bacon and melted mozzarella cheese.   Tasty, made well, good flavor. We both highly enjoyed our meals and will come back again if we cannot decide where to go."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but way too pricey.  We had a small pizza, pasta dish, and each a Ceasar salad.  The bread crumbs were stale and there was nothing fancy or special about the salad.  The pasta was delicious!  Cooked perfectly with a fragrant and flavorful sauce.  The pizza was above average, but the sauce was a little tart."}
{"text":"Food was okay, server was nice. But our bottle of wine was watery and tasted completely off. They would not do anything about it. What a waste, it was atrocious!"}
{"text":"The most important thing to note before going to Magic Oven at Queen and Parliament is that they don't seem to have A/C.  A group of my friends and myself got together in the recent \"feels like\" 43 degree Toronto heat and sweltered throughout our meal.  The ice in our water melted in minutes.  Consider this your warning.  If you can get over that, this is a great place to meet, hangout, and eat some great food.

As a group we've been encouraging each other to be healthier.  This meant that our weekly pub grub meet-ups fell by the wayside as we all worked on watching our waistlines.  Not wanting to give up being social all together, we searched for an option that would make everyone happy.  Lucky for us Magic Oven has organic ingredients and healthy options (in addition to an entire bar of delicious sounding adult beverages) which seemed to appease everyone in our group.

We went on a Wednesday night without even realizing that Wednesday is their unlimited pizza and salad night.  For about $15 you can order any of their pizzas (minus the seafood and their signature pizza) and get a side salad (Caesar or green).  You can then keep on ordering as many as you can eat until 9:00.  Not a bad deal, considering most of their pizzas start at $12-$14.  Plus, they let you take home the leftovers, which is more than I can say about some other all-you-can-eat places.

I got their version of a Hawaiian pizza, which came topped with bacon, prosciutto, coconut (!), and pineapple.  I opted for a gluten-free crust ($2 extra) and dairy-free Daiya cheese (included in the price).  I didn't opt for the special, because I knew I wouldn't be eating more than one pizza.  Plus, my boyfriend doesn't touch anything of the leafy green variety, so I nibbled at some of his Caesar salad.

The salad was a disappointment.  The one listed as an entree on the menu comes with croutons and bacon bits, and is served with kale.  This one is just dressing smothered romaine.  Plus, the heat had made the leaves a bit wilty, so it was unappetizing.  Thankfully, the pizza was delicious.  The gluten-free crust tasted delicious and had a nice crunch to it.  The toppings worked well together, and I barely ate half the pizza before I was too full to continue.

Our waitress was efficient - almost too efficient.  She memorized all of our orders (including all our specific requests) without writing anything down, and would refill drinks and other requests really quickly.  However, there were a couple times where we would request something and she'd be off getting that item/drink before anyone else could even open their mouth.  In the end, everyone got everything they wanted, it just cost her a few extra trips back and forth.

The food quality is very high, but great quality comes at a cost.  Since I didn't get the special and added the gluten-free crust, my pizza came to $18.  After tax and tip, it was almost $25 for a 10\" pizza and a glass of water.  Kind of pricey, and definitely not an everyday sort of thing.

However, given the wide variety of items and their allergy-inclusive menu items, I have no doubt that we will make Magic Oven a regular stop."}
{"text":"The food is fine. The portion is not right. For the price the portion is way too small. And no gluten free hype can justify that."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ventured out of the house on search for a warm and cozy place to eat. Thankfully, I ventured all the way to the Junction and found Magic Oven. I had actually never eaten at a Magic Oven before. Normally I order delivery. 

The great thing about eating at the restaurant is that it is fully licensed and sells everything from beer to mixed cocktails.  If you go on a Sunday, they have a $5 Caesar special. I ordered this and just loved the pickle garnish and classic Caesar spicy flavours. 

I was incredibly hungry so I decided to order the Power Soup and the Rainforest Magic 12 inch pizza (6 slices). 

The Power Soup (price $6) was a hearty mix of chickpeas, kale, celery, onions, and carrot cooked in a light vegetable broth. It was both comforting and full of flavour. 

The Rainforest Magic had a unique ingredient list that blended quite well. The pizza was made with tomato sauce and topped with caramelized onions, fresh spinach leaves, dried figs, and melted mozzarella. It was a savoury blend that delivered on taste and satisfaction. The 12 inch is actually big enough to feed two. But if you are really hungry, this is also a good meal choice for one. It is priced at $16.

Had I wanted to order something else other than pizza, I definitely could have. They have a huge menu with a wide array of starters and entrees to choose from such as pasta and sandwiches. Also, they cater to most diets. Regardless if you are a vegan or a serious meat eating carnivore, you will have an abundant selection of food to choose from. Which is awesome. 

All in all, I really enjoyed my dining experience at the Magic Oven in the Junction. It's a good place to go to for all ages. The prices reflect the high quality of ingredients they use and their commitment to make good food. Highly recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place after looking at their menu online. Maybe I should've paid more attention to all the reviews about how good the pizza is there because maybe I would've ordered pizza. But I ordered pasta instead because they had gorgonzola pasta and that sounded delicious. Until I got my food.

The \"creamy\" sauce was so liquid, it made the dish look like soup with pasta in it. There definitely wasn't enough gorgonzola in the sauce. Based on how they were cut, the chicken and veggies looked like they were the same ones used for the pizza. Overall, overpriced mediocre pasta.

We also had the garlic bread (not worth it) and the soup of the day (the only legitimately good item in our meal). I really wish I had better things to say about the food, but unfortunately, I don't. The service, however, is top notch; very attentive and courteous. I wish I could've given them 2.5 stars just for that.

I may go back for pizza, it seemed like that's what most people came in for (dine in and take out)."}
{"text":"Very friendly and nice service. Ordered chicken trail mix salad and added avocado and it was sooo ýummy, plus, finally someone is generous with chicken!!! Place is decent and quiet. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I think this place appeals mostly to those looking for organic, spelt, gluten free, and lactose free. If you aren't looking for that, you are giving up a lot of flavor. 

I ordered a personal pizza. It was very reminiscent of a homemade pizza made on a flat pita bread. It was surprising that it lacked so much flavor for a premium price.

Otherwise, service was good and drink prices were good. 

I'm told the salads and pastas are good - maybe next time? I'd accompany a friend if they had a craving, but otherwise, there's tonnes of other choices in the area!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great but not worth a mint to eat it.  A family of 4 shouldn't have to pay. $100 for pizza and a little bit of pasta for two children.  Plus one beer."}
{"text":"Happy with the pizza. Reason: 1) Pizza was a fair portion for two people 2) toppings were fairly distributed across the pizza 3) the crust was not too thick and not too thin. it was Goldilocks pizza for me. The only reason why i didn't give it 5/5 is because of one downfall of the pizza: the pizza had a bit too much oil/olive oil."}
{"text":"Found Magic Oven \"by accident\" one night while vacationing nearby. This was the only place we went back to in our week long stay. Fresh great flavors and cozy atmosphere. (Awkward first date inches away from us one night but it was fine). Loved both our meals. We split the Good 'n' Green one night and then the Tandoori Chicken Magic the second. Both were unlike anything we ever tasted! Wish there was one near us at home."}
{"text":"their pizzas are good, but the pastas are absolutely horrible. Just because it's organic it doesn't have to taste like I'm eating sand. 
Their Organic Spelt Rotini with Edamame and Kale sounded great on paper, but was absolutely tasteless. It felt like I was eating boiled greens with boiled flour. 
And it's not cheap either - $15 for a small portion. 
I ordered a Perrier with my dinner, and that was the tastiest part of the meal - go figure."}
{"text":"Often order Magic Oven take-out when I need to work late.  It's a great place to get some gluten free and healthier pizza options.  I often order the Phytonutrient pizza on a gluten free crust.  It's a solid healthy pizza.  The toppings are fresh and generously applied and crust is crispy, but still tastes healthy...I dunno if it's possible, but would love to have a bit more chewiness in the crust (that might require gluten).  I usually pair it with a green salad and it makes for a pretty health take-out meal.  Ironically, they've thrown in free cake once in awhile, which really ruins the health quotient of my meal!  

Delivery generally takes about 30 minutes, so I file it under the reasonably fast, very easy, pretty tasty and mostly healthy category!"}
{"text":"EDIT: 5/2011

I came back here when I was really raring for pizza with arugula (which Martino's doesn't have). In stark contrast to my first pizza experience here, the Harmony Magic pizza is delicious, well-topped, and not dry at all. Maybe it's this particular pizza, who knows. Either way, it was great.  

I don't mind paying $24 for a medium pizza with the meat being organic and the pizza actually having enough toppings. The arugula, prosciutto, onions, gorgonzola, mozzarella, sausage combo was wonderful....

Initial review: 3 stars
This place isn't bad. I've been severely disappointed by their pizzas but somewhat mollified by their pastas. 
The pizzas aren't that great. I got one of the meat ones that had gorgonzola and added pancetta and some other things. The kitchen put so few toppings on my order looked like flatbread and indeed tasted similarly dry/crusty. For the amount that they charge, I expect my pizzas to actually be topped! Mine looked like a chocolate chip cookie with the chips being the lone spots of toppings!

The pastas are a bit better. I usually come for the tandoori chicken pasta  which is essentially fettuccine alfredo with what must be an ample amount of tandoori powder. In fact, it is so spicy that it makes me pant for water while my nose gushes and my ears burn (a net pleasant feeling especially in the winter). I try to justify the $17 price for a small pasta because the chicken is organic and I kind of love that tandoori burn.
The chocolate cake slice was a bit dry but I thoroughly enjoyed the carrot cake especially when I was offered a mango topping option . 

I am still sorely disappointed by my small-size pizza which was so sparsely topped yet cost around $19. 

On the plus side, there is a really cute waiter there who has glasses. God, he's hot."}
{"text":"I've found this location very hit-or-miss in terms of delivery. 

The first time I ordered, I received the most AMAZING vegan pizza with roasted garlic, basil and tomato sauce. But I've only received that one time.

The other two times I have ordered delivery, the pizza has garlic powder and looks completely different from my first experience. I also received the wrong drink order. 

I'm not sure I'll order from here again. 1/3 is not a good enough percentage for me in terms of satisfaction."}
{"text":"possibly the worst pizza place I've ever been to
the vegetables were almost raw - raw zucchini, eek"}
{"text":"I've thrice been disappointed by this oven's purported magic.  

The first was a delivered 16\" pizza that, at nearly $50 (inc. tax, delivery & tip) underwhelmed as but a snack for four and left us all rather hungry.  The pizza itself tasted good, but this was largely due to an unhealthy overcompensation of garlic and olive oil -- it was sparse on the other toppings, and the box was quite literally soaked through with oil.  I swear they used half a bottle.

It was good olive oil, I confess -- I kind of wish I had squeezed the box out and used it to make a vinaigrette.  (Ok, so I don't actually wish that... what I really wish is that they had avoided the excess and used the oil in their own vinaigrette rather than as a moisturizing lotion for our pizza box.)

The second time was at a party, where the pizza was an unappealing sog of white sauce and cheese.  Again, it tasted good, honestly, but the texture was NOT pizza... not sure if it was a specialty crust or something, but it was just wet.  What's with the wet pizza, Magic Oven?  Seriously!  You're not the Magic Crockpot!

Third up was the worst of the bunch, though admittedly not from this location.  I was at Taste of the Danforth and had a slice that was, I surmise, intended to entice me into lifelong patronage...

It was, hands down, the WORST pizza I have ever eaten.  Cardboardish spelt crust (spelt's supposed to be kind of nutty and yummy!), dried up, unsalted/herbless tomato sauce, spinach, and a scatter of feta flakes.  Best way to describe them.  I didn't know feta could be \"dusted\" -- I mean, isn't it supposed to be chunky?  Anyway... it was nasty.  I threw it out.  I'm a sucker for pizza, virtually any pizza, and have never in my life turned down a slice, even a mediocre one.  This one went to the seagulls.   Hyperbole?  Nope.  Just extraordinarily bad. 

Anyway, considering the hefty price tag, I don't think I'll ever again give this company my money.  Y'never know, maybe they'll wow me in the future at some function or another where their food is on offer.  Until then... I'll get my 'za elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great pizza. I'm gluten free and I'm always welcome here. The food is always fresh. I love how they try to be socially responsible with their ingredients. And who doesn't love an apple for the road after your amazing meal. It's a tad on the expensive side. So it's a special occasion place as opposed to a go to spot for a good pizza. But if you haven't tried this place than give it a try."}
{"text":"The prices are pretty high, and the decor at Yonge & Wellesley is definitively tacky. However, they make a mean gluten-free pizza. As for the traditional crust, don't come here if you want a doughy American crust, it's a nice crispy this crust and quite lovely.

The g-free pasta, on the other hand... I've only had it once and it was a soupy, sloppy, mushy mess. A friend of mine had it at another location and said it was really good, so for now I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. 

Without the pasta it would have been 4 stars, now it's 3."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! And also great for people that are gluten intolerant.  It had a very relaxed atmosphere and the staff were super accommodating to large families."}
{"text":"There's a lot of Asian newspaper flying around the Junction, I don't know why.  Also there are tons of cardboard boxes at the curbs of the streets and the garbage cans are overflowing. What does this have to do with the Magic Oven? Nothing.  I'm so confident in the quality of Magic Oven's food, that I can waste your time talking about Asian newspaper.

I'm at Magic Oven most Wednesday nights for the comedy show upstairs. I've tried the Hawaiian pizza, the garlic bread and the beer; all of them were cheesy  (one of the beers were organic/gluten-free/quinoa beer or something hipster-friendly). They've got other beer; like the pumpkin spice beer mmmph! soo good!  Anyway, the pizza was pretty good and came out quickly and the comedy was excellent as always.  There's a $4 beer special on comedy nights and the show is FREE.  I'm gonna go ahead and give Magic Oven 5 stars because I host that comedy show from time to time so FIVE STARS!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars - better than A-OK but I'm not exactly a hardcore fan (the price *broken heart*), ^^; Rounded up because y'all should give it a try if you're good with splurging on good pizza. (Or split with a close friend :) 

Bunch o' friends and I were walking down the Yonge street lookin' for some place to eat because... Guu was not going to be available any time soon (Wait time: 1.5-2hours, MEGASADFAISE) I remember reading good things about Magic Oven so... in we went!

Nice decor. Pretty good service (cutting some slack because it was our server's 2nd day on the job). But slow, slow preparation of food (despite our table being the only one there?!)

Anyway, food-wise: Tandoori Potato Magic, which, according to the menu, iiiis ginger-tomato sauce, green chillies, tandoori sweet potatoes, red onions, light organic mozzerlla and cilantro. SAOO GOOD, savoury, mouthwatering, and jam-packed with flavaaa. Four slices had me just under bloated. 

They gave us candy with our bills. So... yay!"}
{"text":"I ordered 4 family size pizzas - Charcuterie Magic, Pesto Magic, Easy As Pie, and Fresh Market Magic, and an order of chicken wings as well. The honey garlic chicken wings were really good but I didn't think the pizza was anything special. I prefer Pizzaiolo, which is also cheaper. Our order came to over $160.

The service is terrible. I ordered 5 creamy garlic dips (which sounds reasonable since we ordered 4 family sizes) and upon delivery, there was only 1 dipping sauce. I called the store to tell told them there was only 1 dipping sauce. They told me to check the bags again and I told them there was only 1. They seemed like they were certain that the rest of the dipping sauces were in the bag and when I had told them it wasnt in the bag AGAIN, that's when they went to check the order. They advised that I had only ordered 1 dipping sauce. I told them they had made a mistake because I, for sure, ordered 5. They offered to come back to drop it off for us and I asked if we would be charged for it. They said that they won't charge us delivery for it since they screwed up but they will need to charge for the dipping sauces. I'm not sure how that is good customer service? they shouldn't even mention delivery charge for a trip they need to make from their own screw up. I told them not to worry about the dipping sauces and that our office will never order from them again."}
{"text":"Avoid this place, the pizzas were horrible. Oh where do I begin....crust was bland and hard, like cracker.  When cold the crust was so hard you could crack a tooth.  The sauce was also not very memorable and they were skimpy on the toppings.  The pizza was totally out of balance.  Magic Oven was once highly rated by Toronto Life but like most things in Toronto the food was bland and overhyped and overpriced....pies made by pretentious people for pretentious people, not surprising that other locations have closed, Torontonians are wising up to what a good pizza should be.  And It took them over 1 1/2 hrs to deliver the pizza only 2 km away for a place that was not really busy!"}
{"text":"Though Magic Oven is pricey, the quality and freshness is well worth it. And, it's so healthy (it feels like you're doing your body a favour). With so many exotic toppings to choose from I try something new every time I visit. But one menu item that keeps calling me back is the California Gourmet Salad with baby greens, grilled vegetables & soft goat cheese!"}
{"text":"I came here for a paint nite and decided to order food since I did not have the chance to eat.  My group ordered a meat pizza vegan pizza and wings.  I enjoyed the wings most they were saucy and flavourful. The pizza wasn't that got when it was served. The pizza itself was tasty with just the right amount of sauce but would of treated better if it was served a little hotter."}
{"text":"So Magic Oven finally comes to the Junction! Hooray!

I lived in the Annex previously and for a while ordered from the Magic Oven there, as I have dietary needs that only they can meet for ordering in pizza.

Until the quality dipped and it started taking 2 hours+ for pizza to be delivered.

So a new one is opened, and I called them up, ordered 2 small pizzas for delivery.

Well he said it would take 1 hour, which I expected, and that it would cost $42 for two small pizzas, which I also expected.

They showed up almost 2 hours later, even though I live about a 9-10 min drive from the place (it was 9:00 at night too, no traffic), and the pizzas were ice cold.

Yaaaay :/

$40+ for 2 hour delivery for ice cold pizzas? Here we go again.

Its a shame as once we re-heated the pizza the flavors were actually REALLY good, but the crusts had gone a bit hard in the process. I wish I could have tasted this piping hot but apparently that's not something Magic Oven can do these days.

They JUST opened so.. maybe in a few months if I get desperate I'll try again. Maybe."}
{"text":"I'm lowering my score on here because service has gone so downhill.

Delivery orders take up to 2 hours now.


TWO HOURS.

The staff are clueless. The pizzas have gone way downhill. We don't order here anymore unless we get a super craving."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to go out a lot to try new places but now with our 7 month old it's kind of difficult. This was our first time trying Magic Oven so we ordered in. They offer a wide assortment of sandwiches, pasta, and pizza so we went for the pizza. It was delivered right on time and was piping hot.

After looking over the variety of pizzas, we ultimately decided on the charcuterie pizza since my wife and I are both meat lovers. The meat was very tasty and thickly sliced with good portions that covered the entire pizza pretty much to the edge. Depending on how you like your dough, you may or may not like Magic Oven. It's not traditional pizza dough. It's a thin crust that kind of reminds me of naan. Because it's thin it gets nice and crispy on the edges but as I said before, the toppings go to the edge so you don't really have a crust. It's a decent enough pizza with quality toppings but it's not really a traditional pizza and may not be for everyone."}
{"text":"LOVE the pizza; HATE the service.

I always order a veg/vegan pizza on spelt crust and specify extra crispy (otherwise the crust is a bit flimsy). My husband and I have tried a lot of other varieties as well (prociutto, BBQ chicken, etc.). The pizzas are always amazing, but the delivery service usually takes 90 mins (which to me is excessive for PIZZA).  When I call the check on my order the service is less than helpful. 
It's too bad there aren't other innovative, healthy pizza options in the city because if there was I'd forget M.O."}
{"text":"If there was a zero star I would have clicked that...
Soggy Food, Bland Alfredo that tastes like ... Well... Nothing..... there was actually no flavour.

And to top it all off!!! 

A BIG LONG GREASY HAIR BAKED INTO MY CHICKEN WINGS!!! 

Before you order food from here... Dig deep into your wallet, take out whatever cash you would have spent on your meal. Scrunch it up into a tiny ball and enjoy the taste of ink and plastic on your tongue because I guarantee it will taste better than the excuse of a meal the call Fettucini Alfredo and it will probably cost you less!

What a joke..."}
{"text":"This is my second visit. If you looking for organic and healthy food this is the place. Service is a little slow during lunch time. But food is good. Their Pizza and sandwiches are good. Nice ambience. Pricey but then that's the price you pay for organic food."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this place for 3 years , it seems they changed management and the quality has gone completely down.  They have re-sized all their pizza slices to baby size or small size pizzas and changed fries orders to half a small box filled completely cutting corners on \"\"long term customers who pay $50-80 for 1-2 full size pizzas."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner using a Groupon ($10 groupon for $20 worth of food, I think).

We ordered one of their trios of appetizers as a starter - the bean/grain salad, the beets, and the kale hummus. The beets were delicious, perfectly cooked - not too hard or too mushy. The beans / grains dish has a bit of an Indian curry flavour to it, so caution if you don't like that taste. I personally didn't like the kale hummus. I found it to be too bitter tasting, but my dining companion really liked it. I ordered the mixed greens salad and some of the Baby greens were wilty. The pasta was a quite a large serving. More than enough to take home leftovers and have a full meal the next day.

There isn't much ambiance to this place. It kind of looks like an old run down bar that they've converted into a restaurant. On the plus side, they do accept American Express! 

They have lots of options for people with all sorts of tastes and the menu is well labeled with dietary options for any type of diet. Another word of advice - the menu in house is slightly different than the one online. It's not drastically different, but I'm sure if you saw something online that wasn't on the actual menu, then you could probably ask to see if they would make it for you"}
{"text":"Great mix of pub food and vegetarian dishes.  Great experience all 3 times I've been!"}
{"text":"Such a great place and was very proud of the service! Didn't have to wait long for food and the service was just amazing. They have amazing carrot cake as well! Great atmosphere and hoping to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Had delivery from here for a meeting. Lots of different pizza choices, thin crusts, decent amount of toppings. Fav was the pesto chicken, the figs, and the mango walnut salad."}
{"text":"Finally tried the Magic Oven when another restaurant I had planned on going to wasn't open.  I started with the Tofu fingers which were wonderfully spicy. But the pizza arrived too quickly after our appetizers did, so I had to take the rest of the Tofu home with me. The Pizza was tasty- I had the Harmony magic although I found it overpriced. No great selection of beers, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I've only had take-out from here and both times, the food was prepared fresh and quickly (considering I ordered in the restaurant). I tried their vegan hot potato pizza (but they were missing one ingredient, which they allowed me to substitute) and their Tandoori Chicken pasta - which was unique and quite delicious! 
Never felt like eating there though - it's usually empty and doesn't look very inviting."}
{"text":"I didn't pay, or even look at the bill so I can't comment there.

I'm not really into the whole organic thing. We've been altering our food as long as we've had it, genetic modification of food has existed for thousands of years.

my party got the Greek fries (with some funny sauce... tasted good enough), BBQ wings and the uber pepperoni pizza. We also got this funny root beer that was clear.

I was a little underwhelmed by the pizza, it was good but tasted a little bit too homemade (In that I could do it myself with relatively little effort for much cheaper) but it was certainly tasty and not greasy or junky at all.

The Greek fries were nice, but you may as well get them in greektown for half the price and higher quality.

The wings would have to be the highlight of  my dinner, they tasted the most like my moms wings than any I have had in toronto. My mom makes legendary buffalo wings in teh true buffalo style, but the magic oven did make them extremely tasty and with a near perfect texture that combines crispiness as well as juicyness. Unfortunately I like my wings in a more casual bar sort of setting with lots of beer, not a hippie organic restaurant i'm thinking most people agree with me on this point.

I would eat here again, it seemed to have lots of options for good pizza but I'm betting the prices are a little on the unfavorable side.

Did you know you could put lime in root beer? Thats something amazing this place has taught me."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and fast (we were pretty much the only ones in there). Food was mediocre. The prices are average. I still want to try a couple things out on the menu. Seems like the space they have is way too big for the business."}
{"text":"I found the food here a bit disappointing. The vegan power soup is oddly sweet and not very appealing. The pizzas was okay, i ordered the garlic lovers, which was very dry.  Also tried the greek salad, which wasnt bad, but for 7 dollars, a very small portion. Also the dressing was strangely creamy which is a bit weird for greek salad.

I want to like it here because of all of the vegetarian/vegan options, and the idea of it sounds good but it was a bit of a let down. also pretty over priced over all."}
{"text":"I placed an order online. Great set up for ordering. The pizza was good. The gluten free crust was dry, but a welcome delivery system for all the yummy things on top. I also ordered a gluten free carrot cake. It was disappointing from the cake to the icing (icing sugar i think, not cream cheese). I've tasted much better gluten free baked goods. 

I would order the pizza again. Overpriced, but the toppings were generous and super yummy, so worth the price for the occasional treat. The delivery guy was really nice too."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife on a friday night. PWYC comedy with pizza and wings sounded like a great plan. Came in and was offered a seat. I found it odd that they didn't really advertise the comedy. I figure they would want to seat customers where they would enjoy it. We did ask and we were directed upstairs. Ordered the sausage pizza with creamy feta sauce and my wife had the wings with greek fries. The pizza was good. The sauce was meh. I didn't really taste a lot of the feta. The wings was odd. They didn't mix the wings with the sauce rather they give it to you on the side which was a downside. I didn't really want to keep dipping my wings. The greek fries was basically fries with feta on top and a dipping sauce. Again, I think it would have tasted a lot better if it was mixed with the fries. The service was also not great. The place was not that busy and I found the servers didn't come back often. I wanted to order another beer, but my table was just consistently ignored after the food was delivered. The only saving grace about this place was the comedy. The show was surprisingly very entertaining. The headliner was very funny. We stayed for the whole show. Too bad I couldn't enjoy it with a beer. I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"This is my very picky mother's favourite (read: only) dinner spot in the downtown area. She is allergic to gluten and dairy, and they have a lot of gluten and dairy free options, as well as using a separate fryer for gluten and non-gluten, which she appreciates because it means she can have French fries without getting sick after. As for the food...in my mind, it's pretty meh. Their ketchup has an odd aftertaste, although their French fries are cooked well. Their wings are good, their pizza is decent, and their pasta is edible, although their pasta sauces are a bit too watery for my taste - watery sauces are a pet peeve of mine. The restaurant is also pretty small, but there are rarely more than a few tables filled, no matter what time we come. I don't mind getting dinner here when my mom comes down for a visit, but I don't get very excited about it, and I wouldn't make a trip on my own."}
{"text":"They offer great vegan pizza options! With wholegrain extra, its $20 for a medium pizza. Yes pricey,  but delicious."}
{"text":"When visiting Magic Oven on a mid-week afternoon (around 1pm), I was pleasantly greeted by a gentleman by the name of Jordan. It seemed as though the lunch crowd had already fled the restaurant, so greeting guest Jordan doubled as server Jordan. 

Jordan was very informative and attentive, although this may have only been the case as there was only myself and another table in the restaurant at the time. Nonetheless, his knowledge of the menu, personal opinion on dishes and recommendations were spot on.

As I assessed the lunch menu, it was very straightforward and to the point, which is exactly what many customers are looking for during a quick lunch hour. That being said, when asked for the restaurant favourites, many of these items were located on the full dinner menu. In addition, the other table in the restaurant was overheard asking for the dinner menu as well. Having a few staff/guest favourites on the lunch menu could increase foot traffic at this location during lunch.

After ordering my appetizers, the wait was a quick 7-10 minutes. As I slugged back an ice cold Steam Whistle ($3.99 from Monday to Friday, 11am-4pm) from the bar, the Veggie Samosa's (2 pcs - $5) I had ordered arrived, along with the Chicken Vegetable Soup ($5). The Samosa's were light and crunchy, with minimal grease and a terrific kick of spice in the finish. As a lover of spice, I personally would have liked to seen even more spice included in this app, but I understand the standard Canadian stomach may not be able to handle the heat. These were very tasty with the potato and curry flavours rising to the occasion. 

The Chicken Vegetable Soup was also a pleasant surprise. With a hint of pessimism on my part at the time of ordering, Jordan assured me that it would be a good decision to try. The soup arrived and the visual was a gorgeous blend of colours. It's visual appeal was followed by a fresh, hearty and delicious soup. The combination of numerous fresh vegetables, as well as spices and large pieces of seasoned chicken, quickly tempered the pessimism felt earlier on. Although the broth seemed slightly watered down or a key spice absent from the dish, the amount of chicken and vegetables more than made up for this slight hiccup.

Again, at the suggestion of Jordan, I ordered the Balance Spelt Rotini ($18) from the dinner menu. As the dish arrived, the aromas took hold and was quite enjoyable. Although no pepper or parmesan was offered, the spinach, sun dried tomato, roasted flaxseeds, figs and chicken in a beautiful rose sauce took hold of my taste buds and didn't hold back. The balance of sweet and savoury ingredients was just right. Jordan hit a home run with this recommendation and I would highly recommend this dish for the permanent lunch menu. 

To top off this lunch experience, I decided to try the Mango Sorbet ($3). It was so frozen, a knife was used to slice the piece of sorbet. This was less than ideal. Since it was topped with fresh mango's, my time was spent devouring those while the sorbet melted enough to consume. Once I was able to try the sorbet, it was quite good but resembled a McCain's frozen juice from concentrate. It was very sweet and since I had already wolfed down the fresh mango slices, there was nothing to cut the sweetness of the actual sorbet. 

Overall, my experience at the Magic Oven was very positive. The service was terrific and the recommendations made by our boy Jordan were solid. I'd recommend anyone in the area to stop in for lunch, dinner or even an open mic/comedy night that they hold weekly. 

Stars - 3.5/5

{"text":"Well I used to order from here all the time when I didn't have time to make dinner.  I used to get a vegan slice which was regular \"slice\" size like you would get from any other pizza place.  A slice is supposed to be a meal for one person for the most part and it used to do very well.  For the last few times the slices have shrank in size yet prices have remained the same.  I'm not sure how one could charge for something like this and call it a full slice of pizza.  It looks like two small pieces of a pizza if you were to order a whole pizza.  Defeats the whole purpose.  I called them and they confirmed that they have reduced their sizes! Such rip offs ...."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza on a coworker's recommendation. Sadly I think he must have been sold on the much-touted organic ingredients rather than the quality because it was not particularly great. The pizza was a typical example of how my girlfriend disparagingly refers to North American pizza: \"bread with toppings.\" The crust was a bit too thick, soggy, and bread-like, while the edges were overdone, almost like toast. The toppings didn't strike me as anything out of the ordinary, and some of the meat toppings were nearly burnt to a crisp.

It's also pricey for pizza, which I'd be fine with if it was actually good."}
{"text":"While not magical, it is something nice that comes out of the ovens at Magic Oven. Having ordered for delivery for clients a couple times, I thought it a good idea to see what the in person atmosphere is like. Upon entering, the lights are dim and the tables look like they have been well used. Not to say the place was not clean, because the tables and floors were quite clean for a place that looks like it is more run-down than it is. Although from what surrounds the restaurant it looks like it will be a sketchy place, all that sketchiness seems to remain outside the doors.

It took a while for the waitress to come over to bring the menus over and to take our drink orders. The reason for this was she was also the bartender and seemed the be the only person on the floor at 7:00pm on a Tuesday evening. Their selection was really slim on beers, so I decided to go with an organic root beer...at least beer was in the name! When the drinks eventually came and she was ready to take our order I was very pleasantly surprised with the organic root beer which was clear and tasted amazing. (If anyone knows where I can buy organic root beer I would be very interested!) I ordered the Meaty Magic pizza and the vegetarian I was with ordered the Gourmet Veggie Magic pizza. Just a fore-warning to everyone, the prices are not exactly cheap with the meat option being $18 for a 10\" and $28 for a 16\"; with this in mind I recommend going on Wednesday nights from 5-9 when they have all you can eat pizza for I believe $15.

The food came out quicker than the time it took for get to the point that we ordered, which was both nice and a little weary at the same time. The pizzas looked and smelled good, but less than 15 minutes for pizza when it takes forever to get a refill is a little bit of a red flag. After the first bite we realized that it was an unjustified red flag as the pizza was in fact and very tasty pizza. The crust was crispy the way I like and the organic toppings did taste better than their non-organic counterparts. The sauce was a little high in salt, but overall the pizza was really tasty. My companion said the grilled eggplant and garlic zucchini were really fresh, but the roasted peppers were too over-cooked. Getting our plates cleared so we could order dessert was as much of a chore as getting service in the first place, but I still ordered the Organic Blackout Chocolate Cake with Spiced Molten Chocolate Sauce because I can't pass up on chocolate.

With everything being organic so far I thought I was safe, but chocolate let me down for the first time in a very long time. The cake itself was dry and way too much cocoa was used in the mix. A dry cocoa taste was left in my mouth with each bite, and it was not very pleasant. I don't remember the last time I didn't finish a piece of chocolate cake, but I did not finish that slice. It wasn't too big and I wasn't too full, it just tasted off and that is obviously not good. The meal itself was really good and I will definitely keep ordering from them, but the service and the dessert also stick in my mind quite a bit and that will make me think twice about a recommendation..."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes for mediocre food. I watched the kitchen staff smell an avocado to determine if it was still \"good\". The staff were inattentive and poor communicators. This could be a great neighborhood hang. I'm not coming back to find out if they have figured it out."}
{"text":"Way over-priced! It's not worth your money, and I would never go back. The bartender was nice, and they have good local beer on tap - but so do, like, bars right? Yeah. We went for the cache of eating trendy, organic, hipster-with-a-credit-card food. Oops. Skip it."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the magic oven & I like this little location. It's right at Eglinton & Avenue. It's a small take out place but has the full menus. There are a couple stools to eat that face outwards towards the street. The staff is friendly and the service is fast. The food can be hit or miss to be honest. The fries are always amazing. Definitely a safe order. The pizza is hit or miss, the wraps are the same."}
{"text":"Food pretty darn good. Staff is friendly, prices are good. The Danforth location is my favourite but when I'm downtown I like to stop in here & get my Magic Oven fix. The menu is great, they have EVERYTHING. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a tough review to wright purely based on the fact that I LOVED magic oven! The food was amazing, service was on point, prices where great. There was nothing not to love. The owner has decide to make some changes & unfortunaily they're not the best ones. To make it simple the prices have good up by a pretty penny & the food has gotten gross. Not everything has gotten bad but I dislike more items on the menu then I enjoy. Undercooked food, hair in the food or ordering a special way (ie. over cooked, light on the peppers) & it not coming the way you order it. Some other the servers are amazing & frankly were the only reason I gave the new magic oven so many chances. I wish I could say the new magic oven is the bee's knees but it's not very good. I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"The pizzas are made with fresh ingredients you can taste the difference, generous toppings but I find the pricing too high"}
{"text":"Ick.

My SO and I ordered take-out from here for our anniversary (we're high rollers after all).  We ordered the tofu appetizer and a pizza.

Well, the tofu was stank nasty.  Yes - you read correctly.  Stank. Nast. Tee.  It reaked up the entire room and we could barely force ourselves to choke it down (we tossed it after we had sampled it).  It tasted like tofu with almost no flavouring - the dipping sauce was also nothing to write home about.  Where - oh where - did the horrifying scent of dirty, sweaty feet come from?  Ain't no tofu gotta smell like that.


The pizza was fine altho somewhat soggy.  I was hoping for something a little more high-end and tasty for the price point.  Honestly, we'll stick to Pizzaolio if we want \"gourmet\" pizza.  Highly disappointing - especially because we were psyched for all their high-end ingredients."}
{"text":"....maybe 3.5

So I am traveling in Toronto for a conference and OF COURSE yelped for some good gluten free eats. Found Magic Oven, and yeah their prices are a bit high....

So the up side - the pizza really tastes great! The dough is nice and crispy and has a great flavor, and they offer soy cheese. 

The down side - the price, and I got a medium pizza...and it's small. I don't think that for the size, $20 was really appropriate...gluten free or not. 

The situation - I used Grub Hub up here to order and get delivery, and they messed up my order. They were awesom and had a new (correct) pizza to me in about 30 minutes. I was really impressed by that.

The summary - if you are gluten free and don't mind paying for a tasty pizza, DO IT!"}
{"text":"Awesome vegan options, my kids devoured a whole pizza in min, service was very friendly and accommodating. Looking forward to coming back in the spring to try  out their patio, alcoholic drinks and more vegan menu options, will report back in a couple months. This is a beautiful space with lots of potential, so far so good."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and clean environment, the veggie sandwich was delicious and the salad was standard. Pizza crust was not greasy but samosas were dry.

Have to pay for green P parking at the back and food took awhile to make although we were the only customers at the time.

Would come back if we're in the area"}
{"text":"Epic  flavors are the standard faire at the Magic Oven. I'm becoming quite the fan! Note that wait times are longer than your average pizza joint, as they make the pizza fresh while you wait."}
{"text":"Was expensive food, but now even more expensive that they've shrunk the large pizza's to 14\" from 16\" unannounced last week. 
I would normally have left over food, but tonight I did not have enough to feed my family as I was unaware of the size changes even as a long time customer of many years. 
Very good food... When it's made right.. Which 60% of the time.
Sad to say magic oven has lost a long time customer who's struggled with the trying times of this restaurant. We will miss you're good food, but not your overpriced incorrect orders.
There many more restaurants to get the correct quality food for the money you pay."}
{"text":"We're in love with the new Magic Oven that opened recently in our neighborhood near Coxwell and Danforth.  We're there for lunch often - for $10.00 you can get an incredibly delicious sandwich (we usually go for the pulled Tandoori chicken and the chicken with avocado).  For that price you get your choice of salad soup or fries.  And btw, these are no ordinary sides - the fries are amazing and the salad is filled with unusual greens and not your average veggies (yummy house balsamic based dressing too).  If I have one quibble it's that the back half of the restaurant is a little dark - it would be nice if either the blinds at the front were opened a little more or they change their lighting (brighter bulbs would do the trick). Otherwise a perfect experience!"}
{"text":"Had a Salmon + Spinach regular sized pizza + a fettucine w/ pesto + walnuts. Both delicious meals. I love the thin crust on their pizzas, probably the best pizza I've had in many years. 

The pasta was a little too oily, but delicious. Came with garlic bread, too. Kinda wish they put in some more veggies with this, but oh well.

Prices are great for the quality that they put in. The service was pretty good, a little on the slow side though.

Overall, I highly recommend this place if you are looking to have some genuine quality pizza or pasta. Definitely coming back : )"}
{"text":"I keep forgetting about this place. There are so many fancy new vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Toronto that Magic Pizza has fallen off the radar. I hadn't visited in more than 3 years, but a friend invited me out to the Queen East location. 

It was a Monday, so other than two tables, it was pretty dead here. The building itself isn't fancy, there haven't been any renos since my last visit, but the open patio in the back is a great way to get away from the noise of the city. 

Generally, I have low standards with vegan pizza. We ordered the (vegetarian) Phyto-Nutrient pizza ($15) and the Vegan Magic pizza ($14) and both were surprisingly awesome! Got the Creamy Feta Dip as well, which was finger-licking good! I was happy to take home the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Lots of options for both the vegan and vegetarian."}
{"text":"Egads, this is considered good pizza?  The crust was the quality of frozen pizza crust (hard/boring), and the cheese was tasteless and the texture of rubber.  It had plenty of sauce which had some taste, but when you have to drown a pizza in sauce to give it taste, it's just sad.  The toppings (tomato/onion/mushroom) were pretty much irrelevant with all the bad stuff going on, but they were technically ok.  Save yourself some money and grab a frozen pizza if you are ever tempted to try this pizza.  My Magic Oven pizza experience was with the Broadview location for reference.

I'm not a fancy pizza girl looking for unique pizza toppings, just want to be able to enjoy the simple elements of a pizza and be able to taste all of them; thin crispy pizza crust that is tasty all on its own for dipping, flavorful sauce and quality toppings and cheese.

My quest to find a pizza offering with fresh crust, flavor from spices and quality toppings continues, and I welcome suggestions from fellow yelpers on my journey.

xo"}
{"text":"The pizza and the pasta are both pretty good, I order them online and walk over there to pick them up during lunch they're always hot and ready. It is a little over priced but the pizza portion is great but the pasta not so much, the atmosphere is awesome and the only downside would have to be the price other then that this place is great for lunch or early diner."}
{"text":"To be honest, I always forget that this place exists until I walk by it. I really like the food here, they offer some different choices for pizza which is nice. If I lived closer, I would probably get take out from here quite often. 

Good food, the people working there are always friendly. Kind of pricey for pizza, though."}
{"text":"This is not only the most expensive pizza place I've ever been to, it is also by far the worst tasting.  They seem to be popular for their vegetarian and gluten-free options, however for me there is no appeal.  Normal pizza has a fluffy bready crust, but Magic Oven has a flat, hard, cardboard-like crust.  Even a coworker who is not at all picky took one bite of my leftover slices and refused to eat any more. Not only did it taste terrible, it cost me about $18 to get a personal pizza and drink.  You are better to take that money and get a full-sized, normal tasting pizza somewhere else and share it with your friends.  I have never been back to Magic Oven and never will be."}
{"text":"Cozy little restaurant that serves organic food. I was pretty full so I just got a sweet summer salad which had spring mix, baby spinach, mangoes, avocado with grapefruit vinaigrette. Salad is pretty typical but I guess the vinaigrette was kinda special. Not worth $11 (including tax & tips) if you ask me (I'm cheap tho since salads you can kinda buy at sobeys for $5 that I can eat for at least 2 meals) 

My friends ordered pasta. Spaghetti with meat sauce and balanced pasta. They said it tasted pretty good. The pasta came with bread (my friends were dudes so I couldn't take a pic for you guys and they had no idea if the bread was garlic bread or just buttered). Pasta orders are around $15-$20 (tax and tips included) 

Service was decent. I think would come back to try their pizza!"}
{"text":"Terrible overpriced fucking pizza. Took an hour to get here. Delivery guy went to the wrong door and could barely speak English.

The pizza was really cold,the crust was paper thin and hard. The pizza was bland and flavourless. 

Never ordering this place again"}
{"text":"This place is kind of cozy and if you're vegan, its probably a decent choice but if you're suffering from a major pizza craving and you have no dietary restrictions then stay away. 
They have plenty of options for toppings here but I found it wasn't worth it at all. They're going for the organic/gourmet angle here but I don't care if the tomato sauce is lovingly made with organic vegetables plucked with the utmost care of a thousand vegan fairies, if you're charging $20 for an individual pizza, it better taste good. 
The crust was overcooked and it hurt my mouth to chew it. The sauce was pretty bad and overly sour like they just threw tomato sauce on the dough. I asked for additional chicken and there was barely any so that was a disappointment. 
The restaurant was at 10% capacity the last time I was here and every time I walk past it, there never seems to be a lot of diners. Service was good but that's expected given it was practically empty. 
They have a good concept but now they just need a better recipe."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here Saturday night. 

Beets in Lemon @ $6.00
They were definitely beets. Not sure if they were in Lemon.

1 x Spicy Sausage Magic Pizza @ $17.00
1 x Double Hawaiian Magic Pizza @ $19.00
Spicy Sausage was incredible greasy (I'm surprised the box stayed together).
Both were questionably cooked. Not sure they were finished. 

1 x Creamy Carrot Cake @ $6.09 
Weird price. Felt very much store-bought, but tasted fine. 
Small piece for $6.

I will never eat here again. So expensive for food I didn't enjoy at all.
Dominos, Pizza Pizza... any of the chains would have been preferred over this. 

(I hate leaving negative reviews, but I was quite disappointed)"}
{"text":"I give Magic Oven a 5/5 rating for the type and style of restaurant they are. I feel like they pulled it off successfully on decor, food, service, and price point making the dinner experience in a pizza joint enjoyable. My wife was at the salon in the area and when she was finished we decided to check these folks out. When we saw them last they were in the Pape and Danforth area. The decor is simple, clean and well layed out. Although it was just the two of us for dinner, you could dine here by your lonesome, sit at the bar (which looked drink-worthy) and pour a couple back while eating some good grub (they have an eclectic menu of Italian dishes - organic, meat, vegan, pizzas and wraps). So if you're by yourself you can chill at the bar, or a single table, or you can pull all those tables together and have a pizza partay! There seemed to be non-stop action too while we were there. People were coming and going, sitting or taking out. There is a theatre next door (Cole Mine Theatre) and the staff tell us that Magic Oven cohorts with them to do a dinner and theatre package. Sounds cool...I'll have to check that out sometime soon. Anyhow, the food (my pizza and my wife's wrap) was really really good. Some of the best pizza I've had. I'd suggest checking them out and don't think you'll be disappointed. No patio though. Nice and friendly staff to boot."}
{"text":"Lamb wrap and goat cheese bliss y'all. That's what I'm eating right now. Ordered Magic Oven via Just Eat for the 3rd time and THIRD TIME IS A CHARM Y'ALLL! The first time I ordered Magic Oven they where 2 hours late but they gave me free cake and a voucher for another meal. I was pissed but I was also like \"I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE FINE\" and it was okay. This lamb wrap and this goat cheese dip though? They are making my life now. It also only took 30 min instead of an hour so BONUS!

Is the food to expensive? HECK YES but it's healthy or something? I dunno. 

Really this is just the dip talking. God damn. This goat cheese dip is too good."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad.

They don't skimp on the pricier toppings, which is really nice. I added avocado to my  pizza and they put a lot on, not just a few pieces. And they have vegan options, a big plus.

This place will make meat eaters and vegans happy!

Awesome toppings that you can add to your pizza: kale, avocado, sweet potato, tofu...the list goes on...endless possibilities!!!"}
{"text":"Went in to pick up pizza, it wasn't quite ready, and they had me take a seat, they brought me a glass of water, and even offered to refill it.

The pizza was very big for a large, very tasty and the organic crust and fresh toppings were great.

Will be back again.

Prices are a bit high compared to mainstream, but organic and high quality toppings like fresh pineapple are worth the extra cost."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken avocado wrap and side greens to go ($14). 

The greens inside the wrap were wilted, soggy and brown. The wrap itself was grilled, which gave the unripe, hard, avocado a very strange flavor (who heats avocado?). The chicken in the wrap was way too spiced and there was a sweet sauce that I could not identify.

The entire wrap fell apart after one bite; it was truly inedible!

The greens on the side were just that - greens, with two small cucumber slices. The balsamic dressing did not even partly mask the intense bitter flavor of the greens.

Friendly service, but unfortunately the food was inedible."}
{"text":"Service was great. The Santorini salad and fries were awesome! Great neighborhood lunch spot"}
{"text":"I tried Magic Oven for the first time tonight with a friend. 

It was a little odd to me that we were the only ones in the entire place considering it was around 5 30pm on a Sunday, but inside had a nice ambience. 

Our server was extremely friendly and greeted us as soon as we entered the restaurant. 

 I definitely suggest splitting food with a friend because the portions are huge! We ordered the garlic bread with cheese to start, split a 12' pizza with pineapple and grilled eggplant and for dessert, carrot cake! 

The service was super fast, and everything was really good! The only thing I found was the pizza could have been a little more flavourful - the base was a little bland. Being someone with a huge sweet tooth, my favourite part was the carrot cake! I absolutely love cream cheese icing! (And you can get the dessert for free with purchase of a main by checking into Yelp). 

Overall, a really good meal! I even had some pizza left over (that's how big the portions are). I also love how there are so many vegetarian and vegan options, as well as non GMO tomato sauce :) I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Magic Oven is one of the few health conscious places I can depend on for decent delivered food.

 I usually order two salads the Mediterranean Arugula Chicken and I especially like the Summer Sweet salad for it's tangy grapefruit viniagrette dressing.  Don't be fooled by the size of the small salads, that sucker, especially the Summer Sweet salad with its generous helping of walnuts keeps me full for a whole afternoon!

Ordering delivery online is a snap and because I ordered after the lunch rush, about 1:30pm, my order came within MINUTES!  Very impressive indeed Magic Oven :)"}
{"text":"Hubby was feeling like staying-in to eat tonite as Taste of the Danforth had taken over our neighbourhood eateries and rendered them null & void in terms of competent service ability.  Not so at Magic Oven though!  We ordered delivery from their bountiful online menu which offers fantastic and healthy renderings of pizza and other deliciousness.

Hubby ordered the Summer sweet salad with baby greens and grapefruit viniagrette, avocados and mango and Tandoori chicken magic pizza, while I got the Avocado chicken ciabatta sandwich with lime cumin.

We were hesitant at first to order as the phone rang, and rang and when the friendly order taker had our order she advised that delivery would be about an hour wait due to the Taste of the Danforth, but we didn't mind, especially since hubby had a serious chubby for exotic/organic pizza tonite! Well we were in for a surprise as the order came to our door in like 20 minutes! Talk about FAST! Wait was that a broomstick the delivery guy/warlock rode away on???

My Avocado chicken ciabatta was real good and I loved the sweetness of the cumin lime marinated avocados.  Hubby as always wolfs his food down like a castaway who was just re-introduced into civilization and  decent food, but his repeated nodding and chewing tells me his Tandoori pizza and summer sweet salad are tastefully worthy, well they smelled and looked great anyway.

I know people gripe about Magic Oven's $$$ but really, I'd rather spend $36 on the meal we had and be healthfully satisfied then spend the same amount on \"joe blow's pizza\" and risk either food poisoning or heartburn so I'd say we got our money's worth.

So if your craving a change from the usual run of the mill delivery joints, let Magic Oven conjure up some deliciously spellbinding yet enchantingly healthy meals fit to nourish your inner dragonslayer."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza for sit in lunch or on the go! Tried the veggie, bbq chicken and pepperoni. They're always flavourful, not greasy and the thin crust is always crispy (not dried out or burned).  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Impressive pizza. Way better than I had expected! And arrived to the door hot. The sauce was perfect on thin crust- with evenly, and generously distributed toppings. I will be ordering again! Great price too."}
{"text":"Came here last night with family (big group about 20 of us) b/c of the organic pizza. I ordered the Edamame $5, big portion for five dollars. The salads here are huge, which is great! I had the Summer Sweet Salad (Baby greens in grapefruit vinaigrette with avocado, mango and walnuts $13) I asked to add on goat cheese which they did. There was prob 2 pieces of avocado on it when I got it and I asked for some more, the waitress was like \"they're probably on the bottom\" but I mixed it and there was nothing. She did bring out some more though. A number of people in the group ordered the Grilled chicken & portobello mushroom penne in asiago cream sauce $16 and said it was really good. The pasta and salad options are large portions, the pizza looked normal sized for single servings. The restaurant was casual, and only 2 other tables seated while we were there, however it was Dec 23rd. 
Overall, it was okay, probably wouldn't go back with all the options in Toronto."}
{"text":"Location closed.
I ordered via Maegan app, they took my money and the delivery never came. Waited for 90 mins. Contacted Maegan, they said the restaurant should refund my visa. 

I'd avoid Maegan app as they have not been helpful and don't have a strategy when a restaurant closed without them knowing."}
{"text":"I am an extremely picky and critical eater and this is one of my fave places to eat.  I am not a fan of the pizza's but the pasta's and sandwiches are to die for. The staff and atmosphere is always welcoming friendly and down to earth type of feel."}
{"text":"Nothing magic about this pizza. Quite the opposite of magic. Save your money and eat a five star dinner somewhere else for same price as their nasty pizza, which has basically no sauce and a paper thin crust that is so tough and chewy, I'm pretty sure they made it in the microwave. This place used to be so good, but they changed their recipe or something and now its so gross. Salad and fries are yummy though- basically every other thing but the pizza. Patio is nice as well, but for delivery- just so overpriced and not good."}
{"text":"Healthy pizza and had this chicken pesto with spelt crust. They had a yummy chicken pasta and panini too! It's a little pricey but it's definitely a healthier pizza place. And the deliver :)"}
{"text":"Surely, the word \"magic\" sparks the imagination. As does \"oven\" on a day as cold as today's. After wondering about it from afar for so very long, I finally went in to see what all the fuss was about.

It may seem ridiculous to write about this place when I have yet to try their pizza, but I saw another reviewer only mention it in passing, while moving onto a different favourite dish. Thus, I am justified. I had a goat cheese and veggie sandwich, which is one of the most familiar combinations in my palate's life. Still, I very much dug it. 

The bread was supersoft and flavourful, though the filling, at times, felt mildly bland- usually only when there was maybe not enough goat cheese to go around. It was a great size, and freshly made, but truthfully a bit expensive for just a sandwich with no side to speak of- which (from reading their menu) I'm inclined to believe is due to some high quality, organic ingredients. Still though...I'll reserve a final decision until I have my first pizza."}
{"text":"The prices on the Magic Oven's menu we're reasonable (both food and drink) and the descriptions sounded great! The appetizer portions were quite small, but we had enough pizza to bring home for lunch the next day. The staff were attentive, friendly and accommodating.

The pizza was served on a cracker-like crust. When we asked why the crust was so flat and hard the staff member told us it was because it was 'organic flour'. There was a further disconnect when a dipping sauce was described as having a real 'kick to it' when we could isolate no spice whatsoever; and a sweet beer as being 'very bitter'.

Overall, we found the food extremely bland and the ambience lacking. If we go back, it would be for drinks. They had some very interesting beers on the menu, both on tap and in bottles."}
{"text":"There was nothing magical about the pizza I got from Magic Oven!
It tasted ok, but two \"Uber Pepperoni\" slices and a drink set me back $13.

Granted my slice was large, it was also dripping with grease. I am not usually a pizza dabber, but this was so bad I had to eat it with a knife and fork just to ensure my dress wouldn't get dirty! I am used to ordering double extra cheese pizzas at 241 and they are still never this greasy!

The Mango Tangerine drink I got was nothing special. 
All in all I will pass on this place next time."}
{"text":"There was a dead cockroach nestled in our kale caesar salad. Do not order from here. We don't know if there were more as the cockroach was smothered in dressing at the bottom of the dish. Took 1.5 hours to have this and our cold pizza delivered to us. We complained and were told by the manager (Tony) that we would get a $50 gift card for this incident. We received a $25 card in the mail 3 weeks later- not that we'd ever go back or use it. Health Canada needs to pay this place a visit."}
{"text":"Frequented by locals, pizza lovers and health nuts, this place has the best service and healthiest pizza/pasta in the Junction. I had a hard time choosing what to get because I'm indecisive, and I want everything on the menu. I ended up getting the Balance Spelt Rotini because it had flax seeds and figs in it -- never tried anything like it before. It was SO DAMN GOOD. The portion was big, and it came with roasted pita (or something similar). Since it's \"spelt pasta\" it's super healthy so you don't feel guilty after eating a big bowl. 

If I could give this place 4.5 stars instead of 5, I would. I wasn't super excited about my drink. I ordered a sangria. I know it's not sangria season, and I know I should've gone for a craft beer instead, but I was tempted by the large SANGRIA sign on the drink menu. It only had pineapples in it and for $10, I expected more wine. Note to self: Do not order sangria in winter. 

The service was perfect. I was greeted by an adorable server who seemed really happy to be at work. She was really enthusiastic about the menu and helped me choose the pasta. It's nice to meet \"real\" servers who genuinely like the food they sell to customers! 

The place itself has a cute, laid back ambience. It's perfect for big parties and solo diners. Try their vegan cookies. \"Vegan\" cookies may not sound like they could be delicious, but these are so so good, and they only cost 3 bucks!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from Magic Oven for a family dinner and it went over well with everyone. The chicken wings were a big hit, as were the Kale Caesar and Beans, Lentils & Greens salads. The only negative was the Prana Magic pizza. The flavours were wonderful, but I was left wanting... more. The toppings were way too sparse. The pizza was essentially naked crust. It looked and tasted sad. My suggestion to the restaurant would be to use thinly sliced sweet potatoes to cover the whole pizza and more figs and cheese (the gorgonzola gave it a nice zip but that was like 0.5-1 bite per slice). This definitely didn't cut it as a hearty vegetarian entree. Would be fine as a starter or side. No complaints from the meat eaters about the Charcuterie Magic pizza - it was loaded."}
{"text":"Well to be honest I ordered my Pizza with figs and spinach and the Hearty spaghetti  to be delivered.  Don't know if this was part of the reason the food was so crappy.

First the pizza.  Where was the cheese.  I had a dolop on top of the ingredients but all I could taste was the very acidy tomato sauce that tasted as if it was spooned right out of a tomato paste can.  The crust was not crispy and crunchy but more soggy and smelled from the cardboard box.  Frankly one of the crappiest pizzas I've ever tasted.

And cost, holy it's twice as expensive as the average pizza (got 30% off at Tasteaway)

On to the Hearty spaghetti, which is supposed to be spaghetti with rich meat sauce. Well the restaurant doesn't even know what meat sauce is.

The 'meat sauce' was the same crappy tomato paste that was on the pizza with some pan fried chopped meat crumbled in.  Not sauce at all.

Needless to say I would not recommend the food from this place it was god awful."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my friend and absolutely enjoyed the food and service here.  I got the Garlic Tomato Magic pizza and vegetarian samosa lunch combo which was well worth the price. The pizza tasted very fresh and flavorful with just the right amount of spices that really enhanced the individual ingredients' flavors. It's a thin pizza with a good crunch. The samosas were so crispy and filled up and savory. The waiter in particular was really nice and helped us pick out food from the menu and was really patient with our indecisiveness. He always came by to see if we needed anything and constantly refilled our drinks without asking. I would love to come back here."}
{"text":"Out on a walk on a cold day we spotted the Magic Oven located just west of Yonge Street. The place is located in an restaurant that used to be an Italian restaurant that went out of business a few years ago. The menu was intriguing with lots of vegan options. Everything sounded really good with unique pairings. 

The place is long and narrow with a window looking south onto Wellesley Street. Entering the place was empty and really quiet, no background music. The atmosphere was sterile and less than welcoming but we sat down anyways, curious about the menu options. While everything was pricey we assumed this was because of the diverse options. 

The food arrived quickly, too quickly to have been prepared properly and was immediately disappointing. I ordered the BBQ tofu sandwich and my friend the lamb penne. While the menu reads like a specialized restaurant the servings and quality of the food was more like one would expect from a kiosk in a food court. The BBQ tofu sandwich was simply thinly sliced tofu slathered in a store bought BBQ sauce dressed with spinach and gooey onions under a pita. I was hoping for some cubed tofu and a dry BBQ rub that was then grilled for texture and taste. My friend's pasta was just as disappointing. I guess we expected too much, but will not be returning to try the overpriced options. It really is just a fast food place pretending to be something more than it is."}
{"text":"Yes, the pizza tastes incredible.

But the price-per-slice is so absurd you'd be better off making your own pizza at home or slumming it at a cheaper pizza place. There's no reason to pick Magic Oven over another pizza place unless you have gluten/wheat intolerance or extreme dietary requirements (which is what they specialize in).

I'm not exaggerating when I say a standard goat cheese, mushroom and tomato pizza big enough for three people was $45 (oh, we got delivery, which I believe we were charged $10 for). There were six slices in the pizza, making the per slice cost almost $8. Obscene!"}
{"text":"It's been a minute since we were in Toronto, but Magic Oven just got brought up at work and I HAD to write them a quick note!

To me, a restaurant is more than just the food. Everything from the atmosphere to the pleasantness of the staff, etc. all play a part in creating the overall experience. 

My family and I took a short trip to New York and then up to Toronto after a couple months of nothing but solid work and school. We were pretty tired from all of the traveling from the preceding days and decided to order in. We got a Tandoori Chicken Magic Pizza, a pound of wings and Greek Fries. I'd mention the hotel, but we liked it so much, we'd like to visit again. (#nocreepers :P)

Now, normally, I'm not big on Indian spices, but they talked me into it. The pizza was amazing. The sauce had a nice amount of heat and a refreshing kick of ginger. I can honestly say, I have NEVER had a pizza like this before. SUPER creative! Cilantro and tandoori chicken on a pizza? I would have never thought to have tried it.
 
I didn't realize it until later that the wings (which were decently sized) were gluten free. Again, usually \"gluten-free\" isn't my thing, but I loved it. Greek food will always steal my heart, so it's no wonder that I fell in love with their Greek Fries. I still dream about the feta dip that came with them.

The delivery was super quick and the food was burn-your-mouth-off hot on arrival.

I definitely want to stop into the restaurant the next time we make it up this way!"}
{"text":"My vegan sister raved about how awesome this place WAS 6YEARS AGO!! I knew that it wasn't the same but they take it to a whole new level. As soon as we got in a guy sitting down on his phone and asked \"table for two\"... ON THE PHONE!! Later we saw the Waitress who was nice and I don't blame her for the horrible food. Later I realized that the guy on the phone was the manager, ha! Bad start but we had some hope for the food, boy were we disappointed

Best salad: beets were overcooked. Ordered a bunch of appetizers and the geniuses put them all in one plate and the water from the beets went everywhere. Great!!
Samosa was decent, probably frozen
Tofu: no flavour, not seasoned at all
Tofu bbq: same story, but with bbq sauce which wasn't bad but they barely put any so it was 
dry as $$@2!!
Lasanna: mixed bowl of shit with some cheese on top for $18!! 

Sad place, I feel bad for the company because these guys did wonders for the vegetarian/vegan movement but sad to say but I would never go back"}
{"text":"This place is cute. I've been a fan of the food for a while, as I've had it delivered on several occasions. It wasn't until I started to get more familiar with the Junction that I'd finally check this place out. Beer and drink selection is decent. The menu is vast thus making a choice very difficult. This place is especially great if you are vegan or gluten-intolerant. Plenty of choice for people who are usually restricted. I'm a fan of their wings, pasta, pizza and greek fries. So, essentially, all the food here. 

I can't wait to come and bask in their rooftop patio with a pint and some grub."}
{"text":"Okay so, let me just say that I like Magic Oven.  I think they have a great product and concept.  I'm all about healthy options, fresh ingredients, gluten free options, veg options, good meats, local, yada yada yada.  I've done walk in a number of times at Magic and I've always enjoyed my experience.  I never mind paying top dollar for quality food.  On my last trip to the Jefferson location, the pizza was good and the staff were nice.  Other than some clown's dog barking out the window from the apartment above, the experience was good.  

The problems only arise upon delivery.  Sunday night was the 3rd time I've ordered delivery from Magic Oven (Jefferson).  I feel like every time we do delivery, my girl and I look at each other a few bites in and say, \"This is kinda shitty.  I don't think we're gonna order from them again...\"  
Sunday night:
Order called in at 8:02pm
Oder arrived at 9:24pm.  Really?  90 minutes later?  I called about 70 minutes in to find out where my pizza pies were...  the guy said \"yeah, we're just really busy\".  Shiiiiit, son, handle your biz.  It's Sunday night, it's cold and raining in Toronto... Sounds like Pizza night to me, bro.  
Delivery guy arrives, and he's super nice and all smiling and shit...  I think, okay, cool, whatever.  Hopefully the food is worth the wait.  
The order:

The wings were pretty bland and not actually that warm any more.  They actually might have been the worst wings I've ever had.  
The fries were soggy and warm.  
(Yeah, I know...  Don't order fries or wings from a pizza joint).  

The pizzas were both not hot anymore, a little dry, pretty bland and kinda cardboardy (I don't recommend the $2 brown rice crust upgrade).  
One of the pizzas was pretty spicy too, although there was no mention of spice.  

The damage, w tax - $51 and then I tipped the driver $7. 
All in all, a wildly disappointing pizza experience.  

Dear Magic Jefferson, hire more staff, put more sauce on your pizza, invest in some hot pizza insulation bags that work.  Oh, and stop making wings.  
Also, if you're slammed and my pizza's going to take 90 mins to arrive at my door, just say it, and I'll make sure to start the movie later so that I'm not biting into my cold pizza as the credits roll."}
