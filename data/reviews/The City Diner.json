{"text":"We ordered takeout this past Monday around 4:30 PM and glad we did as it was stuffy temperature wise in the diner when we picked up our order. Boyfriend got chicken soup with beef stroganoff dinner. Soup was excellent. Stroganoff was good not great and bit skimpy on the shredded beef, lots of noodles. I got mixed green salad with meatloaf dinner. I am a bit of a salad snob and was very impressed with the diced tomatoes and cukes and whatever else they put in - it was delish. Meatloaf was best I have ever had from a restaurant and they even had carmelized onions on side - was exceptional! Red skin garlic mashed potatoes were good but I could not taste the garlic. Veggie medley was el dente and unusual mix - nice job. Portions are good, was able to split mine in half to take for lunch next day. Bit pricey but we will be back to try different menu items."}
{"text":"First time here, we had dinner (pot roast and mushroom burger). Chicken soup was uniquely homemade. Appealing menu, very good food. Clean decor, friendly & timely service. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I just picked up some dinner, and it was great! I ordered the Bacon Macaroni & Cheese Bake. It came with a house salad which was a good portion and very fresh. The Mac n cheese was very flavorful and the garlic bread crumbs really made the dish. So excited to come back and try more food options! Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We have gone to the City Diner 3 times now and have had a great experience each time. The service has been excellent, and the food is delicious! This is not your typical diner food. Everything seems to be made from scratch with fresh, seasonal ingredients. It's a trek for us, from Cleveland Heights, but well worth it. A great place to stop for breakfast, lunch or snack if you're visiting the zoo."}
{"text":"A newer and must visit local diner! 

Atmosphere: Very clean inside and smelled good. Good music selections and a inviting interior. 

Service:
Very friendly staff, engaged in conversation and could tell they enjoyed being there. Very attentive as well. 

Food: The real star of the show, as it should be. Coffee was fresh and not bitter (one of the indicators of a good diner). Had the Westside omelette (like a western). Eggs were perfectly fluffy, ham was diced and seasoned properly, peppers tasted fresh-almost as if they had just been pulled off the vine, hash browns were seasoned well and not bland like some can be. Not sure what kind of butter was on the toast but it had a slight sweetness to it that gave great balance. 

Overall great place to frequent. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes but was disappointed. I had the Reuben which was ok, didn't give you 1000 island dressing and the fries were not cooked crisp. Hubby had the pot pie and the sauce was thin and runny, didn't taste like a pot pie."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I've been here twice now and their breakfast is delicious! My favorite part?  The warm applesauce and preserves they have for your toast! The two times I've been here it wasn't too crowded or too loud which is perfect for me. Definitely a place I will frequent."}
{"text":"My parents and I went to The City Diner for breakfast. We each got the 2 & 2: 2 eggs and choice of two breakfast meats with potato hash (hash browns) and choice of toast. 
We were all significantly underwhelmed. Each of us ordered our eggs over medium, specifically asking to have the whites completely cooked...as they should be with over medium. One of us got runny whites, one of us got our eggs correctly done, and one of us got hard yolks. The hash browns on each of our plates were cooked to a different degree, but were fine overall. The bacon was fine as well (I gave mine to my folks because I'm vegetarian). The toast was very disappointing. It was thin and tasteless, like wonderbread. They kitchen didn't butter the toast, we received butter at the table, so by the time we were able to butter it the toast was cold and the butter couldn't melt in. The toast was barely toasted as well. The highlight of breakfast was the homemade tasting jam, but because we had to spread our own butter on cold toast the jam kept sliding off the butter. There was a small amount of warmed applesauce with the breakfasts. It was a nice thought, but really more of a gimmick to make the breakfast seem fancier than it was. I would have appreciated really good bread for the toast, or a choice of different potatoes (hash browns are a breakfast copout if you want to compete as a great breakfast place). 
I'd like to go back for lunch...maybe. I'd heard good reviews of The City Diner, but was so disappointed in breakfast that I'm not sure I want to waste my money.
Also, the restaurant wasn't very full, there were three front of house waitstaff, and the service was poor. We kept having to wait and wait for someone to notice us. The waitstaff seemed confused as to who was to do what table, and they kept walking around without looking at the tables they were passing. You've got to be able to multitask if you're going to wait tables."}
{"text":"Just left the diner. Great breakfast. Great service. Very clean. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A number of friends rave about this place and I finally made the long drive to town and tried it.  I was not disappointed.
the food was excellent and the service was quick and attentive.  I had the pieroghi,homemade kraut and kielbasa.  it was perfectly prepared and very tasty.  I also tried the roasted chicken noodle soup and it was delicious.  this place is spotless inside and out (even the restroom was immaculate) Truly a place to try and try again.  As we were leaving, a young man who turned out to be the owner was going table to table to check on his guests and thank them for coming in.  you don't see that too often.  I had a brief conversation with him and was impressed by his sincere desire to please his guests.  my check for this awesome dining experience for my companion and myself, including tip was roughly $30  This is a must go to place for anyone looking for quality, service, atmosphere, cleanliness and value for your dollar."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food! Very flavorful. Service was great once we got a waitress. I think there was just some confusion between the 2 waitresses on who had our corner table. I had the sausage gravy and biscuits. The gravy was \"different\" then normal but still really good."}
{"text":"We Stopped in on a Lazy Sunday in Fall. The Breakfast was Very tasty & server  (Crystal) was spot on.. Great.I will truely share this Stainless Steel \"Lil Jem\" Diner to all..."}
{"text":"A beautifully done upgrade turns this diner into something really nice. The food was very good, with many vegetarian options. I got the veggie burger, which was sloppy but good. The tomato soup was also delicious. The staff could not have been friendlier."}
{"text":"Love trying new restaurants! Went here with my boyfriend- he got the roasted chicken noodle soup and it was SPOT ON. I had the black bean burger and they even customized it for me and held the bun and put the burger on a bed of lettuce- the peppers and onions gave it the perfect touch to make it taste beer like. The fries were alright- they were tasty but limp. I'll be going back :)"}
{"text":"Very consistently good food. Always order the skillet breakfast. Sandwiches also very tasty. Friendly owner and staff. Very clean--almost too clean really for a diner. Decent coffee. Great parking."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!  I got the corned beef skillet breakfast which was delicious with perfect amount of cheese and carmalized onions that were perfect!  My husband got the triple decker turkey club and loved it. Bread was fresh and homemade and the garlic spread was a nice surprise. Both meals were large and more then we could eat!  Definellty our new neighborhood spot!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on Saturday, 11/11/2017. The diner had no one there when we arrived at 5 p.m. , probably because it was Veterans Day. We ordered our meals, one of us had breakfast and the other ordered meatloaf. The meatloaf dinner was cold and instead of corn as was told, steamed carrot sticks were served; the meatloaf sauce was not tasty, real mashed potatoes were okay, maybe because the meal was not very warm. The breakfast meal ordered was supposed to come w/ three choices of meat; Canadian bacon was not available, so diced ham w/onions was served. Strawberry preserves were served with the dry rye toast requested. Doubt we will return. It is a clean diner, but we will wait until all kinks are taken care of."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Good service.  Been here twice. Portion wise, just not s whole lot-2nd time s better experience -Patty Melt was good.   Fries were decent -hostess said server would be over to take your breakfast order,  had to ask if they are doing lunch, which they were. Soup wss surprising bland. Seems like they have a lot of kinks to work out. A near empty ketchup bottle at booth minutes after opening for the day is frustrating."}
{"text":"The first 5 minutes were great, better than expected, even. Unfortunately, the 50 minutes that followed quickly disintegrated into a Mach 5 flat spin from which even Maverick himself could not recover. The end result was a hot, steaming pile of overwhelmed staff, disorganized kitchen, and obvlious management.

I'm about to accomplish two firsts for me as a Yelper:

1. Review a restaurant whose food I've never tasted
2. Bestow a 1-star rating

I was excited when I heard the rumors that an upscale diner-esque type dining establishment was coming to the food desert that is Cleveland's Old Brooklyn neighborhood. Unless you're into wings, light beer and fast food, your options are pretty limited in Old Brooklyn. I wanted them to succeed. Finally, about a month ago, they opened - and then closed for a little bit - and then re-opened. They did a great job with the space. Plenty of bright, natural light, comfy booths lining the walls,lots of table seating and even a more traditional bar toward the front. Pics of Cleveland hang on the walls and the place just feels comfy and clean. This part they got right.

We stopped in for our first visit at 11:15am on a Monday. As soon as we entered we were greeted by a cheerful hostess/waitress with an affinity for the word \"awesome\" who quickly showed us to a booth in the corner. The place was nearly empty. There was a party of 4 toward the back and another couple seated at a booth behind us. That was it. Great, we thought, we should get some pretty good service. Oh, how wrong we would be.

Our waitress took our drink orders and brought them out pretty quickly. We placed our food order - a cobb salad and a garden omelet with a side of pancakes and bacon - and that's when all hope vanished. As we sat and waited, we watched customers continue to come in and be shown to their seats. A party of two here, a party of 4 here. Pretty soon, there were half a dozen tables filled in what 30 minutes prior was a practically empty restaurant. We watched orders get taken, we watched frustrated people sitting there with empty drink glasses, and we watched others continue to wait.

There was a single server, probably fine when there were only a few tables, but she was quickly overwhelmed. After nearly 30 minutes we started to see food come out of the kitchen. OK, maybe they were surprised that they were open. The 4-top that was there when we arrived got their food. Then the couple behind us, and then, WTF, a couple that was seated 20 minutes after we arrived got their burgers. That was it. My wife flagged down the server and asked where our food was and her response was priceless, \"Oh yeah, but they got burgers.\" We didn't even know how to respond to that. At this point, I knew that our order never got placed or was simply lost. Without looking at us she wandered away toward the kitchen. We waited for another 10 minutes and she never returned to give us an update.

We had had enough. We were walking out. We wanted to pay for the iced tea and coffee that we had, but we stood there at the front register for another 5 minutes as a customer repeatedly screamed back to the kitchen, asking whether or not his take-out order was \"all there\". Finally, the hostess/server said, \"Don't worry about it,\" and we didn't and we left.

This visit was a complete disaster. We were there nearly an hour and we left hungry and very frustrated.

I want this place to succeed. If not for me, for the people of Old Brooklyn who deserve far more than cheap beer and chain restaurants. To this end, I offer the following suggestions:

1. Ditch the tablet check out at the tables. Watching a server bending over tables swiping on a tablet as customers sat there waiting is just painful. Tablets are great at food trucks, not in restaurants. Your customers will hate them.

2. If you ever have a customer that has decided to walk out, address the issue. Speak with them, find out what happened, just do something. Hiding in the kitchen is not an option. 

I don't know if we'll give them another chance. I want to, they have a menu with plenty of tasty-sounding items and they are very close to our home. Unfortunately, with so many options out there, second chances seem to happen less and less often these days. Perhaps, if we do pay City Diner another visit, and we actually get to taste their food, I can reassess my position. I'm open to change. Let's hope they are, too."}
{"text":"I was curious to see how our meal would turn out with such polarized reviews on here and we were fortunate to find ourselves on the most positive side of the perspective. We stopped in for a quick dinner at 5 pm on Friday and the restaurant was not at all busy. We mentioned our waitress that we were headed to the airport and she was friendly and efficient. Overall, the service was excellent. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the booth we sat in and even the bathrooms, they were clean to a higher level than I've seen in similar establishments. 

My husband ordered the triple decker turkey club, and wow it was so good. A large portion of turkey with avocado, bacon. The bread was perfectly toasted and the fillings fresh. He swapped his fries for hash browns and was very happy. Breakfast offerings for dinner area always a win! I had the cob salad without cheese and it was hearty and good. I thought the chicken was well cooked and flavorful. I added a side of fries for good measure and was quite happy myself. We look forward to returning to try some of the breakfast options and maybe the burgers."}
{"text":"Awful food that was way over priced especially for this neighborhood the food was not fresh and seemed to be prepacked food.

 The owner/chef was out speaking poorly of all of his former employers to the customers and when another table complained that the food was served cold the owner questioned their pallet."}
{"text":"The burgers here are required to have a knife to eat with...meaning...a good burger! It's interesting that the vegetables on the salad were chopped, but still enjoyable.

I'll go again."}
{"text":"They've been open for a while so I figured it was time to check them out. Arrived around 10am, was seated immediately. Place was pretty much empty. Ordered drinks and food - Old Brooklyn Special and Pretzel N' Cheese Burger. Was told that fries were a nogo until 11 and they'd substitute potato hash. How does one serve burgers before 11 without fries? Yes the website says 11am (the paper menu does not), but that includes burgers so I'm lost here. Then was told they were out of pretzel buns. We got our drinks and then sat for 30 minutes before the food arrived. At a diner. 

Eggs over easy were perfectly done, and completely unseasoned. Potato hash was disappointing in that it was barely cooked, unseasoned as well. The \"warm\" apple sauce was actually a nuclear hot, shot glass of apple sauce. The sausages were burnt on one side, and the rye bread (forgotten at service initially) was burnt as well. The burger was good and cooked well. Potato hash had the same issue.

These were not diner prices (knew that going in), but at these levels my expectations rise. I could excuse most of the stuff if the place was packed, but there were literally 4 tables in use.

Place was clean and the servers friendly."}
{"text":"This place was a little disappointing. The food was terrible. I only came to this place bc I was looking for a breakfast spot that was open earlier and this came up. The service was amazing however."}
{"text":"Food was decent. I got the grilled cheese and tomato soup and my friend got the chicken avocado sandwich. A couple dollars too much for diner food on each entree in my opinion."}
{"text":"I decided to stop here for a Sunday brunch on a whim and I left more than happy I did. The lemon curd mixed berry pancakes were better than I could ever describe. I think they were a special, but I really hope they become part of the regular menu at some point. I'll definitely be back to try their lunch and dinner options."}
{"text":"Really good food and a homely feel. Our waitress was so sweet, one meal wasn't agreeing with my stomach and o had to reorder and chose the tomato bisque. It was awesome and full of flavor 

The atmosphere was so quiet and Christmas time. Everyone was very nice and the food was good"}
{"text":"I've been excited to try this much-hyped, new diner in the area... and upon doing so, have mixed feelings. Ultimately, I think it will get better with time, as it's still very new and finding it's feet, and it has a solid foundation to build upon. But my experience was just ok, improvement is needed.

PROS:
- Clean and bright atmosphere, classic diner decor
- Friendly, if a bit green, staff
- mixed green side salad was fresh, nice for a diner
- great French fries and coffee

CONS
- found a big hair in the pot pie, had to have another one made
- main dishes were just ok (we tried the bacon Mac n cheese, chicken pot pie), I didn't finish mine
- service was a bit clunky 

I will give this place another shot in the future. Always have high hopes for a locally owned and operated business!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday morning. Had 2 different waitresses, the second was with us the majority of our service. I had the pecan waffle with bacon and my partner hand the old Brooklyn combo with some pancakes on the side. The service to get the food was a bit long. However everything we ate was very good. I would cook the waffle a little less for my personal taste. I don't care for a crunchy waffle. But we will be back again!"}
{"text":"So excited we have a great new breakfast spot in Old Brooklyn! Their omelettes and homemade fruit preserves are worth writing home about, and the staff is really friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great diner food with a twist! Just what Old Brooklyn needs! Get the party melt and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"City Diner was on our list of new local joints to check out, and we decided to stop in tonight for dinner. A bit different than what I expected, in a good way. 

They have a pretty eclectic menu in my opinion compared to the standard diner fare. It is a little over priced for the neighborhood. 

I ordered the chicken, bacon & avocado sandwich and my husband the mac and cheese bake with a side of chicken noodle. Soup was maybe a degree above room temperature but really good. Mac and cheese was very bland, but to be fair I think most mac that's been baked is. The chicken sandwich was really good, particularly enjoyed the garlic mayo. There's quite a few things on the menu that I'm excited about trying in the future. 

Service was great; friendly. It was pretty full when we were there, but our waitress was attentive and the service was quick. 

The whole tablet ordering system is a little awkward. It personally doesn't bother me, but the booth in front of us with an older couple was clearly frustrated about it. I feel it must be uncomfortable for the waitstaff to have to ask every one of their tables about their tip during checkout, too.

Overall, a good experience, a welcome addition to the neighborhood and will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Two co-workers and I went for lunch.  The place is super cute, but poorly executed.  The clientele was a mix from the heroin addict at the table next to us that the staff kept hugging to neighborhood people to workers out to lunch.  The food is kind of pricey for the area, but for a \"nice take on diner food\" would be acceptable, however, this was not.  My two coworkers got the short rib burger.  The hollandaise sauce was extremely questionable, basically like yellow mayo.  My one coworker ordered the \"mixed veggies\" instead of fries, I use mixed veggies in quotes as it was corn topped with sauteed onions and mushrooms that they use for the burgers, super sketchy, it also came out halfway through our meal.  I got the grilled cheese and tomato soup and added tomato to the grilled cheese.  The grilled cheese came without the requested tomato and the soup was really good, but probably something I could also pick up in a can at the grocery store. The service was extremely slow, our food took forever and we practically had to tackle our waitress to get our check. We were going to get milkshakes to take back to the office and passed on it because we were there well over our lunch hour.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great job City Diner! Clean place, friendly staff with a great neighborhood diner feel. I went safe on my first visit with the meatloaf. It far exceeded the standard meatloaf. You can tell everything is made from fresh ingredients with a great flavor. I travel a lot for work and places like this are a gem when you want real food at a good price. I will be back often!

ps - had the blueberry pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert, so tasty and fresh"}
{"text":"While the food at this restaurant is decent, even borderline good, the experience was RUINED by the blatant disrespect on the owners part. I called to ask a simple question, all he had to do was say no ma'am I'm sorry we aren't able to do that. Instead I ended up in an argument where this pathetic man screamed at me then proceeded to hang up. I'm disgusted at his business ethic and approach it's quite disturbing and straight up pathetic. I'm disappointed this man so completely ruined this restaurant for me but I will NEVER return & will ensure to let everyone know my experience. His attitude leaves MUCH to be desired he would've been much better off allowing someone with any form of ppl skills whatsoever to deal with customers because he is quite simply so unprofessional he should never have any contact with customers or people in general for that matter."}
{"text":"After months of anticipation, finally made it to the diner with a party of 3 other guests on this past Monday at quarter to 6. Just a handful of cars in the parking lot, not too bad for dinner time! Walk in, asked hostess for a booth. Despite the fact numerous tables were empty, we were told a 30 min wait.  Fine, new place, I'm understanding! We were asked for a name & phone # to wait in the lobby. There were maybe 5-6 tables in the whole dining room. Ended up leaving."}
{"text":"I'm super excited to have The City Diner in the neighborhood! I stopped in on a Tuesday (5 days after they opened) with a friend for dinner. At around 5:30, we were maybe the 5th table in the place and there were a LOT of staff there. It got busier while we were there but never full. Right when you walk in, the place looks great- bright mural, chalkboard wall, shiny old school diner counter. The main dining area is neat and clean, but nothing too fancy. 
The menu looks great- super diverse offering of diner-style food, though I'd say it's an upgrade in quality over the other diners in the neighborhood. They offer all day breakfast too! Prices for a meal run $8-12 with a few more expensive outliers. 
I had the pierogi dinner with tomato soup as an appetizer. The soup was delicious! The pierogies were solid too- everything seemed fresh and made from scratch. My friend had a burger which came with a generous portion of fries, and she enjoyed it. We shared the cait's cookie sundae which was fine- nothing special. 
Service- I'd say for their 5th day, they're doing OK. Our server was definitely still working on figuring out the tablet she was using to place orders and accept payment. It took a very long time to get our sundae. But everyone was really nice and attentive- my drink was constantly being refilled. 
Great to have another dinner place around, and I can't wait to go back and try other things from the menu- choosing was so hard!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like The City Diner. The outside is adorable, with a traditional shiny, silver diner exterior. In contrast, the inside looked outdated, like an old family restaurant. The service was average and the menu had a range of options from all day breakfast to sandwiches and hearty dinners. The waitress took our order on an iPad which caused some chaos because she could not figure out how to modify the meal when placing the order. I ordered the burger on the recommendation of the waitress. It was disappointing-bland and quite possibly a frozen burger patty. On the flip side the french fries were fresh and flavorful. The restaurant just opened in 2017 and I'm hoping they are just working out the kinks. The City Diner is just one of those places you'd like to see succeed!"}
{"text":"Stopped by The City Diner today to treat my kids to some yummy local fare. I've seen good reviews for this diner on yelp and facebook, and since it is near my parents, we finally made a visit. My kids were hungry while we were driving by, so I said, figured, \"Why not?\" We were the only ones in the place when we were seated. Our friendly waitress fetched drinks for us immediately.

Looking at the menu, it is evident that burgers are a prominent feature. So my daughter and I ordered just that. My son ordered his usual chicken tenders and fries. A while later, our food was served and it looked really good. It tasted really good too! My corn was tasty, but the star of the show  was the shroom burger with Swiss cheese. It was excellent. I'll be back again to try other burgers."}
{"text":"Their breakfast was amazing. Kim my server was very pleasant. The owner was very knowledgeable about his business and what the community wanted. Thank you for revitalizing the dinner and growing our community."}
{"text":"I had the cobb salad for lunch yesterday. It was very filling and the chicken was fresh and tasted amazing. I can't wait to try the other dishes on the menu. The owner is super friendly and you can tell he's very passionate about what he does. I would definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"We've had lunch there twice. Both times the service and food were great. I'm very picky and the pot pie and shepherd's pie were both excellent. Choice of soup or salad. Great addition to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"My husband and I were a regular when it was the Expressway Dimer and were so bummed to see it close. I am thrilled that Chef Ed has given new life to the diner! We have visited at least once a week since it opened and have never had a bad meal. The food and the people are outstanding. This is not your typical greasy spoon diner. You will pay more than $5 for a burger. But the quality of the food is outstanding and well worth the price. This is fresh, high quality food curated by a chef. My husband is obsessed with the beef stroganoff and I'm working my way through the entire menu. So happy to have our diner back!!"}
