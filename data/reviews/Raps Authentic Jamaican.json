{"text":"My boyfriend orders raps with uber eats to his workplace all the time, and they always deliver it fresh and hot with lots of oxtail gravy. The jerk chicken is delicious and the rice is good too. One of the best jerk places in Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"I consider myself quite familiar when it comes to Caribbean food as I have never been afraid to try out new places regardless of how shanty they look.  I had not eaten here in a while and decided to go back recently.  Perhaps it is different in the summer but I don't remember it tasting this good.  I ordered a large jerk chicken dinner which costs $12.50.  

I specifically asked for oxtail gravy on the rice which he put on generously then followed the owner to the outside bbq where there were a bunch of jerk chickens smoking/cooking inside.  He cuts it up in front of me and puts it in the container followed by gravy and some hot sauce.  It tastes really good!  There's a smokey taste due to it being in the bbq for so long and the sauces (oxtail, jerk, hot sauce) compliment the flavors well.  Next time I crave Jerk chicken I'm going back to Raps for sure.  

The place is also surprisingly clean (looks like it at least) and the staff (I always get served by the big Jamaican man) is polite."}
{"text":"I got the small jerk chicken combo which came with rice and peas. The shit was DELICIOUS!!! I could tell the chicken had been delicately smoked for a while because it was so tender and flavourful. It was served with a beautiful hot jerk sauce and the chicken was cut right in front of me off the smoker. I went there at 3 am and there was a funny crowd hanging around which is cool. The rice and peas absorbed the excess sauce and completed the dish. Oh ya...and it was only $6. Outstanding"}
{"text":"Not sure why people are making a big deal here!! Vistied the joint after I read the reviews and in short; I will never go there again.  Far away from the real Jamaican food especially Jerk chicken."}
{"text":"I had a craving for jerk chicken tonight, did a \"yelp\" search and found RAPS...  I would cross town for their jerk chicken!!!
It's that good..."}
{"text":"So we always go to Raps to get our jerk chicken when we are craving it. We went tonight and saw that the drum pan was not lit up and figured they jerked and had it all inside. When we wine inside the main server wasn't there and won't be back till March so they have substitutes.  We realized that these substitutes do not know how to cook or jerk chicken. The jerk chicken was sitting in a tray over hot water to keep warm. I had a feeling it wouldn't be good but I hoped I was wrong. I was right we bought a large jerk chicken with rice and oxtail gravy. The jerk chicken had no smokey flavor it was cold and wasn't cooked fully. The gravy on the oxtail tasted bad ad was salty. Needless to say we did not eat much of it and now we are sitting wondering where to go given that it is Christmas Eve and nothing is open. My advice to anyone who wants to go here is to wait until April to go when the main guy is back because that seems to be the only way to get good jerk chicken unless you want to try the other restaurants because Raps that do jerk also. 

Waste of my money and time."}
{"text":"Went out at 2:00 AM to this place, ended up getting some great chicken and at a  reasonable price. Chicken was charcoal grilled and crispy while retaining enough moisture on the grill to remain juicy also doused in a very tasty sauce. Also tried the jamaican patty, which was also very good, was much more moist and properly seasoned allowing for the actual taste of the beef to come through. Main gripe is the neighbourhood surrounding the restaurant not being the most cozy, but that could have to do with going at 2 AM."}
{"text":"I'll preface my visit to Rap's with previous visits to Black Hoof, Porchetta, the St L's Market, and Burger Priest all within about 6 hours, but this place is FANTASTIC. I only had the jerk chicken, given the full stomach my friends and I all shared, and it was super flavorful, tender but smokey, sweet but tangy, and overall satisfying. This was one of the top 3 visits we had on a weekend food adventure through Toronto. 

Six bucks for jerk chicken, cooked by a really nice employee dominating his huge drum pan, filled up with cooked chicken, and chopped up before adding a few ladels of homemade bbq sauce, was a great deal. He told me they're actually open till 6AM on Saturday night, and they were definitely out there when we swung by at like 10. Great place, can't wait to go back, recommended it to so many of my friends and even my full stomach smiled up at me."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken is amazing, fall off the bone. it's not very spicy though, but hot sauce is available at the front of the store. The oxtail is amazing and flavourful too."}
{"text":"Very good Jerk Chicken. If you're craving for a well seasoned jerk recipe or want a late night meal (these guys are open till 4 am), this is the perfect place to be."}
{"text":"This place may not be known for cleanliness but for the price and the amount of food you get you definitely can't go wrong. One of the best places out there hands down. Best part is their open until really late too."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. We ordered $15 of jerk chicken and rice and another order of stewed chicken and rice for $12 and we went to pick it up.  We paid and came home  and there was no jerk chicken in the container just filled with rice. This place is not worth  it. Completely shitty service."}
{"text":"Holy Rap the food here is delicious.

Super authentic and super delicious Jamacian food.  Very friendly staff.  If you don't know what's what (I didn't) just ask and they will explain what they have on offer.  The chalkboard menus aren't very descriptive.  

A small combo comes with rice & beans a bit of salad and a meat of your choice for $6.50 and is very filling. 

They also offer Oxtail & Curried Goat although it isn't listed on the menu.

The Jerk Chicken is divine, so tender that it's falling off the bone and perfectly seasoned.  Price is super affordable.  If you are in the area stop by!

They've also renovated fairly recently so the interior is very nice and inviting."}
{"text":"Authentic pan chicken from this restaurant.  You will smell the meat cooking before you enter the restaurant as the cook is grilling it up in a drum outside the restaurant.  If you must wait a few minutes for the chicken to finish cooking - it's worth the wait.  Try some fry dumplings or rice and peas alongside your chicken."}
{"text":"Came in to try the Jerk chicken. Wasn't able to as I was told I had to wait, as a large order was being prepared. Why would I wait for you to complete a catering order when you could easily prepare 1 meal, have me pay, then I leave? What if the place was packed? What would you guys do? You'd be screwed. Then you tell me 5 minutes later you might be out of Jerk chicken after this order. Wtf? The customer service is always sub par in Carribean restaurants across the GTA. Do better."}
{"text":"Effort was not anywhere in my meal. I've been disappointed a few times now so... That's a wrap on Raps. 
Cold, day old, yuck."}
{"text":"Can I say... AMAZING?? For $10, (they ran out of rice and peas at the time so I had to run next door to get some), I had a large rectangular take out box FULL of jerk chicken goodness. The guy manning the outside BBQ was a super sweetie, drenching our take out boxes in the home made gravy. 
Can't wait to go back again!! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious fall off the bone jerk chicken. 

Get it spicy - mix of two pepper sauces. 

No need for rice. Medium is plenty of food. Coconut drink is essential to rehydrate and help with the heat. 

Peace and lov mon!"}
{"text":"Really wasn't a fan of it.
The chicken tasted like gasoline. Almost as if the fire wasn't strong enough, so they threw lighter fluid on it to kick up the flames. Threw it out after a few bites. Add to it, food was served cold.
The festivals tasted as if they had been sitting there for a few days.
While I understand UberEats has paired with the company, and the company is often well-reviewed, this was among the worst places I've been for Jerk Chicken in quite a long time."}
{"text":"Best jerk in Toronto. When I get too sad that I can't get the roadside jerk I had at a random service stop on my way to Negril from Montego Bay, Raps always cheers me right back up! Thank you Raps for existing. 

Tips: 
Get it topped with the oxtail gravy
Always get the hot sauce, unless you're a pansy then just don't eat jerk 
Close your eyes and imagine you're enjoying your meal on the 7-mile beach with a cold Red Stripe anchored firmly in the sand, looking out into the ocean. 

Portions are great, sizes range from peckish to ravenous, something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I was not expecting much based on the location but I was very surprised. After some somewhat sketchy service, the cook came out with some of the best jerk chicken I've ever had on a plate of rice that was more than most could finish (Incidentally, I could). I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I'm a big jerk chicken enthusiast and this is by far the best place I've ever tried (that includes Jamaica). I've only tried the jerk chicken and curried goat and both are consistently earth shattering. I usually ask them to pour some curry sauce on the rice, because it's the best thing in the world. No joke, I can drink it! 
It's a takeout kind of place, but luckily I live really close, so I frequent often. If you're a girl 9 times out of 10, you'll probably get hit on by the clientele, or by the adjacent barber shop scene outside, but it's part of the whole experience. The guy behind the counter (maybe the owner?) is a sweetheart and blesses me every time he serves me. In the summer, the scent is so intoxicating since they cook the food right outside. It's hard to stay away."}
{"text":"I was glad this place opens late because I came here at around 930pm after work for some dinner! My coworker said this was the best Jerk chicken she's ever had and boy was she right!! I ordered a small jerk takeout and gobbled it up in a few mins.

The chicken was soft, tender and tasty! Downside is that you gotta watch out for the bones but that's ok! It was cooked to perfection.
Along w the chicken were some coleslaw and rice w beans with oxtail gravy drizzled all over it. Mmmm mmmm mmmmmmmmmmm. That oxtail gravy was soooooooo yummmy. I'm still thinking about it! 

The lady at the counter was also really nice ! 

I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This dude knows how to make chicken. Juiciest chicken around. Keep in mind this area operates in a different time zone so the later in the day you go the more there is and you can even get a haircut when all other barbers are closed. Street parking is free after 6pm. Open late night too. I like the fact that the chicken is not spicy unless you get the spicy sauce on it. The place has been recently renovated so the inside is more inviting than before. It's fierce competition with the other 2 jerk joints but Rap's is king on eglinton (I've tried all 3). Prices are not low but no Jamaican places are anyway. You can spend less you just won't be full. The chicken-only is decent deal tho. Make sure you go when the main boss is there. He can usually be seen behind the jerk drum in front of the store"}
{"text":"Coming here for the first time and left empty handed. I just left the restaurant. We have been standing there for 30 minutes with no acknowledgement we were there. At first there wasn't anyone but us... minutes passed, nothing and we stood there like fools for 30 minutes. I understand there was a large order, and uber drivers kept walking in. But 30 MINUTES??? Asked us for our order and we answered 3-4 times. Our friends talked how good this place was... but honestly. Gave up and left."}
{"text":"We heard a lot about this place so thought why don't give it a try..
So we wanted to give our order in the front it took almost a half a hour to get it done. The cc machine stopped working and I think it was a new worker there on the cash
The lady beside here( I think she was the owner ) instead of helping the cash lady she just stands there and looking around ...
BTW half of the menu was not available.
So after 40 we finally got the food got the table 
We ordered some bread and then chicken and rice with beans.
The bread was okish full with oil.
The rice was very good tasted very nice but then the disappointment with the chicken I think jerk chicken supposed to have a Smokey flavor which this chicken didn't have at all the marinate on the chicken was very nice but after one bite you could taste it was not Smokey at all. 
I think they boil the chicken before putting it on the bbq.
It's more made for takeout"}
{"text":"Didn't love the food. Just ordered from here through UberEats and found a piece of plastic wrapper in my rice. I feel like it could have potential if you get the food fresh, but knowing it was prepared in a careless manner has dampered the overall experience for me. I posted a picture of the plastic in the tips section."}
{"text":"This is probably the best jerk chicken ive ever had!! The chicken unlike the place beside it (hot pot) and many other places leaves this smokey flavour in the chicken. The chicken is fall off the bone and good to the very last bite. Normally i get the med jerk chicken with rice which is $10 including tax. If you like spicy ask them for the pepper sauce(hot sauce) they put on it! I used to go to jerk king on bloor as my go to place but now its all about raps! The only downside its the wait time is a bit longer than other jerk chicken places and is in a sketchy area but it is still worth the wait and the hassle of interacting with the homeless people and crackheads outside asking for spare change."}
{"text":"With a hankerin' for some authentic jerk, I thought I'd give Rap's a shot. After reading the reviews, I had to try.

Well, it turns out I didn't have a great experience. I'll try it again in the future but I chalk my less-than-perfect experience at Rap's up to the fact that I got there right at noon.

Due to that fact, I assume I was served yesterday's jerk. Nothing was ready except the jerk chicken, oxtail and plain white rice and they wouldn't sell me a Festival because they were stale. When I got back to my office, my work bud's serving of chicken was literally twice that of mine. Although it really was tasty.

Sorry Horace! Maybe next visit, I'll be able to bump ya a couple stars."}
{"text":"Amazing Chicken!!! Cooked in the barrel right out front. Always busy, awesome staff and super fresh food. Dumpling and festivals are fresh and a good size. Portions are good for the price as well."}
{"text":"Wow how did I not know if this place sooner.  The Jerk Chicken at Raps is amazingggg. Best of all this place open till like 4 am!! Ony bad thing is the sketchy area Raps is at. People outside at 2am coming up to me trying to sell me stuff was super weird.  I wouldn't come here alone.  You order inside the store and they give you the box and you go outside and line up for your chicken."}
{"text":"I swear this place is always open when I go. On Uber Eats they delivered at 4 am at one point!

If you need a late night grub this is definitely the place to order from.
I've had their oxtail, jerk chicken, dumplin, and festival.
Everything is well cooked, well flavored..just delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Its a shame I only discovered them recently. For someone who loves jerk chicken as much me it pains me to admit that I've yet to taste the real thing (from and in Jamaica) but I can say for certain that raps knock it right outta the park. Seasoning and that hot sauce MY GOD is it phenomenal. 

 I find that every Jerk chicken in Toronto is unique in its way but these guys do it how I like it ... Straight from the BBQ. Yes I've had days where I could taste/smell the lighter fluid on my chicken LOL but it still doesn't deter this snob from licking his fingers and wanting seconds. 

Love the ordering system. Pay up get an empty box go outside and get your chicken off the grill. My first time there I was confused and wasn't sure if should ask why I'm being handed an empty box haha but I was pleased with everything nonetheless."}
{"text":"Ok folks!  This is the best jerk chicken in the GTA...but there is a catch.  You have to go later at night when they start grilling outside the store.  I'm not sure exactly what time they start but every time I go it's dark out.  If you go for lunch...it's most likely last nights batch.  Might be a good idea to call and ask if they're cookin' jerk outside.  So the drill is to go inside and order.  I usually order $10 chicken only but you can also get a combo that includes rice.  Then you pay and they hand you a container and you go back outside.  The grillmaster then opens the steel-drum-charcoal bbq and pulls the jerk chicken out and chops it on the board and places it in the container.  He then asks if you want jerk sauce...say yes...then he says hot sauce?  I say yes!  You can then go back inside and eat.  They are one of the only places to grill jerk chicken with  charcoal...this is why it tastes so good.  The key is you have to catch them while they are cooking fresh."}
{"text":"If anyone doesn't think this is the best jerk in the city come and see me, but you better come swinging.  

You do have to go there after 10 pm when the chicken is being smoked proper, and I don't suggest you go there and just chill (due to the potential of being shot).  But roll up quick, get a container inside (I usually get $10 worth of chicken and i feel good), then go outside where badmon is chopping it up, fill it up, say god bless and dip.  

I also suggest you undue your pants as well in case you get the sudden need to masturbate to this chicken...I'm sure it's an occupational hazard for those who work there (might even be what makes the red sauce so damn horny)."}
{"text":"Sweet Jah, this is good! for 12 dollars for the large combo, you get a generous helping of beans, rice, gravy and chicken that is chopped up by a large Jamaican man on the grill outside. The spice was great but not too overpowering and everything was so filling. Also you are across from \"Treasure Jah Island Records\" for all your Reggae needs."}
{"text":"TL;DR I've never had any blander jamaican chicken than this one. It tasted so bland with no aroma of spices, barely any kick to the face, and the edges were beyond burnt.  

This chicken literally tasted like they blanched it, threw it in a grill with some bland ass salt and sugar rub with some pre-packaged \"Make your own Jerk! with this pre-mixed spice package!\" that was probably $2/bag, and then ppoured on about an ounce or two of watered down tobasco sauce (i ordered spicy).

Not only was the jerk chicken smelling like it should, it tasted like water. The last time I complained something tasted like water it was some shitty rice at some shitty 24/7 chinese joint. Like no.

Do yourself a favour and if you're gunna order from here don't. I'm sokad at 4 a.m. I decided to waste my time and money on something literally a 4 year old could do better with any knowledge of Jamaican cooking.

How do any of these uber places have 4 stars??? I swear the last 10 uber eats I've ordered I've given them 1 star and that's generous. 

I've learned my lesson; if it's listed on uber eats, don't eat there cause it's gauranteed disappoint served on a plate with a hefty price to pay. Zzz //UNINSTALLED"}
{"text":"Damn. This place is very good to your tastebuds. First of all, it's amazing to wait by a drum barbecue while they cook the jerk chicken and you get covered in amazing barbecue smell. Then, you watch this guy chop it up while your mouth waters all while you are standing on Eglinton West (and in my case it's 1AM and a lot of interesting people are walking by....sometimes stumbling lol). Once I got home and ate it, I was happy as a peach. Sometimes rice and beans can just be starch blah, but this rice and beans mixing with the jerk chicken and beautiful hot sauce makes magic. I WILL BE BACK [in arnold voice]!"}
{"text":"Best Jerk in the city. Hands down. Cooked 'Island Style' in a large drum BBQ outside. The meat falls off the bone. Very limited seating."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and the whole place was empty. I was a bit nervous, but once I had my first bite of the jerk chicken, I immediately knew why this place has so many high ratings. The jerk chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The meat falls right off the bone. The bbq sauce and coleslaw gives the chicken a new dimension of flavours and texture. The small size was definitely more than enough for me. Parking is free on the neighbourhood streets behind the store. Or it is about a 5-10min walk from Eglinton west station."}
{"text":"Nice simple place with VERY affordable prices. I really enjoy seeing how they make the bbq right in front of the store."}
{"text":"Love coming here to satisfy my cravings! Best jerk chicken and oxtail ever! Perfect for the late night cravings! Reasonable portions and prices."}
{"text":"Probably top 3 jerk chicken in Toronto... maybe the best! Now that they are delivery with ubereats I haven't been able to get enough!"}
{"text":"I hate to give Raps 3 stars because his food is pretty amazing, which is why I ordered the \"massive\" portion, I feel like starvin' Marvin as I write this review because what I received was a wee portion on meat(most of this portion of the container was just bone, no meat on it)at least the meat was masterfully seasoned , a large bit of rice  n' peas, and to top it off a masterfully done slaw'.  I don't want to directly place Blame on raps , just because I ordered through UberEats and am not fully aware of how the app works on the vendors end, but I'm sure he could of canceled the order after realizing he was unable to fully bring the goods. Back to the portions though, as I type this I lay awake craving food!!! I would be eating as opposed to watching Netflix and typing a Yelp review if I was sent the stated amount."}
{"text":"Raps is a mom and pops Jamaican restaurant located in Little Jamaica. Little Jamaica runs from West of Allen Rd to East of Keele St in Toronto. 

Little Jamaica once a bustling area with Caribbean restaurants, grocery stores, barbershops/beauty salons and record stores is slowly changing due to gentrification. Rising rents and the ongoing construction of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT are a few of the reasons contributing to the decline in the neighbourhood. One mainstay fixture in the community over the years is Raps restaurant which has been there since 1982.

I went there this past Saturday to grab some takeout. There are a few tables inside but everybody inside was there to grab takeout. I ordered a small jerk chicken dinner ($9.50 including tax) and a large oxtail dinner ($16.50 tax included) both came with rice and peas and coleslaw.

The oxtail was pretty good, nicely seasoned and pretty tender, rice and peas and the coleslaw were pretty standard. 

The jerk chicken was outstanding, definitely one of the best in the city. Nice and tender on the inside but it's the outside skin that makes it amazing. Really nice seasoning and sauce and it's got an amazing smokey flavour from being cooked outside in the oil drum. You only get that smokey flavour from cooking the jerk chicken in an oil drum. Not a ton of places in the city use that method.

If you are looking for authentic Jamaican food and amazing jerk chicken, definitely hit up Rap's. It's open late every night (until 3am Sun-Thurs and until 5am Fri & Sat). It's probably not the most ideal place to dine in but definitely a place that's worth getting take out."}
{"text":"I'm currently on a Jerk Chicken craze and trying to try all the joints I can. 

I came across this from Google and decided to give it a try as it's somewhat close to my work. 

The restaurant itself isn't the most eye pleasing place but I could tell they cared about what they were serving

I got the ox tail which was a large and came up to around $16 which was a little pricey for me when I was simply aiming to get the stew chicken. But the portions is great! There was so many pieces of ox tail in my box and a huge amount of rice and peas which I loved. 

The lady who served us was very sweet and didn't seem miserable serving us. 

The wait time was a little long (waited about 15-20 minutes for my food) but other than that this place was good!"}
{"text":"Not a place I go to during the day but late night when they start smoking the meat outside on the BBQ it is as good as it gets in Toronto....Jerk HAS to be done on a coal BBQ to get that taste you get in Yard...will never taste as good as you get REAL chicken in JA but this is about as close as it gets

NEVER go to the spot a few doors down just to save wait time, they are not nearly as good

They cook until 4-6 in the morning so this is THE alternative to McDonalds if you are willing to drive

Whoever decided to keep them open until extreme late night is a genius....luckily I live right beside the highway so the drive is not that big of an issue 

I usually just get the $10 dollar chicken, load it with the sauce they have, add some hot sauce, and remember the times in Ochi"}
{"text":"The best and most authentic jerk chicken in town. I often stop after clubbing to get some jerk chicken. Actually, I go out of my way. I have Jamaican friends who wouldn't eat jerk chicken from anywhere else but Raps."}
{"text":"Ordered curry goat the first time I visited a it proved to be pretty good with hot sauce of course.  

Jerk  chicken with peas and rice was the second dish I tried another time.  Not entirely a fan of chicken legs as a personal preference.   Didn't find it as  flavourful as I it could be.  

Dumplings are delish  no doubt.  

It is also quite nice they have the BBQ outside cooking as it adds a more autheitc feel and character to the area."}
{"text":"Lots of reviews on this place and we were really excited to eat here. We got the oxtail,  jerk chicken and chicken soup.  Oxtail - soft and succulent but we only got a small portion with a ton of rice. Jerk chick -  disappointed. It looked and smelled amazing but was dry. Soup -  not bad but I've had better.  I think for the price you pay, there should be a larger portion of protein.  Really friendly staff though and I wish I had a better review to give."}
{"text":"We were driving by this place and noticed the smoking bbq and smell at the front door of the restaurant so we had to check it out. Got the grilled  jerk chicken with rice which was fantastic.  I will definitely have it again if I'm in the area. However that's about it. I don't think they have anything else in the menu and the restaurant is not the best place to eat at (in terms of decoration, setting etc.) so if you don't expect a proper restaurant and want take out this is legit bbq chicken. The price is also very cheap! 

Food: 4.5/5 (just had the chicken)
Price: 5/5
Atmosphere and service: 2/5
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"Good place to pick up quick take out dinner. I visited here 4 times so far and it's a decent place. They have freshly grilled jerk chicken and tender ox tail.  However I think this place is little over hyped. I been to many other Caribbean places in TO and they are better than this place.  If you happen to be near by, try it out but don't make a separate trip to visit here. There are plenty of other good Caribbean places in TO."}
{"text":"Located only a few steps from Marlee Avenue, which should have been called Marley Ave, considering the Caribbean cultured area, where else would you expect to find the best jerk chicken!?!

And their 'best' jerk chicken is incredibly tender, well seasoned and loaded with sauce.  I personally prefer my jerk wet rather than the traditionally dry-rubbed style.

I've returned to Rap's many times and even brought friends there; after my trip to Jamaica, I've been hooked on the jerk spices... I've even started a collection in the cupboard and fridge.  

But nothing ever compares- this is the best jerk chicken I've ever had... including what I was served in Jamaica!  

I will always stop in here if I'm passing by, even if just for take-out to toss in the fridge and reheat later!"}
{"text":"Awesome jerk spot. In a whole in the wall of Toronto. Best jerk chicken my girlfriend and I have ever eaten, and she's a chef. We were going to check out the annual jerk fest but got there and it was 15 per person to enter when it used to be free, So we went on the hunt for authentic jerk. We found raps on Yelp and were on our way 25 min drive. When we arrived we ordered a chicken dinner small and a side of chicken. We got the rice and coleslaw and had to wait for the meat as it was being made fresh in front of the store on a bbq. After 10 minutes we both received generous portions of chicken. We were both stuffed and loved the flavour and the overall experience. Definitely coming back here. Friendly service and fresh food."}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the years..
Interior looks better .
I'm not a big fan of cold food. Makes u wonder how long it's been sitting. 
Plus over 11 bucks for medium sized dinner?! 
I'll go somewhere else next time. 
Plus it's winter, cold outside and inside. 
Some poor kid at the cash with a HACKING cough, bad experience at RAPS."}
{"text":"This place is not for the faint of heart. Don't come here alone if you are skittish. You may not make it out of here alive. It's probably scariest to visit this area after dark but that's the only time you should visit. This may be your last meal but is it worth it? YES! Absolutely.

I've had my fair share of Jerk in this town. I have scoured the city in search of the best tasting jerk and I think I might have found it.

Raps is different from the rest. One bite of this chicken and you will know why. This stuff is tender, juicy, flavourful and damn! it's smokey! All of this goodness wrapped in a crispy, crunchy, grease-less skin. You know this is the kind of stuff that only an old school charcoal grill can deliver.

Best damn jerk chicken in the city!"}
{"text":"At the end of any late business trip drive home from YYZ, I've held off on many an airport dinner for my late night Rap's. 
Every time I go, you can count on a huge grey cloud of smoke and chicken smell, within an awesome giant oil drum. 
Cars, locals, cabs and just hungry folk will walk up and grab some food to go. Forget sit down. Eat while standing, or leave. 
Don't bring your attitude. This place is honest good authentic Jamaican jerk. The best I've had in TO."}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss.
Foods either fresh or its not. 
They hardly ever have anything except the jerk chicken. 
The curry goat is more like curry goat bone - you'll be lucky to find a nice piece of meat in there. 
Festivals are always stale. 
When its good - its been really good, and its open late, but very often, its not good."}
{"text":"Unf.  Who knew sketchville could give me such amazing jerk chicken?

Careful not to travel to this area alone.  I think this place opens from 7pm to 4am - the hours of this resto pretty much reflect the overall calibre of area haha, but... the jerk chicken is DELICIOUS.

You order inside the shop, we got just the jerk chicken alone plus a meal - which comes with rice and coleslaw (they ran out of coleslaw that day though, so we ate our own when we got home haha..)  After enough people ordered inside the shop, the owner comes out of the store to get the chicken out of the grill outside, and cuts it in front of you.  While in line though, expect to be approached by a few homeless people - not for the faint hearted

The first few bites were not too spicy.. after a few minutes though, a slight burn sets in.  But a delicious burn at that.  It's like an explosion of flavours in your mouth and likely the most flavourful chicken I ever had.  Not to dry not too oily.. all kinds of Jamaican perfect."}
{"text":"Friendly smile right when we walked in! We had the oxtail and jerk chicken, servings were packed in and delicious! Priced fairly. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Good chicken?tasty ox tail, fair price, but dont try the \"dumping\" is doesn't have any filling inside but just a deep fried dough"}
{"text":"Went in and order a Large Jerk Chicken and went home and ate the meal. Everything was fine until 10m after the meal were done. Been puking and run for washroom like 30m or so now. Food poison is no good. WILL NEVER EVER COME BACK AGAIN!"}
{"text":"The chicken is moist and full of flavour. The skin is perfectly crisp and there's a nice smoke flavour in that little Styrofoam container. It's also reassuring to actually see the man on the oil drum BBQ outside on the sidewalk. The place definitely lacks the refinement of more gentrified neighborhoods, but the authenticity of this place is something you definitely can't call into question. The rice and peas could be a little tastier, but the jerk is on point. If you're in the area and you're looking for a late-night nibble, definitely skip the drive-thru at have some jerk."}
{"text":"This place is a gem all on its own dating back to a decade ago when dates with hubby were on a budget but never lacking taste. Always gotta be worth the allowance the parents shell out since it's either food or clothes so theorizing choices is ideal.

I got hooked one summer's night of 2003 when I was driven at 2 am after a house jam to this very famous jerk chicken master, hubby refused to fall prey to my combo cravings with upsize the fries at Mcds so he felt a bit bad ass showing me the ropes of late night munching.

Well, Rap's has been the witching hour's main grub served fresh from the grill and that sauce is just brain freezing without ice because WOW! Is it ever hot??! Always burning my tongue like amnesia kicks in after the aroma fills the car.

I honestly think the guy grilling 'em overnight has been the same one ever since and hey!!!! He gets it right like I get me when I stock up on icecream before my monthly visitor hits me up! 

I always get the $20 worth of jerk chicken, beautifully laid in 2 styrofoam containers. One for the ride and one to be devoured at home or if it survives til early morning, these served on garlic rice and eggs overeasy starts off the morning perfectly."}
{"text":"Awesome Jerk chicken! 

I've tried many, many places around TO for Jerk chicken and this is my number 1. 

The chicken is ridiculously good, it comes straight from the BBQ, It's slightly higher priced than other restaurants in the area but for good reason. 

The staff are great, super friendly and very cute! 

I live in the area so the crackheads and homeless people don't bother me at all. I'm used to them but if you're not from the area, beware because you will be approached and asked for some loose change. They are harmless, though. 

If you want really good Jerk Chicken, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Awesome jerk chicken..plus they're open super late! Best late night food in the area!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night at about 9:30. What can I say, great place to come for a jerk chicken craving. Totally satisfied with the serving portions & tremendous flavour. 

Rap's has been around for a while and well known to people around the area. It is also known for being open during late night hours (up to 4am). Great for late night quality food cravings that go for a decent price! Upon arrival, there is fresh chicken being bbq'd outside of the resto. Smells amazing!! The Bbq drum piping hot is sure to leave an amazing scent of Bbq on your clothes & get your taste buds aroused. 

I ordered a medium order of spicy jerk chicken with beans and rice with a side of coconut water. The first bite, makes your mouth water! As you cut into the jerk chicken, it falls right off the bone, and you can tell that it's been seasoned to perfection, very moist, tender, and yummy!  The chicken is saucy over the rice. They also drizzle a little gravy on the rice which is perfect so the rice is not left so dry. Also comes with a side of coleslaw on top of the rice which is good as well. The spice was pretty spicy, but not too too spicy where it'll affect your experience. If you can handle spice get spicy, if not medium or mild (no spice) will do. 

My only downside...***EXPECT a long wait. It seems as though Ubereats has priority as they have to fulfill the incoming orders as the uber drivers are eagerly waiting for the staff to quickly rush to make the orders. If they're making a fresh batch of chicken, the wait is long BUT WORTH IT. Don't be discouraged to try this gem out because of the area it's in. It's not the best area, but hey, for the food, it's well worth the trek! 

Verdict- would definitely come back, would recommend this as the best jerk chicken joint I've tasted by far! Must try."}
{"text":"I would have given it three stars up until my last visit, but I can't endorse a business that appears to have random incoherent people working the room. I've gone to the place on at least half a dozen occasions over the last few months, and have always ordered their smallest jerk chicken meal, which usually amounts to $7.50 plus taxes. Tonight the usual pleasant staff were nowhere to be seen, instead, a random dude who looked like he walked in off the street appeared out of the kitchen speaking nearly illegibly, with absolutely zero business acumen, wanting $4 more for the same small meal. Perhaps this is what they think is a clever business gimmick, as they suspicously don't write the prices of their smaller meals on their chalkboards, but it amounts nothing less than a sketchy business practice in the real world. Even on its good days the meal consists of almost nothing one would consider true \"jerk chicken\" in its seasoning and flavour, however the oxtail gravy and rice and peas are a bit better than those found at their multiple competitors in either direction along Eglinton."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Jerk chicken now.  My only regret is that I didn't get enough hot sauce.  Myself and 2 other guys ordered 1 large Jerk chicken meal, 1 large Oxtail meal and 1 family sized chicken!!  Next time, more hot sauce on the side.  Peace and love!"}
{"text":"The throwdown is on! Oakwood Village (Toronto) is the home of one of the best Jamaican Beef Patties. The place is iconic and has been around for decades. The Place is Randy's Patties (I'll review that next time I visit). But also on this strip of Eglington the home of three popular Jamaican joints that serve up jerk chicken into the wee hours of the morning. In fact, they don't start serving until 18:00 (Jamaican time, so it's really anywhere between 17:30-19:30 and I recommend that you don't come until at least 18:30). Regardless of when you arrive, expect to wait, there's always a line. Always.

There is metered street parking as well as a Green P nearby; and you can probably find free street parking on the adjacent streets. The area isn't the best, and the locals can probably smell fear, so don't show any of it. Service doesn't really exist even though there are tables, the business is 99.99% take out. The three restaurants competing are less than 100' apart. They are: Hot Pot, Raps, and Spence's.

All three places serve a variety of Jamaican cuisine, saltfish (cod) and ackee, goat, ox tail, plantain, rice and peas, etc. but the focus of this throwdown is JERK CHICKEN. All three places serve it the same way. You go into the restaurant, line up to order, pay, and receive an empty take out container for your chicken order. The prices are all the same for the same size containers. Small is $5, Large is $10. Cash only. Bring exact change.
Your container is simply filled up. No measuring, no weighing, your portion is what the chef puts into your container.

There are basically two elements to Jerk Chicken; there's the flavour of the chicken itself (spices and dry rub), and the flavour of the sauce that complements it. For all three places, the chicken is cooked in the ovens inside the restaurant and finished off on the charcoal grill outside. Wood chips are added for extra smokiness. Your order is served \"Street Meat\" style, the chicken is removed hot off the grills, chopped up, and put directly into your container. Sauce is optional, but if you get it, they put it directly onto the chicken (no separate containers)... you can't beat street meat!

Raps jerk chicken consists of full chicken legs only (no breasts), a typical and good choice since the dark meat contains more fat (for flavour), and retains more moisture so the meat doesn't dry out. It also contains more bone, and it's much cheaper than chicken breasts (good for the store, not so good for the consumer).

Being a purist, I needed to taste the chicken naked and sauced, so I asked for sauce only on one side of my container. The chicken was fully cooked, moist and tender as would be expected from dark meat. The skin was crispy and burnt in some areas, despite the lack of a flame on the grill.

The rub was excellent. Tonnes of flavour, allspice with hints of garlic, pepper (chipotle), chili pepper (not flakes), cloves, thyme, and probably at least 5 more. There was heat, but not enough to make me sweat. The crispy skin and the tender, juicy meat, was an absolute treat to my taste buds. 4,5 stars.

The sauce. There are two types, mild and spicy. I went for the spicy. There was definitely some heat here, but not too much that your tastebuds would be destroyed. While it was tabascoey, it wasn't pure tabasco. I didn't taste any flavours of Habanero, so it was most likely to be Scotch Bonnet. The sauce was runnier than gravy, yet thicker than tabasco, a good consistency for the dish. Other than the heat, the sauce did not do much to enhance the flavour of the chicken. 3 stars.

Overall, I pretty impressed with Raps Jerk. The flavour was infused into the meat and not just on the skin. I definitely preferred the naked chicken to that of the sauced chicken. 4 stars overall.

Next up: Hot Pot!

{"text":"Best spot to get jerk chicken in the city! Open very late on the weekends. My only complaint is that the wait can take a while if a new batch of chicken is being made but it's so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The only place I go to for authentic jerk chicken outside Jamaica. Great portions, well priced and open late!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place a million times but never figured out why there's always a block party here. Now I get it.

Raps Authentic Jamaican is a lively restaurant with a BBQ grill at the front of their store and always surrounded by neighbourhood foodies. Once you order your portion inside, they give you a box filled with slaw and rice and then you proceed to the front of the restaurant outside to get your chicken.

I didn't really understand why they would have a scale to weigh your chicken. They cut up the peice you order and don't cut up another peice when it doesn't weigh to their standards.... 

It's definitely one of the better cheap eats in the city. I ordered a small jerk chicken that comes up to 6$ and I was stuffed!

Definitely will be back¬!"}
{"text":"I will give this restaurant 3.5 star. Their jerk chickens are good quality but the special sauce makes it even better. I have not tried anything else beside jerk here although you can get other carribaian foods like Oxtail curry, fried fish, pineapple soda drinks etc. Pricing for jerk here is decent. There is a small dining area and paid parking nearby. They do offer delivery by Uber for few bucks extra. One thing i love about this restaurant is that jerks are served right off the grill which is located in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night bite to eat because I wanted something with a little kick. I got the Jerk Chicken and it was AMAZING!! The flavours was perfect and juicy, and not to mention fresh. I did have to wait for about 10 mins for the chicken to be ready but I rather wait then have dried out chicken that has been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. The rice and beans were cooked to perfection (not to soft and not to hard) and the coleslaw was a nice added touch. 

I will for sure make my way here if I am in the mood for some jerk chicken."}
