{"text":"What a disappointment!  I hadn't been able to come for a while and they no longer have the cute decor on the walls and they took the baked potatos off the menu!  And it wasn't clean and the booths had rips and it is extremely expensive for what  you get"}
{"text":"This burger was cooked to perfection,  served on a delicious roll and the taste was fabulous!   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went with a family of 5 and paid around $50 for burgers, fries and drinks. You can pick the size and how they prepare the burger. They also have options of chicken, buffalo, turkey and elk. They have 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3 lb. You can build your own or get a specialty burger. I got a 1/3 lb med done burger meal. The burger was cooked perfect and tasted good and juicy. The fries were seasoned wedges. The seasoning was good but may have been a little over seasoned. One of my kids didn't like the fries at all. The bun is buttered and grilled and they have a small topping buffet. Over all food was good and wasn't too expensive. The place wasn't busy. We ordered and had our food in about 5 mins.The kids meals were around $5.25 and includes burger, fries, drink and a cookie. We don't live too close but was worth the drive and will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times before and the experience was pretty good.  It seems to have taken a turn for the worse, however.  We went there tonight and the place smelled awful.  It smelled like old eggs and mayonnaise and the floor was dirty.  The cook had dreadlocks, tattoos all over his neck, and the girl at the cash register couldn't be bothered to take our order.  We walked out pretty quickly & went to Famous Dave's down the street."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger place in the Madison area! I had the Kobe burger which was wonderful. The ambience is very lively and the staff are friendly. I'm so glad I found this spot."}
{"text":"Their chicken fingers were the worst I have had in years. And they are a bit pricey too."}
{"text":"After my last visit, I have to wonder why anyone would spend their money at this restaurant.  With the many FINE quality burger joints In the area, this by far is sub par.  Once a nice place to take the family is now run by a crew of misfits starting at the top.  When taking one step in this eatery it's painfully obvious there is tension among the staff, making for an uncomfortable experience from the get go.  I over heard fowl language from \"Savana\"?  I believe her name was.  When I have a small child with me this is not what I want them to hear.  I asked another employee who was tending to the condiment station who was the manager and they pointed to a short blond young woman who's appearance left something to be desired.  I decided then & there I would observe before speaking with her...just as I thought.  She too conducted herself like a child & not like a leader. I have spent the better of 30 years in a profession where I was required to notice small details. These details tell a lot about a person, situation or environment. Fuddruckers fell short in all areas. If the \"feel\" is off when u enter a place the meal is less enjoyable. I hardly noticed the quality of food because i was so put off by the first 10 minutes. The food was somewhat enjoyable, but nothing like it used to be. I feel as though if I'm going to pay 12 bucks for a burger meal, it should be served to me. (I can go across the street & get a nice steak dinner for 10 bucks!) With that being said, if everything is spectacular, these are the little things I'd over look. The charm of the place, if u will...I can get a cheaper, better tasting burger in 5 other places with in a mile of Fudds.  Overall this place need a complete makeover from management to menu.  If u don't care about your restaurant then why should I?  I sure hope this place can be saved,  it once was a great fun family spot!"}
{"text":"Alyssa will definitely hook it up with the best customer service of all time!!! She definitely deserves a raise!! Holla back!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at Fuddruckers in several years, and was looking forward to one of their gourmet burgers.  Unfortunately the food was average, the table dirty when I sat down in an almost empty restaurant, and the bench seat was broken.  Hopefully this experience was indicative of a poorly managed location rather than an overall decline in the chain."}
{"text":"Some family members and I decided to try out the new Fuddruckers. We were a group of 10. They were very accommodating and moved an area of tables together for us. We were getting our food quickly and pretty much all at the same time. Everything was going well...

One person ordered the Naples Grilled Chicken Salad. When she got to the table she realized that the chicken was pink in the middle. She returned it right away. The new salad came out, this time it didn't have the apples on it. The manager quickly retrieved apples for her. She had eaten a couple of pieces when she realized the middle of the apple chunks were moldy. Yuck! She did not take the time nor make an effort to return anything again.

Another person ordered a turkey burger. After jazzing her burger up, at the self-serve condiments bar, she cut it in half to reveal the burger was very pink in the middle. We all agreed it shouldn't be that way. Upon presenting the burger the person behind the counter simply took the basket from her and walked away. She was left standing there with no direction. She finally had to ask if they were remaking her burger and how would she know when it was ready. They gave her a number and sent her on her way.

Most of the other meals were okay and as ordered. I must say the bacon on my burger was almost sliver like in the middle. I'm not sure that's the best way to describe it, but that's what it felt like in my mouth. The chicken tenders were tough, a bit over done.  Apparently the strawberry shake is quite good.

I did like the self-serve condiments station. It was well maintained and appeared clean and fresh. It also gives you an opportunity to try different things you may not normally try. 

I've said this from the first time I ever had Fuddruckers - \"You should try it once.\" Make up your own mind. My mind says I won't be back anytime soon. 

I'm giving this 3 stars because 6/10 meals correct and edible - isn't bad???"}
{"text":"After a hockey game, we saw a sign for Fudruckers.  It advertised burgers made with ostrich, boar, elk, and american Kobe.  We thought fantastic!  Let's try this place out.  After waiting in line, we finally get to the register to order.  They don't have ostrich.  They don't have boar.  They don't have Kobe.  Really?!  We were very disappointed.  But since we were hungry, we went ahead and ordered an elk burger and a bacon cheeseburger.  When they asked how we wanted them cooked, we both said medium.  After a 15 minute wait, we received our burgers.  They were both very well done.  You get your own condiments in a salad bar style.  Kind of gross as people had their hands all over it, just grabbing things without tongs. Ew.  Beside being overcooked, the burgers were bland.  We were disappointed.  And when you factor in the price, it was definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Last time i will ever come to this location i will drive further for better service. Worst customer service by cleaners. Especially the kid with the glasses Sunday night at 7pm"}
{"text":"First time being at fuddruckers. Basically you order at the cashier and you get the burger and add your own condiments. I ordered the hangover 1/3 burger (came with bacon, cheese, and egg. 1/3 burger was a good size. Nice to have the condiment bar and add however much you like. The burger itself was a little over cooked, the egg too. And it was a little on the salty side. Other than that the meal was pretty good. The potatoes wedges I ordered where seasoned just right."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened, this used to be my favorite place to eat. The quality is not the same. The shredded lettuce is not shredded, the fries are not seasoned like they used to, and my burger was not cooked the same. Bun was good."}
{"text":"Good gone BAD!! This place was alright when it opened but...now it's dirty and they have a bunch of kids working there with no respect and no idea what they're doing. Sad!!"}
{"text":"I've had more than a few people recommend Fuddrucker's since I've started my blog, but I somehow always forget about it when I'm trying to figure out where to eat. When craving for a burger the other day my girlfriend mentioned it and it sounded like a good idea at the time. This review could very well mark the first time that I planned a revisit before I even left the building, and not because it was so good I knew I had to go back for more. Why did that happen?

Fuddrucker's has two locations in the Valley; I went to the one in the south west side of town located in your average shopping area by a Target, Sears and other typical crap. The interior is kind of country kitchen meets a Hawaiian theme or something; it doesn't make a whole lot of sense and is nothing fancy or great. Also, most of the patrons reminded me of the folks I spotted the last time I visited Farmer Boys; think your average Wal-Mart customer. The menu offers a few different sized regular burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads and other things, but the items that are going to draw me back are the 'exotic' burgers made with either elk, buffalo or wild boar. More on that in a bit.

I went with the 1/2lb Original which comes with 100% USDA all-American, premium cut beef with a sesame bun with a variety of toppings available in the self-serve bar. This self-service bar is a scary, buffet-style presentation of wilted lettuce of the large slice and shredded variety, sliced tomatoes, peppers, onions and a few other items. There is also a sauce 'island' with ketchup, mustard, cheese sauces and a few other selections. I decided to keep it very simple and went with just lettuce and tomato so I could sample exactly what I was given. This was probably a mistake. The meat had bad flavor, was overcooked and dry. The thick bun was also dry and didn't have great flavor. The cheese, lettuce and tomato were all just ok, and didn't do anything to improve my burger. This burger sucked; I quickly realized that the draw could be the wild game burgers and I suddenly wanted to come back and try one despite the mess that was sitting in my hand. Mind you, this probably won't happen any time soon.

The fries also completely sucked; they were dry, generic and just not that good. They had some seasoning but it really did nothing to help the flavor, nor did the variety of sauces that I tried. From the outside I thought for the longest time that this was a slightly 'fancier' sit down restaurant similar to a Red Robin or something, I had no idea it was more or less a fast food restaurant that just served terrible food. Our meal came to $24.41 which is far too much for a crappy fast food meal for two. I will be going back at some point to check out their 'exotic' meat, but despite what so many of my readers have said, I would recommend staying away from here."}
{"text":"Fuddrucker's is fantastic! Have no idea what these people are saying about roaches and crumbs on the carpet (blah blah blah) burgers are delicious and the buns are even better!"}
{"text":"Great service and a good place for a birthday party!! The Arcade area is really fun to, but the claw machines are rigged () . But over all, Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I dont think we will be returning. Although we love the food our time has been wasted the last 2 visits. :(  The first of two visits consisted of a hair in the shake and rude customer service. Today is took 40 min for 2 burgers that were nothing special a 1/3 pound the other 1/2 pound. But yet another friend with us had no problem getting his that he had ordered after us, along with 4 other guest after us. For some reason it seemed we continued to get skipped over. Even the 1 pound burger and bison burger got theirs before us. We finally had to tell them to just make it togo, as we only have an hour for lunch. So we had to eat our burgers cold, with soggy fries. Ultimately it is impossible to eat here with an hour lunch break, as they constantly seem to be under staffed, especially for the last day of school being today. 

I guess we should have just ate a freddys...."}
{"text":"Fuddruckin good! Got the original and made it my own way with their topping bar."}
{"text":"My Garden Slider cooked medium rare was very rare, and the blue cheese over-powered any flavors from the sautéed vegetables. The \"sliders\" was a 1/3 pound pattie cut in half, wrapped in iceberg lettuce leaves with sautéed veggies and blue cheese. I would not order it again. My husband had a bacon cheddar burger also medium rare, but his was cooked truly medium rare, and he thought it was excellent. Fries were skin-on thick cut wedges and soft--good. They welcome children with video arcade area and even child-sized handles to leave the restroom!"}
{"text":"2 burgers, 2 onion rings, 2 drinks = $30?  Why??? Ordered:  1/2 lb chili burger w/grilled onions. 
Not too difficult, right? WRONG!! 
Received: 1/2 lb burger (no grill marks or taste) which looked like those frozen, robot formed burgers you see in the grocery store. BLAND!! A salad dressing sized cup of what they call great chili.  NOT!! Oh, and (2) raw red onion rings on a giant, non-toasted bun. BLAND!! Not so great customer service. The counter person was unsure of what a chili burger was!! I'm going to in&out! C-ya"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 25 years,  when I came in I was greeted with a smile from Karla who was working over a hot grill,  Veronica then took my order and made me feel totally welcome,  Jose served my order to me with kindness and much respect, manager Adam spoke with me and made sure that everything was great,  I deal with many people on a daily basis in customer service,  and people can be so rude and mean, keeping a good attitude can be difficult and the people who took care of me today went the extra mile, as with everyone that I saw who came through the door. Great job guys,  I hope you recognized for all that you do! Scott."}
{"text":"Gone down hill compared to past visits. Difficulty with keeping condiments fully stocked. Not a long line yet it took a while for the order to be completed. When checking on order noticed that the cooks enjoyed each other's company more than task at hand. Yesterday the phones were out while grills were on and had their attention. The food is still good but service still needs work."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger and the meat was pink inside.  Showed the cashier who just shrugged it off."}
{"text":"So yesterday in around 9:00 in the morning I was still half asleep with my sister so I ordered an order that was four 4.99 But when she got our order and went back to the room the order was 6.99! I told my sister this was wrong. So I was okay because maybe I was wrong. she threw the receipt(I thought she kept it) away and then when we got to basket Robbins to buy ice cream with my mom. I looked the menu again and I was right! I got so pissed off at the worker and my sister. This time I'm taking of the receipts this time you'll never know if your getting cheated out of ur money. So looks at it carefully! When I got my meal it was okay but it wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Burgers are always good (beef, turkey, and veggie) but, during the most recent visit (January 16, 2011) to this location the lettuce in the side salad was \"rusty\", the ranch dressing was water-like, and the onion rings were over done. Sorry but, I will not be going back to this location any day soon...  

I also found it \"odd\" that it seemed like there were only \"kids\" working in this location, without any \"visible\" adult supervision..."}
{"text":"It's a burger joint nothing more sadly I don't go there much. Reason is I find there burgers very very greasy and unimpressive. For the cost I would likely go some were else sadly."}
{"text":"Good hamburgers and very good steak sandwich. One very nice feature is the help yourself topping bar. Nothing special on it but its always super fresh."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for 4 months to go to Fuddruckers. It was one of our favorite places to go for burgers in San Diego California. However it's far from where I live. So today March 25th 2016, I came out to summerlin to eat here finally. Boy was I disappointed! The place was very dirty & the food wasn't good at all.  Our buns on our burgers were stale & the frings we ordered tasted like dirty oil & precooked then redipped when we ordered them. There was absolutely no seasoning on the burgers or fries. Our food was cold & they had barely any produce to put on the burgers. It was 6pm on a Friday night & the restraunt was very empty however alot of the tables were dirty with dishes on them & not wiped down. I had to ask the girl at the register if they could wipe down our table! Her response was we do when people leave were are you sitting & what tables are dirty? My response was almost all of the tables. The cheese sauces were dripping all over the sides of the containers, the coke machine was dirty & very sticky. The floors are horrible with sauces on them. Bathrooms are just as bad. After eating my burger only, without the bread, I told a worker that came to the table about my experience with the bread & she talked to the manager then told us he doesn't know why they gave us stale buns, when they have fresh ones that they made today. My whole thought process of this Fuddruckers is horrible. It ruined my whole night out especially driving 30+ miles to get here. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Five stars for the service speed & burgers!!!! Love the exotic meats section!! Oh and the free ranch lol"}
{"text":"I used to love this place growing up as a teenager now I just like this place. The burgers are still good but I really question the weight of the patties? I ordered a 1/2 pounder and I just woofed it down like nothing and this isn't the first time it's been like this the past few times coming here. And then the wings are so few?!, an order that costs $8.00 and all my daughter got was 6 wings?! It's a wonder how they stay in business. The service though was great, the staff really seems to try hard to please, I always remember to bring some loose cash to leave as a tip on my table but I would like to eat here more often but I just don't see the value in it anymore, sad. I won't be back here for a very long time, unless my daughters really bug me to come."}

By The Rue

On the court I'm like a praying mantis,
When the kids and I are in the Bahamas,
We stay at the Atlantis, 
Before I eat at Fuddrucker's
I don't smoke the cannibis. 

Here you can get a beer but not saki, 
I usually love Fuddrucker's,
But this time my bun was soggy,
I got the 1/2 pound burger combo,
When I got back to work I was groggy, 

Flipping burgers with a spatula,
You can add cheese or grilled onions,
Saw a guy who looked like Scott Bacula,
Had to do a double take,
No it wasn't Count Chocula,

There were a few hotties eating lunch, 
Tight jeans with sparkly things on the back,
Tried to catch their eye, their burger I'd munch,
Looked away before the boyfriend saw me,
In my money maker he surely would punch, 

I love that they have jalapeno nacho cheese,
Build your own topping station, 
I shred on a snowboard and even on skis,
Is that really necessary in this review,
I won't even stop when you say please.  

BEDAZZLER!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for something quick after playing a hockey game up the street and Fuddruckers didn't disappoint. The restaurant was pretty full including a very large group of soccer players and our group of 7 still got all our food cooked perfectly and promptly."}
{"text":"Microwaved veggie burger. The place smelled like a wet kitchen floor...not a clean one, either."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food, love the jalapeño cheese with everything. Also good place to eat with the kids when it is not too busy. They have a few arcade games to keep them entertained."}
{"text":"Twice I've tried to eat here, and twice I've been so incredibly infuriated. I'm so mad I don't even want to write a review, but I feel it's my duty to warn my fellow humans of what terrible, overpriced garbage they are trying to pass off here. DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, fast and clean place.  Onion rings were a little over cooked, but everything else was good.  Buns are homemade and tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with our two little ones. It had been years since we have both been to a Fuddruckers. We liked it. we both ordered well done and that is what we got. We liked the fries and my daughter liked the chicken. it was not crowded at all for lunch which was cool. I will go again if I ever have a craving for a cheeseburger again."}
{"text":"Restaurant was very empty on a Saturday night.  The dining room floor was very dirty.  The food was ok not as good as previous visits.  The main reason for the two stars is the cooks behind cashiers were cursing up a storm   Great words for a 10 year old to here f this f that loud could not be more unprofessional.  Will not be returning."}

{"text":"Not the best burger by any means, but passale   Horrendous setup by the drink machine almost impossible to get by because it is so crowded and tiny aisle to go past"}
{"text":"My experience was bad across the board. I work as manager of a nearby hotel and wanted to try this place to see whether or not recommend it to my guests. Well I won't. First off, my cup was dirty, had to go back and have it changed. Second, the quality of burger versus the value ($12!!!!!) was not that great, even my son did not like it. I could not even taste the pepper jack slice they charged me $1 for. Come on, we are in Wisconsin and you charge me a buck for cheese????? I'd expected the food to be over the top, instead was just average. On top the staff did not seem to be helpful, or smiling. Bleah!"}

Will NEVER come back to this \"burger \" joint again. $22 for 2 burgers and a drink- NO THANKS. This place has surely changed for the worst. Red robin next time!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Fuddruckers several times over the many years it has been open, and always found their burgers acceptable - or O.K.  But after a  2-3 year absence, I returned with my daughter and granddaughter on March 14, 2014.  My daughter ordered the Swiss burger, and my granddaughter and I ordered the cheddar-bacon burger, and we shared a large basket of fries.  The burgers were nothing short of fabulous, you could almost drink them.  I don't know what changes Fuddruckers has made (if any), but all of us thought they were one of the best hamburgers we had ever tasted.  They have upgraded their soft drink dispensers and now offer a huge variety including cherry-vanilla Coke.  I am a cheeseburger nut, and I would rate the burgers Fuddruckers is now putting out among the best, if not the best.  And for the quality of the burgers being served here, the prices are very reasonable.  I will be going back a lot more often."}
{"text":"When you want a burger and don't feel like Wendy, Mcdonalds etc, grabbing a burger and fries here is pretty good. The burger is made to order and the bun is great. I really like the fresh topping bar with lettuce, tomato etc.

Having a little cheese sauce to dunk my fries in is a a bit difference. While I wouldn't want all my fries like this, a few does the trick.

I took a bite and of my wife's hot dog and was really good. The hot dog was grilled well and had nice flavor. The bun was also tasty.

Coke products are served here.

The service was fast the decor on the wall is different, but cool.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Go here when you feel like treating yourself to a good, greasy burger. I like that you can order different size burgers, so it is the right amount of food for you. It is a family environment, great for kids which games and a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been to Fuddruckers a million times since I was a kid. My dad loves it, so when I come here it's usually with him.

Their burgers are pretty damn good. I have tried the buffalo & it was ok but I will stick with beef. I have also had the grilled chicken sandwich & the salmon filet sandwich. The grilled chicken is bomb but the salmon filet was nasty. Their regular fries & onion rings are great but the sweet potato fries suck, if you want yummy sweet potato fries go to Fez! They also have some delicious shakes & baked treats if you still have room.

This isn't the cleanest location I've been to, but the staff is friendly & I love the condiment & toppings station."}
{"text":"My daughter called them to see if they sell their hotdog buns. She was told yes by the girl who answered the phone.  I drove all the way over there to buy 4, yes only 4, buns and they wouldn't sell them to me.  I would have had to give 24 hours notice. Ridiculous. Why weren't we told that on our initial call. Horrible customer care. Won't be back for ANYTHING from this place until they change to honest management.  The manager told me she only had 2 hotdog buns on site. Really? At 5:00p you had no fore thought to make sure your establishment was stocked for the dinner hour. That's really awesome management skills at work there. 

So I'm the daughter who made the \"initial\" phone call. I've worked in the food service industry for 10 years.  Never in my life would I allow a customer to walk out the door empty handed after one of my employees told that customer that they could place that \"to go\" order. The employee who answered the phone actually placed me on hold to ask the manager on duty (aug 31st) if they took orders to go for their hotdog buns, she returned to the call and told me \"yes we sell our buns to go\" me replying \"ok I'm on my way I'll see you soon\" and the employee responding \"ok I'll see you soon\" After making the 20min drive (40min round trip) we were told that they would not sell us any buns because they didn't have enough for dinner, this was after watching the manager pull down a tray of 10+ buns and returning to us then saying they only had two buns and would not sell us any. After explaining the situation even further the manager became extremely rude and somewhat hostile. I will be taking this issue to corporate bc of the EXTREME unprofessionalism. 


See photo::
We ended up going to Frys (no joke) they had the same buns. All you need to do is ask the bakery (who is fabulous mind you) and they will guide you to these buns. Just spread a little butter on the outside edges and toast them like you would a grilled cheese sandwich. 
Our goal tonight was \"clam boats\". You butter and toast up the bread filled then with clam strips, coleslaw and a garlic aioli!! Yum yum and you have a clam boat. 
Avoid the headache and poor customer service and head over to Fry's two blocks away. Their bakery and customer service is like sipping a pina colada on a tropical sunny beach.. and you don't need 24hrs notice!"}
{"text":"Really? While I normally dine with a group of associates, today I wasn't dressed up and went alone to a) see if they had gluten-free options, and b) to use a birthday burger coupon (for a 1/3 lb burger or entree of equal or lesser value). I asked the employee (Mike Schultz ; he deserves kudos) if they had a gluten-free menu, or an allergens chart. He was a champ,graciously tracking down the manual and searching for the chart.One of the first few items with no allergens was a buffalo burger. A line was forming, so I said that would be wonderful & handed him the birthday burger coupon. A buffalo burger is 1/2 lb not 1/3, so technically it wasn't an option. Not wanting to hold up the line, I offered to pay the difference but that of course my priority was to not get gluten. He needed management approval for this exception & THAT'S where the problem started.The mgr Dan huffed, rolled his eyes & approved the modified order (for which I was paying), then in front of the now forming line explained in juvenile fashion that buffalo is a very expensive meat. He then turned on his heels, walked a few steps, then boldly ANNOUNCED: \"THAT'S THE LAST BIRTHDAY UPGRADE!\" In short order the burger was nicely presented on a giant, plate sized lettuce leaf. While sitting @ a table (because there was no rock to crawl under), more than 3 customers commented to me about harsh treatment. While the burger was tasty, I read the table ad for all the delicious meat varieties; ostrich, elk, wild boar... YUM! I'd happily bring a group of associates for the fare EXCEPT: I'd never subject anyone to even the possibility of such treatment from management. The issue could have had the same result without abuse. The place was however immaculate with the exception of a crud covered ketchup pump. The employee was a champ, but the management was a chump."}
{"text":"I have only been here 1 time and that will be it for me. I gave 1 star because there is no room for a negative. I love burgers and asked for mine to be well done. They had trouble with that. My biggest problem was that the burger did not taste like a good meat it was fatty . I guess my 1 star will go for the onion rings. and when the waiter picked up our baskets he asked how the food was but did not stay around for a reply, if you're gonna ask stay for the answer. Oh well that concludes this. I get great burgers in my area but not here sorry I expected more,. maybe a good meat if that is what you are selling."}
{"text":"We love these hamburgers because they always use fresh cuts of beef. The burgers are always juicy! The toppings are healthy and fresh. The fries are wonderful. Fuddruckers also bakes their own bakery items for dessert. It's a great place to go for a casual bite to eat with friends or family. 
The service has always been extremely polite and ready to help when needed."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here, everything is always fresh and condiments are good and fresh.They have a complete range or items you can add to your burger. the staff are very nice and can help you with anything.also they are very friendly. Decently priced and family friendly. 

Great place to watch a game. all the burgers have a nice taste. they have a really short line!!. also they have great hosts.The establishment is a good one. You can build your own burger here. anything you want.Bathrooms are clean.

Coupons often make it easier to come here more often. Also children eat for free on Monday. another reason that this is a good place is that it is not that expensive and you get really good burgers.
Definitely recommend if you're looking for a good burger joint !!!"}
{"text":"Yummy burgers and fries! My guy loves the elk burger, but I'm not that adventurous - I stick with the bacon cheddar burger. It's do your own condiments, which works great for me as I can completely customize my burger without sounding like a scene from When Harry Met Sally."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I don't get out there as often as I'd like, but it is always worth the trip. I'm rather shocked to see some of the poor and ludicrous reviews. Seeing as I've only purchased the hamburgers, I cannot review any of the other menu items. That being said, the hamburgers are the best. They are a bit expensive, but the gigantic meaty hamburgers, huge buns, and unlimited toppings make it worth the price. I have never had a bad experience there. Don't believe the negative reviews. Or my review for that matter. Try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Had a great time with family and friends here. Forgot to take a pic! Had the ultimate grilled cheese and sweet potato fries. Awesome!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We need more Fudds in the valley. Their burgers are great. The produce is always nice and fresh and it's all about their cauldrons of pumpable cheese sauce. Writing about this is making me hungry. Im heading to Fudds now. See you there."}
{"text":"The burger was ok, but none of the surrounding tables were bussed and there was litter all over the floor - napkins and other stuff. The pic I posted tells it all."}
{"text":"This is what I'm talking about if you looking for a good burger tasty and you don't get any stomach ache after it's going to be this company very good burger very big size for 6.99 you can put anything you want on it I do highly recommend to get this burger this company amazing thank you"}
{"text":"came by for a quick lunch. Great staff and fast service. the food was very good, condiments looked fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"Been to the one inside the Orleans and wanted to not hassle with parking and the food court atmosphere... This place is really nice. very clean inside and not the typical kitchy decor like the others. The food was excellant. I had the burger. Food for 4 came in 10 minutes...Always tell from the quality of the condiments... They looked like they have sitting there for a little while. But we were there after the usual lunch rush. It all was a good experience, worth the drive from the NE..."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go if you're in the mood for something above Whatta Burger, but not as pricy as Red Robin--it's a great middle of the road burger joint. I also like that I can get a good sized side salad for $3 while my husband gets a customizable burger for $10 or $12 (depending on if he's feeling in the mood for bacon).
The service at this location is fast and friendly--clean family friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been coming here since this location opened. I don't know what's been going on but in in the left few Monthes it's been going down hill.... The focus has been on remodeling adding free style machines etc, yet the quality of the food went down. I used to get frings, but now the onion rings are terrible I get fries but the portion is so small....the chefs forget you are supposed to season burgers even when I ask for it with the fry seasoning... I don't care if a restaurant it's a little less than maintained, but do NOT sacrifice the food quality EVER. I hope it's just a short term contract with a bad supplier, because if things stay this quality and still these prices the neatly empty restaurant will probably closed soon enough sadly...."}
{"text":"I don't go here often but when I do you'll find me sucking on the cheese pump.  'MERICA!"}
{"text":"- Food Poisoning Alert -

Wife and I ate here for lunch on Saturday 8/26. We ordered the same size Burger and fries. The only difference was the self-serve cheese sauce. She had only a little, I had more.

My wife was \"lucky\" in that she later only had a bout or two of diarrhea. I on the other hand had several bouts of passing digestive acid all through the night. Excruciating, burning acid. All night.

In other words, a form of food poisoning.

I know it was this Fuddruckers that caused it because my wife and I frequently eat the same meals, and around this same day (give or take), the biggest/only variant was the amount of the cheese sauce we each had. (Unless the cook used tainted utensils to handle our cooked burgers, and mine got the worst of it.)

I'd get a lawyer and sue for the intense pain I was caused, but proving food poisoning isn't easy (lucky you, Fuddruckers). But I know myself, where/what I ate, and thus know that this Fuddruckers caused it.

I'm posting this review to warn others, as well as a reminder that there are countless other burger joints to eat at if that's what you're in the mood for.

I'm also posting this in the event that others also experienced food poisoning around the same date after eating here. We should talk."}
{"text":"Just sad how this franchise killed my opinion of this restaurant chain. Quality has gone down drastically since opening. A great burger does not give excuses for poor service and quality. This is my last experience here.... one of my 3 combos of half & half included 3 onion rings and 14 fries. My expectations as a customer that has had Fudd before... 5 to 7 onion rings 20 to 25 fries. No combo my family ate today met my expectations. Dirty tables. Dirty restroom. Dirty floors. Nickel & dime the customers."}
{"text":"Great hamburgers and specialty burgers. They have a great condiment bar for adding your own toppings. If you don't want a hamburger they offer grilled chicken, bison, or buffalo burgers also."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. 

One time they did have a sign in the line that said, \"8 minutes from this point\", like they were disneyland or something. 

But the burgers are good, and the fries. and the cheesy sauce is good for dipping."}
{"text":"arrived at 9:30pm when they clearly closed at 10pm according to the posted hours on the window. door was locked and the 2 employes inside just stared at us, couldn't even come to the door to apologize for closing early. won't be returning."}
{"text":"We always liked Fuddruckers in CA, so when we got one near our home in Las Vegas we couldn't wait to go have a great Burger. So we go to the Fuddruckers at the Grand Canyon Mall with high hopes. The day went south when what I thought was fly out of the corner of my eye, turned out to be a cockroach on the back of one of the chairs, the Ladies with me were a little freaked out. I went and called over a staff person, and nothing. So we went and found a Manager. And he could also not care less. Their whole attitude was like why were we surprised to see a cockroach? Ask Chipotle how that is working out for them.

We may go to a Fuddruckers in CA, but I doubt we'll ever go back to the one at the Grand Canyon Mall. 

(Note to Managers: All you had to do was pretend you cared and would take care of it)."}
{"text":"The place is upbeat and nice. The food  comes out fast and it is fresh . They give you a lot of food ."}
{"text":"As good as it gets in the burger and fries department.  I dream about the chili cheese fries you can eat with a fork.  The fries are fat and soft and lightly seasoned.  I always get breaded and fried onion rings and slices of fresh avocado on the cheeseburger and it truly is heaven.  I like how they opened up the space in the old Cheeseburgers in Paradise location.  I has a fresh feel and the kitchen looks impeccable."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. Jalapeño cheese pushed me over the edge from a four star to a five. Nice addition to Middleton."}
{"text":"Monday's are the days to goto Fuddruckers.
Kid eat for 99 cents. This is one of the few places I'd give 5 stars for the burger. I like the small burger with fries and drink. The nice thing is, when the kid are done eating they get a free cookie. Been years since I've been to a Fuddruckers. I'm happy to see they're still around. They must be doing something right. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the Fudd. Their fries are meh but the burgers are outstanding, and I appreciate being able to dress them exactly as I like 'em - cheese sauce, A-1, mayo, and just enough lettuce to give it some crunch.

Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Great selection of meats from beef to wild animals. Fries have a spice to them which are delicious and they have a bar of tons of condiments for your burger"}
{"text":"Eat here about every couple months. Prices and service good, like the self serve condiments.3 stars because I've noticed a decline in quality of beef since last visit. Meat has always been consistent until the other day. Hamburger looked and tasted as if frozen and premade elsewhere. I will give one more shot."}
{"text":"This place rocks, not only is it newly built (yas) but the food tho it was poppin i got a basic burger and the fact that there were tvs everywhere this place must be loaded on game day, total american resturaunt, i love the custom soda machines too  some vanilla sprite make it all bettah"}
{"text":"We went there last Saturday and we enjoyed it. I had the 1/2 pound Original Fudds with only cheese. It came with steak fries and I liked them because you can really taste the potato in it and just the right amount of salt. The burger was well-done and they got it right. The burger was very juicy, and succulent. The bun was soft, fresh, and lightly toasted. The meat was cooked very good, because it was beefy, and juicy. The cheese was fresh also, and added flavor. The service was good, because they asked us how we were doing and that was pleasing. The quality of the meat was good. It was cooked on a grill and was never frozen. They had a decent arcade in Fuddrucker's that's good for kids 5-12. They also have a very cool soda machine. The soda machine is touchscreen and say for example you press Sprite. You see regular Sprite, plus a whole variety of flavors. I tried Sprite Strawberry. It was refreshing. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is that it's overpriced. We had a party of 4 and it costs us $49"}
{"text":"Overall, food was great. Would prefer to have toppings already on the burger but noticed there was a topping counter. They also had a tip jar that read, \"feeling tipsy\" lol...thats awesome. Cashier could have been a bit friendlier."}
{"text":"Our family went into this location for a yummy, reasonably priced burger on 12/28/15. The food was great but the place was filthy dirty, the pop machines were empty of most flavors, and one poor lone employee was trying to sweep the floors. Lot of employees there, whether it was their job or not, they should have helped clean the place up. People aren't going to eat at a filthy restaurant."}
{"text":"Mushroom Turkey Burger was pretty good!  Order took kinda long for a slow period. I waited about 20 minutes.  Will go back but maybe phone order first if can."}
{"text":"I had my first Buffalo Burger and I really enjoyed it. The condiments are layed out nicely and the potato wedges are nicely seasoned. I would like to see ranch dressing or honey mustard sauce made available for dipping the wedges in. I was glad to see plenty of A1 and Heinz 57 available for the burgers."}
{"text":"Excellent Burgers/Fries.   Although I also enjoy Red Robin for the occasional burger, I like Fuddruckers better.  This location is particularly good, clean...great service...fresh toppings, great seating,  etc.   I just hope more folks discover it...so it remains."}
{"text":"I have been to Fuddruckers before and enjoyed it.  This was our first visit to this location.  On 4/24 nine of us dined here and within a few hours eight of us were extremely ill.  The one person that did not get ill did not eat a hamburger.  Upon our first call to the restaurant to report the issue we were told that we were not the only diners that had complained of becoming ill that evening.  The second person we spoke to challenged how did we know that we became ill from their food and not something else.  Well for your information it was the only meal in common that we had all had that day and we all became very ill within a few hours of leaving your establishment.   When  we reached out to the cooperate offices we were told that their risk management group would look into it.  So basically I paid you to make me ill and lost a day of work.   I don't even think that I would have been as mad if at least one person would have used their customer service skills and had been decent enough to apologize and let me know that they would look into it, but I guess that would be considered acknowledgement of wrong doing."}
{"text":"Awesome food, staff is friendly, the cashier I forgot her name but both arms are tattooed she's got dark hair she's awesome super friendly bouncing all over the place she does everything never see her not smiling she's on point with her health codes always  washing her hands making sure everything is sterilized.. she's amazing and one of the reasons I continue to eat there because I'm a stickler when it comes to health codes being in food industry my self.. my wife likes the hamburgers we both love the Phillies I prefer the hotdogs and they're onion rings are phenomenal... Plus who doesn't love free nacho cheese and free jalapeño nacho cheese!!!!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Briana's review.  I also ordered my veggie burger rare medium, i got it really fast.  Till i put it in my mouth, it was practically burnt ti a crisp.  I asked if they would remake it and they did.  The waitress later told me she mixed up thr order.  My moms buffalo burger was just fine. Their buns are unusually and unnecessarly large. The side of wedges were really good.  I will be back for more yum."}
{"text":"I used to go to Fuddruckers 20-30 years ago when I lived in Phoenix. It was great back then and it's still great. Haven't been back to Fuddruckers in 10 years. It still has the best burgers!!!  You get to make your own. It's great. Wish they would open one in the Seattle area."}
{"text":"Ordered a Buffalo Burger and employee Brittney said you can have that like any of our specialty burger ways so I requested the 3 cheese way and then she tried to charge me more than the Buffalo Burger was advertised. I said the Buffalo Burger is $9.99 and she said I have to charge you extra. I told her that you told me I can have my Buffalo Burger any way and did not say I had to pay extra. I asked to speak to the manager and she gave me a dirty look. The manager Maria said well it's extra and I stated what happened and she was rude and did nothing. Also when I got my Buffalo Burger and added the condiments their was a rotten tomato in the salad bar. Also chicken nachos had no cheese. Terrible service, managers and employees need to be trained properly because they have terrible customer service skills."}
{"text":"****health hazard**** cooking without gloves, sous chef picked his nose & then continued to handle food. no hair net worn either. salad bar was not clean and contents did not look washed or fresh. lucky we saw all this and canceled our order. utterly disgusting. people could become very ill from eating at this place."}
{"text":"My first and last visit to Fudds . The food was average but the real turn off was the fact that it was hotter inside than it was outside. Please pay your electric bill."}
{"text":"Great environment,great burgers and always fun to go to. I've been going here for years and it's definitely a place that will come to mind when I'm in the mood for a burger!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most overrated burger places. This place is expensive and the burger is not even that good. I had the Works 1/2 lb with drink and onion rings and it was $14.96. Can someone please call the cops, I jus got robbed. 

The burger was bland and small for 1/2 lb. the onion rings were few, I think I counted 8. The bun was way too big for the burger.i did not enjoy it at all. 

Spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Fuddruckers but the Orleans Food Court falls short of the usual restaurant experience. It's good late-night or in a pinch, but otherwise it's worth the trip over to the Grand Canyon location near 215/Flamingo."}
{"text":"Been a fan of Fuddruckers since I was a kid. Was thrilled when Vegas got it's first location. Went opening day, and have returned dozens of times since. Consistently delicious."}
{"text":"I go here about once a month for lunch and can say that I've never had anything but good service and great food. Those new Coke machines are slick."}
{"text":"Typically I enjoy coming in for a burger with my family. Today was a bit different due to my husband ordering a buffalo chicken sandwich. It came out a bit rubbery and after 3 bites, he just couldn't eat anymore. I walked up to the manager and apologized for asking for a new meal but he just couldn't eat the rest. With hesitation she said, yeah I guess. When we went to pick up the replacement burger, she pushed it toward my husband and turned around to walk away. No sorry, no enjoy your burger, nothing! She made us feel like we did something wrong. Argh! What a negative customer experience."}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped in for an early lunch.  There were about 5 customers.  As we walked in, there wad a couple placing their order.  As soon as they finished, we stepped forward to order.  The girl who had been taking orders said she would be right with us and proceeded to walk about 4 feet and started slicing avocados.  Then she proceeds to stop what she was doing and decided to have a conversation with another co-worker.  Another employee walked over to where we were standing and decided that was her cue to lean on the counter and draw hearts on a piece of paper.  I asked if she could please take our order but was completely ignored.  We decided at that point we would go somewhere else.  We have been regular customers at this location since moving to AZ last year.  Horrible customer service.  Never again."}
{"text":"Had the Santa Fe Turkey burger today and its awesome. You'll see me at Fuddruckers regularly it they keep this on the menu."}
{"text":"The pros:  The burger I got tasted great.  I haven't had a burger that tasty in a long time.  The bun was fresh and awesome.  the fries were soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside which I like.  

Cons:  Slow service.  And the price was a bit high for a burger, fries and a drink.  About $12.50 and I didn't get anything fancy on the burger.

But I would go back for the flavor.  All in all I was pleased with my experience."}
{"text":"As a restaurant that specializes in a certain food item (burgers) I am surprised that they have not come up with something more creative for vegetarians.  Given, it IS a burger joint, I get that, but in today's world, vegetarianism isn't so uncommon and many other restaurants have found ways to prepare vegetarian food that has flavor.  Why can't Fuddrucker's?

I visited this location with my family a couple of days ago.  I asked about the veggie burger and an employee said, \"I'm not going to lie.  It's a frozen patty and is flavorless.\"  Since I had no other option, I ordered it anyway knowing that I wouldn't enjoy it.  

I was more than perturbed to discover that my burger did not even include cheese.  Seriously?  Why do people assume that vegetarians do not enjoy flavor?  At an added cost, I opted to have my frozen patty topped with Swiss cheese.  Why did I have to pay extra for this?  Certainly it is costing Fuddrucker's less money to serve a meatless burger...  

After building my burger at the salad bar, it was okay, I guess but certainly not worth the price.  The staff was nice, but in order to return, I also need my food to be worth what I pay.  

Sorry, Fuddrucker's.  On the bright side, my husband claims he enjoyed his non-vegetarian burger."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers!!!! Went to eat here with my boyfriend and felt like we were the only Hispanics here hahaha. It was nice trying something different since we don't have many fuddruckers around us."}
{"text":"Decent build a burger ...had the burger with pepper jack everything was good but would be better if they seasoned the meat"}
{"text":"Placed an online order, I was charged twice, but 2 different amounts! Tried calling, let it ring for an\"associate\" the whole 10 mins to the restaurant. Got there about 7:15, food was to be ready at 7:11. I told the \"manager\" my name, she said Dave? My name is Sharon. I tried to tell her about double charge, but she walked off. Nothing makes me angrier! She came back and kind of tossed the food on the counter. Told her about double charge, she said she couldn't do anything about it, just trust me home office will refund it in a few days!. Wanted to make sure order was at least right, \"manager\" grabbeditout of bag and said, see it's right, I guess I have to get you a couple of drink cups. Then threw food containers back in bag, completely spilling one out into the bag! I was just in shock!. My steak sandwich was way overcooked, it was supposed to have bacon on it, and the onion rings looked like the were leftover from someone's dinner a week ago. So, I am out $29, + the amount for our dinners of $24, horrible  service, food horrible, and I am supposed to trust them, that I will get a refund. I am so extremely  upset and mad!"}
{"text":"Great burgers considering it's inside a food court next to Sbarro and Subway. Everything is made to order and costs just a tad more than your average fast food but tastes much better. 

My favorite is the 1/2 lb burger with sauteed mushrooms, onions and Swiss cheese. Best part is they ask how you want your burger cooked."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying I went to a different Fuddruckers about 5 years ago in Ohio and it was awful... but this one was AMAZING! The burger I got (1/2 pound beef mushroom swiss), and my boyfriend got the Buffalo burger with mushrooms, we also got a side of onion rings and we got it all to go. It was so tasty, flavorful and juicy. Seriously one of the best burgers I've had in a LONG time! The expeditor that was there that evening (Saturday night 10/20/12) I think his name was Eric, was so helpful, friendly and genuine. Thank's for the great service!"}
{"text":"Saw a roach on the floor near the trash can.   Would not eat here again.  Dirty and Disgusting.  You have lost me as a customer because you did not clean up your act.  Literally."}
{"text":"First place to treat gluten free like its not a bad thing. Manager gave my gluten free son a milkshake instead of a cookie. Freakin amazing he did that when he did not have to. This is now a spot to eat for a long period to come."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with a visit to Fuddruckers either the Black Canyon Highway or the Arrowhead Town Centre location. I usually order the 1/3 pound burger. This time I ordered the Bacon Swiss Chicken sandwich. It was remarkable, great flavor, fries were fantastic. I had a diet root beer, since I am diabetic it was nice to see something other than diet coke or diet PEPSI."}
{"text":"I love Fuddruckers but this location is terrible! We ordered through UberEATS! I have gone to the location in Tempe many a times so I know how ordering works! When you order from Fudds normally you choose your burger with the works of what ever you like and then it ALWAYS comes with fries unless you prefer something else! So we order with our hearts content, waiting, waiting, and waiting! Finally the food arrives, and like a slap in the face NO FRIES!!!! I even asked for extra cheese sauce for fries, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSE TO DO WITH ALL THIS CHEESE NOW WITH NO FRIES!  So I call the location and the lady talks to me as if I don't know how ordering from fudds works! She said we would have to call UberEATS and have a new order just for fries WTH! Lady fries are suppose to come with our meals! Disappointed with the food, upset with the lack of service, and angry at the fact that she underestimated my knowledge of Fudds ordering service! LMAO! Have a better luck ordering from them guys, just beware!"}
{"text":"Would have been a 5 if the damn coke machine worked right. 
My lovely wife had to experiment to get the syrup and soda water combination correct."}
{"text":"It's a little crazy how excited I was when Vegas got its first Fuddruckers years ago. Call it childhood nostalgia. These days Fuddruckers is okay- the burgers are decent, the shakes are good, the service is meh. I love that you can get an assortment of different meats without going to a gourmet spot (or the Strip) but I don't love the attitudes I tend to see from the staff. Still, I come in every once in a while when I'm in the mood for a greasy burger that fast food just won't satisfy."}
{"text":"First time here , service is okay could be a little more professional doesn't make customer feel welcome & it seems like we're just a bother , burgers needed more flavor but food came out fast . Overall is an okay place wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"If you wanted to make your own burger, you'd have stayed home! 


When I was a chubby 10 year old the idea of fixing up my own burger was mind blowing. Such freedom for a little kid. My memory of Fuddruckers was a fantasy land of food: Kaiser roll clouds floating by patty mountains and pickle slices flying overhead. Wow, that memory was viciously beaten when I tried this spot again. 

I went during lunch on a weekday and it was busy, but not slammed. I ordered a burger and fries, very basic. I was intrigued by the Elk and Ostrich burgers on the menu, but decided to stay classic. About 20 minutes later my order still hadn't been called. FINALLY, about 30 minutes after I ordered my name was called and I picked up my food. 

So they have a stand where you can dress your burger the way you like, which should speed up the kitchen....it doesn't. They have exotic toppings like pickles, lettuce, and tomato. Whats that you're thinking, those aren't special ingredients? AGREED. 

The burger was ordered medium, and came out well done. I was pressed for time so I didn't return it. The meat was dry and tasteless, yet somehow I left feeling bitter. 

Don't waste your time with foodwreckers, the draw here is knowledge; once you come, you know you'll never be back."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Fuddruckers in a year or two...I was so disappointed! 

The good. 
Friendly staff. Clean fixings bar. Updated interior. Cool soda machine. 

The bad. 
The burger itself seemed colorless grey and super greasy GREASY!  It was like it was precooked, and sat around in a steam table or something...and the bun seemed a little stale...definitely not the fresh baked that I remembered.

The hotdog was barely warm served on a VERY STALE bun.

The pico from the fixings bar hat ZERO flavor...it was basically chopped tomatoes and a few little pieces if onion. NO CILANTRO, NO SALT AND PEPPER, BLAND!!!!

The arcade game (motorcycle one) ate everyone's money. The manager returned our money, but commented that it happens all the time. Awesome. Get it fixed then.

Won't be going back. Red Robin next time!"}
{"text":"Super good food and great portions. We have yet to dine in, however my daughter,my sister and I absolutely love the food. We always order through UberEATS. My kid is a burger snob and loves them from here."}
{"text":"Front desk person wasn't the best .she was kinda rude and was talk to her other coworker about what time she was getting off .other then that the busier and the food was great ."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious and service is always fast. Toppings bar is full and veggies appear fresh. Great place to eat"}
{"text":"Cooks mixed up our order. Asked for medium rare bison and well done deer, got well done bison and extremely rare deer. The middle was completely uncooked rare. And I LOVE extra rare, but not uncooked. UNCOOKED. BLEEDING. SOGGY. My fiancé did like his bison, though. So 2 stars for his sake.

The place didn't seem very clean. Almost like it was more of a venue for kids. This was about 6 months ago, so hopefully they've cleaned up a bit."}
{"text":"Slowly getting worse every time we come here. This time really stale buns and onion rings took a long time after burgers but we're bumped up to a large."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger restaurant. The boyfriend and I sometimes go once a week. We have tried every exotic meat they offer, including the new Kobe burgers, and they are all excellent. My favorite is the elk. Most of the time I try to stick with turkey burgers, which are still well seasoned and wonderful.

I do have a few complaints even though I'm giving the place five stars. I love it, but I hope they read the reviews and make an effort to improve the place! 

The place is crazy on weekends and usually is crawling with unruly children. I don't blame the restaurant so much as I blame lazy parents. It's not Disneyland and it's not a playground. Nothing is nearly so irritating while eating one's meal as getting kicked repeatedly and hearing constant screaming in the ear. We just stopped going on weekends.

The other problem with this particular Fudds is that they kind of suck at cooking meat to temperature. They wont undercook your meat, but our rather spendy buffalo and elk is consistently overcooked. Why bother asking my preferred temperature if you're going to overcook my meat? The main problem seems to be that the chefs never take into consideration meat resting time. We complained once and it improved briefly. Now, if I order before my partner, I order my meat more rare than I want it. Sometimes it's still well done."}
{"text":"there is nothing wrong with this place.  burger heaven/perfection."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here at Fuddruckers.   My boyfriend has a gluten allergy so there are few places we can eat.  Patty, the General Manager, was awesome.   She was patient with our ordering, gave us good info about food preparations & was reassuring about the food allergy procedures.  Our food was delicious, the prepare area for food was clean & we were stuffed when we left!"}
{"text":"If you havent tried this place your missing out! Go try it.. if you have kids go.on a tuesday they eat free. Love this place!! First time I had it I was in Missoula, Montana. Bomb diggitty!!!"}
{"text":"Great burger! Had the hangover burger... Simply glorious! The restaurant has a great interior. The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star rating is because the outside of the restaurant appearance sucks! I have worked right by this restaurant for almost 2 years and drive by it on my way in to work every single day...it just looks like a run down restaurant that is about to be shut down so I never had any interest. The ONLY reason I decided to try it was because my husband ate at a Phoenix location and said it was amazing. He said the outside of their restaurant is even worse... Something to look into because the food and service was awesome..."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise.  I generally try to stay away from fast food and from chain places, but late night circumstances dictated.   

I got the buffalo burger, rings, and diet coke.  They bake their own buns, apparently, and cook the burgers to order.  You have to dress it yourself, but they've good a good selection of stuff to dress it with and condiments.  I took it to go, and it was really good.   The rings were good, too.  They are thick with a nice light batter."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie and a picky one at that. if you want a rating based on taste, this place is a solid 4 (I gave it a 5 because I feel the rating is too low for dumb reasons. This place has quality burgers with great gourmet buns!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and it was delicious. I got the bacon cheddar burger medium and it was cooked to perfection. The onion rings and various sauces were also very good. The set-up is a little old fashion but the food is solid. Very nice cashier up front. One of the few chains worth my money."}
{"text":"This location is THE PLACE to take your kid's team for an end-of-season party.  They accommodate large parties, take reservations for large parties AND allow you to decorate your tables with your team theme!    Equally important:   they LEAVE YOU ALONE during the process--- so if you are a frantic \"gotta get it ready & it's gotta be perfect\" last-minute-crafty-maven like myself, THAT'S A GREAT THING.

They play fantastic-classic rock & roll, as in 50's & 60's & they have really, I MEAN REALLY cleaned the joint up.  New upholstery, fresh paint & all done WELL.  Top that with 'cooked to order' burgers that are CONSISTENTLY out of this world & you too will shout WINNER!"}
{"text":"They were out of Diet Dr. Pepper and one Coke was out.  The drink machine was in need of a good cleaning.  One of the ketchup dispensers was out as well.  They have good burgers!   Overall it wasn't bad.  The price is a bit high for self serve type of restaurant.  There was plenty of seating for our group and I like the location.   Cookies are good too."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch, and overall it was pretty enjoyable. To start, the prices are a little too high to be paying for lunch. I ended up getting a burger with no fries and a water to drink and still spent $8.50. That's too much for just a burger and nothing else at lunch time. My friend got a 1/3 lb burger with fries and a drink and was $11.50 or so. That's my only real knock on Fuddruckers. You have to sacrifice to get out of the door for under $10.

I really like that they give you the option to add your own regular toppings (premium toppings are extra - bacon, fried egg, etc). You can top it with as much lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles and sweet peppers as you want! They also give you a broad range of condiments, which includes BBQ sauce. I was very happy with this aspect of Fuddruckers. The food came out quickly and hot so that's another plus.

The burger was good overall, for a chain burger. It wasn't overly flavorful but I don't really expect that out of a chain. Adding the condiments and toppings was a must. All in all, it was a decent burger and I would recommend people try it. For me, it's a once a year kind of place for a burger."}
{"text":"My Garden veggie with mushrooms, blue cheese and all the fixings rocked my world! Just what I wanted, an all-out veggie burger.  They even have Coke Zero and delicious wedge fries with all kinds of dip (jalapeno cheese? YES!) And the chic at the counter (Adrienne) super-nice and helpful...she even came out to check back on our happiness levels."}
{"text":"I LOvE fuddruckers. Coming from so cal I was pleased to see them in Vegas. Everything as expected and consistent.  Staff very friendly, especially the lady who walks around, friendly but a little too chatty.  I just want to enjoy my company and eat.  Otherwise love it"}
{"text":"This is where we always go for family gatherings etc. because people can come and go as they need to, everyone can pay for themselves and the food is halfway decent.

That is except for tonight. They ran out of cheese, didn't have any one-third pound burgers or any lids for kids cups. I have a two-year-old so not having a lid for his cup is a real bummer.

Luckily, another party reserved the back area of the restaurant but never showed so we got to take over that entire area. That made up for the other shortcomings!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a burger and love the steak fries! Good place to take kids or family and don't forget the awesome milk shakes!

Only two stars as we were here Wednesday night and ordered the Kobe Bacon Cheddar Burger only to find out they were out of Cheddar Cheese! What how can you be a Burger joint and run out of Cheddar? Fuddruckers ORDER extra Cheddar next time!

I will be back as things happen, just hope they have Cheddar when I go."}
{"text":"It was okay. I wasn't really a fan of this place but my fiancé loved it, as well as my son."}
{"text":"If it's busy go to the McDonald's across the lot. Undercooked fries and 1/3 of my burger missing \"from cooking\"! Seriously...at least McDonalds is consistent. 

Never Again."}
{"text":"They have improved their food and service over the past year, so I felt it only right that I update their rating.  I may still prefer 5 Guys, but I no longer dread the wife asking to come here."}
{"text":"I'm just a Fuddruckers sucker.  I've been a fan since I lived in California and have visited locations in Nevada, Masschusetts and Arizona, fervently missing these succulent burgers during my exile in Seattle.  

Since I don't care for condiments, just vegetables, it's very important to me that the meat is well seasoned and flavored.  Fuddruckers is both and that runs consistent no matter which one I visit.  They get lauded for their selection of fresh toppings available at the bar and the simplicity of the ordering process.  All you have to tell them is which burger, how well to cook it and what type of bun you want.  

The warmth of the service varies from place to place but for restaurants where you order at a counter and pick up when called, it's kind of beside the point.  

Another bullet point that stands them out:   They offer ostrich, buffalo, elk, boar and other varieties of burgers depending on the location and season."}
{"text":"I'm not a big burger eater and I'm a picky eater to boot.  Forget the condiments, super secret sauces and pickles.  It's all about me, the burger, bread, and veggies.  This is probably why most of the praise-sung burgers in the meat-eating world are wasted on me.... but not here.  I cannot say exactly what it is.  Maybe it's the meat.  Maybe the secret is how they cook the patty.  Or the fact that I can pick my own ingredients.  I have no idea what, but these are *good* burgers.  

I could spend time picking on the service at this particular store, but let's face it.  I'm just glad (for the all too brief  time I was in the Valley of the Sun) that Fuddruckers appeared in my window of possible lunch grub.  I like the quirky retro ambience.  It's roomy and offers a nice cool repose from the heat.  I only got a chance to eat here about two times because Priest Ave was out of the way from work.  On the last trip, I found out about their exotic burger menu.  I was set on trying the ostrich and elk burgers.  Before I could enact my plan, the company I work for relocated me back to Seattle in spite of my protests that I had too much food to explore.  What happened to priorities?"}
{"text":"at one time this was the best burger spot around now with so many place they are just average there good  for what you get they are on the pricey side what still make them is there veggie bar you get to pill your burger with all you want and all kinds of sauce the fries are OK the service is fast food service prefer at the counter call your number get your food no tiping now you have more money for cookies over all a good place to come bring the kids"}
{"text":"Fuddruckers goes waaaaaaaay back in my line of duty. I grew up in Michigan and had this place as my brothers 5th grade graduation dinner. I'm 23 now, so you know it's been a while. When I found out they were building a Fuddruckers by me, I was beyond ecstatic. It was Fuddrucking awesome!

Anyway, I wanted to review this place after a recent visit with my mother and brother. We came on a Sunday and were not aware that the restaurant closed at 9 PM. We arrived at 8:30 and immediately asked if they were still cooking. You could clearly tell that they were cleaning up and prepping to go home. I used to work in a restaurant and when people would come in so close to closing, I would feel the extreme animosity towards whoever came in.  We said we could leave, but their manager kindly urged us to stay. We placed our orders and they got the food out to use really quick. We had a order of onion rings with a couple of the burgers we got, and they burned them. But not so quick on the hate wagon because they hooked us up with a fresh LARGE order of onion rings on the house.

The food came out really quick and it didn't feel rushed or sloppy. There weren't employees walking around waiting for us to leave, but we wanted to eat as fast as we could because they were so nice to us. Like 15 minutes before closing people came in and you didn't see anyone look upset, they all happily served each customer and cleaned up what they could. 

I appreciated the great service and felt respected as a customer. I didn't feel once as if I was imposing while they were so close to closing up shop. The food here is always great and it's never a disappointment, especially when you are hungry. I would take anyone here as, it does not disappoint. CHEERS!"}
{"text":"Good God, I love this place! The burgers are delicious here! The staff are friendly, the restaurant is always clean and the food is ready very quickly. I always order the Hangover burger with the fried egg on it. So good. I highly recommend Fuddruckers as a go-to burger joint."}
{"text":"I'm so addicted to this place. The chili cheese fries are prob the best I have ever had. You must order them. The meat has always tasted delicious. I ordered the onion rings once, but won't order them again (nothing special at all). I will be back! I think I went 3 times in one week after trying it the first time. SUPER YUMMY! GO! It beats all the other burger places around hands down!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here Saturday.  I had the chicken sandwich special with the avocado and it was really good.  Lots of fresh avo, yummy soft bun and a perfectly cooked, juicy chicken breast.  Choose onion rings over fries and they were delicious.  Black Current ice tea was just right!  Deserts are really good too and you can't beat the price.  If you're too full take some to go!   They got really busy shortly after we arrived with sports teams in town for tournaments.  It got pretty noisy since people are up and down getting drinks and condiments.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst expiriance the busser  wouldn't let me touch the butt 
And kept talking about deep  frying ducks"}
{"text":"Ok, nothing spectacular.  The location is clean and the staff is super friendly, but I really didn't find anything great about their burgers.  The meat was a little dry and the bacon was pretty skimpy.  Both mayonnaise dispensers were low or out of mayo.  The bun is probably the best part of the burger.  I wouldn't say to avoid this location, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"I'm downgrading my review because they refuse to make hamburgers rare. They say they will cook them medium rare, but they're all pretty much medium (no pink). The meat tastes good, but not quite as good as Red Robin's Angus beef. I still love Fudd's homemade burger buns, seasoned french fries and kickass condiments bar, which collectively still make for a great eating experience but the burgers themselves could be better."}
{"text":"I ordered the Buffalo burger, medium with provolone, mushrooms and avocado. My wife and daughter ordered regular cheeseburgers, we had 2 fries, an order of onion rings, and 3 drinks....our bill was over 50$!!  I could actually see this if it were a sit down restaurant and we were being waited on, however for a cafe style facility this just does not make sense.  I realize my burger was a little more being buffalo however being charged the way we were for our sides is just ridiculous.  I have had burgers just as tasteful for a third of the price elsewhere.  Needless to say we will not be back I would rather spend our earnings a bit more frugally, it is just a burger.  For these prices stay home and grill for a couple WEEKS with your family of 3!"}
{"text":"A great burger place. It could use some more consistency with the temperature and size of the fries though. I am not a fan of the new coke machines because they get really crowded when the place is busy."}
{"text":"In 'n Out is so much better and cheaper! The burger is tasteless (even with a ton of add-ons like guacamole and hot sauces or bbq sauces that they offer). The bun deflates after a few pinches. The caesar salad was DRENCHED in dressing...practically a soup of dressing."}
{"text":"Eating here right now.  It is very good. We haven't been in a long time. The atmosphere is really nice. It is very clean and decorated nicely. The employees are nice and friendly and welcomed everyone as they entered.  The food is very fresh.  The fries are yummy. The grilled chicken sandwich with bacon is delicious. Very nice lunch."}
{"text":"YUM! I had no idea what this place was until my friend brought me. Cooked to order delicious burger goodness then you can pick your own toppings at the toppings bar. Plus it is reasonably priced. Now I'm hungry again."}
{"text":"Why oh why did we come here? Oh yeah the elk and buffalo burgers.  I know elk is one of the leanest meats there is but not Sahara lean. Disappointed. The buffalo was not any better.  The sweet potato fries good."}
{"text":"Have to love Fuddruckers! If you have a big family like I do, the kids eat free days are a lifesaver! No need to special order your burger. Order your meat and cheese and do all the fixins yourself. Service is always amazing and they talk to my kids like regular people. There's a little arcade area and 25 cent toy machines for the kids. My kids love their limeade and feel like they're breaking the rules by drinking soda. Don't forget to grab your cookie or brownie for your kids on the way out! And get the loaded fries.. actually, get two orders because they're delicious!"}
{"text":"\"When was the last time you had Fuddrucker's?\"  I curiously asked a coworker of mine.
\"It's been a looooong time\" he proclaimed.
\"Good, keep it that way!\" I said with a mighty fervor. 

Listen, this place used to be somewhere you could get a decent burger, now it is a place that you can get a blandly flavored microwavable piece of gray meat with a Kraft single half melted on top.  Oh and the bun tasted like it was pulled from the food storage bin in my uncle's fall-out shelter in \"Sector 7\" near the Canadian border.  I wouldn't feed this burger to a starving Syrian refugee who is denouncing Allah and proclaiming me as his new prophet and savior, for fear that he would spit it out immediately and have his hooded friend take my head off.  

What happened to Fuddrucker's?  I guess I shouldn't expect too much from a company that is owned and ran by Luby's.  Has anyone under the age of 50 ever been to a Luby's?  Not unless you are kid who is temporarily in town visiting his grandparents and they force you to go to the early bird special at 3pm on Tuesday.  

\"Grandma, when's dinner?\" the young boy asks.
\"You already had it, now drink this warm glass of milk and go to bed.\" she said at 6pm on Tuesday evening.

But hey, maybe that's what Fuddruckers is going for.  I hear cafeteria grade food is all the rage now!  Well for me, I guess I'll stick to someplace with higher quality standards like McDonald's or Circle K.

I feel like if Fuddrucker's was a Mortal Kombat character it's fatality move would be serving up a cheeseburger, charging you $13, and then forcing you to eat it.  Followed by a booming voice from above that proclaims \"Flawless victory!!!!!\""}
{"text":"Very yummy food. The burger itself was not expensive. It was the 'make it a combo'for $4.49 that made lunch for just under $25. There is a. Coke machine so you can make unlimited different drink combos.
You order as soon as you walk in then find seating. They call you when your order is ready and you put on the toppings (condiments & traditional produce). 
Seating is tables and armless chairs. Good for scooters. There are several seating sections /'rooms' that help make it feel more intimate than a huge dining hall."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! One of my favorite burger places. Pretty simple menu. What size burger do you want 2/3 all the way up to 1 pound and how do you want it cooked. They have a few favorite selections that come with certain things on them but you can order it however you want then hit the topping bar and load it up. Haven't been brave enough to try the game meat burgers yet. One of these days though.

Fries and onion rings are great. They have two Coke Freestyle machines which are always great. Like to be able to mix my soda up.

Now these are $6, $7, $8 burgers so this isn't your cheap drive thru burger but it is so worth the price. May not be an everyday place but once in awhile it is a great treat.

For me it is close to work and great for lunch because you pay when you order then once you finish your food you can just leave or you can always get it to go.

People are nice and the burgers are awesome. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great food! Tim was a great cook! & great communication for service. The one cashier gentlemen could be a little bit nicer though. Great hours & great food"}
{"text":"It's still a good burger.....with good value.....and it didn't take five guys to make it.  Whatever you do....don't give them your real name.  Make them call out something foolish or frivolous.  I like the name, Alberto!"}
{"text":"Burger was good, lettuce didn't look fresh, it was later in the evening but that's not an excuse to me....the service at the register was blah and the restaurant was dirty... the girl that finally started cleaning had headphones on and grabbed stuff off our table without asking if we were finished...I think I'll stick to Five Guys, lower prices and better service"}
{"text":"This was not what I remembered Fuddrucker's was like.  I have to say that the food was good.  One of our friends had onion rings and they were cold.  Not just a little, cold to the touch.  They promptly replaced them.  Burgers were good, not great, just good.  It will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Buffalo Burgers are the best! Seems pricey but wow taste is incredible! Wedge fries done right..fluffy & crisp. I had the black bean side..spicy. Friendly staff, clean/ fun dine in experience. Perfect location off the highway. Spend a little more than your typical burger place & u won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fuddrucker's has great burgers and some exotics ones too.  I usually have a 1/2   pound burger and my wife 1/3 a 1/3 pound burger.  The buns are made in the restaurant so are always fresh. 
You build your own burgers and I like to add jalapeños and nacho cheese to mine.  In addition they have one of the Coke Machines that allows you to select almost any type of soda you can imagine.  My favorite is Fanta Zero Cherry."}
{"text":"I've always liked Fuddruckers.  The burgers are cooked to order and the toppings are fresh.  Shame it's in the Orleans and I live behind Nellis."}
{"text":"I am not one for chain restaurants but since most of my family is and I admit, on occassion I do feel oddly comforted by them when outrageous amounts of change occur in my life... this brings me to Fuddruckers.  I was very happy with my turkey burger, just took a bit longer than my stomach was willing to wait (my dad had been finished with his burger by the time I sat down with mine!) My parents enjoyed their plentiful milkshake- after a good-sized spill they still had plenty to share.  I am still disturbed by the weird, goopy cheese available at the condiment station- who pumps cheese? My mom. That's who. And she loves it.

I enjoyed the booths. The employees were friendly and the one who checked to see if my turkey burger was ready when I couldn't wait anymore- did so in a friendly, patient manner that didn't make me feel like an impatient jerk.

I would go here again."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite burger place and I am so happy that this 24 hour mini version in the Orleans is the real deal.  The service is great. The toppings bar is exactly the same as in a full size restaurant. My burger is always cooked just right. Oh and the prices are not inflated."}
{"text":"I went on Saturday with my wife. You gotta order the burger well done or else it comes out bloody and raw. Love the burgers, i do wish they had more stuff to add tho. Great for early grubb before bowling upstairs."}
{"text":"Only my second time to Fuddruckers's; first time at this location. 

First thing when you walk in is a large free standing menu with highlights of certain entrees from the larger menu. From there your attention is directed to where you order your food and the full menu on a large billboard. The large menu was easy to read, and each item listed what was included, price and calorie count. 

We were there on a Sunday around lunchtime and had little to no wait. We ordered after asking a few questions. The cashier was patient and knowledgeable. We were given a buzzer to indicate when our food was ready.

There were two dining areas and a large patio. There was a condiment station that looked like a small salad bar, two of the new computerized coke machines along with a bakery area. We were headed out to the patio when we noticed two homeless men with shopping carts. Okay, back inside....found a table inside instead.

I ordered the blackened tilapia with a lettuce wrap. My friend ordered a bacon burger. Our food came up fairly quick. The tilapia looked amazing! Two filets on lettuce topped with blue cheese, and sauteed onions and mushrooms. I added tomatoes, pico and jalapenos from the condiment bar. (see pic) They also had onions, peppercinis, lettuce, mustard, mayo and ketchup available. Everything was delicious! Tilapia was flakey and moist! Burger was good. Only criticism was the amount of oil used to sautee fish and veggies. By the time I was about finished, the last of the lettuce was swimming in oil.

So back to the homeless men on the patio. This is a problem that needs to be addressed. It was quite apparent they were there and had been before. At one point, one of them came in with a to go cup from somewhere, looked around and headed over to the drink station. I didn't talk to anyone about it that day, but will call to let them know.

Overall, four stars. Will update after I call about the situation. Homeless on the patio and using the soda machines is a deal breaker for me, but will wait to factor that into my rating."}
{"text":"The service is always friendly, however they are hit and miss with actually producing the food as ordered. We have some unique food challenges and it is frustrating when we are specific in ordering and the food comes out not as we have ordered it."}
{"text":"We had to run some errands on this side of town and it was decided we would visit Fuddruckers for lunch.

Many different specialty burgers to choose from, we even saw elk on the menu.  I went with The Works containing bacon and mushrooms.  My girl had a tasty burger with green chiles on it.  Get the half fries and half delicious onion rings.

This location has a lot of walls and is compartmentalized.  No worries, they will call out your order on a loud speaker.

When the burger arrives.  You can take it over to the condiment station and add melted cheese, mayo, mustard, ketchup and an assortment of fresh veggies.

All was well and I would return again.  But not often the price for lunch for three people was a real kick in the pants."}
{"text":"Usually the food is great and the cream soda is awesome, but this visit the food was ok at best and the cream soda was out as was allot of other sodas. Also the floor staff was a little rude. I am very unsatisfied with the food, drink and the service."}
{"text":"Great burgers, awesome chicken sandwiches, ginormous hotdogs, yummy shakes, and tasty condiments. The prices aren't too bad, for as much food as you get. We've been to this location plenty of times and never had any issues."}
{"text":"OK first off yes they are a little pricey, however I totally believe that this place is totally worth the money.. With that said here we go, let's start with selection. If you like exotic meat this is the place for you, they have elk, buffalo, and wild boar! I have tried all except the wild boar, I may be gun shy? The elk and buffalo are great, Of course if you just want to stick to the basic the hamburgers are made anyway you like it. I love the works or the three cheese option. The best thing is that if you cant decide on fries or onion rings tell them you want the half and half. The topping are always fresh and ready for you to pile on your burger, this is why I love it here! The fact that they are 24/7 is awesome, the subway at the end of the food court better watch out, Fuddruckers is here to stay!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of their food. It wasn't amazing or anything that stood out. I like that you pretty much customize your burger but it definitely isn't one of the best burgers I've had.
I am however very impressed with the customer service I received. I don't remember the two names of the ladies who helped me but they were awesome. One was an African American cashier and she really helped describe the menu and popular items to us. When I received my onion rings there was a hair on top of the order and I instantly pulled it off so the cashier and another lady could see that it was there before I grabbed it. The Caucasian lady seemed like maybe a manager or something and she was extremely rude and made some comments about how she would have no idea where that hair would come from since \"no one cooking has that color hair\" ... Ok honey but clearly you see me pulling this strand off my freshly made food.
Another African American worker who was a cook actually came to our table later and was asking what she could improve on. I thought that was really admirable and awesome because I've never been anywhere that does that. She went out of her way to help us with things and ask where she could be better and even asked if we would like our food remade. Super impressed with both of those ladies customer service skills and felt really good after leaving."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to grab a burger and fries.  Certainly, there are several better burger joints around, but it's fine.  Only complaint was when I went to pick up our orders, the plates were extremely hot.  No warning from staff, and no trays around to carry the plates to the table.  So I had to just stand there and wait a minute or two for them to cool down."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger 1/3 combo medium well, for some reason the hamburger meat looked lite green and they gave me a very small portion of fries with my order. The Bacon Cheeseburger tasted foreign not very good, the bacon were just two very thin slices, this had to be the worst burger I had all year. Don't recommend anyone eat here, I eaten at other Fuddrucker and they were excellent.  Please avoid the Fuddruckers in the Las Vegas Orleans Casino at all costs!"}
{"text":"My first time coming here, it was not what I expected. You walk in and to your right is where you order. I thought it was a sit down restaurant and they take your order. The cashier was not helpful and didn't seem happy at all. Anyways I ordered a mushroom and swiss burger it was a bit too greasy. The buns were soggy. You can add vegetables yourself kinda like a DIY burger. The fries were okay. I did like the cheese sauce. I think I'm
better off going to Red Robin's.

Note: if you do get cheese sauce, get it when your food arrives or else you'll be waiting for your order while it gets cold. Had to make a second round for cheese sauce."}
{"text":"This is a bizzare blend between a fast food burger joint and a sit down restaurant. Service was strained - I ordered the Rajun Cajun and the server got confused on the entry and was trying to modify a burger into the Cajun sandwich. We finally got it worked out.

After you place your order you get your drinks and then sit down and wait to be called. I've always found this to be a bit annoying as half of the patrons hover around the delivery station anyway.

Overall the food was ok - just ok. I'd probably give them another try but my expectations will be more modest next time."}
{"text":"Bison burgers! Fantastic!

The burger I had here was very very good, and I especially like that you can put your own toppings on. No more making sure they know what I mean by \"double pickles, double onions, etc. etc.\"; just walk over to the toppings bar and load it up.

They also have pepperoncinis (aka banana peppers), which if you haven't tried them on burgers yet add a really great flavor you're missing out on.

The fries are thick cut and cooked very well, nice and crispy on the outside with a soft steamy inside.

The staff kind of acts like they don't want to be there. Which doesn't surprise me, given they all appear to be high school age kids and when I was that age I didn't want to be at work either. No big deal, they got my order right and the register girl was definitely good with customer service."}
{"text":"I like how you can pick what you want on your burger.  Good service, good food.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with Robyn N. and Rand H. for a fast food burger it was ok but I like a home burger much better. Even most bar burgers have more flavor.The french fries are good fresh cut fries and the toppings are added by you. If the fries had been not fresh and the topping bar weak which it was not I would have given them two stars."}
{"text":"Delicious food in a laid back atmosphere. The high stars though are mostly for Lasheika. (I think I spelled her name right.) Tonight was the second time I had the pleasure of being there while she was bussing. She has a great mixture of help and personality that make it a joy to dine there. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Better tasting burgers than your normal fast food burger restaurant. They have a topping bar where you can add as much or as little lettuce, tomatoes, onions, condiments, etc. as you would like."}
{"text":"Ate outside in the 70* partly cloudy patio area because indoors felt like it was 58* brrr 

Taco beef salad good as usual.
Burger a little under cooked for medium rare but tasted good,
Chili cheese fries were good portion but the fries were a bit over cooked almost mushy. 
Pumpkin pie shake...awesome! Like real pumpkin pie!"}
{"text":"Was here for Father's Day with my dad and family and was not impressed -- the food was good, but the service was sub-par. There was only one individual taking orders when the line was out the door and there was nobody bussing tables. 

I've been here before and it was good, but I am not happy with this visit."}
{"text":"My elk burger was amazing  - freshly baked bread and healthy meats inside with fresh veggies around. Testes just great! The price is almost trice than a regular burger - an elk one plus sweet potato fries is about $30. To me, this is an excellent combination.
 But the price is fully worthy.  Why then not 5 stars but 4. The service was pretty clumsy. I needed to wait 6 minutes for an order, that usually takes 2 - 3.
 Last time they didn't announce my name, so I needed to wait much longer. Space here is crowded and tight with few people almost always waiting for an order. The condiment bar is clean and well stocked.  Well, I just love that the place is open 24/7 but the Cheddar Cheese condiment isn't."}
{"text":"What better way to have a burger than to have someone just give you the meat and bun, and let you have at it with the condiment bar. If you ask for medium rare, you're gonna get medium rare, but other than that you can't rate too much on the service since you're pretty much serving yourself. The outdoor furniture could definitely use an upgrade, and they should offer public trash bins. I don't ever see any unless I'm just blind, or maybe they purposely just want you to leave your trash on the tables for some reason?"}
{"text":"Grew up with this chain in Texas, where apparently they have higher standards for both quality of product and service. 

Popped in to grab a burger for takeout when my guy had a craving. Signage was advertising their new bourbon burger with caramelized onions, bleu cheese crumbles, bacon, and sweet bourbon sauce. 
Opted for the 1/2 pound version ($8) and asked for a side of fries. 
Receipt reflects that I was charged $13: apparently I was upgraded to a combo, despite not receiving a drink. Apparently a \"regular\" order of wedge fries consists of 12 pieces. For FOUR FUCKING FIFTY. ($4.49- close enough).
I somehow did not realize this while I waited 20 minutes for my order.

Was asked how I wanted my burger cooked, stated medium. Burger received was well done. Despite all the toppings listed in the ad, only the onions and bourbon sauce appeared to be present in flavor, and very scant amounts of each because it still came off as dry. Did not taste any cheese whatsoever. Fries were tasty, topped with the jalapeno cheese sauce from their condiment bar that I love so much-- just wish I didn't pay $4.49 for twelve fries.

Oh, and that part about service and a 20 minute wait for takeout?
I placed my order with one guy just as a large group walked in, creating a line that literally went out the door. No one ever stepped on to the other register. Person ON register easily took five minutes to take each order- wonder how many of theirs, like mine, were taken incorrectly and overcharged."}
{"text":"This place is the biggest rip off. The menu is a lie. It says the burgers come with certain things but they don't. It's bread and patty and you have to pay for every thing on it including sauce. 

It's $5 to make an $8 chicken sandwich a combo. 

It's a food court burger place. Who do you think you are?"}
{"text":"Completely remodeled! So bright and open! Love it! The burger was great as usual. The condiment bar was clean with lots of fresh veggies and peppers and other fun things to top your burger. The new soda machines are so much better than the dirty fountain ones they used to have with the yucky drains. The fries are the best part. They have an amazing seasoning on them that I just can't seem to get enough of. The price... Under $10! for a burger/fries/and drink!!!! Just can't beat that. 

I had strayed from Fudd's for a while and now I will return all the time. What a drastic improvement. I am going back for nachos soon. They really have the best nachos, despite being an appetizer, they are  whole meal they are so huge and have so much yummy goodness on them! I also love the buffalo chicken sandwich. It is a little more money than the burgers but worth it and you can pick either fried chicken or grilled. 

Ok, enough ranting about how amazing this location is now with the remodel. But really, it does not look like the same place!!!!"}
{"text":"visited about 4 times now. Brought my hubby, then kiddo, then sister, and hubby again.
Never been for recently added breakfast, and never had anything other than a beef hamburger...
but dammit they are good.
I really love the ability to put your own amount of toppings on. Pile on as much condiments at the condiment station, fresh veggies at the veggie bar, and make your own damn soda!!!
I love that about a place.
So my favorite thing is the jalapeno nacho sauce to dip burger and my fries in. Hubby likes the heinz sauce...one time I even made a lettuce wrap for my burger...because you can!!!!! you can do low carb!!!! 
Love this friggen place.
They have a coloring contest for kiddos."}
{"text":"The last of a dying breed. A sit-down non-fast food hamburger restaurant. The make your burgers to order with a salad bar full of all the fixings. Decent prices and excellent tasting burgers."}
{"text":"Gotta admit that I've been going here since I was a child. That slogan \"The World's Greatest Hamburger\" doesn't do it justice. It's just a great, tasty burger! And don't get me started on the fries. Thick wedge, nicely seasoned and my favorite add-on is shredded cheese. Once it's melted it's absolutely delicious! I highly recommend this place to any burger enthusiast."}
{"text":"Service was good and not too long of a wait. Went during a weekday at lunch time.  These burgers never disappoint! I usually get the buffalo burger medium well and it's always cooked perfectly. The condiment bar lets me get how ever many pickles I want and the fries with the jalapeño cheese sauce is always delicious"}
{"text":"I am giving Fudds 1 star but only for just being open.  We came in tonight to give this restaurant a try.  I had a coupon from GWS and it was BOGO.  I like to find restaurants near my business that I can take my staff to for lunch occasionally so we thought we'd check it out.  When we first arrived at the revolving door the first thing I noticed was the dirty glass.  Gross.  The place was not very busy for a Friday night around 6:30.  We went to the counter, looked at the menu and presented our coupon to I think it might have been the manager and right away he said -- just to let you know this coupon is for the burger only - no toppings.  Well ok.  This was not clear on the coupon we just saw it as an opportunity to try a new place.  Obviously this manager took it as an opportunity to drive people away.  So we walked.  Really?  We won't be back ...ever.  This restaurant won't be open for long.  Good luck.  BTW we went down the street to our regular spot for Friday night which is Sprechers and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"This has always been my go to place for fish & chips but lately the quality of the fish has gone way down instead of flaky fish it is tough & chewy & the chips are soggy.The last time I went there(3/1/16) I had to chase a roach off my table.I informed the mgr.on duty and she told me it's an ongoing problem.Has she never heard of bug control companies in the area.Not a good enough response to make me want to go back."}
{"text":"OMG, If you want a GREAT BURGER there is nothing in comparison...I'm sorry but I have been to so many places to try something different and I am always let down because I expect it to be better than Fudruckers and it never is...Awesome fresh baked  buns and cheese sauce for the fries...Its a must try..get the burgers medium to medium-well, Never well done....LATE"}
{"text":"Got in the email a buy one get one free for Thursday (today), clicked on it to get coupon, and said expired, was only good for Wed. Someone needs a new advertising agent!"}
{"text":"Fuddruckers was always my childhood favorite burger shop. Place always had the Route 66 memorabilia and statues of the blues brothers. Decided on a whim to try it since its been years. Most of the memorabilia has been removed these days. No blues brothers statues and from what I understand most of these location have closed down.

Their burgers and frys are some of my favorite. Fresh meat and they make their own buns. Fix the burgers any way you want and they won't care. The steak frys have a delicious seasoning which is why these have been a favorite of mine off years. I also had an Oreo shake that came out old fashion style with the glass and the metal mixing tin. 

Food was great but just miss all the decor that was missing."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and never have I had worse service! Food was cold like it was old and had been sitting out, cashier Brittany was rude and not helpful at all with getting the issue resolved. Management was sarcastic when confronted on he issues and proceeded to be passive aggressive when my order was brought back out. Very displeased and has changed my view on the place."}
{"text":"Never saw this on Grubhub before but tried to order delivery.  $20 is steep for lunch but sometimes I just crave a good burger and wedges with cheese.  Working from home I can't always get out for food or have time to make it so I take a guilty pleasure.  To my surprise the order (with instructions no cheese sauce no go-as it's not an option on the delivery menu that I could find) and they nailed it.  Separated the cold from the warm.  Just have to pop it into an oven for a few minutes to crisp the wedges and all perfect!  4/5 for soggy food but I can improvise.  Need a new crispy delivery box for any inventors out there!"}
{"text":"Upscale fast food with interesting options like elk snd buffalo. They have a soda machine which has a huge variety in it and very friendly staff. Their portions are so huge and burgers so thick that I was full after a half a burger. The onion rings were the thick cut style. You can get jalapeño cheese and regular cheese sauce and dress your own burger with a mini salad bar. I only give it 4stars because they asked how I wanted my burger. I said medium, and it was well done. Otherwise, food tastes and looks homemade."}
{"text":"Difficult to write a review of this place because the customer is actually responsible for the toppings and appearance of their food, so am I commenting on my own work or theirs?

First visit in late April 2014 5pm easter sunday. The place was about 1/5 full. Took about 8 minutes from order to service. You place your order at the front register and pay. They hand you a cup, straw and an electronic flashing light pager. You get your drink and find a seat on your own.

when your sandwich is ready the pager goes off, you walk back up to near the register and collect the plastic basket with your food. Next comes two small bars with condiments: peppers, onions, pickles, Pico, relishes, lettuces, tomatoes, ketchup, mustards, mayo. Paper towels on rolls at the tables. 

My total bill for 1/3 lb burger with a drink was about $7.50. The glass stays in the restaurant. They clean off the tables. I left no tip since there is no table service and everything else was self service.

The burger was cooked correctly to order (medium), it was juicy and had an actual beef flavor despite my toppings. 

As far as the basic burger goes, it's about identical to Red Robbin or Five Guys. Slightly faster than Red Robbin and slightly cheaper. There is a choice of burger patty sizes, so the Fudd's burgers are mostly larger than the others but you get to choose.

On the fudd's website, the name: \"legendary Build Your Own® market fresh produce bar\" is a huge exaggeration. It's small and looked picked-over, some of the pumps were empty, and elderly folks in line can mean you'll be waiting minutes to complete your sandwich. 

The menu board is confusing. All it's really trying to do is upsell you extras to up the price. You don't need to look at the menu at all, just know what size patty you want, how you want it cooked, drink or not, fries or not, and that's it. I go in and say: \" I want a one third pound patty, cooked medium, no cheese, small drink, dine-in please.\" If you're a normal burger purist, all of everything else you may want is on the condiments bars.

Despite the negative findings I think it's a good value and a well above average burger.

Summary: very good burger, average steak fries, mediocre service, slightly pricey, good location, stupid name, not fast.

Update: Been back here about six times. The register lady is sometimes way over the top fake friendly but otherwise the burgers are still good."}
{"text":"It's been a long long time since I've frequented a Fuddruckers.  Had the chance to stop by this one for a family gathering.  This place can accommodate a lot of people and large parties fairly well.

The food was good.  My burger was cooked as requested and the fries were fresh.  The condiment bar was rather stale.  The tomatoes were on the old side as were the jalapeños and sliced onions.  A simple suggestion would be instead of putting a huge trough of them up there the workers should cut them on the hour and put out a reasonable amount of fresher cut ones.

The place was pretty filthy.  There were cups, straws, and trash thrown on the floors.  There were also piles of food left on tables throughout the restaurant.  At first I thought there were a bunch of sloppy customers but when I left I realized there are no garbage cans around to clear your food when you are done.  They should install some trash cans or hire a couple more employees to bus tables.

The price is a little high for the fare.  Not totally out of bounds but enough that you could understand they are losing lots of business to the other higher end burger chains popping up left and right.

We all know what to expect from Fuddruckers by now.  Decent burger that you can customize and all the hot nacho cheese you can eat.  It's not the cheapest or cleanest place in town but the burgers are still tasty."}
{"text":"Best hamburgers .. Love t jalapeño cheese for fries."}
{"text":"Been here many times , although something has happened with yelps check in counters. I love this place, they have exotic meats, and a bar to dress your burger up.Will be back..."}
{"text":"They make their own bread!! Nothing is pre packaged, everything here is fresh.  You can choose your meat size!  I recommend this place to anyone who is a burger lover!! I can no longer go to a drive through for a burger"}
{"text":"Four stars for their tilapia sandwich.  I was a little worried about ordering this since they are really known for the burgers, but I just didn't feel like a burger.  Fish was moist and flavorful.  Got sweet potato fries also.  Fries were very good."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place for burgers.  Went there last week and was completely disappointed.
Food, Service, and even the soda machine was significantly degraded from my last visit. There were only 2 of us, but they managed to get 50% of the order completely wrong, even though the receipt had it right.
They forgot my wife's topping request and both burgers were undercooked.  They don't provide relish any more (I thought that was a burger staple)!  There was no malt vinegar for the fries.  Our order was for unseasoned fries and they got that wrong.  There were 2 soda dispensers and neither one worked properly.  They sputtered stuff out and the syrup was missing.  Most of the toppings on the salad bar were missing or really messed up.  They used to provide whole pickles but not any more.  The tomatoes did not look like they were edible, and even the ketchup dispenser was empty. Very disappointing meal!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Fuddruckers and I wasn't impressed. I ordered the BBQ burger through Uber delivery. It was just okay. Nothing to write home about. The burger patty itself tasted bland without all of the ingredients like the sautéed onions. It tasted like the chef hadn't seasoned the meat. The steak fries were really good though. Needless to say that's probably the only thing I'll order in the future if I ever do order again. Overall subpar."}
{"text":"I used to eat all the time at Fudruckers in Texas and loved it so I was beyond pleased to see one here right down the street from my mom's house and it did not disappoint.  The burgers are just delicious.  Unlike 5 Guys they're thick and they'll cook them to order.  The buns are cooked on site and are so good. The topping bar at this location is very well maintained and the overall service was excellent.  So for chain burger places 5 Guys is good but given a choice give me Fudruckers."}
{"text":"Just ate here today. Dug it!
Seems like they remodeled a while back. Looks a bit more open inside than before. I actually used to like it better before as far as the decor and atmosphere but it was no big deal. The burgers have always been very tasty and perfectly seasoned. For the 1/3 lb burger no cheese, fries and a drink about 8.50. Prices are fair, folks are friendly music not blaring to loud just a great place with fresh fixins' that you can add as much or as little to your burger or chicken sandwich. Two types of lettuce await you as well as fresh sliced tomatoes, two kinds of pickles,onions, jalapenos and more. Truly love this place and you can't beat the price for a burger. Burgers like they used to be. They have a nice crispy edge to them very moist and flavorful. Used to come here more often but while the economy was bad for the last several years we held from going out alot. Now that things are getting a little better and we have a little extra disposable income we are going to frequent this place a lot more often.  Must try their 1/2 burger some day soon.....Hum, maybe next weekend.  LOVIN IT!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are delicious! You're able to choose from an array of toppings from a toppings bar. They also offer various sauces including 2 types of cheese sauces, ranch, etc. I would be going back with my family and will be recommending Fuddruckers to others!!"}
{"text":"Fuddruckers- A-OK.

Decent burger. (I went with the swiss melt)
Decent onions rings.
Decent buffalo wings. (boneless)
Decent potato wedges. (bacon cheese)
Total: $30.00 (including a soft drink)

The burger was way too greasy for my likings. I used three napkins on my first bite. C'mon guys!! Lighten it up a little bit.  I did, however, LOVE the condiment bar. I felt a little uneasy at first....a little bit of my germaphobe came out, but everything looked fresh and clean.  The buffalo wings weren't as flavorful as I'd like. Onion rings were nummy. Potato wedges? Well, they weren't as good as they looked...

Boring review as nothing was AMAZING. and nothing was worth RANTING about.

Would I re-vist? Possibly. The different \"exotic\" meats looked intriguing. But I could just find a different place that offers them...

Keep on with yo' A-OK self Fuddruckers! According to some other reviews you're doing something right!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a great Bday dinner! My sole complaint is that they do not cook your burger as requested. If you are going to go to the trouble of asking how I'd like it cooked, please listen and COOK IT HOW I ORDERED IT. Out of three orders, all three were cooked wrong. Now don't get me wrong, the burger was still juicy and delicious. But I like my burger medium, and it was cooked totally through, no pink at ALL. It wasn't a big enough deal tome to warrant sending it back, because it was quite a drive from Scottsdale and I was hungry. But my friend decided to treat himself with a Kobe Burger and if you are going to pay more for premium meat, you expect to thoroughly enjoy it. Each one of us cut our big ass burgers in half, and once again, his Kobe was way overcooked. Ordered it medium and there was not a hint of pink. He was just going to suck it up and eat it, but we coaxed him into sending it back. At least they took care of him, because his replacement was up in about 3 minutes. This time, it was cooked properly. Props to the kitchen for expediting! Three tasty burgers was the end result. 
I had a BOGO coupon for my birthday, which is just a free burger with purchase of any entree. I ordered a single 1/3 lb burger with pepperjack cheese. To my delight, I got a DOUBLE due to an error! I also got free fries and a drink! SCORE! I was totally content with my free burger, and just share the boyfriend's fries... but no complaints! 
Don't forget the jalapeno cheese sauce for your fries! They also have those Coke freestyle machines and the condiment bar to dress your burger the way you like it.
Tasty meal, great service and I scored a free birthday meal. Keep up the good work, guys. Just maybe build one closer to Scottsdale/ PV!"}
{"text":"There is something exciting about picking out every option for your lunch/dinner. You select the patty and the toppings. The only thing you don't get to do is make it yourself.  The burger's are good and the atmosphere is fine. I think their appeal is also their downfall, when you can get a pretty good burger and some fast food joints (Five Guys,  In N Out) having to spend the time for Fuddrucker's seems a bit pointless."}
{"text":"Pretty underwhelming experience. The burgers were just ok. Cooked exactly to order which was nice. We ordered chicken tenders which were over cooked, nearly burned when we received them. The manager did refund that portion of the meal."}
{"text":"Great food , was a super windy day today but the restaurant was still bustling . Ordered just the basic burger and fries and boy was it delicious. Spent about 10$ which is reasonable for the quality of food and still got to take home some ."}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries and a drink!  We love coming here for the family, you get to pick your toppings, dressings and more.  The choices of burger meat and size give you variety.  Can't forget the desert counter and shakes! I've been coming to Fuddruckers ever since I was a little boy with my family and now we bring our boys.  I haven't tried it yet, however I have seen some amazing looking gourmet salads eaten by other patrons.  Thanks for so many great memories!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. The burgers are really good and fresh. I love how you can build your own burger. Fries are yummy too. The hot dog is the only thing that's alright, but it's big!....overall it's a great place to get a delicious, fresh burger and it's open 24 hrs!"}
{"text":"Always great food!! Love you can make your burger your way!! The cheeeezzzeeee! Malt vinegar for the fries is a little unknown secrete come and plan to leave with a FULL belly! My kids love the coke machines you can make hundreds of different drinks and never get tired of the same old thing... fresh baked cookies and shakes are always a must!"}
{"text":"The elk burger is leaner than a grilled chic sandwich and a lean sub for beef"}
{"text":"Not that impressed. Had a coupon so decided to check them out. They nickel and dime you at the register. They ask if you want regular Fries, sweet potato fries  or onion rings. They don't mention the added price. Just tack it onto the bill. Much better deal and Service at Red Robin."}
{"text":"Remember being a teenager and riding my ten speed to one of their restaurants in Houston. You could get the tasty Ribeye Steak Sandwich and it was right around $5. Boy those were the days.

This is one of the few remaining Fuddruckers here in town. Several other locations have closed their doors and transported themselves back to the land of Fudd. Really liked the PV location before if folded. Maybe there are just too many burger places around to keep those cows mooing.

Always order one of the 2/3# Burgers with nothing on it. You can spend the extra money for add ons if you want. Usually just go to the giant condiment area and go crazy with an all you can eat. The Nacho Cheese is sinfully delicious and it ends up like a swimming pool on my plate. Note to self ... May not be real cheese?

This is a fun place to take the kid's without going overboard. There is plenty of space for them to run around and some video games in the rear eating area. Service is average and the burgers are cooked according to your wishes.

You can even build yourself a giant salad using ingredients from the giant fixins area. Hard to believe but it's true. Wife and daughter do it all the time. Just make sure to order something so you get a plate.

Going to round up on this place due to the level of freshness and the endless Nacho Cheese sauce. BRONCO BILLY THUMBS UP!

3.75 STARS"}
{"text":"While doing some shopping around Arrowhead I felt a little nostalgic when my car ended up facing the Fuddruckers.  I worked at Fudd's as one of my first jobs in Calumet City, IL circa 1985...it was great, they used to give away all the buns that weren't used that day to the employees every night...ahhh....the memories.............
They aren't giving anything away these days-small burger with fries and a drink (FARKIN' YUCKY PEPSI B.S. PRODUCTS TO BOOT, as noted in previous lessons signs of a cheap-arse restaurant) was more than ten bucks!!  AND THAT WAS THE COMBO DEAL!!
The restaurant was empty as I probably went just as they opened at 11, so the friendly staff had no other patrons to tend so I was like a queen...The burger was as good as I remember though and so was the fresh bun.  Topped how I like, I wish they offered shoestring type fries though as I am not a fan of the wedges-they don't ever get crispy!!
My main beef (no pun intended) is with the prices, there's just not that sense of value especially these days.
T Out :)"}
{"text":"I used to go to Fuddruckers back in Texas in the 80's when they still had the butcher and you could even get bones to take home to the dog.  This place is always busy and the burger is good but the customer service is so awful it is not worth the aggravation of coming here when  you can get a good burger elsewhere.  They got my order wrong then basically argued with me when I wanted it corrected."}
{"text":"Fudd's is incredible, no matter where you go. The food is always consistently high quality and the service top notch. I was very pleased to see them finally enter the Las Vegas market, as our closest Fudd's was in the Los Angeles area. I don't go there as often as I would like because it's a bit pricey for a burger place, but it's great for a treat once in a while. The buns are light and tasty, and the flavor of the meat is unbelievable."}
{"text":"The burgers are Freaking awesome ..... Just don't order it to your room because we did 2 times and both times they got it wrong. :("}
{"text":"OMG, this place is terrible. XD

Honestly, I only went there because I saw the movie Idiocracy and I thought it would be hilarious.

And let me tell you, it was everything I dreamed it could be.

I was especially amused by the boasting about \"whole wheat buns\" when the buns were seriously the most processed thing I've eaten in a year.

I was really irritated that they wouldn't let me substitute a veggie burger in their stupid meal deal. Like, what the eff?

I wanted a shake, but for five bucks on top of the $8 for my burger and fries I was like screw that, and I didn't get a drink I just had water.

That being said, it was okay. I really would have liked a healthier bun, but I did like how you can build your own burger and pile on your own toppings.

I got a brownie at the end and it was pretty good but god knows what was in it.

I really wouldn't recommend eating here...unless you either really like junk food, or saw the movie Idiocracy and you get off on overhearing incredibly stupid conversations.

But if you want a burger and fries, and you don't mind spending $10...go to Red Robin! It's way better and it's right there."}
{"text":"Hot food, nice people, clean restaurant.  Burgers were cooked well.  Came with a large party (about 30) and they easily accommodated us.  Food was good quality."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Forgot how good they were. Awesome staff very friendly very attentive. Definitely will be back more often."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries and love the burger bar! Seemed a little pricey though. but it was delicious"}
{"text":"The food was great.  Quality ingredients.  The staff and service is great.  Nice and clean eatery."}
{"text":"1st time visit, took the family. Food was really good, prices were very reasonable and kids ate free. I had the original burger and wife had a 3 cheese. I would recommend this location, the customer service was a+ always suprising when a chain store has that small business feel. I will visit again."}
{"text":"It's good, delicious in fact, but you really have to pay for it. A burger itself is around $7, and to make it a meal adds an additional $4, so for a decent size burger and small portion of fries you're spending $13 with tax included. But like I said, it is really Good."}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5 stars.
I've been itching to visit this joint because I haven't had Fuddruckers since I lived in SoCal and I loved it there. I put off my visit because I read the many reviews that mentioned some cleanliness issues. While I'm glad to report that I didn't see any glaring cleanliness issues during my visit, I had some other issues.
But first, a brief description of this joint. You basically choose a size, choose toppings and add as much veggies and sauce as you want. Or you can choose from a preset menu. For sizes, you can choose from a 1/3 pound, 1/2 pound, or even 2/3 pound. You can even choose various animals whose meat you want to consume, such as Elk, Ostrich, Buffalo and some others. If you're more conservative, they also have chicken and hotdogs too.
So here is my first problem. I truly believe that the sizes are smaller than they used to be. When I was fat, I always ordered a 1/2 pound and even then I felt it was enough. The meat would be flush with the bun and I'd have to grab the burger carefully. I was hungry this time so I ordered a 1/2 pound and I felt it looked small . The meat could be completely hidden by the bun. After I finished, I felt barely satisfied. And keep in mind, I'm over 50 pounds lighter now, and I'm saying this. Since it looked small, I overloaded my burger with veggies. Maybe next time I'll try the 2/3 pound...something I never even thought about even when I was fat. Maybe I'm wrong. So if you are going for the first time, my suggestion is to just try the 1/3 pounder and go from there.
My next problem is that the staff definitely didn't look like they wanted to be there. Very cold and unfriendly. Not a fun vibe. Makes me not want to come back. 
In sum: food was still great, albeit small, but service was sub par, so 3-3.5 stars. I'll be back though because I have to try a 1/2 pound Elk Burger."}
{"text":"Back in the day, and I'm talking 1991/92, Fuddruckers was rad. They would receive whole sides of beef to grind for burgers, they baked everything in-house, made their own ice creams, had amazing table service, and had a relatively great soda jerk atmosphere. It was awesome. 

Now? It's kind of like the burger joint that time forgot. Sad people sitting multiple tables apart from one another whilst eating over-cooked meat on poorly-executed buns. Though the buns are baked fresh daily, they lack any sort of \"pop\" to showcase any deftness within the bakers' hands. Just sad and flavorless. 

The atmosphere seems to be more arcade-centric than food/service-centric. There are so many games on either side of the restaurant. It's pretty funny. 

I ordered the 1/2lb burger and asked for medium rare. What I received was a pretty fantastically well done patty of sadness. Even dressed with a few pickles and barbecue sauce, there was no seeing through the unfortunate event that happened in that kitchen. Bummer. 

Will I return? HA! No way. Fuddruckers used to be something wonderful. Now, it may just need to be put out to pasture. All puns intended."}
{"text":"It all started as a childhood memory of going with my dad at a very young age to his landscaping customers, and the day ending mid afternoon and going to lunch here. Perhaps as a child...burger, hot dog, chicken nuggets, and mac and cheese are the four main food groups and my expectations were ketchup and more ketchup on whatever it was. Took my girlfriend their after reminiscing old memories, talk about a bombshell.  Don't look up the ceiling is 30 years old and you know it....so gross. Ordered a classic burger. One word....terrible. For God's sake give the cook a salt and pepper shaker at a bare minimum. I'm not sure who said it was okay to flat top cook frozen meat --- no marinade no seasoning no mix in to the meat....just plain boring meat....and label it 'world's greatest'....they should be taken in the street and beaten.  Save your hard earned dolla dolla bills and go to Lenny's a few miles down the road where the won't serve you a basket of disappointment and a side of boring. So lame I couldn't bring myself to waste the effort on a pic."}
{"text":"Fuddruckers offers up a decent burger. It is on the pricey side, but the quality of the burger is good. I love the fresh fixin's bar. Their shakes aren't bad. I should have taken another look to see if they offer malts. I love their seasoned potato wedges.

Tip: It is better to dine in than to carry out. The styrofoam box continues to steam the potatoes, and sadly they lose their crispy goodness. 

The location is a little obscure, but my family and I were grateful for a place to get some grub in the corner of 19th Ave and Dunlap."}
{"text":"Service is good, the burgers are fresh, you can get any toppings you want, I do wish that they had a side that wasn't fried, like a small salad or veggies.  Great lunch place!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our recent trip to this location.  We ordered to go for our family of four.
The burgers were bland and had no flavor.  They were also very expensive!  After spending
Close to $10 a piece for burgers (with no cheese, $1.00 extra) I declined fries.  I wish I had spent my 40 bucks somewhere else.  I will never return here.  For $40, a family should receive a burger, fries, and a drink...and it should taste good!  Not here.  Don't bother!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with being greeted by smiling faces versus the automatic one liner most places teach their staff. As soon as I walked in, I was overwhelmed by the choices they had. The menu made it really hard to choose what I wanted to eat. Have you ever stood in front of a menu just looking and not reading? That's what happened :(

I went with the Elk burger with The Works (grilled mushrooms, American cheese, and bacon), wedge fries, and a drink for $15! I thought, 'ok. fine. it better be good!' Hey! I'm not cheap-- we're in an economic crisis! Haha! I get a buzzer to let me know my burger is ready (awesome so you don't have to wonder or miss hearing your name!) and when I get the burger, my high expectations aren't met. I guess I assumed the elk burger would have more of a game-y flavor but I was wrong. I probably should've went with a regular beef burger.

Definitely a very cool environment! The staff was very hospitable because we held a birthday parry there. They helped store the cake and was very accommodating. Kudos for the great staff but I was semi-disappointed with my choice. Happy birthday Ryanel!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a great burger based on the reviews, and also my coworkers who dine here regularly. This location is inside the Orleans casino, in the food court. They have a pretty large menu with different types of burgers, sandwiches, breakfast and sides. They also have exotic burgers, such as buffalo, elk and boar! I made a mental note to come back and try these. It was lunch time when I stopped in, so I decided to try the works burger as a recommendation from the cashier. The works burger is a 1/2 or 1/3 pound patty, cooked to your liking, with bacon, american cheese and mushrooms. I added fries (wedges) and a drink to make my meal a combo.

So side note, I love customization. Especially DIY customization. With that said, I was as happy as a kid on Christmas day when I saw Fuddruckers topping bar. The topping bar had your basic burger toppings; tomatoes, onions, pickles, relish, jalapenos, and some non-traditional items such as pico, and banana peppers. There was also ketchup, mustard, mayo, and liquid cheese. They do have ranch but it is $0.50 plus tax for a 4oz cup. I took full advantage of the bar and added lettuce, tomato, mayo, and pickles to my burger. I also got a side of liquid cheese to dip my fries into. 

The cashier gives you a pager while you wait for your order.  It was interesting to see it used in a fast-food, food court setting. After about 7 minutes, my pager went off. The burger was okay, the fries were meh and they give a small amount. The liquid cheese was warm, not hot and lumpy, which makes me think it had been sitting for a while without being changed. I paid close to $14 for a meal here, which imo is not worth the price.

Yelp 2015 Review #16"}
{"text":"When my kids were little this was THE PLACE to go. Food was great, everyone got what they liked and affordable! My kids grew up and the last time I was there the onion rings changed- not good. Went a few nights ago after a 3 year haitus- YUCK!  I got a fried chicken sand and it was AWFUL!! It tasted like it was fried in old oil. . Then there was no honey mustard which I have always loved!  I sampled my kids fries and they were cold and limp. I am sad that I will never again eat at Fudds, It was just so bad that I wonder why I would?
But I do like the new set up of not putting the drink station in the middle of the place. So long Fudds. It was great while it lasted"}
{"text":"I frequent this spot a lot b/c it's close to my work and a couple of the employees already know me by face and name! My favorite is the buffalo burger but I also love their other exotic meats, ostrich, elk, and wild boar. I still love their regular burgers too! They are probably my favorite burger in the Valley, not far from Johnny Rockets, another favorite! :)"}
{"text":"Located inside the Orleans casino, I was pleased to find it served food 24 hours a day, and delivered to your room, too!! But, the trek down to the food court from my room (which was basically the last room at the end of a long hallway) made me earn my food (hahahahaha... that is what I tell myself to make myself feel better about the deliciousness that I consumed).

What I found surprising, for being in Vegas and for being in a casino, the prices are actually comparable to my hometown's Fuddruckers. That's a plus. I didn't just spend twice as much on the same type of food.

I get the grilled chicken salad, and add the burger toppings into my salad to add more punch, like the pepperoncinis, jalapeños, and salsa. Very, very filling. I eat quite a bit, and even I can't finish the salad.

The waffles and chicken, perhaps because my bf was drunk, pretty much disappeared the second I made it back to the room. I turned my head for 2 minutes, and when I turned back, the food was gobbled up. He didn't even put the butter or syrup on them. Lol. The chicken is actually pretty moist. Some places, when they deep fry their chicken strips, it tends to be dried out. We've gotten the chicken with the waffles at 3a in the morning, and then again as an entree choice at 3p, and found them to be the same; crispy fried on the outside, but moist and tender on the inside.

Need a quick bite, they're perfect. Too drunk to leave your room, call in and have it delivered. Middle of the night cravings, whaaaa.... they're still open!! I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"Got the grilled chicken sandwich with onion rings and fries. The sandwich was ok; the bun was soft. The onion rings and fries tasted old. Not worth $13 for that combo!"}
{"text":"Went there Saturday 7/23 about 5pm.  It wasn't very busy and we haven't been there in years but we drove past it and decided to go.   We placed our order and I didn't pay attention to the receipt as I had the drink cups in my hand and stuffed it into my pocket.   When we got called to get our burgers the young lady at the counter informed me that she accidentally overcharged me and needed the receipt to correct the bill.  I appreciate very much the honesty and ethics.   Obviously  It was the right thing to do on their part but they could've gotten away with it.  I wonder how many people today in society would not have done the right thing....  Anyways Good job Fuddruckers.  By the way, the restaurant was clean, the fixin area was clean and well organized and everything was fresh and the burgers were yummy!"}
{"text":"This is our first visit to this location. The place is fairly clean and the menu is simple enough. I ordered samurai chicken sandwich. My husband had one of their specialty burger. The chicken sandwich is made of teriyaki chicken breast, pineapple and lots of onions. It's so juicy and tasty, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I also like the buns they used, which were very fresh. As for the burger, my husband truly enjoyed it. It comes in different sizes: 1/3lb, 1/2lb or 1lb. Our side order was sweet potato fries that were made fresh and just right, none of them was under cooked or burnt, just perfect. If you are hungry for a fresh hamburger or sandwich, I believe this is a good place for it. BTW, if you check in on yelp, they offer 15% discount on your order."}
{"text":"The establushment is a good one..you can build your own burger here..anything you want. On it they have it...
Decently priced and family friendly..great place to watch the game or have your first date."}
{"text":"Food court style Fuddruckers. Doesn't offer the same full menu as a regular location. No kids meals. Still tastes like Fuddruckers, just doesn't feel like one."}
{"text":"We come here 4-5x a month as our kids love it. They have great specials on Mondays and Tuesdays where kids eat free. Can't beat it! Great, friendly service, they are consistent with the cooking so you know what to expect. Only room for improvement is the veggies in the toppings bar isn't always super fresh. You can tell it's sometimes from the night before. As far as chain burger joints go, this is a no-brainer."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken sandwich is great. Nice people. The waitress was very kind and helped us make a delicious mixed soda drink. The wedges were fantastic because they were so crispy. However, they are a little stingy on the toppings even though we paid $1 for 5 pieces of mushrooms."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight, for a peaceful meal, instead, there was 4 children,running up and down the aisles of the restuarant.  Throwing toys like footballs. Yelling, screaming, then outside, standing on the tables, swinging in the tree as the parents are talking,  ignoring them, or on the phone. Parents, most of us do not enjoy your spoiled brats!  Manners  please. The oldest boy had to have been 15, at least. This is not the restuarants fault, but the parents not controlling the kids."}
{"text":"Came in here for dinner.  I wasn't too impressed about the whole place.  The staff was very good, I watched a customer in front of me heckling the girl behind the counter about the details about all burgers and chicken sandwiches.  After I ordered, they kept informing me that my order was coming up.  Food was okay; main things to order is the burgers with the different meats they have to offer.  Bit pricey for a burger.

I gave this place 3 Stars because of the ammenities bar.  I ordered a side of chili cheese fries and was able to pump some extra cheese onto my fries.  You can choose what you want to put on your burger; whole bar full of lettuces, pickles, onions, etc.  Basically, it's build your perfect burger.

Sitting area was okay, seat yourself.  You can choose to throw away your trash or leave it there.  Place was clean when I found a spot to sit down.

Parking is not a problem since it's in the same location as Target."}
{"text":"Im a fan of there Bison and Elk Burgers. Couple that with sweet potato fries and Ice water and you have a Sub 700 calorie meal. Highly recommend, focus on lean meats,"}
{"text":"The Skinny: tried the elk burger, it's okay, but the main attraction is the side bar of toppings (3) service: counter service but friendly and efficient (3) value: an exotic burger plus fries and a drink = $14? WTF?(2).

Honestly, I came here wanting to try their ostrich burger (the tastiest animal on two legs) however they're out until August 20th. So, my hubby and I shrugged and split an elk burger instead with all the trimmings - a diet Dr. Pepper (who-hoo!) and a side of seasoned fries.

First things first - really impressed by the side bar of toppings available here. Love the fresh veggie bar of fresh iceberg (cut in wedges or shredded - wedges is better, of course!), tomatoes, onions and pickles. Personally, didn't like the salsa because the tomatoes had gotten a little too mealy but that's just my taste.

The burger came out and we were impressed by the size. When we saw it, we were instantly gratified we only ordered one burger to share.

The meat itself is good - medium done. However I felt the patty lacked seasoning. Another problem with the burger was the bun. The bun was a little too large for the patty and it wasn't anything special (kind of your average hamburger bun). Although overall, the burger was okay, I'm not sure that it would justify the 7.99 pricetag.

The fries were not that great - they lacked the crispness and adequate seasoning of a good french fry. The soda however was dead good - not the watered down stuff you see at most places. My Diet Dr.Pepper pretty much tasted like it does out of a can.

My one beef with ordering an exotic burger - there are no combo deals here. You must order a drink/fries at a la carte pricing if you were to order an exotic burger. That's why it cost $14 for a burger, fries and drink.

Overall, the burger was okay, the drink was good, the fries are not worth the price. I think I'll come back when they have ostrich just to try it."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go to lunch on Monday labor day, and wanted a nice big juicy burger. We've never had nasty food at Fuddruckers so we decided to stop in here and split a big burger. We ordered the number 2. It's a huge burger 2/3 pounder, with fries and an endless refill of drinks. We also ordered a side of onion rings. I didn't see the dirtiness others have suggested in previous reviews listed. 

The restaurant is covered with memorabilia from old rock artist, we decided to sit near the Elvis corner of the building. They do have 3 or four booths in the corners but all were filled so we parked at a table and got our first of a few sodas. Right in front of us was a flat screen TV with football on.. Oh yeah, this was a nice casual atmosphere, burger, fries, football what else can you ask for. The place was pretty slow for a holiday around lunchtime, but I was OK with that. I mean I don't mind getting my food faster. 

We waited about 15 minutes and split our food up and put all the toppings we prefer on our huge burger. Yumms, it was good. Nice and juicy perfect size to split into two. I was happy by coming here, you always know what to expect. The buns are nice and fresh and the selection of toppings is wonderful. 

The only thing that bugged me was the onion rings were really greasy, so I put mine to the side. Also they must have had a district manager and manager present that afternoon, cause we kept getting starred at by people dressed in suits walking around. As soon as we were done with eating we had our plates picked up, and we hung out watching the end of the game for another 15 min or so. Thumbs up for me, I left happy and stuffed."}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego and have had wonderful experiences at Fuddruckers there. That said, I did not care so much for my meal. For one thing medium does not mean \"rare-ish\" it means a nice thin band of red. The outside of the burger was cooked but the inside was almost too rare. The chili fries were fine but I remember having them not with steak fries but shoestring. If there is a next time I'll ask.

The desert consisted of two peanut butter cookies and a blonde brownie. The peanut butter cookies were not peanut butter but sugar cookies with peanut butter chips. The brownie was the driest brownie I've had in years. It seemed almost stale.

Some people have had a wonderful experience at Fuddruckers. I have in San Diego but not this one. I'm going to think hard about going back for a second time."}
{"text":"Always a pretty good burger. If you don't like the toppings, it's your own fault. Load it up. Yum!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best hamburgers in town! The sweet potato French fries are excellent! It's awesome to be able to see them cooking your fresh made to order food! There's always fresh variety of toppings to choose from and you can put on whatever you want! Soft drinks have unlimited refills with a great selection. If you have room for the desert, I recommend the brownie!! The music is always such an awesome selection! The people who work here are so happy and friendly, something that should be a staple in every restaurant."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place! You go up to the counter & order your food & drinks. Once prepared you add your own fresh toppings to your burger. They also have a turkey and veggie burger as well & a wide array of amazing sugary treats. I opted for the banana shake & OMG... amazing! Definitely a little place to return to."}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes. Everything is always fresh and condiments are good and fresh."}
{"text":"I have ate here a few times. Place has good burgers but a bit overpriced IMO. I just went recently and the largest is a 2/3 burger, what happened to the 1 pounder! For me it was a draw to go there and munch on that massive burger but it is gone. The service there was so so but one thing that ticked me was they were out of bacon! C'mon people! You cannot have half the things on your menu showing bacon on it and not have this, get it together! Bring back the 1 pounder and have some bacon and you are 5 stars. Oh and have a deal of the day burger that is not so expensive too just my suggestion."}
{"text":"Love this place! Kids love it too! Bring quarters if you have little ones! The burgers are always hot and delicious and the condiments on point! I love that I can order without a bun and load up on veggies!"}
{"text":"Exceedingly excellent customer service. Dan and his team went out of their way to help with my boyfriend's bday party. And the food was made right in every way. They helped bring the cake out with already lit candles and initiated singing. not to mention, excellent burgers. yes their signature burgers packed with flavor. i highly recommend trying one of their exotic burgers."}
{"text":"Food super yummy! This Fuddruckers isn't as large as the others, and doesn't have as many games to offer but for a quick stop off for a good burger, this place is great. Food always predictably good, consistent ....always a family favorite when we are traveling. Wish they would come back to the South Bay!"}
{"text":"Interesting Elk and buffalo burgers were interesting and overall flavor was good, but the price was way too steep. Also veggies seemed flavorless."}
{"text":"This is inside the Orleans Casino.   Is is a small place but still the good burgers that you expect from Fuddruckers.  The service was fantastic. They ran out of lemon for my tea and they quickly replaced them.  Very friendly staff.  Also a heads up it in kinda hidden in the back of the Casino"}
{"text":"the burgers are good, but the main thing that draws me here are the unlimited toppings and selection. i love dipping my burger in jalapeno cheese and bbq sauce. so good. me and brother in law were commenting on the strange design of a load bearing post in the middle of the dining room. very strange way to design the dining area that way..."}
{"text":"My review may be a little biased because I'm a vegetarian so I can't say much for their specialty burgers. The price of the food is pretty decent. About $10 for a combo which includes the burger(toppings are free), wedges/onion rings and a drink/shake. The services is fast and friendly and they have a topping and condiment bar for you burgers and sides. My veggie burger was okay and the wedges weren't too dry. My sisters however didn't care much for their burgers. They both ordered their burgers medium rare but instead they were well done. Also the buns on the burgers are huge. Why do you guys have these huge buns? Why?! 
So overall the food was okay. Definitely not the best burgers in town but their prices are fair and you can put whatever toppings you want on it. I suppose it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Great buffalo burger!

I only eat here once every few months given that there isn't one near my house, but every time I do I am not disappointed. The buffalo burger is thick and very juicy which isn't an easy feat given its low fat content. 

The condiment bar is great. I'm very picky when it comes to the amount of condiments I put on my burgers. Restaurants (fast food and sit down alike) always put too much of everything for my taste. I've also made the mistake of ordering \"light on the [mayo, mustard, etc.]\" only to receive the most minuscule amount. At Fuddruckers I get to add everything at my own preference which of course solves this problem. The fries are also really great. Thick cut and hot every time. If you like something sweet to finish off your meal the brownie is pretty good as well!

Waiting in line can sometimes be a little lengthy. I don't blame Fuddruckers for this though (and thus did not deduct any stars). I think newcomers are initially thrown off by the meat choices and repeat customers like to switch it up. Everything is ordered a la cart also which increases order time."}
{"text":"Been coming to Fuddruckers since I was a kid, but this location since I was in college. Burgers is their go-to, but I come here for the chili cheese fries. I can get a decent lunch for less than $5 here, and still get as much food as a burger meal. Getting the chili cheese fries and maybe a toasted lone bun is all I need. I always ask for a water cup as well, no different that the regular drink cup. So I save myself another $2 there. easy as pie!

They have a fixing bar where their is an assortment of veggies and condiments to one's pleasing. There is where I can load up on additional veggies to my chili cheese fries. If you want more condiments that can fit in those white cups, just ask for a dressing cup. Now you can dip your burger into such sauce. 

Also one can order from the kids menu, and comes with a cookie as well. Fill up at the fixing bar and you can be set possibly."}
{"text":"I went here last night.... The first impression of the place was nice until you went up to order. The cashier was NOT friendly. My friend said, \"Hi, how are you doing tonight?\" Her response.... \"Can i help you?\" She also rolled her eyes at us.... 

Once we got our food it was great, tasty and delicous.... but they need customer service training badly..."}
{"text":"This is actually one of the smaller ones that I've been to of the Fuddruckers.... and I've been going to them for... wow...20 years now?

The service here was impressive...  

Yes... we waited a little longer than usual for our burger, but we were enjoying company.... 

along with the fact that it is a little smaller than the rest of the Fudd's that I've been too, were the problems of a bit of cloggage when it came to getting in line for the condiments... all good.

We had a really good experience with the wait staff too... they were helpful in getting our stuff cleared, and when my mom mentioned that they didn't have an ice-cream area like the others, the lady even improvised and made us little sundaes!!!!

There are times when I'm at different locations and different places and want to try different things... and it's been a while since I've been in LV(maybe 3 years??) but it's always nice to know when you can go back to an old trusty.

Thanks again for the great service and to know that you guys are here."}
{"text":"Great Turkey Burger, I always add avacado. Love the fries, good staff. Quick food, go here to lunch often."}
{"text":"Elk burger?  I wonder....  I requested for a \" rare,\" however, I do know \"American Medium Rare.\"  That's how it came out.  Well, I would have to ask them to grill it \"raw\" since it came out all cooked. 

Why ask \"How do you want it cooked?\" is it all looks and tastes the same."}
{"text":"I usually am a big fan of fuddruckers, I love their burgers. However, I'm disappointed with the management at this particular location. I went in with 4 other friends to do their annual 3# burger challenge, we called a day in advanced and told them how many in our party and what time we'd be there. We left a call back number, etc. We got there at noon and the employee taking out order was clearly new and had no idea what was going on, \"I didn't even know we were having a challenge till like yesterday\". The manager was very rude and said \"you wee supposed to call\". We told him we did, and I saw our name, number in our party, and 12pm written on their paper. He told us it would take 40 minutes to cook, which is understandable, but defeated the purpose of calling the day before to tell them how many were coming and what time we'd be there. We didn't have time to wait 40 minutes and then eat the burger for an hour. Manager was very rude and annoyed that we even wanted to attempt the challenge. 

Good food but poor management. Go to a different location."}
{"text":"Fuddruckers is your all American food place,  we ate  here tonight because we couldn't decide on where to go so we picked a \"safe\" place.  Ha.  I had the grilled chicken sand with green Chile,  omg I love this sand,  so juicy and flavorful and their homemade bread really seals the deal.  My daughter had the chick ceasar salad and loved it,  they put a ton of chicken,  her dad got the works burger,  I didn't try it but it looked amazing.  The fries and onion rings were both great and their bar of condiments is fresh and easy to get to,  fresh lettuce,  tomatoes, onions, pickles,  relish,  mayo,  ketchup  mustard,  nacho cheese and BBQ sauce.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  They have the best shakes too."}
{"text":"Not too bad. Nice to see different size burgers. Fries are good. Nice to get a bacon cheeseburger with fries and a orange soda. 
They have a complete range or items you can add to your burger. 
And being that I'm a little older I think but they gave me a discount."}
{"text":"good, had the kobe burger but i couldnt tell the difference in tase compared to a normal beef burger."}
{"text":"The food has not been tasting as good as the first time I went. the bread that came  with my salad tasted old. And the last time I went my fryes and humberger weren't very good. I'm not going back"}
{"text":"My kids just love this place! They love how they can build their own burgers! 
It's a little on the pricey side though....
I like their spicy nacho cheese on my burger and potato wedges. Super tasty! And I love how their veggies are always fresh and crisp, never soggy and wilted! And they have red onions! Yummy! I like their buffalo burger! Quite juicy and super tasty! Cute little place!"}
{"text":"Heard the food was good. My boys & I first visit here. Wasn't impressed. 
I won't be back..."}
{"text":"Try come here everytime we are in Vegas.  Great burgers.  Only down side was men's bathroom was not very clean, nor did it smell good."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised about all the 5 star ratings. This is a good restaurant if you have children from toddler through middle school age. If you don't have children in tow you might want to visit another restaurant. Visited the Middleton restaurant on Nov. 14, 2015. It's new, very bright, clean. Overall the food was pretty good with a few exceptions. I ordered the Southwest chicken salad. A large salad, with sour cream, guacamole, choice of dressing and one piece of toasted bread. The guacamole wasn't fresh, I immediately noticed the dark color of it. My husband ordered a single cheeseburger with chili cheese fries. FYI: If you order the chili cheese fries with your combo meal there is an up charge. We weren't told about the extra charge by the cashier. My husband said the burger was pretty good and cooked the way he asked. The chili cheese fries were overcooked - more like mashed potato skins with chili on top. The restaurant temperature was very cold when we were there. I never took my jacket off and my knees were knocking together as I shivered through my meal. I counted 12 TVs and not one person watching any of them. A good restaurant for kids, but we'll be heading elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Not cool....not cool at all!   My hubby and son have been weekly customers at this location for a very long time, but last week was their last visit.  Hubby, a Vietnam Veteran was always given a Veterans discount of 10% it came out to about $1.00 on a $23. to $25. total bill.  Remember he was paying full price for our son's meal and a 10% discount on his meal.   When he placed his order last week he was told \"no more Veterans discount....only active duty Military.\"   Well....bu bye Fuddruckers!  Your absolutely shameful!  They are off to Smashburger next week and the week after and the week after and so on........."}
{"text":"This one is consistent every time I come to this restaurant.
Good flavor, good service. 
On occasion the fixings selection is a little \"off\". Brown lettuce and those tasteless winter tomatoes. But the good thing about a burger is that they are still good wiht just the basics."}
{"text":"I really like Fuddruckers and have for years. Their food is consistently great. I have been to this location the most in my 20+ years in the Valley.
They have been 5 stars easily every time I have eaten here. However, I have always ordered pretty much the same items. The last time I came I had to try the pretzel bun for an extra buck. Everything was the usual 5 stars, but the bun was a complete let down. Not because the taste, but because of the employee who assembled the burger. Half the bun was dry. I cannot understand why anyone who is payed to simply put a patty on a bun cannot \"feel\" it is dry. 
This is more of a notice to managers to teach their employees the difference between FRESH (One their main marketing hypes) and NOT fresh. 
This is based on a visit on 10/17 at approx 1 PM.

p.s They changed the Onion Ring batter to a much lighter batter that is a real improvement IMO. I like the Onion RIngs even more now."}
{"text":"I went to Fuddruckers simply because I was walking by it and it was lunch time and I didn't want to wait so long at Oregano's.  There is something funny yet gay in the name of Fuddruckers and that they sell fresh meat (a la Fudgefuckers).  Although the yellow awnings have always annoyed me, it does foreshadow the circus like atmosphere once you step inside.  This is one of those family restaurants that believe in throwing some old junk and memorabilia on the walls and think it's a fun local place.  If you are going to put up an old football helmet, put the whole thing up, not just half of it.  Those half ones were never used, not even in the special Olympics.  With the smell of an old garage and unsurprisingly a bunch of overweight patrons, this place was not fun and certainly not gay.  Interestingly, there were lots of skinny men in this place; they need all the protein and blood they can get.
So for 12 bucks I got the 1/2lb bacon cheeseburger and fries.  It was great the cashier (I think he was the manager, and gay to boot; must been attracted to the name) told me that the meal deal was a better deal.  That saved me like a dollar and since no tip jar was around, I stuffed it into my front pocket.
Although the steak fries were a little too peppery, they were good.  Not soggy, not overly crisp or oily.  The hamburger was good.  Not the best, but good.  It was cooked to my satisfaction.  Props to the immigrant cook staff for getting the cooking right.

+++'s:
Decent food, bottled beer on ice, friendly service, good cooks, fresh and filled condiment buffet, fun to squirt your own ketchup and mustard from the buffet area, free refills, outdoor patio, not too busy for weekday lunch time

- - -'s:
Chintzy décor, no eye candy, a tad overpriced for what you get, yellow circus awnings, drab atmosphere, no wifi

In sum, if you are in the mood for a hamburger, a quick bite to eat, and are in the vicinity of a Fuddruckers, this place delivers.  If you are looking for a real local place, fun atmosphere, and better food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was fine, but the silverware all looked filthy and they advertise honey mustard dressing for salads when what it actually is is just honey mustard, not dressing. They were not happy when I asked about this, so I bet they hear it a lot."}
{"text":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTRAUNT EVER!!!!! I love this place so much and its perfect for when i go shopping at the mall. I have gone 2 times in a day before i just love it. Its a nice atmosphere and good food. I always go with my boyfriend and get a turkey burger wrapped in a TON of lettuce. Its so good i havent gone over in a while but every time i do they never disapoint"}
{"text":"Legitimately so disappointed!!!!!! Dry burgers! Not ketchup! No mustard! No Mayo! You gave me literally 10 French fries and 6 onions rings!!!!! $35!!!!! Wow! A basket of fries for 2 people was 10 French fries and 6 onion rings! Horrible!"}
{"text":"Very dirty!!! Place was a hot mess! Maybe 5 tables sat with customers and the rest dirty, we had to clean our own table just to sit down. Durning our meal a worker starts to vacuum, are you serious!!!!! She said she was sorry she wasn't on the floor our whole meal because she was busy fixing the dishwasher because it leaks water everywhere and they have towels all over the floor. We WONT be back!!!! This place is disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this wonderful place with my husband many times and every time we come here to eat, we always get great food and outstanding customer service. The place is always clean. The location is right off the freeway which is very convenient. The price is reasonable but better if you have coupon (be sure to sign up with your email when you get a chance). I recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to eat with family, friends or even a special someone.

{"text":"This is a chain burger place, but they do make the burgers fresh and let you dress them yourself.  Granted, this same scenario plays out a thousand times better at The Chuck Box in Tempe, however,  The Chuck Box lacks one thing...a nacho cheese pump!  Oh, glorious plastic cheese that you can pump on your fries to your heart's desire.  Heck, pump it on to your burger if you want!    

Three stars for the burgers and one star for the vat of cheese."}
{"text":"What happened to the seasoned french fries, those were real good, the ones we had we lame and kind of lame. As  usual the burgers were awesome, 
One thing I did notice that a small kid was having trouble reaching the soda fountain to select her drink. maybe a small stepp might help."}
{"text":"Definitely was a childhood favorite! Haven't been in years! My experience here was horrible! I went in a Monday witch I guess kids get to eat for 99 cents. Girl at the cashier completely over charged me then did a return not handing me my whole  entire amount of money needed to be returned back...  was confused but  I work in retail so was understanding her. She should of handed me my return money then re rang my kids 99 cent meals! She had a horrible attitude which I get end of night everyone has their days! Went to take my kids to the restroom..... ummm can we just say when was the last time you dusted your vents??????? Fucking disgusting!!!!! This is a restaurant! It should be smelling like sanitizer and bleach in your f****** bathroom! Obviously they clearly do not clean up and maintenance the restaurant very well! I do not think I will ever come again thanks for ruining my childhood favorite! :("}
{"text":"We ate here tonight and it was an awful experience, the staff here is as rude as it gets. It's a very uncomfortable and hostile environment. The manager, I didn't get her name, (brown hair, I think it was Michelle S.or something) was just as rude as possible. Both to my husband and to other people in the restaurant. The employees are unprofessional, it made the dining experience uncomfortable. I won't be back. It makes you feel like your an unwanted guest at someone's house.  There are too many establishments on bell to choose from. This place needs new management or any at all!"}
{"text":"The burgers were decent sized, but they were only okay.  There are definitely plenty of better options in Madison for burgers.  I'm glad we went here with a BOGO coupon."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but the quality shines through in this burger joint. Best of all are the tasty steak fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"Friend people, great serves. I'm just not a fan of their food... The meat doesn't have much flavor and I ordered chili fries and I don't care much for their chili or their French fries... I've only eat at the one in Vegas so not sure if it's all locations or just this location."}
{"text":"I come here because I love that I can have elk and bison which are much leaner than beef. It didn't hurt that I had a coupon for a free burger for my birthday, which meant that I wasn't going to pass up a chance at a juicy patty with fresh veggies and cheese on top. I always skip the bun, and never go for combos, the portions are overly generous even at 1/3 of a pound as it is. I love it and always will."}
{"text":"Wow big disappointment here..Ordered 1/3 MR. Meat was watery and the cheese had not melted and the bun was a disaster. No seasoning on the meat and the fries are now miniaturized...Get it together Fudds Be back in 6 months."}
{"text":"i usually have good things to say....unfortunately my burger was over cooked and you know what that means....should have sent it back..."}
{"text":"There was a large roach on the floor. Right after I got my food, I sat down and took one bite and here comes a big roach on the floor heading straight for my feet. I had to pick up my food and move to another table. I couldn't even finish my food because it was on my mind the entire time. When you have a restaurant you should have tile floors, never carpet..!!!!  Tile floors can be cleaned and bleached when needed...  A roach can live for six months on one crumb of food and carpet traps crumbs, I'm looking at the floor in here and its littered with crumbs and little fragments of things. When I alerted the staff, the manager came out and got the roach. Instead of offering me a free meal or some type of refund he just casually apologized and said he needed to call the pest control. If it was my business I would be doing more than just a simple \"I'm sorry\" in this situation. Three mistakes here 
1) the carpet
2) the roach 
3) the managers response to the roach"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting!!  The bun was dry and stale.  The veggie burger was yucky... I don't think I have ever had one I didn't like before.  The kids meals are miniscule.  The topping bar is so simple and plain.  The dips are not very good... cheese dip is YUCK!  Drink choices stink.  Cookies taste raw and boring.  Almost forgot to add that the two young kids didn't even care for the french fries because they are seasoned.  I thought they were a total waste of calories.  I can't believe the prices either... so not cheap or even worth what you pay for."}
{"text":"Party of 18. Just as we are deciding our orders the computer system crashes. All orders taken by hand. They handled it very well. All orders were accurate and once submitted ready in a very decent amount of time. 

Very good burgers. Warm inside but crispy on the outside fries. Will definitely be back again and again. Will definitely try the kobe beef burger. It looked delicious when I saw it on another plate. 

Nice environment. Some kid entertainment. Spacious seating. and very reasonable prices. 5 stars well deserved."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger late night (sometime between 2 and 3 am). This was my first time eating there,ordered a burger well done. Didn't take as long as I thought (only like 7-10 minutes). The burger was much smaller than I expected for the price, but it tasted good. The fries were really starchy, probably because of how thick the wedges are. It's alright, I'll probably give it another try but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Food is good, but probably the rudest staff I've ever encountered in a fast food restaurant in Arizona."}
{"text":"Best burger in town. MARCUS is the most friendly manager and somehow always remembers my name. Food is always great as well as service!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Best crispy chicken sandwich anyone could ever eat! I love love love their honey mustard!!!Staff is always friendly when I come here!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Juicy burgers perfectly cooked to order. Fast friendly service. Plenty of choices and priced well for the quality!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy. The only thing I don't like about this area is the tiny driveway, almost not enough for fit 2 cars going in and out. This is a great burger joint for large groups. Love the condiments offered, especially the liquid cheese!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Their chili is pretty good, too."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Fuddruckers. The burger is decent the service is adequate and the atmosphere is nice. The music on the radio is late seventies to early eighties soft music. Nice place to come for lunch."}
{"text":"fuddruckers didn't do it for me. so, driving in the summerlin area, ive always asked around how is fuddruckers and surprisingly many have said it was \"bomb\" not knowing what to expect i met up with friends and ordered the 1/3rd works combo. patty, mushrooms, and choice of cheese- american with fries and onion rings.. waited a couple of minutes and our order was ready, went to the counter to pick up and my food wasn't finish, they forgot my mushrooms... so after that fix i noticed that my cheeseburger was plan. i was unaware of the buffet corner to dress your own toppings, lol. i love that i had unlimited banana peppers! well, of course you can customize your burger to fit your taste buds, but my burger was overcooked and nothing about my order stood out for a fuddruckers speciality. if youve tried innout, you love the sauce or customized burger, or even five guys order to how you like it with cajun fries wish is overpowering seasoning, each burger joint has it's \"speciality\" but me for fuddruckers, was a burger you eat at backyard bbq. my $9 burger fries and rings wasn't all that \"jazz\" when i can make my own =/ so two stars for effort and happy staff!"}
{"text":"Don't you hate it when you accidentally hit the jalapeño cheese pump like 5 times too many on your fries?...........ya, me neither.  

Not much wrong with this place."}
{"text":"My wife requested a Mother's Day visit here. This is the old Cheeseburger In Paradise spot. Dark and crowded before. Bright and airy now. You order at the counter and they give you a pager to let you know when your food is ready for pick up. They have burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, wraps nachos, etc. Their burgers can be in 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3 pound sizes. They have a condiment bar with fresh lettuce, pickles, olives, onions, and hot pump cheese. 

There was a minimum of staff today at lunch about 1:30 pm. But the place was not busy, so understandable.  They also have two self serve soft drink fountains with multiple combinations available.

Two kids got the burgers, all of which were hot and tasty. Avocado as well as all of the other toppings were very fresh. Wife had the veggie burger which was also good though a basic tempeh burger. I had a chef salad which was just a chef salad. Nothing spectacular or noteworthy but nothing to send back to the kitchen either. Fries (which come with a drink when ordered as a basket with an entrée) were thick wedges, well seasoned but were coldish and soggy. We also had the chicken nachos which were smaller than one would expect for the $7 price. 

Wife noted that the pump cheese was very thin and not flavorful as in other locations. She was looking to this part of the meal the most!  They included it on the chicken nachos which detracted from the dish. 

For four lunch entrées and three soft drinks and exclusive of tip, our bill was $65.  Pretty high for the quantity of food. But the quality was not bad, so fair enough. 

We would recommend this for a fun family or friend get together where atmosphere and novelty are more important than price or value. But since we live here in town, after having our first visit, we will not add this to our regular rotation when we are OK spending $65 for four at a cheeseburger place. 

By the way, they also have an outside seating area which is very pleasant and plenty of parking. The space is also very well laid out for our handicap challenged friends. So good for Fuddruckers!

See you on Yelp. Yelp on!"}
{"text":"I have ate here about 8 times and they always have great bugers here. I have never had a real bad experence here only thing I can point to was my wife found a long grey hair in her food from an older lady who worked there but other than that great palce to eat. 
They need to find a way to clean some of the tables in the back room your fingers stick to them a little bit just make sure to keep your food on your plate.
They also offer other type of bugers such as Buffalo, Turkey, Elk, Fish...etc so there is a lot to type and come back to test out. I have never been brave enough to try one of the other burgers even though I hear they are really good, look for a review in the future. 
I also love the milk shakes they serve here, strawberry is the best. Not only do they fill up your glass but they give you the rest in what they use to blend it."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The burgers are the bomb & the fud fries are delicious!! 
Relaxing atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a Fuddruckers in a food court. It was no different than going to the sit down restaurant. The burger was excellent, the fresh vegetables for your burger was awesome. They have the nacho cheese for your fries. The staff does a very good job from the cashier to the cooks. I will be returning."}
{"text":"The manager aka team lead or whatever is crazy..she looks like she is going to explode.....stay away customer service is bad and if you complain to corporate they don't respond. They just straight up don't care..never again fudjoker your place is a zoo"}
{"text":"No management present. Cleanliness and repairs are not up to Fuddruckers standards. They don't appear to be booking parties at this location."}
{"text":"I love Fuddruckers! I have childhood memories of visiting when on vacation and loving it - and it still holds true today. This last time, I got the chili cheese dog and my wife got a hamburger. Their staff was extremely friendly and they made our food quickly. I love being able to manage our toppings ourselves. The place was clean. It was pretty busy, but we went on a Friday night. I would highly recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant.  We visited them on July 15 2016. Cock roaches in the dinning area. Notified the manager Kia And he didn't seen to think this was alarming issue.  We paid with credit card and Kia was to credit us back within two hours 24 hours later no refund   I wouldn't had given them any stars but had to to write this review"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Fuddruckers for about 20 years... now I know why.  Cashier was nice and very helpful.  I ordered bacon cheese burger combo.  Fries were only warm, not hot.  Burger was not very tasty and it was full of gristle bits... you know the ones that stick between your teeth.  Lots of trash on the floor.  After we were finished, someone came to ask how things were.  I told here about the fries and she offered to get me more; I declined.  She offered a free dessert: I accepted.  In all, not a good experience, will probably be at least another 20 years before I go back."}
{"text":"I can't give it a lower review. I only started my review because I've been throwing up all night from raw turkey  they serviced me.  After put it in the hamburger  my daughter ordered. . When I went up to advise them as I was walking out because I knew I needed to get home to get sick . The reply was ...  that's just a little raw.  They should not be cooking in any shape or form.  I'll stick to fatburger turkey burgers after I get the health department over to this place."}
{"text":"After a disappointing outing to the neighboring Sushi restaurant, my group and I landed at the food court within the Orleans.  It is open 24 hours and pretty reliable.  I ordered the sunrise burger while the rest of my party ordered steak sandwiches.  The sunrise burger is egg, bacon, and cheese on top of a patty.  It was really good.  The bacon was crisp, the egg was a little runny, and the patty was well seasoned.  The steak sandwiches were reported well seasoned and tender.  However, the temperatures were not correct.  This is the sort of the thing that many people find unforgivable.  However, I will always give leeway to a fast food restaurant in this area.

The seating is pretty horrible.  There are only a few seats for four different eateries.

The service is okay but could be improved.  The cashier did not seem to know about the product and did not want to honor casino coupons.  However, a supervisor remedied the situation quickly.

The prices are a little high for burgers but not unconscionable.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"We have been to Fuddruckers off and on for years! They have the best burgers and I am pretty sure it's because all the burgers are fresh and cooked to order at time of order.

Fresh food is king!

Anyways, as others have mentioned, yes it can be expensive but when your frugal like me you can make it work.

I get the 2/3 pound burger for like $8 with no fries. This thing is huge especially when you add your toppings. Cheese is like a $1 extra.

The last few times we have been there we get a coupon on the receipt for a grilled chicken sandwich, drink (Soda) and fries for $8 and my wife loves chicken sandwiches so score!

Since we go on Monday's after 4PM kids meals at this location are only like $1 and it comes with a burger, fries, drink and a cookie.

The kids burger is huge especially with toppings therefore my nine year old son is tapping out after finishing his burger.

The chicken sandwich is a good size as well with toppings so with that being said I raid my son's and wife's french fries but they don't care because they are stuffed and can't eat all the fries anyway LOL plus I share their soda.

For my family, everything mentioned above with coupon, kids meal special on a Monday after 4PM we spend less than $20 and we are completely full and satisfied until the next day."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Fuddruckers in quite a while, but it seems as if the quality of hamburger patty has changed dramatically (downhill).  

1. The toppings bar is nice and synonymous with Fuddruckers.
2. The onion rings were very good, and the cashier did a nice job of explaining why some people like or dislike them.   Some consider them a bit spicy, which is actually what prompted me to order them.
3. They have the Coca-Cola flavor machines, which is a great plus...I love the vanilla.
4. Monday's you can get a kid's meal for .99 with the purchase of an adult combo - great deal!
5. The bourbon onions on my burger were a nice additional and offset the subpar burger flavor."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just want a fat, juicy, really good burger. For those times, I usually hit up Fuddruckers. At Fuddys, I always know what I am gonna get. For those of you not familiar with Fuddys, its a walk up to order deal where you choose the size, style, and doneness of your burger, all sides are separate, and you get to choose your toppings from a buffet of everything you could imagine to go on a burger. NOW THAT'S A BURGER! I always get the smallest burger, no cheese (you will hear why in a second) with a large side of fries for me and the hubby to share. 
Now I am gonna let ya in on a little secret... They have free unlimited nacho cheese sauce!!!!!!!!!     :O    Now this is gonna probably sound a bit crazy and gross but I love nacho cheese sauce! I love it so much that I think a nacho cheese fountain would be incredible and I would buy one to have at every single event I throw. I literally could drink the stuff! So there you go, and insiders secret: save yourself some money and do not order cheese on your burger and just lode it with nacho cheese sauce. Unless of course you are some crazy uptight weirdo that doesn't like cheese sauce... In that case, I would say you probably don't belong at Fuddys. Oh yeah, I like to also drench my fries in that exquisite sauce. Soooo yummy. 
K so before wrapping up this review, I am going to be kind and let you all in on my secret burger recipe that I make every time I am at Fuddruckers. Get ready for a total foodgasm! I like to call it a \"Jenn's Nacho Burger.\" I get a plain burger and put tons of nacho cheese (the regular kind but you can get the spicy cheese if you like more spice, oh yeah forgot to mention there are two kinds, what what!), salsa/ pico de gallo (yes they have it and its perfectly square chunks of tomato, onion, jalapenos, and some cilantro), extra diced onions (what can I say, I am an onion lover), and some jalapenos. YUM!!! You can send me a message to thank me later   :O 
So moving on from the foodporn, I would say the service here is ok. Its nice that you don't have someone waiting on you so you do not have to tip. Nevertheless, the people you encounter for a whole 2 minutes to order your food from have always been friendly. As for the atmosphere,  this location, like most of their locations, are a bit dark and dreary with dated decor. This is also a total family spot so there are kids running around everywhere. Unfortunately, Fuddy's would have gotten five stars if it were not for this and the fact that once or twice, my burger was overcooked. Oh well, nothing unlimited nacho cheese can't fix!"}
{"text":"2 stars for the food. It's good, but the service is terrible. I went there three times in the last few weeks, because my kids like the place. All three times I ordered my burger on a bed of lettuce instead of the bun. All three times I received my burger on a bun. The staff didn't seem too concerned. There are too many other good burger places, so I'll take my kids somewhere else in future."}
{"text":"I like this place. Not my first time here and of course won't be the last. The restaurant is always pretty full; the last time we were here the line was out the door!
Their meals are priced well and the choice of sizes for their burgers is a very good option. Choose your size based on how hungry you are! They have many different burgers, from the traditional burger to the special ones, they have good choices for everyone. Today I went for the original burger meal. I also ordered a side of onions rings. All their food is always fresh and hot and it doesn't take a long time for you to get your perfectly cooked burger. The onions rings are crispy and hot, I love that. Hate soggy ones! My husband ordered the mushroom and Swiss burger. He said it was great too! 
You can choose your toppings from the bar and can add as much as you want to your burger. You also can add whatever amount of ketchup, mayo, mustard, hot cheese sauce. All available to you too. Fountain drinks available for refill. Everything about the experience of eating here is very pleasant. I recommend it to family and friends and would definitely recommend it to everyone else."}
{"text":"Well I want to start off by saying that fudds really does make a great burger. With that being said I found out that they also do a footlong chili cheese dog that is awesome too. Can't forget that they serve that awesome cheese in the pump! Where else would anyone find that? Add as much condiments as you want and make the burger yours! This location is always busy but the employees ( from the times I've been here ) always seem to be very pleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"Excellence!

I tried many burger joints all over and let me tell you this has to be the best joint i tried. I didn't just ate here once either. I ate it 4 times!

Burger is made to order. Onionrings compliments the burger so good! I had the southwest burger and one with mushroom. Also had breakfast eggs benedict. Each time was delicious! 

The plus side was the condiment station! I load my burger with tomatoe extra onions n whatever i like. Never seen a joint that allows you to pick your burger condiments. 

The bun was the star of the burger. So delicious and toast perfectly. 

Oh fuddruckers! I yearn for you!"}
{"text":"This place has the juiciest burgers. I love the unlimited toppings bar. I like that they make the food to order so the burgers aren't sitting under a heat lamp drying out. I wish there was a location closer to our side of town."}
{"text":"Serious yum. Fuddruckers is the perfect place for any picky eater. You can pick the size of the burger, how well done it is and you can put your own toppings on.. what more could you ask for?! The fries are really potato wedges with a super tasty seasoning. Staff was friendly, restaurant was clean and there is plenty of seating. Twi thumbs up from this girl."}
{"text":"Amazing hamburger, tender, juicy. cooked to perfection . 4 lunches, 4 happy satisfied customers. Being able to put on my own condiments is great. May be a  little pricey but well worth it. Nice atmosphere nice friendly staff  a pleasure  to dine in there. Thank you we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on Tuesday afternoon to enjoy a nice ribeye sandwich with the hubby. The gentleman at the register says \"I don't have any ribeye, I prepped six of them yesterday and had to throw them out because no one bought them\". WTH, really, I was like ok, guess we weren't meant to have them. He proceeded to say that he throws out a lot of them, \"they just aren't that popular\". Ok, I get it, you don't have the ribeye sandwich, really no need to continue. Ended up leaving and having lunch somewhere else. I have gone to the one in Burbank, CA for years and have never heard of them NOT having the ribeye. Oh well thats the benefit of living in Las Vegas, lots of choices. I don't expect this place will be in business very much longer."}
{"text":"Way overpriced, it was $11 for a burger no sides and a fountain drink. The food was okay at best"}
{"text":"Used to eat the one in NY when I was a teenager, it was ok back then (better than most burger joints with more options/fresher ingredients, at a slightly premium price for what it is), heard they had one at the Orleans so tried it before a movie.

Was pretty good, quality was about the same as what I remembered, but options were a little more interesting, i.e Burger with balsamic roasted onions, bacon, bleu cheese, etc... - very good, sides were good, sliders were a good option for kids, and fresh toppings were as I remembered.  

Good option for a burger.  Service is fairly matter of fact, to be expected in the food court of a casino."}
{"text":"Good burgers, not great, but good. Potato wedges average. Cleanliness, they need to look that word up, staff was \"I'd rather be elsewhere attitude \""}
{"text":"Best...burgers....anywhere.  
Great food and excellent price. Everyone can add what they want. One of the better places to please the whole family. Staff are great."}
{"text":"Fuddruckers was a new burger joint to me, and it definitely didn't disappoint .  The burgers are often described as exotic, but it's basically \"create your own\".  Your given options, choices, and variety.  There is a simple elegance in a burger joint that really lets you have your food the way you want it.  I appreciated the cleanliness of the restaurant as much as the menu.  The staff was very helpful in going over the extensive menu with me being a newbie to the location.  

Overall, the burgers were filling and bursting with flavor.  I would definitely say they hold a high place on my list of burger places; putting them in the same tier as Burger Bar at Mandalay and Stripburger outside Fashion show as the best-of-the-best I've sampled.  Another beauty of Fuddruckers is the price tag and location off the strip."}
{"text":"This place was one of my favorite places to eat at while I was growing up in California.  I can't believe I've come across another. It brought back so many memories of when my dad use to take us out to eat as a family. 

The thing I remember most about them was their huge burgers with the cheese sauce. Of course at a young age I was never able to finish and it's still hard to. I like the way you can dress your burgers with their fresh condiments. The restaurant is always well kept."}
{"text":"You know how in the first Ghostbusters movie how Sigourney Weaver's apartment building was a conduit for negative and dark forces because of rituals that had transpired that caused the framework to work as an inherently evil gateway to be used by Gozer?

That's how I kind of feel about this place.  Only, instead of being a gateway for evil, it's more like a gateway for absent-minded people who will stand in your way and/or walk behind you MUCH TOO CLOSE.  You know the kind of people I'm talking about.  The people who made it why the sneeze-guard had to be invented... people so careless and dumb they'll sneeze on food.

This place is depressing.  It's true.  I mean, it's as though everyone in town who wants to bitch and moan and ooze out piss and vinegar decided to come to Fuddrucker's.  

This is a shame because I actually really enjoy the burgers.  I think they're fabulous.  And the fries are really good.  They're those potato wedges with the skins that I enjoy.  They have a make your own burger bar and their to go system is brilliant.  They give you enough cups for everything so that you can make 100% sure that your burger will NOT be soggy.  It never is.  

Plus, and this is a bonus, they have round pickle slices for your burger and they also have like those half pickles, too.  So, you can have a pickle on the side without looking like a pickle-slice collecting weirdo.

I do think the food is great, but I hate, hate, fucking HATE going inside.  It's depressing to me.  It's not dirty or filthy, but the building works as the antijoy.  It saps your joy in the same way that antimatter can make things seize to exist and create gnarly explosions.

If you can get in and out really quick, you will get a great burger."}
{"text":"The hand made buns they put on the griddle with butter (gives it that buttery crusty edge) are probably what makes this place so good.  But I love the flavorful beef, and I LOVE being able to do my own super fresh crunchy veggie toppings. And sauces.  And don't get me started on the hot melty cheese sauce you can pour all over everything."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers, I like the fact you can like build your own burger kind of with all of toppings and such you have on the side. I ordered a regular cheeseburger meal, patty was basic small patty, nothing fancy. Sweet potatoes fries were pretty good and so were the onions rings. The buffalo/ bison burger was a very large patty, very juicy, delicious.. a whole lot bigger than the regular cheeseburger. It was pretty good. 

It's a pretty small location in the casino but service is friendly, we waited about 12-15 mins for food. I didn't necessarily like that it was inside a casino.."}
{"text":"Love the burger protein options. The Elk burger is just too good! I like the fresh toppings available but wish they were a bit better quality. Also they are not replentished as quickly as they should be. I think it's a bit on the pricy side, but burgers are cooked pretty nicely and don't have a complaint about the meat quality. The fries and onion rings are great, but the milk shakes are pretty average. Save your money and make one at home.  

Plan on ~$15 per person. Fun place for kids, and food is kid friendly. Sometimes on weekend they have a balloon maker as well. Have seen many kids sports teams having meals here. Coupons are sometimes available, but grab them when you see them as they are rare. I wish there were more of these in town, as I have to travel across town to eat here.  They also have recently added breakfast to their menu."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Fuddruckers. I was excited to see this place when I was driving past the mall and stopped for lunch. I like that you can order a 1/3 or 1/2 pound burger depending on your wallet or hunger level. It's always an added bonus to add your own toppings instead of someone in the back doing it. For example, I like mustard on my burger but don't want it drenched in mustard or on the bun.

I usually order the Bison Burger but decided to order the manager's lunch special for $6.99. That includes a 1/3 pound burger plus a drink and wedge fries. I don't know if wedge fries is the proper term but I forgot how good they were. So I'll be back."}
{"text":"Outside it might look dead but mmm its good! Definitely recommend. Lots of seating and great service. I waited about 5 minutes for my order. Lots of freshly sliced produce and a variety of sauces even nacho cheese! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"OMG!  Hadn't visited one of these chains in YEARS!  Went with a friend last Sunday afternoon and had the best burger around!  I'm definitely putting this on my list of stops.  My hubby loves burgers so this is going to be on our regular route.  They have the most amazing and CLEAN buffet of all you can pile on yummy toppings. The fries, well I ate everyone one; although I think they could be better.

They had a great option of meats, whole wheat or white bun and again the buffet of toppings. 

We split a 2/3 pounder and it was more than enough.  If all you want is a hot juicy burger and fries this is the spot.  I know enough about beef to know theirs is top notch!"}
{"text":"Okay, I go where my clients ask me to go sometimes, and this just happened to be the location.  I do like the fact that these hamburgers are what you want, made to order the way you want and they are pretty quick, but come on, it's a hamburger....

Okay, so I ordered the Chipolte BBQ burger with fries and a shake.  Really everything was good, the Chipolte had to be the least spicy version you could get and still have the word Chipolte in it, actually, I think they should just drop the Chipolte part and call it a Bacon BBQ burger, because that is all it really tasted like to me.

I do like the fries, they are bigger than your McDonald's version and the japlipeno cheese sauce is good (again not very spicy), but it's one of my favorite items.  The shakes are real, not that comes right from a machine thing, they actually have mixers and do the work and you can tell.

Client was happy, I was happy, and I would return when asked to."}
{"text":"I went to pick up food from an order that I placed online. When we got there, this lady that appeared to maybe have been the manager pointed to the food sitting on the counter. When I went to go grab it she just put the bags on the counter and walked away so I had to call her back to get the cups which when she gave them to me she was rude about it. I gave it two stars cause the food was good though."}
{"text":"Food is good. Burgers are very much above average. Tasty fries and onion rings. It is unfortunate that the experience here is ruined by the indoor temperature. On a hot day you expect to eat in a nice, cool restaurant. Not here. It felt like it was 90 degrees inside. Would have been 5 stars otherwise, but it was so uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I'd go back.
I don't eat burgers, so I oped for a grilled chicken sandwich... was pretty damn tasty.

My favorfite part is the self help bar with toppings and all the various dips!
I helped myself to quite a bit of nacho cheese that I then dipped everything in.  Healthy."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long time. I forgot how good the crispy chicken sandwich's are here. We really enjoyed dinner here today the the service was good. They even gave the kids a free cookie. We will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Was there last night for a dinner/meeting with car club. It was perfect for that as all 25+ would have wanted separate checks and that is always a problem for the servers. Being that Fuds is a self serve, go to the counter and order kind of place, it worked out fine. They even gave us an area away from the main area to eat and hold our meeting. The only problem was that it was in the video arcade area and every time someone got on the motorcycle riding game, the meeting was drowned out by the roar of the motorcycle noise....but is was tolerable. Food wise, they offer a wide variety of burgers, in different sizes. Also nice is that they have a large self serve bar where you can put whatever you want on the burger, all the usual condiments plus peppers. two varieties or pickles and a bunch of other things. I chose a roasted chicken salad and added a few things from the bar, like extra tomatoes, pickles, etc.  The roasted chicken salad was good, the amount of chicken was very good. For the price, I was happy with what I got. Most of the others got burgers or different sizes, everyone seemed to finish all that they purchased and I did not hear any complaints. There was even a vote to meet there again next month and that passed. This was partly because or location, with some coming from Prescott, and others from all over the valley. This was my first time at Fuds, I probably would not put it on my regular list as there was nothing special about it, but I will be back next month with the club."}
{"text":"always liked fudruckers, my favorite is a cajun chicken sandwich. have not been on their menu for a while. it's a grilled chicken sandwich with grilled onions, pepper jack cheese, and a cajun sauce. this has been my favorite for years. of course you have to have their fries with the jalapeno cheese sauce. this location is a little dirty, but they have a lot of customers coming in and out. had a great meal with the family."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers for the price. 
There portions are huge ... 
you add your own toppings so you can add as much as you can fit on your plate"}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place, and for awhile I blew it off as just another exaggerated story about some cheap burger joint.

I stand corrected.

Fuddruckers is a great burger joint, surprisingly nice and with a great menu.  They have everything from elk to buffalo, ostrich and veggie burgers.  What I like is that you put on your own toppings, so I can pile the extra lettuce on myself!  I love the fact that they have a nice list of options for sides, a killer fish sandwich, and several choices for other burger toppings.  I also love their freshly baked buns.  They have a kids menu that simple, too.  There's definitely something for everyone.

I ordered the classic burger and we shared a fish sandwich.  I have to say that the burgers are really good.  Nice and juicy and not small AT ALL.  1/2 pound is the size they start at!  The bread has just the right sweetness and softness, and with the toppings I like on it, it was downright yummy.  My favorite, though, is their fried fish sandwich.  It has just the right crispiness on the outside and really good, tender, juicy fish inside.  Their tartar sauce is good, too.

If you're looking for a great burger place with variety, one that has a great eating area, a topping bar so you can make it your way, and for a great price, stop by here.  I'm honestly craving that fried fish sandwich right now!

Oh, and they have freshly baked cookies and brownies, too.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Hallelujah! I ordered my Bacon Cheddar Burger at Medium and it arrived with a little pink in the middle! 
The toppings bars was clean, tidy and well stocked. 
It was lovely and quiet for a late lunch. The provided paging system started vibrating in a relatively short amount of time.
I am docking one star because despite the restaurant's obvious downtime, there was still trash in the dining area. Stay busy and keep the whole place clean and I will totally grant the additional star."}
{"text":"I was at the Orleans and needed a quick lunch before an appointment, meaning one of the fast food choices in their food court area. I hadn't eaten at a Fuddruckers in ages so decided to give it a try.
The staff was exceptionally perky.
I got a cheeseburger, fries, and chocolate shake. The shake was pretty good, at least above average. The thick cut fries were terrible - really mushy on the inside. The burger was completely tasteless but the condiments were fresh and made it okay. The bun was sensational - fresh and delicious. Maybe I should have just ordered bun bread and a shake."}
{"text":"Burgers are good, large portions. There's not really \"wait\" staff because you order & pick up at the counter.  Only downfall, it's on the other side of town. And the one that's on our side is in a food court in the Orleans"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. Great service. Never a bad meal! Plus the produce bar allows you make a little salad."}
{"text":"Yum! Whenever we are in the mood for good burgers, Fuddruckers it is!  Good food and good price. The place is clean and the staff is friendly.  Food comes out hot and fresh.  Getting hungry just writing this review!"}
{"text":"When you crave some goooood juicy red meat burgers, go to Fudd's!  I always enjoyed this chain when traveling to Arz, Cali & Colorado.  Now we have it in Vegas.  

Cooked to your standards and the toppings at the self-serve bar are the freshest.  Save room for cookies because they are fantastic also!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd give the \"100% USDA premium choice beef\" ribeye steak sandwich a try. 

When I saw the steak wasn't sliced but served whole on a bun I wondered how was I supposed to eat it. I took one bite and immediately knew the answer: it had been hammer tenderized to death, destroying all the natural fiber. The meat was mealy and just fell apart ... not cool.

I had a small order of sweet potato fries that tested like potato pie, not like fries. I'm pretty sure they used sweetener too. Not good either.

That was $11 for both, no soda. 

I remember in the '80s Fuddrucker was pretty expensive for a self service but they sold a superior product. Now it's just pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Disappointed 

I use to visit Fuddruckers often. However, I had not been to a Fuddruckers for years.  Today, after watching a movie at AMC Arrowhead, we decided to stop at Fuddruckers for a burger. 

This visit to Fuddruckers was disappointing to say the least. 
I wish I would have had my phone, so I could have taken a few  photos. The restaurant was partially full. We looked for a table but most of the empty tables were dirty as were the floors, windows, and condiment dispensers. I asked to have our table cleaned  and the staff member wiped it off with much of the table debris landing on our chairs, which we then cleaned ourselves. The staff member then walked up front to speak wuth a fellow work associate. It is hard to imagine, staff members passing by filthy tables, and make no attempt to clean the area.

We ordered bugers, fries, and onion rings. The onion rings were cold, my 1/3 pound burger was ordered medium well and it came out medium rare.  The produce at the \"serve yourself\" counter was fresh and that area was clean. The food was fair at best. We could have chosen a much cleaner restraunt with better food in that area. The serious lack of cleanliness was an issue for me. Management is clearly at fault.  I must say that all of the staff were friendly.  However, there is no excuse for the condition of this restaurant.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"I would say it's a typical burger place that allows you to order the burger the way you want and you do your own condiments. Family and I got the managers special for 6.99 which was a decent price. Fries were good but the burger looked small. The condiments were fresh and the coke machine was nice though automated. I would recommend this place for family"}
{"text":"I live and work right down the street from this burger spot . Not bad at all. You get to add all your favorite toppings at the condiment bar . They also have nacho cheese sauce for your fries and onion rings . They also have specialty burgers, shakes,onion rings, a kids  menu , and baked goods ."}
{"text":"Definitely miss having a Fuddruckers nearby. It's everything I remembered. Employees were super friendly. The food was great. Love the melted cheese and milkshakes. Gonna have to stop by when we are on that side of town again. A little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Kids love going here. I think it's alright but a better alternative to fast food. I do like their condiment section that you can put on whatever you like. Cookies are yummy."}
{"text":"Time and time again, Fuddruckers has never been on my bad list. There's nothing special here other than some memories I've shared at this place when I was little. I was sort of surprised that this place was still open, considering the fact that several restaurants around it has closed down.

This place is pretty simple setup, order on the right, condiment bar, and then tables everywhere. Nothing special, nothing to look at, just a place to sit down and eat. I do have to mention that it is sort of loud, but not to the point where you're shouting and such. This place is supposed to be a high quality type of burger, which no doubt it is, however to me I think I rather go to Five Guys for a nice big burger than come and sit down and wait around for a burger. 

Anyways, this place isn't bad nor is it amazing to the point where I'm a fan so I give it 3 stars for their service (for ordering), food, and their freshness of their condiments."}
{"text":"Lashiqa was our hostess and was so nice and friendly so good with kids which was nice as we were out if state visiting. So casinos for kids to eat isn't the best. Food was great anyone from out of state kids eat free on Mondays and Tues big help when you're loosing at the tables."}
{"text":"Good food. Very slow, though. Took almost 30 mins for fingers and fries. Don't come on your lunch hour. You won't have time to eat."}
{"text":"Always love this place when I'm craving a juicy burger. Food is reasonably priced but far above \"fast food\" quality. My first go to spot.x"}
{"text":"What can you say it's Fuddruckers as usual I am a huge fan of the fries that I dip in the jalapeño cheese sauce. I like that I get to dress my own burger.  Clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This location in particular had some of the nicest employees and management I have ever come across. The food is great  and quality consistent!"}
{"text":"So I went there at the beginning of this month with a friend...for the first time...yes believe it or not I had never been to fudd's.

It was OK...I mean not that big of deal it's a burger joint with a pick your own toppings bar...big deal...some of the nostalgia on the wall is cool.

The service was not that great..but the people that did come see us were at least friendly."}
{"text":"The place was not busy by any means when my husband and I arrived.  Yet we still waited over 20 minutes for our food.  The worst part?  They ran out of a lot of things we wanted to order, that should have been our first clue to leave.  The other thing I hate about this place is they are constantly vacuuming while there are guests in the dining room.  It's annoying and takes away from the dining experience.  

The place needs a lot of work and upkeep could be way better.  I didn't even want to sit in the booths because it looked so dirty.  

Unfortunately, we probably won't be coming back here.  It's definitely not like any other fuddruckers I've ever been to before."}
{"text":"Perfectly grilled, juicy burgers with a self-serve veggie bar. Make your burger a combo for an up charge (pricey) to include a drink (free refills) and fries or onion rings. Be sure to grab some ranch, ketchup, or jalapeño cheddar cheese to dip those fried goodies in too at the condiment bar. 

There is a huge selection of drinks at the soda fountain so add some flavor to a boring cola base (cherry? Yes please!). 

The shakes are thick and creamy and you're given the excess in a tin cup. Perfect amount to share with someone. 

Pick your own place to sit, but there is no need to clean up afterward because the friendly staff will bus the table when you leave."}
{"text":"I've been stopping by quite a bit lately for to go orders.  I'm addicted to their sweet potato fries! The staff is very friendly.  Matt is my favorite! So sweet and nice always makes me feel welcome! He even remembered that I can in asking for a veggie burger but they didn't have any so when I came in next he even said \"hey we have our veggie burgers now!\". I thought that was super thoughtful.  He's just a really nice guy, I'll for sure keep going back as long as they have sweet potato fries and Matt!! :)"}
{"text":"I like this place! It is not a 5 star burger place but it is a solid 4. They use good meet, and even though it is not totally original, they let you feel like you are in control of how it is cooked and you top it yourself.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is kind of a throw back, and they generally have some good music....although I did hear a Morrissey song, but I was able to block it out. Its not quite a 50 dinner theme but it is worth taking a look at.

I would for sure go for the 2/3 burger and from there the toppings are up to you."}
{"text":"This is a place you want to go where you want to spend some cash on a burger, but feel good doing it.

The portion sizes are HUGE!  The 1/3 Burger is plenty.  The fries are delicious.  I love the way the condiment stations are arranged.  It seems like NACHO cheese comes out of a dispenser for your burger and fries.

The only reason why this place isn't getting 5 stars is because it is always busy and that the food does take a while.  Be prepared to wait in line to get your order taken and then at least 10 minutes before the food comes out.  Bring some friends to keep you company. 

The people who take your order are very friendly and efficient.  This location seems pretty big, but it is always crowded."}
{"text":"I justed finished a BBQ Bacon Cheese Burger and I have to say it was fantastic. To be honest I usually go to the place with a Five in its name on holidays like today. But it costs $15 now for 1 person to eat. It's just not worth it. And today Fuddburger was so good I may never go to the other place ever again. The Fudd was always a great place to eat. And that hasn't changed. They're steak sandwiches are also excellent."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Fuddruckers in years and was pleasantly surprised by the game meats they offered.  I tried the buffalo, which was pretty tasty.  My qualm is really about the topping bar.  The tongs were laying INSIDE the trays of pickles, onions, relish, etc.  How gross to think that the patron before you was digging in the tomatoes for the tongs and then putting the tongs back inside the tray of tomatoes.  I didn't end up with very many toppings as a result.  Although it is the patrons' fault for being careless in placing the tongs back in the food, I think the restaurant should do a better job of monitoring and cleaning this up."}
{"text":"Our family, which includes three children with various food allergies, visited Fuddruckers for the first time today.  I was a bit concerned as there was no allergen information available online or via their app. I phoned ahead to inquire whether the hamburger buns contained egg and was informed by the kind young lady that answered that, while their white buns contain egg and sesame, the wheat buns contain neither.

When we arrived, the same woman that helped me on the phone greeted us. When she realized that I was the person who called with concerns about food allergies, she immediately offered to bring out the store's general manager, Kenneth, to answer any additional questions we had. We were never made to feel that we were a bother and Kenneth was thorough in ensuring that our family could dine safely (he even phoned the corporate office to verify ingredients).

The dining experience was awesome and everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed the food.  The custom burgers we had were cooked to order and were tasty and visually appealing.  The fresh topping bar had a variety of produce to choose from (pickles, peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, etc.).  The milkshakes we had (Oreo and strawberry) were a decadent and yummy treat that my kids loved.  I appreciated the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine to mix up my favorite soft drink flavors as well.  The restaurant was clean and well-stocked with condiments and napkins.

We will definitely be returning to this restaurant not just for the food but especially because of the genuine kindness and customer service shown to us by Kenneth and his staff.  He personally checked on us throughout our time there and followed up before we left to make sure we didn't have any issues and that we had a good experience.  If you are looking for a family-friendly restaurant with great food and even better customer service, please check out this Fuddruckers location.  Thank you, Kenneth!"}
{"text":"The decor is typical corporate-try-to-have-local-flair with Las Vegas themed posters of the Rat Pack and Bugsy Siegal and whatnot. 

It is fun that you can choose the size of your burger and that they offer some exotic meats. The open bar for burger toppings also makes the Fuddrucker experience a little bit different from your typical burger joint. The burgers themselves are greasy, but I have to say quite tasty! Unfortunately, that's really the best I can come up with. I have now gone through the \"Fuddrucker experience\" a couple of times and tried a few variations, but this time I decided it just isn't good enough when there are so many other options out there.

The buns are not note-worthy in any way, and the same can be said of the swiss or cheddar cheese if you choose these as additional toppings. But at least these are not bad toppings, which cannot be said for the blue cheese or grilled onion toppings. They add something to the blue cheese (I imagine to save on cost), but it makes it look & taste grainy. And those grilled onions (sometimes called caramelized onions) are, well, not grilled. When you grill an onion, the sugars caramelized and give it a wonderful sweetness that makes them special, and these are tasteless. I suspect they boil the onions, and then just mix them with some grease.

We have tried every side dish, and except for the mozzarella sticks, they are soggy & greasy & gross. And now they have gotten rid of the mozzarella sticks. If you must order a side dish, ask for it extra crispy, which will help a lot. But even then, when you eat the onion rings it will feel more like you are just eating fried batter more than anything else.

I have always found the restaurant clean, and the staff very nice. But it's a restaurant, and the reason you go is for the food. Or, in this case, the reason you don't go.

Finding it: It is in the same shopping center area as Target, on the south side of Flamingo. Look for the traffic light closest to Target, head south, and you will see Fuddrucker's almost in front of you, toward the right."}
{"text":"This place is located inside the Orleans casino.  Its part of their food court. Small compared to the normal Fuddruckers layout but the food is still the same.  The quality varies based on crew working at the time.  Burgers are their specialty and they make a good sandwich. Hungry? You can have a quarter, half or three quarter pound burger.  That's a lot of beef.  Cooked to order.  At Fuddruckers you add your own lettuce, tomatoes, onions and other toppings.  That area is with all the goodies is really small here.  Downside is their expensive menu. Burger, fries and shake will set you back a pretty penny.  Seating is limited but when its crowded you can always go sit down in front of the pizza, ice cream or sandwich shop.

The burgers are tasty.  The shakes are delicious.  And the fries are fat."}
{"text":"Cashier was not very friendly or helpful. Ordering there is a bit different than other places, therefore it would've been nice if she explained how it works, since it was our first time. But burger was delicious and you get to choose type of cheese and have unlimited access to condiments and sauces. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Fuddruckers is great! This is a serious burger. Although I usually go to the one on Flamingo, which is a real sit-down restaurant, this one servers its purpose when the late night burger pangs come on. It's in a food court at the Orleans but same quality burger that I have come to expect. They do skimp on the onion rings though so if you get the burger combo be ready to receive like only 8 rings total... not cool in my opinion but the burger makes up for it."}
{"text":"Best burger joint, hands down. I've eaten here many times and was so happy to find out that finally a Fuddruckers was in town having eaten at so many back on the East Coast. This is real food, it fills you completely. You have a topping bar where you can decide what you want to put on your burger. The chicken sandwiches are also great. Very tender and juicy meat. 

If you are looking for a burger joint look no further then Fuddruckers."}
{"text":"I miss you Fuddruckers! Will see you next time I am in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Could've been a really good burger, if it wasn't for the bottle of salt they put on my burger, almost felt like it was on purpose since there was no one in the restaurant and they seemed upset when we walked in. First and last time I set foot in that place but I did enjoy my beer."}
{"text":"Love this Fuddruckers location. We eat here all the time. Sign up for the email list for BOGO offers weekly. Food is served quickly, prices are reasonable, and it's easy to get in and park and just as easy to get back out. 

Great burgers, great fries, great salads, great onion rings. Can't stand the fish (too greasy) but if you stick to the items listed above, you can't go wrong with the home made buns and meet patty's.

We eat here at least twice a month and it's always a great experience. The worst part of eating here is sometimes the employees go a long time before wiping down abandoned tables. We've seen 15 tables and booths with dirty plates just vacated and ignored, which limited where we could sit that day. That's really my only complaint and that is really minor and doesn't happen very often.

I'm getting hungry just writing this review!"}
{"text":"Great concept though poorly executed, service was slow and borderline indifferent, fries served were old and when asked for fresh the response was not so service like.
OK for a quick visit though next time I'll go to Red Robin."}
{"text":"This has always been a family fave of mine! So many choices on burgers and great garlic bread and seasoned fries! Love the vibe and feel of the interior design! Lots of famous pictures of old stars and legends!"}
{"text":"Monday nights kids meals are 99 cent with an adult meal. Great deal. 
Haven't dined at a Fuddruckers in 15+ years and it was great. Food was hot and fresh and staff were friendly. 

From the outside it's quite dark and we questioned if they were even open. The lights at the front door weren't working, which was kind of odd and unwelcoming.

Love the topping bar to dress your sandwich with whatever you would like.  Self serve fancy Coke machine, many TVs to watch sports on, arcade machines for the kids.

Whats not to like?  Deducted 1 star due to the outside lighting at front door.  Otherwise will be back."}
{"text":"Burger was good, but this place was having issues today. Out of ketchup for 20 minutes during lunch rush. Manager brought out spoiled ketchup packets as a stopgap measure. One of the two soda stations down resulting in long wait for a drink. Childs hot dog was overdone to a shriveled mess."}
{"text":"I enjoy Fudd. I like the fact that you can order your burger Med Rare and it comes that way. 

I like fat fries and free cheese sauce to dip it in. Infact i used cheese, jalapeno cheese, bbq, and honey mustard to dip  the wedge shaped fries. 

I like that you can pick the produce you want. If you like diced versus sliced tomatoes or lettuce. You can add too much mayo and clog your arteries more. It is up to you. 

The service was good, it was early. The burger was great, just lacked a little seasoning, but i can add that myself. 

I like that it is a sit down type place but is also a get it your damn self place. 

I like FUDD."}
{"text":"Pros... Quick, good, cooked right, self serve condiments, friendly staff. Good choice of size and type of meat. fresh buns, self serve drinks. Good Good Good.

Cons... The place is a little run down, they sometimes no self serve trash bins."}
{"text":"came out with a happy stomach and super full, (that's for the 1/3 lb burger) LOL Awesome staff, manager asks around tables how your dining experience is, the selection of items for the burgers are FRESH AND plenty, of course the have the new Free-Style Coca Cola machines, good beer selections as well. Xavier (manager) is very friendly. Really clean and open area space to hang out and relax with a beer and SUPER MOIST DELICIOUS BURGER on the side. They have renovated the restaurant and it has been a thumbs up for my husband and I. Will be back many times, keep it up!  Restaurant is huge for parties too. Great access to this location as it is right at the I-17 exit. Free WiFi..."}
{"text":"I haven't had Fuddruckers in years, not since I lived on the east coast. I got an e-mail from uber that said \"Hey, $10 off your first order!\" so I said why not. It's a lazy Sunday and I don't feel like leaving the house. They had Fuddruckers listed and I got excited. I ordered a Bourbon burger, requested to replace the bleu cheese with cheddar cheese because bleu cheese makes me sick and got a side of fries with ranch on the side for the fries. Plus, why not, added on a regular Oreo milkshake. The order arrived, there was no bun and there was bleu cheese, plus a side box with pickles and tomatoes and lettuce and onions that I did not ask for that went directly into the trash. It's not Fuddruckers fault the fries were cold but there was no side of ranch. The child size small milkshake is the worst I've ever had in my life. Like diluted water with some oreo crumbled in. Sure I placed my order through ubereats but it's not their fault if the restaurant screwed up the order (which I checked and verified that it was placed correctly, yes there it says white bun no bleu cheese, side o ranch), to the point it all went in the trash.

And I just want to say as an enthusiast bacon lover, it broke my heart to not be able to salvage the bacon from the bleu cheese."}
{"text":"Love the this burger joint. Ambiance has an oldie but goodie feel to it. All burgers are made so you can see. Everything is done fresh and you can dress your burger how you like with the buffet style condiments. Serve the burgers in 3 different sizes. Price was good for the quality burger. Definitely a family spot. Seemed like all the ppl in the place was with family members."}
{"text":"I come to this Fuddruckers regularly since I usually have other business to tend to in this area.  For the most part place is clean (not sure why so many people complain about the cleanliness). The staff is friendly and usually the person cleaning the dining room will come by your table and ask if you need anything else.

The burgers are very good in my opinion and I love the fixing's bar. The bar is always stocked with lots of veggies that are fresh.

This place is a bit pricey but I'm willing to pay for a good burger. 

This is one of those places I will keep coming back to because they do have some of the best burgers in town!"}
{"text":"I'm going to follow Tracy M. from Chicago and say that what used to be my absolute favorite, high quality hamburger in the world, a Fudd, is no longer....not by a long shot. 
Attention manager, store owner, and district franchise overlords: This Fuddruckers located on 78th Ave. and Bell Road is really going downhill fast. Our last two visits [evening, midweek] were truly our last two visits. We're done. No more chances Fuddruckers Management. Your restaurant was abysmally disappointing in...where do I start? 
1) Out of food for everything we tried to order! What kind of dumb purchasing manager doesn't buy enough food to see his/her resturant through to closing time? 
2) Place was dirty, dirty, dirty. I mean sticky floors, goo dribbling around the catsup dispeners & every table in the joint needed bussing. I couldn't seem to find a buss-er anywhere around (hubby suggested they were all out back smoking a joint, and by the looks of the place he was probably right) I had to wet napkins at the fountain and clean a table myself before we could sit down.  
3) Hmmm, price has gone up like everything else, and the meat still seemed like quality beef, but did ya have to shrink the size of the burgers? 
4) Out of condiments, just a few lonely fresh veggies left at the salad bar. 
5) As we were eating, the teenage help was doing night cleanup around us (while ignoring the 30 or so un-bussed tables catching flies) And no, it was not nearly closing time. 
6) A milkshake that was just that: Shaken milk, no ice cream. It was pathetic! How do you not have staff that can make a milkshake at a burger joint?? Wouldn't that be lesson #2 right after 'Always wash your hands after you visit the bathroom'. 
If you are one of those diners who like to be in a nice place that makes you feel welcome, where you feel valued, that is CLEAN and well run by workers that care about their job, where you can get a quality sandwich for the dollars spent - Don't go to Fuddruckers on west Bell Road."}
{"text":"We came back to Fuddruckers after a long time, but we should have returned sooner! I had forgotten what a good value they provide. I had a Bourbon Chicken sandwich, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Restaurant name: Fuddruckers

Judging Criteria:

First appearance: Beautifully seared and openly displayed. The lightly charred bits look delicious. Odd thing to note however, the sesame seed bun has so few seeds it can be hidden under my thumb. The bottom bun was also very, very soggy though which is a shame.

Flavor:  Mouth watering. The burger was perfectly cooked (medium rare). The buns flavor perfectly compliments the beef patty. I thought about eating it with no toppings at all it was that good. 

Meat to bun ratio: Perfectly proportioned for the size of the bun. Nothing overhangs. Burger was finished all together. 

Included extras (veggies / condiments): American cheese. All toppings included in price (outside of the premier toppings like bacon or an egg). Topping will not be included in this review. However, after initial tasting, I added lettuce, tomato, dill pickle, white onion and mustard. 

Price: $6.49 (half pound)

Grade: B = Really good. The burger has good flavor but might have a flaw or two.

{"text":"Had to knock off some stars after our latest visit.  Things seem to have gone downhill since our last time here.  Right when we walked in the door we were hit with a foul smell, like rotten meat.  That was off-putting to say the least, and we nearly turned right around to leave, but my kid really wanted to eat there, so we went in.  The smell lessened somewhat but throughout our meal it came and went, which really made me regret staying.  Whoever was busing that day was not doing a great job.  \"Cleared\" tables were not wiped down, and chairs were left with crumbs and food litter.  The booth my kids chose had lettuce on the seats and crumpled paper towels in the corner.  When our food was ready, we went to the topping bar and saw that it was in a sorry state, not replenished, and also had a weird off smell.  The tomatoes looked old.  I steered clear of most of it, when I normally pile it on.  Over at the sauce/condiment counter, the dispensers looked old and nasty.  One of the push levers for the mayonnaise was broken inward.  The labels for the sauces were deteriorating and almost illegible.  I was shocked that they didn't have any regular mustard, until I finally noticed it was there, only the label sticker was completely faded.  On the other side of the condiment table, the counter was filthy with streaks of dried sauce.  The jalapeno cheese sauce had dried cheese on the spout and was super thick and hard to push out.  I abandoned that and got the regular cheese.  I also got some ranch, and frankly, the ranch tasted off that day too.  All of these negatives just left me with an overall sad feeling about the state of the place.  I really hope this was a one time thing or that things improve soon.

On a positive note, the food was perfectly cooked and great-tasting.

tldr:  It smelled like rotten meat.  Topping bar wasn't as fresh.  Sauce table was dirty.  Seats and tables were not wiped down.  Food was good, but that smell was too much.  Sad trombone."}
{"text":"The GOOD: Hot, 2/3rd pound burgers with terrific Flavor/Seasoning. 
The BAD: DRY as a convenience store microwave burger from the refrigerator case.  I'm not exaggerating one iota. They were like granulated cardboard. 
The PROGNOSIS: I'll be sticking with Stuart's angus place. Sorry."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. Much better than Cheeseburger in Paradise. Ordering food is easy and simplistic. It comes out hot and fresh, they offer a condiment bar to put the typical veggies on. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I grew up in Washington State eating at a place called Flakey Jakes, which closed down, which started the  mourning of the loss of the infamous cheese pump. The closure of flakey Jakes was most upsetting to my high school bestie Shelly. That cheese pump managed to solve all the days, issues and then some. 
Went to Fudruckers with the SBL( sexy bearded lover) and realized that this place is Flakey Jakes twin separated at birth. What a reunion it was...To be side by side with our friend the cheese pump once again. 
Wile there, I thought why not be different and get the fish and chips (substituted with sweet potato fries) and the SBL ordered the third pounder burger and regular fries. SBL was so happy with his burger I was jealous. He and the cheese pump had instantly hit it off. However my fish looked nothing like the picture they were pimpin' which was the reason I ordered it to begin with. It was greasy and triangular, and so not bueno. Was I foolish thinking fish from a place called Fudruckers would be the 
bees-nees? Was I expecting too much based off that picture of fish? These are not things that keep me up at night, thankfully, but rather are chalked up to notes to self. I have a lot of those. In the end, my overall recommendation is to stick with the burgers because that's what they do best. Their place is fun and whackadooddle inside and they have those awesome Coke machines you can pick from a zillion flavors. That kinda made up for my fish, ok not really, but at least I wasn't thirsty on top of being disappointed...and End Scene."}
{"text":"Fudd's is a solid burger establishment.  I got creative and decided to try the elk burger... very tasty and filled with lean protein.  The kids were very happy with their meals and they even came with a cookie.  The best part may be the unlimited toppings bar that is clean, fresh and even includes items such as pickles and nacho cheese.  I have always considered Fudd's a great value for the quality of food and the atmosphere is fun with lots of sports on television and a small arcade for the kids."}
{"text":"I don't really like eating at the food court in Arrowhead Mall. Luckily, this place is right next to the mall. They have great burgers! It's a little different than In & Out, but comparably tasty. My all time favorite is The Hangover Burger. I love the way the egg melts over the bacon when you bite into the burger. It's seriously worth the 774 calories! I like my burger medium. I also add on potato wedges because they're spot on delicious. My boyfriend enjoys trying the exotic burgers from the menu. His favorite is the Kobe Burger. 

For your burgers, you can either get a small (1/3 lb) or large (1/2 lb). They have a topping bar where you can add lettuce, tomatoes, onions, condiments, etc. This place is the perfect place to bring your kids. There's plenty of space for them to roam around. They even have a little game shack for the kids."}
{"text":"Have always been a fan of The Fudd and their great burgers and fries, but I am a little concerned about their future.

The food is and has always been wonderful. They have a variety of meats and burger choices. The burgers have always been cooked to perfection. The steak fries always have great seasoning applied. The shakes are always yummy. The best part of the meal though are the condiment options.  The self serve condiment bar is loaded with vegetables and the sauce options are many. Their signature cheese sauce is their staple and I have never seen any burger joint match it. If you are grading only grub this place is always five stars in my book.

My issue and concern probably rests with management. For some reason cleanliness has become a real issue. The condiment bar is always a little disheveled and sauce stand a mess. Someone really needs to keep closer eye on it given how popular it is. The restaurant as a whole just lacks the attention it needs to stay in tip top shape.

My family and I love The Fudd but I fear if they do not keep a tighter ship this staple is going to lose its muster. Again, the food here has always been amazing and hope the rest of the establishment can catch up. Today, just 3.5 stars :("}
{"text":"Food- amazing. Customer service kind of sucks. MISTY is so rude and she ignored my boyfriend and I, until the manager (I assume) said something to us. She kept laughing at the register as she's taking our order and she couldn't even look us in the eyes."}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness!!!!   Can't believe this company closed in Colorado!   Fuddruckers how I long for your burgers!  So, here I am the second day in a row for lunch. Please come back to Denver!!!!

Your burgers are perfectly grilled for my tastebuds and bottomless drinks don't hurt, either!"}
{"text":"Fuddruckers has been on my radar for years, and I finally made the trekk to satisfy a craving for a buffalo burger. 

Select from their menu of specialty burgers or build your own by choosing your meat option and adding whatever premium toppings  that you desire for $1 each. It's easy to create a burger costing nearly $20, but  I couldn't skip out on adding grilled mushrooms, a fried egg, and grilled onions -- whatever, first time there so I lived a little. Basic toppings can be found at the buffet located near the assortment of condiments. I passed on the greenery after noticing that the lettuce tongs were contaminated with pieces of onion and tomato. 

My 1/2 pound buffalo burger was just OK. The blue cheese wasn't the best choice -- my bad. The patty was good, so it didn't disappoint. I was surprised to find out that the fried egg was fully cooked. There's no point in adding an egg if it's not going to be runny - What. The. FUDD.  At least the burger was filling. 

Service was decent, and each table is assigned a server who cleans up your table and serves you beverages. 

The restaurant could use some tidying. I noticed trash on the floors near the soda fountain machine, as well as partially-filled beverages that appeared to have been forgotten. 

Reviews and praises about this place set me up for having high expectations, but I walked out not impressed. I felt like the price we paid for our meals, nearly $40, was on par with specialty burger restaurants around town that have tastier offerings."}
{"text":"Was in town for Wrestlemania 26 and was looking for somewhere to watch Michigan St. play in the NCAA tournament, boy did we choose the wrong place... Order took forever, sat down, they mixed the wife and mines burger temperatures up! Sooooo, we had to wait some more! I ended up filling up on fries and pickles! In there defense they knew they messed up and treated our party of 10 to free desserts, which were really, really good! Kids had fun, some kid kept winning stuffed animals out of the claw game and gave them to my boys!"}
{"text":"Customer service is the worst. Ordered burger well done. After a10 minute wait, got a medium rare burger. Took it back and they said they would make another. They tore a hunk off it and proclaimed it well done. The edge may have been done but the center was medium and still pink on the inside. After nearly 20 minutes still no lunch and its clear the manager nor anyone else knows how to cook a burger. I now understand why 2 weeks before a customer was screaming at these idiots about their TOTAL LACK of concern for customers issues. No sign of a temperature probe to measure internal temperature. We are just supposed to eat the raw crap they serve? I think not. The senior crowd that fills the seats are too blind to see what raw food they are served. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I came here during a work training group right when they opened. The food took a little long to come out, but it wasn't a bad thing... I didn't really want to go back to work so I welcomed the wait. It was well worth it because my 2/3 burger was cooked to medium well perfection!! 

 The soda machine did have a lot of flavors and most of the diet was out. 

 I loved the customer service though!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, but expensive for a place where you get your food at the counter. Without a coupon you could easily run up a bill the same as at Red Robin, which at least has waitstaff and refills on fries. 
The burgers were a bit on the oily/greasy side and they sat really heavy, but they tasted good. The toppings are fresh and fun- I love that they have malt vinegar out for the taking. Overall, this is pretty decent but not fantastic."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Portions large enough to share. Fresh. Quick service. Made to order"}
{"text":"Worst thing on the menu is the milkshakes. They are made with a mix that tasted very grainy & quite honestly, disgusting. When we inquired about it we weren't even offered a refund.
Best thing is the free warm cheese sauce & the fresh vegetables you can add to your burger or chicken sandwich. 
The buns are fresh baked so it is one of the few places my husband can get a burger at because he is allergic to an ingredient on most store bought bread so we do enjoy it once in a while. 
They have a self serve Coke machine (the ones that look like an ATM where you press the screen to choose your soda) & it is a big enough place to take a large group of people & sit together comfortably. 
They used to have a family meal for $20 but they discontinued it so we don't go as often as we used to. I guess all good things must come to an end."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE this place. They are fast to get your order and make it how you want it. There hamburgers and deserts are soooo good that it's so hard to stop eating. All of there produce is always fresh. I like how they walk by to see if anyone ever needs anything else like ketchup or mayo or take things that your done with to make room at the table. They are always clean and the bathrooms are always cleaned and checked on every so often."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy the Fuddruckers in Brookfield so I thought I would try this one.  Sigh.
I have been twice but won't be back.  Dry, dry, dry burgers, turkey & beef both times.  I got the burgers to go and the condiments pack had lettuce, tomato, onion (yuck), ketchup packs, mustard packs, & mayonnaise packs all in the same ziplock bag.  How clean is that?  Can you say cross contamination?"}
{"text":"My man loves this place. So I gave it a try 3 times and just didn't like it. 
I can't help it i am being honest and do not see the hype at all. I heard all this good stuff about the taco salad so I tried that the first time. The ground beef was cold and had no flavor at all! I couldn't even eat the whole thing.
Next time i tried the chicken sandwich and it was so greasy and had no flavor either. 
The 3rd time I just simply ordered fries not wanting to waste my money on cold flavorless grease and they just weren't up to par.
I told him he has to go by himself from now on I will go to In-N-Out and leave this place to its faithful followers instead!"}
{"text":"I don't get why its in a food court at the Orleans, but it has amazing burgers for great prices. Its open 24 hours a day, I have gone for lunch, dinner, and at 3am, the food is constantly good and quick service. The Mushroom Swiss burger is good and I love the onion rings."}
{"text":"Down from upstate NY for the weekend and stopped here with the family tonight.  We were the last order of the night and they were so nice to us, and the food was great!  Another solid meal from a great place!

By the way we brought the rest of the family here the following day for luunch too!!!!  Couldn't resist when they offered."}
{"text":"Got a deal two double burgers, two fries and two drinks for $11.99. WOW what a deal. Our party of 12 loved it. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"They must have changed their menu from 3 years ago...but changed for the worse...

We ordered:
Kobe Burger-This was good.  But I can't taste the difference between this one and the regular quarter pounder, but of course it costs more.

Elk Burger-could definitely taste the difference in this burger, BUT, not in a good way.  Kinda gamey...took one bite and place it back on the tray.  

Wedge fries-they were just soft and soggy.  I remembered it being nice and crisp on the outside, and light and tender in the middle...not like this.

Oreos Cookie Shake-there were big chunks of oreos in my shake, and the shake isn't thick and creamy like how I remembered it either.

I don't know...could it be that I just had sliders from Slidin' Thru days prior?  Could it be that I didn't care for burgers that day?  Maybe because my memories of Fuddruckers was that it is a freakin' awesome burger joint and had high hopes and it just didn't meet my expectation?  Well, whatever the cause was, the effect is that I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Instead of going to the one on Grand Canyon, we decided to go to the one in the Orleans!  OMG, there was so many people at this food court period!  It was so hard to find a seat!  I was almost ready just to cancel my order!  The girl that was at the register also seemed to be a bit irritated!  It showed!  So we finally found a seat.  As we sat next to all the loud cheerleaders that were there!  I don't like this location, because everything is so compact.  There topping bar, if there's 2 people in the area it's too many people in that area!    So once we got our burgers, we had to go 1 at a time to get our fixings, because someone might get our table.   But once we were able to dig in, OMG, this burger was so good!  I got the California burger!  Sorry, with all the people here, I totally forgot to take a pic!   Next time I think we will go to the other location.   It's just too many people here! I just can't do this location!  Unless I'm just here already!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long time...I think this is now my favorite burger place!  I love a place where I can put my one toppings on it, and if there's jalapeno's and peppers, I'm in hog heaven.   The 1/3 burger is enough to wobble out of there, and I love there onion rings better than the fries.    Fuddruckers, you will be seeing me more!"}
{"text":"I love the burgers here. .. however I wanted dessert. . And well they took down the shake machine already and no desserts were displayed in the case either.  Please fix this as we arrived at 9.... you closed at 10..."}
{"text":"Always go here for a late night burger. Would recommend the elk for anyone who wants a high protein low guilt treat!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad service. Cashier couldn't tell us about the sandwiches. As per usual they were out of their \"exclusive\" cream sodas. Couldn't tell me when they would have it in again. Condiment table was pretty dirty and the toppings looked pretty sad  wilted lettuce and whatnot. The kids macaroni was congealed and was obviously sitting for hours without being stirred or anything. I get it you're not going to make a fresh pot of mac n cheese for my kid but he doesn't want crusty poor quality microwaved macaroni. Overall a bad experience, but at least my chicken sandwich tasted fine"}
{"text":"As a 34 year old who had never been to Fuddruckers once in my life, I was pleasantly surprised at the patience of the cashier as I explored every line of every menu. 
   I ordered the bourbon burger combo, which was a half pound burger, and fries for the side. The fries were flavored, but subtle. I dipped them in hot cheese sauce, one of many options available at the build-your-own-burger bar. HOT LIQUID CHEESE SAUCE- FREE!!! Good luck finding that at any other burger joint! In fact, many don't have it, even for a price!
   My brother and I went late on a recent Sunday night. For awhile, we were the only customers there. We met to discuss some recent  trauma I experienced and the staff was very respectful of our privacy. They came by a couple times to check on us. 
   The coke machine with hundreds of combinations is not new. It's becoming more common in restaurants where you get your own drinks. What made FUDs special? STRAWBERRY CREAM SODA!!!  Nostalgic, delicious and unavailable anywhere I've ever seen!
   Although we did not utilize any of it, they do have various video games, claw machines, and a couple machines where you put in a quarter or 2 and get some cheap prize in a plastic egg. I may have missed or forgotten something, but they are not short on entertainment for the little ones. And lots of TVs too! They had football playing the night we went, which would have been my focus, if not for a more important conversation taking place. 
   Not only do I highly recommend Fuddruckers, I'll be going back there again myself!!! Great food, great service... Almost forgot- If you dine in and get beverage, they give you a plastic cup like one you would get at sit-down restaurant. You leave it, they wash/reuse it. Although I didn't see it advertised anywhere, if you ask, they will provide a Styrofoam cup you can fill for your drive home- or walk to work, or bus ride to airport, or cab ride to the dentist, or however you get wherever you go!!!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been to this place in years. Still delicious. Service counter people can be a little more customer service savvy. But you can't beat the amount of toppings you can choose to get. Perfect for pickle lovers of the family."}
{"text":"Always good food and service ... these folks are always friendly and helpful ... the manager was even helping with the tables"}
{"text":"When was the last time you had breakfast at Fuddruckers?  This is a location licensed by the Orleans and it is one of two places in the food court that is open 24 hours.  As such it has some menu modifications for breakfast.  I was looking for a light breakfast and figured for $6.99 for the breakfast burger I wouldn't get too stuffed.  I was wrong, 1/3lb beef patty with an egg, bacon, cheese served with a mound of potatoes I was stuffed.  If I was hungover this would have been the perfect breakfast and as it was I liked it."}
{"text":"My son  Brandon went with us as a family a year ago to Fuddruckers. He had asked for cheese on his burger and did not receive it we went back to ask for it he overheard two of the girls talking about him as if they were so put out like it was such a big deal. He was only twenty-two at the time and he asked  to speak a manager I raise my children to be very respectful so he talked to the manager in a very professional manner and explained the situation as it made him feel uncomfortable as if it was such a big deal that they forgotten the cheese. Actually I offered to pay for it. Most recently he went back to Fuddruckers to use the gift card then the manager provided him unfortunately he had waited so long and it expired which was fine. When he got his food there was a red hair on his Burger, he went up to the manager to explain that there is a red hair on his Burger the manager is like no one here has red hair. Has Brandon looked behind him and the girl with dyed red hair was standing behind him and explain to him what about the girl behind you the manager is like look we'll go ahead and cook your burger. Brandon was like kind of put out by the fact that he was so rude and taken aback by it. Brandon will never eat there again. It sounds me greatly because Brandons been going there since he was four years old."}
{"text":"OHHHHHH MY GOD......

I think the last two years I've come to The Orleans I've paid Fuddrucker's a visit... next year will definitely be the 3rd... and probably 5th and 6th, because their crispy chicken sandwich is flipping orgasmic!

Perfectly cooked. Juicy and tender on the inside. Crispy and golden on the outside. It was seriously perfection. And the worker that helped us was SO nice! The only downside is I recall they always take a while for your order. In a group of about 5 of us, I think we were there for over 20 minutes waiting for everyone's order to take with us back to our hotel room, but it was so worth it.

I only just now realized that Fuddrucker's exists here in California, too. I seriously thought it was like a Vegas exclusive or something... too bad the closest one is all the way in Union City... PLEASEEEEEEE someone open one here in San Jose!!!"}
{"text":"Ok these are burgers. We had 7 at our table and they were all overdone aka dry.  Someone squeezed the life out of mine.  The toppings were fantastic.  The room was full and my wheelchair wouldn't fit between tables.  Several tables were dirty and the dining room was a mess.  We cleaned our own table. If the toppings were not so perfect they would be getting one star."}
{"text":"After 12 years my office has moved, so checking out the new area and finding new lunch time eats, and what a lucky duck I am, I am now in the midst of a foodie heaven, so much to choose from.  Coworkers and I were craving a burger and thought well Fuddruckers is right up the street so let's give it try.

Headed over their high noon on a Friday, got in right away, placed our order and got our food and was back in the office in 45 mins!

The burger was just right, I ordered a 1/3 pound cheeseburger with French fries, it was cooked to perfection, loaded it with my favorite toppings.  

Great to add this place to my lunch time eats, when I'm craving a beefy burger I will be back!"}
{"text":"Their burger buns used to be buttery. But lately, not so much anymore! Despite this, their burgers are still good.

Price: Burgers average to about $7+, fries start from $2.50. So, it'll cost about $12 for a complete meal

Serving Size: Portion is quite large for their burgers, but I could use a bit more fries.

Other Pros: Their cheese sauce is AWESOME!!!! They have a self serve dispenser for it. Add it to your fries or burger & you'll have an awesome meal!

It also pretty cool they have a station with the lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, etc., that you can customize to add to your burger."}
{"text":"I ordered a hamburger combo with fries onion rings and a drink. 3rd pound burger came was cooked medium fries were Chris and the onion rings the batter was very good. I also enjoy how they let you decide what items to put on top."}
{"text":"Fuddruckers is one of those places that I've always said I really enjoy, although I haven't been in years. I remember it being very good, but after my visit today, I'm not sure where I got that idea from.  The one thing I am sure of is that I won't be coming back to this location if I ever eat at a Fuddruckers again.

I'll start with what I did like...

The burger toppings bar was well stocked and all the veggies looked crisp and colorful. The lettuce was bright green, the tomatoes red... It was like a little farmer's market in there. Impressive!

And like all Fuddruckers, they had the hot jalapeño nacho cheese pump set up and operational, which is always good.

Everything else about my experience was terrible, however.  

I ordered a hangover burger (patty, fried egg, American cheese, bacon) cooked to medium. It was well done...dead, grey meat. If there was any seasoning, I didn't taste it. It seemed as though they took one slice of bacon and broke it into three equal-sized pieces instead of giving an adequate amount of bacon to constitute the extra money. The egg was fried hard. Kind of a bummer since I like a little yolk, but they didn't ask how I like my eggs and I didn't tell them, so I guess I really can't complain about that much. Maybe the cooks are trained to cook out the yolk to prevent mess. Overall, the burger was mediocre, bland, over cooked... Not at all like I remember the food here.

I remember enjoying their wedge cut fries.. Maybe I should have stuck to what I know. I ordered chili cheese fries because it sounded awesome. What I got was cold fries covered in lukewarm chili topped with cheese that was maybe half-melted. It was soggy and hard to finish.

My wife got the southwest burger. It was also burnt, but not a problem since it was ordered well-done. The guacamole, however, was sour tasting in her opinion so she didn't finish her food either.

To make the experience worse, there was an obnoxious customer sitting two tables over from us who felt it necessary to belch loudly throughout his meal. It was disgusting to say the least.  I know this isn't fuddrucker's fault, but it didn't help the situation any.

I was excited about stopping here for lunch. It's a fun concept for a burger place where you get to load your burger with as many of your favorite toppings as you want. Unfortunately, this location killed any positive memories I might have had of this establishment, and with so many great places to eat in town, I doubt I'll ever try it again."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place all of the time and I always loved it. Consistently great food and service. I moved across town and had to find new neighborhood favorites. Well, today I was craving a hot dog and only one place would do. I needed a buttery toasted bun and all the toppings I could handle. I made the drive and instantly I was home again. Some new faces, but just as friendly as always. A slightly tweaked menu, but my hotdog was still there waiting for me. I was not disappointed. As a matter of fact, I was pleasantly surprised to find that by checking in, I was getting my freshly baked chocolate chip cookie for free! 
Thanks for keeping things consistent Fuddruckers! I promise not to stay away so long next time."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers!!!  I got the triple cheese burger (I love my cheese).  Well done of course.  My dad and Uncle tried the buffalo and kobe burgers.  My mom stuck with a regular cheese burger.  They loved the fresh ingredients bar.  And then they discovered the melted cheese....  They loved it for their fries.    We had a great time sitting in a round table so we can enjoy each other company and communicate."}
{"text":"Good juicy burgers and great buns.  I always get the 1/4 bacon cheese burger and fries!  And then the limitless topping bar.  To add to make all better....the melt-y hot cheese.....  YUM!!!!  

Love their new soda machines...  Pick your drinks and selections..."}
{"text":"I always heard about this place and was curious to try it.  Well it just so happened that one night when I made the rare trip to the southwest part of the valley to pick up the jacket for my suit JCPenney was holding for me, I spotted Fuddruckers!  So the dinner choice was quite clear.

Once inside I wasn't sure if it was going for a fast food or restaurant ambiance.  Everything was set like a fast food place but then the prices (15 per person) and the seating area contrasted greatly.  Regardless the cashier recommended the buffalo burger based saying how much leaner it was and that the ostrich burger was currently out of season so we ordered that along with half onion rings, half fries.  

When we got our order I was excited to take a stab at the array of condiments and toppings for us.  I ordered grilled onions and pepper jack cheese on my burger as well so it wasn't toppingless to begin with but of course that didn't stop me.  Jalapeno cheese sauce on the fries?  Don't mind if I do!  Pico de gallo on my burger?  Perfect!  Mayonnaise?  Nope, I avoid that like the plague these days (as if the cheese wasn't fattening enough either).  

Once we sat down to finally eat and see if the price was worth it . . . like the suspense?  As if the rating didn't give it away . . . it was!  I ordered my burger medium-rare and every bite I could feel the juices flowing in my mouth and the cheese and grilled onions were the perfect compliment.  The fries and the onion rings were also huge and also delicious!  Whether with cheese, ketchup or Au natural those sides were crispy and full of flavor.  Overall I felt greatly satisfied.  I dare say, almost as much as In'N Out?  

I don't know how often I'll take a trip to that side of town in the future but when I do, I know one place I'll think about popping in at.  I just need to find out when ostrich meat is in season."}
{"text":"I used to eat here on the East Coast a long time ago. I moved to Las Vegas a while back and found this location and try to eat here at least once a week. They've got Fantastic Burgers and the french fries are outstanding. The staff is always super friendly and very welcoming. The best thing about eating here is they bake their bread fresh everyday! Can you believe that? Fresh bread at a restaurant? That's fantastic! Thanks for the great food and great service guys!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but she the customer service not so great. The cashier Lashieka was being rude, when I went to pay for my order, she tried to tell me that the chip for the card reader doesn't work but I couldn't hear her because she was so quiet, due to her not speaking up I was about to place my card in the chip reader than she raised her voice to tell me no. Now I understand that she had a difficult customer to deal with before me that was giving her attitude but that's how customer service is, you can't give a new customer who has done nothing wrong to you the same attitude that you were giving someone who was being difficult."}
{"text":"I haven't been to fuddruckers in over 5 years and to be honest I never remembered it being this bad.

First of all let me tell you about the customer service. Wow I informed the employee this the burger was \"too cold\" and she kinda had an atrium by rolling her eyes at me. It kinda tells me this happens all the time. I spoke to the manager about the Kobe burger and he just gave me a simple \"it's good\". I don't expect for him to give me a lecture but just tell me what kind of beef it was. 

Overall I wouldn't recommend coming back to fuddruckers at all. If this is what the company became to \"roll their eyes at you\" then forget about it."}
{"text":"Their basic hamberger $5, good portion, 
you can piled up tomatoes; lettuce; from the \"self help\" station.Great Value !
My family all agreed the flavor is better than In-&-Out.
You can also sign up for Fuddrucker Club online & get a free meal on your birthday."}
{"text":"Love to eat here on Mondays and Tuesdays. You get a free kids meal with a purchase of an adult entry. Everything is always fresh, lots of meat options."}
{"text":"We ate at this place on 1/8/2010 Friday afternoon, we ordered a Buffalo berger (meal) and a fish chip meal. Starting at 2-3 am Sat morning, we cannot stop vomiting till Sunday morning. We were there for CES show but ending up staying at the hotel room only. We were so sick we couldn't even get out of bed till Sunday Morning, then we went home.... We didn't make it to the CES..... :( 

They need to watch out how they handle the food...it is terrible....."}
{"text":"Stopped here after leaving a nearby business. Very very disappointing.  Chili fries was soggy and very greasy, hamburgers was tasteless. Really only thing good was the soda fountain, for the price is way to high for the poor quality of food. Will never come back"}
{"text":"Tastiest burgers in town. Nothing like the burgers here to feed an appetite. Very high quality meet, drinks, hamburger bar for toppings, TVs. Awesome deal."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here, especially when I do a no carb diet! I love the juicy burgers and you can order whatever size you like! They also have a bison, which I love! The milkshakes are out of this world and the other desserts are yummy too. The service isn't always the greatest but its not that bad to make me not want to come back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location has yet to get a single one of my orders right when I get it delivered. There's always at least two condiments missing and sometimes an entire burger or they sent the wrong burger. I gave it two stars though because the food is absolutely delicious! If they could just put a little extra effort into their delivery orders I would give them 5 stars but after 3 failed orders I had to dock 3 stars."}
{"text":"4 stars

Positives:
I always went here growing up so I love this place.  I love that you can assemble your own burger with all the toppings and condiments your little heart desires! I go straight for the cheese sauce.. nom nom nom.  I don't usually care for the thick cut fries but I make an acceptation for theirs with that tasty seasoning they use. The 1/3 or 1/2 lb burger is always good.  This time I got the burger with bacon and blue cheese and MAN was it yummy.  Only since I am on Yelp will I admit that I ate the entire thing. Yes fries and all. Then I complained all day how full I was. I may have even had part of my husband's burger if we are being honest. 

Negatives:
I don't really see any negatives here. Perhaps just order something that sounds like it has a lot of flavor vs a plain burger."}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale on business.  Wanted a burger so Yelp brought us here.   In short, the burger and fries were really good.  I asked for medium rare, and I received medium rare.  I like my burgers very plain as all I put on it was some of the melted cheese.

Always love the freestyle coke machine.

If I had one downside, it would be its just getting old inside and needs some updating."}

{"text":"Can always count on a good burger here. I've been here several times, quality is consistent, fresh, service is good. The place is clean. I love the old school Vegas artwork they have hanging all over the place.
This time I got the elk burger. Although not as big as the others, I guess a quarter pounder, I never leave feeling hungry. 
The meat was excellent, moist, not dry at all. Slightly gamey but just enough that you know it's not beef but something a little more exotic.
The buns are excellent...If I could only find these locally - but that's another story.

And of course the topping bar. Anytime I get free stuff, I'm happy. Well I think of it as free but it's the little things that make my belly smile. Any time I can load up a burger sky high with jalapenos I'm happy dude.

The one thing I'm not a fan of are their fries. The steak variety, not my personal favorite. Seasoned well though....Happy burger eating!"}

{"text":"Love this location.....there is a small group of friends who meet for lunch at this location a few times a year.  We enjoy it because it's close the Strip, where most of the group works.  We also like how it's less busy than the Summerlin Location....at least during lunch hour mid-week.

During my most recent visit, I had a 1/3 Burger with Cheese and Fries & Drink ($9.99).  It takes a few minutes for your Burger to be prepared, but it's worth the wait and not nearly as long as Fatburger.  The Burger was made to my specifications (medium).  I loaded it with Jalapenos, Onions, and melted Jalapeno Cheese....yum!

The employees are always friendly and greet everyone as they walk up to place an order.  Overall, a solid place to grab a quick bite to eat.

When I pulled up, I was surprised to see a sign advertising Free WiFi....perfect, now I found a new place to study!

After a few minutes I decided to go with the 1/3 lb Burger Combo ($9.99) and a 1/2 lb Burger ($5.99).  I ordered American Cheese ($.75) on one and Pepper Jack ($.75) on the other.

One of the things I love about Fuddrucker's is the fresh toppings bar where you can load up whatever you want on your Burger.  I decided to put Onions, Jalapenos, Mayo, and Mustard.  I also got some melted Jalapeno Cheddar Cheese for dipping my Fries.

The Burgers were tasty of course and the Fries were perfect!  The combo came with a Soda and I went with Coke Zero.....I'm not a Soda drinker, but I think I'm becoming addicted to Coke Zero.....have to stop that soon.

Overall, it was another great meal @ Fuddrucker's!

{"text":"Kudos to manager Britney for easing a bad situation. I play graveyard hours in the Orleans poker room and fuddruckers is the only food court option open. I get a large sweet potato fry and cover it with pickles from the topping bar--- apparently the toppings bar is only for hamburger purchasers and this is verboten. Alexis, the cashier, watched as I stood in line waiting my turn for the toppings bar. She waited for me to take the pickles, then she loudly called me out for stealing the pickles and triumphantly called another employee for back up to seize the evidence. Yes, she publicly shamed me for taking pickles. Really? 
The other employee told me to take it and go. I walked away but found myself upset over the event. I stood for several mi utes deciding what to do, then I turned and walked back to return the food and get my money back. I intended a clean break with fuddruckers. 
Britney  (hope the spelling is correct) listened to me and confirmed that this is the policy. I told her I did not want the plate and asked for my money back. After hearing the whole story she made me a fresh plate, refunded the money, AND delivered money and fries ( with pickles) to me in the poker room. 

The food is consistently good, and now I feel respected as a customer.

{"text":"First time here.  It's a burger joint with different size of beef burgers and meats.  You can put your own toppings for free.  Their fries are potato wedges ehich are seasoned really good.  The only I don't care is the do it yourself topping/ salad bar.  I'm a bit hesitant to use it as far as sanitation.  Don't know how often food is rotated.  At least the burgers are cook to order and come HOT."}
{"text":"I love the fries here!!! The burgwrs are pretty good and the Reeses shake is my favorit. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a good burger joint."}
{"text":"Fuddruckers has such a great concept. At this restaurant, you order your burger and dress it yourself at the condiments bar, and the best thing about it is that the ingredients aka the vegetables seem to be really fresh!

There is a ton of variety, as you are not limited to only burgers. They also offer chicken sandwiches, steak sandwiches, and salads as well. My favorite thing to get is a juicy burger and some potato wedges. I like having the option to select how big I want the patty, which is a great option because it serves either craving whether you are not feeling too hungry or have a humongous appetite. It's been a while since I had such a juicy, delicious burger.... the 3 cheese cooked medium was cooked to perfection. The buns tasted great as well.

I went there for lunch and it wasn't that busy. The whole restaurant was clean though!"}
{"text":"I miss the old burger place at the Orleans, but Fuddruckers is a good fast-food alternative. They feature a condiment bar where you can pile stuff high on your burger. They offer an interesting array of beef alternatives such as ostrich, buffalo and wild boar! I tried the wild boar this time. It was just ok: not as juicy or flavorful as their beef. But it's great that there's such a variety.

It's the most popular place at the food court, and you can get a beer at the near-by bar to go with. There's even a discount coupon for hotel guests."}

{"text":"Another reviewer wrote this about Fudds:

\"This is a good restaurant if you have children from toddler through middle school age. If you don't have children in tow you might want to visit another restaurant.\"

I have a ten month old daughter, so I'm writing from that perspective.

My family and I visited a few weeks ago after not having been in a Fudds location for geographical and menu reasons for quite a number of years.  My wife is a vegetarian and I haven't eaten beef for quite a while.  She got a veggie burger and I got a turkey burger.  They came out quickly and were as ordered, and for the price, they were quite good.  Sides (sweet potato fries and wedge fries) were similarly good.  Minor ding because they were a bit stingy with the fries.  I also love restaurants that have Freestyle Coke machines, because you can never get Cherry Coke Zero in a restaurant otherwise.

The topping bar is a Fudds trademark and I like that it puts the responsibility on the customer. One source of constant and often unjustified customer criticism of restaurants is that order customizations, regardless of where the customizations fall on the reasonableness scale, result in service errors.  I like topping my own burger.  It's a feeling of power and self-satisfaction that you don't get at other places.

I like the balance of this place.  Sometimes Red Robin or a similar restaurant isn't feasible with a tiny kiddo.  They tend to have a long wait there and it's a fully sit-down place, but Fudds does fast casual burgers well.  You're getting a bump in quality from McDonald's or BK without a huge bump in price.  As long as you have managed expectations with Fudds, then you should be good to go.  You can get a freshly cooked burger that's actually pretty good and is topped the way you want, a good side item, and one of a gazillion varieties of a Freestyled Coke product for like ten bucks.

And they have a kids' play area.  Boom.

In the end, I'm a fan, but I really wish their rewards program wasn't so beef-centric.  Would it kill you to give me a turkey burger instead of a beef burger?  Just sayin', Fudds.  Just sayin'."}
{"text":"The breakfast bowl is a rip off. And not that good. Says it comes with hash browns. For 9 bucks I think it should have more that 3 tator tots. Hubby said the burger was good . But the burger combo comes with 8 fries ...lol guess they are chincy with their potatoes."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a juicy burger and since I hadn't been to a Fuddruckers in years I thought why not! They definitely know how to make the everything look extremely appealing. Great selection on the menu from sizes of the patties to different ways to dress it. Love the way they have the condiment bar so you can dress your burger or sandwich yourself. The onion rings and fries are good especially with the cheese sauce. Patties are definitely juicy and taste good. I have had better burgers that I have given 4 stars. While this burger was good I just can't give it a full 4 stars. Enjoyed the food but not something I would really rush back to eat."}

{"text":"Market price for the ostrich burger was a ridiculous 18$ in early November 2012. For a minuscule patty. At Fuddruckers in the smoky ass food court of the Orleans. 

I cannot emphasis enough how absolutely asinine it felt to pay that much for a single menu item at the Orleans foodcourt.

The burger itself was not bad. It was not bad at all. Was it as good as (or better) than 3.5 Fukuburgers #2s (at 5$ a piece, one could eat 3.5 of them and still tip fifty cents, all the while supporting local businesses)? Fuck no. Or I don't even know how many In-N-Out DblDbls (I don't want to do that arithmetic)? Fuck no (in this sense it is not even better than one). You get what I am saying here. 

Setting aside the immense disappointment in paying higher than BURGER BAR prices for a tiny just good tasting burger in a shitty food court, my girlfriend is vegetarian for her own ethical reasons and had their veggie burger. She knows her veggie burgers, and she told me this one sucked and that it was just a pre-manufactured (not in-house) boca burger. I cannot remember exactly what it cost but it was probably 7$ or 8$ bucks. Go to Burger Bar instead (it is not THAT far away). - E"}
{"text":"4 years ago I would have given this place 4 stars. 4 because they used to serve Pepsi products and that's is just a personal preference. Also they prices then were in par with other locations across the country.

The food, correction the burgers are 5 stars in my book. The reason I give this place 2 stars is mainly that they are $2 -$3 more for their meals then all the locations here in Dallas. I can get a 1/2 lbs Bacon Cheese Burger combo for $8.99. My other complaint is that they don't have any Big Kids Meals for $5 flat. It means a small burger with fries, a chicken strip, cookie and a drink, or just 4 chicken strips with same stuff as the burger one. I've never been a big fan of their fries, but that never stopped me for driving an 1 1/2 hrs to a Fuddruckers in MN for example.

This particular locations condiment bar has also been reduced. No more red onions and they seem to have a hard time keeping the mayo and ketchup filled.

Fudds still has my business cause they are my favorite burgers, just not this location."}

Rather than rattle off the dozen or so things that I can't stand about this place, I'll settle with expressing the opinion of the silent majority inside my mouth. 

And that is: These burgers are tasty. And the topping bar as the \"2\" of that 1-2 punch is pretty devastating, leaving me with no choice but to heartily endorse this family-friendly shop of horrors. 

At least I'm honest."}
{"text":"Had a very poor experience last Friday. The wait to place your order was long and when a second person opened a register, she was RUDE! I ordered a turkey burger with no bun and a side salad (restricted diet) and she looked at me like I was crazy. When I said I wanted a 1/4 lb patty, she grunted, one size only. She omitted the cheese, even though I didn't ask for no cheese, and when I asked for salsa, pointed at the bar where I could get it myself. I had never eaten here before, so I was unaware it was available me there, no need to be rude. I was with two other people who ordered separate and by the time my dry, bland turkey party was called, my friends were done eating. I was then appalled to see that the woman who was so rude to me at the counter was apologizing to a table near me for an error with their food, so I am assuming she was some sort of leader at the facility. I am shocked that this woman was in any capacity to apologize for poor service. The only good interaction I had was with a female busses with long brown hair who asked to remove dishes and appeared to be working very hard. Needless to say, I will not be returning."}

The food was amazing! I got the veggie burger and onion rings and they were fantastic! The onion rings were the best that I've had in my whole entire life! I don't know what they are using for batter, but trust me when I say it is not like any other onion ring you have ever tasted! I'd come here just for those!

I like how the set up is that you order your burger and it's served plain with the exception of cheese. Then you make your way over to the self serve station to stack it as you see fit with lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles (or no pickles. I hate pickles!), ketchup, mustard and so on.

I am a huge fan of Smashburger and Fatburger, but this place is my favorite burger joint. Makes me regret even more that I moved from Summerlin to Henderson. You guys need to open one in Henderson!"}

{"text":"The burgers are great! I tried Fuddruckers for the first time by coming to this location. My only issue with this place was that it seemed like it was confused as to which type of restaurant it should be. The burgers are of excellent quality similar to what you might get at a fancy restaurant with orders taken by wait staff that are brought to you. However, the restaurant has a setup similar to a sports bar so it's really loud. There are also several gaming machines and children were running all over the place so it had the feel of a Chuck E. Cheese. It's as if they couldn't decide what kind of restaurant they wanted so they combined several different ideas. I really like the food and I love how you can put your own toppings on them. Hopefully when I return it won't be as busy."}

The chef in the back was staring everyone down and barely working. Not coming back."}

Burger was excellent and I enjoy being able to top it how I want as much as I want and then get a bunch of sauces for my fries. The fries are like steak fries kinda.  I am not a fan per say.

The service was very nice though.  And the ambiance was nice while I waited. I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan but it was good food for a good price."}
{"text":"Ok, going to keep this review short. 

I absolutely love their burgers here! It's been consistent at each visit! 

Only reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because the seating area is filthy. And when they do decide to clean they bring out a vacuum and clean right next to their customers. Like really? It's not how I want to enjoy my meal. Bring out a dust pan or something! Sheesh. And when they clean their tables they just throw all the crumbs on the floor and don't even pick up napkins laying on the floor. 

If it wasn't for the burgers I'd think this place is disgusting just because of its looks."}

Okay, you caught me.  I eat at Fuddruckers.  I used to go out of my way to eat at Fuddruckers for their exotic burgers (elk, bison, ostrich, etc.).  But most of their exotics are no longer available or cost way too much.  My last couple of visits have been for just your typical one pound burger patty with no bun.  If I'm hungry, I will make it a double (2 lbs.).  This burger patty is thick, on the greasy side, and necessary if you're behind on protein.  The service is quick depending on the length of the line or depending if the guest in front of you knows what they want.  I don't go to Fuddruckers often, but will dine here if I'm at The Orleans, looking for something that fits my diet, and something quick. 

TIP:  Conveniently located near Orleans Poker Room."}
{"text":"Quick Review:
Cleanliness:  4 stars
Staff:  4 stars
Food (taste/portion):  2 stars
Price:  1

Good stuff first...restaurant was clean and staff is as good as it gets.  Now for the bad stuff.  This visit was for one thing only....their Ostrich Burgers.  

For those that haven't had Ostrich before, here's the scoop.
-Low fat, about 5 grams
-Low calories about 194 (minus the bun)
-High protein, at least 40 grams
-Taste: Like Beef

Always been a fan of Ostrich and had it at least once a month.  In the California Fuddruckers, ostrich was eliminated from their menu due to cost.  I asked fellow Yelpers out here and Cat C. suggested to try Fuddruckers in Summerlin.  Thanks Cat C!!!  I bookmarked it and made a call.  Sure enough, they confirmed that this location still had it.  

As soon as I arrived, I noticed that the prices are still $9.99 for their exotic burgers.  Their exotics consist of Elk, Wild Boar, Buffalo, Salmon, Turkey, and Ostrich.  Ostrich didn't have the $9.99 price, it was labeled \"Market Price\". Market Price for an Ostrich Burger was $13.99 on tonight's visit.  Keep in mind that this didn't include fries or a drink.  This was bit higher than what I'm used to paying, but I just had to have it.  Then the cashier (possibly one of the supervisors) stated that all their exotics are no longer 1/2 lb burgers.  All have been reduced to 1/3 lb. This only made the $13.99 price for a burger now even more expensive.  Again, just had to have it.  She felt bad for me and hooked me up with a drink.  Wow, but it's the thought that counts.  

I gave this place an overall 3 stars because the price and portions.  Their service and cleanliness actually boosted their status to me.

Only had the Ostrich at this location and it was so good.  Just a bit expensive in my opinion.  

I've tried their other exotics at some point.  Here's my thoughts on them.
-Turkey Burgers:  Actually prefer Island's or Red Robin's
-Buffalo:  Taste and quality pretty good. My only issue is the after taste
-Elk:  A bit dry and the after taste is like Buffalo
-Wild Boar:  Never again. Imagine what a wild boar looks like. Then imagine what it would taste like.  Yes, that's what you get.

I'm still on my quest for a good ostrich burger at a decent price.  Due to the economy, all their exotics have been reduced to 1/3 lbs compared to 1/2 lbs a year ago.  I still know locations in San Diego that have ostrich burgers, but we're taking a 5 hour drive.  And plus, it's possible that they too have either eliminated ostrich or up'd the prices."}

What I liked are their in house baked poofy buns. The condiments are ok but not the freshest looking vegetables I've seen.
Service-wise we're talking very young minimum wage folks. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I love Fuddruckers, it's a great place to get a good, filling burger. This location is just good -- not great, but good. It can sometimes be very good, depending on who is cooking that day. I get the feeling this location relies heavily on a microwave (watch the cooks and if you catch them zapping your food speak up)! The seasonings are also sometimes \"off.\" On several occasions I've been either served a burger that tasted like nothing or as rubbery as a hockey puck. Other times I've been served the tastiest, juiciest, most super flavorful burger. 

The 3 Cheese burger is my favorite, I usually load it with super crispy bacon and then top it off on the fresh toppings bar. I really like the sweet relish and pico de gallo that's available on this toppings bar. One complaint is that sometimes the bar is poorly stocked. I was there a few days ago and the spicy mustard container was completely empty. 

The staff here is usually friendly and accommodating, though. It's a good spot for lunch (though at dinner time the place is less crowded)."}

{"text":"Since I was a kid, Fuddruckers has been my favourite place to get a hamburger. Their in-house baked buns are the most delicious I've had  and they always cook the burger itself exactly how you order it. I also love that I can put whatever - and however much of - I want on it myself. The seasoned fries are also thickly cut and delicious. Save room for a brownie or cookie - also in-house baked - and you won't regret it.

I always get a 1/3lb. medium-well plain then smother it with hot cheese, honey mustard, ranch or mayonnaise, and shredded lettuce. They'll ask you when you order if you want cheese on it but save the $0.35 and put your own cheese later - they have both normal melted cheddar and nacho cheese at the bar. More cheese and mustard for fries and sometimes I'll even make a little side salad. 

Fast, inexpensive, and DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"If you hate your colon, and want to do horrific damage to it, you should consider this place.  I'm not certain, but I believe there was a meal deal called the 'impacted intestine'.  The boasting of a 'toppings bar' are kind of sad, since lettuce was the featured topping.  The burgers are f'ing as big as you want them to be, and I think they get them in a box from Giant Eagle.  The service was bad, but I can only hope they spit in my food to give this greasy nightmare a hint of taste.  You can trust me on this, if you look them in the eye at any point, they will spit in your food.  Pray that you don't make small talk.  Also, completely dead while every other restaurant was packed.  Probably should have been the first red flag."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but way over rated.  It's a burger, where the toppings are located at a self-serve bar, with sneeze guards, that are never clean like the pictures show.

The cashier said they did, but when we went to get it, there wasn't any. Another worker said they ran out of tea and were not allowed to make more. The burgers were over priced, undercooked and grease dripped off of it. We were told they closed at 9:00 pm, but the hours posted on the door was 10:00pm and it was a Friday night. They were cleaning up and getting ready to close for the night. The restaurant was dirty and the ketchup pumps had dried food on the nozzle. We won't go back again."}

You hear so much about In-N-Out, The Habit, Lobby's, etc... But Fuddrucker's deserves a call out of it's own. I appreciate the cold toppings bar and the plentiful assortment of condiments. I am a sauce lover and this place has my name written all over it.

The cashier who took our order yesterday did forget to add cheese to my burger but in the end it turned out okay because to my delightful surprise, they have jalapeno nacho cheese sauce in their condiment bar!! I love cheese sauce, all of it's melty, gooey, chemical and yellow food coloring goodness lol. I also ordered sweet potato fries, not the best I have ever had but once again, the jalapeno cheese made up for this. I added grilled jalapeno's to my burger which were a spicy delight. The meat itself had a good smoky flavor to it. My fiance also very much enjoyed his burger. Overall I really would give the burger 4 out of 5 stars. They also have a plethora of other meal options. Anything from chicken sandwiches to salads to an elk burger. Many options which I am sure are great. The restaurant itself has kind of a throwback feel to it. A little bit 80's and 90's combined into one. Service was pretty good. Newer cashier who was taking our order but she was very friendly and asked for help from another associate when she had a question.

Very good experience overall. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'd probably rate 3 1/2 stars for multiple reasons. First I wanna say that the burger was very good, lots of flavor, nice and greasy, good bacon. My burger was on point. Unfortunately the combo was more expensive than what it should have been. The service was solid, the layout was ok, price was high, and it was coke products thank god. Solid place, would return. Just wish it was cheaper."}
{"text":"No jalapeno cheese sauce. The meat lacked texture. No beer sold here either. Other than that, it's Fuddruckers."}
{"text":"A decent burger for a reasonable price. The Rudd fries look better than they actually tasted which was a let down. The staff was very friendly here. I couldn't help but think of the film 'Idiocracy' every second I was there."}
{"text":"We were so excited to find a Fuddruckers. We used to take our kids to Fuddruckers. This is not a Fuddruckers. They probably brought the name. The meat was dry. Frozen patty. The condiment bar was absolutely unappetizing. My fries were cold and I had to order a fresh hot batch. They had no cheese sauce left I had to wait 10 minutes while they supplied more. No mayonnaise left. The service was poor. I will not be back ever."}
{"text":"This is Solely Based on a Day that I was there..
Upon Entering, You were greeted by the Counterperson, She didn't look Very Friendly, she took the Order & We sat and waited for the Order to Be Called! As I Scanned the Restaurant, there were Messy Tables, Meaning that either the People that ate there didn't Bother to Throw their Mess Away, or that the Workers in the Establishment were too busy to Clean Up the Tables. 

It took a while to get the Orders to us...I ordered a Strawberry Shake, and My Neice ordered a Burger...Usually if you call an Order its Ready for you to Pick it up, Well, not in My Case...She took her Time in Making the Shake, while My Neice's Burger was getting cold! 

I'm sure this is a Very Well kept Establishment, but it Clearly wasn't on the day that I Visited there! Maybe this was an Off Day for them, but....the Only Gripe I have for this Place is that when you Call the Person's Name over the Intercom, PLEASE make sure that Everything is Ready to go! 

I'll give it a try On another day...."}
{"text":"Can't say I've had the best food at this location, but it's not horrible. They have great, friendly service, but they just don't make their burgers the same way as other locations."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time here for Halloween! The staff was very friendly, the food was gast, and delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Fudds, we almost stop by here before leaving town. The girl working the register, I can't recall her name (very pretty, lots of tattoos) is always very friendly and is a pleasure to talk with. Burgers are always great here."}
{"text":"Been here three times total and so far I have not been let down. It is absolutely the best burger in Arizona. Amazingly seasoned and cooked burgers, and not to mention... A cheese pump! Also service is never bad here the staff always greets us with smiles"}
{"text":"Excellent if you feel a fast food craving, buffalo burger is outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"The best thing is the hangover burger in the morning with fires and a drink 1/2 pound patty of course."}
{"text":"Oh fuddruckers!  This is a pretty good hamburger place.  They have a few different sizes (lb) patties to choose from.  After you pick up your burger, you take it to the condiment station to make it the way you want.  They even have all you can handle liquid cheese (reg or jalapeño).  Save $$ and don't order cheese on your burger, use the free liquid cheese!"}
{"text":"First time to Fuddruckers!  Loved it, best burger I've had."}
{"text":"Not once have I ever had a bad experience here. Burgers are amazing! They're flavorful and juicy. I personally like the Swiss Melt and the Mushroom burger. Place is clean and staff is friendly. What more can you ask for? Come on over and treat yourself to some really good food!"}
{"text":"Food was decent.  Service was slow and the cashiers seemed bothered during our order and when we went back for our free cookie. Never been to this location and won't be back."}
{"text":"It was 3 a.m. Or something like that. I stumbled in here in desperate attempt to feed my stomach and get my senses straight. I can't even recall what I ate, but I think it was a breakfast dish with scrambled eggs and some meat. Also, some burger as well. It was decent. It's Fuddruckers. I think I was more surprised about how expensive this place was for the quality. But then again, it's inside of a casino, so it is what it is. 

I can't believe I ate here. Clearly, I wasn't thinking straight. But, Fruddruckers may have possibly saved my life. So, thank you."}
{"text":"I don't think the buns or the burgers are the same as they used to be.  I liked the buns, before, they had a taste similar to homemaker breads.
Burgers are good.  They keep switching out the menu -dislike.
Used to enjoy having the ostrich burger.
I really like the condiment area where you can top your burger with lettuce, tomatoes, jalapenos, pickles, onions, etc.  
Opposite side they have mustard, mayo, catsup, sleeze cheese, A-1 (why?), etc.
Seems they remodeled again fairly recently.  What do you call this new look?"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here one morning.  It wasn't very good and pretty overpriced to be honest.  I should have walked on down to subway.  One night we tried to get some breakfast because we saw they started serving breakfast at 2:00am.  We were disappointed to find they weren't serving at 3:15am.  They had closed for cleaning and then were kind of rude to us about how they weren't open.  Well when I finally got breakfast I was looking forward to the \"breakfast potatoes\". Well they turned out to be tater tots!  Blah.  I would stick to lunch at this place."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I tried this place out, I loved it!
They are a little bit on the pricy side for a burger joint but nothing too crazy. I tried there hamburger with a side of wedges. They serve you the plain burger with just the patty but they have a station where you can put whatever you want to your liking. I didn't go overboard on mine, but not much was needed, the flavor was already good.
Can't wait to visit again to try something new from there menu"}
{"text":"Burger was excellent. Cooked as ordered. Building your own burger allows you to make it just how you like it. Ordering for the first time can be confusing and persons taking the order not too helpful. Seems like they assumed we done it before.

The order came out quickly."}
{"text":"We had these back in Saint Louis and finally found it in the valley. They have GREAT Hamburgers and food. Very clean restaurant and very friendly staff. I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"This place is a bit more expensive than your average burger joint, but it's worth it! I love their chicken sandwiches and salads too. All their food is outstanding and fresh. I never have to wait real long for my food - The staff is friendly and the place is always clean. Very positive atmosphere."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Fuddruckers in Texas. If you want a good burger with \"do it yourself\" toppings it's a fun experience with a tasty burger and soft warm bun!  Also the shakes and cookies are delicious too. Onion rings are better than fries so always go for those!!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, ave hearty salads as well.  Nice selection of burger options, super toppings bar.   Good staff.  Not a fan of the wedge fries, kinda bland.  Needs a spice on the fries, or a shoestring tater.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Get the rib eye steak sandwich with all the fixings. Or the 1/2 pound burger add chili. You can't go wrong with either of these two dishes!!

I like the drink machine. They have everything soda including ginger ale and flavors to all sodas (vanilla, lime, cherry, etc) .

This is a great family spot."}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews but I feel I was ripped off bad. I ordered the jumbo hot combo and what I got was some something else. The actual hot dog was half the size of the bun. I wanted to go on Yelp and compare the dog with pictures, but the reception for my phone was horrible and couldn't load anything inside the Orleans casino. The hot dog itself tasted like the Vienna sausage( like the ones at Wiener schnitzel), which I think tastes like garbage. Anyways, I looked at photos right now and it's totally different from what other customers had gotten. Way bigger and the dog fit from one end of the bun to the other. Mine looked like the size of a ballpark frank and was half the size of the bun. Very very mad!
Edit: after looking online and researching more of how big the hot dog should be, I now know for sure I was ripped off. They either put one of the smaller dogs in the jumbo bun and passed it off as a jumbo, or they gave me a store bought dog. Whatever the case, I'm fine with giving this bad review. The fact a business such as this tried to pull a bait and switch on me and play me for a fool while taking my money, I cannot let this be without writing this review and warning others. Straight up bad business model."}
{"text":"The burgers are always good but why would change your onion rings REALLY want were you thinking? If something is good don't mess with it. Next Parents this is a restaurant no a play ground your children should not be running around like it recess at the brat farm.
I came here to eat not to watch out for little Johnnie doing a header in to my table.Ok"}
{"text":"My burger was cooked to order. Nice and juicy. I would recommend this place to any hamburger lover."}
{"text":"I don't know about burgers, but the salads were terrible.  My girlfriends and I actually got sick to our stomachs later.  They had a funny taste like bad oil or I don't know what.  Also - the doors, etc. were filthy - not a good first impression.  Not that busy for a weekday lunch - can definitely see why - will not last based on the all the competition in Madison."}
{"text":"I love this place so God damn much. I can't count how many times I've come to Fuddruckers and gotten their grilled chicken sandwich, and they have never let me down. My family and friends always come here with me and I've never heard a single complaint. Their food is always fresh, delicious, and they're surprisingly quick. The wait isn't too long. Love this place and will always come back"}
{"text":"I have heard of this place a million times and have heard how amazing their burgers are. I ordered the 1/2 lb Southwestern burger with potato wedges. The potato were delicious, the burger was...meh.
I expected to be completely blown away, but really it was just a burger. I did like the topping bar and the multitude of sauce options, it's nice to be able to dress you'd own burger. It wasn't bad, I just was wondering t blown away. Kind of expensive for what it is."}

{"text":"I ordered \"The worlds greatest hamburger\" and still joked about it but I kid you not this was the best burger I have ever had by a very long margin.

It was cooked and seasoned to perfection. I took some ketchup in case it was gonna be dry and ended up not touching it.

I went overboard a little and added mushrooms, grilled jalapeño's, bacon and guacamole. If I had a do-over I would have the exact same thing!! 

This has ruined all other burgers for me now, I will always compare them to this one and come up short ..."}
{"text":"My bf LOVES this place. We frequent it quite a bit. The buns are fresh, the meat is delicious, and the sides you get to add on yourself. Favorites are elk burger now, (it's new) but buffalo and ostrich burger were past favorites. Make sure you douse it with the nacho cheese sauce. Oh and the tricked out nachos, firehouse boneless buffalo wings, and oreo shake are pretty good too. The one located in the New Orleans casino is open 24 hours but the one that is on Flamingo closes at 11pm. It's a little pricey for a burger about $8 and they also have a breakfast menu that starts at 2am to 11am which I'd like to try one day."}
{"text":"Nothing like being belittled by a high school kid none the less, anyway on Father's Day I took my wife children and grandchildren out for lunch here. We arrived placed our order paid got our drinks and sat down to wait on our order to come up. The pager buzzed my son and I went up for our food when we had noticed that the order of nachos wasn't there I had asked if they were being made still when I was stopped very quickly by a teenager telling me as she rolled her eyes at me that no I did not and that's when I tried to say that I believe we did order them when she once again rolled her eyes at me then told me there only about $10.00 when the manager looked over then told her just give them to him. Lol at this point I'm getting a little frustrated so I did say to them I might not look like I can finance a trip to the zoo but I know I asked for them and no I don't need your charity I have my own money thank you. So I went to pay for them for real this time and the manager makes a big scene about don't worry she's going to buy them, real professional and way to make me fell 2feet tall.  
Just go someplace else"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised that this place is still open.  I still remember when it was \"new\" to Matthews and the concept very foreign to me.

I'd say you get a pretty solid burger and condiments.  The tomatoes, lettuce, onions, etc are all very fresh and at your fingertips.  Burgers are cooked to order and pretty quickly - you don't have to wait long to start eating.

The dining room leaves a little to be desired.  I think the same decorations are up since the opening so it is a hodge-podge of items and themes... really doesn't make sense really, but I think the important focus of this place is the burgers and food.

They do something special with the buns too... I can't put my finger on it, but they go so well with the burgers and hold up pretty well with burger.  A lot of times the buns fall away or are too small... I was super impressed with my bun this past visit."}
{"text":"Great service! Burgers were cooked to perfection, fries seasoned just right, freshly-cooked mushrooms were tasty on my burger! Even the buns were great. The condiment bar was fresh, clean and full. THE best onion rings I've had! Clean, clean restaurant. Easy parking. Shake machine broken though but thank you for saving me from the calories!  My boyfriend's comment: \"That's a good cook back there!\"."}
{"text":"It had been quite some time since her last Fuddruckers feast (8 years maybe?) Butta free birthday burger along with a newly featured menu brought her back and she loved every scrumptious second.  Everything was made to order just the way she liked, which was just right for a picky patty like her. She was able to order any type of meat she wanted (buffalo, elk and boar even), any size (big or realllly big), cooked any way she wished, and then given free rein to top it off in a variety of ways at the best condiment bar around. MELTED CHEESE PLEASE! If that wasn't enough, she was offered one the creamiest chocolatiest shakes in all the land to go alongside it. She opted instead to try her hand at the robotic soda machine that hosted some 42,000 different flavors which despite sounding delicious, never seemed to live up to the originals. Still, she had a grand ol' time and her hamburgered heart skipped (okay waddled) out one very happy camper."}
{"text":"As others have said, a very family-focused place, particularly on weekends. Great burgers, though, with hearty buns and a wide range of topping choices (which makes them better than the nearby Five Guys in my book). The steak fries are also tasty, with a crispy exterior. 

I thought 10 TVs in the dining area were overkill, and it would be nice if it were easier to navigate among the tables, since you have to walk back and forth to get your burger and put toppings on it. (This was complicated by them being slow to clear previously used tables, so there were a number of empty, dirty tables forcing us to sit further away for a clean one.) I got the bourbon burger, which comes with blue cheese, bacon, onions, and bourbon sauce. I'd get it again. 

Really nice that you can pay for one side and get both onion rings and fries. Ask for them \"half and half\". In addition to ketchup, you can also get cheese sauce, an option kids should love. My new favorite burger joint!"}
{"text":"Great experience.  We are from out of town and were able to use a birthday coupon at this location.  We came in about 8:40 pm on Wednesday and there was no one there.  They got us our food quickly and the food didn't seem like it was just sitting there under heating lamps.

Though we got over charged on something, it was because the cashier heard me wrong and quickly refunded the overcharge.  Service was awesome and they didn't rush us out of there, which we stayed almost an hour.

They gave us super great service and the food was good, too.  So, when we are back in Vegas, we'll come back to this Fuddruckers and it's also close to where my mom lives."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The meat is always fresh and amazing. Cooked right! Servers laughing and smiling. Fast casual food at a decent price! I get the works with cheddar instead of American. Yum!"}
{"text":"As many of my readers know, I don't review burger places very often, and when I do, I'm quite picky about the food. 

If a place will not cook a hamburger rare or medium rare it tells me that they don't trust their food. If they don't trust it, why should I?

We were a huge group of about 40 who descended upon this Fuddruckers. There are several other locations in the valley in case this is not close to you.

They have the distinction of grinding their own meat fresh each day in the window where you can see it. I count this as a big plus. You can order your burger in an assortment of sizes including and up to a full one pound burger if you have that much of an appetite. In addition, they also offer (depending on location and availability) specialty burgers ranging from bison to elk to wild boar. 

One of the really nice things about this place is that you can decorate your burger however you like. There is a condiment bar with everything from lettuce to sliced tomatoes to onions, etc. Your welcome to put as much or as little as you wish on your sandwich. Additionally, there are big dispensers for everything from ketchup to sauce to mayonnaise, etc. 

Don't like burgers? Try any of the chicken dishes. Again, they are cooked perfectly. You can also get a turkey burger, salmon burger, and even a vegetarian burger. There is something for everyone.

Their onion rings were a real treat, being battered just right and cooked perfectly. Fries come out just the same. 

Kids have their own special menu, and kids portions do not skimp on quantity.

Be sure to try their shakes. They are hand made and really thick. Have a fresh baked cookie to help you with it also. 

IF none of the above appeals to you, then try the salads. They are huge and fresh made.

This is a fun place to take a group or a family, and it won't break the bank.

It's clean, the food it good, and the service is fairly quick.

4 stars."}
{"text":"Never Have a Complaint about this Burger Joint, Super Service. I love their Burgers and Half & Half Orders of Onion Rings and Fries :) With Nacho Cheese. I always go to the one in the Orleans Hotel Casino!!! YUP!!"}
{"text":"I really like the food at fuddruckers, very good haven't had anything bad. But the point of this review is about one of the managers there. Her name is Nicole she's the sweetest nicest person on the world. Very caring and helpful and will make sure your order is exactly the any you want it everytime.  Nicole is the greatest , give her and Fuddruckers a try."}
{"text":"Whenever my husband and I go out we always have to make compromises because our taste in food differs so much! I gave in this time to his craving for burgers ...my craving today was for Kalbi. 

We decided to go to Fuddruckers because it's been a long time. We have one in our home town but we never ate there together. It kind of felt like a first date in a way. I remembered I used to go on dates to Fuddruckers in high school ...then songs from high school kept coming on . I will not say which ones because I don't want to date myself! It felt surreal ...and kind of funny. 

When the girl behind the counter asked what type burger combo we wanted she complimented my jacket right off. I added a star for that ....just joking I didn't ...I still remained objective. We both ordered a one item combo so basically it was a burger, fries , and a drink in my case . My husband had the onion rings instead. The two combos came to about $25.00. 

When we received our burgers we started to doctor them up to our specifications. The condiment section looked smaller then what I remember but it has all the basics of what you would want on a burger. They had tomatoes, lettuce, onion, jalapeno, and pepperchinis etc. They also had mayo, ketchup ,mustard and my favorite spicy mustard. On top of that they had bottles of A-1 sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and malt Vinegar. I took a bit of vine gear for my fries because some people say it's good together. It was okay . They also had melted cheese for your fries which I tried too. One was regular cheese and the other was Jalapeno cheese . I chose the Jalapeno cheese which was tasty with the fries. The fries come with spices on them so ordinary ketchup would also be good. 

The burger was tasty but I thought a tad overpriced for what it was. I think to make the pricing more worth while they should add two sides or add on a dessert since there are only three side choices fries, onion rings and coleslaw."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a handful of times. 

On this trip, we had the new Bourbon, Bacon, &  Bleu Cheese burger. It was pretty tasty, although the Bourbon sauce wasn't too flavorful. It was, also, loaded with grilled onions.

I like that the quality has been consistent at each visit. Good, but not amazing. I like that they have some less conventional options, like bison. I don't like that they have a self serve condiment/toppings station because I'm a bit of a germophob, but I know that most people probably love it.

Service is pretty good. It was slow on this visit so that may have helped. We didn't have to wait to order, food came pretty quick, and there was someone working the dining room to whisk away your trash.

My biggest complaint on this visit was that the area where you get your drinks and straws and napkins was pretty trashed. There were straw wrappers all over the floor in front of it for example.

Overall, I would give it a B-"}
{"text":"Met my husband for an early dinner after a work thing. It's been absolutely forever since I was last at a Fuddruckers, so I was sorta excited.
It looks like this place hasn't changed since the day the built it. That's said in both a good and bad way. While it appeared overall clean it did need a little updating.
We ordered our burgers and shakes, the gal asked us how we wanted our burgers cooked - that was a pleasant surprise, I don't remember that from the last time I went (it's easily been 10 years). We both got medium rare. Unfortunately, that's not how they came. I'd suggest they were more medium to medium well.
We choose a table that was horribly wobbily, so switched tables. Table 2 needed to be cleaned, part of the table was sticky.
The fixins bar was plentiful. The shredded lettuce looked a little brown but they also offer green leaf and that looked vegetable-appropriate.
The shakes were super yummy, he got chocolate and I got Oreo.

They had 2 adorable tables that were set up inside bed head/footboards. So awesome!"}
{"text":"Good food, decent price and best of all in my books is that I can put what ever toppings on it that I want.  Reminds me of Burger Chef back in the hay day!  Downfall is the burgers can get pricey."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Fuddruckers, I think the the fresh grilled bun gets me every time.  I love the side inexpedience and the spicy mustard.  I pile on jalapenos, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, mayo, spicy mustard, & ketchup onto my 1/3lb cheese burger.  What can I say, it is a consistent great meal when I am in the mood for plain old American tradition.  I have been going to many of their location over the years and I was sorry to hear that the Highland and 20st location closed but I still have Metro and Arrowhead locations to fill my craving.  Also the atmosphere is great and very casual, my kids also love this place since there are games for them to play and the decor has so much going on that it is very kid inviting."}
{"text":"Free WI-fi!  Got to love this place, it has been here for years but they just remodeled recently on the inside.  It is very casual and has the new soda machines that are pretty cool.  I love their hamburger even with all the new burgers shops coming out Fuddruckers is a staple.  They make their buns fresh and their burgers are consistently juicy.  I love that I can stack on all my own condiments and they are all fresh and tasty.  I love me some Fuddruckers."}
{"text":"I really don't see the purpose of having a server in a non-fine dining burger joint.  She's rude and obnoxious. The food taste different than when I ate here 2 years ago. Will not be back due to crappy services and dirty restaurant."}
{"text":"Caution:  If you look at the *other*  reviews, you will see other people complaining about the cooks sneezing on the grill and nose picking, seeing cockroaches and filth.  My review is of our recent experience. 

We got in line to place our order.  While in line, we scouted out a table that would accommodate the 7 of  us and there was only one.  Although the table had been wiped off, the seats were dirty and there were squished hamburgers and french fries squashed into the carpet underneath that table. Not just a few...many.  

After placing our order, which  was $100 for hamburgers and french fries for 7 people, the floor and chairs had the same mess, so we asked if they could clean that place.  (Most tables there only seat 4 people) 

We walked over to the table and the girl who was cleaning the table was mad and told us that we could have chosen any other table...she would have pushed them together for us.  Really, there were not 2 next to each other and I am not sure why she would make a big deal about cleaning this table.  Factually, it was a disgusting eyesore for everyone around.  Fuddruckers is not really an inexpensive place to buy hamburgers, it was $14 per person on average and some of our party were children.  The point being, no one wants to pay that much money and sit  in a really filthy place.  In my opinion, they do not have enough employees to designate for cleaning and this girl was overwhelmed.  She kept complaining out loud where guests could hear.

It got worse:  While waiting for our food, some guests got up because there was a COCKROACH on their booth and we watched in disgust for 5 minutes while this employee chased around the cockroach and then found others, which were apparently coming from under the booth seat ( It was the kind you can lift the chair top off and the bottom is a hollow wood bench. ) 

They called our name and we went to pick up our order.  Unfortunately, they had overcooked my child's chicken tenders so much it was a dark brown and hard as a rock.  They did remake it, but the fact is, they never should have tried to serve something like that.  Where is the quality control?  

Bathrooms are grimy, black grime is built up in every corner.  The carpets need to be cleaned.

So, attitude, unsanitary and burned food.  It's gone way downhill since our last visit.  Maybe the health department needs to come take a look."}
{"text":"My all time favorite lunch spot when I lived and worked in the Southwest...not the healthiest but definitely hits your right in the flavor zone, it's that good.

Choose your burger size, style (they have a create your own option), every single time I walk out of here, I walk out with a more than full stomach. Reasonably priced and very casual - duh, it's a burger joint, but like, not the kind that gives you a stomachache for three days...

Milkshakes are awesome and the place itself is always clean. 

Overall a great place to pop in for a quick lunch, easy dinner."}
{"text":"We stopped by this location on a Saturday afternoon and this place was packed. there were kids everywhere. We ordered and we didn't get our food for like 30min. I had a 2/3 pound burger and finished about 3/4 of it. The food was great...just like any other location. It was one of the smallest locations I have been to, maybe it seemed crowded because of that. Otherwise everything was fine. I doubt I would go back on the weekend in the afternoon but maybe another time. 

MZ"}
{"text":"The service was great, burgers were fresh and hot, the chili cheese fries were great, and all of the toppings at the burger bar were fresh.  The place was clean, too.  The food was ready quickly.  Spent $36 for three of us, but well worth it.  It had been 20 years since I had been at the one in Mesa, AZ, and it was just how I remembered it.  Will be going back again."}
{"text":"well this isn't the same fuddruckers I was last at a couple months ago, things have changed for the better.

They have jalapeno cheese sauce now. Up until today, it was the only fuddruckers I had been at that did not have it. There was also a lady in a blue shirt (manager maybe) wandering around the dining room filling drinks, asking how the food was and taking away plates. It was something I wasn't used to coming here before and was a nice touch, almost like a real live sit down restaurant. It was a great improvement since the last time I was here and it was very welcomed."}
{"text":"Fuddruckers is overpriced fast food.  

The food is boring, the staff look disinterested.

At least the place was clean the once time we ate there.

Wendy's tastes better, is cheaper.  

Skip this place and just go down the road to Steak and Shake where they even bring you your food."}
{"text":"Burgers we're mediocre, nothing special. I could have made a  better burger at home probably. Cost $27 for 2 burger combos. I could have fed 4 people at in n out for the same price and been a lot happier. Only plus about this place is you put on your own vegetable toppings from the vegi bar. Also the iced tea was awful.! Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Always like this place. Fresh rolls and great fixin bar for the burgers."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 4 stars, but I just couldn't.

My fiance and I just recently visited here last month. The customer service has always kind of sucked though. When we recently came here, the burger was desperately lacking in seasoning. It was SO disappointing because a Fuddruckers burger is usually really good!

This place is extremely personalized though. You get to choose what toppings to put on your burger. It's a little station right when you walk in. The cheese sauce also needs salt. It never has any flavor.

I also love how they have a bakery too. Their sugar cookies are really good. This place would be booming if they would up their seasoning a bit. The amount of fries they give you though is not enough."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat. My coworkers and I usually eat here once a week on Fridays. The burgers are delicious, but I really enjoy the buffalo and elk burger. Next to try is boar. I really enjoy the self serve topping bar for your burger. Whether you like tons of onions, pickles, jalopenos. You can do it here."}
{"text":"For being an expensive hamburger place. The food is not that great and the bathrooms are disgusting. I don't know if it was the food there or something else but my son got sick the night we ate there. So be careful."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location the food is perfect. The burgers are so juicy and cooked to perfection. They have a condiments bar with fresh vegetables. The fries are my favorite of all time. They have the new soda fountain machines that are touch screen and let you create a custom soda. The price is a little higher then most but you get what you pay for. I can't think of a reason to take away a star."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience I have ever had. We thought we would grab a bite at fudruckers on 77th and bell. Since kids eat for 99 cents on Monday with the purchase of a meal. When I placed my order the shift leader or manager Miss Sansone seemed very angry and in a bad mood. She attempted to take my order but messed it up. Then barked at me that she was going to start all over. She banged on the screen and banged things around then she gave me the total, I questioned why I didn't get the kids meal at 99 cents. Well, that was it she flew into a rage and started yelling at me that I needed to read the sign and that it's not her fault that I couldn't read the sign right. The she said she was having a great day until I came in. I was in complete shock. It was like if I didn't like whatever price she wanted to charge me then, though. She even said as much. Then it got worse, I said that I have never been treated so badly by anyone and that all I was trying to do is order. At that point she turned around and shrugged, I said I need your name. So she whipped around and took her name tag off and stuck it 1 inch from my face in a very aggressive manner.  Then she gathered all her staff and as I overheard her she very loudly complained about me questioning the  price of the bill. Then the whole time I tried to have a  meal with my family she and her staff loudly laughed at my family and myself making gestures at me. I finally pulled out my phone to get it all on video and photos. Halfway through the meal we were too aggravated to sit through this awful experience and we just got up and left. Then this awful human being followed me out to my car!!!! My kids were crying! All because I questioned why I didn't get a discount. Some people should not be in customer service. By the way a previous yelper had the an awful experience with the same person look up Melissa b.'s review."}
{"text":"Stopped by this Fud location on our way up to the Anthem outlets last night.  J had a free birthday burger coming to him.  

We were informed that the coupon only covered a basic burger.  No cheese..nada.  And that toppings were à la carte.  So if you wanted to order a Inferno burger, you had to pay for the cheese, jalapenos, and whatever else comes on it that you cant get at the toppings bar.  $1 a piece.  

I got a 1/3 lb burger (1/3 is unfortunately the smallest you can order..I seem to remember ordering a 1/4 at the tempe location for my birthday in Feb..maybe i'm mistaken. *Shrug*) with satueed onions and blue cheese.  The burger was cooked to my liking, which was a plus.  And they didnt chince on the onions or blue cheese.  The fries were maybe luke warm, at best.  

One of the positive things about dinner last night - 
Monday's all kids meals are only 99cents.  Baby C enjoed his grilled chicken sandwich.  The chicken seemed on the small side as it did not take up the whole bun.  I tossed away most of the bun cause I didnt want him having all that bread.   It came with fries or fruit, and I got him fruit.  What came was half an apple, sliced.  Coulda gotten that at home.  *shrug*  At least Baby C's meal was only 99cents."}
{"text":"What the Fuddruckersl?!  How do you go charging $1.69 for 4 freakin slices of apple?!  

Anyhow.  

We went last week to grab my free birthday burger.  Standard fare.  Normal burgers and fries.  But seriously....charging almost $2.00 for 4 freaking apple slices for my infant?!  

Next time I'll just bring my own apple darnit.  

Good burgers and fries.  Keep your stinking apples."}
{"text":"no no no no no. got suckered into going here because of their buy-one, get-one-free coupon(look on web).
ordered rare, but was cooked almost medium brown. beef is poor quality (2 bone chips + gristle) and not flavorful.
the balsamic onions were overmarinted and the onions included, amazingly, *onion rind* -- yes, the hard outside layers of the onion were added to the burger toppings. NASTY.
stay away."}
{"text":"First off the service here is great.  They were kind, polite, and helpful.   


The food was very average and plain.  It was simply blah.


Now for this bad, this place attract terrible people. If I had to reduce the human population I would start with anyone who frequently eats here.  I walked in and I could hear 3 children screaming at the top of their lungs.  I then see some massively obese women caring 6 cups and filling them up soda and complaining.  

I then see a biker gang complaining about something stupid.  

All I could see was families stealing napkins and wasting little ketchup cups. 

I'm sorry to anyone who works here. You deserve more respect and money.  I hope those teens find better jobs."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying this place for a lot of years and it was in a serious slump for the last maybe 2 years but when we visited last week it was back to where it once was.  The burger was quality, and the service was friendly.  

I do wish they'd do a better job of cleaning tables but aside from that it was a pleasure to be back at a quality Fuddruckers experience. This is a great place to get a quality inexpensive place for the whole family."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain. However, they have a good product- perfectly cooked burgers on fresh ingredients. I have the 1/2 Lb Works burger and it slays my hunger every time. They customize the burger as you wish. The adds are good too- steak fries , fresh veggies for toppings etc. 

It can be a bit pricey, but worth it compared to lower quality burger stops. Their shakes are also good, so try then if you have saved up some calories. 

This location has good staff that is polite and patient. Appreciate that."}
{"text":"Quality ingredients and fresh toppings make this place a great place for a burger. The facilities are somewhat clean (except the diaper change area in the men's room...ick). My kids love the free cookie with their meals, my wife thought the gluten free bun was the best she's ever had. $39 for two adults and two toddlers makes it tough to come here regularly for families."}
{"text":"Feeling the brunt of a Post-hiking appetite, I stopped at Fuddruckers on the way home from Mount Charleston. This was my first stop in a Fuddruckers since 2011. It hasn't been easy to stop in a Fuddruckers when this is the remaining one of two in Las Vegas (the other one is in the Orleans). 

  The remaining freestanding Fuddruckers stands in the Target-Sear's Grand Shopping Center to the southwest of the 215 and Flamingo Road. It is a large restaurant served by a larger parking lot reaching to Target. Inside, there are numerous seating areas between walls covered by Las Vegas and Hollywood nostalgia pictures. The decorations include pics of Elvis Presley and a mural mimicking the \"Welcome to Las Vegas\" sign that says \"Welcome to Fuddruckers Las Vegas\" sign. Closer to the entrance there are two arcade machines including Ms. Pac Man. The wall decorations and two arcade games come in handy to keep your mind occupied when it takes at least twenty minutes for your hamburger to be ready. 

    Fuddruckers is similar to the higher priced self service hamburger restaurants. You order off a menu at the counter, pay exorbitant prices, then pick up the food when the buzzer goes off. The menu choices included burgers, a chicken sandwich, Buffalo burger, shakes, and Americana food. The menu breaks down the burger choices between 1/3 and 1/2 pounder. An additional $4.59 upgrades it to a meal. 

   At the counter, in a restaurant filled with families and teenagers, I ordered the Works burger. The 1/2 pounder version costed me $8.04 before the value meal. I paid an additional $4.59 to enjoy my burger with fries and a Coke. After paying Regina $13.66, she explained the Fudruckers process. When my buzzer went off I would pick up my food at the counter. There are two Coke Freestyle machines to fill up the glass. There is a topping bar to the left to top off my sandwich. 

   When I picked up the food twenty minutes later, I was confident that the cooks in the open kitchen made it fresh. At Fuddruckers they leave the top bun open to show the inside of the sandwich. The open top bun that is supposedly made in house fresh every day showed a burger with bacon, Swiss cheese, and mushrooms. That was before my trip to the toppings bar. Courtesy of the toppings bar, I added tomatoes, onions, and jalapeños on the side. I passed over the pickles and lettuce. When all was said and done, I was biting into a thick burger that was good yet nothing exceptional. I'd detour from the burger to work on the potato wedge fries. By the time I left Fuddruckers after a five year hiatus, my post-hiking appetite was momentarily gone. 

   In conclusion who knows if it will be another five years before I return to Fuddruckers. In all honesty for the $13.66 I exchanged for a self-service restaurant burger combo, there are far better dinners that I could have brought for around that price range."}
{"text":"Yum!  Love their pickles.  The only thing is, when they asked if I wanted fries, rings, or a little of both.  I didn't realize it would be a LITTLE bit of both.  Maybe 8 fires and 6 rings.:shrug:"}
{"text":"Great exotic burgers, but can't fully execute the most simple burger at an low price.

Coming from SoCal, home of In-N-Out, I've never really heard of Fuddruckers till someone mentioned it to me. Check out my In-N-Out review for the different types of burgers. Fuddruckers fit in the more complicated and beefy restaurant gourmet burger, so expect to pay a bit more than In-N-Out, Jack In the Box, or others.

Ordering was a little tricky at first because of the options, but also because the mention was a little confusing. I went with the 2/3 lb burger, fries, and drink combo. Total came out to about $11 which is wow. But like I said before, gourmet burger hence the higher price tag.

First bite made me go, this burger is certainly not worth the price. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad, but not worth the money for what I got. The fries weren't anything special and I love fries. I felt I should have just grabbed something at In-N-Out and get something that tastes as good and be cheaper.

This place shines in the exotic meats like ostrich, elk, and bison. Didn't get a chance to try it, but maybe next time. Its worth trying for the exotic meats, but this place doesn't instill much confidence in me when it can't execute a simple burger at a non restaurant burger price."}
{"text":"The only reason I give these place three stars is because every time I have an order I have to wait for at least 35 mins. Once I fell asleep waiting for my food to be ready and all I had was a burger. So prepare to wait. Also I asked for my eggs to be cooked lightly but when I received my eggs they were as brown as me."}
{"text":"It had been many, many years since we'd been to a Fuddruckers.  We figured it was about time to give it another try.  I'm glad we did.  For one thing, we only remembered hamburgers on the menu.  Were we ever wrong.  This place has a lot of variety including great salads, fish'n chips, wings, chicken and I'm sure you get the picture because the list goes on.

Everything is cooked fresh and the freshly chopped and sliced toppings are there for you to put on your on burger or order.  You could make yourself a salad from all the fresh veggies available.
 
The food was amazing.  It was hot and delicious.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Fuddruckers isn't a new concept. In fact, I think this location specifically has been here since I've been in Charlotte, and that is not a short period of time. To their credit, they tried to make the \"better burger\" concept, they were just a bit too early to the boat - and they didn't do a terribly good job at it - people wanted a better burger (witness Five Guys, Freddy's, Smashburger, etc) after all, they just didn't want the Fuddruckers version of it, at least for long.

The idea is great, especially 20-25 years ago. Now, the whole thing is just tired, and you get the feel when you go in and there are about three people in there. It isn't that it's bad, exactly, it's just that it's not that great. Sort of like the burger that time forgot. I almost expected a sleestack to come out from around one of the brick columns in the place.

Too bad, really, because the Fudd could have been the first to take on the fast food burger places, since they had the early jump on the concept."}
{"text":"We enjoy Fuddruckers although we don't come often.  Employees at this location were friendly, which I very much appreciate. We were greeted as soon as we entered and the person taking our order was patient.  My only complaint is that I specifically ordered my salad with no tomatoes and my salad seemed to have extra tomatoes.  The receipt/ticket clearly said no tomatoes. Please pay attention people!"}
{"text":"This Fuddruckers location is just down the street from where I live... so I've been here on quite a few occasions. However, the whole \"exotic\" burgers they've been promoting the past month or so have gotten me more excited to visit them. I was really looking forward to trying an ostrich burger... but alas, ostrich isn't in season until November. I ordered a wild boar burger instead.

It was quite tasty. I got it with pepper jack cheese and bacon (because topping of wild pig with more pig just made sense)... and it was quite filling. :) 

I've never been disappointed with service at this location. So yay for Fuddruckers!"}
{"text":"Craving for a juicy and cheesy burger? Not calorie counting? Then this place has got what you need! I have tried the quarter pounder cheeseburger and chili cheese fries. They are covered in the thickest pieces of cheddar, swiss and provolone cheese I have ever seen. The buns have a slight sweetness to it and is pretty dense. I would want to guess it almost tastes like a brioche bun. The meat is juicy and seasoned with salt and pepper. Fuddruckers just doesn't hit the spot for a night of gluttony, it punches the spot."}
{"text":"Always love the burgers here! 

I only bump a star for the soda machine. While I get the appeal of being able to choose from dozens of soda flavors, I find that most don't taste as good because they're all a bit tainted by the previously dispensed flavor. This goes do any restaurant, theatre, etc. that uses that type of machine."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Fuddrucker's since early '09, and I hope that all of the issues that Tara M. brought up in her review have been addressed, it seemed fairly clean in the ten or so visits I've made this year. I dig their burgers, legit fresh quality ground beef cooked up on the spot works for me. The buns are delectable, and a perfect compliment. Nice condiment bar with a good selection of choices, and big, seasoned fries (wedge-style) round things out nicely. 

Yes, the interior is kinda kitschy and tacky (long overdue for an update or total remodel), and the exterior is pretty dated, but I don't come here for those things. It's a little on the pricey side, but I'm willing to throw down a few extra bucks for the quality of food which has been very consistent here."}
{"text":"Fuddruckers is a burger place. Unfortunately you pay $30 for two people to have a combo and the burgers are flavorless. I don't understand why most burger places don't create their won meat mix of different cuts, mix their beef with ingredients or at least season their meat. The toppings on top are great but they don't add flavor to the actual hamburger patty. My wife got the Kobe burger..of course a $9 Kobe burger isn't really Kobe beef but it was flavorless as well."}
{"text":"Burgers was so delicious. The bread is so fresh, the burgers were so juicy. I was very happy. Everything was top of the line and was very happy with the food. 

The staff was super friendly, and already craving for another burger. Try this place. You won't be mad you did."}
{"text":"Ha! I haven't been here in y.e.a.r.s! But my BF decided to take me out to lunch because I was having a sad day (I had to give away my puppy to a friend....my older dog was jealous and the puppy wouldn't stop nipping at him and he kept eating the furniture {I tried for over a year to train him!}) and he thought old school Fuddruckers would cheer me up. It was pretty much how I remembered it from middle school. The burgers were pretty decent and the fries were okay too. I liked how they had a ton of different sauces to choose from for your burgers and fries but it didn't really like the open area of lettuce, tomato, pickles, etc... it looked clean but kids with their germy kid hands were touching the toppings and it kind of grossed me out a little. I wish all burgers just came with those toppings on the side so no one else is touching your food but I get weird with stuff like that. I got the regular burger with swiss and mushrooms and he had an elk burger, both were cooked to order. It was a lot of food and neither of us could finish everything. Overall we had a good experience and it did cheer me up!"}
{"text":"We love this place! It's the 1/2 lb. original burgers that we love. This is an outstanding burger with a nicely butter toasted bun, crisp fresh toppings that you can pile on (the toppings salad bar is always kept impeccably clean), the fries are to die for, the milkshakes are delicious and on top of it all...a very caring, friendly, hardworking manager whom makes all of our visits an enjoyable dining out experience!! These are our favorite burgers of any restaurant in Madison, seriously they are that good!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I ate Fuddruckers and I was pleased with the quality of their food.

Pros-
*Food Tastes good
*Time was reasonable 
*Choose your own condiments 
*Good customer service 

Cons-
*It did not look clean
*The tomatoes looked like they had sat out for a long time
*Its expensive for the amount of food I received

I read a lot of reviews on Foodruckers, and they did not look to good. They look like they have a lot of customers. I would personally come back, but its expensive."}
{"text":"I saw on-line that they have veggie burger. I went there today, they have black bean burger i/o veggie burger. Few minutes later, they told me that no more black bean burger. So, I tried manager ref, kobi burger (or Cobbie? )..
The flavor is ok. I will go back to try something else next time."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Veggie Burger is good and so are the shakes.  The condiment bar is also clean and has fresh veggies and condiments for you burger. Also has a wide variety of sauces and toppings."}
{"text":"This is the plainest Fuddruckers I have been to. The decor is simple, the condiment section is the smallest I have seen. The staff was inattentive and looked like they were ready to call it a night at 8:30 pm on a Saturday. The prices at this location seemed higher than what I have paid for at other fuddruckers. Burgers were ok but not great like I have had other times. The fries were cold and looked old."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Fuddruckers!  The burgers are awesome and the garnish bar is a great idea!  Prices are very reasonable and the staff is friendly!  Don't forget a cookie, as they are to die for!"}
{"text":"Always have a great experience...you can tell they have a culture of customer service from the way you are greeted to the food presentation.  The 1/3 burger leaves my belly full!  Love the hotdogs from here too!  When I went for take out looks like some one broke the door...idiot....he must have been hungry like me! =) you can call in advance and have it ready rather than waiting after u order..."}
{"text":"I've been going to Fuddruckers regularly for the last 10 years and their burgers are second to none. Tonight my experience was a little below average, but the manager got with me minutes later about the problem and resolved it accordingly. 

Great burgers & tonight it showed they have great customer service too!!"}
{"text":"Friend and i stopped by for lunch and halfway thru the meal i found a hair in my hamburger.  After being sick in the ladies room i took the 1/2 eaten meal to the front and informed the worker if the incident.
The young assistant manager came to the table and asked if she could give me a free  meal.
At this time im feeling the second wave of nausea coming over me and am heading once again for the restroom.....
I informed the young lady chances are after finding that black hair in my burger i would not be back.  She interrupted with a confidant..'it wasnt black, it was blonde, do you want to see it????...its on the side of the  plate?'
Now... i know it was black... it came out of My mouth.... was she trying to tell me something?( i have blonde hair)?
Anyway.... it was like pulling teeth to get a refund from this person.  I did finally get a refund of 6.00 for the burger.  I guess i cant complain.  Whatever happened to the days of customer service?????  God help the next generation of business if this is the type of managers you are training for your businesses"}
{"text":"We all got burgers and they were pretty good.  We went with sweet potato fries and onion rings. Sweet potato fries were crispy and good flavor not too salty. Love that I could put as many pickles on my burger as I wanted! Gave 4 stars because I ordered my burger on wheat and the bun was old.  But the boys said their buns were great.  Clean and good staff."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to check this place out since I moved to the valley more than 3 years ago but had not heard good things about it. My company just moved to office space nearby and I decided to give them a shot. Good burger. I love being able to add my own toppings. 
Good fries. Nice, clean restaurant. They have one of those fancy Coke machines that has several different flavors of diet coke. Boy did I have fun with that!

One of the staff offered to take away our garbage and also offered to-go cups without us even asking. I would have no problem coming here again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Well I love a good burger and fries and this place happens to make a great meal! I walked in and there was no line which is always a plus. I quickly placed my order and patiently waited for my meal. Finally my number was called and I received my delicious burger. I then walked over and piled on the toppings! They have a bunch of sauces to  choose from....even cheese!! I got a little extra cheese sauce for my fries. Overall this was a great experience and I am looking forward to coming here for my next burger craving"}
{"text":"On demand cheese sauce for my fries? Nuff said!

The ambiance, service and funky mismatch of retro and country sitting areas are always fun to experience. That whole phenomenon reminds me a bit of McDonald's, how they all somehow remain very similar regardless of the venue. Then again, that's where the similarity of mcDs and FR ends. These burgers are the real deal. Great prices, (and you never leave hungry, that's for sure) nice people and convenient locations always keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Ate here today for a small business meeting & had the Southwest Burger combo with the Wedge fries. The fries were seasoned very well and cooked well, and same goes for the burger. The guacamole + jack + honey mustard made the burger practically perfect. I'll admit to being in a total food coma afterwards, which maybe isn't the best for a business meeting, but it was so worth it! 

Husband tried the BBQ burger, he loved it as well-- this says a lot. The burger had grilled onions which means they really did it right."}
{"text":"I grew up in Houston, TX and have been eating at Fuddruckers for almost 4 decades.  I still like the concept.  Beef that is fresh ground on site and cooked to order.  Toppings and condiments are self serve.  I happen to love jalapeno's and make a side salad of jalapenos ;).  The menu has expanded to includes lots of other items but it's the 1/2 pound burger that I go for almost every visit."}
{"text":"I love Fuddruckers!!!... best burgers for the best price! If I ever crave a giant burger, this is where I go. #1 Burger joint in my book. They have made some great changes to the menu by bringing on new and exciting items, while keeping the main items on board. Love having Hidden Valley ranch available for my fries!!! Love the toppings bar, love the cheese, and LOVE the in-house baked buns!

The cons:

Decor. Super outdated. Not that I care, otherwise, I would have dropped a star. But, the general public does. It feels like walking into the 80's. 

Staff isn't all that friendly. Again, not a big deal to me, but if you want a strong core of 'regulars', hospitality is the way to do it. A smile, an excited greeting, a recommendation, and polite/light conversation go a long way. 

Never once, in the many times I've eaten here, has someone ever checked up on us. Seems like good practice, would be to make sure everything is great. This is the size and the feel of a casual dining restaurant, with the hospitality of a fast casual or fast food restaurant. 

So, in closing, I'm just here for the burger - it's the BEST. I love the fact that it's not busy, but I don't want to see the place close down. After all, this is where I get my giant BURG fix!

Good luck Fuddruckers and thanks for the amazing BURGERS!!!"}
{"text":"Fuddruckers used to serve a decent buffalo burger.  Then one day they changed to lower quality meat.  Not sure when it happened, but I bit into a burger filled with that public school luncheon type meat.  Maybe they gave me the wrong patty, I dunno. My stomach hurt afterwards and I haven't been back to Fudd since then."}
{"text":"Wow! When did Fudruckers become a high dollar steakhouse?  Came in for their new Chipotle bison burger only to find out the burger alone is over $17 not including drink or fries! I don't think so, I will stick with the third pound burger, may have to find another burger joint. Can't wait to see the price when the mininum wage goes to $15 an hour."}
{"text":"My sister compiled a list of burger places she wants to try in LV, so we've been on a mission to cross them all off the list. This was one of the places. 

We were a little intimidates because the line was so long (a little league team was here and the families were all arriving one by one).

The cashier was really friendly and welcoming, and was very quick. 

We ordered: 
Three cheese burger, medium rare, add blue cheese and bacon - the burger was more medium and didn't have any bacon on it. 
Buffalo burger with provolone, medium - wasn't sure what temperature is recommended for buffalo, so she recommended medium. It actually turned out more medium well than medium. 
Elk burger, medium - she also recommended medium for this one, but it was also more medium well.
Fudd's fries - these were pretty awesome!!! 

Pros: I do like that the sauces and veggies are available at condiment and topping bars. Service is super quick, even though the line is still pretty long 

Cons: temperature on the meats. We also felt mildly claustrophobic, but again it was pretty busy. 

It's definitely worth trying, though!"}
{"text":"I want to this location today for lunch although the food was made fresh the burger was terrible the bun was obviously still in hard the fries were flavored great hot but funky the three stars are strictly for customer service which was great"}
{"text":"i do enjoy going to fuddruckers, the food is good and the staff keep the place clean. I like how much condiments you can put on your own burger. i have not had a problem in the past 4 years that i have been going here."}
{"text":"Ok, so I helped my friend Angie move today, and in turn, she bought me dinner afterwords.  We both were so tired, and this was the closest place to the truck rental she used, and I decided to go here.

I did not like the inside when you imediately walk in.  Felt dirty, and old.  We ordered, and we both got a #3.  cost us $18 and change.  There was hardly any one in there, but granted, we were eating out on a Wednesday afternoon at like 4.  I blame going here on being delirious, tired, hot, sweaty and overworked.

I can't say I would never eat here again, but it would be under some pretty rough circumstances."}
{"text":"I have not been,to Fudruckers in a long time. The reason is the poor food, unclean bathroom, the lack of silverware an the overall old look. I hope they start to update the store. I will not return until they do"}
{"text":"Good for the young ones under age 12... And that's about it. The burgers were nothing fancy and my kid, who will usually plow through anything food, was not impressed with the fries. I ordered the sweet potato fries and they weren't all that great. The place was bright and well-maintained. The hostess/cashier was lacking a smile during her shift.  I tried it... I won't return."}
{"text":"I went to Fuddrucker's expecting to repeat experience with that hamburger place from growing up in Houston. I was unaware that it had nosedived to the point that McDonald's is a better alternative. And I hate McDonald's.

Place was dirty, service slow. There was absolutely nothing special about their hamburger buns or ground beef. It would have to improve 100 times over to reach mediocre.

If they hit financial road bumps in the past, they should have just gone out of business. Their brand is now worthless."}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars? They delivered a dry salad with no dressing, a a piece of meat on a dry bun and refused to make the order that I paid for. Terrible, terrible \"service\". Disgusting people."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Fuddruckers because I am a big fan of burgers. This chain is pretty good at what they do.

Burgers: a 7/10 in taste but what do you expect from a chain. The portions are generally large ranging from 1/3 lbs to 1 lb I believe and the smaller of the choices with fries is usually enough for most.

Atmosphere: It is similar to a TGI Fridays, Applebees or Chilis except this Fuddruckers does not have a whole lot of booths which bothers me because if I have a choice between comfortable semiprivate seating and middle of the room on a hard piece of wood I go with the former.

Also this Fuddruckers is not dirty but it is not as clean as I would like.

When I am hunkering for a burger done right this is on the list of options."}
{"text":"Wow what a improvement! Have been back twice (first time back was good) second time very good! Food fast to be ready! Taste excellent quality excellent! Counter people pleasant! I was so happy to have one if my favorite places back on good side of quality!"}
{"text":"Giving 1 star cus i cant give a negative star. Reason being that the cook called an order towards his friends across the floor saying, \"Order up! Two homos!\" I had to do a double take cus i was pretty shocked of what I heard, but he said it a 2nd time and was for sure I heard what he said. When his friend came up, the cook was telling his friend that he was referencing the 2 guys that were waiting for their orders that were before mine. The two guys definitely heard him yell \"2 homos\" and walked away for a sec. I felt super uncomfortable myself, offended, and would've walked away too since our food wasn't out and didn't want a side of spit. Not cool. What's bad is that everyone heard him yell it out....I think ppl at sbarros heard him... I always thought their customer service was poor, but after tonight, it's the worse customer  service I've ever experienced. 

Onto the food... It's expensive and mediocre. Just go to in n out and save yourself money and get better customer service.

PS. I ordered a specialty burger, which I'm sure takes a min to prepare. How come I got my food before the 2 guys got theirs? Little did he know I'm gay myself."}
{"text":"IMO Fuddruckers is THE place to get a burger. I love the fact that you can get buffalo and large size burgers - and that you get to choose and add the toppings yourself. A great place for a tasty lunch or quick dinner out that is real casual and easy."}
{"text":"If you do not like your food here, you have only yourself to blame. They will cook meat to order and you prepare it yourself on buns that are baked daily. The sides are generous in portions and hot. The atmosphere is family friendly and children will enjoy it as much as their parents."}
{"text":"Really enjoy eating here. Food is fresh, dress your burger your way, and lots of condiments.  I like making it my way.  

Friendly staff and coupons often make it easier to come here more often. 

Only negative. Bathrooms are clean but have a mildew type odor.  Perhaps an air freshener that shoots deodorizer scents every 2 mins or so."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent. Sometimes it's great sometimes my medium rare burger comes out raw.

They have really jacked up their prices and reduce the sizes of the burgers.

2/3 combos for example the two thirds burger with three cheeses, is not on the menu anymore."}
{"text":"Pretty decent a bit too much salt but I found out you can say 'no white spice' when you order and they'll hold off.  Overall we really like this chain and it's worth stopping in here if you like a great burger.  We're disappointed that so many have been closed down, if your reading this driving down the highway, check and make sure they're open.  Anyway, consistently good food, fresh condiments and overall good experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Really enjoyed watching the employees actually enjoying interacting with the customers and it appeared they truly loved their jobs!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped for a quick lunch since we were staying at the Orleans hotel. Overall not a bad price. We came when it was slow so our food came out quick. I can see how the condiment area would become quickly crowded. I got the chicken sandwich and it was a good size on the bun. Not a bad stop."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this:  A burger.  A nice, BIG, juicy, fresh, yummy burger at a sit down restaurant that specializes in burgers.  This was going to be my first visit to Fuddruckers and I had high expectations.

Well, eh.

Yeah, it was a burger.  Good but not great.  Not bad, just not exciting.  Nothing special to see here--just a burger.  I thought In n Out tasted a good deal better.  They're a lot cheaper too.

If someone suggests Fuddruckers to me sometime again as a place to eat, I'll go, but if you ask me for a destination if you're looking for a patty between two buns, there are a number of other places that I would suggest instead of it if you gave me the chance."}
{"text":"Love me some Fudd's!!  Medium half pound with Swiss, mustard, bbq sauce, FRESH veggies - chopped onion, dill pickles and shredded lettuce. All on a soft warm house made bun - YUM!!  Usually 2-3 x month for Fri lunch.  NEVER been disappointed."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this restaurant.  My burger was not that tasty and undercooked.  I didn't care for the fries or the cheese you can get with them.  If you are in the Tempe area and want a burger, I recommend that  you go somewhere better such as The Chuckbox or even Habit Burger."}
{"text":"Inside the Orleans Hotel & Casino, in their food court.
Open 24hrs.

I work inside the casino, so it's always nice to get a great hamburger or pick up breakfast right after work.

Breakfast is served 2am-11am.

Tips: Their menu has changed slightly.
Some people have said that their special hamburgers like elk and ostrich have gone up in price.

It can also get hectic during special arena events and lines can get bad.

Some days, not a lot, they close for a few hours for big cleaning times.

Service is always good.

Free beverage refills, also coffee refills when you get the breakfast combos."}
{"text":"Good food, quick service and well kept environment. Kid friendly too with a free kids cookie with the kids meal."}
{"text":"They have the greatest Grilled chicken salad! And you can add things at the burger topping bar, like onions, tomatoes, and pico de gallo.  The whole family loves this place!"}
{"text":"Saturday night, 6/16, 2 employees, very impressive, everything made fresh to order, no one waited for their food more that 6/7 minutes, Simply remarkable!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh stay clear of this Fuddruckers. 
My son & I happened to stop in there this evening & after waiting 18 minutes for our order, which we asked \"to go\", the manager handed us boxes to wrap up our meal to go ourselves.... For a cheeseburger, frings (1/2 fries 1/2 onion rings) & a macaroni & cheese for $15.37 they should have carried the meal out to our car for us. The staff are not very pleasant either with out a single apology for the wait, I know I will not be back, especially when you can come close to having a sit down dinner for that price."}
{"text":"I enjoy stopping by this joint once in a while since they have such a variety of burgers to try from elk, beef, turkey, buffalo, chicken, and more. This time I got the turkey burger on a whole wheat bun with potato wedges. One of the best turkey burgers I have had since it once a ground turkey patty with no grease. I would recommend for those that enjoy a good turkey burger!"}
{"text":"This place is always a treat! The burgers are juicy and the add-your-own-produce section is chilled. I've found that I prefer shredded lettuce over the leaf, and I kinda like pepperoncini's on my burger. A tip to those that are uninitiated... You don't need to spend any extra money adding cheese to your order, because they have dispensers full of hot jalapeno cheese in the condiment section! I am also a huge fan of the fact that they have bottles of Heinz 57 available. IMHO, Heinz 57 is the closest American approximation of Dutch curry ketchup... and it is the ultimate dipping sauce for fries.

The default fries here appear to be potato wedges, which I'm fine with, because they are appropriately crispy. A new wrinkle for me was to order the wedges \"unseasoned\", which has a number of advantages. First, it's the way to go if you're dipping anyway... let's dial the sodium bomb down to a lesser megatonnage. And second, those will be piping hot since they're prepared fresh to order. I don't know if the seasoned ones spend any time sitting, all I know is that the unseasoned ones were freshy-fresh-fresh!

They have the soda machines that offer a kajillion different combinations. I am currently working my way through all of the Fanta Zero options. So, yes, they have tons of diet soda options, which you can use to wash down that 1/2 pound bomber! 
Not that it will make waddling back to your car after such gluttony any easier, but I don't need the sugar. Nonetheless, Fuddrucker's is one of my favorite occasional indulgences...

You got that, right? Fuddrucker burgers near the size of your head should be considered an \"occasional\" food."}
{"text":"I had a great burger experience here and intend to return the next time I am craving a Fuddburger. I also got to introduce a friend to Fuddrucker's for the first time, so it was a cherry-poppin' adventure. Not only are the burgers here tasty, but I love the fact that you get to pick and choose the toppings from their self-serve produce and condiment bars. One of my favorite things on french fries is Heinz 57 sauce and Fuddrucker's is truly awesome for including that amongst its vast condiment selection.

As a professed condiment whore, I was thrilled to discover a new flavor of Tabasco I have never encountered before... and I like to think I really know my Tabasco products, having lived in Louisiana for years. This Fuddruckers special-orders the Sweet & Spicy variety of Tabasco which is not only great on a burger, but would work as an egg-roll dipping sauce. Knowing that I must have it for home use, my dining partner graciously approached the manager who arranged to allow him to purchase a bottle. This was just one example of how efficient, helpful, and friendly the staff here are. Next visit, I will demand to meet the one who refers to himself only as \"Mr. Crusty Baker\" (see photos).

The restaurant also has a lot of shiny fun decor evoking shameless Americana and Route 66 roadside culture. The bright colors and the overindulgence in fast food goodness contributes to a heightened state of arousal that can only be described as a \"Burger Party Contact High\". You can just feel the burger love... the afterglow punctuated by the difficult click of the seat belt as you strap in for a ride back to a somber, less-gluttonous reality."}
{"text":"Friendly helpful staff, big portions at small prices. Fuddruckers has always been a family favorite. Would recommend again and again."}
{"text":"I was in there a few weeks ago, the lady who took my order DENE was horrible....not only did she give me the wrong change but had a terrible attitude and also put in my order wrong not to mention it looked as if she was hungover
If I could give this a negative star I would...what a horrible representation of this place"}
{"text":"Hamburgers here are always done right and the condiment bar is always well stocked and fresh. Dipping fries in the cheese sauce and amazing ranch dressing never gets old. Just signed up for online deals and got my first one within 24 hours."}
{"text":"Had heard of this spot ages ago but never understood how interesting their menu was until my friend casually mentioned their 1lb burgers while passing by... PULL OVE- Screeeech!!

We walk in and immediately I realize that they have not only 1lb beef burgers but exotic meats such as bison, deer and boar. All they are missing is a brontosaurus burger and I'm in heaven. Made a mental note to come back for something fancy and ordered me a 1lb Southwest (?) - contained Pepperjack cheese, guacamole and bacon - fuck yes.

Promptly devoured the entire thing (see action shot posted) and nearly ordered another but my comrade wouldn't take the bet to buy it if I could :(

*Special note: If money is not an issue ($16 burger?) the 'exotic' meats can be stacked to a similar effect.

TL;DR: Highly recommended burger joint for a twist on a simple idea."}
{"text":"Friends from out of town wanted to eat at this place. Since I haven't been here for a while, I thought why not.  Another mistake, this place is filthy. Tables not clean, chair covered with food crumbs, salad area is unkept and littered with old bits. Customer service is just non existence. Patty was dry and rings over cooked. If the dining area is this filthy, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like ! Yuck"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to grab a burger.... I like the rolls, the beef is cooked to desired temperature..  I like the fact that you can make it the way you want with the fixin's bar...  I recommend this place whole heartedly...  They have various meat options for those that want to try something different than just beef...  The milkshakes are good, as well as the baked goods..."}
{"text":"A bit pricey. 4 people  get out of there for $50 , less if you order water or share drinks. I am not a kid but used to order from the kid menu because it's sufficiently sized for me , last time i was there you can't do that. This used to be the pick of the pack. The Arrowhead area has some stiff competition for dining. This location has lost it's identity and pizazz it had before. I would state the name of where I've been going mostly , but don't want to be flagged for being spam. Until there are some major changes I won't be back. 

A few ideas : Lower prices , better arcade , just to start."}
{"text":"I love this fuddruckers. I drive all the way from 75th avenue and cactus to go to this location. I hate the one by my house. Which is why I come here! All the employees are helpful and nice , always a smiling face when I'm there. Plus there are good times and memories I've had there that I won't ever be able to forget. I love this place."}
{"text":"I just love this place. I eat here whenever i can. The freshest ingredients, and the nicest staff."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers.  I have fond memories from the 80s and they are still amazing.  There are so few stores left :(. Great buns, 1/3 medium rare, jalapeño cheese sauce and all the toppings you want.  Thinking of it wants me to go right now!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I can't believe I have never tried FUDDRUCKERS before!

My family and I were starving when we arrived at The New Orleans and decided to check out their food court. We ended up trying Fuddruckers, which was probably the best choice we could have made. :) 

We ordered basic 1/3 cheeseburgers with fries and onion rings. They gave us a beeper to mange the service. The service was actually pretty quick given the demand during that time of day. They don't customize burgers (besides the meat, rare, medium, or well); instead they had a salad bar that was available to customers. The salad bar consisted of red and white onions, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, relish, mayo, ketchup, and mustard. The only problem I had with this setup was that other people had the opportunity to touch the produce. It also made it hard to build my burger with so many people waiting behind me. On a positive note it did save time by not confusing the staff with complex request and they did keep the produce well stocked and fresh.

The burger was awesome, it was flavorful and juicy. The fries were well seasoned but a little chunky for my liking (thick cut). The onion rings were so crispy, in a good way!

Overall
I would love to come back :) I definitely have to find a location near me because they say that they have bucket beers, which sounds like a good time with friends."}
{"text":"The burgers are good enough but way over-priced for a counter service type restaurant. It's a neat place to take the kids though."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner this evening. I ordered the fish & chips and my wife ordered one of their classic burgers...as usual she made the right decision. My fish was OK (fries were very good)...but I can't complain much since I'm originally from Seattle and Fuddruckers is known for burgers...not seafood. My wife said her burger was absolutely delicious (juicy & filling, with a very good bun)! She liked being able to put whatever toppings she wanted on it.

Next time I'll have to get the burger. 4 stars because of the only OK fish and the fact that it took a bit long IMO to get our order. Will likely update the review after our next visit :-)"}
{"text":"Go elsewhere!! The employees are slow and retarded. People that came way after us got their food first. Even after our buzzer went off the food was not ready because they ended up giving it to someone else!!!"}
{"text":"It's an ok place to eat at for burgers, I would recommend to a friend only as a place to eat at once in a life time. So I order a regular 1/3 pound meat burger where I put my own stuff on it like vegetables and etc In total, it was $15+ even after the coupon for but one get one free... Pretty expensive. So after we ordered, we got things like ketchup and there are cheese dispensers, sadly after trying them, they weren't that good. The seating area is more of a dining area, kinda too big and should slim it down to make it not look as abandoned. After getting our burgers, it tasted really good with all the vegetable, kinda lacking flavors honestly. The fries suck honestly, it's required to put on salt and pepper on the fries and dip it in something, not my favorite type of fries honestly.

TLDR: Great Service and OK good also REALLY REALLT EXPENSIVE FOOD, can work on many things but an OK joint overall"}
{"text":"I wondered if they mispelled the name of their restaurant and should've had the f where the r was and the r where the f was.  Something to pnder.  

After long search of what to eat, my stepdad and I ended up here.  He was craving for a veggie-burger and I was just hungry.  It is a little overpriced but I have to admit, I don't mind paying the price of their burgers since the way it's made is unforgettable.  

We ordered our food as if we were in a McDonald's restaurant but the difference is we were given a square gadget that buzzes to let us know our order was ready.  My stepdad ordered the veggie burger with fries and drink, and I ordered the salmon burger with coleslaw and drink.  Every salmon order I've made the past few months have been a disappointment so I had low expectations on this.

Our gadget started buzzing and off we went to get our order as if we were in In&Out Burger.  Now, this is how our food looked; the bun with the salmon/veggie meat on top and the top bun separated.  Fries and coleslaw on the side.  After we took our trays, there was a side bar with all the fixings to add on the burgers:  half chopped lettuc, tomatoes, white onions, red onions, loose leafe lettuce, salsa, pickles, etc.  In another station close by are the sauces like mayonaisse, ketchup, bbq sauce, cheese sauce, etc.

Once we got done getting the side items, we were ready to dig in.  I didn't realize how hot the salmon was so when I bit in to it, I burned my tongue.  But, the burn was oh so worth it.  The salmon was fresh and didn't have that nasty old fish taste.  For the first time in months, I enjoyed salmon.  When combined with mayonaise, lettuce, tomatoe, and red onions, the combination of all gave a an explosion as though being the first night in a honeymoon.  

My stepdad was very impressed with his burger and would like to come back again.  I ordered my boyfriend a 1/3 pounder burger.  He was also very happy with it and said he hasn't had a burger that tasted as awesome as that in a long time.

We'll definintely come back for more."}
{"text":"I love their hamburgers. and the fries, and onion rings.5 times better than In and Out, and Smashburger, and Mcdonalds, etc.
The staff is friendly and helpful.

If you want a great burger, go to fuddruckers."}
{"text":"I have never felt that Fuddruckers burger is anything really that special however I have always loved their ribeye steak sandwich. It is absolutely delicious but for some reason they have taken it off the menu of the Middleton  location. That's very disappointing. That's why I rated at 3. If they had that sandwich on the menu I would give it 5 stars because it's an awesome sandwich."}
{"text":"Not a big fan. The burger patty was well cooked and fresh, but completely under seasoned. The fries are more like baked oven fries. They have skin on, and again deceptively under seasoned. They have visible seasoning on them, but I couldn't taste it. The fried egg on my burger was not even slightly runny, which to me defeats the purpose. The bacon wasn't crispy and the thickness of the meat made it virtually tasteless. The warm cheese sauce, was gelatinous and gloppy, not cheesy or gooey. The condiment bar was dried out. The tomatoes, onions and lettuce all looked dried out and old. They use Heinz products, which is fine for catsup and mustard, but the mayo not so much. I will say it is nice that they offer gluten free buns and the ranch dressing is yummy. For the price, I'll pass. I won't be coming back here, even with a coupon I'm not interested. This place used to be much better. Either my palate has matured or the quality has seriously gone down. Most likely a combination of both."}
{"text":"I love Fudruckers...in general. Certainly not this one. Or at least not this time. They didn't have my order when I arrived. Not that it wasn't done...that too...but the order itself. I payed for it. The  kids were just standing around cooking the heck out of the burgers on the grill asking what order.  Instead of starting a fresh burger they gave me one of the ivercooked ones. I ordered med rare knowing it would be med when I got home. They gave me well done (didn't think I'd check)  and swore it was med rare. I would have asked for another but if they don't know the difference whats the pt. Did I mention it looked like what you'd gwt from McD's? Heck McD's would have been better than this...and certainly would have been less expensive! Don't waste your money...there are so many other places that 'cook to order' that are better. 
:("}
{"text":"Any place that you have to walk up to order your food and not be fully serviced, should not be this expensive; especially a Burger place. There are plenty of restaurants with complete service for the same price. And plenty of burger places that bring a side with the sandwich for that price. Not to mention, the poor cleaning job done on the tables."}
{"text":"Went to super toy con yesterday at the Orleans arena. Decided to eat a quick lunch here so we could get back quickly. So much for quick. 

I ordered the Napa valley salad and my husband ordered a chicken salad. EVERYONE around us was getting their food. My husband went up to check and was told when your pager goes off your food is ready. Duh we know that. 

So I finally went up after waiting 30 MINUTES. 30 freaking minutes for 2 salads. The chick in the back yells THE CHICKEN STILL HAS PINK. Wtf were they doing for so long. It was finally ready and it was delicious food. But there is no reason it should have taken that long."}
{"text":"If you're tired of an ordinary beef burger, you gotta check out this place. They have a variety proteins: chicken, elk, ostrich, bison, wild boar (YUM! that's what I ate).  Served on a healthy wheat bun :)
Plus you can customize your size 1/3, 1/2 or 1# (except the \"exotic meats\" where it only comes in 1/2#). They also have a great burger toppings bar to make your burger extra special! LUV IT!
What woulda have made our experience a 5star? A milk shake.
It seems their machine has been down for several months...Hope to enjoy my burger with a shake next time I visit :)"}
{"text":"Solid burger - they make it the way you ask for it (like, \"medium rare\").  I like all the fixin's at the toppings bar, except I usually order a burger that doesn't take those toppings, so I feel like I'm shorting myself on a benefit.

The mushroom and swiss was very good.  Their burgers are big, which comes at a price.  To add fries and a drink pushes your order up to around $12. We saved 10% by showing we followed on Twitter - which is nice for a party of 3.

The place was clean and the staff were nice. It was pretty quiet when we were there (3pm on a Sunday)."}
{"text":"They opened up a new Fuddruckers in the Orleans food court! Sweet! So if your group can't decide between Fuddruckers, Sbarro, or Subway, you can all be taken care of in one place. 

I do love all Fuddruckers.. the soft buns.. the nasty fake cheese.. AHH.. but now there is even more to love at Fuddruckers! They have sliders (and they are cheap! 2 for $3), but I didn't try those. They also now have an ostrich burger. It's low calorie, low fat, and tastes amazing. I'm not a big turkey burger/buffalo burger/veggie burger fan, so this was a great alternative and allowed me to delude myself into thinking I was \"kind of\" eating healthy for lunch!"}
{"text":"Food is okay but a Lil overpriced.  How do you go from 6.99 sandwich to adding $5 more for fries and a drink?  I could've got a crispy chicken sandwich from jack in the box and still be satisfied."}
{"text":"Holy Moly! Everything that was served here was gigantic! What I liked the most aside from the juicy burgers, was the bread that was fresh, soft, and didn't get mushy or watered down by the juice from the burgers. They serve potatoe wedges and onion rings that are delicious! PLUS! regular and Jalepeno nacho cheese- YUM!! The service was friendly and very helpful! The price is well-worth the product as well! I say check it out and enjoy a variety of excellent tasty burgers ranging from Buffalo, Elk, Ostrich(??) and even Wild Boar. I had a chance to taste the Buffalo- which was just as tasty :D"}
{"text":"The worst burger I have ever tasted in my life.  Very dry and tasteless.   I had never been to Fuddruckers before and I will never be back.  Dirty tables, chairs and overall cleanliness of this restaurant was simply unacceptable.  Manager and cashiers were great, but this does not make a restaurant... food quality and taste is key."}
{"text":"Reasonably good burgers ... very clean environment. Cashier lines get backed quickly. Could improve the order taking by adding additional cashier. Decor doesnt have a theme as other Fuddruckers do. Decent and clean."}
{"text":"There is no better hamburger in town. This place has been around forever for a reason. It's always clean and the food is made to order. The beef is ground daily. Can't get any fresher than that. They have a huge condiment bar too. The kids grilled cheese is so good. You should try the onion rings."}
{"text":"Everything very good. The salad bar is exceptional for the value. Best place to get a fish sandwich in area. Also the fries are very good but be sure to ask for them crisp. They are fat fries not the thin fries served at most other restaurants.  I plan to return soon.  We also enjoyed the bison burger. Good value."}
{"text":"It was good but WAY overpriced. For that reason alone, I wouldn't ever return. We got a half pound burger with onion rings, a 1/3rd lb burger with onion rings, small chili cheese fries (chili wasn't that great) with drinks. It was a whopping $30. All that and we had to clean off our own table and go get our own food. For that price, I'd expect more."}
{"text":"I finally can say I'm a fan! Over time, I've found the best time to come is before 5PM. Over and over again,  the cook  gets it right the first time. As usual, the vegetables are really fresh. A great place to come for a no-hassle burger."}
{"text":"World's Greatest Hamburgers !!  Love all the toppings you can put on. Especially the melted cheese :). Fuddruckers......World's Greatest Hamburgers."}
{"text":"Fudds is a pretty good burger place. Love all of the fresh toppings that you get to choose at the bar.  They also have cheese sauce and jalapeño cheese sauce to dip your fries in that is so yummy. Also they have chili (not green chili but chili chili) that you can get on your burger or on the side. Bacon chili cheeseburger is ver good. Burgers are worth 4 stars but the place is so expensive that overall I give it a 3. We will return but only once in a while."}
{"text":"A lot of $$$ and not a lot of quality!  My partner and I came for dinner tonight after being told it was the worlds greatest hamburger. With high anticipation we ordered the 1/2 lb burger combos and shared a sampler platter...we had an appetite tonight!  Unfortunately the quality did not meet the anticipation. The burgers wet just okay...nothing special. The \"fries\" or as I know them wedges were not good. My partner ordered the chili cheese fries and received wedges with a little chili and some sprinkled cheese. The chili had an odd flavor. 

Needless to say out bill was around $36 and we could have went to a Five Guys Burgers and Fries and had a better experience for about half the price."}
{"text":"First time at fuddruckers cool concept. They have different protein burgers like elk.  They have a condiment station with nacho cheese and sauces galore.  And a fresh veggie bar for your burgers.   

I loved my burger. Onion rings were a bit crunchy. Maybe too crunchy.  Chicken fingers were moist and crisp.  Potato wedges were decent 


Would go here for another burger"}
{"text":"I have visited this location quite a few times. Used to go in, order a few drinks, and then order dinner. Every time I would go outside with my party for a smoke break and come back in our table would get cleared by the servers. We ended up asking for a sign to leave out to eliminate any confusion. 

You order a burger, they cook it, then you add your fixings at a self serve station. They ask if you want to add cheese to your burger for an extra charge but I always say no, then use the free nacho cheese sauce for my burger. Yes, I am cheap, I know this. Their ingredients are very fresh and pretty tasty."}
{"text":"If I could I would give no stars. Walked in about half an hour ago and walked right back out 3 minutes later. There was no hello, how are you,  be with you in a sec, be right there, nothing. Out of all 5 employees behind the counter, not a single one even looked at us. We stood there and stood and stood while they all went on about their business (other than us). Near the end of our very short visit we decided to count to 10 very slowly in hopes we weren't being ignored, nope. So we left and went right next door to Aranya Thai Bistro and had a fabulous meal. Give it a try if Thai is your thing! :)"}
{"text":"Great burgers, nice staff , no complaints here. It's of the freeway access road so it can be tough to get to. Other than that. It's good."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to a Fuddruckers in probably 20 years and decided to go in yesterday. The girl working the counter was very nice and helped explain the menu a bit. The food was pretty good. It wasn't the best burger I've had but it wasn't the worst. The fries and shake were excellent. I don't really have any complaints, the burger just didn't blow my shorts up. I'll probably hit them up again."}
{"text":"This is an old back east favorite for me so I was excited to find out there are a couple of locations in the valley. 

Fuddruckers' claim to fame are their fresh, never frozen burgers.  Choose your size; tell them how you want it cooked; receive it with a sesame seed bun (which are baked fresh in the restaurant daily); make it your own at the fixin' bar and you have yourself one darn good burger!  And they have deliciously seasoned wedge-cut fries to boot.  

They grill up your burger and call your name when the food is ready.  It's pretty quick for a fresh burger made when it's ordered.  

You can accompany your burger creation with a milk shake and for dessert they offer cookies and brownies.  Great place to bring the little ones - they eat free on Tuesday evenings.  

Definitely won't say this is the healthiest lunch or dinner you'll eat but if you're in the mood for a reliably good burger and some great fries I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"$29 for a 1/2 lb chilli burger, 1/3 lb south west burger, two drinks and chili cheese fries. I love the idea of adding my toppings. The burgers are really good but don't taste like a grilled burger. The chili on the burger and fries is the same and taste like canned chili...something like bunker hill style. The tables were kinda dirty abd I had to wipe ours down. But over all the decor is nice and fun with games and lots if tv's."}
{"text":"Always spot on with delicious burgers and shakes; can't go wrong with this chain restaurant. However I am not a fan of carpeted floors where food crumbs, etc can gather. Although other reviewers have much more negative feedback about this issue and bugs, I have not experienced such problems and it may be due to I tend to dine here either before or after the lunch crowd.  

As Arnold the Govinator said \"I'll be back\"..."}
{"text":"Hard to find a better burger. The toppings are fresh and you get to put them on yourself so none of that false advertising like from other burger shops that show everything nicely placed and large pieces and what you actually get is half a pickle, a portion of a slice of an onion and it all slid off to 1 side."}
{"text":"Not great! I dined here recently and it basically sucks. The service is terrible and rude. They told me they were out of cheddar cheese!? What? And FYI to those that care they now charge for ranch-which I'm pretty sure she pocketed as a tip! 

No good. Don't go!"}
{"text":"The burgers are not bad but a bit pricey for a burger drink and fries being $11 for the lowest price burger. What's nice is they have a condiment bar so you can help yourself to tomatoes, pickles, lettuce etc etc."}
{"text":"Went to a family event at Fuddruckers this week. Have a relative who digs it. Going there just gives me the willies. 

It definitely seems to have been cleaned up a bit from the last time we went. It was dirty, nasty the previous time. Little bit of solace in that. DIdn't seem as dirty. They'd reupholstered the booths with the torn vinyl. They'd gotten rid of the cracked & torn vinyl red & white striped tablecloths. Still cracked & old formica but it didn't seem as dirty.

As far as the food, I got a bacon cheeseburger that was just not very good. Ok, but nothing special at all. The fries weren't great either. In years past, I was a big fan of the plastic cheese in the heated cheese fountain but not so much either. After it cools a bit, it's just nasty.

I will go back when future family events require & maybe with less trepidation but I still wouldn't go there by choice with other good options nearby."}
{"text":"Options in meat is the main reason to come to Fuddruckers. The availability of elk, buffalo, ostrich, wild boar, salmon, and the run of the mill beef are the choices. The establishment is built on a fast food counter ordering system with sit down style prices. The protein looks to come in 1/2lb patties. The Elk ($9.99) was lean, juicy, and not gamey. The Buffalo ($9.99), on the other hand, is not to be ordered if you are turned off by that taste. Burgers are sold alone. Fries, onion rings, and a mixture of the two are sold separately. 

After ordering the hot items, the choices of cold items and sauces are displayed in a salad bar fashion. Toppings were fresh, crisp, and kept clean. My sister and I both got our burgers without a bun and the availability of whole leaf lettuce allowed us to make our meal protein style. 

Overall, I like the wide variety of wild game, but it was not the best version I have ever had."}
{"text":"The first time I had Fuddruckers was in New Mexico and thought it was pretty good. So I didn't mind when my hubby said he wanted to go again and get one of their Wild Boar burgers.
We placed our orders, the cashier was friendly and helpful, my husband asked if he could get the Boar burger on a regular bun since it comes with a whole wheat bun, and skip the coleslaw, she said no problem.
The wait wasn't too bad. Well my husbands Boar burger was on a wheat bun, they did skip the coleslaw so he dealt with it. For a burger priced $9.99 it was pretty small and it doesn't come with anything. He thought it was dry and pretty bland. I got the 1/3 LB. Burger combo. My burger was also bland but it was juicy. The wedge fries that comes in the combo would've been better if they were crispier. The topping bar is kind of annoying, they should have plates available so you could get your fixings before you get your burger. When your standing there waiting for Gramps to decide what he wants, your burger and fries are getting cold. Then I get to the condiment station and half the pumps are empty, and I know I heard another customer telling them they needed to be filled while we were waiting for our burgers.
Poorly run restaurant, The food is way over priced for the quality and quantity that you receive. I will never return to this location. Not sure if I'll waste my time with a Fuddruckers again."}
{"text":"I am not one to write reviews usually but the service was so poor and the response of management to the issues so underwhelming that I had to write a review.

Sad but this restaurant is NOT ready for prime time. they have tried to take the Fuddruckers formula private. This is the same owners as the previous Fuddruckers at the same location. the Fuddruckers franchise has declared bankruptcy earlier so the owner or owners have tried to go private with the restaurant.

here in lies the problem. I am guessing the wait staff is not trained for sit down type guest ... as the old style was order your food, and they call your number, get your burger, and add your own fixings.
now with sit down service and wait staff to bring you your food it is not that simple guys! you have to provide customer service or I would just go to a fast food restaurant (and by the way I will definitely be going to a fast food burger location instead of here ... They have 100% better service (sigh))...

What is bottom less drinks and bottom less fries (when you charge for them) if the wait staff does not come by and ask you if you want refills and remind you its free refills for both fries and drinks! then on top of that the area of the restaurant we were seated in was very dark. you could see the track lighting track is there but there were no light fixtures installed on the track (duh).

now it is strange when you have a party of friends and the friend who arrived latest and ordered about 10 mins after the others gets his food first ... then another group of us and then the final two about 30 mins later! ok so you have problems with chefs but that should not affect the order the meals arrive should it? this points to what the other reviewer have implied or said you have issues with your computer order system or training with the wait staff entering orders, or the printers in the kitchen to issue the orders to the chefs! fix it guys... do you have a Sous Chef? Is he or she asleep at the wheel.
ok to keep adding fuel to the fire... we finally have to talk to the manager.... and his explanation does not answer why the food is late and his response of being sorry was followed up by 20% off our food tab when the last two people should have at a MIN been free or at least 50% off ...

So lets see about why I go out to eat at a restaurant:
1. Atmosphere = FAIL 0 out of 10. No lighting, the place was very cold and it seemed like they did not have the HVAC heating balanced as the other part of the restaurant was warm. The Bar Area was like a freezer
2. Service = FAIL 3 out 10. At least he took our order and it arrived. that is it. no follow up on drinks, fries, or how is your food? Request for manager did NOT get results. had to find manager on my own.
3. Food = FAIL 4 out 5. The burgers were not special and the buns should be warmed or slightly toasted. The waiter did not ask what we wanted on our burgers. No Cheese was on the side when arrived. The Salad Bar is small and poorly stocked compared to most any restaurant in the Waterfront.

Management had as they call it \"a moment of truth\" to say hey we screwed up and we want to make it right...
other restaurants that I would go back to after an issue like this, the manager at that location admitted they were wrong, gave us 1/2 off our food and free dessert and owned the issue.
This manager did not. he said he was sorry but did not sound sincere and I walked away feeling that the 20% was more of an insult then a real apology. He also said he would give us managers return card of some sort (again failed as we never received it with our bill). bottom line is it sounded like he has been through the scene that unfolded a dozen times and had a standard excuse and response. that is sad...

this other restaurant that they did the RIGHT thing was Grand Concourse Station Square... takes lessons guys and you guys are not even charging as much for your meals.
I am guessing this place could qualify as a place for the worst of the TV series Hell's Kitchen..."}
{"text":"This place is open 24 hours a day in the casino and can be pricey depending on what burger you order.  They have some exotic meats and toppings but I just went with the regular 1/3 pound burger with fries and a drink and it hit the spot for about 10 bucks total.  The size was filling and the fries were delicious.  The best part was the little 'salad/topping' bar where you can fix up your burger however you want.  I loaded mine with a ton of salad, tomatoes, onions, relish, pickes....you get the idea.  My sister went with the grilled chicken salad and said it was very decent.  This is Food Court burger place after all so don't expect some fancy gourmet feast but for a regular and fast burger, it does quite well.  We went at about 1:30am when TGIF in the same casino kindly kicked us out since it was close to closing time.  I recently went to a Red Robin and I have to say, the burgers are pretty equivalent in size and quality to this Fuddruckers.  If I'm in the area again, I would definitely return for a late night meal."}
{"text":"Build your own burger place, you pay to add on, if you don't like the burger then it was you own fault for picking the wrong items.  I thought it was fresh and burger was good well, just like it should be.

With the extras and our drinks, it was a bit pricey for a burger.  But it ranks up there with other similar establishments.  A fine burger place."}
{"text":"Yeah ok I will squeeze a 4 star but actually wish there were a 3.5 star rating. This place is good....onion rings are better than their fries. Condiments are free which includes cheese....this is what pushed it to the 4 stars. Kids burger is worth it - but not Mac n Cheese (it's just boxed Kraft).  The Fudd's in Cali have the coke machine with like a million flavors...this one does not :-/
Kids Eat Free with purchase of an adult meal (so you have to get the combo...so avg meal is about $13).  Taste is where it just goes kinda average for me. The meat is very bland...no real flavor. Still not bad if you get the kids eat free meals to offset your combo price."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked burgers! Nice, friendly customer service with tons of different burger toppings! Good onion rings too! :)"}
{"text":"Went to Fuddruckers today.  Service and food was great as usual.  BUT I went to the restroom to wash up and found that only one stall was open and it wasn't the handicapped one.  I waited for use in the other one and it was occupied by one of the staff who left without washing her hands.  After using the facilities, I tried to wash up, I noticed that the sinks were dirty.  I applied soap and couldn't rinse.  There was no running water in either basin.  The paper towel dispenser was a hit or miss, not working properly.  I actually went out to the soda dispenser and got ice & paper towels from a table and rinsed the soap off my hands before I left.  Inexcusable!"}
{"text":"The food is always really good. But the other night when we were there service was not their best. Waited 35 minutes for food but it was still yummy! We will go back!!!"}
{"text":"Let me just that  Fuddruckers is the best burger joint in Houston and it saddens me to know that the lack of good beef hinders it's elsewhere in the U.S. I had a burger here and at burger bar and let me say that both places had sub-par beef to begin with which is the whole reason to go to either one of the restaurants. 

The beef tasted different and lacked fulling flavorful and the mouth watering taste that I experience at every other  Fuddruckers I have even been to (in Texas) and it makes me sad that my friend who lives in Vegas had to taste this sub-par burger. 

Would I eat here or recommend this place to anyone. No.

Do I recommend  Fuddruckers in Texas? Absolutely without a doubt the best burger you will EVER have."}
{"text":"Apparently the original name was Fuckrudder's but for some reason that didn't take off. So a few multi million dollar advertising meetings later, waaa laa, Fuddrucker's. Ahhh, c'mon, it's still fun to say. Now, is it fun to eat here? Well, back in it's hey day, I thought it was pretty fun. Design your own burger. Grab a beer. Chow down. However, the last time I ate at Fuddrucker's, it was a sad sight. The \"burger bar\" was a disaster. Nothing really interesting for toppings. Except for the artificial nacho cheese sauce perhaps. And what was there was picked over like the last bologna wrapped pickle at a trailer park picnic. And speaking of trailer parks, even though this particular Fuckrudder's, ooops, er um, I mean Fuddrucker's is in tony Scottsdale, the clientele was, was, well they scared me."}
{"text":"The food was good and came out fairly quick, the only issues was the service and beverage station. My burger was done and sitting on their service table for a few minutes before I went and asked if my number was ready and it was just wasn't ever called.  When I went to get my beverage, the brewed tea was completely empty and when I asked to have it filled, the staff took 10 minutes before they came out. After I finally got my drink, my food, and table, the meal was enjoyable. Some rough edges but still a decent eatery."}
{"text":"I would give fuddruckers 4 stars, but the service at this one is outstanding! Adrian was informative and super friendly, accommodating, and honest. The Guy grilling the burgers did a great job and was also freindly and engaging. Even the dude that wiped our table was super nice."}
{"text":"Okay so Fuddruckers... I like several things about this place. The food is really good. The jalapeno cheese sauce is truly amazing and burgers are yummy.

But here's the downside unfortunately I've eaten here three separate times. The price is kinda expensive, which I look past for good food. The service wasn't that impressive. But here's the real kick to a restaurant that I enjoy the food, Is I've gotten food poisoning all three times. That's enough to scare me off from here. I chalked the first time up to a pretty rare hamburger. the second time was maybe dumb luck because the burger that time was well. But on my third visit I'm blaming the restaurant because this is pretty impressive on how I get ill every time I eat here. Worst of all it was not just me. 

Now I don't have a weak stomach by any means and your food is really good. But I'm not sure what it is and why I get food poisoning every time I come here. But it's probably a issue with your level of sanitation. My guess.

My advice to anyone who reads this, be careful. The food is good. But you're probably going to shit and pule your brains out for a day or so."}
{"text":"Ridiculous prices. Seriously. For anything, not just a veggie burger.
Oh, and that veggie burger? A Boca burger that has been heated in a microwave. 
The seating? It is a casino, so really, there is none other than the plastic chairs you can manage to wrangle away from teenagers. 
The time you wait for your food is a joke, especially when there is NO ONE else around. I would understand if it was a juicy, homemade patty, thick and full of really good seasonings. But no. The time you wait is the time it takes it to thaw out and be cooked. Do not kid yourself into thinking they are hand forming your food back there. 
The only redeeming quality this place has is the all you can take condiments bar- but even that is sullied by the fact that it is a total free for all that is not even monitored! I do not want tomato slices after the man in front of me fingered the tongs and threw it into the food. Ew. And the kids? Don't even think about what they do. It will make you cringe. I like the idea, really I do, but it cannot be just left off to the side where no one is making sure that the food is being replenished, and untainted."}
{"text":"deserving of 5 stars for the following reasons...


1)Custom make your own burger 
2) They make their own bread daily
3) Fresh ingredients you can choose and put on yourself 
5)The variety in their \" sauce bar\"
6)The onion rings 
7) The order and seat yourself thing- i likey

Fuddruckers fudding rocks!"}
{"text":"Fuddruckers, the worlds greatest hamburgers....Yeah, sorry, not even close.

I ordered the works burger 1/2lb variety with an egg...So burger, bacon, cheese, mushrooms and egg.

Somehow manged to not put the mushrooms on the burger, a quick trip up to the counter and a side of mushrooms were given, ok not a real issue, crap happens.

So the burger, yeah I guess it's ok, nothing amazing, up there with the Fatburgers of the world, certainly no \"The Worlds greatest burger\" by any means.

Is it worth going out of your way for, not really, but if you are there I wouldn't say don't go, hence the 3 stars, nothing wrong with it, nothing great about it."}
{"text":"Thursday special,  grilled chicken sandwich,  wedge fries and soda.  Buy one combo get one free.  Makes for a great date night!  Very nice and clean.  Service wonderful.  Lost a star for the music. Food was awesome as usual.  When your fries stay hot through out the meal that rocks!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience at both locations. The food is great, menu options are excellent.  If you don't want a burger they have salads.  Great toppings and they are so fresh and they have ranch as a side for dipping or adding to the bun. Love it!!!!  Oh and the RICE CRISPY TREATS are the bomb.  I always have to get at least 3 when leaving. Yum Yum."}
{"text":"So... I ordered a salad. The avocados didn't look the \"healthiest\". The manager was kind and switched them out. Then I realized the lettuce in my salad had at one point been frozen. I didn't finish it. And I didn't complain because, quite frankly, I don't like spit in my food. 

So, why did I give them four stars?

BECAUSE... my husband and son. Their food was amazing. They both ordered burgers. And a very delicious milkshake.

AND... when the manager came around to pick up our dishes he noticed I didn't eat my salad. We had a very small and polite conversation. He apologized and very graciously offered our money back which I thankfully accepted.

I would 100% absolutely go back. AND... I know, with all my heart, this would not be an establishment that would ever spit in anyone's food. ^_~"}
{"text":"With celebrity chefs falling all over one another to open burger concept restaurants, it may be surprising that a casino food court counter-service burger would rate so highly.

But \"Fuddy's\" (as my brothers called it growing up) remains one of my burger go-tos - along with In-N-Out, of course. It's far superior to the conceptually similar Fatburger.

The housemade buns stand up well to the meat - my biggest beef with a lot of these boutique burger places (no pun intended) is that the grease from the burger soaks through the bun, rendering the whole thing a sloppy mess. But I can get this to go, take it home, and eat an intact burger if I choose to.

They offer meats like ostrich, elk, wild boar, etc. for the adventurous - but what I always wondered was how they sold enough of it to keep a fresh supply on hand. So I just stick to the beef...

Although the potato wedges are a must. Sometimes I'll just get an order of wedges, smother them in cheese, pico, shredded lettuce and jalapenos, and voila - nacho fries!

Bonus points for being open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Fun, fun and more fun.  Large selection in how you want your burger.   Plus build your own(top it the way you want).  Food is good !!!!

Plenty of seating and tvs that can be viewed from just about any where within the dinning area.    

Employees are professional and take pride in their customers experience.   

If your in the mood for a burger, stop by.  The wait for a fresh one is worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place after playing poker and let's just say I did not expect how delicious and fresh it was! We got the World's Greatest Burger or something like that and we get to top it off with what we want. The onion rings were bomb and so were the fries. 

The lady that took our order was also kind enough to ask us if we wanted our burger cut in half since we were sharing it. (We didn't know if we were going to like it) but next time we know for sure how it tastes so we would be getting our own burgers lol

And to the people who complain about their burgers.. Who the hell eats their burger well cooked??  anyways, I would definitely eat here again !! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have really delicious fries and sweet poatato fries. I am currently a vegetarian, and love that they have a veggie burger and I can load it with all the toppings I want. I've eaten their other burgers too, and they are so yummy. The decor is casual and fun, and all the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Busy today, and it showed throughout the restaurant. Out of ice. Out of silverware. Out of ketchup. Out of cups. Almost every table was dirty with dishes and food. There were approximately 5 families in the restaurant when we arrived. 

Food was ok, but cheese was cold. It took quite a while to get to us. Overall disappointing, expensive lunch. There was only one trash can in the restaurant and it was full. Strange visit for sure."}
{"text":"I love Fuddruckers because I can put my own toppings on including gooey, melty fake cheese!  Also, they have frings (a combo of fries and onion rings).  Very tasty."}
{"text":"Well i didn't like it that much, i was very excited to eat an ostrich burger and a elk burger because i never had them before and don't know about any other places in Vegas that sell them. so i did and i was not satisfied at all it was very dry, either the person who cooked it didn't know how to cook it right or it just wasn't good. Any ways my friend told me the regular burgers were better than the gamy meats. And the salmon burger was OK too. I probably wouldn't go there again cuz 13 bucks for a tiny ostrich burger that wasn't even good with fries and a drink almost 20."}
{"text":"So I went here this past Saturday with my  man because I had a coupon for a free 1/3 lb burger with the purchase of an equal or greater..... So guess what! Here I am writing about it. It was an extra $1 per topping, and I got pepperjack cheese, guacamole, and bacon. I ended up eating the bacon separate from the burger. He got a  1/2 lb. bbq bacon burger. The sauce they put on it was good (i tried some) Wow. The sweet potato fries that I got were great! The only ting  better than them were the sweet potato tots from Papa Joe's. But even those weren't that far ahead of these. Dipped in a little bit of ranch and yum. So they have this bar full of condiments that you can put on your burger. I got some pico de gallo. Seriously more places should do that. Also they had a Coke machine with the million different flavors.... we got Vanilla Root Beer, Vanilla Sprite, and Grape Mellow Yellow. He got a cookie from the bakery stand they have in there and it was pretty good too."}
{"text":"This is my kids request for every birthday meal. I love it because it's the only place I've found that you can get a fresh turkey burger rather than a frozen Patty. The toppings bar is really great. Love to put the pico de gallo, pickles, mayo and cheese sauce on my burger. The staff is always friendly, the orders come up quickly. Great restaurant to take the family to."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch and we were the only people in here which I thought was strange because I remember this restaurant being very crowded a few years ago. They are over priced and that is why I order the kids cheeseburger it is a good size and you get fries a drink and cookie. And it is very cheap in comparison to regular sized burgers, our total was around $10.

I just glanced at the reviews while waiting for food, didn't read them though, so when I got home and read that the cooks are being unsanitary and that people saw cockroaches- I was pretty disturbed. **I personally did not see any of that but it's pretty obvious that many people have witness it. That being said I wouldn't recommend going here."}
{"text":"I rarely eat hamburgers but my wife was starving and we were in the area so why not?  I've always had a Fuddruckers nearby wherever I have lived but had never actually stepped inside of one til this time.  I wasn't expecting much.  

My wife got the three cheese 1/2 lb burger which was probably one of the juiciest burgers I had ever tasted.  Huge!!  We were both glad we didn't order fries.  I ordered the ostrich burger which was less juicy but still very tasty.  

They also had 1 pound burgers available w/ an even bigger bun for it.  We probably could've ordered that and split it I guess.  Didn't actually get to see anyone inhale one of those but it would've been amusing.  

I also liked the condiments/toppings stations they offered.  All the veggies were pretty fresh.  I was also thinking people could really get away w/ making their own salad here accompany their burger.  I guess they could just smuggle some dressing in or something.  

My wife loved this place.  We'll be back if we're around the area again."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich is a joke. Size of a kids burger and horrible value.  Might have to order two of these.  Thumbs down this time."}
{"text":"My tip for this place is to try the chicken sandwich! Its damn big and one of the best I have tried. Its nice adding your own toppings and making it your own creation. I havent actually had a burger here in years but i do remember them being ok."}
{"text":"Ow! My stomach hurts....1/2 lb southwestern burger.
A bit too big with the added fries. I thought I was hungrier. Ok meal, but a little pricey for just OK."}
{"text":"I love the hamburgers there always fresh. If you get a drink you can use the cup and get refills for 24 hours which is great if your staying at the casino and saves money. I always make sure and fill up on all the vegetables when I get my burger you can almost make a salad."}
{"text":"Very average food.  If you are looking for an overpriced so-so burger joint, then this is the place.  Nothing to write home about.  I won't be back.  The fries were small and overcooked."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast burritos. They were good. But when my son-in-law unwrapped his, there was a piece of plastic sticking out... He unrolled the burrito and inside was a food handlers glove!!! Needless to say, he didn't get to eat his burrito on the ride home. Didn't the cook notice he lost a glove?"}
{"text":"Awful, absolutely awful.  Purchased a buffalo chicken sandwich and burger with a side of fries and a drink.   After waiting 10 minutes, I expected food to be hot, but instead the sandwiches were cold and the fries were barely warm.  25 dollars later, I won't be back.  I seriously had a better chicken sandwich at McDonalds and far cheaper."}
{"text":"Hands down amazing. The burger was cooked perfectly to what I asked for and it was made in a good amount of time. Highly impressed with the work they do here. Great atmosphere to be in, kind staff and awesome food. Try the 1/2 lbs three cheese !"}
{"text":"Fun place. Had a great time with my family. I like building burgers any way I like."}
{"text":"Yelp makes you give a place at least one star, I wish I could give this place less. Fuddruckers is a hole. I lost a bet with a friend and had to buy him lunch, he chose  Fuddruckers. We walk In and I order the least damaging thing I could put in my body, a salmon burger. I notice they have whole grain buns so I ask for that with grilled onions. My friend orders the one pound burger because anytime someone else is buying he always gets the most expensive item or biggest on the menu. So we sit down and I'm wondering why my bill was 32 bucks for lunch. Then I see this rip off burger joint charges 50 cents extra for whole grain buns, 85 cents for grilled onions and 4 bucks for endless sodas. He ordered fries which are also extra. 32 bucks for lunch?!?! For burgers?!? My salmon burger was ok, moist and flavorful, unfortunately the grilled onions made the bun soft and it fell apart so I ate it with a fork. His burger was cooked to order and flavorful, he said. The fries were nothing special. Overall I think you can get better burgers elsewhere, and not have to shell out almost 35 bucks for them. This was my first and last visit to Fuddruckers. They can go Fudd themselves!"}
{"text":"Another fast food place that's open way early in the morning inside the Orleans Hotel. I don't care for Fuddruckers burgers but when you have a nice breakfast menu on tap, you're golden in my books!

Their mini breakfast sliders are actually pretty good! When you're headed out in the mornings for whatever occasion it may be, you can grab one of their sliders to go. They come out steaming hot and fresh and will hit the spot (We had the egg, cheese and sausage sliders). It takes a couple of minutes for the cooks to make for you but well worth it. I didn't have anything else though. Strictly breakfast review here. The early morning crew are nice also. I think this place is 24 hours and if I remember the cashier was there since 3am!"}
{"text":"This is the first Fuddruckers in which I have dined that wasn't packed for dinner.  I never have trouble getting a seat and the staff is always friendly and quick. I have been eating at fuddruckers since 1985 or so when all they offered were burgers and the meat hung in a freezer at the door.  All you could put on the burgers was cheese and lettuce fixins. I remember the meet seemed fresher and bigger then.  The buns seem to be new and that is an improvement.  Not the best burger I ever had but more than serviceable and now there are many more choices including ELK, Buffalo, Ostrich, etc.  They offer toppings now including Mushrooms and bacon and different cheeses.  This is not a dieter's friend.  

The food is good, not great, the sides forgettable.  The cookies are tasty but the rest of the deserts are to be avoided.

Great place for the kids!"}
{"text":"Burgers aren't usually my first choice when it's my turn to pick the restaurant... but this!! I love coming here to create a custom burger. You order your burger with or without cheese & bacon & then head to the topping bar for a huge selection of toppings & condiments. The burgers taste GREAT & I usually only eat half & have some left for later."}
{"text":"I'm pretty skeptical when it comes to anything buffet style but this was an unexpected treat... I still don't like the fact that you have to go to a little bar to put condiments on your burger but it is what it is and their burgers are really good! They have a pretty good menu for a burger place. I've never had bad service here it's pretty straight forward and if it's your first time they explain how it works which is always nice."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Customer Service!
I am the VP of Operations for a major chain hotel, with that being said customer service is critical to how I view a business and if I would return. I came here tonight for a meeting and was impressed with Tina and the other staff working the evening shift. Very friendly, helpful and conversational.  You get quite a bit of food for the price and it was prepared fast and tasted great.
I would absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The bathrooms are excessively dirty and the staff extremely rude. the mayonnaise and cheese containers are empty"}
{"text":"Although I try not to eat burgers all the time, don't get it twisted, I love them...just not the aftermath.  So I heard this place had ostrich, buffalo and elk burgers.  My eyes got hella big and knew that I had to bucket list (book Mark) this joint.

At first, I thought this place was a party Favors store our something, not knowing it wad a restaurant.  Derrr....  Finally, I learned that this place is a strict burger joint that prides themselves on their unique menu.  

Unfortunately, the ostrich burger was out, but the buffalo and elk burgers were available.  I opted with the elk since I assumed that it was harder to come by, let alone all the rave reviews by fellow Yelpers.  

To my surprise, the burger was not as gamey as everyone makes it out to be, in fact, it did not not distinctly different imo.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but for the upcharge, not sure if the meal was worth it.  The plus is that good ol' Elmer Fuddrucker offers both onion rings and potato wedges as a combo for no extra charge.

Otherwise, I would have to wait for when the ostrich is available to give them a chance on redemption.  The service is decent, nothing spectacular and the staff is friendly, but overall, issss aiiight.

So till next time, I'll let y'all know if they got me back on board with the ostrich.  Wonder if they serve manatee out elephant burgers.  I can already see Chic Fil a commercials in my head.  Even my write up is mediocre since the place didn't wow me that much.  I did get full of a third, okay, I'm reaching for positives now, I'm out!"}
{"text":"this is supposed to be the \"world's greatest handburgers\"
i wasn't pleased. 

so i came here thinking it was a sit down restaurant, and boy was i wrong. 
you walk in through the doors, and wait in line. when it's your turn, you order. 
and ordering is a hassle. maybe i'm too asian to figure out how to freaking order a burger, but i thought it was a bit challenging. 
then they give you a buzzer thingy that lights up. 
now you have to find a place to sit. 
OH MY GOSH, what a pain! you have to stake out a table and try to anticipate who's going to be done with their meal first and jump on it. 
when your food is ready, you go up to get it, and then you have to put your own lettece and tomato on it. [it's kinda like a buffet line] i give them extra kudos for making sure it was fresh, because the veggies DID look very very very fresh. 
then you finally sit down and get to eat. not in peace though, because others are waiting for your table. 

i ended up paying $10 for a 1/3lb burger and wedges. they charged me extra for my grilled onions and guac. 
i think it's WAYYYYY overpriced for all the hassle i had to go through. you don't even pay that much at a sit down restaurant. 

yeah, the burgers were good, i guess. but i would never go back. 
might as well go to IN-n-OUT and enjoy my meal for under $5 [which includes a drink]"}
{"text":"the fries are to die for I would recommend signing up for the VIP club you get lots of exclusive offers like buy one get one free sometimes is at exclusive locations however if you give the location you're going to the information they'll be more than happy to use it and tell you what options you"}
{"text":"Gosh, I hope this place is not going down hill. We went today at 2:45 pm. Super dirty. not a clean table in the place!1. Asked to have table cleaned and she said yes he would do that as soon as he fills the ice machine!! Onion rings were cold. 2 seeds on top of bun. Two forks is holders and no knifes! Come on...you had that big a rush at noon on a Monday? Sure hope they get better real soon."}
{"text":"Came in today (3/2 at 7pm)and it wasn't busy. So it took 5 minutes to order our food. Wait time for our food was approx 15 minutes. We ordered 2 bourbon burgers and 2 kids meals. Total was $32. Which is reasonable for me. 

I ordered my burger well done and my husband ordered his medium-well, both were made correctly. 

When we first got our meal I noticed our burger didn't have the bacon on it, which we paid additional for. The worker at the same time passed by our table and overheard us. He was so kind and approached us very sincerely. He took our burger and brought it back correct. He was a busser but went beyond that title. Checked up on us again afterward. I asked his name and he said his name was Danny. Someone shake his hand because he knows how to give customer service 100%!.

At first I didn't really want to order a combo because it's an additional 4.50 so for a bourbon meal it was approx $13. But when the fries came then I understood why. Fries were very well made. Not greasy at all. And seasoned nicely. 

Overall experience was a 5/5. And will be returning again soon"}
{"text":"Fuddruckers is amazing. I don't know how its not more popular. The meat and the bun is really what sets this place apart. The meat always has a wonderful beef flavor. The bun its fresh baked and toasted to perfection. They give you the perfect canvas. To make the burger artfully yours. 

I love fuddruckers so much."}
{"text":"fuddruckers is the best burger for a chain restaurant. their buns are always fresh l. their meet is the best. they also have all the best condiments to make it just the way you like it. everyone should go to fuddruckers more l. i love them so much"}
{"text":"I had a buffalo burger, the wife had a salmon burger and the kid had a kid's burger combo. All were rock solid or better. Quick turn around and nice servers. - Update, the kid wanted to go back the next day for lunch and since we were in the area, we obliged. Guess what? Yep, the food was even better...I'd go 4 1/2. Also nice to see that the condiment bar was neat and clean once again even with a crowd. A great place for a burger!"}
{"text":"Just got back from lunch, and I am just not enjoying this place as much as I used to. 

I will start with the meh:

First off, they raised the prices and took away the union discount. That bugged me a little, to have a discount for union members and then just take it away. Bah! Also, it was $40 for lunch, 3 burgers, fries and drinks, and that just seems high to me, especially since you can get a cheaper lunch at nearby places (Custom Built or Five Guys are great) Really for a place where you order at a counter and grab your own food when it is done, I do not expect to pay $40 for lunch. The place was pretty empty compared to how I remember it from before, so maybe other people feel the same?

On to the good:

The food was very good. We all enjoyed the burgers and fries and the toppings bar is always fun. The employees working that day were super nice and attentive. 

If I was rating just the food and employees I would give it 5 stars for sure, but the high price and no more union discount irritates me enough to drop 2 stars."}
{"text":"My daughter called them to see if they sell their hotdog buns. She was told yes by the girl who answered the phone.  I drove all the way over there to buy 4, yes only 4, buns and they wouldn't sell them to me.  I would have had to give 24 hours notice. Ridiculous. Why weren't we told that on our initial call. Horrible customer care. Won't be back for ANYTHING from this place until they change to honest management.

So I'm the daughter who made the \"initial\" phone call. I've worked in the food service industry for 10 years.  Never in my life would I allow a customer to walk out the door empty handed after one of my employees told that customer that they could place that \"to go\" order. The employee who answered the phone actually placed me on hold to ask the manager on duty (aug 31st) if they took orders to go for their hotdog buns, she returned to the call and told me \"yes we sell our buns to go\" me replying \"ok I'm on my way I'll see you soon\" and the employee responding \"ok I'll see you soon\" After making the 20min drive (40min round trip) we were told that they would not sell us any buns because they didn't have enough for dinner, this was after watching the manager pull down a tray of 10+ buns and returning to us then saying they only had two buns and would not sell us any. After explaining the situation even further the manager became extremely rude and somewhat hostile. I will be taking this issue to corporate bc of the EXTREME unprofessionalism. 


See photo::
We ended up going to Frys (no joke) they had the same buns. All you need to do is ask the bakery (who is fabulous mind you) and they will guide you to these buns. Just spread a little butter on the outside edges and toast them like you would a grilled cheese sandwich. 
Our goal tonight was \"clam boats\". You butter and toast up the bread filled then with clam strips, coleslaw and a garlic aioli!! Yum yum and you have a clam boat. 
Avoid the headache and poor customer service and head over to Fry's two blocks away. Their bakery and customer service is like sipping a pina colada on a tropical sunny beach.. and you don't need 24hrs notice! 
Also noted we put 8oz of clams strips in these buns and they could have held 12oz easily!"}
{"text":"first time i ate here and i loved it! i ate here twice during my lv stay, the first time i had the bison burger and the next time i believe we had the elk burger it was delicious and the staff is very helpful!"}
{"text":"If you like fresh, this is the place for you. The burgers are made fresh not frozen and cooked to order. The toppings are cut fresh daily. My wife and I stopped in for lunch after reading Yelp reviews.
The menu boasts several signature burgers with specific toppings for a specific price. The other option is to build your own which is what I did. After choosing your meat, ( beef, chicken breast, or turkey) you have the option to add cheese at an additional cost. I chose cheddar. I also made my meal a lunch combo. This gives you potato wedges and a soft drink with your burger.
After about 10 minutes my order pager went off. My burger was hot, juicy, and cooked to perfection sitting on a toasted bun topped with gooey cheddar cheese. Off to the topping table. Lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, relish and more. With all these fresh toppings this towering burger barely fits on your plate not to mention in your mouth. (hint) Use a knife and fork. The potato wedges are freshly made and deliciously seasoned. My only disappointment is that they didn't offer hot sauce at the condiment bar.
This newly discovered gem is just down the street so I'm definitely looking forward to my next dining experience here."}
{"text":"Always get good food and service, however this time I ordered my burger Med and it was over cooked and very dry.  However you can't beat the sandwich topping bar and don't forget the Cheese Sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Take it or leave it... Just a burger that you can add your own items to.  Outside of that there's nothing special about the place. Was expecting a little more based on the hype."}
{"text":"The first time I had even heard about Fuddruckers was driving home from Boston after my fiancé's birthday trip. It was delicious but to my knowledge there aren't any in NY or at least not on Long Island. We had a BOGO 1/2lb burger meal coupon so we came for an early dinner after work on Wednesday. This FR was a lot brighter and more open than the one I had previously eaten at which my fiancé and I both liked. We both ordered our burgers with American cheese and bacon, I opted for sweet potato fries. The fries were so good! I like to eat mine with honey mustard which is available behind the counter, you just have to ask. The burger was cooked perfectly and the \"build your own\" part with the tomatoes, onions, etc looked clean and fresh. We also ordered two small shakes but our cashier misheard us and charged us for larges. We still drank them, lol. I usually ALWAYS go for cookies and cream which my fiancé ordered but this time I ordered a chocolate and it was great. Definitely the better flavor of the two. The only thing was it took a while for our shakes to come out and my fiancé was finishing up her food at the point. Since they had taken our buzzer there was no way for us to know they were ready but since I was, of course, watching, I saw when they were put on the counter for pick-up. I think with the coupon we spent $26 and a had a satisfying and filling dinner. We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I now have a serious decision to make if I want a good burger on the west side of Madison. A Five Guys opened up in Greenway Station (I was a patron of the original in Arlington, VA, and still love it), but this Fuddruckers just opened up a block down the street. I have been a big Fuddruckers fan since I was a kid in Milwaukee. The general formula has changed slightly since then, but a good burger with access to every condiment imaginable remains the same.

You can get your burger grilled to your preferred level of doneness along with extras like grilled onions. Then top it off with quality condiments and veggies. I always put some A1, ketchup, deli mustard, salsa, pickles, and red onions on mine. Skip the upcharge for cheese because they have hot cheese sauce you can add on.

The wedge fries are hearty and sprinkled with a Cajun style mix, but I'd skip the onion rings. I'm an onion rings guy and was disappointed in those when I had them on a previous visit.

I haven't experienced the wait times others have, but I have usually been here for an early or late weekday lunch.

The last touch is the Coke machine - I love my Dasani grape flavored water."}
{"text":"Good Food, staff was friendly, maybe a little too friendly. One of the works asked how our meal was about 7 times. He was nice tho! Food came out quick and the jalapeno cheese was soooooo good so I am happy! Loved the free style coke machine too!"}
{"text":"Burgers are fantastic and my 2 year old loved the chicken fingers. I think her name was Lakisha working Friday night on June 19th, excellent customer service! She was very attentive and friendly. We will definetely be back and recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"hadn't been to one since leaving CA.  didn't disappoint.  burgers were good, everyone friendly!  loved my sweet potato fries!  We've never really liked their wedge fries.  I went w/ the manager's special-perfect size for me.  my husband loved his 1/2 lb burger."}
{"text":"My daughter request your restaurant every time she makes great grades on her report card. We make the 45-minute trip just to have dinner there at your restaurant. This last visit was extremely busy with a lot of birthday parties. The burgers were great as usual but the onion rings were lackluster."}
{"text":"Ate there by myself. $16.50 for a burger, drink, fries and coleslaw. The hamburger was OK, with the exception of the bun being much too big. Most upscale burger places include fries with their burgers, but Fuddruckers does not. I paid $2.49 for the skimpiest portion of coleslaw, and $2.49 for 12 fries (12!). No one asked me how my food was, and none of the four employees I passed as I left acknowledged me. Las Vegas has many far-better burger places, so I won't return to this one."}
{"text":"One of the best hamburgers out I have ever had. Everything was fresh and tasty. They grind the ground beef in house, they also bake their own buns, yummy! I ordered the 1/2 pound bacon cheeseburger medium with fries and a drink, it was the 10$ special of the day. We also got a onion ring to try on the side. I must say the burger was cooked to perfection and it was plenty because I was unable to finish it. The onion rings and fries where great too. Loved they had cheese sauce on the bar, I was happy with the food and service. This was my cheat/recharge meal for the week and I'm glad we chose this. Will return soon."}
{"text":"SO upset right now! Went to eat at this location on Monday 11/10/2014. Swiped my card and enjoyed an expensive meal. The horrible part was when I realized they had drained every dollar out of my checking account with one swipe! They ran the purchase 8 times (until I ran out of funds) and then ran it 12 (YES 12!) More times. I have been calling the restaurant since Monday evening and STILL have not heard from their corporate offices. I was told by my bank these were just \"authorizations\" and would not go through and all would be well tonight. GUESS AGAIN! My (stupid stupid stupid!) Bank (BVA Compass) processed every single charge (all 20 of them!) and charged me NSF fees for all of them. Its now 10 PM on Thursday and my account is $2500 in the negative and my entire pay check gets direct deposited tomorrow, and all they tell me at the restaurant is there is nothing they can do. HORRIBLE AWFUL WORST ever customer service from Corporate Fuddrucker's. The managers (Romero and Roland) have been very nice throughout but the company is total shit IMO."}
{"text":"I worked at a fuddruckers back in Ohio when I was 16 to 19 years old. Now that I'm 30 i look back and realize It was the best first job, and the owner was great. To bad they closed down, but lucky me when I loved to Arizona when I was 20 there was still some locations around.

This location did not disappoint. I got my bunless 2/3 lb burger burger cooked perfectly medium and with all the fixings at the topping bar. Love the drink station too with plenty of selections! I also think it's great they still make the same brownies from when I was a kid working there. 

I will be back to get my fix!"}
{"text":"holy lord.

good yummy exotic burgers... just the way i like it?! its great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ostrich burger was outstanding! super lean & high in protein. they served it on wheat which was toasted perfectly. i got jack cheese. good choice

i like the potato wedges with cheese on it.

i also had the elk burger once, but i like the ostrich better.

best exotic burger ive ever had! and i dont even like burgers much!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love That this location has malts and not just shakes. Burgers and fries are good love the hot jalpeno cheese."}
{"text":"The good:

Fudd is willing to serve a medium burger. It seems that many places now will not serve anything below med-well.  If I want something well done, I can go to fast food. With a thicker burger, I want it a little more tender. The staff seem to know how to temp because I got what I ordered. No underdone and not leather.

The soda fountains look cool. They have a decent selection if you are getting a fountain drink.

The dressing ingredients seemed fresh. And after a hike I grabbed plenty of pickles because I was craving salt.

The maybe:

My wife complained that her root beer didn't taste right. There are 3 possible issues here: 1 is she doesn't drink much soda (like probably the equivalent of a can or two  per YEAR) so maybe she just doesn't have a good idea of what that brand normally tastes like. The other is the machines meant there was some mixing so she was getting more than just root beer. And last was the syrup, water or CO2 could've been off. I have no idea which because I gave up all pop a year and a half ago so I didn't taste it. I won't hold that against them but did want to mention it in case other people have had similar experiences with the soda fountains.

The less good:

The price. It just seems a touch high. A combo is $3.75. Many chain burger places include unlimited fries and charge $2.50-$3 for a drink. If you go with a coupon this is worth it. But for me and my wife, that's pretty spendy. I never drink pop and she rarely does. Seems like they could go the route of other places and do burgers with unlimited fries for the same or slightly cheaper and let guests buy their drinks. The combo system just feels too... fast food?


Overall I think it was a good burger but for 2 people it was about $3-5 higher than I'd expect to pay at other chain burger restaurants. If Yelp allowed half stars, I'd go with 3.5. Based on the descriptions \"A-OK\" seems more appropriate for me than \"I'm a fan\"."}
{"text":"One of the worst customer service I have ever had. I understand that it was busy due to viva Las Vegas but watch 5 people who were behind us get there food first. An hour late finally got our food it was over done and dry. Tried to let someone know but was ignored numerous times. My husband eat his and got food poisoning. For 3 days he couldn't hold anything down or even look at food. I will never visit again or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"One word: cockroach!!!! A large live one fell on my husband's leg while we were sitting in a booth. He flicked it off and then killed it. This disgusting incident caused us to look around a little closer at our surroundings. The carpeted floor had crumbs, drink lids and bits of food all over. The knick knacks had cobwebs. When we went to tell the manager about the cockroach, we noted food all over the floor behind the counter. Dirty dishes were sitting on tables. When we told the manager about the roach, he didn't seem surprised. He apologized and said he'd call the exterminator right away. He did not offer to comp our dinners (which were only half eaten) or give us any other incentive to come back - not that we would EVER go back anyway.

This incident comes a few years after our last visit to Fuddruckers at the Superstition Springs location, in which my daughter discovered a live beetle in her ceasar's salad. Disgusting!

I called Fuddruckers corporate office as well as the Arizona Health Dept. the next day."}
{"text":"It was our first time eating here ever. Always thought Fuddruckers would have some awesome food, especially because they've been around for awhile. We were in the area and decided to pop in for dinner. Luckily, it was Tuesday and kids eat free. Perfect! 

You order your food when you walk in. They give you a buzzer so you can go up and get your food when it's ready. We ordered 2 1/3lb burger combos and 2 kids Mac n cheese 1 with fries and the other with apples. The burgers cost $5.59 and it's $4.59 to make it a combo, which is a drink and fries. Kids meals are usually $4.49. After tax, our total was $22.04. 

There's an area with vegetables and condiments for your burger as You put them on yourself once you get your food. They even had melted jalapeño cheddar cheese or regular cheddar cheese. 

Food came out in 10 minutes or so... let's start with the burgers. They were dry, plain and nothing special. Unfortunately, my husband and I don't care for them at all. We really wanted to like them, but no. Carl's Jr. Has better burgers. The fries were ok, but you do need to eat with ketchup or something because it can be dry by itself. The kids Mac n cheese was the kraft one out of the box, so you can't go wrong with that. The apples were a bit sour, but they give a nice portion. 

The dining area was a decent size. There were a lot of tables that were waiting to be cleared and cleaned. Someone did make their way around to do that when we were almost done with our meal. 

The bathroom could use a little attention. It smelt like pee! 

On a good note, the cashier was friendly. She greeted us when we entered. 

Sorry fuddruckers, but we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I used to love Fuddruckers, but had not visited one in a few years until last evening.  Four of us went there for an early dinner about 5pm.  The staff members were friendly and smiling.  The fix-it yourself produce bar was clean and filled with fresh tomatoes, lettuce, etc.

Ok, that's all the good parts.  

The bad parts are that the entire restaurant was dirty!  The empty tables were not bussed, cleaned off, or put in order. There was debris (both food and paper) on the tables, chairs, and floor.  The place was less than half full of customers.  The windows, crane machines, and condiment dispensers were filthy. We had to ask to have the dried food smears on our table cleaned and the busboy simply wiped off the table with most of the stuff landing on the chair seats.  We then had to ask him to clean off the chair seats.  When he walked back to the kitchen/order area he passed 3 other empty tables that were also dirty and he didn't even look at them.  Our onion rings were cold, my 3/4 pound burger had been ordered medium well and it came out medium rare.  My wife's crispy chicken salad came out with no chicken and when she pointed this out to the server he, using his bare hands, put 3 cold  breaded chicken strips on top. 

 The condition of this restaurant is clearly a failure of management...pure and simple! I will not go back to this location and will advise others to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"On the eve of a Midwest Road Trip, Diane and I selected Fuddruckers for a sendoff dinner.  My Swiss Melt 1/3-lb. Burger with Mushrooms, Grilled Onions, and Wedge Cut Fries was very tasty, and the Wedge Cut Fries were great, with and without the restaurant's Signature Cheese Sauce and Jalapeno Cheese Sauce.  But I found the Hamburger Bun to be relatively small for a burger of this size, and the meat inside was more medium than medium rare as ordered.  The two cheese sauces tasted identical, except one had bits of potent jalapeno embedded in the slowly flowing cheese.

I was impressed that all vegetables on display at the produce bar were super fresh, and there were two types of lettuce and two types of pickles available.  The Dill Pickle Chips were real juicy.  So much so that vibrant pickle juice actually squirted into my throat.  Fat Fries were really good, but on the soft side.  

For good measure, and to sample something new, I also downed a Jumbo Hot Dog that was listed on the check as a \"Dogzilla.\"  Also coming with Wedge Cut Fries, this was a very big split and grilled John Morrell All-Beef Frank laid out on a rather bready Hot Dog Bun.  About this time I found that the Signature Cheese Sauce had run out.  After telling the manager, he provided a ladle for me to draw out a needed sum of cheese sauce below the dispensing area rather than refill the sauce container, informing me that it takes 45 minutes to prepare a new batch and less than an hour remained before closing.  Since I was able to spoon out all cheese sauce that I desired, I found this decision to be reasonable.      

I washed everything down with a very good smooth and cold Chocolate Milk Shake that looked swirled but tasted solid.  When initially presented, there was more creamy liquid goodness in the accompanying milk shake tin than in the large filled glass itself.  Amazing!

Just before we left the premises, I heard the manager telling other diners that they had to be out in 15 minutes by the posted closing time with to go orders only or sit at outdoor tables \"because of labor costs.\"  This position I found to be somewhat unreasonable, since it is customary for restaurants to allow all diners who arrive before the posted closing time to remain inside at least another 30 to 60 minutes to finish their meals."}
{"text":"Great burgers I had a chile burger and it was delish the seasoned fries were good and it sure beat the rest of the fast food burger joints. I haven't had Fuddruckers in a few years. I mean what more can I say if you wan't good burgers just go here."}
{"text":"Food has gone down hill. Our last order the burgers were super greasy. Also they had a lady who cleared tables who was the nicest sweetest person but the last few times we were in there she was not there. After we left last time I left my wallet. By the time we reached home someone called me about my wallet. Only bad part about this is the employee who found my wallet took the cash I had in it already. Granted it was only five dollars but that was also the cash I had for my daughter for the tooth fairy. We won't be coming back here anymore. And we had come because of my sons birthday since he likes it there."}
{"text":"Was in the area and the fam was hungry so we decided to eat here.  We have one of these back East but this time it wasn't as good as I had remembered.  Burgers weren't bad but weren't great either..."}
{"text":"Thought it was just OK.  No complaints about the food (was fairly good, really) or service but overall was unremarkable."}
{"text":"I have never liked the food at Fuddruckers.  I am convinced that they use the fake beef that Taco Bell does. Their burgers taste like salt and butter flavored pam to me.  This location is particularly awful since it is a total mess all the time and the employees don't seem to want to be there."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the elk burger. Lean...hard to find. In a gluten free bun....healthy. Consistently good and fast. Friendly staff. Keep it up."}
{"text":"5 stars for taste and portion! I've always loved Fuddruckers because of their customization. I can make it my own. It's been a while since I've been and because of my past experiences with wait time and not having one close to home I don't frequent too often. Today I dropped by for a pick up during my lunch break and I was happy to find out they take orders via phone. That was really helpful! As soon as I got there my food was ready. I only got the turkey burger but as soon as I took my first bite I was tempted for sides. This burger screams add a shake and fries. Though Fuddruckers is a little expensive for a single burger for nearly $9 it's totally worth it. There's no way you can walk away and still be hungry. Wish you guys would open a location close to Avondale!"}
{"text":"Just horrible!!! How can a burger place run OUT OF FRIES!!!! 

I went to order my usual--- Bacon Burger with fries. The point coming here is for their jalapeño cheddar dipping sauce.

They didn't even offer a coupon or anything for future visit. They ran out of fries at 7:30 pm when they are open til 10 or 11 pm."}
{"text":"Very good.  Always get the 1 pounder and then spilt it.  Being able to load up the burger with whatever is a good deal.  Meat quality is good.  Bread/bun is good.  Price isn't horrible."}
{"text":"Fresh baked buns, fresh cut fires, fresh meat, multiple choices of meat (buffalo, ostrich, etc) and fresh produce to pick on your burger. This place puts other fast food restaurant's to shame!"}
{"text":"When you first walk into a revolving door you walk into the waiting line.  What I enjoy about this is instead of peering above the cash register you can read a large version that they have as decor on the wall.  Descriptions, prices, and calories are included with the menu.  (Note-there's quite a few calories in most of the choices, but chances are you are splurging on fastish food like we were.) 

Burgers are really good.  There is a full burger bar so instead of requesting no tomato but extra pickles you can choose which of those you want.  Kids meals come with a free cookie that can be grabbed right away or you can wait until after your meal in case your under-twelve child want dessert first.  The burgers are made to order and you choose your size (1/3 pound, 1/4 pound, 1/2 pound) or turkey or veggie options as well.

However, here I need to point out the shakes. While we ordered soda and used one of the fun Coke machines that give you refills of any flavor combination you want, there were others sipping what looked like milkshake heaven.

My daughter was in sensory enthrallment watching the lights, games, and television.  The food didn't take long to prep and the sides were excellent.  The kid's chicken were breast tenders rather than plain nuggets, the wedges were crisp and coated with Cajun type seasoning.  Fortunately my kiddo likes spice.

The place was clean, well staffed and the food was good.  At approximately $10/meal it isn't much more than fast food and the quality was better."}
{"text":"I love me some Fuddruckers. 

They have some really great protein options here, so there's literally something for everyone. I'm usually not a fan of serving myself, but I do enjoy having the ability to add all the condiments I want onto my own burger. I usually stock up on pickles and cheese dip. They're both delicious. Not together, mind you.

I usually order one of the specialty burgers and share an onion rings or wedges with my dining companion. This is usually plenty even for the hungriest of burger lovers. Order a milkshake as part of your combo as well. They're great!

When you're in need of a quick meal on your way to bowling or during a quick break from the poker table this food court is a great option."}
{"text":"This is a decent Fuddrucker's location with plenty of seating a nice topping bar with plenty of fresh vegetables. 

The service was friendly and efficient and all our burgers were cooked perfectly to order. I enjoyed my burger and it we especially good once I added pickles, lettuce and tomatoes from the self-service topping bar.

They have TV's as well, so it's convenient if you're trying to grab a quick bite and also watch the game."}
{"text":"Went with another couple and our kids on a early Saturday evening. No line! For those of you who have never been to a Fuddrucker's you place your order at the counter, pay and they give you a pager to go pick up your order when complete.

We order 1 Kobe burger plus bacon and cheese. 2 kids cheeseburger combos (definitely the way to go unless you are a big eater) bucket of beers.

Your burgers will come undressed. They have a awesome condiment bar stocked full of the customary lettuce, tomatoes and onion but they also have pico de gallo, jalapeño and banana pepper slices, nacho cheese, ranch....and you serve yourself. I always make potachos out of my fries adding pico and nacho cheese. Yum.

Kids meals come with wedge fries, a small drink and a cookie coupon. Fuddruckers have those awesome Coke freestyle drink machines. 

We like this place. They have a limited alcoholic beverage selection and about half a dozen game machines in the back to keep the kids occupied.

The young gentleman that walks around cleaning tables and asking if you need anything is a great host and addition to the floor.

The only drawback to Fuddrucker's is the cost. I find it a little pricy for a burger. The Kobe burger is $11.99 without cheese and without wedge fries or a drink, adding those add another $3.99 to the price."}
{"text":"I used to travel 4o weeks of the year for work. While in Albuquerque teaching I used to take the class to Fuddruckers for lunch. Easy to get in and out and the burgers were good. Had not been to one in Phoenix for many years. 

Recently we visited the one at Arrowhead. If you have not been they will cook you a burger plain or have your choice of added (beacon, mushrooms, peppers, Ect.) Then when you get the burger you put on the lettuce, tomato, more peppers, mustard, ketchup, Ect. You have a choice of Beef, Buffalo, Elk. Pricing is fair. You will not spend more than most hamburger places. 
The decor is early american roads. (Road signs, old gas pumps,"}
{"text":"We went for the exotic menu - buffalo, elk and ostrich offerings. We have been trying to stick with a moderately paleo diet and thought that these burgers might just work for us. I ordered the elk burger sans grill seasoning (contains gluten) without the bun. The menu states that the game is grass and grain fed, so I am not sure how closely this falls to our paleo needs but we figured it was close enough for a Friday night cheat meal. 

When the burgers were ready we hit the toppings bar and loaded up lettuce, onions, pico and pickles then made ourselves some burger wraps. I will admit the elk was not quite the medium well I requested, it was quite well done but that's ok. It also seemed to be very fatty considering it has \"lean\" in the menu description. As I cut pieces off the fat cooled and congealed on my knife leaving a thick white coating of elk fat. 

For the price I think next time I might just hit up Sprouts or the Meat Shop and get myself some truly grass fed meat and veggies to make wraps at home. But for a lazy night Fuddruckers does the trick."}
{"text":"Good burgers and make your own burger  fixings bar. I always go for the Buffalo burger - juicy and tasty. 
Good food, the decor and dining room is nothing special. A coupleTVs but that's it.  
A good go to place for a decent burger without leaving feeling bloated"}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times, the food is good, corse. I like that they have so many sauces, and toppings we can get our selves. I'm only giving this place 2 stars cause one dude raised his voice to me recently. Which upset me. I thought it was uncalled for. I didn't raise my voice to him. I have been here 2 times. One time a girl was the cashier she was nice, and very attractive. The 2nd time I came here cause I saw online they have game burgers, exotic meats, so I signed up online to get updates with my e-mail and they sent me a coupon for a burger, fries & a drink for 7$. Usually I'm guessing depending on the burger you get it would be 12$ for that. I went the 2nd time with the coupon and asked if I could use it towards the bison burger. He said yes, and I was going to pay the difference. Which came out to me 11$ or something. But I got confused, and was like I don't get why it's so much, and was asking him about that. For some reason my brain thought it was 7$ for a burger, and the math in my head was thinking so it's 9$ for the bison burger or like 10$ for the bison burger, n I subtracted 7$ from 10$ and was thinking I should be paying 3$ or something. I'm not good @ math. Sometimes I literally shut my brain off, cause I don't want to think and I have to turn the switch back on the make it work. Anyway I just asked the dude to explain it to me, and he was like he got pissed off @ me for asking him. Maybe it was cause there where 2 people behind me, IDK, but there was another cashier there they could have called to the front. N If I think someone it ripping me off, that amount of difference, I'm going to ask them to explain how they got that price. Just trying to understand. Later the dude said ''sorry for the confusion'' that really didn't help make me feel better. I don't like to be yelled @ n really customers shouldn't ever be yelled @, well he didn't yell he just raised his voice in a uncalled for, rude way. The dude was much older, could be a grandpa N I'd expect he'd be wiser then that. He should have said, sorry for raising my voice to you. Cause its not his fault I was confused. It's my lack of paying attention in math classes fault 4 the confusion. When I worked in customer service, @ my mothers restaurant, I never yelled or raised my voice to customers , even when they deserved it, like where cursing @ me, cause someone got there order wrong. In the customer service industry you should always act professional, no exceptions. Raising your voice to a customer is not professional. I'm not saying I won't be back here, but I may avoid that dude. The bison burger was sorta small, and was okay. I think beef taste better personally."}
{"text":"I haven't had Fuddruckers in such a looong time, that I was actually excited to get to eat here again.

Back then, I'd usually go for the Taco Salad. But this time, I actually tried to get a 1/2 lb. burger. I tried it by itself, without any condiments or what not, and it was very bland. Thank goodness I could get as many condiments and sauces as i wished to add on some flavor to my burger. It went so good with the jalapeño cheddar.
Their sweet potato fries were so so.. not a whoa.

I loved their clean trays of condiments and sauces. 

The cookies were also very good, especially the M&M ones. 

They have a really fancy Vending machine."}
{"text":"I wouldn't eat her  again if it was free... paid 14$ for inferno burger I think they gave me buffalo burger instead or at least tasted like buffalo ... so greasy and tasteless ... pleasee PLEASE stay away from this shit hole"}
{"text":"Love the food at this place however the hostess asked us to repeat everything we said, she either was not listening or didn't care. Either way food is great but don't expect the service to be."}
