{"text":"Wow great sushi and creative display of it!  The inside is really nice, clean, and comfortable."}
{"text":"This is an awesome concept. All you can eat sushi, hibachi, appetizers, etc... That's all cooked fresh to order. You really can't beat the price either. We were thoroughly impressed with the overall experience. The sushi was delicious, the hibachi chicken was excellent as well. The hibachi show is not a factor for us anymore, so when we want Japanese food,  Mr. Tokyo will be the choice from now on."}
{"text":"I was so excited to take my mom to eat here while she was visiting this week. I have been here so many times and had always enjoyed it. There was a man sitting at the table next to us who told his server he couldn't eat one of the rolls because he didn't like the sauce. He said he tried to make himself eat it but just couldn't do it. He asked not to be charged for not eating it. (He was extremely nice about it) The female manager came over and insisted he would be charged but offered him a box (he didn't like it). They started to argue and she threatened to call the police, all because he didn't want to be charged for something he didn't like. If we had not had put our order in already we would have left. I worked in restaurants for over 12 years, and have never seen anything like it. I'm boycotting this place."}
{"text":"I was about to walk in for lunch today and a lady that works there opened the door, locked it, and walked back inside without saying a word. I tried the door and sure enough...locked. Turns out there was a long wait and that must have been their approach. Never seen that before."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had! Great for if you're really hungry, they have an unlimited option where you can get as much as you want for one price! So cool. Definitely will be returning.   The ambiance is nice too. Not too fancy, not too cheap looking. It looks better inside than it does outside I'd say"}
{"text":"I went here for the lunch buffet on a Thursday around ~12:00 pm. It was packed. The waiting time for a table wasn't too bad though. I was with one other person. Our first order was only 2 Chef special rolls, but the staff took a pretty long time serving it to us, as if they had forgotten about us. After that, our orders were served somewhat quicker.  I love the option of trying different types of rolls and having them being FRESHLY made at such an affordable price. The sushi was excellent.  The location is good. The price is right. The restaurant is a bit small, but the design is nice. I will definitely come here again. Totally recommended!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times. Food and service is good!!! Fresh fish for the sushies Tasty and pretty cheap for sushi buffet on weekdays lunch!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I was pleasantly surprised. The food and service was great. Make sure you try the Panther Roll!"}
{"text":"It is an all you can eat but with a catch    If you order sashimi you pay 50 cents extra each piece  The roll has a lot of rice and veggie so not much raw fish  There is a no waste food policy  So overall you would be stuff with rice and veggie   I only order a plate and cannot finish all of it they wanted to charge me $6 more"}
{"text":"Wow. Great deal! Great Food!! Love this place!  The sushi was excellent and so was the stir fry. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Wow, this was a fantastic find via yelp reviews. The sushi is fresh, unique and can't be beat for $17.99/person!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi??!! I was in heaven but bring your appetite! I over ordered not expecting how big the rolls are. I ended up paying extra to take it home. Super delicious and very fresh!"}
{"text":"I've already went to this place three times in a month! It is pretty awesome for the price and selections. ($11.99 lunch and $17.99 dinner) It is an order off the menu, all you can eat Japanese Restaurant. You can also opt out of the buffet and just order off the menu. The good thing about this place is that all items are made fresh for you. We typically start out with appetizers. (Their crab ragoon is pretty good) then you will feel tempted to get a hibachi plate which is delicious! Try to share a plate. But just be warned to not ordered alot of sushi because you will be so full! My best advice is skip the hibachi or order only 2-3 sushi rolls if you are going to have it. They have a disclosure that you cannot waste food and they will charge .50 cents a pc for wasted sushi. The sushi is pretty good for the price you pay. Since they make the rolls fresh for you, you will not have to worry about the the being hard and stale from sitting out too long. I've already gotten my family, friends and co-workers addicted to this place!"}
{"text":"Quality of food was good but reducing rating because of misleading advertisement about pricing. I received hard copy of advertisement stating unlimited lunch for USD 12.99. When I visited the restaurant and settled down on the table, they refused to follow their own advertised price stating that the advertised price is not applicable on weekend. If that's the case, they should have clarified it (that the price not valid on weekends) at least somewhere on the full A4 size paper advertisement. Other stand they took is that the price menu is provided prior to ordering the food and have choice to go somewhere else. Seems to be unfair to give that option to customers when they travel from long distance with family based on the misleading advertisement. Hope the management stop misleading advertisement."}
{"text":"This is an \"all you can eat\" sushi/hibachi place. However, if you waste any food you'll get charged some $ for not finishing them. I think it's .50 per piece. We live about an hour away but this has become our go to spot for sushi. It is the BEST and freshest sushi that we've ever had and so we do make the drive whenever we're in the mood for sushi. We've had the clear soup, cream cheese Rangoon, spring rolls,  pork dumplings, and tempura shrimp and tempura vegetables off the appetizer menu before and we loved it! For sushi, you'll have to mark on the piece of paper what you want and they'll make it fresh for you. Keep in mind, it's not like going to the Chinese buffet and picking it off the bar. We haven't had anything here that we didn't like. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi and can eat a lot!!! Price for adult during lunch is 12.99 and for dinner it's 18.99. Yes, it may seem pricey but for the quality and quantity of the food here you will not be disappointed. It's always so busy that sometimes we have to get on the waitlist to be seated but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Fresh fish, great customer service, very authentic japanese dishes! Very very good value because you will never find such fresh and good sushi anywhere for such a low price! The best part is it's ALL YOU CAN EAT!"}
{"text":"Food is ok...  we arrived (party of 2)and put our name on he list for a table and was told 30-35 minutes.  After and hour and five minutes we were finally seated.  Just a mere hour and 40 minutes to get the food.  I feel bad leaving the review that I am the stupid one that spent 2 hours and 40 plus minutes trying to eat sushi....  will not make this mistake again!"}
{"text":"It was our first time trying the all you can eat Sushi today and it won't be our last! Some of our favorites were the Sunny Roll, Angel Hair, Snow White, & Crunchy Roll. The Rainbow Roll and Excolar Nigiri are also really good. Everything tasted fresh! Excellent service!"}
{"text":"The unlimited sushi is an awesome deal. The sushi was absolutely amazing got 11 rolls and 2 hibachi for a table of 4 all doing the unlimited . Recommend the deep blue roll, the spicy girl roll and the snow white."}
{"text":"Love this place. Go every couple  months! Fresh made all you can eat! Little pricey but for sushi, it's a good value. Kids love it too and a variety of non sushi items."}
{"text":"Me and my husband come here all the time. I also introduced it my work friends and they have been obsessed ever since. I love getting fried rice with veggies it comes with a delicious sauce. I haven't tried anything spicy but I've tried everything else. My favorite is the pink lady roll and my husband gets the mango roll. We always get it with at least 3 Philly rolls. It's a great deal I've yet to find another all you can eat sushi place as good as this one."}
{"text":"Been here several times now, great service, good sushi, wide variety on the menu, good price."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the all you can eat buffet. The sushi was good but pretty average and it was more expensive than other places I've been. It is pretty small inside so there was some wait on a Saturday afternoon. Overall, a good but average place."}
{"text":"Came here because they have all you can eat sushi. I love that is gives you the opportunity to try a bunch of different rolls. Plus, every option we had was delicious and a great portion for the price! We also love that the AYCE menu offers other options for people who may not be sushi fans. We always try to stop by for lunch when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"I was interested to see if they had updated their website......it was taken down after my last review on 5/21/2016....I gave them a 3 star this time for their effort to right their erroneous pricing on the old site. That being said......you may want to proof what you write once again unless of course your new dinner hours are really 3:30am - 10pm   Who knows with those hours I may try your restaurant again when my insomnia strikes!   DINNER ALL YOU CAN EAT MENU SATURDAY & SUNDAY ALL DAY 3:30AM - 10:00PM"}
{"text":"Love this place. All you can eat sushi  for $17.99!!! It's totally worth it with just 4 rolls!! Second time here and it was just as good as the first! Had a big party of 10 and was able to get food pretty quickly And everything was correct and delicious!! Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"To start off I absolutely love their no waste mindset. I came in here very excited but confused as to how it all worked. Out server was absolutely amazing and even ordered his favorite meal for us to try. We had the tiger roll which my husband enjoyed and I am obsessed with the sumo roll. Our other favorite item on the menu was the crab ragoon. Honestly it was so hot and the cheese was creamy I could of eaten 50 of them."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best sushi place in Charlotte.  They offer all you can eat sushi and its top notch quality sushi. The staffs are great and friendly and the place has a nice environment the sushi are very aesthetic"}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant in charlotte .. take my word for it .. I've tried the fried rice .. panther roll .. dynamite roll .. angel hair roll .. spicy cali roll .. spicy tuna roll .. and they were all unbelievable .."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and very nice ambiance ! Excellent food ! very reasonable price.  I have been here for lunch couple of times with my family, they loved it.  I am going to be a frequent visitor for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Walked into the restaurant only to stand at the door and not receive any service for 5 minutes. No one even acknowledged our presence until we decided to seat ourselves. Only then did one of the restaurant associates tells us to wait but then proceeds to continue what he was doing prior. Very rude and unacceptable. Will never come to establishment again."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, amazing service, the food is absolutely fresh and delicious. I will back soon!!"}
{"text":"For those that have actually had great sushi before, this restaurant will disappoint.   Fake crab on everything, room temp pieces of raw fish.  Everything smothered in so much \"special sauce\" that you can't taste what little fish is in the roll.  It's commercial and probably a good place for people that have not had truely great sushi.  Update:  Immigration Krab should be reserved for the worst grocery store packaged sushi.  It has no business being in a restaurant. People need to understand that \"the best sushi restaurant in Charlotte\" falls short here.  Raising your prices and serving quality food would be helpful."}
{"text":"Really, really good. My new go to oriental restaurant. Very clean place and very friendly staff. Great sushi, I tried a California roll, tuna roll, spicy tuna and volcano roll. Felt like rolls got bigger and bigger. Plus all you can eat, $12."}
{"text":"Really good all you can eat sushi! You can pick and choose what you want for a good price. This place is worth eating for sushi lovers cause you can fill your stomach. This is better than some Japanese restaurants because you can have a sushi challenge. I would like to come again and again."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place... it's the best sushi in town, and a hidden gem right now. All you can eat!"}
{"text":"I wish I knew about this place sooner! All-you-can-eat made to order for only $12.99 for lunch is an awesome deal. The sushi is fresh and delicious. If you like great sushi that doesn't break the bank, then you should definitely check this place out. They do offer other delicious menu options, if sushi is not your thing. My boyfriend hates fish, so he orders the hibachi and appetizers. This is not your typical buffet where the menu items have been sitting out for who knows how long! They actually make it to order, so you know that what you're getting is always going to be fresh! Do yourself a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"Appetizers were yum. Get the yellowtail jalapeno and tokyo bowl (which isn't a bowl at all, but salmon sashimi wrapped around spicy kani).  Nigiris were pretty good.   Teriyaki chicken came out less than warm and the rice was slightly under cooked, did not enjoy that.  Sushi rolls are good..but they can be on the bigger side with more rice, so not a favorite of ours. If you are into the fancy rolls with lots of ingredients and can down a bunch, you'll love this place. It is meant for you.   I've been to the one in Pineville and this location a few times..and each time.. we order the BBQ squid. Each time, they have \"forgotten\". They always say \"it takes the longest, 30 minutes\". OK, we'll wait. The last time we went, we knew it would be a wait for the BBQ squid, so we ordered it right away and when we got our first orders, we reminded the waitress we ordered the BBQ squid so they wouldn't \"forget\" again, because we do really like the BBQ squid. Not just from this place, but in general.  Well, they did \"forget\". And they blamed it on the breaker going off because they were getting so many orders. Over an hour later, after we were done with all of our other food, we finally got it..and they were basically cold. Not hot off the grill or broiler or where ever they were cooked in/on. It's like they don't want you to have the squid, so they keep \"forgetting\" or saying it takes long in hopes that you will not want to wait for it? I don't know, but it's very disappointing that one of our favorite offerings this place has seems to be a hassle to order, and makes us not want to go anymore, even if it's a deal with the price. It's not that worth it when you leave dissatisfied and sometimes annoyed."}
{"text":"The food was very good and our server frequently checked in on us.  Some reviews said they used too much rice, but It didn't seem like it to us.  We were really happy with everything we had- salads, rolls, nigiri and hand roll. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"They could care less about disabled patrons. No accommodation for my daughter's wheelchair. We had to leave."}
{"text":"I have been to Mr. Tokyo twice now and really love this place! All You Can Eat sushi for both lunch and dinner. I feel like the lunch AYCE is such an amazing deal as its like $11!   On my most recent trip, a group of us went for lunch. I ordered dumplings and 3 specialty rolls. Yes, 3.....I wanted to die after but I finished them all! Next time I may just skip the appetizers and go straight to the rolls. My favorite roll was the Snow White roll. I also ordered a Dragon Roll. Forgot the last one but all 3 rolls were delish! They do have alot of deep fried rolls. Those aren't really my jam but if you are into deep fried rolls, they got em!  In addition to AYCE sushi, they do AYCE hibachi. I have had the hibachi on my first visit and thought it was super tasty and filling. I would say if you are just doing hibachi, order 2 as they are a smaller sized portion.   Note: They do charge you for uneaten food and the rolls are definitely not small. So, order wisely!"}
{"text":"Best all-you-can-eat sushi in town! Good service, nice ambience and plenty of quality tasty options. My only downfall is that I overdo it every time, but that's not a complaint."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 2 stars only because the food was just ok. They didn't have any sugar free soda options. Ordered hibachi shrimp. Food tasted decent but the shrimp were TINY. Then we got the bill..$50 for 3 people for lunch at a fast food Japanese place?? This isn't Kabuto and not even a fraction of the quality. Most places like this charge $10 per plate for the same thing. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"super good food and great customer service. i love the crab rangoon and the fried cheesecake her."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a large quantity of really bad food and service like The Walking Dead this place is for you"}
{"text":"I am in town visiting from Dallas and my sister brought me here. In Dallas all you can eat sushi is everywhere. This is the first one of its kind here in Charlotte  (I'm originally from here). The food was yummy and the service was great. I don't know if he was the owner, but the young gentleman with the glasses came over to talk to us after we finished. Very nice guy. Try the crabmeat salad! Great price for all you can eat!"}
{"text":"This place was very good. Can't believe they've been open since April and I haven't heard about until stumbling across the top-rated reviews here on Yelp. Everything from the service, the food quality, selection (abundance) to the ambience was top notch. $11.99 AYCE lunch... $17.99 AYCE for dinner. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just love the concept. Sushi is decent.  Food comes out hot. Hibachi can be too salty at times, but over all I still give 5 stars"}
{"text":"If the Carolinas lack anything, it's good Asian food. There is literally zero good Chinese food. Mr. Tokyo almost makes up for it with their Japanese offering. This has become our favorite place to eat in the Charlotte area. The value is incredible - $14 for lunch and $19(?) for dinner.   The nigiri quality is what you'd expect. You definitely get what you pay for. I wish they had the white tuna (escolar) at lunch.   They change their roll offerings almost too much that I don't remember which ones I liked and if they were removed. I will say the rolls are really the best value here. Having moved from out of state, some of their rolls easily can go toe-to-toe with rolls we've seen go for $14 at regular price (which we got at half-price #ladies night).   What I love is they also have hibachi and [at dinner] noodle dishes - great for people who don't like sushi (they have a bunch of other non-sushi items).   Their cheese rangoons (now crab?)...I think they're imported from heaven and are delivered on a golden cloud of hope and joy.   The service is great. Never had a problem. The hosts will often pitch in to help deliver the food. And they are surprisingly very accommodating - I was near full and wanted fried rice and they said they'd do a small plate vs regular size for me. Awesome people.   So overall, heck yes. The quality is better than you'd expect and the rolls are better than we deserve."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday night with my family and the service was great! This place probably has one of the most efficient and attentive service I've experience so far around the area.  Someone is always coming back to check and take orders since this is an ALL YOU CAN EAT JAPANESE RESTAURANT and the best thing about it is that it's COOK TO ORDER. It's $16.99 per person during dinner time but it's so worth the price cause I'm use to paying around $30-40 per person for decent sushi at regular Japanese restaurants.  Mr. Tokyo offers sushi, sashimi, sushi rolls, hibachi entrees, soup and salads, and sushi appetizers. You name it, they probably have it.   We love love LOVE the Mr. Tokyo Roll, it's so good we had to keep ordering it. Oh, and the yellowtail jalapeño is a must try also."}
{"text":"This place is good. Service was good also. There sushi rolls are hugh compared to most other places."}
{"text":"My first trip and a very pleasant surprise.  My wife and I ordered the: Crabmeat salad Crab Rangoon Spring Roll California Roll Las Vegas Roll  I cannot eat raw fish at this time so we did not try the sushi.  The buffet was $11.99 - we went at 3:15pm.  This was more than enough food and will definitely hold me thru the evening.   Enjoy !!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Sushi bar with a great concept. Made to order all you can eat!! Sushi was very fresh and beautifully presented. Pleasant and helpful staff. Very clean restaurant. Very happy choosing to eat here and noticed a great mix of families all enjoying the great food they serve. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, however, if it is all you can eat, \"on this menu\" then everything on this menu should be all you can eat. Numerous things I picked out, they said, oh that's not part of the all you can eat. You have two menus, one is all you can eat, one is a la carte. If this is the all you can eat menu, then everything on it, should be all you can eat."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Even though it's an all you can eat sushi - this is probably one of the best sushi place in Charlotte. They make sushi fresh when you order it. The fish was very fish and the rice was cooked perfectly. Just over, I'm very impressed - Every roll Was delicious.The customer service was one of the best service I have had. Definitely will be coming back. Keep up the good work, Mr. Tokyo!!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful array of vegan options!!! I thought then all you can eat would not be worthwhile for $18 per person but two of us managed to eat over $80 of food.  I was most taken with the hand rolls. I've never had a vegetable hand roll and Mr. Tokyo offers 4 kinds. I tried them all plus the age tofu, vegetable tempura,  spring rolls, seaweed salad, tofu skin nigiri, and maki rolls. My companion was able to get a speciality roll modified to leave out the crab so he enjoyed a vegetarian roll with cream cheese, avocado,  sweet potato, and special sauce.   Everything was delicious and I can't wait to return. RuSan's used to be our go to and while they do offer a larger variety of vegetable maki, Mr. Tokyo takes the cake."}
{"text":"Very good food at a good price. I had sushi and soup. My buddy had hibachi steak. It was all fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Great staff and even better food. Sushi is all you can eat, but made to order when you get there."}
{"text":"Third visit, walked in at 9 PM and was told kitchen closes at 9:15. So no food. Second visit was great, food was good service was great. First visit, sat at bar for fifteen minutes before waitress asked if I wanted anything. Was completely ignored by guys preparing food right in front of me. Probably will try them again since probably best Japanese food near me but will expect to be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favourite sushi place because it provides delicious sushi and appetizers at a very reasonable price. I loved coming here ever since it opened and I believe it has maintained the quality of sushi. I wish they would open a Mr. Tokyo in Raleigh!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in charlotte.  Huge variety to choose from for all you can eat.  My favorite roll is the Mr. Tokyo and Deep Blue roll.   great service every time and the food is always up to standard.  Will continue to come here!"}
{"text":"This was an okay place to eat. The prices weren't bad, except that you do have to pay for any uneaten sushi. The sanitation score wasn't bad, but the floor was really greasy, the table was really sticky, and it generally didn't smell very good in the restaurant. I might would go back but would much prefer somewhere else."}
{"text":"This happens to be a good place for fresh (made to order) sushi all u can eat buffet. They have a nice sized lunch menu for only $12.99. You do have to watch what you order. The special rolls are very big so you can over order. If you do, they will charge you about $1/ per piece waste. I learned that the first time. Compared to any other buffet they are probably the best you can get in NC."}
{"text":"There aren't any places that even come close to this quality for this price. Specialty rolls are all amazing made to order with fresh ingredients. The sauces are great and the presentation is just as good as high end Japanese restaurants...all of this at an all you can eat sushi joint?? I'll be a regular"}
{"text":"I was so excited about this place!  Unfortunately,  I was not impressed. The sushi roles were huge & honestly I think that is a way to milk customers out of money. Especially if it's ayce. It's really difficult to finish a big roll that you don't even like. They also charge you for what you don't eat so go figure. The rangoons were probably the best thing I had & I really don't even remember what role I ordered. I'm glad I went during lunch for the cheaper price tag. The service was pretty decent. However, I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Best sushi around I come here all the time with my friends. I normally get lemon salmon and rainbow roll and Carolina roll. The fried ones fill you up quicker but everything is good. It stays busy though so you can expect a small wait even on weekdays"}
{"text":"Excellent AYCE sushi restaurant! When I got there, I was told there would be a 40 minute wait until the next table. I was by myself, and I didn't want to sit at the bar so I was definitely prepared to wait the whole time. I came back into the restaurant 40 minutes later and I was actually surprised at how many people were in there! It must be a popular spot.  The waitress sat me down and let me choose from a menu of sushi and other items, which I gladly accepted. I got all of the spicy options and they were extremely delicious! The sushi was well prepared, and I like the fact that they gave me a huge plate with all the sushi instead of several smaller plates like Sushi King does. No problems with my food, it came relatively quickly, and I left feeling full and satisfied! I brought some spicy mayo sauce to dip the sushi in because I knew they didn't have any there ;-)  That trip ended my search for the best sushi restaurant in Charlotte, I felt like it couldn't get better than that. Each shallow breath of mine was rewarding because I knew, due to me eating too much, that the food was good and had attacked my brain with an overload of flavor and deliciousness. Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"We went here for my husband & son's birthday with my brother in law, his wife and their son. We all got the $18.99 AYCE sushi deal and we were, I think, all very satisfied with both the quality of the food and the value for the money, considering. We gorged! This was a splurge but well worth the $. Try it all, it's all good! We all really enjoyed the crazy roll and I really liked the spicy girl roll in particular."}
{"text":"Mr. Tokyo house is an elegant restaurant situated in the heart of Charlotte. It is the favourite get together place for friends and family.  As we enter the place we were welcomed by a magnificent setting and very friendly atmosphere. There was a wide range of exotic selections of rolls. I had their house special \"Mr Tokyo Rolls\". I'm usually a very picky sushi person but this place did not fail me. Their sushi was perfectly rolled and best of all, the fish meat was extremely fresh! For the most part,  I think everything was on point  with the exception of serving their food a little too slow or maybe I was a tap impatient since I was too hungry.   Overall, good and fresh food. Reasonable price and very hospitality atmosphere. I will be back for more the next time I visit Charlotte again. Definitely recommend and encourage friends and family in their area to try this place."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in the area and came across this place on Yelp. I'm typically pretty cautious when it comes to Sushi, they're either a hit or a miss for me. Fortunately,  this place was a hit. I tried both their sushi and sashimi. Everything is very fresh and the texture felt just right. Pricing was not too bad. Dinner was $18.99 but nigiri are include and sashimi were 50 cents extra per slice. Services was great and staff there friendly. I definitely recommend this place for people in the area."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!  We had a very short wait, 15 minutes on a Saturday night, and they honored our request to be seated at a booth.  We were promptly greeted and the process was explained to us.   My husband had the shrimp tempura, soup, and the beef habachi to start with.  I started with the Phoenix Maki Roll and our daughter had the noodles and beef.  It was all sooo good.  We each ordered a second round of food as well. It was good quality sushi and my husband was happy with the taste of his as well.  He said he would like to go back (always a good sign).  You definitely need to go hungry!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites! The staff is very friendly, the food is fresh and delish! I recommend going in a group of 3 or 4 to sample it all!!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, affordable price, great service! All you can eat is the must choice (all you can eat for lunch is only $12.99) ! Their sushi rolls are good too! Went there two times a week. Be mindful that they will charge extra money for any unnecessary food waste. Will definitely come back again soon :)"}
{"text":"When you think of \"all you can eat\" you think of pre made food that's been out almost all day. Well this is different. You chose what you want and you  order as you go so there's no need to worry about other people touching the food previously. I went in with a group of 9 and they were very attentive to our needs. The decor of the place is very nice and hip. There is no loud music playing thank goodness! My favorite dish so far was the jalapeño yellow tail sashimi. There is an up charge for a few things on the menu but you're still getting a good deal for the quality of the food. Can't wait to give this place another try!"}
{"text":"I have a lot of good and bad things to say about this place. Very disappointed at the customer service and the biased way the staff there treat their Asian customers. My first time there I left disappointed in the service. The sushi isn't bad and for the price who could complain, right? Well that's what I thought, the next weekend I come back again with a party of 5, being there before we all knew what we wanted to order. So we put in our order which was a pretty big order. About 120 sushi pieces all together including rolls. The waitress comes back asking if we are sure we will finish. We say yes. 30 secs later she comes back and says the party before us ordered pretty big too it will take a while are we okay with that? We tell her kindly, \"that's okay we can wait\". The workers start bringing out our appetizers and the sushi that is ready first. So we didn't complain even though we would've liked to get everything at once but oh well. We were all really disappointed because the salmon portion to the rice was ridiculously small. I will include a picture. Maybe the staff there thought to fill us up on rice so we will be charged extra since maybe we won't finish. (We finished everything we got the first round) we wanted to order a second because five adults do eat a lot of sushi. I wanted the mr Tokyo bowl, the boys ordered about 3 more rolls and another appetizer. I guess we ate too much of their food so the waitress comes back and tells me there's no more salmon for the Tokyo bowl. So I'm like okay that's fine. My party had been there for a while more than an hour and it was starting to be their busy hour but how is it the customers fault for staying there longer than usual when other parties order before you and you have to wait your turn for your sushi, get it? A waitress comes over to ask if we were done yet. We tell her yeah we are, we just have ice cream and then can someone bring us the check. I don't know about you guys but I hate being rushed. I just felt like it was so rude of the staff to feel the need to rush people out because we were there too long when we can't control how fast they make their sushi. Again, feeling mistreated because we were Asian. Once again, I will say the sushi is good and for the price and the way the business is set up it is so worth it if you are a sushi lover. But beware because sometimes the rice portion to the nigiri will disappoint you."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised how fresh the fish was for the sushi.  For being new concept for this restaurant, they are doing a great job in execution.  One roll did not have a lot of eel to speak of which was the protein in the roll, but other than that small complaint we were very pleased.    Definitely recommend this place.  The staff us eager and ready to please.  They also ask and are interested in feed back.   As a side note, I still don't ever understand how all you can eat sushi places can afford to make it with fresh produce like this.  This is a steal."}
{"text":"What a hidden treasure! All you can eat sushi at dinner and lunch. Wonderful selection of rolls and amazing flavors! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's o.k. more like a buffet sushi kind of quality than a restaurant one. If you can eat a lot, doesn't care too much about top notch flavor,  then this place is for you and would be a good deal. Try the sashimi and you will know exactly the quality of the fish. Average."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal when it opened but I went there with my fiancé last month and overall the place has slipped a bit.  The quality of the sushi has dipped since opening month, which is understandable I suppose. I will say that their eel is not very good at all; even opening month I tried their eel roll and it was probably the worst I've had in Charlotte.  Their specialty rolls are pretty good, anything fried is a good choice, and their crazy roll was great. Not nearly as good as opening month but it's all-you-can-eat sushi so I suppose there's a tradeoff in quality.  I'll say it again the crazy roll is fantastic.  The real deal breaker for me is not the food quality.   Last time I visited was probably the first time in quite a while and they did something I'd never noticed before. Probably around round 3 of sushi the rolls started getting bigger and stuffed with noticeably more rice and fillers (celery etc) than they had in previous rounds. This continued until we stopped ordering. This is a deal breaker for me and trumps anything else since the premise of the restaurant is all-you-can-eat and since they charge you if you don't finish your plate which is clearly marked on the menu. I won't be returning to Mr. Tokyo for this reason, and the decline in quality since the restaurant opened."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, never ran out of water, food got out promptly.  It was very good and for an all you can eat place it was a pleasant surprise.  If u are in the mood for sushi this place can't be matched as far as price:quality ratio goes.  I think we def found our new sushi spot.  Also our server was very helpful and nice!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"If your looking for good sushi, look no further!! Ordered sushi here for the first time yesterday, I was actually referred here from a friend. Since I'm new to the area I've been struggling with finding decent sushi spots, I was starting to feel very unlucky because I love sushi and hibachi. So once I called here to order my food I was already pleased when I spoke with Christine she was so incredibly sweet and patient with me on the phone and also when I went to pick up our order. And as far the sushi.. \"OMG\" it was delicious. I ordered three basic rolls shrimp tempura, California, and sweet potato and it ran me about $18 w/ tax. Sushi is expensive pretty much anywhere normally I would pay over $25, or $30 so not only do you get good food but you also save money here as well. I was unable to take a picture this time around but will def update my review with my photos next time I order."}
{"text":"I love Mr. Tokyo! When craving sushi it is a great price for the quantitiy! The quality is also outstanding. I would like the to bring my the Miami Roll for lunch however!"}
{"text":"I love sushi and, by the looks of the typical crowd, so does everyone else- and with good reason.   Mr. Tokyo is new, with modern decor and a friendly staff. Of course there's an actual sushi bar, though on the smaller size, and comfy booths and plenty of large tables.   After you're seated, you're given (the old school) check list menu, which I happen to like- and it's got a nice amount of variety.   My favorite is the hand rolled sushi that reminds me of a mini-bouquet of surreal flowers. The avocado is my usual choice.   There's more than just sushi, here. You can have hibachi or teriyaki beef, chicken, or shrimp with rice and vegetables.   No wrong choices, though, especially at around 20 bucks a head for all you care to eat, but don't waste it, they'll possibly charge you, according to the menu."}
{"text":"I came here during the all-you-can-eat time so that might have contributed to the poor review but my dining experience here was pretty horrible.  A little background of my food experience to begin with, I am from California and had plenty of authentic japanese food in Japan. That being said, there is a huge difference between American and japanese sushi but this restaurant neither tasted like japanese or American sushi; it just tasted cheap.   I ordered an edamame to start with, but took close to 15 mins. for it to come out. I understand if it was due to the business but then I discover a strand of pubic hair on top of the beans. Disgusted, I ask the waitress to get me a new one. Took another 15 mins and by that time we were already in the middle of our meal.  Handrolls were okay, probably the best things I could eat on the menu at the time. All the raw fish tasted very artificial, lacking the distinct flavor of each fish and tasted as if I was biting into a bland piece of fish.  Probably will not come here again and hope this review is helpful for first timers."}
{"text":"Love the buffet and sushi but don't like how they won't let you take home your left overs!   Other than that, this place is the bomb!"}
{"text":"All you can eat menu is not too limited at all! Plenty of options, EXCELLENT sushi, EXCELLENT hibachi flavor...like BOOM go the flavors in your mouth! The service was great for us, everything was well explained and we ate like animals. Keep it up Mr. Tokyo! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Eh....  I don't get the hype.  I went out of my way to get some takeout from here because of all the great ratings.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either.  I placed a togo order that they said would be ready in about 10 mins.  Showed up 10 mins later and still had to wait a little bit, but no big deal there, don't think it was much more than 15 mins total.  I ordered the Tuna Tataki, a small chicken habachhi and ditto for beef habachi.  I peaked in the bag when I got to my car and saw that the tuna was all grey looking.  I've never seen Tuna Tataki served this way, so I walked back in and asked and apparently that's how they do it there.  It was raw on the underside and sauce wasn't bad, but I won't be ordering it again.  The chicken Habachi was pretty good.  Small pieces of chicken and not a whole bunch of them, but tender.  The steak.....  Not so much.  Kind of chewy even.  I guess about what I should expect for an $8 dinner though.    My mom's teeth aren't that great and she ended up giving a couple pieces to the dog since she couldn't chew it.  I guess I need to go check out the lunch buffet to understand what all the hype is about.  I'd say better quality than some of the cheaper fast-food type habachi places, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Definitely highly Americanized Asian fare. The food and sushi were good but definitely far from the best I've had. I would say this is a solid dinner choice but certainly not a frequent stop."}
{"text":"Really great food and awesome service! Love this place! The all you can eat sushi selection is really great. Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Visited for lunch.  The All You Can Eat is a fabulous deal.  Tried the avocado and house salads which were good but nothing special.  I did like the ginger dressing which came on both.  Moved in to the vegetable tempura appetizer. It was awesome with 2 pieces of broccoli, zucchini and sweet potato with a nice dipping sauce. The rainbow roll was good but they're pretty standard everywhere.  Nigiri was fresh and generous...tried tuna salmon and octopus. Give them a try.  Liquor license is in the works so beware you can't get a drink yet."}
{"text":"Mr. Tokyo is still somewhat of a hidden gem, thankfully. Many of my friends have yet to hear about it, even though it's been around for over a year. Maybe because it's down in Pineville and not 'The City', but I'll take it!   Pretty simple here. It's an AYCE (all you can eat) establishment with a twist. Instead of your standard buffet style AYCE, everything is actually made to order, just as a regular sushi restaurant would. As of this review, it's up to $18.99/pp for dinner ($12.99 for lunch).   Appetizers: Mr. Tokyo Bowl (a must try), spring roll, & gyoza (dumplings). I'd skip the tempura and save room for the good good.   Sushi rolls: my favorites are: Sweet Heat, Carolina, Snow White & Charlotte rolls.   Pro Tip: While the hibachi is good (v. good, even) I'd recommend skipping this unless you're splitting with several people. Don't make the rookie mistake and fill up on the basic stuff."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and great menu options!! I found myself stuffed and satisfied by the end of the night! I would say be careful not to be too hungry when you get there because the food does take awhile to make. Overall I had a great experience and I will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Had to deduct a star because the sushi is not as flavorful. I also noticed that the fish is now being pre-sliced and laid out on blood soaked paper towels in display case. Unappealing. I understand this probably speeds up preparation, but it has also hindered the flavor. The appetizers, starters and salads remain tasty. The hype is a little bit over me, but still feel that this is a good deal for the price point. You get what you don't pay for :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Fresh made to order. Don't order too much or you get charged extra. I always get tuna rolls and tuna nigiri. Tuna hand roll, Gyoza is delicious, spring rolls nice and crispy, miso soup and clear soup are great. Rice is perfect. Lemon salmon roll is great with extra lemon if you are a lemon lover. And for those who enjoy spicy, the yellowtail jalapeño is for you. I always save the sauce to dip my sushi in. There is a large variety of appetizers and sushi rolls to choose from as well as hibachi."}
{"text":"I love going to Mr Tokyo! It's my favorite Japanese restaurant in the university area. I love the all you can eat menu because you only pay about $12 and you get unlimited hibachi, sushi, soups, and sides. It's definitely the best deal around."}
{"text":"I'm so excited about the plethora of new restaurants opening in Charlotte! I was especially excited for Mr. Tokyo when I learned about their concept. Think all you can eat, but delivered fresh, made to order right to your table and with friendly faces all along the way!  I believe Mr. Tokyo has only been opened for a few months, but I finally had the chance to stop by last night. I posted pictures of the menu, but dinner is $16.99 per person and again, all you can eat! The entire menu is included in the AYCE, but if you want sashimi instead of nigiri, there is a $.50 upcharge per piece. We ordered 33 pieces of nigiri between the two of us (2 red snapper, 4 escolar tuna, 10 salmon, 8 yellowtail, 5 tuna, 2 mackerel and 2 tofu skins), jalapeño yellowtail, Mr. Tokyo bowl (salmon with spicy crab meat and tobiko), edamame, agedashi tofu, gyoza, crab salad, seaweed salad, squid salad, miso soup, crab rangoon, chicken and shrimp teriyaki, red bean and green tea ice cream. To say the least, we got our money's worth.   I was most impressed with the quality and size of the nigiri! I highly recommend the salmon and escolar tuna. We would have paid at least $50 for the nigiri alone anywhere else. What a great deal! Of the apps that we tried, the agedashi tofu and Mr. Tokyo bowl were my favorite. I don't recommend the gyoza or the crab rangoon, but there were enough deliciousness in between to keep me satisfied. I posted pictures of the menu in case you're curious. Definitively give this place a try!   Can I come back now?!"}
{"text":"I have to give these guys a five star. The quality of food for the price of their buffet is unbeatable. I am here a few times a month and food and staff never disappoint me. I highly suggest u try their sushi. U will be impressed!!!"}
{"text":"Went there recently and this restaurant has stepped up its game! When I first ate here the staff looks unorganized and the food took ages to come out. Now I find myself here frequently! The best time I find to go is just after the lunch rush has died down so about 1:30 during the week. The food comes out fast and everyone is so friendly. The only thing I wish could happen is a bit of an explanation with some of the rolls like the difference between a hand roll and a classic roll. Otherwise all of the food is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"This was place was simply amazing! Meng was our waiter and he was awesome. We did the all you can eat and it was so yummy. I would recommend the Charlotte Roll!!! Yummy place! Def back again!"}
{"text":"Decently priced sushi and fairly fast and friendly service.  Wish they had more of a selection on the specialty rolls. OK place when you've got that craving but not necessarily if you're looking for a hot spot or some food to blow your mind."}
{"text":"I'm hooked. I've only checked in 4 times but I'm sure I've been here at least 6. Each time I get sushi rolls to go and each time I get home I fall more in love. The rolls are always so fresh and never falling apart. I'm anxious to go back and take advantage of the all you can eat sushi. When we went last night, the place was packed! People were waiting and tables were full! It was a nice buzz and they also play pretty good music.  They have a customer for life in me!"}
{"text":"We were not greeted or acknowledged for almost 10 minutes at 2pm.  When our presence was finally acknowledged, there was no greeting or smile.  The hostess must be an owners daughter or something because she was disturbing in many other ways as well.  We saw her pick up order sheets that she dropped onto the floor & then handle customer napkins twice!  She also put makeup on, touching her face, & never washed her hands.  There was never once a smile to anyone from her to anyone the entire time we were there.  This restaurant has only a 90 health score rating - for the last 2 inspections mostly due to cleanliness infractions.  If you look on the Mecklenburg county health department reports, you will be grossed out at what they observed, & continue to observe here.  The sushi was good - until I read the reports!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place for all you can eat sushi. I recommend going on weekdays since it can get crowded. Freshly made to order."}
{"text":"This is fair sushi not as fresh nor as well presented as the best sushi spots but a good value nonetheless... the problem lies with their Health Dept rating of 90 a mediocre score that is not what u want to see with a restaurant that serves raw fish."}
{"text":"Let's see, where to begin...  For starters, I have been to this restaurant more times in the last year than anywhere else. Why? They are an all you can eat, made to order sushi restaurant that is serving up some seriously good rolls, hibachi, and appetizers at a seriously good price. The staff is always friendly and quick and did I mention it is all you can eat? I believe I've subconsciously been avoiding writing this review to try and keep this spot quiet, however I'm pretty sure the word is out.  Previously, my only gluttonous experiences with sushi were related to Rusans, which is certainly a different atmosphere. Here you get a check card when you sit down and they will make your sushi/apps/hibachi to order. A few pro tips:  - Order everything you want at once. The place is always busy so it will take a bit to get to you.  - Don't order solely with your stomach. It's a lot of food and they can charge you for what you don't finish.  - Personal preference here, but don't order too many fried rolls. They really sit heavy. Some of my favorite rolls include the White Tiger, Rainbow, and Carolina.  - If with a large group, get them to put all the sushi rolls on one plate for impressive presentations and optimal sharing   I personally think you get more bang for your buck at lunch ($12) as you still get an expansive menu. It will take more than an hour to do (depending on the drive) and you will want to get there early. Dinner is also good ($17) and includes more items and sushi than what you will find at lunch. While I'm still scratching my head at how they make a profit, I look forward to continuing to work through their menu!"}
{"text":"17.99 for all you can eat sushi? I'm in!  They have some great rolls, just make sure to read all the description on what's included in the rolls to make sure you are ordering what you want.   Definitely get the house apps (salmon and yellowtail) that are only 1 order per person. They are 1 order per person for a reason! You can also get sashimi for extra .50 per piece - well worth it in my opinion.The apps are excellent - I always get the seaweed and calamari salad. Great choices.   Service speed is really slow - they don't have enough people making the rolls, and with the increase in popularity, demand far outpaces their speed. But when you do get the food, the quality is great.   Dessert selection is lacking, but if they have the mochi ice cream, i would recommend those as well."}
{"text":"Literally the best sushi I've had in a while. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Glad I made the decision to stop by."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the waiting too long. Also the waitress were rude, poor customer service they messed up our orders and get mad at us. Not coming anymore."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today... yup, the reviews were right. Lunchtime all you can eat sushi, made to order mind you, is legit!    You can order as much as you want, they only ask for you to be able to finish what you order. They will charge for extra. No problem for me, soup and a couple of rolls will work just fine.   The wait staff was very nice and attentive.  Overall, great experience for a sushi joint. I was a little bummed that sashimi isn't on the lunch menu, this is probably because there isn't any rice to fill you up.   Do it for lunch, and yes, show early because they get busy at 12:00."}
{"text":"Went for dinner this time.  Much less crowded,  less rushed, and expanded menu.  Better and different experience than at lunch.  The sushi apps (yellowtail and tokyo bowl) are my faves and were not an option at lunch.  Great variety of rolls.  Veggie tempura is great.  Wish you could get half rolls to try more variety.   Come with a group and you'll be golden for variety."}
{"text":"DH and I have been here 2x since their opening, and we've been thoroughly pleased. Food is great and fish is fresh.   One recommendation would be for a bit quicker wait staff."}
{"text":"I am already dying to go back to this cute place doing all the right things in Japanese food! The all you can eat concept is not new, but their set up is fantastic. The food tastes fresh, you get a bit of everything you want and the price is amazing. The hibachi steak was so tender, the gyoza was delish, the clear soup had just the right touch of fried onions, and I could ramble on... please try this restaurant because I need it to stay around!"}
{"text":"snow white roll and the (white meat roll?) something with crab and mango in it was so good.   slow service but worth it because they had such unique and fresh rolls. definitely a great sushi spot."}
{"text":"We met up with some friends for dinner and this was a good halfway point for us. Plus, who doesn't love some unlimited sushi? We were really excited because this one is unlimited sushi and hibachi, but also has legit rolls on there, not just your basic tuna roll.  The place is cute and stylish. The service started out quick and awesome. Honestly the service stayed pretty good the whole night... but our orders usually came wrong or didn't come at all. Since it's unlimited we ordered in stages so at times it just seemed as though some rolls were taking longer, but once we stopped ordering we still didn't receive them.   The rolls were decent, but since some of them were wrong it's hard to say completely. My boyfriend ordered some hibachi though and he said it was quite good.  Don't know that we'll go back, but it's not a terrible option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Wow! That's the first thing I can think of! Fresh! Tasty! Best sushi! Best food I've ever had! I will be back! The only bad part about it is that I live in Concord and they are in Matthews. I will be back. If you like spicy the ranchero roll was awesome. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Our second visit.  Disappointed.  Price increase during their infancy stage - not cool!  Reduced staff; and where was the crowd??  Maybe others have experienced the change as well.  Very different experience than last time.  You are given a paper menu and pencil and mark what you would like to have.  2 in our party marked the roll and wrote to leave an item off of their rolls.  Chef got both of those requests wrong!  One was an allergy, so had to get the chef to remake.  It was hard to get the food down this time so that we weren't charged additional fees.  Last time we were so impressed and the food was so good we didn't have a problem cleaning our plates."}
{"text":"I totally recommend Mr. Tokyo to anyone that likes fresh made to order sushi. The variety is great and it is amazing to have a place with such great appetizers. Price is fair and as it was already stated in other reviews getting an upcharge will only be your fault. Very nice and welcoming staff that treated us extremely well all times we had been there."}
{"text":"Awesome food! 100 every time I have come! I love the lunch special, how can you beat $12 for all you can eat sushi AND hibachi?! You can't! The food is so delicious that there is usually a 20 minutes wait, unless you can grab a spot at the bar. I have never ordered anything I didn't love! I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"YESSSS!!! DO IT! You've been thinking about eating here but the wait is to long?? All I can say is its worth the wait!  We went on a Sunday afternoon and we had the all you can eat sushi and hibachi. It was beyond delicious! The salmon nigiri was the best I've had in a while. The sushi is made as you order and everything is fresh. I reccomend any sushi lover to come here and try everything on the menu. I know I will when I come back."}
{"text":"Saw all the raving review here and checking out what it is all about.  The atmosphere is nice and clean.  The pop music is on the loud side.  their plating looks good and things goes down hill. 4*  Well, the sushi are made to order by 2 chiefs, this means a long wait time from order to food on the table.  Other places i have been had 4 chefs churning food out.  The food are blend.  I am not a soy sauce sushi guy and this place coverted me. 3*  The sea foods are sliced thin just liked fish baits.  Where is the taste of the fish? The rice portion is huge.  Speaking of the rice, it is not very well cooked.  You can sense each grain and the entire ball is hard to chew as I had to fight with them. 3*  Nice thing is their rice are warm. The seaweeds are crisp. 5*  I guess this is Charlotte."}
{"text":"One of the prize gems of Charlotte.  Although this isn't the cheapest all-you-can-eat sushi/sashimi place in Charlotte ($19), I will argue that it is the best bang for the buck. (During weekdays lunch it may be the cheapest and best @ $13)  The fish is fresh, the selection is diverse and generous, and everyone here just looks so satisfied! Being from DC where we don't have anything like this and having visited tampa which has Koizi (which is similar but not as good), I can tell you all that you are very lucky to have this Mr Tokyo.  Comparing it to Rusan's and Pisces, it seems much better even on the weekends where you have to pay a few more $. Rusan's only offers rolls and a very limited selection of nigiri (sushi) and Pisces was subpar overall.   There's usually a wait for this place but I highly highly recommend it. Service can be a bit hectic.   Taste: 5/5 Atmosphere: 3.5/5 (A bit hectic and crazy but it's not hard to catch a waiter/waitress) Value: 5/5"}
{"text":"I have to admit I was suspicious at first, 17.99 all you can eat, it must be bait. This place is great! Loved the Tokyo Bowl and the mango roll. The only knock I can give it is the service slowed down for a while, but I was 7:30 and the place was packed with a line waiting to get in. Since we left California 9 years ago, I have been searching for decent sushi, and thanks be, I have found it!"}
{"text":"When I say I love Mr. Tokyo!! I mean I love it. We may come here 2-3 days a week. The food is so fresh. The restaurant is very clean. All you can eat for 18.99. They have everything from sushi to hibachi meals. The spring rolls are my favorite!! I have nothing but good things. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This place is a steal and actually exceeded my expectations to be honest. Had a friend who always talks about this place but I'm so stuck on my typically hibachi spots I would typically turn the invitation down. Luckily for her I want sushi so bad that I didn't care where I went lol I didn't realize this place has a deal to where you can order as many dinner items as you like as long as you stick to the limited menu provided. However, to be honest the \"limited\" menu isn't really limited at all just a few reasonable items here and there like sushi rolls with the more selective seafood I guess you could say. I was hungry so I took on the challenge though. I ordered 2 apps of spring rolls, 1 app of crab Rangoon, miso soup, and 2 chef speciality sushi rolls(crazy roll and mr Tokyo roll) and I was beyond stuffed and super satisfied. I now see why she loves this place and I will be recommending it as well to others!"}
{"text":"There was a bit of a wait for us to get in on a Thursday night but from reading previous reviews I expected this.  The wait staff was phenomial. Everyone was suuuper nice and helpful. The sushi was good and they had a decent variety of rolls to choose from. Over great experience"}
{"text":"Found my new favorite place. The food was yummy and the sushi was delicious. So worth the money & definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Always great food. Been here many times. Always busy and with lots of \"natives\" too (that's always nice to see when i eat at different ethnic restaurants) Service could be more attentive. We had to ask for too many basics like chop stix, napkins, plates etc"}
{"text":"If you like Japanese food, this is the perfect spot for you!!! They have an all you can eat menu on the weekends and also Mon-Fri dinner. This place is different from every Japanese restaurant that I have been in town. You write your name on the menu then you make your choices, it doesn't matter how much you order you will always pay $18,99 and they also have ice cream for free. (It is not on the menu though you have to ask for it) As you can see in my picture they have all kinds of options, from salad to hibachi and everything is delicious!  I always order squid salad, it is one of the best squids that I've ever had in my life.  Everything is made per order and it's fresh as it could be. The service is great, the place is clean and the food does not take long to be served. I have been going to this place for a year now and every time I want to have a blast with Japanese food  this is the place that I go to.  Besides the squid salad my favorites are cheese rangoon, shrimp tempura, steak hibachi with veggies, octopus, shrimp and salmon nigiri and the missô soup. They also have their regular menu in case your are not in the mood for the all you can eat menu. They do not take reservations and they are always packed so if you want to go on the weekends specially for dinner you need to get there early. But even if you have to wait it won't be for long and it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I promised to myself to be very fair and cautious on this review since I love Mr. Tokyo on Paneville-Matthews and their aren't favorite Japanese restaurant in the States! So they just opened this location and my husband and I decided to try it out. The place is way bigger than the other one, so many tables and they even have a space outside that will be great when Spring/Summer comes and you also do not feel cramped at all. The decoration is very nice, the place was clean and organized. The service was the same as the one on Pineville-Matthews and the food just amazing as it could be. They have the all you can eat buffet as well and we ordered what we always do on their other location to compare quality of the food that was outstanding as always. However we had two disappointments in this location. My husband and I ordered a beef hibachi each, they took forever to get done and when they served it to me it was COLD, which makes me believe my food was done way before they brought it to me and was just sitting in the kitchen for a while until they realize they needed to serve it.  At the Pineville-Matthews location you can have ice cream for free, at the new one they have more options but you have to pay for it. The problem is not that they do not serve free desserts, because I believe people go there for the good not desserts but if they are the same restaurant they need to provide same service and same menu. Even though this location is closer to me I will not be back, I will keep going to the Pineville-Matthews restaurant."}
{"text":"Go shopping cars with my friend, found this place is near by. Tried $12.5 unlimited order at lunch, not that great but hope regular menu will be better. The restaurant is pretty packed at lunch time so I will give it a second try when I am around that area again."}
{"text":"All you can eat but not from a buffet!! You order from a menu, whatever you want, and they make it fresh!! The food is outstanding and the environment is quaint. It's a little small and tucked away but well worth a visit! We had a great experience and will being going back asap :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. I go about once a week. Sushi is very fresh and tasty. Sushi sometimes takes awhile when ordering off all you can eat and they will charge you for extra pieces!! So make sure and order only what you will eat! I only order one roll at a time and most rolls are 8 pieces. Service is a hit or miss depending on who waits on you. Ive been before and had great service and other times very poor service. Some of the servers tend to be very awkward and act like it's their first day. Wish they made the rolls in 4 pieces instead of a full 8 so you could try different ones on the all you can eat."}
{"text":"Come here if you are very hungry or with a big group. That way you can rally maximize your order. I liked that you can get hibachi alongside all you can eat made to order sushi. Everything is solid. Not the best or worst food you'll ever get but fills you up and scratches the itch for hibachi steak and sushi. Additional charge for nigiri and make sure to clearly indicate if you want no sauce or on the side. If you are doing all you can eat it's not a good look to send something back and they may not let you."}
{"text":"This place has unlimited sushi! You pay pretty much the price of what 2 rolls would be but you get so much more. The price includes appetizers, hand rolls, main dishes dish as fried rice, and of course sushi. They have a wide variety of items to choose from. I would highly recommend going in a group for this place. Just be aware there is a surcharge for any unfinished sushi. So order in small increments. You can always order more."}
{"text":"I would eat at Mr. Tokoyo's everyday if I could! Just ate there 2 days in a row and I'm not sorry bout it! They have the best sushi and hibachi in North Carolina! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Bad service! Monday we ate there. We waiting about more than 15 mins for ASK THEM a drinks. And filled the Sushi paper and the server lost   a paper. Filled up against. Never came back!!!!!! Finished a lunch need more than two hours.........."}
{"text":"This place is the best sushi place in charlotte! I love this place. All you can eat!? It doesn't get better! They have an extensive menu with options for everyone. The spring rolls are to die for. I love that the portions are small and you can keep ordering as you go. Just keep in mind they charge for any wasted food. Also, it seems like this place is always packed I like that they have an online wait list that will let you know when you are next in line and gives you an options for a couple more minutes if you went shopping at a near by store."}
{"text":"Ugh... I don't want to write this review because I want to keep Mr. Tokyo off the map for selfish reasons. I've been twice now and both times were excellent. The price is so right (honestly, I think they should raise their prices!) and the quality is phenomenal. It's an AYCE style restaurant but you can also order a la carte. It really doesn't make sense not to do the AYCE option. Sushi lovers will be able to indulge in specialty rolls and sushi, while people who prefer their food cooked will have plenty of options too.   The service is friendly and attentive. Just remember to eat all the food you order. They will charge you for any waste.   Beware: The restaurant can get very busy but it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"As somebody who lived in Japan for 3.5 years, I know good Japanese food. And while Mr. Tokyo might not be the most authentic of Japanese cuisine, it's still pretty darn good. The all you can eat lunch is surprisingly cheap for what all you can get. The hibachi style rice is to die for and their wide range of sushi options will leave you satisfyingly full every single time. In addition to the food, they offer a wide variety of Asian drinks from Sapporo to Sake to my personal favorite, Asahi. I can't say enough good things about this unique dining experience and I can't wait to go back next time!"}
{"text":"This place was SO good.   The only problem we had was that my husband ordered 4 pieces of sashimi (an extra .50 each) and he only received 2. We thought the other 2 pieces would come out after, since everything seemed staggered, and we mentioned that we didn't get some of our order and our server told us that he did get sashimi because of the garnish on the plate. We weren't saying we didn't get it, we just didn't 2 pieces of the squid sashimi, yet we were still charged for it. Since it was only $1 we didn't push it, but if you order sashimi, make sure you get it before you start eating.    However, with that small issue aside, the food was great. The rolls were very big and very fresh. The quality was excellent. The service was also great and our server removed dishes and filled our water glasses frequently. The BBQ squid was a bit overcooked for my taste, but my husband liked it.   Overall, we will definitely come back. You can't beat $17 for the selection and quality of food they have."}
{"text":"Mr Tokyo was pretty cool. The unlimited sushi and hibachi was calling my name. I was really excited to check this place out. Our food came out quickly I had the crab Rangoon's , spring rolls, salmon roll, tuna roll and The Miami roll and Teriyaki shrimp which came with rice and veggies! I ate during lunch and the price is $12.99.  The servers were friendly. Unless you are seated at a booth you will have to share a table with other people which wasn't a problem to me. I wish that there was a more diverse menu for the chef special rolls. I don't like imitation crab in my sushi rolls and almost all of the special rolls have imitation crab.  Also I'm not a big fan of sushi rolls with cream cheese most of the chef special rolls have either or both. So I just got Miami roll because there was no crab and I just pushed the majority of the cream cheese out with my chopstick. This is more of a preference. I would definitely come back again. All in all I had a great experience I will be back"}
{"text":"Everyone was so respectful and tedious, especially the manager!  I believe his name was Ben?  They gave great service and the food was outrageously good.  Will go back again"}
{"text":"Awesome high quality all you can eat sushi menu that also has a lot of non sushi kitchen menu items included!    The only down side is that it takes a long time to get your food when re-ordering additional items.   We learned that it is better to order as much as you will eat on the 1st round so that you will not feel full just by waiting for your additional rounds of food to come.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love eating here. The sushi is great and it's a great price. I'm such a picky eater when it comes to sushi and everything I've tried here has been wonderful. Me and my gfs eat here at least once a week since we learned about it. Try the Miami roll if you're eating at lunch and the tempura shrimp appetizer if you're eating at dinner!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best AYCE sushi restaurants I have been to her in Charlotte. I've came here a handful of times and every time has been great. The service is fast and the sushi is fresh. If you're not familiar with Mr. Tokyo it's an AYCE hibachi and sushi restaurant. I can't vouch for the hibachi as I've never had it, but their sushi is pretty bomb. And the best part is that it's NOT a buffet. The sushi is made fresh and made to order. And for $18 a person for dinner you really can't beat it.  For starters I always get a spring roll and the Mr. Tokyo bowl, which is limited one per person. The Mr. Tokya bowl is spicy crab goodness wrapped in salmon and it's dynamite! It's a must order every time.   My husband and I usually split 5 speciality rolls (woof I know) here and our favorites are the Panther roll (which I didn't see on the menu last time- sadness) and the Snow White roll. The Sweet Heat roll is also a personal favorite with avocado and spicy tuna.   Since the release of the Charlotte Agenda article on this place they have been packed so make sure you come ready to wait on the weekends. However, their bar (sits 4) is open on a first come- first served basis. We sat up there once and it was fine- better than waiting an hour."}
{"text":"Came based on the food reviews.  Not bad. Not great. Seems to be a focus on quantity over quality. I get that, it's just not what I look for when I go out for sushi."}
{"text":"The BEST HIBACHI IN NC/SC you can get. All you can eat option with deliciously grilled steak, shrimp, chicken- you name it. You want sushi? You got it. Food is HOT, comes out quick, and is high quality. You can also get side items like dumplings and shrimp tempura.   If you lift weights, come eat here post workout. Gains will be off the charts."}
{"text":"$11.99 for all you can eat sushi? Heck yes! The sushi was really yummy. We tried gyoza (love), the Snow White roll, Miami, sweet potato roll, and the dragon. Service was very efficient and attentive. We were quite surprised at the high quality of food for the cost. Would certainly recommend."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi. Outstanding.  I like the concept. For under $20 you will fill up on sushi."}
{"text":"Tried carry out from Mr. Tokyo today. Ordered the hibachi chicken. Ingredients were very fresh & the fried rice was pretty good. My only minor complaint is that the chicken had very little flavor as compared to other places I frequent. The food was above average, nothing to write home about but I will definitely try them again. The staff was very friendly & the decor is very welcoming. Will be trying the sushi next."}
{"text":"Second time at Mr Tokyo. Biggest findings: try their Mr Tokyo Bowl and Yellowtail Jalapeño. The essentially are sashimi, and are included in the AYCE price. The catch is they both are 1 order per person. Still happy."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. The price is very affordable for lunch $11.99. I got the all you can eat option.   The rice to fish ratio was very off balance. For the nigiri pieces as they put too much rice for the amount of fish.   The rolls was good balance with rice to ingredients. Enjoyed that although some rolls was pretty bland and needed some kind of sauce to punch up the flavors  The apps was pretty good for what it was.   After all it is all you can eat. So they have to make money some how."}
{"text":"I took Hubs here for his birthday after reading raving reviews from my fellow Yelpers, but I wasn't blown away. The restaurant is in a strip mall, but we have had many yummy sushi dinners in strip malls, so we didn't care about that.   We did have to wait 40 minutes to get a table, so I was really excited about the rolls. Once we were seated, our waitress was very attentive and sweet. We ordered 4 rolls since they do All-You-Can-Eat for one price. This is great if you can eat a lot of sushi, but if you only want one or two rolls, it's not worth it. It was decent sushi, but not the greatest I've ever had. I wouldn't make the trip down to Pineville just to go here again."}
{"text":"Better than RuSans!  In fact it was the second best sushi I've had in my life (nothing beats Dragonfly in Orlando). I took my family there last night. We have some picky eaters but that wasn't the case with Mr Tokyo. All of the food was fresh and we kept ordering more and more and more and... Needless to say I will be a regular. And the best part? It's less than a mile from my house. And don't judge a book by its cover. The location is not flashy but the inside decor is exquisite. Extremely clean. Better than surrounding restaurants like Nakato etc. And when they say all you can eat they really mean it. This means everything!! The soup, salad, appetizers, special rolls, you name it! Right now they charge an extra 50 cents for sashimi per order. I hope they change that in the future. If you live anywhere close to south Charlotte do yourself a favor and checkout Mr. Tokyo."}
{"text":"(4/28/18) My wife noticed something important about the kitchen entree selections at the top of the all you can eat menu.For the entrees under Teriyaki, Hibachi, or Tempura you are given the choice of steak, shrimp or chicken. You are also given the choice of not having vegetables or rice. If you choose shrimp tempura, without veggies and rice, you are given three fairly large shrimp. But if you order the hibachi shrimp you get a small serving of popcorn shrimp. She made the discovery trying to eat all of the entree without having to pay the uneaten charge.  The proteins by themselves are cooked well and are accompanied by a good tasting dipping sauce. I try to eat something that I haven't had before every time I eat there. This time I tried the mackerel nigiri. Wow! Talk about a fishy tasting fish! The taste and smell brought back memories of growing up in a New England seaport. It really livened up my palate as well. My wife's only comment was that only I and the dog enjoy mackerel.  The hostesses seemed glad to see me again. They kept asking me where I'd been and that I had to come by more often."}
{"text":"I walked in excited to try this restaurant. It wasn't busy in there and I waited patiently at the wait stand to be greeted and seated... To no avail. I have no problems spending money for food elsewhere and that's unfortunate that I had to do so after reading all of the positive reviews."}
{"text":"Quality seafood for a great price! Best part? UNLIMITED and it's made to order so you're guaranteed fresh items every time. Would suggest to get there a little earlier than the usual meal rushes as you will have to wait a bit for a table. So worth it though!"}
{"text":"Pretty good quality sushi. Been here 3 times, and happy with service and food every time. Only tip is to be careful, if u want to order sashimi, it's 50 cents Xtra if you do the all u can eat"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi, amazing service, super fresh. Once they get their beer license, this will be a true 5-star experience.   Try the yellowtail with jalapeño!"}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite place for sushi simply because the quality of sushi and the pricing of it. It's ALL YOU CAN EAT!!! I got 3 rolls and they were all sooo good. Especially the sweet potato roll. My mom ended up eating 5 rolls!!! And it's only $18.99 per person as long as you finish what you order. The crab rangoons are delicious. I wish that I would have found this place when I lived closer in Charlotte. Now I live an hour and half away, but I'll definitely drive the distance just for the sushi!!!"}
{"text":"The fish tasted very fresh.  A little more than the ideal amount of sushi rice with the nigiri.  At just $10.99 for AYCE lunch, it's amazing value.  (Consider that at most sushi restaurants, that wouldn't even buy you two rolls.)  Age tofu is 3 pieces per order; gyoza is 6 pieces per order.  There's also soups and salads.  Nigiri is 1 piece per order; rolls are 8 pieces per order.  I was pleased to see the selection of specialty rolls, which to me are more interesting than nigiri.  There's a wide variety even off the lunch menu, with some rolls featuring shrimp tempura or avocado or cream cheese or multiple kinds of tobiko (roe).  They are artfully crafted by the sushi chefs at the bar.  Friendly service, but order turnaround is slow when it's busy.  Makes sense since there's only three sushi chefs.  As a result, it's a little time-consuming to do multiple rounds, unless you order the next round before you empty the current plate.  If they can keep the AYCE price this low, I would definitely come back.  Food:  4 stars Value:  5 stars Service:  3.5 stars Overall:  4.5 stars"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Mr. Tokyo for the first time today and it was amazing. I've never been somewhere that is such a good value. Everything we tried was extremely fresh and delicious and where else can you find appetizers, sushi and hibachi all made fresh for 11.99! Service and atmosphere were great too. Can't wait to go back =)"}
{"text":"Very nice and cozy setting. Food taste great, i5 had the chicken fried rice, hubby had teriyaki chicken, and  both were delicious.  Will definitely go back there. Waitress was nice and helpful, they also have a  buffet and a  regular menu. The one catch is if you order stuff from the buffet menu, and you don't finish it, the charges you extra for it, that's the only bad thing I can say about it. Beside that I would definitely recommend this place to eat."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi dinner $18.99 and the sushi is awesome! Great quality and a large diverse menu, this will be our new sushi spot for sure!  Fast service also, we were eating in under 10 mins from ordering. My favorite was the deep blue roll and their crab rangoon's were also top notch!"}
{"text":"Beside their sushi, they have excellent quality dishes like their teriyaki steak. Their customer service is on point."}
{"text":"When I saw all you can eat hibachi and sushi and I had to go and try this place. The restaurant is nice and clean. Even with plenty of tables available there was about a 15-20 minute wait on a Friday night for 2 people. Once we were finally seated the waitress was very nice and explained to us everything on the menu was all you can eat for the $18.95 price which includes, appetizers, salads, soup, sushi rolls and hibachi, rice and noodles. So immediately we started ordering everything not paying attention to the fine print at the bottom of the menu that stated, we would be charged $.50 for each piece of sushi roll left over and a charge for large amounts of food left over. So we skimmed down our order to pace ourselves and not a fee. We started out with the crab wontons and spring rolls, both were really good and came out quickly.  We order 2 sushi rolls, the Charlotte roll and the Rainbow roll. Both rolls were really good and probably my 2 favorite out of the 4 rolls we ordered. Rolls were fresh and good combinations, we had no trouble eating all of those 2 rolls. The next 2 rolls we ordered was the Dynamite roll and the Crazy Roll. I was not a fan of the Dynamite roll, the texture and just the combination of ingredients were not good to me. Now that roll was hard to eat all of and I just took the risk of not eating all of the roll leaving about 2 or 3 pieces of it on the plate but I did not get charged.  Overall the sushi was good but I don't know if it was good enough to pay an all you can eat price when I am usually only capable of eating 2 maybe 3 rolls shared with someone else. Definitely a great place for someone who can eat many pieces of sushi on their own."}
{"text":"We went right after their grand opening, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they had just opened and probably still have some service/training to tighten up.  SERVICE: 2 stars - We ordered the all-you-can-eat dinner for four. Ordered 2 rounds and each round, there was something missing. Additionally, our waitress didn't speak English very well, so we'd start with asking her, then eventually always have to ask the main guy who spoke better English. Lastly, we had several dishes, but as they were finished, the waitress would come by and fill up our drinks but wouldn't think to take our dirty dishes, so they stacked up several times.  FOOD: 3 stars - at first, maybe it was bc we were hungry, it was good/ok. But by the 2nd round, the food seemed to be pretty bland and flavor range seemed limited, the food was either 1. COVERED in eel sauce 2. covered in avocado or rice   With that said, $17-18 pp is SUPER cheap for all you can eat, so I'm willing to give this place another chance when I come back to Charlotte!  Best of luck to you guys! Recommend offering all you can drink and eat option (beer + Sake for sake bombs) at the higher price!"}
{"text":"Second visit since their grand opening. I went last night 9/19/17 with my well behaved 6 month old and his father, John, who is severely allergic to avocados and that's where things slid down the awkward slope.   I'm a friendly somewhat sushi snob so coming for all you can eat sushi is both exciting but a little unsure, because I've been told by sushi chefs else where that it's not the \"freshest\" quality. But a star because I feel fine, I'm not dead, not even a tummy ache so I believe they must have done good. I did semi-wolf down the food because I wanted to be mindful of getting out on time. We arrived around the 8:30 window (give or take), ordered by 8:42 ish and they close by 9:30.   So back to the death trap ingredient. We tell our young male server of this, and he kindly took extra care and notice of it and informs the chefs, then returns to say they'd like us to check off our card all at once so it's a one shot thing. We get that they don't want to have to clean their knives every time baby daddy orders something. It's a little time consuming and we're aware avocado is apart of half the sushi menu or it's well requested. But we were scared to over do it & wanted to abide by their \"no waste\" policy, but thankfully one take was good enough & that wasn't the problem. We're good with 8 pieces of nigiri, 4 spring rolls, 1 green salad, 1 chk+shr hibachi entree, 4 sushi rolls.  Then it seemed like that set the tone for the rest of the bad bad night aka 45 min.  Our food comes out oddly slow. His salad comes out first, cool, then he notices the sushi chefs are gone at the same time and no one is making anything for awhile, maybe they're all eating and we're just waiting... Then Nigiri comes out, couldn't find our guy so kindly asked young girl server close by for spicy mayo. I can do without so I'm happily eating and then 5 minutes later the girl is sitting at the employee's table, for their worker's group dinner together of  4+ along with who looks like a manager and is 2 tables away from us, close enough to see us trying to get someone's attention because, well, no sauce. John is confused and wants to eat but prefers the mayo and I'm awkwardly chomping in front of him.Then our only roll we replaced the avoc for cuke comes (White something roll) and we kindly ask our guy for spicy mayo only to find him 2 minutes later to be at the bar showing a guest something on his phone & talking and doesn't come back ever with the sauce. Now John after waiting and tolerating doesn't care to stay or pay any longer but I try to convince him it might get better. He's in this industry so he notices a lot but is very reasonable. The spring rolls comes by a third person, different young girl & John apologizes to her for having to ask for this golden sauce that her other 2 overly glorified co workers couldn't manage. I believe they must have thought we expected them to go dig a golden nugget and melt it down for us to dip but we're the thankful the 3rd girl gets it. Our original server decides to appear for a tea refill and John lets him know don't worry someone else got the sauce but server disregards and again asks for the tea only to come back and thud it back on the table and walk away, coward petty move young boy. John was only putting off eating while patiently waiting for what he asked for three times. That's what I get for making us stay when we should've walked out because obviously that was the last attitude we needed. But now we're in the \"we've been here this long, we're stuck now but would love to not be\" part of the night. The hibachi comes back partially burnt but it finally came so not bothering them to do it again and wait forever after the mood that already set in. The rest of the sushi finally makes it which were Charlotte Roll, Crazy Roll and Dynamite. Not in favor of the fried batter of the Crazy and Dynamite, not bad but if that's your type of roll then go for it, it was more to get down then we expected and left some. Server comes quickly to ask if we're good and inform that 9:15 is last call for orders, which was fine because we're stuffed. He comes by quickly again but doesn't stay for an answer,  just zooms. I'm very fed up at this point and hate to waste time and get no where because the whole place seemed very disorganized and careless and I just wanted to get out of there.   Summarized Cons: The strange order of food after the salad. We would think the hot food is easier to come out first but didn't. It was jumbled up in the mix of our sushi that took even longer to come out. The constant ignoring and forgetting of your guests. I have been in customer service for 14 years, and there's no way I would be so careless of my customers or unapologetic. Atmosphere wasn't professional. It doesn't take a lot to make right but they didn't care."}
{"text":"If you're looking for sashimi, the Mr. Tokyo Bowl and Hamachi Jalepeno are fresh and delicious. Unfortunately, they are not on the AYCE lunch menu."}
{"text":"I have to admit - when I read \"all you can eat sushi....I paused a minute thinking - could this really be any good? What about the quality?   Well - here's the deal. It's amazing!! The service was terrific to start. The team helped us understand the process, the menu and made some great recommendations.   The sushi was terrific! And, our kids were able to have udon noodles, spring rolls and even ice cream for dessert!   When you factor in all that you get - the price & experience was amazing. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Mr. Tokyo serves all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch and dinner with hibachi and a few appetizers on the menu as well. Do yourself a favor and go for an early lunch or a late one. Never go around noon, unless you enjoy waiting 30+ minutes.  FOOD There's not much to say here. There is an abundance of sushi choices on the menu, and I would rate the quality being just a hair over what you might get at a grocery store. I enjoyed it. Pro tip: they have ice cream that is included in your all-you-can-eat price. Don't forget it!  SERVICE Service is decent. The issue is that Mr. Tokyo never has more than two or three guys making sushi, which of course slows everything down. Just make sure to order two or three rolls at once and you should be good.  PRICES $12 for lunch, $18 for dinner. I would say those are fair. If you eat three rolls, the all-you-can-eat prices have paid for themselves.  If you're coming here for world class sushi, you'll be disappointing, but if you just want some decent sushi for fair prices, this is your place. I love it."}
{"text":"I guess with all my check-ins here it's time for me to sing some praises.   I know what you're thinking, AYCE sushi? Is it any good? There must be a catch....  This isn't like some of the other places that just do AYCE sushi for lunch with small skimpy rolls, this my friends is the real deal. Please BRING YOUR APPETITE!     I never thought an AYCE place would have some of the best sushi in Charlotte but it does. I feel like I just ghosted New Zealand cafe and Umai.....   If you are a sushi lover put this on your must try list. You will never find a better deal, AYCE for the price of one or two rolls anywhere else. The rolls are fresh, made to order and are regular size. They don't hold back, they have regular rolls (I'm never dissapointed with their spicy tuna), but they offer a variety of specialty rolls as well. The Phoenix Maki is a favorite of mine that you can get any time of the day. But the best rolls are on the dinner menu that is priced at 16.99 and you can't go wrong. Do yourself a favor and try the Sweet Heat roll and the Charlotte roll.... sooo good!   Now I'm hungry....."}
{"text":"I love sushi, and I can put down a lot of food.  So this place was made for me.  Went with my dad and brother on a Sunday.  All day buffet for $17.  Walked in, and the staff was very nice and welcoming.  They cleared a space for us immediately when we wanted a booth.  Very attentive, I always had a full glass of water.  No complaints about the service at all.  Now... the food. Sashimi you have to pay $0.50 extra per piece, but you don't have to for the Nigiri.  So we got a lot of that.  My favorite is the mackerel, and it was good.  Eel was good too.  I've gotta say, these guys have presentation on point.  Depending on how many pieces of nigiri you have, they lay them out on the plate nicely.  Good artistic use of space.  The appetizers:  BBQ squid was on point, nice and spicy, I wish I took a picture of it.  Agedashi tofu good.  Tempura was alright.  My dad got more tofu afterwards.  The rolls:  Standard, 8 pieces per order.  Spicy tuna, spicy crab, spicy salmon, sweet potato tempura, yellowtail, eel rolls all pretty good.  Above average buffet sushi.  You can order special rolls from their buffet sushi as well, and that's where they shined.  I only got the Mr. Tokyo roll.  It has black tobiko and MANGO on/in it.  I flipped out.  Really nice looking, delicious pieces of sushi.  My only regret is not ordering those from the start.  Next time I go, I'll definitely make up for my mistake.  Overall, a great experience.  My dad honestly isn't that big a fan of Japanese food, and he was like, \"Let's do this again before you leave for school.\"  I leave in two weeks.  I would've given this a 4 out of 5, because I've had a better sushi buffet in Raleigh.  But this place also overlaps a PokeStop.  And it got lured.  TWICE.  5 out of 5."}
{"text":"We visited Mr.Tokyo last night for the first time and I must say this place is really good.Everything was cooked to perfection and the seafood was really fresh.My homemade ginger dressing and shrimp sauce had a unique taste as well.The prices are reasonable.They have an all you can eat option wherein the portion sizes are smaller but nonstop.From my understanding,that option costs $18 but if you don't finish one of your portions they will charge you a separate fee.   Heads Up:We visited on a Thursday and there was a 30 min wait;however,they do have bar seating (approx 8 chairs)."}
{"text":"So bummed...was actually looking to treat my parents to a Japanese style dinner. We greeted the hostess and she added our party of three to the waiting list. First of all she added my name wrong. After waiting for an hour and asking how much longer they said it would be another 30min. On top of that the hostess was a bit rude as we tried to figure out why we were getting placed further behind. It seems they made a mistake and as they were busy we weren't as important since someone had made a mistake and not apologized for it. We left promptly after canceling and left. Being from LA, it was probably the best decision since we didn't feel welcomed to the establishment and the since the service lacked class, assumed the food would follow suit. :("}
{"text":"Great place to eat! We love going and getting the \"all you can eat\" menu so we can try different things. Each item is freshly prepared and not from a buffet. Lots of great sushi rolls and delicious hibachi dinners. Only thing to note is that you are charged for anything you order and can't finish, which is a little stressful for when you do want to be adventure and try something new. Besides that we love this place. Bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant whenever we're back in Charlotte. My daughter and I keep saying \"It's not Mr. Tokyo\" when we try another all you can eat Japanese restaurant anywhere else. Everything I've ordered at Mr Tokyo's is fresh and delicious, from the rangun to the hibachi and the sushi. The wait staff is attentive, the presentation beautiful."}
{"text":"Rolls fell part before even bringing them up to my mouth. Would like a firmer roll. It was just average."}
{"text":"I love Mr Tokyo! They are the only place I have found that offers ayce sushi that is a great price and quality. They are different than a sushi buffet in that you sit down and put your order on little slips of paper that have all the sushi offerings. The waitress then takes the slip and the chefs make it for you fresh. I feel like this definitely results in better qualty sushi and they are very fast even though my boyfriend and I always order like three giant plates...haha...   There are appetizers, entrees, rolls, and nigiri you can choose from. Appetizers are pretty standard asian restaurant ones like edamame and crab rangoons. Entrees include hibachi. For rolls there are basic rolls and more elaborate rolls. You can ask for the basic rolls to be hand rolls, which is what I do! The nigiri is great and they have a wide selection. You can choose for any of the nigiri to be sashimi but it is an extra 25 cents.   Total is it $13/person for lunch and $18/person for dinner. They will charge you if you have leftovers."}
{"text":"First visit of many more to come. Very good sushi. And it's even better at the price for all you want. I was impressed when I walked in as I did expect it to be so nice. Very comfortable. Greeted right away. Just check off what you'd like from the menu. Questions, just ask. My next surprise was when I saw how generous the servings were. Not all rice, to fill you up. Good selection of rolls. Now the service, it was outstanding also. I wish the name of our server was on the recipient,but it's not. She was great. Got there at noon and the place was busy but still didn't have long wait to get our food coming. It's not a very large place so be prepared for a possible wait. But we'll worth it. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Sushi fanatic here!!!! I absolutely love sushi. Doesn't matter what it is. NOM NOM!!! Have been here twice already. Once for din din and then another for lunch. This place is amazing. Everything comes out super fresh. It's made on the spot when you order it. The best part.....you can eat as much as you want. Great selection of items. I was quite surprised.   Great for a big group or just by yourself. Had a great time and left super full."}
{"text":"One of the best all you can eat places. They bring out the food quite fast even when it is super busy. The only downside is the wait, and service but keep in mind it is an all you can eat place. The rolls are really decent with varying selections."}
{"text":"Very very slow!   Been setting here over and hour and still no food.  Place is practically empty!  Not a good first impression  regardless of the food quality! Probably will not be back!   Update :  hour and 15 minutes and what a big let down.  Food quality was just ok !   We will  not be back!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here. They are great for lunch. The food is served quickly and the portions are spot on.  My wife and son both complained that they didn't use sushi rice or even rice vinegar. But for me it was okay.  The only complaint I have is they don't have any Asian waitresses."}
{"text":"I'm not giving this place any stars I refuse to. I came to this place for lunch with a few co workers. We sat down ordered our food one of my co workers orders was incorrect. I ordered at the same time as my co workers they all got their food at the same time. The waitress came and left our table about five times. After 15 minutes pass I ask if my sushi rolls are ready. The waitress asked me what I ordered I was confused as I ordered the same time as everyone else and it was on the slip. She told me my order will take a little longer. I didn't understand as nothing I ordered was cooked and I only ordered one roll. I told her what I ordered expecting it to be made. She came back to the table two more times to ask me what I had and told me my order takes longer. Moral of the story is I didn't get my food and the waitress didn't want to take responsibility for not putting in my order she kept telling me my order takes longer. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We can't get enough of this restaurant. We drive up from SC and try to stop anytime we are passing through. Unlimited, fresh, made to order sushi! Great presentation of plates and wonderful taste."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for dinner tonight.  The rolls were fresh and well made.  Live the all you can order concept for a set price.  Highly recommend the Angel Hair roll and the squid salad."}
{"text":"This place is great. Not only is it all you can eat sushi but other dishes are available as well. It's not just limited sushi like other all you can eat places- there are special rolls top. The staff is nice, accommodating and attentive. The crab rangoon were not just cream cheese and crab - different but delicious. The portions are small but that helps you to try more things! You can't miss with Mr. Tokyo."}
{"text":"Okay. As much as I like sushi, I'm really upset no one has ever mentioned this place. Granted it's an hour+ away, but it is an hour I might actually drive for this place on occasion.  First off, let's just get this out of the way. This Sushi is an amazing quality! I've had sushi this good before, but never at an all-you-can-eat type place. The sushi melted in your mouth. I was amazed! Even the fried rolls felt delicate and perfectly fluffy. I'm not even sure how they achieved it! The fish all tasted extremely fresh. And the flavor combinations were excellent with so many options.  And speaking of options, I think it's time to discuss the all-you-can-eat aspect. At only $19 for the evening, it's already a steal if the sushi is at all good. But I already attested to how good it was Beyond expectations. But then you throw in the fact that it has so many options and it's unbelievable. Tons of normal cooked food options and appetizers including a really special Sushi appetizer you can only order one of per person at a time. It was layered fish and looked like a flower. Several different kinds of salads including seaweed salad. And the variety of roles in particular was remarkable.  To top it off our waiter was a lot of fun and helpful when discussing different types of sushi and their specialties. He was very friendly and engaging and made it even better. I'm not surprised this place is as well-reviewed as it is."}
{"text":"I forgot to tell you that I ordered off the dinner menu.   And it was wonderful.   If you go in for lunch on the weekends, they give you the dinner menu. Dinner is priced at $16.99 for all you can eat, fresh, made to order sushi and various items - there is still hibachi for the ones that don't love sushi, don't fret. Whenever special things are saved for a dinner menu, I try to order those so that I don't miss out on anything. On this menu, among other things, you'll find the Charlotte roll, Sweet Heat roll and the TOKYO BOWL (this one is in the sushi appetizer section). The Tokyo Bowl should definitely be the one that you kick your meal off with - it's fresh, large slices of salmon wrapped around crab salad and tobiko. Its amazing. And I really think that you should do it in one bite - just do it. Report back. Don't choke. (Safety first). The Charlotte Roll and Sweet Heat Rolls are probably two of my favorites - Phoenix Maki is very good too, but available on the lunch menu. I usually get the spring rolls though, available on the lunch menu - they're really good. The nigiri list is much longer on the dinner menu too - definitely get the tuna and salmon.   I'm going to stick with my warning in the first review too - these are all very large rolls, do not over order. Order one at a time if you have to, take your time. They will charge you for wasted food. DO NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS RULE. You are warned when you sit down, Yelp has warned you, get it together. This is a glorious rule, I wish more restaurants would use it. Wasted food is not a good thing, don't do it. If you ignore all of the above warnings, then take your leftovers home and graciously pay the extra. You weren't raised in a barn.   I love this place. I will continue to come here, far more often then one actually should. Dating Tip: If you really want to test out a new date, take her here - if she says that she loves sushi and only orders one roll, she is not the one. I'm sorry, I know its a tough rule - but I feel like I'm helping you out. This place is amazing. The end."}
{"text":"My family decided to eat here last night (a Friday night, mind you) and the wait was SUPER long... an hour and a half! It was definitely too long for my fiance and I to wait, but since we were joining my family we were stuck. I do not know if they take reservations or not, I never really got the chance to ask. There is one bench inside the building (at the entrance) to sit at, but outside there are no chairs or benches at all. There is a brick lining of the building that sticks out that you can sit on, but who really wants to sit on brick for an hour? After waiting about half the time, my fiance and I decided to get a beverage. They serve wine, sake, and beer (no liquor). We never had sake so we decided to get a fruity one! I cannot remember the exact name but it was definitely white peach - and delicious!  After waiting what seemed like FOREVER, we were told our table was ready. We walked inside and the table was not ready yet... We actually saw them still cleaning the table off and rearranging the chairs. I already waited an hour and a half and now I cannot even sit when my table was \"ready\". Maybe I'm being crazy, or hangry, or maybe even both...  Once seated, we were given a piece of paper where you select which food items you would like from the AYCE. Their rule is to order as much as you can eat, because they charge for the food that you do not finish - so order a few things, and if you are still hungry you can order again. I got the miso soup, spring rolls, and a Charlotte sushi roll with a glass of water. While everyone else already received their drinks, we were still waiting for our waters... It was busy, and the dining room was packed, so it wasn't a huge deal - until we heard our server talking to another server behind us saying \"why didn't you finish the drinks?\" \"I thought you were going to finish them\"... miscommunication.   The soups and salad came rather quickly. The miso soup was pretty refreshing. It took quite a while for the appetizers (shrimp tempura and spring rolls). You get two mini spring rolls with a sweet sauce to dip in. I do not like super crispy spring rolls, so these were perfect! They were lightly fried, but still had a little crunch to them. The sushi took a while to come as well, but with the whole table basically ordering 1-2 rolls each, that makes a lot! Once the rolls came it was amazing. The Charlotte roll was very delicious, and tasted fresh. I tried one of my fiance's roll (I forget the name, but it had avocados with jalapenos on top) and it was yummy too. I thought it would be too hot for me, but the avocados kind of mask the hotness and actually make it a bit more creamy.   Overall, the price of the AYCE is good if you plan to eat a light meal for lunch! You definitely want to go here when you are starving. I suggest maybe not going on a Friday night, way too long of a wait. The service was eh, but again they were busy so I really do not know if that was accurate. The food was delicious. I will be back, but for lunch during the week. The price is a little cheaper (since it is lunch) and I do not think there were be nearly as many people waiting."}
{"text":"We went during their grand opening this past weekend. Just as expected, clean atmosphere, extremely packed (so of course the food took a bit longer than usual) nothing too ridiculous though. Will be back in the future. Still stuffed thinking about it. I was extremely impressed with the quality and the variety of sushi, appetizers, and hibachi they offered. Service was good. You could tell they were a bit inexperience, but A for effort! They tried to be as attentive as they could regardless of the crowd of customers. Really appreciated it, keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in, there was a hostess with a crop and short shorts that walked us to our table. The all-you-can eat is not worth the money, and the service was average. The miso soup I ordered had a chlorine/tap water aftertaste, and the portions were full-sized so you can only order a few items during your visit. There was nothing special about the fish nor the sushi. Do not order the BBQ squid appetizer unless you are sharing amongst many people because they give you a giant whole squid. I have been to similar places that are cheaper, do not charge as much for leftovers, and have smaller portions with better quality. I felt like I was being punished having to eat the food with my family. We were excited to try this place, but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very good service, Kelsey was very personable.  Panther and Snow White rolls were excellent.  We liked the all you can eat without being buffet."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome gem!  Sushi is fresh and flavorful.  Beer is cold and service is prompt and virtuous.  Price is excellent for the quality.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This was the weirdest Japanese I've ever been too. The food was ok and edible. However, it didn't taste like Japanese food. It was like they were trying to make authentic with subpar ingredients. Our waitress was awful. We had to ask a few times for straws and soy sauce. It was weird,  for some reason they were insisting that you use low sodium soy sauce. The buffet is not a buffet but you order these mini plates or selection of dishes. Then they charge you extra for it if you don't eat it to their standards. For $17, I'll eat it the way I want thanks.  Not a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Make sure you come here ready to eat! Talk about all you can eat! They don't play here! They have a great selection of starters, hibachi, and multiple sushi rolls to select from! One of my favorite rolls has to be the Carolina Roll, or the mango roll! So good! And best of it all you don't get to break the wallet when going to Mr. Tokyo since it's very affordable sushi eating experience."}
{"text":"Awesome selection and quality all you can eat. The dining room's a little small and the wait staff a little awkward. But overall very good for the price."}
{"text":"We have been 3 times now since they have opened. Absolutely love it! The sushi rolls are super fresh and really good! The hibachi dishes are great, as are the appetizers on the all you can eat. I would highly recommend!   Update: still love the food but the staff needs training. This has been an ongoing experience. Mr. Tokyo, when guests walk into your door you need to have a hostess that greets them timely, not wait 5 minutes and have to speak up to even be acknowledged. Also, maybe recognize regulars, we come at least once a week and every time we are still asked if we have been there before. It's not that hard to recognize a weekly customer."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house and I've been a few times since they've opened. Service is great and I love that the sushi is made to order & ingredients are always fresh. I've had the miso soup, crab Rangoon, edamame & spring rolls as appetizers. I wasn't a fan of the crab Rangoon, reminded me of a toaster strudel the filling was super hot and oozed out everywhere once you take a bit - wouldn't order again.  The sushi rolls are large, I get full off 2 or 3 but all I've had are very good! I've tried almost all of the chef rolls, have yet to try to hibachi but that's next on the list. I could see myself becoming a regular here as long as service & quality stay the same!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a combo sushi/hibachi restaurant for a birthday party group of 8. This came highly recommended. The service was very friendly, but pretty scattered. We had to ask for chopsticks, then wasabi, etc. But it was pleasantly handled and we were all in good spirits. The sushi was okay. The selection of rolls was disappointing in that, even tho there were more than I've seen at other unlimited restaurants, it seemed most were deep fried or tempura style. \"Spicy\" really wasn't. The Unagi was barely there. We all had a good time, but for the price of the unlimited, and the high recommendation, food-wise it was just okay."}
{"text":"Best value sushi you can get anywhere!  For all you can eat place the quality sushi is essentially similar to any specialized sushi place in Charlotte.  12.99 for lunch and 18.99 for dinner and weekends, you cannot beat this place.  Also all sushi and normal menu food is all you can eat and made to order instead of pre made under a heat lamp or on ice. Always fresh and hot off the wok/fryer!!   Let's just hope this place eventually does not jack up the price even higher and go down on quality and menus choices just like what most successful Asian restaurants in Charlotte likes to do...  Come try but come early since there is always a line during lunch!"}
{"text":"My staff and I come here for all you can eat sushi for lunch at least twice a month! We always do a happy dance when the food comes out, it's soooo good!"}
{"text":"All you can eat Sushi and Hibachi for a reasonable price.  OK, sounds like a good idea.  Nice location in S.CLT once you find it in the strip mall I didn't know was even there.  OK still sounds awright.  After going thrice and getting WAY above average Sushi and Hibachi along with EXCELLENT service every time.  My only ask is to keep the price and quality food/service the same.  You could get charged more and I would still give Mister 3 or 4 stars.  Stay the course and you will stay 5-stars and I just hope you do..."}
{"text":"I have been here many times. The all you can eat is wonderful! The food is so good. The Miami Roll is my absolute favorite. Unfortunately, they need a better waiting system. They write down names and just mark off random ones as they go. They say it's a 30 minute wait, but 30 turned into an hour. There's not much space there to wait either."}
{"text":"This is probably the best value Japanese restaurant in town, and the line is pretty long on peak time. My favorite roll is Mr. Tokyo roll and their yellowtail jalapeño!! Signature Tokyo bowl for my appetizer too. My server is nice, and the food comes out fresh and good! I tried a little of everything, and I'm a satisfy and happy customer! Highly recommend friend to try this one! I can order more rolls to try if I bring more friends, and I'm getting more value than the price I paid."}
{"text":"One of my favorite all you can eat Sushi places in Charlotte. I recommend trying the Phoenix Maki Roll & the Red Dragon Roll if nothing else.   Friendly servers and fast service. Easy to find parking out front & you can't miss the big Red MR. TOKYO sign."}
{"text":"This was my third visit and has become a solid favorite. The menu is extensive with many familiar items and many new things to try. Everything is listed with an explanation of ingredients, so it's easy to find what you'll like. The service is cheerful and attentive. All the staff seems busy, hard-working and happy to help.  As for the food itself: delicious, plentiful, and beautifully presented. You can go for a casual lunch or take someone you want to impress. A definite five stars!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Charlotte they have amazing sushi and all you can eat has super low price!!! Recommend"}
{"text":"Went to try during lunch. Everyone was very friendly and service was very attentive. Décor was nice. Tried the all you can eat option. Ordered Seaweed Salad, vegetable tempura, rainbow roll, 2 Tuna Sushi, spicy tuna and Crazy roll. I was most impressed with the tuna Sushi because it was not a thin slice of tuna on top of sushi rice. It was a nice thick piece. The vegetable tempura was great. Nice and hot and very crispy. Seaweed salad was delicious and was on top of a bed of julienned cucumbers. The other rolls were just a delicious but one item I didn't get was the Spicy tuna roll but instead got a California roll. That didn't bother me as much. For the price, it was well worth the food and service received. I would highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"My first experience of Mr. Tokyo was five star for sure. I went on a Friday night with my boyfriend arriving around 8 o'clock. There was a 50 minute wait and we ended up sitting at the sushi bar sooner than 50 minutes. We had: 2 octopus nigirl 3 eel nigirl Rainbow roll Snow white roll Deep blue roll Pepper tuna roll Spicy girl roll Sweet heat roll And last but not least hibachi beef I can't believe we ate the whole thing !!! But we did.....and at $19/person this was a crazy great value. Our favorite was the eel nigiri and the pepper tuna roll. Least favorite was the octopus nigiri. It wasn't bad, just not our favorite. Once we sat down and ordered our sushi it arrived very quickly. Honestly I liked everything about this experience. Can't wait to go back. The value was amazing. I have paid a lot more for lesser quality tasting sushi. Five stars from me."}
{"text":"The food was just ok since I arrived famished. For people with little sushi experience, unaware of flavors and textures unique to each fish, it's a bargain.   If you are looking for quantity to fill your stomach and not the experience of quality food, you will do well. Its not just the size of the sushi pieces that was disappointing, it was the tasteless mushy, consistent with low grade, old or frozen (too long) fish. Everything tastes the same, moosh requiring soy sauce to add flavor.  The tempura shrimp was a frozen breaded shrimp or breaded mystery fish coated with overdone crusty breading (no flavor), gyoza dumplings were right out of the bag and into the fryer (signs of freezer burn) , agedashi tofu was gummy, sauces were watered down and tasteless, even the wasabi. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying I have always been a loyal customer to this restaurant and have never had bad service until last night. I had decided to meet some people there for dinner and was told there would be a 30 minute wait...not a problem. When we got seated our server greeted us and took our drink orders. When he brought our drink orders he collected the paper menus we filled out. 10 minutes later my appetizer comes to the table....cold. When we finished our first round of sushi the sever collected the plates however never asked if we wanted additional menus to fill out. We had to ask three times before we finally got more menus. Then my drink was empty, our server approached the table to ask if everything was ok but never insisted to fill up my cup. Our food was very slow to come out every time we ordered. When the bill came I didn't tip for the lousy service, after my party and I got up to leave the server followed us around the wall and told us to never come back...( I'm assuming for not tipping). Ok no problem I won't ever come back, and I hope you know you lost three very loyal customers tonight because of your servers actions."}
{"text":"We did the eat unlimited sushi for dinner. Not disappointed in any roll of sushi one bit. Everything was fresh and tasted beyond perfection. The fried rice and appetizers were also all perfectly executed. For unlimited sushi this place was amazing! It's small inside so I would get there earlier but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came for the dinner AYCE sushi. The quality of fish was good and the amount of rolls that they offer was a great variety. The other items (appetizers, Mr. Tokyo bowl) was great."}
{"text":"Ok.... I went back. I didn't try the older rolls that I tried on my previous visit, but I tried some new ones I live the tempura they used on their rolls. It's not super thick and gives the perfect texture to the rolls. The Las Vegas roll is delish.   RU Sans offers an all u can eat lunch, but their rolls are small and tiny. The rolls at Mr. Tokyo are huge!!! Worth the money, the ambiance is awesome, the service is great.  And the sashimi...OMG! The THICKEST and freshest sashimi ever. The sashimi dies cost .50 cents each... but you will not regret it. Blown me away. Service is excellent, as before. Try the Coconut sake, it's a cold sake, but it's good. It's the first time I've ever had cold sake. And such a pretty bottle!   Bravo! One of my fave places to eat at. And the only place I would eat sushi at."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to fall in love with this place!  We trekked 30 minutes to get here- with a 4 month old- so my husband could indulge on sushi.  Usually his appetite would mean a $100 sushi bill- and we are trying to ball on a budget with a new baby.  We were sat right away in the perfect location- the corner- away from the hoopla of a busy restaurant.  The server came right away, and we put in our drink orders.  There is a strip of booths and a ton of tables in the middle of the room.  It's tight in there, and it's not a large place.  We soon after put in our appetizer and sushi order.  Then we waited.....and waited.....and waited.  One of our appetizers was seaweed salad.  That was not brought out until I asked for it.  It took over 30 minutes to get out sushi.  Pretty sure it was closer to 45.  We were both getting very impatient- and the server never even apologized until the food actually came out.  The stars are because the sushi was good.  The 3 missing is because my hanger was real that night.  Once we got the sushi, we liked it- but it was such a slow and bad experience, I'm not sure we will be back.  Lunch price is $10.95, dinner $17.95 just FYI."}
{"text":"OH YES.... to all you can eat sushi and hibachi!!!  I have a husband who's a bottomless pit with sushi- and we used to venture out to Pineville to hit up the other location occasionally- but this location is SO much closer.  And SO much nicer too in my opinion!  It also has a patio and a smaller private room.  Something different!  You can order off the menu but I recommend the all you can eat option.  Just make sure you eat all the sushi because they do charge for each piece you don't finish!  Take your time, enjoy it and order as you go!  Everything is made to order and super fresh.  You can't go wrong if you like sushi.  Lunch is a good price at 13.99.  Dinner puts you in the closer to $20 range, but if you are in the mood to throw down, it would be worth it!"}
{"text":"The bad: The nickel-and-diming has to stop! From the moment you walk in they immediately start telling you about how they upcharge for every little thing. Want Sashimi? $.50 per piece! Don't like something or can't finish it? $1.00 per roll! Their massive rolls average 8 big pieces per roll, which makes it very hard to do any real sampling unless you're just absolutely pigging out or with a large group.  The good: The rolls are pretty creative and quite tasty. The sushi is the quality that you'd expect at this type of restaurant: not great but pretty good. It's nice that they have some appetizers and cooked items as part of the AYCE menu.  Overall not sure if I'll go back or not. A good coupon would probably be enough to sway me."}
{"text":"Great lunch special! I got miso soup, a rainbow roll, and three salmon nigiri for just 12.99. And the food was delicious! The service was also attentive and timely."}
{"text":"Food was ABSOLUTELY FANOMINAL!!! It was so worth the price. Well cooked, great portion sizes! Only downer-THERE WAS NO HEAT IN THE PLACE. We froze sitting there!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  You get all-you-can eat SPECIALTY sushi rolls and appetizers and hibachi for $19 (dinner).  Impossible to beat. The food is great and the service is prompt.  The restaurant gets very crowded so expect a wait on weekends."}
{"text":"I came with the high expectations after visiting the original location and this location of Mr Tokyo did not disappoint. The new location is larger and has a patio for the summer. You can't complain with unlimited appetizers, hibachi and sushi.  The food is fresh, tasteful and comes out quickly."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, with a clean, classy, relaxed atmosphere!  Grabbed a seat at the bar for the all-you-can-eat lunch special, (amazingly priced! $11.99 for an adult meal!) and the food was tremendous!  The service was a bit slow, though it was lunch time, so I'm inclined to let it slide for the most part.  Definitely will be back if I find myself in town again."}
{"text":"I was visiting my cousins in Charlotte and they mentioned this place. I love the concept of all you can eat sushi that are made to order. We went for lunch, so it was a bang for your money. I believe they are still very new, so the prices are really cheap, so try before they hike up their prices!!"}
{"text":"When it first opened it was one of the best places in CLT to have sushi. Their selection is remarkable-great combinations. But they are slipping in cleanliness. I sat at the bar and one of the chefs was sniffling over the roll he was preparing, then a waiter dropped a tempura veggie from the plate to the tray that I assure you it was not clean. With chopsticks she put it back on the plate and off to the guest... the american girl at the register saw all this and though she was clearly disgusted, she didn't do a thing to stop the waiter and change the order. Then the cheffs throw the ticket into the plate and it gets soaked, ink and paper touching the food. The waiters have to take it away with their fingers...not good. I used to love this place but they need to tighten up the hygiene. No lie."}
{"text":"My first thought when I heard about AYCE Sushi was those standard buffets, or even worse, the sushi train where you are not sure how long the sushi has been sitting out for in the restaurant....I was wrong!   With the AYCE sushi deal ($17.99 for dinner) you are able to indicate via paper and pencil which rolls, appetizers, nigiri, or even non-sushi dishes you want, as many times as you want. With their rolls being $12, it's a great deal! My boyfriend is not a sushi fan and there is plenty of variety with noodle bowls, appetizers, teriyaki, and hibachi (also all you can eat.)  The service is great- quick and friendly. They do a good job of checking in with you along the way to see if you want to order any additional food.  The food was very high quality as well, which is something that you don't often get at a AYCE or buffet place. I had the Miso Soup, Avocado Salad (the only thing that was slightly underwhelming), Yellowtail Appetizer, Salmon and Tuna Nigiri, and then split 6 rolls with a friend. My favorite roll was the Sweet Heat, but you really can't go wrong with any of the options.  This is my vote for the best sushi in Charlotte at the best value!"}
{"text":"My sister & I come in atleast once a week, we feel super lucky to have such a great spot so close by. The food is always great and the staff is very friendly.  This a fairly new location and it seems like they are still finding their footing with staff, etc. I visited the Pineville location and had incredible service and have no doubt that after a few more months this location will be 5 stars too."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars!  Mr Tokyo is a Japanese restaurant located in Charlotte, NC.  I was there for a business trip, and my boss / manager picked this place to eat for dinner after we got off the plane.  They are known for their AYCE (All You Can Eat) / unlimited Sushi & Hibachi ($18.99 per person for adults).  Be careful as they do charge for leftovers!!    I rated it 3.5 stars because it's not exactly authentic, but for the $18.99 AYCE price, it's really worth the value and the quality of the fish.  I came with my boss and another colleague - all of us agreed that their salmon was really fresh (at the time).  Good variety and selection for the price.    ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"This is by far, my favorite sushi join in Charlotte. It offers a great all-you-can-eat lunch/dinner come ($12 and $18) with classic rolls, specialty rolls, sashimi, hibachi, etc. I love the variety that comes with it and it's an easy place to accommodate all needs. If you're doing lunch - get there before 12 or expect a bit of a wait. Dinner is typically free flowing. The staff is very friendly and not too over bearing which I love. If you like sushi - you must try."}
{"text":"The sushi is great, but beware of the all you can eat.....go a couple rolls at a time.....lol"}
{"text":"I think this place is great and a really good option for people who are new to Japanese cuisine and sushi, along with those that are familiar. They have unlimited sushi and hibachi options which is something that you don't see too often(besides on those disgusting buffets) so to have a Mr. Tokyo offer that is awesome. This is a really good place to try some sushi rolls that you may not have tried otherwise and the price is reasonable. The restaurant is on the smaller side and was clean when I visited. The staff was fine as well. The quality of the dishes are good. I'll be going back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I never ever give 5 stars but this place deserves it and I'm mad that I haven't been coming here for years.  It's a all you can sushi and hibachi kind of place but not a buffet.  They also have soups, appetizers etc you order they will make it fresh.  The sushi was amazing and so many different rolls and the hibachi chicken is awesome.  The steam was overcooked but everything else was amazing. This will be our new place to go for sushi and hibachi.   You must go here, there will he a wait at night and also they are open for lunch."}
{"text":"The best first experience at Mr. Tokyo tonight. We had to try them during opening week. There was a small wait, but the staff was moving quickly and efficiently to serve everyone. Once we were seated, everything flowed smoothly.  WE LOVE SUSHI, and the All You Can Eat style menu was AMAZING. For about $20 each from 3:30-9:30 M-F and all day Sat and Sun you can take advantage of this awesome deal. Note, there is an up charge of $0.50 per piece of sashimi, so get the nigiri and call it a night!  Seriously, Mr. Tokyo is the best. The clear soup is hearty and my favorite way to start. Then it's protein, protein, protein with the fresh cuts of fish. LOVE that you're in the Prosperity Village neighborhood. Keep it coming!"}
{"text":"I can say that for the price, this is an excellent sushi restaurant. Sushi is good and tasty. The waiter was very nice. The manager is good too. Other than you have to wait for while to get a table here, this is a very good restaurant for people that love sushi."}
{"text":"We had no idea going in about the all you can eat/ pay for what you waste concept. It took us about 10 minutes of questions with the excellent waitress to understand which parts of the menu were included in the all you can eat and how many pieces of sushi came with each roll- the rolls they cut come with 6-8 but the hand rolls and nigiri you just order how many you want. This is the best quality sushi we've ever eaten, but we both HATED the crunchy roll, a hand roll of seaweed and something crunchy and dry and something fishy in skinny squiggles- we ordered two pieces and they were giant and it was hard to make it through them but worth it not to pay extra! We added up what we ordered would have cost us and came out about $5 on top. This experience is definitely not for people new to sushi because you might order several things you don't like and end up in trouble. But we had a great time and can't wait to go back, next time with bigger appetites!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Took my dad here for Father's day and we really enjoyed it.  It's a new concept (to me atleast), all you can eat Japanese food including sushi!  Now, incase you are wondering no it is not a buffet.  This is really all you can eat.  Apps, salads, entrees, and sushi.  And the quality was excellent.   They give nice size portions and great quality of food.  Weekend dinner price is $16.99 a person...you can't beat that deal!  Service was pretty good, especially being a holiday.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect from an all you can eat Sushi place.  Was very surprised to find that all the rolls came out fast and fresh.  No pre rolled cold Sushi rolls.  The place was busy and the service was fast and top notch.  I would recommend eating here for a Sushi fix for sure.  Didn't try anything off the Hibachi, but I am sure by the quality of the Sushi that I would have been happy with that also."}
{"text":"Wonderful first time experience. Mr. Tokyo is a very clean and friendly environment. The sushi is freshly made and is very tasty. The hibachi chicken is phenomenal, all of the food has tons of flavor and makes you want more. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food is good and tasty! Great variety of choices. My wife and and had hibachi with beef and shrimp and it was cooked well. We could easily chew it. It was great! We also had three different type of sushi rolls and my favorite was the Mr. Tokio one, which was full of flavor.   I want to go back to try other specialty sushis. What I don't think I've ever seen before is that they will charge you for every piece of roll you don't eat, so it's better to start with something small and after you finish you can order more. This is the only reason I give it four stars.  We'll come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Man, sometimes I wish I wasn't pregnant so I can order anything on this all you can eat menu! I've ordered most of the cooked sushi that were listed and it was so good. Everything tasted fresh so I'm sure if I were to order raw fish they would be also.  Nice selections of appetizers so be careful when ordering bec they really fill you up fast.   Definitely my go to (ayce) sushi place!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, great price. Not a lot of sushi buffet can match the quality here. Friendly staff. Though accommodations can be lacking at times"}
{"text":"New restaurant just open. Fresh, Clean, and Friendly staffs!! Great place to hangout and enjoy sushi!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Benfield. They just open not too long ago, and I was here with my wife for her birthday. The sushi plate is like artist with sauce on top of it. The rice is cook perfectly, not too hard or soft. They have the best sushi in town for $18.99 per person. Omg, it's a steal and deal!! We only waited in at the entrance and the food come out quick once we are seated. The host is friendly and our server is very nice. I would highly recommend my friends to come try this restaurant. Dine in quality for bundle price deal. It's like Black Friday restaurant deal every day!"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous! All foods were delicious! Service was very cordial and prompt.  It was the  BEST Japanese food I have ever eaten! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone! I never really liked sushi till I tried it here.  I am now a true sushi lover!"}
{"text":"I didn't have high hopes for the place  when I heard there was another Japanese restaurant opening.  I thought it would be just another generic, casual, sushi place. I was not a fan of Tanakas, their tastes were never consistent. Anywho, I loved Mr. Tokyo.  When I hear \"all you can eat\" I automatically think of low quality food,  and nasty buffets.... but Mr. Tokyo was not like that at all. It's all you can eat but made to order. They also have an a la carte menu. I went for lunch.  For roughly $12 it was a bargain.    As far as food, it's not the best sushi in the  world but it's damn good for the value! Everything was delicious.  Aside from sushi, my  sister got a teriyaki dish and even commented on how great it tasted.  Overall, the service was good,  food was great,  and the ambience was good....the interior is very easy on the eyes!"}
{"text":"4-months old & do'in a nice business. Clean, friendly & prompt service coupled w/great food. The All-you-can-eat covers the whole menu, tempura, udon and most importantly, sushi! Ala Carte is available if you bring along a whossy..."}
{"text":"$16.99 gets you all you can eat on the dinner menu, with a few caveats.  Let's put this into perspective: nowadays, what can you REALLY get for $16.99?  You can't get 2 rolls at a regular sushi joint; you can't get 2 small plates at a tapas restaurant; you can get 1 pizza but not an appetizer -- let's be real; $16.99 doesn't get you much, rarely the opportunity to gorge yourself to the brink of calling a state of digestive emergency.  Mr. Tokyo gets 4.5 stars -- rounding up to 5 for: (1) good service; (2) good food; and (3) superb value.    THE CAVEATS: 1)  If you want sashimi, there's a $.50/piece upcharge -- reasonable since you're getting twice the sushi with half the ability to fill up because you're not consuming any carbs or fillers 2)  No waste policy.  If you have 4+ pieces leftover (that's half a roll), then you will be charged for the roll but you can take it home with you  Location and ambience. It's located in a strip mall and the restaurant is relatively small, which explains the wait time.  The decor tries to be modern with backlighting but otherwise nothing remarkable and is your typical Japanese or sushi restaurant.    Good service. We came around 3 pm on a Saturday afternoon and were seated right away (the restaurant was 25% full).  Our server was extremely attentive and prompt, gave us the rundown on the restaurant rules, and seamlessly served or cleared away everything we needed and didn't need, respectively.   Good food.  All things considered, the food here is solid, especially given that you're meant to eat in bulk -- the Costco of sushi dining, so to speak.  You're not going to get Toro or any other premium grade sushi because that's not what you're paying for; if that's what you're seeking, be prepared to shell out 3 or 4 times more for your meal (if this is your expectation, then I'm calling you out for being one of those whiners who expects champagne on a beer budget).  There are quite a few AYCE sushi joints in S Cal with this exact premise; Mr. Tokyo is right on par with the 4.5-star S Cal counterparts.    TIP: you can ask for substitutions or modifications to your order so you get exactly what you want.  For example, I only wanted the sweet potato in the vegetable tempura and that's exactly what they brought me.  I've had: +++  miso soup.  The broth is a perfect blend of the miso stuff and tofu; I've been to places where it's super watered down before +++  squid salad.  The squid salad is superb (ask for lemon to squeeze over it for a little tangy kick; this is how it's usually served at other sushi restaurants) and usually is $9 just for the salad +++  yellowtail.  We've had yellowtail all over Charlotte: BLT Steakhouse, Baku, Cowfish, and Hibiscus and the yellowtail here is better than Cowfish and Hibiscus (you're limited to one order per customer) +++  shrimp tempura.  Crispy and the ponzu sauce is great (sweet with just a little tangy lemon kick); my BF liked it with the spicy mayo.  +++  sweet potato tempura.  A teeny bit on the greasy side but it's tempura, after all.  Clearly wasn't way too greasy because I asked for two orders. +++  ika (squid) sushi.  The freshness, consistency and sweetness of the squid is great; I had 4 orders (you order them 1 piece at a time).  I added masago to my second order. +++  philly roll.  I like the cream cheese and usually order this sans avocado.  Next time, I'll stick with the Panther roll because it tastes better and has the cream cheese in it +++ Panther roll.  Delicious.  It has shrimp tempura, cream cheese, crab, jalapeño and sriracha.  It was splendid.    Room for improvement.  They will only make you a full roll so you really have to commit to 7-10 pieces; I'd prefer to have the flexibility to try more items and order half rolls but I get it, it's more work for them.  Value.  First and foremost, for eating at an establishment that serves bulk raw fish, it passes the digestive test (after your meal, are you counting the minutes until you get home and taking an inventory of the number of people in your car vs the number of bathrooms you have?; would this be a safe first date venue? -- the epitome of diner's remorse).  Second, the overall dining experience was commensurate to the price; in fact, given there are few places where you can stuff your face and still get pretty good quality food, it feels like a steal (the table adjacent to us served two people 4 sushi rolls each; they were in it to win it!).  When it comes to consuming raw fish, especially considering that you know that you're not being served premium grade sushi, you have to be cognizant that you're taking a calculated digestive risk; there's a delicate balance between quality vs. quantity.  However, the risk here is small, the food is solid, and the value is tremendous.  Kudos to Mr. Tokyo for finding that equilibrium and delivering on a great dining experience that is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Eating here now. Found a hair wrapped in my sushi roll. They didn't seem to care. So disgusting!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 6 times and it's awesome every time.  The restaurant is a little tight, and there's usually a wait but that's the only negative thing that I can say.  The staff is friendly and the food is high quality, fresh and delicious. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been twice and I genuinely can't come up with a single negative thing to say about Mr. Tokyo. I mean, other than I have to drive to Pineville.   The fish is fresh, the rolls are flavorful, and the service is on point. For an All You Can Eat place, I wouldn't expect the food to be great, but it really is.   TIP: The Mr. Tokyo Bowl is an appetizer limited to one per person. Get one for every person in your party and filch from your friends. It's excellent."}
{"text":"If you are a sushi fan then this place is the place for you. Pretty much all the reviews sum up about this place. I took my parents there during lunch and we were very impressed especially you can order the specialty rolls from the menu. Usually the all you can eat sushi place there is a limit on what you can order from the menu. We went during lunch and the staff was very attentive. We ordered the Miami roll and it was so good. Its ice cream was also very good. I hope they keep up with its quality and continues to do well."}
{"text":"All you could eat but made to order delicious! Downfall is the sashimi being charged extra per piece but all and all very great sushi selection. Jalapeño yellowtail very worth the all you could eat!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS hand made food! We got the all you can eat lunch. And we were very satisfied! Everything was fresh. And the waitress was mindful of my husband's food allergies."}
{"text":"pretty good for all you can eat sushi but as a big sushi fan it's not anything worth going out of your way for. that being said, i haven't tried their full menu (but i don't think i ever would with the unlimited menu)"}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent. Don't let the strip mall location dissuade you. The three of us ordered the usual starters, some tempura, and 6 different sushi rolls. It was all excellent with the exception of the Crazy California roll. It was coated in tempura and fried. We weren't expecting that."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi in Charlotte! I love all their different shrimp rolls and the bbq squid is an amazing must have."}
{"text":"Came in last week, service is better, food brought out exactly as I ordered this time (it was all-you-can-eat sushi btw every time I came). Will update more if they keep doing good jobs."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, but the last two times I have gone.. we have had issues with being skipped on a wait of 30-45 minutes.. First time it was with a party of 4.. We didn't mind the bar seating ( wasn't even offered as an option) When I mentioned it to the guy, he wasn't very happy sitting us up there.. even though he was about to sit another party of 4 at the bar.. and I had to speak up and let them know we were their prior to the other party. The other occasion ( last night) we had 3 toddlers.. we waited 40 minutes.. and they sat another party of 6 before us.. We seen the other party check in after us.. and when we spoke up. They lied in our face and said that the other party was here prior to us.. Even though we told them that we seen them come in and check in AFTER US.. The manager was rude. Didn't care for what we had to say.. or the fact that we had 3 toddlers with us waiting to eat. Make sure you keep an close eye when having to wait.. you will be skipped and they can care less about it."}
{"text":"I only gave four stars because I'm not a sushi lover. Went here because my family is. Service is good and we were seated fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Mr. Tokyo has a decent selection of items for the all-you-can-eat, and most of their fish is very fresh and delicious.  I like that you can do AYCE at lunch or dinner and the price is particularly reasonable for dinner time.  One of the few downsides is that their specialty rolls have something fried and covered in a lot of sauce, so  it's hard to find some that are not overly rich.  However, they have a decent variety of items you can order and some items for people who are not a fan of sushi.  I've never tried the hibachi because I am always in the mood for sushi, so I can't speak to those items.  As for sushi, their fish is generally fresh and tasty.  Their salmon, in particular, has always been spot-on when we've been there in terms of freshness and flavor.  I always order multiple pieces of nigiri with salmon.  The BBQ eel nigiri is tasty as well, with tender eel that is not chewy and a balanced sauce.  The mackeral, escolar, and yellowtail are always good as well.    The classic rolls are well done and tasty, but some of the specialty rolls are a little disappointing.  Most of them are covered in a lot of sauce.  A lot of them are deep fried, contain tempura items, or have added crunch to them, which is a little disappointing if you are looking for something a little lighter.  The Philadelphia Roll is a personal favorite, as is the Rainbow Roll.    In addition to nigiri and rolls, they have appetizers, soup, salad, and hibachi.  It's nice to have a little something for everyone, and for $18.99 for dinner you can get a great variety of food.  Sashimi is not included in the AYCE, but you can order pieces of sashimi for $.50 each piece and they are quite large pieces if you decide to add some.  All of the dishes are made to order and come out in a pretty reasonable time.  Some items take longer than others, so if you order several things they will bring them out as they finish (although they usually bring rolls out together, nigiri out together, and then cooked items as they finish).  Service is generally pretty good here and the place is almost always packed.  Make sure you don't order more than you can eat, as there is a charge if you don't finish.    Overall, there is a lot of love about My. Toyko because the food is good, the AYCE price is reasonable, and the service is good."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy going to Mr Tokyo's but this time was very unpleasant. The staff was rude, unorganized and service was slower then ever. Shouldn't take food almost 45 min to come out of a kitchen. Already had my bill and paid then my food comes out..... The rude hostess had the nerve to say that I owed another 6 for the food.... I don't thank so! Sorry MR. Tokyo you lost a few good customers today. The sad part is is we come to the Pineville location very frequently."}
{"text":"Sushi is great, price is good, you definitely get what your pay for, only reason I give it a 4 and not a 5 is because of the hostess. My family and I are regulars and til this day she doesn't smile or greet us like normal places would, very rude as well, always has an attitude if we ask certain question or if we show up 45 minutes before lunch ends. She's the only thing I would change about this place."}
{"text":"I've heard great things a decided to try. I went with a simple 3 course meal. I started with the spring rolls. Fried perfectly not greasy at all. They are very small so mindful. I tried the Angel Hair roll which is 8 pieces. Great roll the crab on top makes this roll. I finished the meal with the fried ice cream! No complaints here just great!!! So to anybody living the area we finally have a go to sushi spot. The staff and service great! They definitely have a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I had the all you can eat sushi there and it was actually a lot more fresh than I expected. Great variety of selections and the everything is very clean as it's just opened. Happy to be a regular."}
{"text":"Another delicious find in an unlikely place. This spot is tucked in a strip mall next to a hungry howies & an alterations place. But don't be fooled! Everything about this place is amazing!  The service was friendly & fast. The restaurant was clean..... which is a must when we're talking sushi! The price was very reasonable. $12.99 for all you can eat sushi & hibachi is where it's at!  Everything was super fresh with great flavor. A nice wide variety on the roll options too. They didnt skimp on the amount for the price. We will frequent here a lot now that we found it!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find the best sushi place but THIS is the BEST sushi place!! My boyfriend and I went there 3 times already. We always appreciate the waiters there. Very friendly and brought our food quickly. This is always our first sushi on the go place!"}
{"text":"This is a nice and popular place to get sushi.  The food is good and the servers are great."}
{"text":"I've never been to an AYCE spot that includes the entire menu. Mr. Tokyo has an extensive menu of appetizers, soups, salads, entrees and sushi and it's ALL included in the price. On Saturday and Sunday, they run their dinner menu all day -- $16.99 AYCE. Their weekday lunch is a little cheaper ($10.99, I think) but a more limited menu.   We tried the seaweed salad, gyoza, spring rolls, shrimp tempura, chicken fried rice and 4 specialty rolls. We would have spent well over $40 just on the rolls alone anywhere else. Such a great deal! And, everything we tried was very good. My favorite, hands down, was the Charlotte roll. Next time we visit, my order will be 5 Charlotte rolls pleaseandthankyou. ;)   We arrived at 11:30am on a Saturday and the place was almost empty. While we ate, tables quickly filled up though. So, you might hit a short wait if you arrive in the prime lunch hour, between noon and 1pm. Service was friendly and attentive. All the food came out pretty quickly! We ordered in stages so as not to waste -- they do charge for excessive waste (we didn't get hit with anything because we cleared our plates) but are very upfront and honest about it. If you get an up charge, it's really no one's fault but your own."}
{"text":"BBQ squid is always on point! Service is good and consistent everytime! Get the chicken nuggets! Crispy!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to visit Mr. Tokyo! Talk about Pure Excellence! Everything is fresh, made to order. The Best Sushi In Charlotte!!! If sushi isn't your thing, there are other options available. Why go anywhere else, when you can have AYCE sushi and hibachi for $18.99 (dinner price)! The only downside is not taking home the leftovers. Otherwise, you'd be insane to pass up this deal! Each roll is packed with high-quality ingredients. I've eaten here twice for dinner within the past two weeks--with no wait time during each visit. Not. sure what the lunch crowd is like.   I'm highly impressed with the size and quality of the Chef Special Rolls! You should definitely come hungry, and wear your stretch pants. My first visit, I walked out waddling!  I prefer the specialty rolls because I'm obsessed with the plating!!! Definitely, picture worthy!   Here are my personal favorites! I would highly recommend ordering these:  I've ordered the Mr. Tokyo & Snow White Roll twice already. So what does that tell you? Hahaha!   Dragon & White Dragon Roll  Lobster Salad Roll - This will open your sinus's for sure. I've never had a lobster salad but this was pretty amazing.   I'll be coming back for my third visit this week. I plan to enjoy hibachi this time."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service in a very cool, modern environment. Very pleased with the experience and will absolutely be back. After dinner my boyfriend & I agreed that this is our new favorite sushi joint, hands down!"}
{"text":"All you can Eat Menu is $18. So better be HUNGRY. If you don't like the roll you ordered after the first bite. Let your server know so they won't charge you for not finishing it. We ordered 1 roll at a time yo make sure not to waste any. I only got through 2 rolls & 2 appetizers.  The spring rolls were delicious- BUT very little filling. It's mostly wrapper Gyoza - although the were delicious it was VERY oily/greasy Panther roll is SPICY. Oh my !! Come with several hungry people & everyone order something different & share, because the rolls are cut 8-9 pieces. This way you get to try more items before you're full!  You can order off regular menu- but no sharing of the AYCE items others get.  Would love to come back & try more items."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been very popular since recently opening due to the fabulous all you can eat, made-to-order sushi. You won't find another sushi restaurant in South Charlotte on par with Mr Tokyo and that can beat its pricing and quality. We have revisited this restaurant numerous times and have yet to be displeased. Some might call us addicted"}
{"text":"When I hear all u can eat , I automatically think of low quality food , and nasty buffets....but mr Tokyo was not like that at all. The food good for the value! Everything's delicious,I will be back"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Our favorite rolls are Carolina Roll, Phoenix Roll, Hot Sweet Roll. Nigiri & Sashimi are fresh and cut plenty thick. Goyza was really good and flavorful as was the spring rolls. We will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Mr. Tokyo... I have been hearing good things!  Usually when I hear \"all you can eat sushi\" I sort of cringe and remember bad experiences of buffet style sushi that is not very good and really just betting on volume more than quality.  So this place is actually LEGIT.... they ask you to finish your orders before ordering more (so no wasting is allowed... neither is sharing).  Everything is made to order.  As soon as you walk in, you see the army of sushi chefs behind the counter furiously filling orders.  Note:  They won't seat you until your entire party is present.  There was six of us and there were plenty of seats (large tables available).  I thought it was a little awkward to wait, but I get the policy.  I'm usually the person that gets to the place first and sits at the table while everyone else trickles in.  There is a very tiny waiting area.... our entire party of six filled up the one bench they had in front of the hostess stand.  Once we got seated the magical paper menu appeared and we were given a quick run-through on how everything works.  Our server, Nick, was super nice and he was always back checking with us if we wanted to order more and take away our plates.  I'm definitely a fan.  Their specialty rolls were very tasty and beautiful to look at... and their standard fare is great as well.  I usually judge a place by their spicy tuna roll... and it is excellent here.    So this place is tucked away in a shopping center.  Maybe it's because I went to high school just down the road, but it does feel weird making the trip to Pineville and seeing this same shopping center, but with just different business tenants.  At one point there was a Dairy Queen where I used to hang out here.... but it's long gone.  If you aren't a fan of driving...con your friend into carpooling and enjoying some sushi."}
{"text":"I dont know if i would say this place deserves a 5 stars, afterall, it is sushi buffet. But definitely 4.5 stars foe charlotte standard! Keep ip the good work mr. Tokyo. You walk in, it isnt very bug, but the restaurant is clean. Service is pretty fast and the music isn't annoyingly loud. The only thing i dont like is the miso soup tastes like tap water. The fish is very fresh, if you get nigiri, expect the rice portion to be larger than typical nigiri. Waitress was well mannered and not rude. Inwas surprised she actually knew the menu pretty well. Only 1 bathroom stall per gender."}
{"text":"Cant beat the unlimited menu.  Unlimited sushi and appetizers.  They also have a Tepanyaki style menu."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi sounds like a dream come true! Mr. Tokyo has $17 Saturday, Sunday, and weeknight dinner. Lunch is $12, which I thought was included in weekends, but it is not.    Pros: AYCE sushi includes specialty rolls, appetizers, hibachi, kids menu, and classic/hand rolls. They have the most options I've ever seen for AYCE. The quality of the food was great too! Service was friendly and helpful.   Cons: The poor waitress seemed to be working all the tables by herself, but she did a great job at keeping up. The sanitation score is 92, which is pretty low for my standards, but I enjoyed the food regardless.   I will definitely be taking the 30 minute drive to return! Just be sure not to order more than you can eat, or you will hate yourself for shoving sushi down your throat to avoid additional charges."}
{"text":"Hands down to the best restaurant in Charlotte. This place is a heaven for authentic Japanese hibachi and sushi lovers. They also charge you for wasted food. So pick as you can eat. People are friendly, fresh food in the town.  Also plan ahead, the average waiting time is 3o minutes to find a sitting place."}
{"text":"Hands down, best sushi buffet I've ever been too. Amazing selection for an excellent price. This is our go-to spot every Friday for lunch. They have a more limited selection of sushi for the dinner buffet, which is strange because you pay more for dinner. So we just make sure to get there for lunch, so we can get our favorite rolls! Angel hair and the Miami roll are our favorites. But they also have delicious spring rolls and teriyaki chicken so there is a good selection for the whole family! Service is mostly good but you have to ask for your check, otherwise they won't give it to you. We recently waited 40 minutes after eating for our check, we found out our waiter had gone to break and didn't have anyone cover him. I won't take a point off because their food is so delicious and worth the wait! ButWill definitely continue to come back!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new location. Wait time: usually instant before 6 or 630. When it is too busy, it may take a while just to get seated but the turn over per table is pretty good so max of wait is like... I would say 40 mins. Good friendly staff. Food is what you can expect from a okay/good AYCE sushi place. Miso soup is a must. That sounds odd but they do it right. If they do one thing right, they must do other things right, right?"}
{"text":"First time visit, and we were impressed with the food quality, as many have said. Our young Asian server couldn't have been more sweet and informative. The crab salad was good, crab  Rangoon's nicely filled and crunchy.  Spring rolls hot and crisp.  Soups average, and the sushi really good and flavorful.  Only down side was... no noodles at lunch and the meats said no veggies. I don't know if I could get hibachi veggies or not?  Seems strange that they don't offer that."}
{"text":"My family's go to spot when we are craving sushi because it's all you can eat. We go at least once a month (because we eat till we are sick). Definitely go with a crowd when you can so you can try everything! There is so much to choose from like appetizers, hibachi, sushi, and much more. We love their hand rolls. Their crab salad is literally imitation crab and cucumber so make sure to ask for spicy mayo to go along with it. Their clear soup tastes awful and my house salad seemed like it's been sitting in the fridge for awhile because the lettuce was wilted. For the price you pay I think it's well worth it! Why spend 12-14 on sushi or hibachi when you can spend 18 and almost have it all."}
{"text":"Best value, service and quality in the South Charlotte Area!  The food here is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is a decent value but I always leave underwhelmed.  You can get a lot of decent food but you won't get much great food.  This place can also get really slow.  I cant put my finger on it but many of the roles seem more bland or off the mark, not so much as to be bad, but enough so that I never crave the items here.  I think you can have a good time here but they haben't cracked the code to rising above modest expectations."}
{"text":"We loved the hidden treasure and will def be back! All you can eat is a super deal! Delicious and service was great too!!"}
{"text":"Great find in the North Charlotte area, with all you can eat sushi and hibachi, soups and apps. We only tried sushi, and the flavors were delicious. Fresh crab,  vegetables, great combinations. The only reason that i didn't leave 5 stars is because of the large size of the rolls. Most of the time I would Love that, this time is was a little much because we wanted to try so many things. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I am seriously still full from our AYCE visit to Mr. Tokyo this weekend. For an all you can eat establishment the food was amazing. The rolls were made to order and each kind I tried was delicious.  Highlights of the meal: Crab Rangoon - came in two little triangles with a delicious dipping sauce. Sweetheart Roll - as a tuna lover this was my dream roll. Spicy tuna and avocado inside and tuna on the outside.   Even though I was stuffed I greedily ordered another round of this delicious roll.  Menu selection - there were so many choices from basic to specialty rolls. Several soup and appetizer options as well as hibachi dishes for the non-sushi lovers.  Service - our sever was friendly and prompt. She served everything with a smile and pointed out her favorites and answered all our questions happily."}
{"text":"The death of the United States of America.  We've arrived.    I stumbled upon this place, so I had no preconceived expectations.  Looked nice and clean and similar decor of a sushi place.  Friendly hostess and server.   After I sat down I was explained the all you can eat option and the charge for what you don't eat.  Who thought of this?  Why?  Attract the golden coral clients?  This is the clientele you want?   Eat it all or pay the price.  I couldn't get that out of my head.  Every time I saw someone sit down I wanted to wait and see them sweating to get it all in.  Heart disease is the number one killer in our nation, and this place encourages overeating.   I didn't get the all you can eat.  I got a simple salmon roll, and it tasted like every other salmon roll.  Squid salad was also typical.    Ben, thank you for your reply.  I appreciate the fact that you care about your business.   Sometimes, we do lose our intension in translation and complexity.  I hear what you are trying to do, but I think you have over complicated it.  I go out to eat to find complex flavors, not a complex eating strategy.  I personally would appreciate a smaller sampling menu.   I hope everything works out for you."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best Sushi we've had here in the Charlotte area.  I know the name sounds a bit cheesy, but if you are a true lover of Sushi this is where you want to go.  The Sushi is fresh and well prepared.  It is not at all like buffet Sushi.  One of my favorites is the Salmon and Lemon...very refreshing.  I don't care for crispy, crunchy or saucy Sushi. They do have choices for those who don't want Sashimi or Nigiri style.  My kids are always looking for a special occasion to go here.  Almost forgot to mention they've got several types of Saki available as well."}
{"text":"This was easily the best sushi we have had in Charlotte. After trying several places and being disappointed every time, Mr. Tokyo was a very pleasant surprise, especially for all you can eat. I was expecting the quality to be low, but that was not at all the case. Each roll was fresh, vibrant, and well constructed. The fish was incredibly fresh. I love yellowtail and the yellowtail sushi appetizer was the best I've had... ever. The service was very friendly and professional. My single complaint was that it was very, very slow. We waited for a table for 30 minutes, began eating at 7pm, and didn't finish until 9pm!! That was an exceptionally long time for people who can usually eat a meal in 15 minutes . Seriously though, super super slow but I thought it was fabulous quality sushi and friendly staff. Plus, $17.99 for all you can eat sushi included hibachi, some entrees, appetizers, soups, and sides. It was an incredible selection. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I found Mr. Tokyo on yelp and being a fan of Japanese, I decided to take my lunch partner there for lunch today.  We had a little trouble finding the place because it's in a tight corner of a busy shopping center on Pineville Matthews Road.  It's the shopping center with the new Walmart neighborhood market and the Staples in it.  We were honestly giving up on locating it but found it at the last minute.  Once inside I was happily surprised to find that it was crowded.  The decor is soothing, I liked their choice of chair, above average.  They have an odd business model:  it's all you care to eat - but not a buffet at all.  You order your food (habachi or sushi) and they'll continue bringing you refills of what you ordered.  But if you leave food on your plate, they upcharge a nominal fee for the waste.  It's an odd way to do business, but I appreciate the thought behind it so we embraced it.  I ordered teriyaki chicken for my first visit, usually a safe bet.  My lunch partner ordered the same with a cucumber salad and an order of spring rolls.  The \"Cucumber\" salad is the basic iceberg lettuce salad with cucumbers and ginger dressing that you're used to getting at Japanese places.  I wasn't expecting it to be called cucumber salad, so didn't order any salad at all.  (To me, in the south when you say cucumber salad, you're ordering marinated cucumbers, tomatoes and onions served cold as a side dish)    The food arrived quickly and it was both visually appealing and tasty.  The rice wasn't dry and the chicken was actual chicken.  I was full after one plate so didn't need to order more of anything.  The lunch price is $10.99 which I thought was reasonable for what they offered.  The sushi looked good, but I'm not a huge sushi gal, and certainly not on the first visit, but I think I'll try it next time  :-)"}
{"text":"An hour to get a table. Another 40 mins to get food. Was so hungry by the time it came i wasnt even enjoying the food.  Way too small. Move to larger location. No one has that time during lunch. Wont be back."}
{"text":"My sister and I were craving some sushi and found Mr Tokyo on yelp.    I love the all you can eat deal at lunch for $12.99.  I ordered a couple of sushi rolls and some edamame.  Everything was really tasty and the food came out promptly.  I missed the fine print on the menu that said you will be charged if you do not eat a certain amount sushi.  Just make sure you do not order more than you will eat."}
{"text":"There is certainly something to be said for All You Can Eat anything, but make it AYCE sushi and you really have something to talk about. Throw in hibachi, rice, appetizers, soup and you're really on a roll. Were there rolls on the menu? It would probably not surprise me, I may have just missed them.  Just be aware of the pricing - weekday lunch is significantly less than weekday dinner or weekend pricing (same as weekday dinner). And if you leave anything, you will be charged for it - though you are able to take that home if you like, something you cannot do at a normal buffet/all you can eat place.  When it comes to quality, it is a bit hit-or-miss. The sushi seems to be made fresh, but most of it is lacking in flavor, even the ginger and wasabi had little kick to it. Appetizers were also made fresh (as in they do not seem to be sitting under a heat lamp), but could be pre-made and frozen, such as the spring rolls. Most anything fried, such as those rolls and the tempura took a while to come out, so it seems like they are taking the time to fry them with each order, but they need to take longer, since everything that came out wasn't done - all had some doughy consistency in the middle.  A similar problem with the soup: It was luke-warm, like they just had everything on a medium setting, and no one bothered to add seasoning.  The good news? You can get all you want!"}
{"text":"Deep blue & maki sushi roll are amazing. Service was precise and prompt . I will return with friends for dinner."}
{"text":"I finally tried Mr. Tokyo today and I was absolutely not impressed. We were a group of 6, sat in the room in the back. Some of us got the all-you-can-eat sushi deal while some ordered a-la carte. Everyone's orders came at way different times. One member's food came after another had finished theirs. I ordered the spicy shrimp roll and an order of the gyoza. Someone else also ordered gyoza. But their order of gyoza came over 10 minutes before my order came. What gives? It's the exact same dish! Our server was really sloppy too. She was also waiting on the other table in the party room and she happened to drop a roll on the floor. She noticed it but never came back to pick it up. When we were leaving, my friend accidentally stepped on it and there was all avocado and sticky rice goo stuck to the bottom of her shoe. Like, come on! I am also allergic to fish (but not shellfish) and I ordered a shrimp roll topped with crab. It was obviously imitation crab because after eating here I went to Publix and literally was doubled over in the cereal aisle with the kind of stomach ache I only get from eating fish. All in all it was a very bad experience. I'm not sure I can go back here. Only giving them two stars because the food all tasted good."}
{"text":"This is a very interesting concept-All you can eat appetizers, salads, hibachi, fried rice, udon noodles and sushi! It's not a buffet! It's made to order! For lunch it's $10.99 and for dinner its 16.99 which is really not bad. We came before 5/1 and got 15% off our check.   We came at a later lunch on a friday and there was a small wait. The staff all helps each other out so you have more than 1 server. The restaurant is very updated and modern. Very stylish and sleek.  We started off with the shrimp tempura, gyozas and seaweed salad. They were all good! I like that it's smaller portions so there is no waste and gives you more of a chance to try other things. We ordered 1 shrimp tempura appetizer and they brought us out two by accident.   We also got a few rolls and sashimi. All the rolls were very good and large. Very fresh too. Only complaint is that a few things were missing in our roll. We ordered the panther roll and it was supposed to have fresh jalapenos on it and there wasn't any. We also ordered another roll and they forgot to bring it. It did come out a little while later.The rolls took a while but we didn't mind since we were eating our appetizers. We got a total of 6 rolls and 3 pieces of sashimi. For everything we got it was definitely worth it. If we would of ordered the stuff we got at another sushi place we would of spent well over $70.   The service was fine. They were all very nice and friendly. I saw someone make a comment about how they didn't understand English well but that's so not true. They all spoke great English and understood everything we asked for. Since it's a new restaurant they are going to make mistakes. The mistakes they made for us were very minor and we are already planning on coming back."}
{"text":"God forbid you ask to move from a table to a booth. Came in on a Saturday early afternoon to an empty restaurant. Was placed at a table and ordered our appetizers. We were placed next to some loud noisy diners and asked to be moved to one of the 4 empty booths for a quiet place to eat. Was told by the waiter flat out no.   Asked to speak to the manager who was just as rude. He said no, tough luck, we won't know where to deliver the food. I told him there were 15 people in the entire restaurant. It won't be hard to know our faces. He said but if someone sees you move then they all will want to move. I told him that was unlikely. I told him we won't be back and he said I don't care, that's no problem. Asking to move to be more comfortable when you're already spending an outrageous price on food shouldn't be made in to a big deal and a spectacle. The entire restaurant stopped and stared while he rudely rebuffed my request.  .  I guess they don't believe the customer is right here. I will spend my money where I'm treated right and not with such disrespect. I guess when a place is popular, the guest is unappreciated.  They've lost a customer for good."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place on yelp! We were driving around doing errands and decided to try the all you can eat lunch. For $19 per person, it's a great value. Considering the specialty rolls are $12ish, 2 rolls and you've already gone over $19. We both decided to go with AYCE since we couldn't share unless we did. You get to order from the entire menu and the only catch is if you leave anything behind you are charged for it. We each ordered an app - miso soup and spring rolls then ordered 5 rolls and I tried the udon noodles with chicken. It was so much food! Definitely come hungry. Everything was very fresh and I would come back again. This may not be high end fancy sushi but it's good. It's not quite 4 star but it's much better than 3."}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant! The whole family left full and happy. The crab Rangoon and tiger roll were my favorites."}
{"text":"Myself and the wife are big Sushi fans, we lived in Raleigh till recently and we really enjoyed visiting the Orchid sushi bar there, when we moved here we were disappointed that nothing quite matched, till now.  Arriving at the venue you enter into a wide room with a sushi bar to your right and a series of tables and booths, nicely decorated and very clean, we were sat at a table where out waiter explained the menu to us, basically you have a wide selection of Sushi, nigiri, sashimi, rolls salads and some BBQ.  For our first round we ordered some tempura shrimp, aged tofu, yellowtail and jalapeno and BBQ Squid, I won't review the squid more than saying it was delicious and really a jaw dropper.  Everything was delicious.  We ordered some rolls next and same nigiri, the nigiri was the quality of other places in charlotte that charge premium price, there is a up charge for sashimi that may seem odd but the slices of fish are much larger than would be expected.  The rolls were great, we sampled a few and except for a slightly overcooked Dynamite roll there were well made, well flavoured and beautiful to look at.  The only thing i don't understand is how this place is not absolutely packed all the time."}
{"text":"We definitely needed a place like this in the area. The rolls here are a generous portion and quite delectable! I would say the biggest draw is the All You Can Eat option loaded with Sashimi, Nagiri, Hand Rolls, Specialty Rolls, hibachi, noodle dishes, appetizers, and more! Its a very fair price as well, however, my husband and I usually split three rolls and are absolutely stuffed so I cant imagine a need for us to buy an all you can eat option. They usually have four sushi chefs and they do quick work. The ambiance is very nice, you can come in for a casual dinner or dress up for date night-dealers choice. The wait staff is very kind and attentive. I found the joint to be very clean as well!"}
{"text":"Great service and the sushi is delicious!! The lunch price is amazing well. This was my second time here and I am obsessed ."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and it hits the spot each time. More like taking the spot and throwing it down the road since I probably overeat. They provide decent variety (not great but not bad), but they definitely give a good helping for each specialty roll, so you can't really try a lot of different ones in a single sitting. The best way is to share with a larger group to get a few bites of each.  The service is fine and there's always a little bit of a wait during peak dinner time. Don't expect fine dining here though."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious sushi. The grilled squid was on point. However, they stir fry the udon noodles which kinda dry up the noodles and make the noodles not that chewy anymore. I will definitely come back for some more."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch, the place so clean and pretty, the fish so fresh , I like the special rolls,that is so delicious, I will be back , good service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Casual fresh sushi in a strip mall Welcoming to kids so it's a nice place for family  Selection is decent basic to fancy rolls  I get the cucumber wrapped roll   Beautiful and really good. Not common to find that We had soup, special rolls, and several to share Nothing came out together. Every dish got delivered as it became ready  We were fine with that  This is our now favorite family restaurant"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Sushi place when I am in Sharlotte. For about 25 dollars you get all you can eat sushi which are always very fresh and tasty.   Hot tea is extra cost, but it's still very competitive. I have visited this place multiple times and every time was satisfied with the food."}
{"text":"This place serves All-You-Can-Eat sushi, appetizers, noodles and hibachi for a set price. If you plan to spend less than the buffet price (18.99 weekend adult or weekday dinner, 12.99 weekday lunch) on individual menu items, I'd suggest going for a la carte instead. They offer both options. The difference with here and other buffet joints is that they make all the food to order. There aren't stale looking pieces of dried fish sitting on a counter for hours, being picked apart by customers. You order It and they start making It so everything stays freshly prepared.   I've been to the Pineville location and It was delicious so I was stoked when this location opened.   Came for lunch on a busy Saturday afternoon with my friends. Two ordered off the menu while the other two, including myself, opted for AYCE. They were able to customize the rolls I wanted since there were certain rolls with things I didn't like. I don't eat raw salmon and I hate cream cheese in sushi. Since they make food to order, It was easily omitted. My friend ordered BBQ squid which was not good at all! The sauce was very thick, sweet and overpowering. But everything else we ordered was delicious. The tuna is fresh and oh so yummy! Shrimp tempura was crispy and piping hot out of the fryer. If you're hungry, this place is for you.   My only gripe about their AYCE option is they charge $1 per sushi slice left uneaten and their rolls were 6-9 slices each. They didn't overdo the rice on each roll (which would be a bit unethical, if you ask me) but it's still large portions. If you're like me, one roll is not enough to fill you but two is too much food and you'll be charged for food waste. I know this prevents people from over-ordering and wasting so much food but you can't take leftovers home so the chances of you having to pay $3-$5 extra is very likely, at least It is for me. I took off one star for that policy. I'd be more in agreement with It if they offered smaller portions so you could try a variety without fear of being overcharged."}
{"text":"I very much enjoy my visit the couple of times I have been to this location. Also we had awkward service at our last visit, everything else was great.  We had a little ditzy waitress that spoke very soft in a loud environment. She didn't fully read each of our tickets, so something was always missed when our order was brought to us. She would apologize and continue to mess up.. delayed on filling up glasses and checking on is.. this was also a Monday night with medium volume in customers.  Other than that, our food was on the spot. Freshness of the sushi and vegetables in each roll have a great mix together. We usually order the all you can eat option. And although that sounds overwhelming, the roll sizes are small; each roll has anywhere from 6-8 pieces. If you're like us and like to try everything, I suggest everyone order something different each time and everyone can share a bite or two of each roll.  The location of the restaurant has a nice little shopping/ grocery center.. along with apartment. Cute water fountain in the center of the plaza"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi AND hibachi?  Count me in!  My stomach wasn't as big as my eyes... but I had to finish or get charged extra.    Better than most sushi places I've been, for sure."}
{"text":"I want to die and be buried here, the food is that good, lol. I am so grateful to have this awesome restaurant within walking distance of my house. Sushi is fresh and the all you can eat model is amazing. I plan to make this my weekly sushi place, its that good!! Thank you and keep up the great work Mr Tokyo!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. You have to try it! Seriously....stop reading this and go try it! Great food and hospitality!"}
{"text":"While the sushi was adequate and the price was great, the service here is pretty bad. No one would approach our table unless we waved them down. Drinks left completely empty, order sheets waiting to be taken. You're better off sitting at the bar so at least you can hand the order sheet to the sushi chef."}
{"text":"The best Japanese food for the $$ you spend. Great selection of Nigiris and Rolls, the service is always good. I have been here probably more than 20 times since last May. Do come hungry!"}
{"text":"For all you can eat, you might imagine poor/low quality, but not at Mr Tokyo! My expectations were very much exceeded during my first experience and each time I've gone since. I got about once every other month and it's always great quality and stellar service for a decent price.   If you're not into sushi or would like to try it for the first time, I would also suggest going to Mr Tokyo since their \"all you can eat\" menu includes more than just sushi. It's a great way to experiment and fun for all ages (even includes chicken nuggets)!  They recently changed up some of the sushi rolls on the \"all you can eat\" menu which made tonight's visit more fun. I've learned a lot about what I like and dislike in my sushi rolls from Mr Tokyo. But be aware that you need to eat what you order or you'll have to pay for leftover food."}
{"text":"We are very happy about finding this place. This will be our go- to place for sushi. It is clean and service is great. The quality of the fish is very good and the rolls are wrapped neatly, which is essential to the sushi eating experience."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi lunch with a lot of delicious fresh avocado, jalapeños, and zesty sauces. Left the restaurant full and happy. Very polite, helpful staff members."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place because of the \"all you can eat\" lunch option.  But I went ahead and tried it since it was not that expensive.  I was surprised with the amount of options on the all you can eat deal.  I only had an avocado salad, tempura, and a few nigiri sushi options.  While the avocado salad was a disappointment (had one thin slice of avocado only!) I was happy with the tempura and the salmon, tuna, and tamago nigiri.  I am sure if you can eat a lot this would be a great lunch (and dinner) option for you as they have lots things to choose from.  If I am back in the area, I would definitely go back for either lunch or dinner.  Actually, on the dinner menu they do have sashimi option which I prefer to nigiri."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for my sushi fix... But oh boy... The sanitation rating... You really gotta consider the level of cleanliness is going into your body. The sanitation rating is 87.5. That's not even an A. They're serving sushi, some raw and it's not even at an A grade cleanliness restaurant. I mean the service and variety is nice at this place but just fair warning."}
{"text":"I came here again, but I brought with me my entire family this time (4 people total), and we were all ravenous. We came for dinner, and I think they raised the price to $17.99 per person. I recommend ordering on one slip of paper first and then throughout the meal adding more as necessary on the other sheets.   We tried some appetizers, including the seaweed salad (good, pretty standard), the avocado salad (sliced avocado on top of iceberg lettuce with some ginger(?) dressing), and the age tofu (hot, deep fried cubes of silken tofu- would recommend). We also tried the Mr. Tokyo bowl, which was a way tinier portion than expected but definitely get it if you like salmon (but it's limited to one per person).  Next, we tried the hibachi with beef, shrimp, and vegetables with a side of rice. I'd say this was pretty standard as well; I'd probably save room for the sushi if you were planning to order sushi. We also tried the udon, which isn't in a soup and was just okay.  Finally, the sushi!! We ordered the Mr. Tokyo roll, crazy roll, dynamite roll, phoenix maki roll, lemon salmon roll, snow white roll, and the volcano roll. With the exception of the lemon salmon roll, they were all either fried and/or drenched in some sort of sauce. They do offer the more traditional rolls and nigri/sashimi as well. I would definitely recommend the Phoenix maki roll and the Mr. Tokyo roll - they had the best flavor. Overall, the rolls didn't have super thick cuts of fish, but it was enough, and they didn't try to stuff the rolls with rice, which was a relief.   Service was great, our glasses were never empty and food was brought to our table promptly after being made."}
{"text":"When I think buffet especially sushi-expectations can be low-but the food here was surprisingly excellent! The selections were fresh and full of flavor! The speciality rolls had new and interesting combinations of ingredients.  The service both times I've visited have been good-food out quickly and attentive waiters.  Also delicious sakes if you want to try something new.  Been twice and this will be a frequent stop for those in North Charlotte/Concord/Huntersville who have been craving a good sushi spot!"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi is good for its price.  However, it has only a few, like 3 or 4 raw type of fish available on their selections.  NOT ENOUGH.  The rice seems a bit more on the rolls each round than the previous rounds.  rolls are big portion too.  The hamachi appetizer was not available when we got there.    Hibachi is decent, but not memorable.  Policy is not well written and confusing.  I wish they could have spent a little more time to explain it further.    I still like tokyo buffet near university, which I don't have to wait for the food and better selections on the hot items.  I'd rather they have a different tier in pricing to offer more premium items.  I don't mind to pay for $35-40 per person if the quality justified."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth a visit. all you can eat sushi! The dinner menu is $17.99/adult and $6.99 for kids up to 6 and $9.99 for kids 7 up. The waiters are very kind and the quality of the sushi is great. As in many AYCE places, they charge $1 extra for any pieces left. I believe 2 pieces are fine to leave.   They also have other things than sushi in case someone in your group would rather eat chicken. The ambiance is nice and there are plenty of seats and parking up front.   I highly recommend this place and will always return here to eat AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"So, I got to know about this place from a friend who was raving about it, I was initially wary of going to Japanese place as I haven't tried it anytime earlier. Will I come back to this place - maybe yes             Was it perfect - no I visited Mr Tokyo on a rather relaxed day for them and had still wait for 10 mins to be attended to. However, once I was noticed the staff came full blazing guns of about the various types of dishes, really commendable. Option of buffet with newly gained knowledge led me order various dishes they  sushi (obviously), sashimi, nigiris. I am still no fan of cuisine but sushi lovers can have a good time there. Guys, I like the fact that you charge us for leftovers, make it voluntary. Let people pay with guilt and not anger."}
{"text":"It was a really cool experience to be able to have the \"all you can eat\" option for the restaurant's entire menu. Great selection and the food tastes great! The sushi is definitely better than buffet sushi. I feel like the price is justified. I'll be back to try more food here for sure."}
{"text":"Was a fan of their first location in Pineville. Super happy they opened a second (much closer) location in North Charlotte! The sushi is high quality, fresh, and unlimited. I'll definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi and all you can eat!  Excellent combination! It's a very casual setting so you're paying for the food and not location."}
{"text":"Great food , service, and awesome suishi. The pricing was interesting because they have an all you can eat which forces you to get it. But I am glad we did. It was great!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is great I don't really have much else to say. Found this place on yelp and trusted the reviews. I wasn't disappointed and I don't think you will be either whether you go with individual rolls or the all you can eat."}
{"text":"What a gem! This place is a great secret tucked into an unexpected strip mall in Pineville. YUM! All you can eat sushi (made to order). It's brilliant that part of their \"rules\" includes paying for leftovers you don't eat..... I love it!!! Forces the family to think before they order and it's a brilliant idea for those nights when you're starving. I wasn't a fan of the fried items (the oil just tasted funny to me). My 7-year scarfed his selections (which included sushi, chicken fingers AND French fries. I opted for the spicy tuna roll (but ask for less crunchies as they sure do load them up!!!) too many crunchies takes away from the flavor of the clearly FRESH tuna. The appetizers were tasty and the Mr. Tokyo bowl (one per person) was by far the most delicious thing in there......we've found our new favorite sushi go-to. Much less expensive than the joints in Waverly...."}
{"text":"I came to this place every week.  Not exagerating.  I have seen them go downhill a bit.  The amount of fish you get is bad and they PACK it with rice in  handrolls.  Beh... Kind of heart broken but there is no way i would come back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I was skeptical about the all you can eat sushi but it was some of the best sushi I've had. Come hungry!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is well priced, especially for the price. Wait staff is really nice and attentive. The hostess, I'm assuming is either the manager or owner she is very unfriendly. She should not be the first impression when walking into the restaurant. She did not even acknowledge the group I was with for five minutes."}
{"text":"Had such a great experience here for my first timer. The indoor decor and setting was very casual and had some great decor. The server and hostess were very friendly and informative if there were any questions. I love the menu for the unlimited sushi/hibachi as it gives a variety of choices. The sushi tasted very fresh which is a plus if you're a sushi lover like me. I can't complain about anything I've tasted here and the fried ice cream was a good way to finish the meal. I love the concept and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and prices! Came for dinner around 6 on a weekday and there was a little wait, but nothing too bad. The sushi was great so I see why this place is so popular. This was the first time my friend and I've eaten here and she was highly impressed too. The sushi pieces are huge and tasted amazing. Will be recommending all my friends here and will be coming back! So glad they have another location as well. Good job, Mr. Tokyo!"}
{"text":"Good selection of food for a reasonable price. Everything I tried was so good. It was a little high pressure as they claim to make you pay for any wasted food but I had four pieces of sushi left over and they didn't charge me!"}
{"text":"Never failed my tummy!! When I am very hungry and need sushi in my life..AYCE! This is the spot. :)"}
{"text":"Great sushi , hibachi was just ok . Our service was fabulous though ! Will go back for sushi soon ."}
{"text":"I woke up with sushi on the brain. So I searched for a sushi restaurant in North Charlotte and Mr. Tokyo had great reviews. They also had a yelp coupon for by 2, get 1 free specialty roll. So I had an opportunity to sample more types of sushi. I went on a Saturday and ordered in person. There are about 20 specialty rolls to choose from, so it took awhile to mull over the menu. Ultimately ended up choosing the Dragon Roll, Deep Blue Roll, and the Rancho roll.  Service was good, even with takeout. I asked if the crab was real or imitation. I was told that it's imitation, but for a $4, they have real crab. Restaurants should list the crab as \"kani\" instead of crabmeat so people know it's imitation. Not doing so is a misleading. Nevertheless, the manager was very knowledgeable, patient, and the restaurant was obviously well run. I also appreciate when food is prepared in the open where everyone can see.   The Dragon roll was my favorite. Very fresh. Eel was good and the avocado was great. The deep blue roll was also great with pieces of mango. The mango tasted freshly cut and was crisp and ripe. Lastly was the Rancho roll. This was a risk, as it was deep fried. I didn't enjoy it as much, as the salmon was nearly indistinguishable and the batter was overwhelming. Far too thick for sushi. It was still tasty, but there was room for improvement with the Rancho Roll.  Overall, this was a good experience and I will be returning to Mr. Tokyo for sushi. I'll try their all you can eat lunch. Lastly, I like the look of the restaurant. I was most impressed with the ladies room that had a beautiful accent wall. Fortunately, I was alone and able to get a shot of the wall that I wouldn't mind having somewhere in my home. Lovely interior design."}
{"text":"This might be my new \"non-uptown\" sushi spot in Charlotte. We went for dinner last night and I was thoroughly impressed! We both did the AYCE sushi, which really is the best value, because signature rolls were $12 each, and it was all freshly prepared as we ordered. Be prepared for a short wait (10 min.), they move everyone along, never rushing, but it's a popular spot.   We started with the crab rangoons and spring rolls, which were both just OK. The Rangoon filling was sweet, and the spring roll didn't have much filling to it at all. The rolls were delicious and they definitely didn't skimp on the size or filling. We ordered the sweet potato roll, angel hair roll, sweet heat roll and sweet tornado roll. All four were equally amazing, but the angel hair and sweet heat were my two favorites. We also ordered the squid, which definitely is meant for a sharing table of 4, and that was decent. A little rubbery, but not bad, it was more the BBQ smoke was over powering."}
{"text":"Not bad, but I've had better!  It's not the freshest sushi but it satisfies the craving.  I got the lemon salmon roll and my husband ordered the rancho roll.  The rancho roll was fried, a lot of their specialty rolls are deep fried.  We also got an order of the shrimp tempura, more breaded than shrimp but it was tasty."}
{"text":"Sushi is my favorite food and this place gives the best quality sushi I've ever had. It's way too much, yet every plate feels like the one you don't want to miss. The staff is all really friendly. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I come here way too often... but they have such amazing food for such a great price!   The staff is really friendly... couldn't ask for more!!"}
{"text":"This place is 5 star and the sushi is so good.  The price is $16.95 and it is all you can eat.  If you like sushi, this is the place to go.  One fee and you can get anything, great concept and works really good.  If you want sashimi, it is an additional .50 cant per piece.  They have a lunch special, it is $10.99 and all you can eat.  Lunch is mon-fri 11-3 i think.    You have to try it out, it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere, nice staff. I particularly love their aged tofu, dragon roll and seaweed salad."}
{"text":"Really like the selection in the all you can eat sushi. Nice staff and good service. And the sushi is very good. Lunch is a better deal, but dinner isn't too pricey."}
{"text":"Clean and new restaurant! Food was delicious and service was great! Very good price for the sushi!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. A buffet that was made to order!! Excellent menu and service."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch Saturday.  The Saturday/Sunday is $16.99 for all you can eat.  The Monday-Friday lunch is $11.99.  Basically for that price you can order anything on the menu, but you have to eat it all.  I got 4 specialty rolls and then a few pieces of nigiri and squid salad later on.  I think I got my moneys worth.  I would have easily paid $9.00 per specialty roll plus the other items.  I got out of there, for 2 people, $40 plus tip.  That was for a total of 6 specialty rolls, 6 pieces of nigiri, squid salad, 2 drinks, tax.  Anywhere else in town that $70 all day long.  The sushi was as good as anywhere else in town.  I was a bit turned off by the \"lettuce\" in the softshell crab roll, but whatever.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.  I will definitely be coming back here, especially during lunch when its even cheaper.  This is a great alternative to Ru-Sans but the seating is somewhat limited."}
{"text":"I needed to start working on my \"restaurants I still need to try\" bucket list for 2016, and since I was in Pineville checking out a car off craigslist, I figured no better time to try #1 on my list, Mr. Tokyo. I was fully aware of the AYCE offering and I was more than ready for the challenge. You sit down to a check list and some golf pencils to make your selections. I ordered agedashi tofu, miso soup, avocado salad, 1 piece of salmon nigiri, vegetable tempura, and the snow white roll. I thought I had accidentally ordered too much but I guess I was hungry because I managed to finish it all without any problem.    Anywho, on to the food. The agedashi tofu came out with a nice small amount but it could have been a bit crispier and served with a little more of the dashi. The miso was the sweet shiro miso variety and was alright, but I probably won't get this next time, it was the only thing I didn't finish. The avocado salad was great, and came topped with a slightly sweet carrot ginger dressing, my favorite. The salmon was wonderfully fresh, I will order more things with salmon on my next visit. I ordered the vegetable tempura, craving a little something fried, forgetting that I had already ordered the age tofu but I sure am glad I did. It came out piping hot with a superbly crispy and thin batter. Super good but the serving was a bit too generous and took up a little too much precious stomach real estate. Finally, there was the snow white roll. I struggled to decide between this one and a spicy one, but the cute little waitress said this was her favorite so I decided to try it. I will say she did warn me that it was sweet, and indeed it did turn out to be a little sweeter than I would have liked, and definitely too heavily sauced, but the ingredient all tasted super fresh so I can't judge too harshly. I just wish it was a half sized roll instead a full size so that I could have tried more than one.    As far as the service it was super attentive, if not a bit too much so. The table next to me might have craved a little more attention from our waitress but we got to chatting about Japan, Korean dramas, and Taipei (where the waitress was from) after she noticed I pronounced \"age\" in the age tofu correctly....you know, it happens. Everyone was very friendly and the food came out quickly and hot when necessary. Next time I will bring a friend along so that I can try more things on the menu. Note that the price for the lunch has gone up to 11.99 for adults. Still a steal if you ask me. Please mow down RuSans and put a Mr. Tokyo in its place so that its closer to me....a girl can dream."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi I've ever had. All you can eat (appetizers too). It's so fresh and delicious. My boyfriend and I come here pretty much every week. The service is phenomenal as well. We try to come around 5 or 6 because it gets so busy!"}
{"text":"After trying the Mr. Tokyo in south end and loving it, we couldn't wait to go back but we're just never on that side of town, so now that this place opened we knew we had to come here. The service was quick, food was excellent however we ordered too much and ended up not finishing. Normally it's like $1 per piece you don't finish but the waitress gave us a deal and charged us for half. I wouldn't expect them to do that for everyone al the time so only order only what you can eat!"}
{"text":"My kids loved it overall. Perfect amount of food and great price.  On the adult side. It was just ok. Not bad but didn't blow me away.   Service was not very good. Waitress seemed a little clueless. And a bit slow.  Good option for a bite but not my preferred spot. Will give it another shot"}
{"text":"First and former, I never do reviews or complain unless it's something reallyyyy bad . & THIS is BAD. Honestly the sushi is great and all but I absolutely HATE coming here.  I've given this place chances after chances . First off,  servers are nice  for the most part but they tend to forget to put in our orders and would put it in towards then end knowing we would be full by then . I would not mind if you forget, but don't wait towards the end of our meal. We wouldn't have ordered more if they had  not forgot. They expect  u to literally finish everything including what they never put in the first place. We asked if we can bring it home , but they refused to let us . I understand they been having the policy of charging leftovers, but it should not be on us if it's the  employees fault.  And secondly, I can't stand the little Asian lady in the front, every single time I'm here I never had a pleasant talk with her. She's supposedly the manager but she talks to me like I owe her something but everyone else is always nice . That is 100% the reason why I hate coming to this spot . Hate it!"}
{"text":"If you decide to go to Mr Tokyo, go hungry to get the best bang for your buck. We went on a Friday night because I had no plans on cooking. We were immediately seated, and given an explanation of how the menu work. It's all you can eat hibachi and sushi (yum). Adults $18.99 kids 6 years and under $7.99. Because I have a kid that's random with his appetite I don't think that was a good deal. However they also have a regular menu, but the prices would push you over to the all you can eat menu. To avoid being wasteful they have a policy if you don't eat the extra food you ordered you would be charged extra, but you can take it with you. The food was really good especially the sushi. I can't rave enough on how good it was. I would definitely recommend this restaurant but remember to go hungry. I wasn't that hungry so I was full offer eating sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Thursday you would think they would have their service together a bit more.  The place was pretty empty yet we stood at the door for a few minutes waiting to be acknowledged by the staff. Once we were seated the lady instantly went into describing how to order, maybe this is my Type-A coming out, but I don't care to be bombarded with information when I first sit down. The concept seemed self explanatory and the paper menu you handed me has directions written. When I was a teacher my pet-peeve was explaining stuff that was clearly written, so maybe that is why I was annoyed, but not a good start.   We ordered a few rolls, salads, and hibachi. The timing of the oder was completely off, one salad came out. I watched my dining partner eat, I also watched my salad sit on the sushi bar for a good 10 minutes. I finally asked if I could get my salad and my waiter told me that they lost the ticket. There was a huge wait for the rest of the food and once they delivered the sushi we didn't have napkins, chopsticks, soy sauce, or ramekins for the sauce. - Seriously bad service at this point.   The sushi was ok for what it was, $12 for ACYE sushi....you can't expect something too high end. I will say one of my rolls had tuna or salmon that was not deboned properly, there were several bones in the roll and one actually got stuck in my throat for a few hours. Oh and one roll was so smothered in some mayo based sauce it was completely inedible.   Meh - better ACYE sushi places with better service."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and great food! The all you can eat sushi is definitely the way to go!"}
{"text":"Most amazing place I had ever eaten! Very high quality sushi. Me and my husband have 4 kids and pay a baby sitter and drive an hour one way to eat here at least 1x a week!"}
{"text":"I just left Mr. Tokyo Japanese restaurant. I was looking for a different sushi place in a different part of town that I'm living temporarily. This popped up with great reviews and thought I would give it a try. They actually offer all-you-can-eat sushi, appetizers, dessert, fried rice, and so much more I can't even list. The food was delicious. And the staff was so attentive and my food came out within a few minutes. I think this is probably the best sushi value in Charlotte. I will definitely be back with my wife. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This IS my new Sushi place!! AYCE made to order sushi....Fresh Sushi, Apps, Hibachi, Soups, & Salad...it is endless!!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi (including rolls) for $18.99???? What? And it's really good sushi? Shut the front door! 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious sushi and kitchen dishes .. I have been visiting this place weekly since it opened.. you pay 12$ and order as much rolls and menu items as you like but you have to eat them all or pay per piece for left overs.. it's a smart way to combat waste ... the food is always fresh and tasty and the service is pretty good .. the night and weekend menu is even better and worth the 18.99$ .. I hope they stay this delicious and affordable.."}
{"text":"Not your typical buffet, but pace yourself so you can eat all you have or you will get a surcharge for not finishing, which is a Japanese no no. It's a sign of disrespect for not finishing what you order back in Japan. But the food is great from the sushi to the rice to the sashimi to the tempura. This is the go to for all you can eat sushi. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"Really good quality sushi! Friendly wait staff and quick service. No matter if u go for lunch or dinner, u still get the most for your money."}
{"text":"Cannot keep up with the demand on the weekend. Came to our table and said cannot bring 20 piece salmon too many orders when we asked for the bill to be reduced all of a sudden the fish came out...sat for an hour and 45 all wait time."}
{"text":"Incredible service!!!!  I appreciate the no waste policy and the gracious explanation. Its arguably the freshest Sushi in Charlotte and it doesnt hurt that its 2 min. from my house."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. We went on a Friday and had to wait for seating for about 20 minutes. It was worth it. I love that they do all you can eat to order. The \"mr Tokyo bowl\" was my absolute favorite! We also had quite a few rolls, my favorite being the summer roll, which I think was seasonal. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"All of the food that we had was really good! Surprising for an all you can eat place but he whole family loved it. Las Vegas roll was awesome."}
{"text":"Excelent food and customer service.  Everytime we have visited it has been a great experience.  The ambiance and decor are outstanding"}
{"text":"Last time I went to Mr. Tokyo was a while ago but I enjoyed it. I love the buffet style pricing and ordering, it is very fair. Now the sushi isn't the most amazing sushi you could ever have hence the 4 starts instead of five. However if I want some cheap sushi for lunch I enjoy coming here. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have had Mr. Tokyo bookmarked for some time now. I purposely haven't visited because I was afraid my fear would come to fruition, which it did. Sure, all you can eat sounds great! But the quality was not all the good.  I went with the all you can eat for $18 this past Saturday. I started with the miso soup. The soup had more broth than seaweed and tofu; very disappointing. Then I went with the hibachi of shrimp and vegetables, no rice. If you eat traditional hibachi, you know that fresh off the grill taste... well that was missing. The shrimp were also very small and were over cooked. The hibachi tasted like it was lightly pan fried with a teaspoon of soy sauce poured in. Lastly the nigiri and sushi... not good quality at all to me. If I had a California roll, I understand it wouldn't be all that but there's no reason why the specialty rolls are not great. There as no fresh taste and some of the rolls with crab were frozen.  I will say the place has a really nice ambience on the inside and the service was spectacular. But, there are literally dozens of other places to eat if you prefer quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Well I I got lured in by the \"all you can eat sushi\" and besides it taking 20-30 min to get 2-3 pieces of sushi it seemed alright and only a couple pieces were fishy smelling so I didn't think much of it.... HOLY FUCK THE FOOD POISONING WAS HORRIBLE!!! I was throwing up for a day and a half. Should have looked up their health scores before eating (at this time it was an 87.5...) but I didn't think of it since the line was out the door."}
{"text":"Terrible!!! Against my better judgement, we tried out mr. Tokyo based on the glowing reviews. I normally stay away from buffets and all you can eat deals because the food is usually mediocre or terrible, but somehow we found ourselves here hoping for some good food...not looking for a deal. First warning sign was that it is not Japanese run or operated. Yes, they're East Asian, but not Japanese...not the same! I guess it's better than the sushi place uptown that was run and operated by Indians!?! Needless to say, it went out of business.   They didn't have sparkling water so we settled for club soda (they charged us for club soda, now that's a first). We ordered lemonade for my 4yo and asked for an extra cup to split the drink with our 19 month old. They wouldn't allow it - she can't drink a whole cup and we never intended for a refill. Fine, order another lemonade. Neither of my girls drank more than a quarter of their drinks. Then as we ordered, asked about sashimi pieces and the waitress repeated several times how there's a .50 surcharge for sashimi. OK, it's written there plain as day and we still want it. Then I asked the difference between a classic vs. hand roll, stating I want the kind with rice on the outside. Response: if you don't want rice, it's an extra dollar. Ummm I want rice but thanks for reminding how you nickel and dime your customers anyway you can. Also, if you're removing an ingredient and it's all made on request, why would you charge extra?? So strange.  Re: food, we started with miso soups that tasted like tap water and almost raw seaweed. I ordered fried rice for the kids, shrimp tempura, gyoza dumplings, spring rolls and cali roll. I've never seen a shrimp tempura look like that...it was also mainly batter and very little shrimp. Spring rolls were bland and Costco has better dumplings. My mother and husband eat sashimi and sushi often so they ordered the volcano roll, a few pieces of salmon and yellowtail. They were extremely disappointed by the lack of freshness with the sashimi. The volcano roll was DRENCHED in mayo and sauce - my husband felt like he drank a bottle of mayo. After our initial plates, we were still hungry but didn't want to subject ourselves to more terrible food. We regretted not going to musashi (Japanese family run) or Baku. I would GLADLY pay double or triple the amount to eat quality Japanese food and also not be reminded constantly about how much you are paying for the food. It was such a bizarre and kind of annoying experience. My husband apologized profusely for even suggesting it.   If you like sashimi, head over to clean catch fish market and request their sashimi grade faro island salmon or tuna. Pair it with some soy sauce, wasabi and ginger, and you'll have a delicious sashimi experience in Charlotte, in your home! If that's too much work, try musashi or Baku - much more expensive, but you get what you're paying for."}
{"text":"All you can eat?! Sushi?! And hibachi?! AHHH!!!   The food was banging, and I'm all for \"all you can eat\"! My friend and I ate our $14 dollars worth because that was the cost when they first opened, but the price rises up to $18 for dinner now. I wish they had to-go boxes for the food you didn't finish, but, the eat everything or pay for leftovers is a very unique way to be a memorable restaurant. I don't know if it's good or bad though.   Our waitress, however, was not great at all. She lied about her name to us and got our orders mixed up with another table. She barely came to fill our drinks and when I told her that I wasn't aware of tuna being in a dish--my fault for not reading more thoroughly--she went ahead to berate me and question why I didn't like Tuna and how she was flabbergasted that I didn't like tuna.   I love the idea of this restaurant and the fact it is kind of like Genki Sushi in Washington state except there's a flat-rate price, so I definitely wanted to rate five, but the waitress hindered my experience, just a smudge, or a big smudge."}
{"text":"This place is the best restaurant in Charlotte. They have all-you-can-eat high quality sushi and other Japanese dishes for lunch. The price is definitely reasonable, and the service is quick and friendly. I come here regularly, it's the best deal in the city."}
{"text":"Lunch all you can eat is fire You fill out small menus at a time, but they don't let you share, and there is a surcharge for what you don't finish.  They need to let you share appetizers in my opinion but hey thats just me.  The seaweed salad is some of the best I've ever had.  The nigiri is good but I wished they had some of the fish options from dinner on the menu including sashimi.    The tuna is some of the best in town.  They need to work on the nigiri as the rice is either not sticky enough or it is not prssed well. It's hard enough to pick up with chopsticks in this state let along dip into a soy sauce/wasabi sludge.  The red shore clam and flying fish egg roe nigiri is absolute fire. Their roe is super fresh and full of flavor, and crunchy.   Sometimes the wait is long and seating waits are outside the door during peak luncb times so get there early.  The talent serving you is pretty good. Make sure you tip they work hard.  Every appetizer is fire. Especially the tofu.  Never left here disappointed and hopefully when I go for dinner one day this will become a 5 star.  Actually it is a 5 star. If you door dash you can order off menu and request dinner options."}
{"text":"Took my 2 littlest kids and wife for 1st time on Sunday evening. Very pleased! My thoughts: FOOD - Excellent. So good, good sizes, well-made. Sushi excellent - as good as Sushi 101 with some cool choices. Everything we ate was just darn good. Would have loved to have a drink but they don't sell alcohol - which is fine and likely reason cost is so low. PRICE - Excellent. For the food and everything, it is incredible. Really. SERVICE - Good. People very friendly and nice. Tried to be helpful but servers forgot some of our order 2x and actually never came back with one of them after being told. Nothing rude - just not great service. Wait for food was, at times, pretty darn long...especially when you have 2 kids under 7 years old. AMBIANCE - Pretty good. Very nice interior, clean, open, not too loud. Seating was bit crowded but nothing bad. Bathroom was pretty nice but it was a bit \"dirty\" (overfilled trash baskets and stuff on floor). No biggie with a big rush but not great.  Can't wait to go back. Really enjoyed it. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Some people think this was pre-made....are you kidding??  This is very fresh, very tasty, very reasonably priced....priced too low in my opinion!  And out of the 10 or more times I have frequented this place, both for lunch and for dinner, I have never, ever had lackluster service.   I cannot believe someone thinks this place is overpriced for dinner.  You can barely walk into a sushi restaurant and pay less than $17.00.  And by the way, you can order as much yellowtail appetizer  as you want...just like with every other item on the menu.  If you didn't like it, why were you trying to order more?  The plates are cold for a reason.  Some people are never satisfied no matter what or where they are!"}
{"text":"I was ecstatic when we first found this place. My family and I came regularly and told everyone we knew about this \"gem\". The food is great, service was prompt, and we thought was \"clean\".   I took my mother here for the first time today (at 5:15 pm and we were of two tables) and here's the following issues we ran into:  1) the napkins that came out was stained (pictured) and looks used  2) I ordered the Mr Tokyo (salmon pieces) and it came out with a thin piece of hair. After the napkin incident and this hair incident, I still gave them the benefit of the doubt bc I LOVED THIS PLACE and mistakes happen. Correct it, and I am happy to continue being a supporter (my family and I comes here pretty often since we live within minutes of this place!)  3) our server apologize and promptly got us a 2nd Mr Tokyo, which to my disappointment, had another thin black hair. At this point, I was done and I could no longer defend this restaurant. You had a chance to correct it, why be careless the 2nd time around?   The manager came over to inquire about our experience and said she will void our unlimited, which I appreciated bc I was not going to eat another thing coming out of that kitchen. Since my son was eating the fried rice, we wanted to pay for what we ate. However, the server came over with the bill of $18.99 for the one unlimited sushi/hibachi. I was shocked, because my mom and I did not touch our food after the 2nd hair incident.   Our server was nice enough to talk to the manager and she decided to waive our bill, which truly should have been done without being asked. I'm disappointed in the service. Our server was awesome so we tipped him $20 and left empty-stomach. We will no longer be coming back here.   Please check your food (especially sushi/sashimi dishes) prior to eating."}
{"text":"I have now been here three times and each time the serves has varied, but I am sure it is hard to be a server at a place like this since people probably stay longer than they want.  BUT what do you expect at a place that is all you can eat? This last time they added a gratuity to our party of 5 so watch out for that on your bill.  The sushi is solid, but basic very similar to what you find in the local grocery stores. The sashimi is NOT worth the .50 per piece up charge so my suggestion is stay away from that. Also when you are ordering on their sheets make sure you check the correct column S for sashimi and N nigiri.  The place is small and if you can go when they are not busy that would be my suggestion. It is worth the $18.99 especially if you are going for sushi.  Enjoy and go hungry!"}
{"text":"It is very easy to do some solid damage here with their all-you-can-eat sushi. It's very good quality, they have a very good selection of rolls including cooked and not-cooked, plus there are options on the AYCE menu for the people who aren't huge sushi fans. That's what I'm talking about!  Despite it being the height of the lunch rush on a sunny Friday, the service was great and the delay for my orders was brief. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Whaaaaaaaaat!? I was very skeptical of the AYCE sushi.  I was thinking it was a buffet of some sort... Wrong!  18 bucks per person for all you can eat off the full menu, made to order!  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The fish was fresh AF!  The squid salad, the BBQ squid, the specialty rolls, the nigiri, the yellowtail app, everything was phenomenal.  The only thing I didn't like was having to hold myself back from over-ordering.  Finished every drop of food we had.  Two full-grown men were stuffed for $36 bucks.  My new favorite restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"EXACTLY what South CLT needed! Not only are the AYCE prices very reasonable, but the quality of the food is EXCELLENT! I've been there twice now, once for dinner and once for lunch, and have yet to be disappointed. The sushi is just way above what you would expect for the AYCE price. My boyfriend had the hibachi and though its not quite up to authentic hibachi quality, it's still exceptionally good for being an AYCE item. They do charge for wasted food, but that's what helps keep the costs so affordable for customers. My advice is to order in small increments so you don't accidentally overload yourself! Just an FYI, lunch time on the weekends is VERY busy, so be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best AYCE restaurant Around ! Awesome service , though there was an almost 30 minute wait . It was worth it ! They should look into expanding the restaurant seemed kind of small. Menu had several choices, sushi was the best ."}
{"text":"I've only done the AYCE here, but holy [insert bad word here] is it a fantastic deal.  This is the cheapest I've ever seen for AYCE with the amount of options you are given! Lots of appetizers, rolls, soups, etc. My main complaint is that there are not a lot of nigiri or sashimi options on the AYCE menu. I realize I may be alone in this, but I do really enjoy having some plain nigiri when I do all you can eat. Anyway:  The fish has been fresh at both experiences. The food comes out relatively quickly. The wait time is minimal! I mean, it is crowded and busy, but I've been sat pretty quickly both times.   I really recommend you looking at the menu and if you see a few things (or a dozen) that you'd like to try, do it!"}
{"text":"This is going to be very similar to my other Mr. Tokyo review!  I've only done the AYCE at the location for dinner on the weekend. At the price of $19, I'm definitely a happy camper.  Lots of appetizers, rolls, soups, hibachi, etc. My main complaint is that there are not a lot of nigiri or sashimi options on the AYCE menu. I realize I may be alone in this, but I do really enjoy having some plain nigiri when I do all you can eat. Please, please, Mr. Tokyo, add some AYCE nigiri options!!  Anyway: The fish was fresh, the food came out relatively quickly, the wait time is minimal.  I really recommend you looking at the menu and if you see a few things (or a dozen) that you'd like to try, do it!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while in town for a few days and decided to try it for lunch.  You can't beat the price and the quality of the sushi.  I highly recommend it and would definitely return.  The dinner menu includes more than the lunch menu, but I thought the price was reasonable compared to other all-you-can-eat sushi places for both lunch and dinner.  For the price of some grocery store sushi rolls, you can order anything you want, including soup, salad, or hibachi.  The only catch is you have to eat whatever you order, or you may have to pay a little extra."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and service. Although it does take a long time to get your food but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Grooooosss. The texture of the raw fish is wrinkled, which just shows the bad quality of the fish. They serve their rolls swimming in disgusting shrimp sauce and eel sauce, and this is coming from someone who normally loves shrimp and eel sauce. Anyone who truly has an interest in the art of sushi should stay away from this place - Jiro would balk at this place!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan but didn't do it right and go to dine-in for the (wait for it!) All. You. Can. Eat. Special!!!!  The AYCE is definitely part of the experience hence (yes, I can use that word in a sentence since this is a review. Hence, the use of hence!) the crowds forming in and out of the lobby, the doorway, and spilling out on to the sidewalk.  The sushi is fresh and delicious, the only two things people ask of sushi."}
{"text":"Not sure why the raving reviews. The sushi is mediocre to say the best, and they charge nigiri $1 per piece!!! Over rated and over priced. Not too bad for lunch, definitely not coming here for dinner."}
{"text":"Sushi was delicious.  Experienced some delays and mishaps in service but our server was very friendly.  We went during the first few days that they were open so I'm sure they will work out the kinks.  They had a long wait starting around 6pm but were not seating the full restaurant, so hopefully that will improve with time also.  Overall great food and we will be going there again."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place! All you can eat sushi made to order, awesome!   The first time I came was on opening week on a Saturday afternoon and it was really busy. They were just getting the swing of things so everything wasn't perfect, but was definitely better than I expected. I've been back a few times since on weekdays and it's never busy and service is always perfect.   Every server that I've had has been very courteous and always keeps drinks filled and food coming. I never have to wait long when ordering, even for multiple rolls.  I am picky about the rolls I eat, and I have found several here that I found l definitely like. Also I like that I can get salads, appetizers, habachi, noodles, etc in addition to a great selection of sushi. I love also that's it's all made to order and I don't have to wait in a line to pick old food off a buffet.   This place has become one of my favorite sushi places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"It's a very great place especially Friday nights where it's really busy we got there around 730ish and had a 45 minute wait. It was worth it I got 3 different rolls and some vegetable tempura 2 employees I work with recommended it and I would recommend it to others 20 dollars all you can eat sushi that's a great deal I'll definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding lunch.  11.99 for AYCE and it's full menu..  really good rolls, friendly staff, and enough avacado to suit my beloved.  All in all, i'd give 6 stars.  We did, however, walk out and leave our Minion toy in the restaurant, so if anyone has found it, please respond.  I have a picture of it with our plate"}
{"text":"They rush customer to pay check. I had unhappy experience here. One server put the check on our table while I was still eating and told us we have to finish the rest of sushi. While I was taking my time to enjoy my last couple pieces of sushi, the server came up and told me to finish sushi AGAIN! I am not 3 years old kid, I know the rule. And c'mon I am still having my food. I felt upset about the service here and ruined my night."}
{"text":"Went with a few friends for dinner last night and we all loved it! I ordered a few diff types of nigiri (squid, octopus, and tamago), the agedashi tofu, crab rangoon, BBQ squid, and 2 rolls (Mr Tokyo and Snow White roll). My favorite roll was the Snow White by far. I didn't realize they used chopped fish for the spicy tuna/spicy salmon mixes and I don't care for the texture personally. Other than that everything I ordered was amazing! I'll certainly be going back even though I live 30 min away. One word of advice is that they charge for wasting food if you don't finish it. We didn't have a problem with this since we all did the \"all you can eat\" option and helped each other finish any leftovers, but it's good to know while ordering."}
{"text":"In Charlotte area working and decided to try this place.  Sushi was fantastic and the staff was very friendly!!! I will make this place a must each time I am in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Great portions all you can eat for 11.99. Fast, friendly, a must try. Dragon roll, Angel hair roll"}
{"text":"Their buffet is so good. You order on paper and hot and cold food is made fresh!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for years for good sushi in this area and I have finally found it! The salmon actually taste like a high quality salmon that melts in your mouth! So good! The new lobster maki roll wasn't  so good, but we easily just told them and ordered something else with no issue! We did the all you can eat option and def worth it! Tempura was delicious, Tokyo Maki roll was delicious and my favorite!   Update: have been many times since opening and has all been delicious except this most recent time last week. The roll I got had shrimp tempura in it, not kidding the shrimp was black and had the tails still on in the middle of the roll! I was eating it and something didn't taste right, upon closer look is when I discovered that the \"shrimp\" must have been old and possibly moldy, I'm not sure what they put in my roll but clearly the quality is starting to suffer. It really made me question what else they are starting to cut corners with."}
{"text":"The all-you-can-eat lunch cannot be beat.  Unlimited sushi, appetizers, and hibachi items are included too.  High-quality nigiri, love the salmon, and it is hard to find eel.  If you're hungry and like sushi... Mr Tokyo never disappoints.  Hands down my favorite sushi spot: quality and value."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi place. The atmosphere and decor isn't anything special- nor is the shopping plaza that this place is located at. However, don't let that turn you off because the sushi and service is excellent. Beautiful presentation and excellent quality. Not to mentioned $20 for all you can eat, made to order, sushi?! Even the appetizers were great. Would come here again for sure."}
{"text":"We visited Mr. Tokyo on a Sunday, $18.99 buffet. I think this is still a good price for a sushi buffet, though we weren't really impressed with the specialty rolls. We got the Spiderman Roll, Charlotte Roll, and another one with spicy salmon and mango in it - the last 2 tasted mostly the same to me, maybe because they were doused in similar sauces. Spiderman roll was definitely not as good as spider rolls we've had at other sushi places... the lettuce inside may be to blame. The cheese rangoon was awful, tasted like icing inside. My favorite thing we ordered was actually the stir fried udon! The nigiri was good too, nice vinegary rice and fresh-textured fish.   We definitely ordered more than $20 worth of food for our buffet price, so gotta be happy about that. But I think the actual food is just alright."}
