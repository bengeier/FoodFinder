{"text":"Quality of food has suffered...I used to love it...last 3 tim s I went was disappointed....they better improve variety and quality ...price has gone up also...what's this of closing after lunch and reopening for supper? Whoever heard of that?"}
{"text":"After reading so many poor reviews here and elsewhere, I have to say I didn't have high hopes but I was really impressed with their selection. SERVICE totally depends on who you get and my bf and I got a great server! Also the food was really fresh because we went around 6 on Saturday night. They had shrimp (surprisingly fresh), crab (not so fresh), fish, calamari, big pork ribs, tasty chicken wings, a fresh salad section, sushi, and all the other staples. Their mint chocolate ice cream was yummy and so were their mini sesame red bean sticky rice balls. Overall, the TASTE is solid; pretty typical and standard for this type of buffet. If you're craving that kind of meal and you don't mind taking a chance on service, you'll have a great time. If I could've eaten more, I would've. A little pricey but you're paying for the variety, you can really go to town; there's a lot to choose from. DECOR is straight up old school so don't expect anything much from that department. CONCLUSION: I'd go back, just not for a while. I'm so full! Lol"}
{"text":"Mediocre buffet...

We ordered out and received the wrong order.   Wife is allergic to shrimp and received a plate containing it.  Called them back and was told they would \"see what they could do...\".  Just change the dish!  No apologies upon receipt of the new dish.  Won't dine here again."}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost !! The staff will harass you and make a scene if you don't give tip they are happy with. In my case the manager and owner just sat and watched as there waitress started to yell at me and my family for not providing her with an adequate tip !!! This has happened to 2 of my friends as well. !!! and after searching the net seems like I am not the only one this happens to !!"}
{"text":"Meat that taste like rubber except for the wings ...horrible horrible horrible ...when I got home I regretted wasting my money ...wouldn't bring my dog to eat there lol"}
{"text":"The variety of food is great, but I find they aren't very clean. The service depends on how busy they are. A little pricy for the quality of food."}
{"text":"I would not go there ever again. The service is horrible and bad. The food is OK, but that's it. It will never ever change. If you go on a Monday, Tuesday, Saturday or Sunday. Everyday is the same food and it is not special neither worth the money. 
Go to any other place you will have more value for the money. 
If the service was better I would have maybe gave it 3 stars. Especially the woman the \"greets\" you at the entrance. She makes you feel unwelcome and as if you are there to just steal the food. 

As for family, it is good. If you have kids then you can sit and eat comfortably, just check when they have a kids special (pay less) nothing so special other than that. 

Try it once and be the judge ! Let me know your thoughts."}
{"text":"We were in the area and my friend wanted to feast on a buffet so we came here. The place is huge! Their food selection is a lot! My friend seemed to enjoy the buffet a lot and he had plates and plates of the buffet - he's a seafood lover. Anyway, I know that there's so many bad reviews of this place but I would say at the time (this was in 2015 tho'), the food actually tasted decent for us. Some items were bland or greasy, but most were actually quite decent. I had high hopes for the dessert bar which looked interesting to the naked eye, but I did not enjoy them all that much. The only complaint is that our water did not get refilled, even though the pitcher was just next to our table and our waiters were just standing nearby talking with each other. We couldn't get their attention through waving and calling them so we just ended up grabbing the pitcher ourselves to get some water."}
{"text":"C'est pas si pire, mieux que certains autres buffets que je connais. Le choix est ok. Le service par contre ... ça reste à travailler, je sais qu'ils sont fatigués mais come on .. bref. Les sushis je ne recommande pas, car c'est S-E-C. Bon j'avoue que je ne suis pas une grande fan des buffets, mais c'est bien pour fêter les annifs d'enfants en famille, il y a beaucoup de place et je pense qu'en dessous de 12 ans c'est gratuit pour les enfants."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, an excellent buffet. Food was super fresh and seasoned well. Service was top notch. Lots of options to satisfy all tastes."}
{"text":"Barely deserves 2 stars, overly chewy chicken, uncooked ribs and flat beer, what is there to like? Besides the fortune cookies, the fancy colored ice cream is always an appeal but the experience is far from."}
{"text":"More like Fu Lame, overall terrible quality and lousy experience. Only somewhat decent thing were the mints at the end."}
{"text":"The food is great! The salmon and the chef's plates are delicious. There is a big selection of food to choose from. The dining area is comfortable. The problem with this restaurant is the price. First of all, it's quite expensive. I've been to better buffets for cheaper. Second of all, they automatically add the tip directly on the bill and it's set at 15%. That's not fair. What if the service was awful? It's a shame. Overall, if you don't mind the prices and the policies of this place, you should drop by enjoy some good food."}
{"text":"Best buffet in Montreal.... Quality-wise..... By far.

A little pricey but superb quality, a lot of selection.

Very clean buffet and the Wok is awesome (as well as the sushi)

Always eat here when I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Food is not fresh, tastes like left overs. Paid $16 for weekday lunch including tax and tip. Not worth it."}
{"text":"It's gross. I went one time and couldn't stomach the food. I gave it a 2nd shot. Made a plate, took 2 bites and left without paying. I don't know how people like this place."}
{"text":"Ok I'm not a fan of Chinese buffets because I never eat my fill to justify the price ($22 pp). However since the family wanted to eat here that's where we went. We were seated right away. Food looks kind of greasy. I did like the stir fry station. You put together your ingredients and they make your chow mein to order. They put the food in a tiny wok. 

The buffet food is very meh. I was underwhelmed with it all.  I did enjoy the coffee cake in the dessert station. Ice cream is the real thing. You scoop your own ice cream. I do think it's unsanitary because you don't know if someone made contact with the ice cream. $200 for 10 people. Not bad but it isn't great either."}
{"text":"Typical asian buffet, nothing against. 

They got their chef for \"Work\" station. You can put anything inside with different sauce that you like."}
{"text":"Omg ! Food is absolutely delicious here ... Im visiting from Boston and found this place through Yelp and I'm super happy right now ! Will surely recommend this !"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years and it's good every time. The place has a lot of seating and is excellent for large groups; no need to reserve as there's almost always available seats, and wait times are very short otherwise. Tables are clean and the dining area is quiet (the restaurant does a good job of putting large/noisy groups in other parts of the dining area). The food selection is large and includes what you'd expect from a Chinese buffet, including stir fried dishes (including a stir fry counter where you select ingredients and a cook prepares your dish in front of you), sushi and egg rolls, with a few extra things such as roast meats. Everything is fresh and tasty. Food trays that are empty get replaced quickly. Cake desserts are mostly underwhelming and similar to what you'd get at a big grocery store. The ice cream and fruit selections is always good. Though I've never ordered anything a la carte, the waiters are courteous and prompt to refill water glasses/take away empty dishes. Price-wise, it's very low for what you get (low to mid 10's for lunches and dinners). A safe bet if you want to eat at a buffet."}
{"text":"I never thought I would give such a poor rating to a restaurant, but when the only thing I thought was well cooked out of the entire restaurant was the steamed broccoli, the cherry tomatoes (that came right out of the package) and the steamed buns, there is clearly a problem. The sushi tasted like they were made the day before. The crispy items were not crispy but soggy. The fish still had a strong fishy odor, and the even the desserts were a disappointment. For $15 at lunch, you may want to just head over to the nearest food court and get better food."}
