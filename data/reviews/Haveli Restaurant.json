{"text":"Absolutely delicious dinner. Started with lamb samosas. Two huge samosas filled with ground lamb, minced potatoes and spices. I had the goat curry, my wife had the shrimp korma. We shared coconut naan to soak up the spice and the delicious sauce. The shrimp korma was a creamy, spicy sauce with cashews and perfectly cooked shrimp. I asked for a higher level of spice (5 out of 6) for the goat curry and it definitely had a serious kick to it. Service was good and the staff really seemed to want to make sure we enjoyed our dinner. 10% off the check for cash!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food. I eat it all east once a week and have tried all the Indian places in Madison on the search for gooey Cheese Naan. Not only does Haveli make excellent cheese naan, but their Lamb Saag Curry is incredible. If that weren't enough, the waitstaff has always beet super. They are responsive and eager to make sure it's a great experience every time. I come at least once a week. It's that good."}
{"text":"Beautiful people, lovely restaurant, excellent food. 

My only thing even close to a complaint is, when I ask for very spicy sometimes it's not the sweat evoking fireball I was looking for. One problem with serving food in the Midwest is everyone is running on a different schedule of what \" spicy\" is. I understand it can be a challenge to make everyone happy. But for me? I'd rather learn my lesson and adjust accordingly than ask for fire and get something else. 

If you work in the area and you have not tried the lunch buffet you are just plain wrong for not stopping in sooner. Why hold yourself back? This is one of the best lunch spots in the area, and the waitstaff is always eager to make sure customers are satisfied with their experience at Havali. {\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252

{"text":"Haveli is pretty much what you go to an Indian restaurant to enjoy.  On top of that, it has an extremely pleasant atmosphere and the staff act like true hosts and want you to enjoy your visit to their establishment.  I have read some of the previous reviews and find the main critics to be several types of quiblers.  Haveli offers a good variety of nicely prepared North Indian dishes with much emphasis on chicken options.  All of them are quite good.  Not heavy on the heat spicing, but if you want that, don't go to the buffet, as most people can't handle the eye watering stuff. The goat dish and the Bharta had enough heat to be noticeable, but most did not.  There were some really nice vegetable offerings.  The only thing we missed was a dal.

We stumbled onto Haveli a couple of weeks ago as we began to use McKee Road again.  It's only been there for a little over a year.  Took family with four adults and two small kids for buffet lunch and were not disappointed in any way.  This will become our new \"Go To\" Indian from now on.  The only really good review is to continue to go back, so we will see you again Haveli."}
{"text":"The dishes were average in taste. Service was good. Madison has better Indian restaurants Imo."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Amazing service. Cozy and quiet but perfect for a date or large group."}
{"text":"Ordered a butter chicken (chicken makhni) and garlic naan and roti. Chicken curry was too tangy - not what i expected from a good chicken makhni. Naan was alright and roti was terrible.
All in all food is pretty ok - more on not so great side.

Service on the other hand is good. Our waiter made sure the orders were taken right and kept an eye on regularly asking or replenishing stuff for us."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal at Haveli.  First time there before a movie at nearby Star Theatre.  Had the Tandoori Mixed Grill and it was awesome. A nice Raita on the side to add a little more moisture. I brought half of it home!  Friend had Lamb Saag and also raved about it. One comment is I would skip the vegetable soup. I asked if it was a Dal and was told yes but I would it say it was more like the leftover water used to cook the lentils. So just a broth and without much flavor. That is the only reason I gave a 4 vs 5 rating.  Very good service. I saw lots of folks picking up take-out too. Wish I lived closer for that but I would make the trek across town to dine here again even without seeing a movie!"}
{"text":"Haveli is a great spot to get some authentic Indian food. I'm a vegetarian so with limited options in the Madison area, this a great place to go with a vast menu that I can eat. I recently went for lunch and finally tried their lunch buffet which was also good and a great price!"}
{"text":"Absolute must go and check this place out. I ordered chicken shahkorma, fried paneer and cheese naan. So far best Indian I've had in Madison. The chicken was tender and such a smooth sauce. The little relishes they give are so good.

Walking up I thought it would be a hole in the wall, but when you walk in it is a pretty elegant place. I didn't eat in but wish I had. I suggest dining in.

Lots of food for the price. I saved the other half for tomorrow.

{"text":"I'm not an Indian food aficionado; however, I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner (take out). The staff was pleasant and attentive and prices are reasonable. I will make this place a regular lunch stop (buffet) and will  definitely return for dinner.  I just hope the building's curse doesn't affect this place like it has for the few restaurants that have been there before."}

{"text":"This is my go-to place for meeting Fitchburg friends for lunch. I wish their buffet had more options, but the food they do have is always tasty and fresh. I also like that the wait staff let you sit there and talk for a while without rushing. I love the laid-back atmosphere and yummy lunch choices, Haveli is worth a try!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a jewel. Best food-it's delicious. Best service-gracious and attentive. Best atmosphere-quiet and sophisticated. It is my new go to place for a great meal with family or friend. The food is fresh, delicately flavored and beautifully served. I am very pleased to have a high quality Indian restaurant in Fitchburg. This is a great addition to our community."}
{"text":"Went by and the buffet was happening so I said to myself, \"self, lets do it\". So that's what I did.

The food was good with a nice variety of dishes. I especially enjoyed the spicy goat curry and rice with peas.

Thank you for the meal. I give you my blessing. May your business prosper!"}
{"text":"Solid Indian food place, awesome buffet.  The chicken tikka masala has nice, lean chunks of breast meat in it.  The naan is fresh and plentiful.  The buffet even includes samosas.  To top it off, the staff is extremely welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"I barely eat Indian food, and in fact I never had it until last year. I've been here twice now and I must say this is some of the best food I have ever eaten. Their complementary cracker thing comes with a sauce that is really good. Their cheese filled naan is simply amazing. Warm. Gooey. A real treat for sopping up the sauce from my chicken tikka masala. And oh yeah. About that chicken tikka masala. I don't know that I've ever eaten anything so good. All I can think about is that sauce smothered over some rice. God it's great. 

The service here is impeccable. Both times I was welcomed immediately and seated quickly. The wait staff was quick to bring me the crackers and sauces and my drinks. They describe their meals well and take care to limit how much spice they use to your preference. Food came very quickly, perfectly timed with my appetizers and my conversation. 

I urge you to go soon. And often. I can promise you this is on my regular rotation from now on. I've got some catching up to do."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful.  I had heard good things about it and they were not wrong.  First the service was wonderful.  The waiter was helpful and friendly.  When I asked for a recommendation on the veggie portion of the menu he did not steer me wrong!  It was SO good (#2) and he was nice enough to keep checking on my spicy level preference.  Well done Haveli."}
{"text":"I went here to try the lunch buffet last Saturday and was impressed.I have been a regular at Maharaja for years, but I might now be an even bigger fan of this Indian restaurant.
The lunch buffet has a lot of great offerings.Though the space around the buffet is crowded and could be opened up more, the buffet items were delicious.
I had an amazing eggplant dish, the Tikki masala was so good (even better than Maharajas) and they give you a choice of regular Nan or coconut Nan. The coconut nan is out of this world! Their tandoori chicken was nice and tender and not too dry, also an excellent dish. I also tried their rice pudding and Mango Lassi which were both excellent.
I think being a newer restaurant there are a couple of kinks to be ironed out like making sure the buffet has enough plates and bowls available.The staff was friendly which we appreciated.
Maharaja upped their buffet prices on the weekend which I think was not their best move and not only is this place more affordable but I think has better food overall.I will be back :-)"}
{"text":"I have been to this place couple of times now for buffet, the food quality is becoming terrible. 

Restaurant is not for indians or those who like authentic indian dishes. 

Disclaimer: I am vegetarian so i haven't tried chicken or lamb entrees. 

Cons
- Not great food. 
- During recent visit, malai kofta was pathetic, other entrees were not that great either. 
- They had rice without daal. I don't think any indian eats rice this way. This restaurant is probably for those who are not that familiar with indian food. 
- they had one dish called aloo zucchini which isn't punjabi or south indian dish. Is this really indian buffet ? It tasted horrible anyway. 

Pros
- Excellent ambience
- Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Really good Indian food. All staffs are Indians, and food tastes like Indians' foods, too. Environment is clean and bright, staffs are friendly. The curry dishes look smaller but actually they are enough to fill your hungry stomach. Average cost per person is about $20."}
{"text":"There was no flavor other than salt. There were fewer choices than I am used to. Samosa and pakora were soggy. 

It was clean and the staff was friendly, though."}
{"text":"A passable buffet. Nothing special. 

The problem at Haveli, and the reason for my two star rating, is the awful service. It's a buffet, so the guest is doing most of the work. All the waiters need to do is refresh drinks and clear dirty plates, and they fail even in this. The last time I was at Haveli there were six patrons in the restaurant and three waiters, who stood huddled around the register chatting away and, for the most part, ignoring the patrons. 

It's fast and cheap, but it's not good. The food is so-so and the service is simply bad."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations!  The colorful decor and 2 walls of windows set the stage for a show of amazing food.  I'm not an Indian food expert, so my perspective may not be the widest, but this place rocks.  My dining partner is vegetarian,  and had the vegetables on curry (spiced 3 out of 6), and said it was among the best meals he's had.  I had the tandoori mixed grill, which is plenty for 2, (spiced 1 out of 6) and it was awesome, too.  We shared papadams for app, and a side of garlic naan.
On a Tuesday night,  the 2 waiters kept the moderate crowd well under control.
I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This isn't one of my favorite restaurants for a couple of reasons. One, they do not have a lot of vegan options as other Indian restaurants have and second, all the other Indian restaurants I have been to in town give tandoori roti during lunch buffet but the staff was rude in straight away telling me that they won't make any adjustments. I felt he could have said it in a polite manner. That's why I don't like going to this place. May be they don't want vegan customers :)"}
{"text":"We wanted to go to Thai Noodles for lunch, but they didn't open until 1 pm on Sundays. Being with a hungry bunch, they didn't want to wait (it was 12:26 pm by this time) so we decided to give Haveli a try.

We walked into an appealing dining room that filled with savory aroma. We were seated by the server and told the buffet was $9.95, otherwise we could order off the menu. Considering the price point was cheaper than other Madison buffets, we decided to go with the buffet route.

The spread was considerably less than Kangchen Indian Cuisine, which I had the pleasure of dining the previous weekend. There's a row of three stations connected, hidden behind a wall in the main dining room. The dessert station was with the salad and chutneys. There was one soup available, simply labeled Vegetable soup which was indicated as lentils based, although it was mostly broth with no vegetables that I could catch in my ladle.

The appetizers consisted of vegetable pakora, samosa, regular naan, coconut naan, and aloo tikki. The pakora tasted mostly like vegetable oil as the vegetables had been over-fried and sat in the warmer for too long. The samosa, while alluring to the eye, the turnover was again too oily, and the stuffing of potatoes tasted lackluster. Aloo tikki was better, although also fried, it wasn't soggy and the potatoes and green peas were palpable.   

The entrees consisted of; chicken tikka masala, chicken saag, a lamb curry, an eggplant curry, vegetable biryani, chicken tandoori, and a deep battered fish.

The desserts included mango ice cream, gulab jamun (cottage cheese fried balls in sugar syrup), kheer (think tapioca), and gajar halwa (grated carrots in condensed milk).

My favorites were the coconut naan, cucmber and mint chutney, mango chutney, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, eggplant curry, the vegetable biryani, and mango ice cream. I could eat the mango chutney with everything, it was one of the best ones I've ever had. The tandoori chicken was nicely deboned and marinated throughout. 

One of our companions kept getting plate-fulls of the lamb curry, it was delicate cubes of lamb meat, but much too game-y for me. The gulab jamun was overly sweet, I understand the core makeup of the dessert is being soaked in sugar syrup but it was too overpoweringly sugary. 

As pointed out before, majority of the curries are uniformly similar in taste. There was very little difference from the creamy tikka masala to the saag, all universally undeviating from the yogurt and tomato base. The different spices in the curries should be apparent, but here they were indistinguishable with no dissimilarities in the curries other than the vegetables.  

I'd rate the food 4 stars for the price.

So why the low rating?

As I was trying to capture the buffet station, a server abruptly told me \"no photos\". I was a little taken aback, to which he continued, \"no photos of the buffet, if you want photos, take photo of the menu\". I inquired why this was an issue, and he replied in broken English that, there are items on the buffet that is not on the menu (?). I suggested maybe a sign would be helpful in serving as a gentle reminder for other people (*ahem* @Matt W), to which he said, \"no sign, we tell people no photos\".

There you have it, I figured since the food is 4 stars as in \"yay, I'm a fan!\" but the awkward exchange above is a deservingly  1 star \"eeks! methinks not!\", which averages out to 2.5 stars, and since we can't do 1/2 ratings, I'll round down to 2.

So I'm not sure if it's a cultural thing, or if there's a secret underground society where the items at the buffet has a deeper, hidden meaning, that could divulge classified information pertaining to each Indian Restaurant, but there are so many options when it comes to Indian food in the Madison and greater area, I won't be returning due to the cringe-worthy dialogue.

Waunaking...you've been warned! ;oP"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Madison! We get takeout all the time and it's always delicious. The naan is so good--highly recommend the cheese naan! And everyone there is so nice and welcoming. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Haveli competes with the many other Indian restaurants in the Madison area. I recently enjoyed Haveli's buffet on a Sunday mid-day. My partner and I filled one table of maybe six in their large dining room. The dining room is much more beautiful and filled with light than most of their competitors (say, Swagat, Maharaja, Kangchen). Staff was fairly friendly and very attentive. Due to the small amount of diners, we never had to wait in line; this can be an issue at some competitors (primarily Swagat, though phenomenal).

Haveli's food was very good; all standards you would find at most Indian buffets were present. They provided diners with an average amount of spice. I would say this buffet is somewhat smaller than others in town. For example, there were very few condiments (i.e. chutneys, raitas, etc) and one of each food category except chicken had multiples. I guess how many items do you need? Even if it's excessive, I do prefer enough variety to have two plates full of new items (yes, my deadly sin is gluttony)."}
{"text":"Haveli far exceeded our expectations! There are so many good, authentic Indian restaurants in the Madison area but this seemed a notch above. The flavor was amazing and intense. I had the lamb masala and my husband had a tandoori mixed grill with some ridiculous heat! (He loves it that way!) be warned that they are not messing around with the heat scale. You pick level 1-6. I got 3 and that's where I top out. Husband played it safe at level 4 (like I said, he loves spicy), and he said he wouldn't want to go spicier. 
The prices were great! I believe my entree was $12.95 and husbands was $13.95. We ate the left-overs the next night so we got two meals for that price. Oh, and we ordered garlic naan as well and lamb samosas. I think the naan was around $3 and samosas around $5. It was all so good.
Server was very enthusiastic about the food! In fact, when my husband was going to leave behind some of his sauce the server came out with an additional to-go dish and said, \"you can't leave that behind! It's too good!\" He was right.

I can't wait to eat here again. I'll go with level 2 next time because my stomach was a little annoyed with me eating so much spicy goodness.

You have to try this place! Every restaurant that goes in the end of that little strip mall goes out of business. We can't let Haveli succumb to the same fate!"}
{"text":"The BEST INDIAN FOOD AND SERVICE in Madison. My husband and I LOVE coming here. I get the chicken curry with a little spice and it's constantly amazing. Im a wimp when it comes to spiciness and they adjust the heat all the time. The service is top notch! This place is. Family favorite!"}
{"text":"This place is damn good. I've driven by a million times and finally decided to randomly stop in Saturday night. I had the Lamb Biryani, the spiciest I could get it. The heat was for not for the faint of heart but that's how I like it, the spicier the better! It did not disappoint. My boyfriend had the classic Chicken Tikka Masala a few levels lower on the spice scale but it still had some good heat. The portions were huge, we took home leftovers and were able to eat the rest for two more meals. It reheated wonderfully. Mmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about it. SO glad we stopped in. I can't forget to mention, the staff was very friendly as well, we enjoyed our server. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"One of our favorites. We tried Haveli a little over a year ago and immediately fell in love. The food is delicious and plentiful (my favorite chicken tikka masala in Madison). The staff is attentive-- my boyfriend orders his meals there the hottest they'll go and they always remember us as soon as we walk in. We suggest Haveli to everyone we know."}
{"text":"I have only ordered takeout- but the food is always amazing and prepared quickly. The host and servers there are very friendly and already remember us which makes us feel appreciated. I have only ordered vegetarian food, but the vegetable appetizer platter is great to share with one or two people! I highly recommend. The spice levels are also very good, medium is perfect to feel like you're eating real ethnic food and not bland Americanized Indian.

UPDATE: We have eaten in and the service is great. Much faster and friendlier than other Indian restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"Absolutely a wonderful experience! Since moving to Madison area, I have searched for some amazing Indian food and couldn't find anything that really sent me over the edge. Then I met Haveli..Outstanding service, amazingly delicious food and a very good price. Im so thankful I finally found my go to Indian Restaurant. Can't wait to try the Lunch Buffet!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Haveli. We have been there 4 times now since we moved to the area and their food is absolutely fantastic. My favorite dish is the chicken tikka masala. The sauce is delicious, and the portions are always generous. The naan is wonderful as well, especially the garlic naan. 

Every time we have been there the servers were incredibly friendly and helpful. You are able to determine how spicy you would like each dish on a scale of 1 to 6. I find a 3 to be the perfect level of spice for me, where my husband prefers a 1. I also highly recommend the mango lassi, which is delicious. We will definitely be visiting Haveli again. I don't foresee us ever growing sick of eating here and so far it has been our \"go-to\" restaurant when we don't feel like cooking. Keep up the good work Haveli!"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently were craving Indian food and this was one of the few Indian restaurants that we had not checked out. We don't get out much these days with little kids at home so going new instead of tried and true is a risk. But this is a risk I am glad we took. The staff was exceptionally friendly and offered us just the right amount of attention. We ordered the shrimp curry, tandoori mixed grill and some garlic naan. Everything was wonderfully spiced and the serving amounts were not small. We walked out stuffed and with more than one meal worth of leftovers. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"YAAAAAAAAAAS. Definitely one of the best, if not the best Indian food I've had in town. Not to mention the service is fantastic. 

We arrived about 15 minutes before they opened, and to our surprise they happily seated us and took our order! I ordered a Mango Lassi (personal fave) and my brother ordered Mango juice. They were both delicious, and large serving sizes! They also came out very quickly. For our appetizer we tried the Vegetable platter. Everything was very fresh, and nothing was greasy. We really enjoyed the Paneer Pakora and Aloo Tikki.

We split 2 main dishes between the 3 of us. We tried the Chicken Tikka Masala with level 3 spice (because obviously) and the Shahi Paneer with level 2 spice (because cheese). The portions are really great for sharing! Both were fantastic, although the Shahi Paneer may have been my favorite. I would order it level 3 spice next time though, as I enjoyed the spiciness level of the Chicken Tikka. I'm always hesitant to order any level of spiciness at Indian restaurants as my spice palate isn't always on par with the chef's :) But the 3 was perfect! We enjoyed our dishes with Garlic Naan and Coconut Naan. Although the Coconut Naan got a little messy as the coconut was falling out of the bread, its sweetness combined with the creamy spiciness in the sauces was amazing!

We were way too full for dessert, but I happily left the restaurant with leftovers that I'll likely be enjoying tonight. Also - they have lunch buffets on the weekend! I will definitely be returning to check it out."}
{"text":"Extremely gracious people run this place and the food is both authentic, abundant, fresh and just great.  Highly recommended for lunch and dinner!  We hope Haveli is successful here."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch because I heard it had a good buffet.  I'm not a connoisseur of Indian food, so I really wasn't sure what to find. There were lots of new flavors I hadn't experienced, but I was feeling brave and gave it a shot. Overall the buffet selection was more than adequate, but for my personal taste it was a little lacking in 'non' curry/spicy options.  

To the individual who has an experienced pallet and taste for Indian food I bet this would be absolutely awesome!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Indian Restaurant in the Madison area. Fantastic food, great service. I wish their music would be a little more peppy. Still, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Another great Indian restaurant in the Madison area! Their service is particularly friendly and great, even compared to the other great Indian places around (Dhaba, Swad). Also, they have the best Indian buffet I've had in Madison."}
{"text":"Haveli! This is one of my top favorite restaurants on Madison's west side. Of course, Indian restaurants are easier then most when you're looking for variety of vegan dishes. Haveli has wonderful choices and I've been pleased with the flavor and serving size every time I go in. 

I've only been to Haveli four times, but the waitstaff has already recognized me as a friendly vegan who needs a little guidance on which items on the buffet or menu Are definitely vegan. Today, I had the buffet with a friend and there was only one vegan item available. So the waiter had the cook create a custom-order dish for me in the kitchen at no extra charge. Thank you!!

A few other perks of Haveli... The atmosphere is simple, clean, and comfortable. Tables are spaced well so you won't feel like you're eavesdropping on conversations around you. Lot parking is free and always easy. A great cafe is a few doors down if you want a warm drink after dinner. Or, want a movie? The AMC is about 60 seconds away. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly wonderful Indian cuisine, I had the Tandoori Mixed Grill. Huge portion with a mix of plump juicy shrimp, amazingly tender chicken and delicious fish, tons of vegetables and great flavors! They served rice with Tikka Masala and another garlic sauce, just tremendous. I ordered hot and it was not too spicy, next time I might order the next level hotter, but it was excellent in any case. Very attentive service, too!"}
{"text":"Wow! I ate here while on a business trip. I love Indian food, and this place is superior to my favorite places at home. The food is fresh and so flavorful, and the staff is beyond great.

I had the tandoori fish tikka, medium 3, and coconut naan. I can't wait until I'm hungry again so I can eat my leftovers! This food will haunt my dreams!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the Best value for really good Indian food around here
The food is fresh and superb and plentiful. The wait staff is very caring and attentive. I recommend this joint. The buffet is amazing and under 9 bucks!
Fabulous!  And I forgot dessert - superb!  Mouthwatering!  You have to experience it!And the. Chai is so good. Oprah should come by!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for carry-out on a early Saturday evening, and was impressed by the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. I had my two young daughters with me (3 and 6), and the staff were wonderful with the kids. Oh, and the food is SO good. I loved the Vegetable Korma, and the coconut naan is amazing. If I lived in Madison, this would be my #1 destination."}
{"text":"This place is very solid but I feel like the meat they use is not that great. My suggestion to others would have to be try the Vege Biryani (unless you like gritty meat and bones)..."}
{"text":"Now that I've eaten more Indian food, I have to agree that Haveli is one of the most westernized Indian restaurants in Madison. 

That's not to say it's inherently bad. As a native midwesterner, Haveli was the perfect introduction to Indian food for me. A friend from rural Massachusetts, also having Indian for the first time here, seemed to agree.

But now that I've experienced more variety, I think I have to agree that most of the buffet dishes are somewhat lacking. Meanwhile, the prices keep rising, and I admit that I find the waiters a bit overly involved.

Mind you, nothing is outright bad. And I think the vegetable soup is pretty flavorful. I'm just not of the mind that it's a 5 star restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"Awesome Indian restaurant good spread for their lunch buffet tasty dishes glad do not need to drive all the way to Madison now"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and quality of authentic Indian food. Consistent every visit makes it a joyful experience."}
{"text":"There are many dining choices in Madison, including Indian restaurants.  Still, we find ourselves returning to Haveli because of the quality of their food, cleanliness of the restaurant and general hospitality and good naturedness of their staff.  We've only been there during their weekday and weekend lunch buffet and have not ordered off the menu. I suspect ordering off the menu would be just as good as items off of their buffet.  But I am guessing.  Service is 
always very good and welcoming. They certainly do not fawn all over you--thank goodness-but they are always very kind, smile at us, polite, say please and thank you and it is clear that they are happy to see their guests and their guests are happy to be there.   We work to bepolite guests so perhaps it is just reciprocal which is awesome. It is just pleasant to be there, to enjoy their hospitality and food. We are happy to be there. 

They have very fair prices and enjoy supporting them in their business as repeat patrons.  Nice job Haveli!"}
{"text":"Since I enjoyed lunch, I took my husband and daughter for the buffet on Sunday. All the staff were very kind to my daughter, and made us feel welcome to bring a 3 year old who does spontaneous song and dance.
Since it was father's day,  several more young families were enjoying their buffet as well. I'm pretty sure they didn't charge us for a our kid- we had 2 drinks and 2 adult buffet trips for $24. 
Short of having a toy area, this place was very kid friendly. We will be coming again!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Service was excellent even for carry out. Staff were very friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! We stopped in with a part of 13 on a Friday night and they accommodated us perfectly! They had a very expansive menu.  For their dinner they do not offer the buffet, however it is open everyday for lunch. My girlfriend had the Shabu Paneer which was bomb. I had the goat meat curry which was pretty good. They have a spice level from 1-6. I had a 4 which was exactly what I wanted, just enough kick to leave a little spicy in your tongue. I could have withstood more but I was pleased. Since I'm close this will be my new Indian spot."}
{"text":"Dal tadka is really great. Also tried their paneer Tikka masala which was also good. Quick and prompt service, decent ambience. They have a wine and beer list too. The big bonus to most Indian  looking to eat home cooked food is the chapati which was fresh and nicely done."}
{"text":"I get take out from here every so often. I really enjoy their masala curries and naan. Their lunch buffet is also of high quality. Hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"Food at Haveli is always delicious. They have the friendliest staff in the surrounding Madison area. Great for take out or dine in. I absolutely love the vegetable masala, but you can't really go wrong with any of their dishes. I'd even go so far as to say Haveli might be the best restaurant in Fitchburg"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best indian buffet in the world. Usually with indian buffet some dishes don't taste as fresh as they would be buying it as a meal on it's own, but this is not the case here. The buffet is delicious all around. Spicy curries(not lukewarm!!) And briyani is always amazing. Highly recommend. Me and my boyfriend are regulars, the servers are very friendly and accomadting. They know us by our names and give us free ice cream and rice all the time. Make a stop for lunch buffet when you can!"}
{"text":"Delicious flavor and very friendly service! It's always the same 2 gentleman working there. They are on top of refilling water and taking away dirty plates. We always go for the lunch buffet. I'm a vegetarian and they always have at least 3 vegetarian main dishes available each time we've gone(some are listed as vegan too). There is always 1 plain naan and a specialty naan(spinach, coconut) at the buffet. Lots of natural light & high ceilings. You don't leave there smelling like Indian spices. The lunch buffet is $9.95 but pay cash and get 10% off."}
{"text":"My wife and I order from Haveli all the time, great service and fantastic food. There's a discount for paying in cash, and pickup orders are usually done in 10-15 minutes. The staff are very kind and friendly, and clearly prioritize customer satisfaction. 

I routinely get the lamb shahi korma, and my wife mixes it up. We are both happy every time - me with the consistent dish and she with the consistent good taste. We also frequently get plain lassis, and they are delicious! Naan is very good too, have tried every one and love dipping them in our main courses!! 

If you like Indian food and are in the area, I whole heartedly recommend Haveli. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best Indian we've had in Madison. The shahi paneer is especially good. We typically prefer vegetarian options when ordering Indian food. Lentil dishes tend to be a bit over cooked. And the aloo ghobi lacks flavor. But there are lots of other good dishes to choose from. And whether you dine in or pick up takeout, there's always great service."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the area. Hands down. Got the pad panang it was so good I had multiple bowls of rice with it. Also the Tom yum soup was awesome with so much mushrooms. I love mushrooms! We will definitely visit here regularly. The service was also great, the servers filled up our drinks constantly and were attentive to our desires. Best Thai place ever"}
{"text":"Food is ok. No halal option and they seem to get annoyed if you ask ! I used to go when they were nicer."}
{"text":"Great service! Their lunch buffet has lots of vegetarian options, which is great. Food isn't very spicy, which is a make or break for some, but it's very flavorful."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, friendly staff, and most importantly- amazing food! We had the chicken tikka masala and lamb madras with garlic naan and it was very good! This will definitely become a regular for me and my fiancé!"}
{"text":"Haveli stayed open late for us and provided great service! Their food is always amazing and the staff is incredibly friendly!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in town, bar none. Service is incredibly friendly and generally quick. Garlic naan is out of this world. We get take out here once a week because otherwise the cravings get too strong. Lunch buffet is a great value, but a little bland considering i like my good with a bit more heat. Great business to have here in Fitchburg."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes, yes, YES! I have been here twice for the lunch buffet, and I LOVE IT! Granted, this is totally an Indian buffet for the Fitchburg crowd (read: white people who don't like spicy food), but since I happen to be exactly that, I love it! All of their lunch dishes are flavorful and varied, including a good mix of meat and vegetarian options. Some of my favorites include the naan and rice (of course), the goat, and the vegetable curry. 

Our first visit there was shortly after they opened, so it was clear they were working to build up their customer base. We had several staff stop by our table to ask how everything was, and they were super friendly. 

The $8.95 lunch buffet is excellently priced and well worth your time. I'm generally not a huge fan of buffets, but theirs is very well maintained and clean, and they constantly bring out fresh food to keep things from tasting overcooked or dry.

They do also make to-order dishes at dinner time, so you can adjust your spice level as you like at those times.

Pro tip: Pay in cash to get a 10% discount."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Tuesday, a great night to go out to eat. 5-star service, wonderful food and reasonable prices. Great vegetable appetizer sampler, not greasy in the least, all of it was light and crispy. Entrees were very good as well. Decent prices and a really nice location. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple, food here is really really good.  Like really good.  From the samosa (get the lamb, trust me!) to the delicious warm naan, everything my husband and I tried was delicious.  Even my glass of Riesling was refreshing and a generous pour.  Atmosphere-wise, a few too many families trying to convince their distracted toddlers to try tandoori chicken for the first time.  My advice, just don't.  Service was good, our waiter was super-friendly and quick.  

Portions were a little small for the price.  My $14 chicken korma was awesome but the silver bowl is came in was kinda small.  I'm sorry but I enjoy Indian food leftovers!  My husband had to tandoori mixed grill and it was super tasty.  A bit heavy on the peppers and onions - more meat & fish would have been appreciated.  If you can handle spice, go for the medium.  It's plenty.

Yes, we'll definitely be going back.  Want to check out the lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch buffet and was pleasantly surprised! It was delicious and hit the spot! I don't know if they rotate the menu but had some lamb and goat stew and curry dishes, fried naan bread was heavenly, fish pakora and the mango ice cream to top it off was soooo creamy and good! Next time I will try the mango lassi! So happy I stopped in! 5 stars because I couldn't find anything wrong, will be back!"}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of Indian fare and reading the positive reviews this establishment had received, I couldn't wait to give it a try.

I was not disappointed.

I treated my wife to their buffet and, together, we just about tried the tremendous assortment of dishes served.  Curries, tikka masala, chutneys, rices, naan, sauces, even the side dishes (veggies) were flavorful.  Service was attentive and outstanding.  Prices were super reasonable.

I've only been there once and already this place is a top-5 fave in Wisconsin.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Havelli is my go to Indian restaurant in Madison, having tried most on the Westside, Downtown, and Fitchburg.
The staff are friendly and provide great service, quick to respond to any request. Only after my second visit they remembered my name and offered suggestions besides my go to Chicken Tikka Masala. The weekend / lunch buffet is a great value too.
Will absolutely keep going here as my go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Service is great, atmosphere is pleasant. My friend and I ordered one dish and one dessert, each--no drinks (water only).  The bill (with tip) was $50.  Was it worth it? Yes, I think so. 

The table was set with papadam and chutneys, and these chutneys tasted fresh and lovely. I shamelessly ate the rest of the green one with a spoon, it was so good. lol

I had the veggie korma. I judge all Indian restaurants by their veggie korma, and this was a standout, I thought. There was enough that I had to take some home (this will probably be the case here, so if you like the planet, I'd advise bringing your own to-go container).

The naan was soft and perfect, and did a great job of mopping up any errant korma sauce on my plate.

My friend ordered a vegetarian eggplant dish that neither of us recognized, and she was super happy with it. I tried a bite--YUM!

For dessert, she had the rice pudding, and I had the little fried cheese balls. Holy cow, they were tasty--a much deeper profile than donut holes, though they looked just like 'em.  I was hoping they'd have the cottage cheese-like balls in cream, but alas, they did not. Still, I was thrilled with the consolation dish.

I will definitely come back, but because of the price, it probably won't be as often as I'd like.  Maybe a monthly treat."}
{"text":"Came highly recommended by a friend for dinner. Lots of Indian mainstays on the menu. Very impressive selection of Naan. I, for one, had the garlic variety which was excellent with my lamb masala.  The place was immaculate in terms of cleanliness, and we came in after the typical dinner rush. Waitstaff were very friendly and accommodating. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Indian buffets, so I go to a lot of them, but this one was somewhat inadequate. Granted, all the ones I've been to have been on the East Coast, so this might be great for Madison/Wisconsin. I got my usual mango lassi to accompany my meal, and it came with whipped cream and maraschino cherries and what seemed to be grenadine. Why would you do that? Not only does the mango not taste like real mango, the lassi came out way sweeter than any I've had and probably sweeter than any proper lassi you'd find in India. In a similar vein, the food was OK, but it was missing the potency so signature of Indian spice, that fragrance that's supposed to envelop you when at Indian restaurants. Where is the meaty grilledness in the tandoori chicken? Where is that earthy cumin in your samosa? Everything just tasted kind of...impotent. I can't tell if it's because they're trying to pander to Midwestern tastes or if they're skimping on the spices for business reasons, but I left the place without the taste of pungency that I was really hoping to load up on when I go to Indian buffets.

PS - After reading a few reviews from some Indian customers that also mentioned that they could improve their flavor, I feel like less of a crazy person. It seems that they're spiced just OK for Midwestern palates but could be missing something if you're looking for really traditional Indian food."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to being open minded enough to try Indian food, we are typically pub food or bust when it comes to going out to eat. We came here with some friends who are way more adventurous than we are, and boy are we glad we did! I don't have much to compare to, but my butter chicken dish was AWESOME. My husband also loved the lamb curry. We split cheese naan, which complemented the spice from the food well. I really like that they also give a choice of spice level - 3 was perfect for me! It was enough heat to taste but you could still get all of the flavors of the food.

Service was speedy and he made some jokes with our friends who are regulars. The space was clean and had a nice decor. Again I don't have much to compare price too as far as Indian restaurants go, but for the amount of food we received the price seemed fair. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some co-workers. Didn't know anything about this place because a friend suggested it. I love Indian food, I'll put that out there right now. This place is great. During lunch they have the buffet for $10. If you pay cash they take 10% off. So basically you pay $9 if you have cash. 

I was surprised that they had as many options that they did. I was also surprised that the food was as fresh as it was. I'm not a fan of buffets. I'd rather go to a restaurant and eat because the food is more fresh. Was not disappointed at all. They have all the favorites. Samosas, naan, chicken tikka masala etc. They also have vegetarian and vegan curries as well. All dishes were delicious and flavorful. The Naan and samosas were soft and warm. I thought they would be dry from the heat but they were perfect. I put down 4 full plates of food and had enough room for mango ice cream. 

Service was good and the restaurant was clean. If I lived closer to this place I would go here more often and would try their dinner menu. Based on the lunch buffet I assume that their dinners are great as well."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Indian Restaurant in Madison (Fitchburg).  We especially like the lamb curry which we often pick up - only takes them 20 minutes to make and available in varying levels of spice.  Also includes delightful chutney/relish sides.  Very nice."}
{"text":"It's always a gamble  when you visit a restaurant on their opening night.  Luckily, there was no \"walking away, knowing when to run\" from me as Haveli delivered.  I'll be honest...this location has been haunted by former failed restaurants (Fitch's, Good Times, Kickshaw, Jimmy's) and their gigantic footprint.  In this case, the owners did the right thing and only used 1/3 of the former space.  Service was pleasant and efficient.  We ordered Samosas for our appetizer and Aloo Mutter and Goat Curry for our entrees.  While the filling of the Samosas was a little too heavy for my liking, the crust that encased it was great. Both entrees were very solid.  The flavors worked well with one another.  I was particularly impressed with the Goat Curry.  In the past at other places, the meat can be a little too \"goaty\".  Here is was well flavored and fall apart tender.
Haveli also has a lunch time buffet that I am eager to try.

Still early in it's existence but if it continues to dish out great food, I think it will be around to stay."}
{"text":"Great service, super friendly staff, delicious food! And everything is so clean. It doesn't even smell too much. Not that I mind Indian food smell - but most times I go to Indian restaurants I come out smelling like curry and the smell will linger all day... Here, I could smell the food from the door, but didn't feel like it permeated into all my pores and clothing and hair. In fact, it's five minutes now since I came out and I don't smell!

But more importantly, the food was very good. I loved the pork curry and chicken masala as well as the spinach naan. I did want to try the mango ice cream but it was all puddly by the time I was done with my food so I didn't try it. 

Beef broccoli was also super yummy. People kept taking all the meat though and the kitchen couldn't keep up.

Definitely will come back when in Madison!"}
{"text":"Food was average, service was terrible. Server saw a single girl and won't leave me alone. Got sick with the food. They are not getting my money anymore."}
{"text":"Executive summary:  great food, especially for vegetarians and gluten-sensitive folks.  Good service.  Clean restrooms.  Ample parking.   

I think my favorite dish is the shahi paneer.  No, the vegetable korma.  No, wait, bhindi masala...argh, I can't pick just one!  Lots of vegetarian options here, which I love!  Even some vegan options labeled as such on the menu.  They also have tons of chicken, lamb, seafood and beef dishes and a few pork options.  And of course naan and mango lassi.

Service is good.  I've always had attentive servers.  My water glass is rarely empty, food arrives promptly.  They can be a little slow bringing the check though.  I think maybe they're giving me time to finish my meal but oh, no, I want a to go box so I can enjoy this food again tomorrow!  The bowls of curry seem small when they first set them on the table but I don't think I've ever finished a full one in one sitting.  Especially not if we have an order of naan for the table.

The restroom is a single seater located in the entry vestibule.  It's always been clean and well stocked when I've been there.

There's lots of parking available outside the restaurant and in the surrounding strip mall.

This is definitely one of my top three favorite Indian places in Madison.  Whether it's number 1, 2, or 3 mostly depends on which one I've been to last."}
{"text":"The buffet is amazing and inexpensive. Cheaper than some of the other Indian restaurants in the area. The decor was beautiful and like the traditional paintings all around the restaurant. The tandoori chicken was great, the meat just came easily off the bones. The tadka daal was superb. Tasted a bit like home which was just awesome. The staff were very kind and courteous to everyone. There were only two servers at the time we went and it was quite busy. But they made sure that all of the guests were taken care of. For dessert I definitely recommend the mango ice cream. Also instead of water or soft drink I would recommend the lassi (salty or sweet) along with the meal. I have to say my new favorite Indian restaurant in the Madison area for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has got such a high rating.. I have tried almost every indian place in madison and this one surely is in the bottom.. Tried buffet and it was just pathetic, minimum options and so so food.. There are better places like amber and swagat.. This is Over rated!!Also not to forget we all ended up with upset stomachs so there is the cherry on top!!"}
{"text":"Place sets itself apart with warm hospitality. Friendly and attentive wait staff. Lots of cjlhoicea for authentic dishes.

For a group with varies tastes, they will make dishes as spicy or as mild as you want. The spinach Naan was a big hit at our table. The mango Lassi is must order even for a dessert. 

Would definitely came again."}
{"text":"Extremely tasty homemade Indian fare served by the nicest staff you'll ever meet. Haveli offers an impressive selection while still surpassing expectations on classic menu staples. A nice first try at Haveli might include the Tandoori Mixed Grill, offering you the restaurant's take on tandoori chicken and shrimp, as well as seekh kabab. The friendly staff is will customize to your spice preference. The lunch buffet at $8.95 is a steal, and the all-you-can-eat fare is of the same quality as ordering off the menu. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Have had several excellent meals at this Indian restaurant. I've had both their lunch buffet and multiple sit-down meals. Everything has been excellent!

I can recommend everything I've had there, Chicken Biryani, Mutter Paneer, Chicken Tikka Masa, Samosa, Pakora, etc, etc. 

Service is also always excellent. 

Will continue to return to this great local restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum! We came here for dinner before going to a movie down the street and we had a good time! We ordered samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala and the Butter Chicken. I asked for extra spice in the Tikka Masala and it sure was spicy! We also ordered the mango ice cream which was THE BEST part of our dinner. I definitely recommend ordering the ice cream, which is also made in house."}
{"text":"Just went there tonight, my wife had been there with friends before and liked it.  The first thing you notice is the friendliness of the staff and personal attention.  The next is the choices of food in different categories.  And last is the quality and taste of the food.  The food was great, and servings were big.  I always can't stop eating the good food and this was the case here.  The restaurant is not a large one.  And although about 3/4 full, the noise was manageable and you could talk and converse and hear each other.  The prices are very good for the quality of food and service.  There are a number of Indian restaurants around but not in this area of town or close to the near West Side.  I would rank it one of the best for the size and quality of food.  I would go there with friends or family any time to get great food and service.  They have a lunch buffet that I will be trying soon. Also does carry out when you don't feel like sitting down.  Please go to this restaurant.  The space has changed hands many times with pubs, and wanna be steakhouses.  This restaurant deserves to be around for a while."}
{"text":"I hate buffets but this is a solid 3 star buffet. The buffet area was constant kept clean and food was brought our regularly. They offer mostly curry dishes which is a huge plus for me. It varies from chicken, to vegetarian to goat curry dishes. They serve cheese and garlic naan bread with the curries.

Everything was delish. I will say that I was turned off a bit by the chicken curries having dark and white meat in it. Of all the chicken curries I've had, they were cooked with white meat only and being someone who only eat chicken breast, it was a bit of a turn down. However, the sauce and rice were great and there were some chicken breast pieces in the curries at least. 
 
We dinned in a Sunday afternoon where lunch buffet was served for $8.95. Great price. For dinner, you can only order off of the menu. Shockingly for a early Sunday lunch, they had plenty of customers. Wait staff were very friendly and prompt. 

Interesting note, my boyfriend and I noticed how similar the establishment was to Dhaba Indian Bistro out in Middleton.  We asked the server if there was a coincidence and come to find out, they are a sister restaurant of Dhaba. That being said, if you like Dhaba, you'll liked Heveli. The big difference is Dhaba doesn't have a buffet.

While the buffet was good, I think is enjoy ordering off the menu instead. I will try that next time. 

I would recommend Heveli's for anyone who loves curry. I will be back to dine in the future."}
{"text":"Both the lunch buffet and the dinner menu are fantastic, both in quality and range of options. The price is reasonable too. My favorite Indian place in Madison!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Haveli. I have been there several times and I have never been disappointed. The staff is friendly and the food is always good. We usually go for the lunch buffet. I highly recommend Haveli for a yummy lunch or a romantic date night."}
{"text":"I love this place, their food, their service, the atmosphere. I want to know why Saira L. thought it was just \"OK\"? Is it Americanized? I have not had the pleasure of eating in India, but many of my co-workers from Bangalore love this place, too. Hope you love it as well!"}
{"text":"Both the menu and buffet are awesome. There are a lot of choices in the menu. You can also choose rice or nun to go with your meal. Buffet includes all kind of stuff. From lamb to vegetarian. Take outs are really fast. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love the buffet. A really great way to sample some stuff you've never tried before. The staff is super friendly too."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet! There were plenty of different options (even four different dessert options). Buffet was warm and well stocked. The wait staff was friendly. 

I think it was less spicy than most Indian restaurants that I've tried but I enjoyed that."}
{"text":"I've been to Haveli a few times now, and today was the first time I'd been through the lunch buffet. I have never been disappointed and today was no exception.

The staff are, as others say, extremely friendly and attentive. Every dish I've tried has fantastic flavor, and the servings are just right. The naan is chewy, the desserts sweet and the chai is tasty. They offer a wide range when it comes to level of spiciness, so I'm sure anyone can find the level that works for them. At the buffet they said everything was a 2 out of 5, and what I had didn't seem to have much heat to it at all.

While this may not be my favorite Indian restaurant in town, it is definitely on the list, especially if meeting up with a friend for lunch in that part of town or for a convenient meal before a movie at AMC."}
{"text":"Very good Indian restaurant. We went today for dinner, although I have heard great things about lunch buffet too. Many vegetarian and vegan options, plus lots of meat entrees too. Clean and spacious. Easy parking, in the same mall as a Barriques. We got 10% off our dinner bill when we paid with cash (this only applies to dinner). Staff was really friendly to my kids. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Easily the best Indian lunch buffet in town. Priced right at $8.95, chock-full of options, the thing I like most is they offer it every day of the week they're open... weekends too! The staff is simply lovely, and everything is labeled so incredibly well, that when I stumble across a dish I'm not familiar with, it's labeled above, often times described if it's a tad unknown. The salad to start is a pretty rad and refreshing way to begin, and from there it just gets better. My last trip they had coconut naan. COCONUT NAAN! Is this a thing everyone knows about but me? It was stellar, sort of salty, sort of sweet, simply lovely soaking up all my curries!"}
{"text":"Second time eating here! The first time was very memorable. The fish masala and palak paneer was incredibly delicious. They also had this amazing sweet naan that wasn't on the menu but my friend asked about it and they said they could do it for us. The garlic naan was also great. We had some leftovers, which was super delicious the next day too!

Today we went for the lunch buffet. The buffet area seemed smaller than other Indian buffet places we've been, but I think the area was just more condensed because they still had a lot of standard Indian buffet items. No palak paneer though. The curries were still good. The rice pudding was... ok... the rice was a bit harder. The mango lassi came and looked fancy and tasted pretty good. 

The place is clean and the people were nice there. :) The decor is also eclectic... 

You get a little bit of discount if you pay in cash."}
{"text":"Good food and good prices. They will even top up your doggie bag with more rice to sip up all that delicious sauce. If you go for the buffet, rest assured that the pans are regularly refilled so the food stays fresh. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We have eaten in a few Indian restaurants around the area and this particular one is the best we've had so far.  Staff is friendly and attentive.  Menu is extensive but we tried the lunch buffet for $8.95 and it was a steal!  Husband said mango ice cream was excellent.  I didn't have room to try any of the desserts.  ."}
{"text":"How do I start? This is the restaurant that made me love Indian cuisine. Their lunch buffets are a great deal if you want to try a little bit of everything. However I have to say that their tikka masala with fish (yes fish) is delicious! They do not use tilapia like most other places they use a different type of white meat fish that is firmer and tastier - my husband's favorite. Their shahikorma sauce is my favorite, creamy and delicious.

Let's not forget that the naan bread in this place is spectacular. I could order naan all day as it is served fresh out of the oven. Naan perfection. They offer unlimited rice so you don't have to worry about running out.


Overall the food is delicious and the service is good. The prices are also reasonable, thus it is a great place to enjoy with friends and family."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a young lady for a late lunch.  They had the lunch buffet which was perfect for both of us.  We had a variety of main dishes and were pleased to see both mean and vegetarian options.  Despite catching the end of the lunch buffet the food was delicious and not over done as some warmed food can get.  There were two types of naan and a couple different chutney's.  I'm glad there weren't a line of people at the buffet as the way it was organized didn't make for an easy line up for making a plate.  There were also a couple of dessert options as well as chicken soup.  
The server checked in on us during the meal even though we were just getting the buffet as we ordered a drink mid-way through the meal.  I was pleased that the price of the child buffet was based on the age as it was a good fit for what was eaten!  I will go back for an evening meal the next time I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is the perfect addition to our Fitchburg dining pallet. Authentic Indian quisine in a nicely finished space that offers a blend of charm, class and friendly service.  The vast selection of foods will tickle your taste buds in ways no other local establishment can.  Home made breads, cheeses, curries, desserts and lovely drinks are but a few of the delights here.  This is a vegetarian's haven from their home kitchen!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend coming here for their lunch buffet. It's not huge and the selection is kind of limited, but they make up for it with quality. 

The staff is awesome and even knows me at this point. They're always friendly, and are willing to go above and beyond to help you out. They're also super aware of what they're serving, so they can help me sort out my allergy needs. 

They always have a few traditional choices you'd expect like chicken Tikka masala and a vindaloo. They have pakoora, samosas, and a fried naan that is just spectacular. The food has never tasted old, and they're constantly refreshing things. They also check on how you're enjoying things, and will help with suggestions if you're looking to make it a bit spicier. Every Tuesday I have been there, Mushroom and Paneer Masala has been available, and I have to say it's the best I've had in Madison. 

$9.95 is a really great price for lunch, and you get a 10% discount if you pay cash."}
{"text":"Indian is my favorite type of cuisine and so I've tried every place I can find. Haveli is so far my favorite Indian restaurant in the Madison area. I've only had the occasion to visit a couple of times but they have been consistently excellent on both occasions. 

Both times it was for their lunch buffet and the selection was broad enough to allow me to try a lot of different things, the flavors were rich and well developed, the wait staff attentive but not in your face. All in all it was my ideal lunch experience.

My wife also enjoyed the fact that they didn't overdo it on the heat of the spices so that she could also try everything.

Their cost were on the low end of average for buffets in the area, as well, which certainly doesn't hurt.

I try not to eat at buffets often, when I do they are Indian, and for the foreseeable future all my visits are saved for these guys."}
{"text":"My gf and I ate there and each were completely hooked!  Their Coconut naan bread is among the top 5 tastiest things I've eaten in my life. Each of our meals were amazing, and we will definitely be back.  The only non-amazing thing was the Chai tea which tasted fairly non-signature of anything particular to me.  It could have been an off night, or maybe my lack of knowing what actual authentic Chai should taste like.  Either way, this doesn't take away from how great the food is."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!  We ordered the coconut naan as an appetizer and it came to the table piping hot. It was so good that I had difficulty not eating it all and filling up before our entrees arrived. For my entree I ordered the Lamb Masala, which arrived promptly. The portion of curry looked like it was going to be small but I actually had to take most of it home as it was deceivingly large.  Entrees were delicious.  The staff is very attentive and polite.  Most people can expect to spend about $20 a person for dinner.  I just moved to the neighborhood and this will be one of my regular dinner spots!"}
{"text":"I've had two dining experiences here.  My curry dish at both times have been very good.  Please note I don't eat very spicy so the flavors have been great for those of us  who like mild spice levels.  My dinner guest at my last visit got medium spice level and was satisfied with her choice too.

Service is very attentive.  Quick on refills and generous pours on wine.  Our server was happy to give suggestions and to explain menu items.  There is a small discount on cash payments so try to remember to hit an ATM before arriving.  

I've not made a buffet here but I hope to cue k it out in the near future."}
{"text":"Excellent food, attractively presented, and served by a polite, friendly, and attentive staff in a very pleasant room. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I've ever had! We ordered naan, Chicken Kabob, and Butter Chicken. Service was great, food was excellent and plentiful."}
{"text":"Very attentive service. Staff is so sweet! They truly want you to have a great experience. Food was excellent with generous portions naan bread better than average. Can't wait to try the buffet on Sunday. We will be back!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been, but the food was just all right. CTM was OK but nothing to write home about. Cheese naan was a joke. It was a yellow cheese and tasted as though they had simply made a grilled cheese but with naan instead of loaf bread."}
{"text":"Always friendly prompt service. I have dined in and taken out- they always get my order right. They cater to my vegan diet and the food is always very delicious! I would recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"There goat meat curry is the best I've had in US and service is excellent too. Five star rating well deserved. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to their lunch buffet very recently, the food is good and the service is pretty sweet. Not too outstanding wrt the food variety but the tastes would be super good considering the price. location is nice and it is a good fit for a work day lunch."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Indian food and find Haveli reliably friendly and tasty.  The lunch buffet today was outstanding, with excellent goat curry ... not on every menu.   Try Goa style or Madras style foods in the evening.  Inexpensive given the quality.   Pleasant wait staff.   Worth a detour."}
{"text":"Based on lunch buffet only. Very small buffet. Everything on my plate was lukewarm at best. There is no spice. Everything was bland or even sweet. The pork dish was the only thing with a little heat. Staff was friendly and attentive. The place was clean and nicely decorated. I will not return as I've had better. Try Haldi instead."}
{"text":"Haveli is hands down one of the best Indian restaurants in this area. Previously, I had only gotten take-out, but I was still super satisfied. I'm basic and I get Chicken Tikka Masala every time. The chicken is very good.

Anyway, the rave review is for my 4th of July trip to Haveli and actually sit there to have a meal.  The servers were the nicest people in the world. They were so kind and patient and made jokes, which I love. There were four of us, and only one of my friends ordered a mango lassi. Another server who did not take our order came to our table confused on who got it, so then he joked that we would just all take sips and pass it around. Maybe you had to be there, but I thought it was pretty funny.

It's deceptively a lot of full. I was super full afterwards. 

There's a discount if you pay in cash!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Madison. I love Indian food having grown up in the UK, where the ubiquitous nature of Indian restaurants is as Mexican or Italian is in the US. And by far some of the best Indian food is to be found. Friendly service, high quality ingredients - and I love that white meat chicken can be had for every sauced chicken dish - not sure why that's the exception rather than the rule in Madison and it's the norm in the UK rather than unidentifiable chicken parts - Having just moved to Fitchburg it's our go to place - now if only they had onion bhajis in the apps selection......"}
{"text":"I was in the area and didn't feel like driving to Swad or Dhaba. So decided to swing by the place given the rave reviews. 

It lived up to the hype with a good dal Tadka. The paneer masala chunks were a little too large in my opinion but that didn't take away from the flavor. 

I reached close to closing time but was given extremely fast service and pleasant service. They didn't try to rush me out or say that things weren't available. Worth a visit if you are in the area and craving Indian food."}
{"text":"Haveli has beautiful decorations. The service is prompt and friendly. The food is wonderful and has an excellent spice to it. I have already been back here at least seven times . Thank you for coming to my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"New place in Fitchburg  and I must say I am pretty excited for it. We ordered the coconut naan with shrimp korma. I the the food was really good the only complaint was the shrimp dish seemed a little overpriced at $13.95. I would probably give the food and service 4 stars but the price was just a little high off the menu. The lunch buffet said it was only $8.95 and that would be a steal if the rest of their food is as good. The buffet was open at night too but opted for the order off the menu. They even said I could get carry out buffet. Pricing for the buffet seem much more reasonable. 

Glad to have a seemingly good option for lunch in the Fitchburg area! I will update after I try it. Hopefully it's a four or five :)"}
{"text":"Great overall experience! The combination of ambiance, food and exceptional service made this from our first experience, a place we will return!"}
