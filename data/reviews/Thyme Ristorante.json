{"text":"Recently found this little gem on Lakeshore. Enjoyed friendly service and delicious food. Had the bruschetta with cheese, gnocchi bolognese (rich meat sauce with soft, pillowy bites of gnocchi), deluxe pizza (the crust is so good and they don't hold back on the toppings) and tiramisu (the server told us it's homemade down to the freshly ground beans for espresso). Couldn't finish it all and my mouth is watering just thinking about finishing the leftovers tomorrow. Will most definitely return, perhaps to try the eclectic and unexpected option of Thai food."}
{"text":"The waiters here are very attentive and are very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list. The food is fabulous and the decor is very quaint. I would recommend this place to try. I've brought my family members here who've enjoyed it as well. It was a very pleasant dining experience. Pasta and various sauces were good, and very delicious. From my personal experienece, I'd recommend the risotto and ending the meal with their homemade carmel crunch cake! It's amazing!"}
{"text":"FINALLY, somewhere good to eat in Port Credit where the food, the staff and the ambiance make for a truly great night out.  Our group had an appetizer of grilled goat cheese served on bed a wild greens along with raspberries, blueberries, pecans, orange slices and a complex balsamic vinaigrette.  We then had various main meals, such as the grilled lamb chops in a red wine reduction, lasagna, a fish special with grouper, and others.  Everyone was enchanted with the meal.  The service was attentive, the staff really knows what they're serving.  The desserts sounded exquisite, but everyone was too full to get to that stage.

Highly recommend this lovely restaurant."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to this restaurant. They have a great tomato sauce. Their dinner specials always feature a unique food item I've never tried before. Most recently I had bumble bee (yellow and black) fettuccini in a cream sauce with seafood and it was terrific. The atmosphere is warm. Randy, their server is always welcoming, knowledgable and accommodating. They have a decent wine selection and food prices are reasonable. I do recommend making reservations as this place is popular."}
{"text":"went to this place tonight with my husband for the first time. both the food was delicious. I had the seafood soup to start and a seafood special . service provided by Randy was amazing. its a cozy little restaurant a true jewel in port credit."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Lori and Deborah was amazing servers. The bruchetta was so fresh and delicious (got with cheese.). The nocci was sublime. Pizza deluxe was crispy and topping were amazing! Everything is done fresh in the restaurant.  Do get the tiramessu,  you'll love it. They do have free WiFi"}
{"text":"At Thyme and can't tell you how disappointing. We have sat here for 90 minutes and no entree yet!  If you are going to eat here come 2 hrs before you plan to eat!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, really authentic Italian pasta. I got the pesto pasta (I forgot the actual name) and it was amazing! One thing is that many of their dishes are served with a wine sauce and it proved difficult finding something I could eat (since I can't consume alcohol). Other than that though, friendly staff (food took a while to come though), great food, will be returning!"}
{"text":"I've frequented this restaurant between 2011-2012 so I'm basing it on the 3 times I've been there I haven't been there this year....yet.

I usually only go out to this restaurant when I'm out in Mississauga visiting with my aunt and uncle (who first put me onto this place).  They themselves have been going here for years, so I'm also surprised that there are not many great and objective reviews of this place.  

First impressions this place is very laid back in its design think little Italy meets sopranos, its a little cluttered with decorations as some have said but thats part of the charm.   This is no pretentious Italian restaurant, this is more like an Italian family eatery kind of place.

If Randy (the comical waiter) is still there, ask for him cause he is amazing guy and quite a sideshow himself, a real people person that will put a smile on your face by the end of night.

It was dinner time so I had the Fusilli al Salmon, but I'm not a big marinara guy which was what the dish had.  So I asked if it be possible to switch the sauce for a white wine pesto like one of the other dishes, they didn't bat an eye and said sure no problem.   I find a lot of pseudo \"Italian\" places the marinara has too much acidity, its like they don't know how to cook it or use the correct ingredients.   And I didn't want to bother with an acidic pasta dish tonight...and plus didn't expect much from this place upon first impressions.  

I'm a lover of Italian food although I'm Asian, hey both cultures know their noodles/pasta.   Anyways first time I'm trying this and it was the best bowl of pesto Fusilli i've ever had....hands down.    Without blowing my own horn (but will =D ) I think I have a very good sense for taste and smell...partly why I like eating a lot lol.

This pesto wasn't some canned or add water sauce plus people who do shoddy cooking don't make something this pure tasting.  When you eat something memorable it sticks in your mind, and to some you can almost taste it.   This was something memorable and why I came back twice more in the following year....and Mississauga is out of my way so I don't frequent it as much.

The second time i dined there again with my aunt and uncle we met the owner cause I just had to give my complements to the chef after my meal who was the owner as well.  

Guess what the owner is Thai guy (looks in his 40s)...and I was like you make these Italian dishes?  He was like yeah, I've been around to many Italian restaurants and he said he could do a lot better than most of them out there so he opened this place.  No kidding.   I said do you know how tough it is to find a good Italian restaurant that makes good honest Italian dishes that don't break the bank.

The third time was no different I was impressed with this restaurant.  I've been to joints like Grazie on Yonge & Eg , this place runs circles around that joint that supposedly makes homemade pasta.

Granted I haven't been to other higher end Italian restaurants like Teroni or such, but having a neighborhood eatery where you can go and enjoy an Italian meal without breaking the bank on any day of the week is special.   And you'll enjoy it too, which is the most important part.  

Just like a lot of the small successful hipster joints (some I've reviewed) there is a reason a medium sized restaurant like this in a strip plaza has lasted so long without going out of business.  Good food, good service, great price and from that a loyal customer base.  So you know what forget these people that complain about the restaurants they've tried, people like to hear themselves complain all the time. 

Don't take my word for it either, make your own decision and try it out.  Cause like any business maybe they have a backup chef in training or someone is sick or they didn't get the best ingredients that week.   I always make it point to try a place out twice... cause life happens.   You had one bad dining experience...what do most American Italian movies say....Furgetaboutit"}
{"text":"The best server.  Best food. Great evening. Food came in a good amount of time. Very happy!!"}
{"text":"We really wanted some solid Italian food and this place didn't deliver. We ordered the gorgonzola gnocchi and lasagna. The gnocchi were SO salty that I literally got heart palpitations after a few bites. Seriously it was hardly edible. I wiped each gnocchi on the side of my plate before putting it in my mouth. The lasagna was bland. It tasted like the microwave lasagna I used to buy as a student. I guess there was some meat in it, but it was pretty insignificant and tasteless. We got some bread, which was welcome as the wait for the food was longer than usual, but it was  sort of pastry-like. I know we should have complained, but seriously, even if they offered bringing us something else, it would have been a long wait as it took forever just to get the orders taken etc. The prices on the menu are slightly higher than shown on the website, and the Thai options (which aren't on their website at all) are quite random. 

I should mention that the server ladies were lovely and kind. It's too bad about the food."}
{"text":"I had been craving pizza all day and was hoping to get some great tasting pizza; I ordered the Pizza Margherita and found it extremely sweet. I was disappointed to find one of my favourite pizzas ruined as if the crust was loaded with sugar and made from a pizza pocket recipe. It made me feel bloated and gassy after one slice of pizza and I couldn't even enjoy the gnocchi I bought. I do not recommend eating here at all."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Great food, and are willing to do take away or delivery. The wait staff is amazing!  They know the specials and provide fantastic recommendations. We had seafood ravioli, based on the recommendation, it was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely fabulous! With an extensive wine listing to impeccable customer service, and fantastic food, I give this restaurant the rating it deserves. The food is moderately priced. This spot is very good for a quiet first date or an intimate anniversary dinner. It's classy, simple and the atmosphere is relaxing. This is an Italian cuisine restaurant that offers a variety of pasta, pizza and wine. The food is great, the servers are amazingly friendly and informative - they know be wine menu from top to bottom, same with the food menu. The price range for dinner is between $13-25 per person. Wine is around $7-10/glass. This restaurant is worth it, go check it out!"}
{"text":"Really really good food. My only problem is with delivery. I ordered food one night from here and I live a 10 minute walk away however the food was here after an hour and 15 minutes or so. 

The pasta is always amazing and this would be 5 stars if the delivery was better."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!
I went with my boyfriend to celebrate our 7 years together. We ordered their Manicotti and Papardella featured pasta and they were both absolutely fantastic. The waitress named Brianne was soooo nice and polite to us...she was perfect! 
I recommend this place to anyways and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I was there on June 18, 2017 for father's day dinner yesterday. As usual the food and service was excellent. Normally I order the seafood pasta ... but the server recommended that I try lamb ... and that was yummy. Thank you for another great dinner. If you ever want to meet the owners ... just ask for Peter and Cindy."}
{"text":"Ordered: Cozze Riviera as appetizer, and Spaghetti Rose as entree.

Review: if you have \"thyme\" to spare as you're enjoying Port Credit, then definitely check out this cozy restaurant. As soon as you walk in you get the family style Italian vibe with nice decor and spacious seating. This restaurant offers a bit of everything, ranging from pastas, to pizza to risotto! I went with the pasta and the flavour was very nice and not too salty. It was a comfortable portion with plenty of toppings as described on their menu. They also offer complimentary garlic bread during dinner time fresh from their oven. If you're fortunate enough to be served by one of their male waiters then you're in for a treat as he is funny and enthusiastic! This place is great for a date or with family.

Interesting tidbit: this place has a small section dedicated to Thai cuisine! Took me by surprise as I read that on the menu but didn't try it (maybe next time)."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Thyme. It's a 10 minute walk from our house, and looks very cute from the outside what with it's hanging flowers, painted windows, and bunches of grapes hanging from the eaves. Alas, it was not to be.

We walked in early on a Friday evening, and were greeted by a very friendly hostess. The restaurant straddles two units in a typical strip mall. The first one had open windows, and a walk-out to a small patio. It was nice and breezy, The hostess asked us if we had a reservation, and we said no (reservation? it was 6:00pm in Mississauga), and were shown into the other unit, which was a good bit smaller and a whole lot more stuffy. Anyway, we sat at the table and had a look around.

The decorator had the best of intentions - nice, neutral, faux-finished walls with the occasional painting or piece of sculpture, but the whole place felt cluttered. Table dressings weren't clean.

My wife and I split a seafood soup, caprese salad, and lobster ravioli. The seafood soup was lame, the caprese salad had lettuce on it and the ravioli was awful. It came straight from a Costco package, and was rich and goopy. Long story short, stay away."}
{"text":"This is my all time fav place for organic and delicious fresh food. We order their pizza and/or Pad Thai for delivery at least once a week. We've gone and sat the restaurant a few times and would recommend the mushroom risotto, their signature salad with the goat cheese, their pizzas, and their pad thai. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"This place is fast becoming my Port Credit stand-by.  

Excellent food, and the kitchen seems to be able to accommodate your every whim.  The menu includes a large selection of Thai food (I guess just in case you're not in the mood for Italian food at an Italian restaurant?!).   

Super friendly and engaged staff will have you leaving with warm fuzzy feelings.  It's like one of those Olive Garden commercials but with real humans!
  
Slightly cheesy but passable decor, but let's not forget that we're talking about an independent restaurant in suburban strip mall here.   Still though, it has a cozy and comfortable atmosphere that makes it easy to become a regular."}
{"text":"I went to Thyme to celebrate a birthday dinner last night. Wasn't sure what to expect - especially after reading the reviews - but it was great. There was a group of 9 and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. They did nice extras for me as the birthday girl too. :) The appetizers came out quick but the entrees do take a while. BUT they do tell you in advance that each dish is hand made. The sauce on the Fusilli Vodka certainly tasted handmade and it was delicious. I will order it again. While you are waiting the wait staff make sure you have enough to drink and keep checking in with you. Thanks to Randy and the other wait staff for a very nice time."}
{"text":"This tucked in Italian restaurant in Port Credit certainly doesn't get enough attention. Perhaps because from the outside it looks completely the opposite of Italian, in my opinion. For a year I drove by this place and thought it was a cafè. 

Their wine menu is pretty slack considering it's the nectar of the Italian Gods  but their vast food menu makes up for it. They can make pretty much any pasta you can conjure up. 

The food is really tasty and most times the chef will come out with the food and explain with pride what he has created for you, which I respect. 

The prices are totally reasonable. You wit break the bank here. 

The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the large chunks of red onion in my Spaghetti Giardinere still had the skin on them.. Kind of a turn off. But that's pretty minor, you should absolutely still give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had our monthly dinner at Thyme recently.

A couple of things stand out from the restaurant:
* We were amazed by the size of the menu. Many pasta options, as well as a surprising Thai section. Additionally, there were 4 or 5 specials of the day.
* The service from Randy, the very well known server, was exceptional. Truly a different kind of service. However, sometimes it is way more than you need. There is a balance.
* The basket of focaccia =  yum!
* Desserts were delicious.

My only negatives were:
* The \"world famous salad\" wasn't that great. Not too sure what is famous about it.
* Was hoping for a larger portion of pasta.

Though, overall, a very delicious meal. We will return to further explore the menu."}
{"text":"There's really nothing bad I can say about this place. I've been going here for years. The food is amazing. The service is always great and if you get Randy as your server then you're in for a treat!Awesome guy. Their selection of food is great, interior decorations are classy and seating is comfortable. Food is quick to come out and always tastes fresh. Good wine selection and drinks too, as well as desserts. So good. A hidden gem located beside a convenience store but once you walk in, you're in a different world! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas on skip the dishes the other night and was very impressed! As a big fan veggies I love the wide selection available. I loved everything about the pizza especially the crust! 10/1 would recommend"}
