{"text":"First time customer. This place is right down the street from my work so I figured I would check it out.  I asked for their anniversary sub special, which is turkey, ham and cheese. I asked for them to leave the ham off the sub (not I big deal right?!?) The girl taking my order says well that's a different sub all together. Really, you can't just leave the ham off?! After going back and forth a few times I told her I would just take the damn ham off! Unbelievable! This place is way overpriced for what you get and the food is not even all that. The staff blew me away at how rude they were! Not a good experience and I definitely will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Old is right. This place should close. I've tried this place several times over the last several years and every time I have been disappointed. I'm not sure why I'm so lucky but 3 times I have found HAIR in my sandwich YUCK. Let's just say that ended my lunch.  They definitely need hair nets on the workers. Blech!  Next time I'm calling the Health Dept!"}
{"text":"This place is hairy.  About a year ago, I was mortified when the tuna sandwich I had almost completely consumed had a dark hair attached to it. I kindly went up to the counter to express my dismay and the manager asked me if I wanted \"credit for next time\"? Um, I don't think there will be a next time. I kindly asked for my money back which they did, reluctantly.   About a week ago, I decided to give them another chance. Hey, hair happens and they have really good salads. So I went and would you believe it? There was ANOTHER HAIR stuck to the hard-boiled egg in my salad!!! Lightning never strikes twice but apparently hair does, at least at this place.   I called right away because I just could not believe it had HAPPENED AGAIN. This time they offered to make me a \"new\" salad and quickly ended the call. I came back for the salad, although I didn't even want it at this point. The manager was no where to be found when I returned. I will never go back to Old Station which is unfortunate because other than the hair, their menu was good."}
{"text":"Not the best subs I ever had, but definitely a satisfying and quick lunch! I had a veggie sub (extra cheese) which I have eaten before and it is delish every time! There is something about thinly shredded lettuce and mayo that when combined, it is like the force. I also had the cheddar and broccoli soup which is creamy and not over-doing it like I have experienced time and again with that flavor of soup. I don't usually drink  a lot of soda, but when I do, ice is super important and they have this slushed ice that makes the soda so worth the extra calorie and sugar intake! I am occupied by all the antique NFL memorabilia while waiting for my order and the staff is super friendly! If you are in the area and need a bite to eat, stop in, it is worth it."}
{"text":"I went to the Sub Shop today for lunch. I split the chicken salad sandwich with my friend.  The bread was hard and tasted not fresh and didn't have very much chicken.  We told the owner she said that's how they received the bread when they received the order, but besides that the sandwich was perfect. So she was aware of the bread being hard, but was still selling it??? She offered to give us a discount on our next order, ok so why not give us the discount immediately.  My friend and I definitely were not satisfied with the service or sandwich."}
{"text":"Small little place to eat near the Capitol.  I would never had tried this if a friend hadn't suggested it.  So glad she did.  She LOVES the veggie sub but I got the tuna as a wrap. You can make any sandwich a sub.  Great for vegetarians too!!!!  Not bad but great place to grab a quick bite.  You might see some colorful people outside since it's downtown and a lot of ghetto around, but try it!"}
{"text":"I love this cute little joint! Try the meatball it's the best I've ever had but don't take it to go because it will get soggy eat it there! Italian is good too! The have the best Ice it is shaved and that may not matter but I am an ice snob because I always eat my ice :)"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times to eat.   Rough neighborhood with lot's of homeless hanging around, make sure your doors are locked.   Food is average and pricey for a place like this.   Service is okay, but can be very overwhelmed during lunch rush..     Not a bad place, just don't go in with too many expectations..."}
{"text":"Absolutely Rude! Called in to place an order to be delivered. Called 1.5 hr. ahead. She sounded like an older woman...Wow! So rude, I can't believe it. Curt, short, did not want to answer my questions, seemed completely annoyed that I was calling at all. Everyone in our party of 8 agreed that the sandwiches were just okay. One persons sub roll was seriously hard on each end. I was told not only once, but twice on the phone and I quote \"I don't want to be getting any random phone calls saying something is wrong\" I gave one star for the convenience, however, not convenient enough for me to be a repeat customer. Also one star for the deliver guy, who was very nice."}
{"text":"Really I'm the first to review this place that has been here for a gajillion years?? So I should preface by saying the few blocks surrounding the area are the oldest graves in Phoenix, a pioneer site.    I love this place, too bad it does not love to provide service.  I was attending a conference at Civic Plaza and my hostess was buying.. I scanned Yelp as I had no idea what I wanted to eat and than it hit me..Tuna Wrap with the Zombies in the graveyard!  Too bad when I walked in I requested a bag of sour cream chips be added to my tuna wrap - the cashier looked at me like I was doing crack and refused my request and the sandwich maker asked what was up so I made the request a second time when he refused I asked what the big deal was?  He said because doing so would be a, \"Pain in his ass\" So I said Okay, as a customer it is a pain in my ass to spend my money here.  and left.  My $$$ spends any where and as long as I'm not making unreasonable demands or asking for free well than I worked customer service long enough to know making people happy keeps them coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop for lunch in Phoenix. If you are in a hurry you can quickly get your order to -go, but if you have time I would recommend enjoying the atmosphere to escape the surrounding concrete jungle for an hour. The restaurant used to be an old gas station, and there is a lot of cool historical pieces adorning the walls. The sandwiches are far better than any freaky bread/meat you would get at Subway, and the veggies are always very fresh and the rolls are to die for. I would also highly recommend getting a dessert pastry like the rice krispy treats. They sell out fast and I usually take a few back with me to the office to cheer up my coworker or brown nose my boss ;)"}
{"text":"A joke. Absolute joke. The bread they use is on par with Wonder Bread. Not much meat. Mayo was warm and that makes me gag, nothing worst in the world than WARM MAYO, cool it down.   Seriously though not very good. If I was starving and this was the only option I have I'd start biting on my fingernails to hold me over instead of subjecting myself to the worst sandwich spot in the United States.  Pretty sure the lettuce on mine was from a Costco party mix common at family functions.   1/5"}
{"text":"I travel all the way across town when I get a hankering for this high quality grub!! I love their daily specials and all those old license plates on the walls are cool. I LOVE THE potato salad, and I usually dont like potato salad!! Crazy!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually get the Italian (sometimes half instead of whole) with a drink and Cole slaw. It's really yummy. Definitely more meat in a sub than I'm used to and the vinegar with oil is a great mix with the meats."}
{"text":"Best sub place in town.  Nothing else to be said besides that bold statement."}
{"text":"First time visiting the sandwich. Sandwich was ok considering the tomatoes could have been fresher.  Upon my last bite, I found a tiny baby roach crawling in my wrapper. I will never return."}
{"text":"Met Hubby here today for one of our last lunches together for the summer. It's the place he (and just about every other state employee, it seems) eats most often. It's a tiny little shop with a few tables crammed in and a mistered patio out back. The walls are lined with AZ memorabilia, license plates, and old timey signs. But for once, they're for real, not the fake old timey stuff that's on the walls of most chain restaurants. I'm lookin' at you, Cracker Barrel....  They have a great variety of subs, plus soups, salads, fruit bowls, a veritable wall o'chips, and baskets of sweet snax. Get the Rice Krispie treat. You know you wanna. The subs were quite good- and huge. Had I known how big, I would absolutely have ordered a half. Tons of fresh veggies, lite on the mayo, a tad heavy on the dressing. Dallas is right- the ice is awesome. It's the perfect crush, so that, according to my husband, he can keep on chewing it long after he gets back to his desk and NOT annoy the crap out of his fellow cubies."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and still going as I work nearby.  I typically order by phone and pick up.  For sandwiches, I substitute the wrap for the sub bread. I love the avocado chicken/tuna salad. Fresh fruit is provided in the salad. The ingredients are fresh. The daily specials are great. The chicken noodle soup has increased in quality from previous years. It is higher priced than the fast food; however, the quality and freshness is great."}
{"text":"A tiny, old gas station turned sandwich shop that sits right next to Pioneer Memorial Park & Cemetery is a hot-spot for near-by state gov workers and Capitol lurkers. After doing a quick Google search of Old Station, I came across a short piece from the New Times about the history of this needle-in-a-haystack.  The building sat on Jefferson Street since 1926, beginning its life as a Mobile gas station and includes the best display of historic Arizona license plates in the state.  While you wait for your sandwich, look at the front wall and check out the array of AZ license plates dating back to 1912!  Pretty cool.    Oh, and the subs are pretty darn good too. There are approximately 30 sub variations, along with daily soup specials, fruit bowls, chips and the much beloved Rice Krispy Treats!  There is a nice outdoor patio in the back and a sufficient number of tables inside, which is surprising based on the small square footage of the place. Lunch time is busy, but the staff keep things moving and always with a smile.  They also serve breakfast -- burritos and subs. Check it out sometime; you'll get some good eats and a great sense of history in a town where history is sometimes lacking."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, because this is the only decent eatery for government employees in that area. But I am still not warmed up to its subs after 8 months. I like the Chicken Wild Rice Soup (Wed only) though."}
{"text":"If only the food were as good as the atmosphere.  This place has tons of character. It's small but lively. The staff is really friendly as well and that's always a plus. Problem is that the subs are nothing special. They taste like anything I could make at home in 5 minutes or less.  When I end up going I feel like there is way too much bread like one of those pre made grocery store subs. Also the prices are high. It's really close to work but honestly the DES building down the street has a cafeteria that does subs on Thursdays. Quality is the same, DES portions are about 50% bigger and with chips and drink it's still about half the price."}
{"text":"Always a great place for a wrap or sand which downtown! Chicken salad is amazing! Oil & vinegar on anything & the bread is so good!"}
{"text":"This place is so freaking good. I've only ever ordered one item and that's the veggie sub. Maybe sometime I'll try the cheese one but if it ain't broke... The mayo is the best I've ever had. I love their ice. Great ice.   The patio is misted. The decor is fun. Totally worth the drive if you're in a 7.5 mile range."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch pretty much once a week because it is convenient to my workplace. If you work in downtown Phoenix, particularly in the area around the capitol and have not stopped here for lunch you are missing out! This is not a fancy place with balsamic bars or 14 kinds of mustard. It is a pretty no frills quick lunch but the sandwiches are great. It gets busy at noon time so I go earlier, around 10:45 to 11 and rarely wait more than 3 to 5 minutes to order. There is a daily special and a soup of the day. The soups are hearty and delicious. They also make sun tea which makes this southern girl smile!  If you are looking for a simple, quick lunch for about $9 this is a great option."}
{"text":"It takes somthing special to make a good veggie sub, most places jut take a normal sub and throw away the meat, and some times if you are lucky add an avacado.  This was the case here. Just some lettuce pickle tomato and cheese.   The Bread and cheese were decent but overall the sandwitch lacked any insperation, sprouts, a pesto, grilled portobello etc would have been nice ways to add some flavor and substance, alas, my quick meal selection left me disappointing and hungry and the price was aceeptable at ~$6 but not great."}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey and cheese sub on a whole wheat sub bun with the works.  It was nice and fresh at a reasonable price.  I would have liked some onions though."}
{"text":"I really enjoy The Old Station!  The subs are tasty and filling and reasonably priced, and I have not yet found one I don't like.  The soups are excellent!  My favorite is the home made tomato soup, but their clam chowder is awesome as well.  A far cry better than the &^&* they serve in the DES cafeteria!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  I work near the Capitol, and it's my favorite place to grab a quick lunch.  They work quickly, their ingredients are always fresh and they pack my half sub full of goodness. The staff is kind, and though there is limited seating inside, there is plenty of seating outside if you don't mind the weather. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I only wish the indoor dining area was bigger. Fast service, tasty food, affordable experience."}
{"text":"Been to the Old Station many times and always get the same thing (Hot Pastrami and Cheese). As the photos show, it may not ever look the best but it is a quality tasting sub. The lunch staff does a good job and pumping out the lunch orders and keeps things moving. Overall, this joint will not blow your mind but will leave you satisfied with your lunch."}
{"text":"I'd have to agree with most the people here to say it's very average. I got a turkey sub which was fine. I definitely could have made a sandwich at home that was better but this is close to work so it's convenient. Gets really busy and there isn't a lot of seating inside."}
{"text":"Pretty solid sub shop located close to the State Capitol.  The area is pretty sparse on food establishments; I am sure you could get something a little more refined downtown...but why deal with the parking and people?  I ordered the Italian sub and I would definitely recommend! The combination of quality meat and cheese was the highlight.  The portion would feed a very hungry person! The Italian dressing was also very good with a sweet yet herb-y kick.  The only negative was the roma tomatoes were under-ripe and cut too thick.  Potato salad side was average...next time I'll just pick out something from the vast assortment of chips."}
{"text":"This is an amazing veggie sub -- the only item I've had here because I am so in love with it! Whenever I am in this area (always job-related) this is my #1 lunch stop. In the interim, I'll dream of my favorite sub sandwich from many miles away!!"}
{"text":"The place could use a cleaning of not only the restaurant, but staff as well. Made a visit for the first time, which is also our last. The gentleman behind the counter was attempting to take our order, but had two ladies in the back yelling at him for various reasons. We placed our order, and were interrupted prior to completing the 2 order by one of the ladies. She staring yelling at the guy to send our order back. He ignored them and proceeded with the 2nd half of our order. The lady comes to the counter to try to take the first order, which he explained we were not done.  After completing the order, the other lady yelled that they could be almost done making our food if he had sent it back.  No one in there had a pleasant attitude. If you have drama handle it else where.  All in all the food tasted just like the place looked and the lack of customer service or professionalism left it unappealing."}
{"text":"Stopped in after my internship The exterior is cute and quaint  It looks as if it has been there for quite some time Inside looks pretty much the same The menu is small but you're sure to find something to eat I got the daily special which was an Italian sanny The meat, cheese, oil and vinegar were all really good The bread was also very good I really enjoyed the sandwich, which came with mac salad and a soda I was surprised by the O.S.S.S and I will be going back to try the other meal options The workers were very nice and quick"}
{"text":"Iceberg lettuce!  Iceberg lettuce!  Really!?  They need to consider upgrading to finer vegetation.  And to make the sandwich worse, the tuna fish was swimming in mayonnaise.  WTF is this $hit?"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sandwich shops in Phoenix. The decor is very eclectic. Customer service is great. I only gave 4 starts because they are not open on the weekends."}
{"text":"My first time here. Very small place and very crowded at noon. A good sign. It looked like most folks were ordering \"to go.\" I would say go early, if you are going to try this little shop. When we finished eating I was barely out of my seat before someone else was sitting in it. I felt like our spirit auras were going to collide.    I had the chicken salad sub. The chicken in the salad was in large enough pieces that you could tell it was CHICKEN.; Some chicken salads are so finely chopped you sometimes wonder. but not here.  My dining companion had the special - roast beast and cheese sub. Must have been a good beast, because he ate it all; along with a cup of the chicken tortilla soup.    We then polished off two reasonably good choco-chip cookies.   Food was good; not gourmet, but good. Best part was the service. Friendly and fast. They do know what they are doing with the products they have to work with.   Would I go back? Probably, if I'm ever in that neck of the woods again . . . but only before or after the lunch hour. Why? Well, because everyone else within a two-mile radius was there from 12-1."}
{"text":"The food here is SOOOOOOO much better than the nearby State cafeteria.  In fact, the cafeteria failed inspection a bunch of times until it finally was closed for a few days last year to clean up.   Old Station lunch is decent and filling; about equivalent to Subway. I don't get all the rave reviews. I've worked near the capitol for over ten years and only choose Old Station if I'm very hungry and don't feel like driving."}
{"text":"I work at the Capitol so this place is not too far.  Co-worker and I came to this place to give them a try.    The location was small but clean.  Very well decorated.  The workers were fast, friendly, and kind.    I ordered a half of a chicken salad sub, and a strawberry watermelon fruit cut.  Both was amazing and delicious.  Decent quality and decent price.    Overall excellent experience, will definitely be back someday!"}
{"text":"Really the only spot in the area, but that doesn't take away from the quality.  Get the daily special and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Old Station is a really solid choice for sandwiches - and we are sandwich snobs.  There is a reason this place has been open for so many years.  They have simple, good quality consistent sandwiches at a great price.  This is a colorful, local and fun place with great food.  What's not to love here?  We always receive excellent service."}
{"text":"We placed an order thinking we were getting pickles.  Something as silly as a pickle would be an easy fix. Whenni called and talked to the manager she was extremely rude and started to chew me out. Apparently we have to say pickle on side to get the pickle on side that comes with the meal. Ok. But then she continues to read each order as if i am an idiot. I explained we are large company we had a small order 58 bucks but expect to be treated better. Then while handing out lunches. random, two meals had pickles. Explain that. And the one person doesnt even like pickles. Customer service fail. All aside you food cant make up for a crap service. Guess where we wont go again."}
{"text":"$6.01 bought me a **d e l i c i o u s**  foot long tukey sandwich, a bag of chips and a soda, it was the daily special.   CHEAP EATS!"}
{"text":"Family-owned and operated, quality ingredients (dynamite bread), fast friendly service, cool location... You can't go wrong here and I will most certainly return."}
{"text":"lots of subs to pick from, friendly staff, place is packed during lunch from all the government office around it"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! They have the best subs in town. I would definitely recommend the meatball sub or the pastrami Ruben. They also have refreshing salads that are great in this HOT Arizona summers and they delish daily soups. It gets super packed during lunchtime so I would recommend calling in an order and picking it up if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Anyone who is in the know, knows to get their orders to go!   Their subs, soups and fresh bowls of fruit (especially in the summertime) are wonderful.  You can never go wrong with the Daily Special!  You will definitely want to call your order in and pick it up to go because there isn't much seating in their dining room - especially around Noon on weekdays.  They have a shaded and covered outside eating area, as well as a couple picnic tables. They have a walk-up window to pick up called in orders, otherwise you head inside to order when you are ready.   Their soups, especially their cheesy potato, broccoli cheese and chicken noodle, are very hearty and good.  Their subs are very filling on fresh, baked bread with fresh meat and cheeses.  All subs are 10-inches and made to order.    Want their daily specials faxed to your office?  Just ask them to put you on their Morning Fax list!  You'll receive faxes daily, M-F, before 8:00am. Plenty of time before lunch to plan your order!  This is the most jam-packed and busy deli downtown!!  You will see all sorts of customers from state employees to government officials to sports figures to families and to firemen/paramedics and even schools on field trips!"}
{"text":"It's ok for the $.... But nothing to rave about!  I make a better sub sandwich at home... And the \"fresh\" fruit cup is never fresh!  Ugh I hate a dirty looking crew too!  Employees need to clean up"}
{"text":"So many things wrong with this place it boggles the mind.  1) The place is disgusting. 2) They have old toilets in the parking lot, garbage everywhere, the place is filthy. 3) There is a shanty town of homeless people right next door with several just kind of laying around out front.  4) Their sourdough bread is literally just taken from a bag like you get at a supermarket which causes you to put your fingers through it after they soak it with mayo. 5) The staff while friendly is also pretty bad looking. No hairnets, people are all tattooed up like they just got out of prison.  6) I bought 3 sandwiches and 3 bags of chips, it was over 25.00 - lol what? 7) There is almost no parking because the owners can't be bothered to put in parking lines. 8) Their website has no online ordering and looks like it was created in 1996 and hosted with GeoCities.   I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this hole."}
