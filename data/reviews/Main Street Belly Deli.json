{"text":"Homer doesn't have a lot to offer in terms of variety for anything.  1 Gas station, 1 grocery store (kind of), 1 bank... you get the idea.  When they got a 2nd business offering food, that was a pretty big deal!  When I found out that this business sells tons of awesome soda, great sandwiches, super yummy ice cream (Mackinaw Island Fudge is Awesome), and now micro brewery beer, I couldn't believe it was in Homer!!
  
Whether you want to pick up a mix and match 6 pack of soda or beer, get some food, play their old-school video games, browse their antiques, or order a latte, the Belly Deli is the place to be (well, lets face it, there isn't anywhere else to be in Homer anyway...)

You don't find a place like this in most small towns, so take a few minutes to stop in."}
{"text":"I had hoped to check out the Belly Deli after visiting the Homer Soda Festival last year, but never got around to it.  I finally had the chance today.  While the menu is small, the sandwiches are packed with ingredients and feature Boar's Head meats (YUM).  I had the Marilyn Monroe (turkey & bacon), minus the avocado.  My SO had the Cary Grant (chicken breast) on sourdough since they were out of the usual ciabatta bread.  Each sandwich was served with an ice cold pickle slice.  I really appreciated the cream cheese spread on my sandwich...it's not something you normally see and I usually forget about it when I'm making sandwiches at home.  The seating was minimal but was enough for the space.  Anyway, the sandwiches were huge and very filling, and our bill was just over $18 for two sandwiches and two bottles of soda, which was very reasonable.  We made sure to stock up on some bottles of soda for the road.  My SO was drawn to the old-school arcade games at the front of the building as well.  They also serve ice cream, but we were so stuffed from lunch that we skipped it.  We'll be back, hopefully before another year passes!"}
{"text":"After a long hike on the trails at Homer Lake, we were looking for a cool drink and something to eat.  We found the Deli Belly in Homer!  What a fabulous place.  One wall is almost completly lined with sodas! The vintage decorations and vibe reminded me of my youth when we lived in an apartment above a soda shop in a small town in Wisconsin while dad was serving in Vietnam.  We ordered sandwiches named after rat pack era stars like  Sammy Davis, The Sinatra, Marylynn Monroe and Dean Martin.  The sandwiches were fabulous. Big stacks of deli meat on fresh bread and a vintage soda...we loved it.  Next time I will be sure to have a banana split at their ice cream bar!"}
{"text":"This place is a wonderfully surprising gem!  They offer made to order sandwiches and coffees. But sodas are their specialty. Over 300 selections in glass bottles. Most are cold, and can be purchased by the bottle or by a mix and match 6 pack. 

They sponsor an annual Homer Soda Company festival that draws 15,000 people. 

Anyway, nice surprise and an awesome pit stop just off of I74."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Delicious sandwiches delicious hard dip ice cream all the sofa you could want."}
{"text":"Awesome pace for lunch or dinner.

We love this place.

Eat here often and bring guests here.

Come to Homer, Illinois and meet Carla and Lilo, great ladies."}
{"text":"The good: Nice place, clean, a lot to offer in a small which you don't often see. Quality ingredients for the sandwiches and I expect the ice cream is good too! 

The bad: None of the staff greet you as you walk in the door. They gaze at you and look away. I don't know where to order- do I order a sandwich by the deli case, ice created by the cooler, I don't know because the employees don't tell me (did I miss the order here sign?) So I order my sandwich from a young lady, the gentleman behind the deli case keeps filling condiment bottles as if I hadn't just ordered a sandwich and it wasn't noon. He doesn't take action on the sandwich until she walks 10 feet to give him the order. 2 more minutes to put everything away and now, the sandwich, yes! I don't know what's going on but this young man is putting this sandwich together like he is diffusing a bomb. It took 10 minutes to make- and when some one wants it to go, chances are they need to go...soon. He then tags it and bags it, throws my pickle in and walks all the way out to me to deliver it- could have yelled a name if I had been asked to give that, given a number, something - anything to speed up the process. I'm sure these kids are great, i just think they need some training on customer service. I certainly hope the deli is here for man years to come. With a few tweaks and very little additional investment, I think it could be great!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal, it's an automatic 5 stars because there is no place else that has hundreds of sodas for sale.  That in and of itself is worth the trip.  What you want to do is get a 6 pack (or two) to save a few bucks and have a few different bottles to take home with you and try, so you can even begin to figure out what you like or don't like.  (Or go to the festival and try them all, if you can handle even 50 at a time)

As far as the Deli part, they have Boar's Head which is your top of the line meats. The sandwiches seem on the pricey side but you're getting what you pay for, this isn't Subway.  The pickles are a nice touch.  If I remember right they even cut the sandwich through the paper like a real deli.  Think there is also ice cream and even wine and/or beer now.

2 bonus points added for the retro arcade games at the front of the store for the kiddies to play.  0.5 bonus points subtracted coz the old Homer Soda Fest merch was too high last time I was in.  Need to lower that down, shot glasses with a date on them have to be cheap. The only people buying those are the super fans and you gotta keep the super fans happy.

All in all this is a 5-star top choice anytime I'm passing through the area and want a NICE meal."}
{"text":"We were driving home from roadtrip and happened to randomly find this place while driving through Homer, a town of 700 people. This place was a great surprise, a huge wall of sodas, half in refrigerators, a deli with sandwiches and coffee including espresso. 

If you buy 6 sodas you get for price of 5. So we got 2 cold and 4 to take home. So many flavors to choose from! We also got 2 sandwiches named after old movie stars - The Cary Grant (chicken) and a special I can't remember name which had salami, olives, pepperoncini among other things.

Sandwiches were solid, service was friendly. We got there at 5pm on a Sunday, they close at 6pm so there weren't many ppl there so it was nice to chat to the girl behind counter and hear about Homer.

If you happen to be driving through Homer, this is a worthwhile stop!"}
{"text":"A neat little shop with great deli sandwiches and a huge selection of sodas. Definitely worth the trip to try something new outside of the CU area"}
