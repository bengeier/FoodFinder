{"text":"I have been here several times but this is my last time. Every time the wait is 30-45mins even if its the daily specials like 1 sandwich or 3 pieces of chicken. Waste of time."}
{"text":"If there was 0 stars I would have put that.  I don't usually write yelp reviews but this was definitely well deserved.  First, lets start with the cashier, who has no idea what she is doing. Threw my reciept in the garbage, gave me another one with a completely different order. Over charged by buddy, refunded it, then over charged him again. Thats just the start.  Who runs out of coke at lunch? The chicken definitley tasted \"off.\" But I thought it was the seasoning. But ohhhhh boy was I wrong! Be warned, if you watn to eat at this place, jsut set aside a couple hours and a few rolls of triple ply, and thank me later for the heads up.  They are ripping off popeyes and customers. Never going back."}
{"text":"Their hours seem to constantly be changing. I ordered a meal from them by delivery once and after an hour I called them again for the status of the food and they had closed. Didn't mention when they took my order that they'd be closing before I'd get the food delivered."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 chicken combo to-go but they only gave me 2 chickens instead of 1. I tried to get the remaining one but they did not believe me. They have bad service toward the customer"}
{"text":"After a long struggle with quality and an identity crisis.  This business comes to a grinding halt.  They had good promise to be better than its original Popeyes start but without a clear vision and diversifying into different areas other than Louisiana chicken related products and staff that did not care of the business did them in.  RIP"}
