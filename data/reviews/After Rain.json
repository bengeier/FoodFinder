{"text":"Ended up in Mississauga a bit early for an appointment so we decided to stop in here for a quick bite. 

We only ordered Japanese dishes, and the tempura was done perfectly and the sushi tasted great. Service was very attentive, though we did get confused because there was a service call button and we didn't get service when we used the call button, but we got great when we weren't using it. 

The space itself it cozy and intimate, I like that they had enclosed spaces for larger groups, but even as a group of two it felt comfortably partitioned. 

Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"It's a nice little sushi place. Actually it's not so small but just medium sized. The quality of their food is good and the overall value is good. Not too expensive or cheap. They have some good deals for $1 sushi. Service is a bit slow sometimes and you could get frustrated if there is a phone call coming when they are trying to use your card for payment. Same telephone line does everything. I have seen other better places to eat sushi nearby however I would still recommend this one for an emergency."}
{"text":"After Rain is great, the food is always fresh and made to order.  They specialize in sushi and  the fish always tastes fresh.  You can also get a membership card to be able to get 15% off your meals and so it is fairly inexpensive in comparison to other sushi places.  They also give you free miso and noodle soup and random mini appetizer trays with every meal.

And for all of those who complained about the service, you just didn't notice the button on the wall.  Each table has a bird chirper button that makes them come right away, making it the fastest service of any restaurant.

This is a great sushi place and I would have nothing bad to say about it!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for some sushi and it was pretty good. Not the absolute best place I've been to but also defintely not the worst place...

Food items:
Soft Shell Crab - served hot and crispy with sweet dipping sauce
Spicy salmon roll - standard roll, nothing special
California roll - it was okay, i've had better...
Sushi, sashimi, maki combo - fresh fish and good quality

It wasnt too busy when we went for dinner and the service was good. I wouldnt mind going back since it's close to my friend's place and the prices aren't too bad."}
{"text":"We went to After Rain with a sizable group of 12. The service was great. Very attentive staff. The food came quickly and was very fresh. The portions are generous. 

People from our party ordered many different kinds of sushi and everyone was happy with their meals, which is rare!

I definitely recommend this place and will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"It was a nice Japanese Korean restaurant to hang out with friends before. I used to like this place. However, recently their hygiene and food went down alot. Not sure is that the day their chef was off or they had a new one instead??!! Anyway, the Green Dragon Roll that my friend ordered came right after we made our order (efficiency is good but  isn't that a bit suspicious!!??). Obviously, it turns out the roll tastes like pre-made or if they did not do so, I would say they just hired a bad chef recently. 
The most disgusting thing happened while I was having my bulgogi. There's a massive Spider was hanging in front of my face which just totally crepes me out and made me want to leave their restaurant. For god sake, how could you eat in such situation. Urghhh.... Sick. 
Things that I mentioned above are so part the biggest issue that I would actually concern in a restaurant. In order to make this review to be completed, I added this as a side note and I hope the owner would also consider about their service. My friend ordered a Green Dragon Roll but the server didn't even notice there is no soy sauce on our table and never attempted to give it to my friend until we mentioned about it. And this kind of disappoint me a bit. As I believe a server should know what did their customers ordered and made adjustment or placement to their dine setting. I might be picky but I am just hoping they can get it back to their original good quality and service restaurant that they used to be before."}
{"text":"If I were to sum up my review of After Rain, I'd say that it's a solid spot to have a la carte sushi and Japanese food. I generally don't like to eat AYCE sushi, due to my pea-sized stomach, and the tradeoff of quality. As such, I look for a good quality and fair-sized portions. (Disclaimer: I've never tried their other Asian cuisines, e.g. Korean, so my review will be based on their Japanese food)

To begin, the decor of this place is quite nice and intimate. it's a little dark, but it might make a decent date restaurant, n'est pas? I've been to After Rain twice - once for lunch, and once for dinner. The lunch specials are well-priced (under $20) and come with a good selection of Japanese food. Prior to your meal, they give a few different types of appetizers. I had the salmon lunch, and the fish was very, very fresh. My second time, I ordered a red dragon roll and an udon bowl. If you're looking to eat as much as AYCE sushi can offer you, you may not be too pleased with the prices. However, the size of the rolls are quite generous. They're carefully made, and as fresh as ever. The udon noodles came in a very large bowl and was quite filling as well. 

Overall, the food is good (not monumental), the prices are fair but can quickly rack up if you're eating a lot, service is decent, and it's a very good go-to place in Mississauga for sushi and Japanese food."}
{"text":"I actually have a mixed feeling of this place....last time I visited here, it made me change a three star. 

Food; We ordered a Korean pancake and it was a bit under-cooked. 
Nice thing about this place is that sushi rolls were consistently huge so it made you full shortly lol I tried a few rolls but all tasted good. Nice complimentary green tea!   

Service; Okay. No complaint. 

Decor; A bit confusing to see cherry blossom all year for Asian lol  

Overall, I still recommend this place if you wish to eat sushi rolls in Mississauga."}
{"text":"\"Amazing! One of my favorite Thai restaurants!\"

So good!! We eat Thai a lot, and this was one of the best, by far.  dragon roll (amazing!) and I had Beef red curry. They also brought us a free grilled mackerel that was really good. 

If you like Thai, definitely come here. Great service, average pricing, and what I consider to be great Thai food!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the restaurant was very beautifully decorated, did not expect that at all. Im quite disappointed in their Korean dishes. They all lacked flavor and our bill wasnt so pretty either. We ordered 4 things off the menu and ended up paying $100 easy. I haven't tried the sushi yet so this review will have to suffice until I do."}
{"text":"My favourite local sushi spot. 

Every meal comes with complimentary green tea and appetizers. The rolls are generously portioned and filling. The lunch specials are fairly priced (expect to spend between $12-16). The staff are prompt and friendly.

I've never had a complaint about this restaurant. There isn't anything that sets it apart from other sushi restaurants, but it's just consistently good and that alone keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant a while ago. nothing impressed me at all. 

There are much better japanese/korean restautant in mississauga area than this one. 

Here is what I thought

1. there is only one side dish given in the mean. Other restaurant normally give 5 or 6 side dishes

2,  food portion is pretty small as well. 

3. service is pretty bad.  They do not come over to your table to check if any empty plate should be removed or tea should be refilled. 

I am not going there any more."}
{"text":"I came to After Rain for a wedding rehearsal dinner. It was an event for both the bride and groom's family to have a mini-celebratory dinner together as many, including myself came from all around the world to attend the wedding. So there had to be like 60+ of us.

The space itself is not impressive on the outside but large and modern inside, they even have private glass enclosures for large groups. However, the service and food has yet to be desired. Unfortunately, serving sizes for the group were pretty minimal. I mean there would be four spring rolls at an 8 person table. So food would run out and tables ended up swapping around food just so everyone could eat.

Also, the staff was so hard to reach and irate with having to constantly come back to refill those tiny bottles of water (jammed full of ice) that they left at the table that eventually they threw pitchers of luke warm (without ICE!) at our tables.

Plus, their noodles and teriyaki chicken wasn't even that great. Noodles lacked flavor and was dry and the teriyaki chicken tasted nearly raw or like not fully cooked. Gross!

Overall, I still had a great time because it was with family but honestly After Rain step your game up. We were a huge party and I'm sure you made a lot of money on us. But had your food and service been amazing we might of brought down the house with food and drinks! Oh well, their loss."}
{"text":"I just want to let people know not to come here. The food prices are okay IF the quality of food and value is there. Just ordered a spider roll and it has the saddest amount of \"soft shell crab\" in it. There's too much batter on the crab and it appears as though only 1/4 of crab was used in the whole roll. The waitress and chef don't acknowledge it or allow you to trade for another dish. Certainly won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"Here's an update! When we visited toward the end of August `09, you won't find anything Thai anymore (except for Thai iced tea).  The place is under new ownership and is currently serving Japanese and Korean fare instead.  The interiors and signage haven't changed so it was confusing at first.  

But the food was great!  Service was great and food came promptly.  My only complaint was that the booths had poor lighting."}
{"text":"This place was quite a disappointment.  It looks good from the outside, but thats where it stops.  Inside is dark, and a little messy.  We were seated in a spot that we didn't like, so we asked to move.  There were much better booths available, not sure why they didn't sit us there to begin with?

Service here is horrendous, and that's why they get the 1/5.  It took forever for a waitress to even get to our table to take our order.  And then even longer to get the bill at the end of the night.  We actually had to get up and find the server to pay our bill.  

The food wasn't anything to write home about either. 

I don't give too many 1's, but this place deserves it.  There are so many other places to go for Japanese food, don't come here!

{"text":"Love this place. Food is awesome, great ambience, it's right by Square One. What more can you ask for! The lunch and dinner menus are both wonderful and the sushi is always fresh."}
{"text":"Decent sushi but nothing amazing. You get several free Korean side dishes. Decently priced lunch specials. I haven't tried their cooked food yet."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I found After Rain about a year or so ago as we were looking for local restaurants that offered Sushi.  Someone recommended trying After Rain and they were not wrong.  

The place used to be a pub so it's generally decorated with a pub-like atmosphere, so the interior is painted slightly darker than you would expect at a traditional Japanese restaurant.  There are booths and tables, as well as an outside patio for the summer.  We have tried the patio in the summer and the service was just as great as it is inside.  

The food arrives quite quickly when you order it, which is good because we both are sometimes in a rush, but with a craving for some good sushi.  If you dine in you will be given three free appetizers in small sampling plates, as well as free miso and another wonton-type soup.  This is a nice start and is complementary, as is green tea.

We regularly get some spicy salmon sushi rolls, which are delicious.  There is a wide variety of what I like to call \"fancier\" rolls, and they are all tasty.  I would recommend the Red Hot and Volcano Rolls.  If you have been to Crazy Sushi, you know how big some of these rolls can get in diameter.  At this place, the rolls are not quite so large but can still pose a challenge to the average sized mouth......We do okay.

The food always tastes fresh, we are always welcomed with a smile, the atmosphere is friendly and the price is really great.  We have eaten plenty to get us both satisfied and the bill has come to under $30! This is always good on the wallet.  They also offer a \"Membership\" (which we have) and with it you can save 15% if you pay cash and 10% if you pay by debit or credit card.  This is a great deal and it also helps give the waiters/waitresses some good tips, as they are well deserved.

Always a good eat. Fast, cheap, convenient.  Highly recommend you try this place!"}
