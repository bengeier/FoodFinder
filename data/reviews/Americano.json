{"text":"I gave my parents a Groupon to Americano for my Mother's 83rd Birthday.  I use to live in Bratenahl and thought this would be a special way for them to celebrate.  I now live out of state.  They celebrated on Friday night and here is their review of Ameicano.  I am embarrassed that this was the dining experience I gave them for this special occasion.  It was memorable - all for the wrong reasons.



My parents had a terrible experience at this restaurant on August 20th.   They reported that the setting and gardens are lovely. They were slightly disappointed that they did not receive a window table as requested.   

They were served nicely prepared cocktails and appetizers were brought promptly to the table.   They  ordered their entrees at 7:50 pm.  They both ordered the duck.  Then the waiting started ........ they waited and waited.  People were seated after them received their entrees while my parents kept waiting.  A little before 9 pm a waiter - not the one that took their dinner order - asked if they wanted to order dessert.  They told the waiter that they preferred to have their entrées first.  The waiter seemed surprised and said he would check but never apologized.  People who were seated near my parents, inquired on their way out of the restaurant,  about what they ordered that they were waiting so long for their food.   During the wait their water glasses were not refilled and no came to their table.  They said that there were a number of servers and other attendants buzzing around the dining room. Their entrees were served at 9:15.  The  Duck  was presented with sweet potatoes and carrots.  The disappointment continued, the duck tasted like a prepared frozen food that had been re-warmed!  The maitre'd asked my Dad, \"Are you enjoying your evening?\"  Always the gentleman my dad responded, \"I rather not answer \".

It was very disappointing dinner experience and not what I had planned for Mom's birthday.   I can understand a bad night in the kitchen or in the dining room.  I cannot accepted my parents waiting for nearly 90-minutes for their dinners or being ignored, water glasses not being refilled,  and no apologies extended.  

My Yelp recommendation to Clevelanders and tourists is to avoid the Americano and celebrate and dine somewhere that takes more pride in their entrees and service."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant in a really weird location--a gated community.  Anyway, if you can get past that part, and having to tell security at the gate that you're here for the restaurant, it's fun.  Our waiter, Merle, was charming, the manager, Cole, came out to chat with us, the wine list was very nice, food was simple and fresh, and although the chef, V, was out of town, I'm told he's the kind of guy who comes out to your table to show you the fresh mushrooms he just bought."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this AMAZING place while looking  for a place to celebrate with my family and friends (recent grad yaayyy me) party of 10. we made reservations a day in advance and surprisingly they were able to get us in at 9:15 at night. Unfortunately we were all late OOPPPSS! but they still seated us. The staff was really great and the food was even better. I ordered the shrimp and polenta (Italian grits) and it was so good that i had to go home and try to duplicate it! after we finished dinner we walked over to their lounge half of the restaurant and had a few drinks made by the owner and talked with him. He was really nice and laid back and treated us like we were his family. I will definitely go back ! great ambiance. great food! great people! and very accommodating ! i loved this place as will u"}
{"text":"We met some friends for dinner at Americano and were amazed at how good everything was.  We arrived early and had drinks at the bar, which can only be described as cozy and warm.  The bartenders were extremely congenial made some great drink suggestions.  We ordered the bacon wrapped dates as an appetizer and thoroughly enjoyed every single bite.  The owner stopped by our seats to talk and see how things were going and was one of the nicest guys we ever met.  He offered some great suggestions for dinner and made sure that we had one of the best seats in the house for the 6 of us that were meeting for dinner in their small and intimate dining room.

I ordered the meatloaf and was COMPLETELY satisfied with it.  Carl, the owner, even kept coming around our table to check on us and would continually clear empty drink glasses.  We all had salads, entrees, dessert and drinks and our bill (for the 6 of us) was around $300, so the price is right and so is the food.  I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this great little hidden secret to anyone that wants to have a nice meal and a very inviting and classy place.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Americano by a friend.  What a pleasant surprise.  It is not hard to find. Just exit at the Bratenahl exit and enter through the gates of Bratenahl Place. The guardhouse will direct you to the restaurant. The dining room and bar areas were somewhat formal, but dress is casual. The menu was small but with such a varied variety of interesting dishes, there is  plenty of items from which to pick.  The salads were large as were the main dishes.  Everything was served beautifully and each dinner was well prepared. The service was perfect. 

This is a hidden gem.  If you want great food in a quiet and a relaxed atmosphere, this should be your pick.  If you go in the evening walk to the Lake Erie and watch the sunset."}
{"text":"Consistently great high quality food. The menu is well thought out and executed. Great drinks and service too. delicious every time and an excellent selection of specials."}
{"text":"Very yummy! It seems like a secret treasure because it is way hidden and out of the way, but totally worth the journey. It's especially great in the summer because there is a great walkway by the lake behind Bratenahl Place. The food is delicious- nice flavors! The chef is very friendly and often comes out to great clients himself, which I always love. It is a great quiet atmosphere- perfect for date night! Also, Tuesday nights in the summer they have grilled pizzas outside- delicious!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. I go.once a month. I love the pork.chop and yam waffles. Staff is so friendly."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Cleveland. We had the best dinners dates here. The food is excellent. The staff is great. Its really a special place."}
{"text":"Fantastic, every time. 

The food is always perfectly prepared, but not always to an Americanized palate. The flavors are on-point, and service is impossibly perfect."}
{"text":"Went to Americano with a Groupon. It's in an odd area of town, along Millionare row, right on the lakefront, inside some sort of gated community. The decor is definitely upscale, and I was optimistic about the food and drink. To start, the bartender clearly had no idea how to prepare the standard drinks listed on the menu, a feeling confirmed by her look of consternation as she studied the menu seemingly closer than I had. The capirinha lacked both mint and sugar (I saw her mix them, and appear to give up halfway and throw the mint/sugar out) and tasted like diluted lime juice. The vesper was similarly...off. But, perhaps the poor girl was just having a bad day.
Next up, the food. The salad consisted of a few leaves drowning in Thousand Island dressing like so many earthworms in a puddle after a rainstorm. The one saving grace came in the form of  shrimp and crabcakes-- not bad.
I was on the fence between 1/5 and 2/5, but the deciding factor was probably the clientele. Perhaps as dissatisfied as we, two of three other tables present seemed to be actively involved in a dispute with the kitchen.

Overall, not worth going, even with a Groupon."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places to eat in Cleveland hands down. In general any scallops dish is to die for. I have been to americano no less than ten times and find the food and experience excellent each and every time. To avoid the stuffy dining room; I suggest eating in the bar.  In a time when places fail to meet expectations americano leaves its competitors in the dust."}
{"text":"I love places that are consistently superb, and the Americano Original Great Lakes Bistro in Bratenahl is one of those places.  I went there last night for the wine sampling and stayed for an excellent meal (had the meat and potatoes) followed by creme brûlée and coffee.  Cole Davis (Host and Co-Owner) and the staff are wonderful."}
{"text":"Americano (the bar area): casual, easy, semi-expensive

*Bar Burger (a pretty tasty burger with delicious fries; I just can't find it on their online menu)."}
{"text":"We normally come here at least once when we visit grandma.
The food is very good and the service is very well.
Our kids love the adult version of Mac & cheese."}
{"text":"I know this place has great food. I love the mussels! But it seems more understaffed each time I come here."}
{"text":"Americano really is a hidden gem, which I only discovered recently. I've been there twice now and the food was outstanding each time. The menu is mouthwatering and innovative --  the clay pot baked shrimp and crispy calamari are fantastic appetizers, and the fancy chicken mac n cheese and duck breast are great mains. Americano has an ambiance you don't come across often these days -- situated on the ground floor of a luxury apartment complex, the dining room has an old-fashioned feel to it, no music playing, just the sound of diners chatting quietly. This isn't a good place to bring kids; many of the diners seem to be older couples who live in these complexes. Americano is the perfect place for a classy, leisurely meal and dinner conversation, followed by a stroll down to the lake. 4 stars instead of 5 because the service varied -- we had a fantastic waiter the first time, but the second time we had a gum-chewing waiter who neglected to tell us the evening's specials and looked like he didn't want to be there."}
{"text":"One word describes my dining experience: surprised.

Surprised at the enormous portions of fresh delicous food.  Surprised at the great price for all of it.  Surprised at the interesting location.  (Inside a gated community)  

Luckily our waiter let us know ahead of time that the portions were big, so my friend and I split an appetizer and a salad, and they were nice enough to split our salad on two plates without us asking.  The basket of mussels was HUGE, and served with a delicous curry sauce.  

The only thing is it took our waiter about 20 minutes to come back after he made sure we had our waters.  But the food and prices so made up for it that I'm not  subtracting anything for it.  

We split a Waldorf salad that had delicious bleu cheese and beets, along with pears, greens, walnuts, and a balsamic drizzle.  Divine.  I'd definitely get this again.

The mussels were piled high on the plate, and fresh and delicious and just a tad bit spicy, perfect.

I got the Chicken \"mac and cheese.\"  Great creamy flavor, and plenty of chicken!  I even brought the chicken home there was so much.  My friend got a shrip pasta dish and also had leftovers.  

Please give this a try, I will definitely go back.  Like others have said, just let the guard know you're going to the restaurant and they'll let you know where to go."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant that most people don't know about it!  It is in Bratenahl Place and owned by a really good guy named Cole. I frequent this place often for dinner but also for their fabulous wine tastings, pizza night and very small, quaint bar. You won't be disappointed with anything you order as neither I nor the people I have sent have. It can be very romantic for a nice date night or just catching up. It is moderately priced and there is a full bar. There are a few craft beers and the wine list is excellent! I highly recommend this restaurant to all. Keep up the good work Cole!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for some time and finally found the right opportunity.  My daughter and I were on our way to a performance and Americano was on the way.   We arrived at 5:15 on a Saturday afternoon.  We were the only customers there, because they don't open until 5:00.  Shortly thereafter, the dining room started to fill-up.  We started out with salads....she ordered the Caesar salad, I ordered the wedge.   The Caesar salad was pretty tasty, except I think the croutons were from a box.  There was a lovely, crusty bread served as a starter that would have made for great homemade croutons.  The wedge was also pretty tasty, except the next time I would ask that they hold the cranberries, didn't mix well with the other components of the salad.  For our entrees, my daughter ordered the truffle mac n cheese, which normally comes with chicken, spinach and mushrooms.  She doesn't like veggies, so she asked for just chicken.  She was completely pleased with the dish.  I tasted a small portion and must agree it was pretty tasty!   I ordered the flank steak and frites, which normally comes with side salad, but was allowed to swap out for broccoli since I had already ordered the wedge.  I ordered the steak medium well and it was cooked perfectly, as were the frites.  The portions were ample.  We finished our entrees, with no room for dessert (maybe next time).   I will return to Americano."}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the past year. First of all, this place is truly a hidden gem. It's hidden inside a condo complex near the shore in a gated community. 

My girlfriend and I had little expectations of this place upon our first visit. But we were blown away with the quality and taste of the food. On all three visits we started with mussels. The first two visits, the mussels were steamed in a very light broth with freshly chopped tomatoes in a white wine sauce. The mussels were very fresh and the broth was flavorful. We couldn't stop dipping the bread into it! However the mussels were prepared differently the third time. It  was steamed but less broth and was topped with fresh and sun-dried tomatoes and drizzled with a mustard base sauce. This was good, but we definitely prefer it with the white wine sauce. Our main dishes over our visits include, sea bass, 20-oz bone in ribeye steak, scallops, and bone in veal steak. The food was pretty impressive. The ingredients were fresh and cooked beautifully. Presentation and pairing of the side dishes were good. The steaks were seared nicely and came out at the right temperature (although the veal had to be cooked medium because of the thick cut/bone). My girlfriend enjoyed the sea bass the best.  All these dishes were simply prepared (basic seasoning & grilled). The dishes were complemented by vegetables such as potatoes, or a puree (the sides tend to vary). The portions were also very generous.  

As much as I'm impressed with the food, the service isn't so great (why it's 4 stars). Over our visits, service seems to decline. There is simply not enough wait staff in our most recent visit. It was on a Thursday night with around 5-6 tables (~20-25 people) but there were only two waiters and one server. It took about 10 minutes after being seated to put in our drink orders and another 10 minutes to order. The food arrived quickly but the wait staff only checked on us once during the service. I guess you have to understand that most of the customers here are residents of the condo. These residents and patrons are typically older people (think 60+/retired) and perhaps the service is good for their pace."}
{"text":"I can't get over how amazing this place is time after time coming here.  I don't think I could ever be disappointed with this establishment.  Every time I go here, the atmosphere is intimate and classy.  Who would think this gem is under an apartment/complex building and often has a groupon running!!  We started off with the bread, which we asked for refills, and a sweet olive oil and balsamic sauce.  Even the the bread wasn't hot, it was fresh.  I think the waiter was kind of shocked we asked for that much bread but I mean we only got 2-3 pieces at a time.  We love our bread so we definitely wanted more.  For our appetizer we had the clay pot baked shrimp, with a fresh corn polenta cake , tomato-wine and garlic sauce, toast, rouille.  IT WAS TO DIE FOR!!! The spices, the shrimp, the melt in your mouth corn made this dish one of the best appetizers I have ever tried.  For our main courses, we have always ordered the special. 

Each dish we have ever had has not been a disappointment but my favorite was the Steak in Bone and lamb chops.  Each of which was seared to perfection and melts in your mouth.  We have also had the veal and that was good but not my favorite.  I like my meat a bit rarer and they usually have to cook that a bit more.  You just can't go wrong with the specials. The ingredients are fresh and the presentation is spot on.  The cook does wonders with his foods and the portions are generous and worth it.  I think the only thing we weren't dying over was the dessert, but by that time who has any stomach left.  We've tried the chocolate lava cake and and caramel brownie which were good but nothing spectacular.  Overall though, one of my favorite spots in all of Cleveland to use a groupon and enjoy a well worth it meal."}
{"text":"Americano is a fantastic hidden gem, and I am so glad I'm in on the secret!

I had never heard of Americano until this past weekend when my parents suggested it for dinner one night. They told me that they had been there a couple times over the summer and had loved it both times, so I was excited to try it out.

The restaurant is located inside of a gated apartment building (you have to tell the guard that you are going to the restaurant to enter the complex). It has a swanky look with its more formal architecture and dimly-lit dining room, but it's friendly, welcoming staff give it a casual atmosphere. Our waitress was really smiley and bubbly, and the bussers were very polite.

All the food was really delicious and well crafted and came in substantial portions. When we sat down, my parents both noted that the menu had changed. In my opinion, it's a good sign when a restaurant tries new dishes and takes into account seasonal produce. As an appetizer, my father got the minestrone soup, which I didn't taste, but he was absolutely raving about it! It looked very hardy, and he ate it up pretty quickly. We also shared a fried oyster special. The batter had a light curry/spicy flavor to it, which was a delicious play on an old favorite. My mother and I both got their special walleye which had a butternut squash puree, couscous, tomatillo salsa, and a small salad. Yes, there were a lot of elements to this dish, but everything went together very well! My father ordered the chicken and ricotta mac and cheese, which was delicious! The chef came out briefly and thanked us for coming in. We all appreciated that he would take the time to check on his customers.

Americano is a great find! I know I'll be back here again!"}
{"text":"First time back in 5 years. It was a very good overall experience. 

Be advised, Monday the main dining room is closed, but the limited bistro menu, served in the bar, and small dinning room/outdoor area is just right. You may not realize this restaurant is there... hidden gem... seek it out. 

The host and server were very accommodating, and helpful with the needs of an older guest who was using a wheelchair. (excellent accessibility). The view from our table, in the smaller dinning room was actually very nice of the verdant grounds. Don't remember the server's name, but she was friendly and professional

We decided on their burger and frites ($14.00) ... Honestly, it's one of the best burgers I've had in years. the Bistro Burger is 7 oz (cooked correctly), applewood bacon, caramelized onions, roasted mushroom and a generous amount of brie... OMG it was a luscious fun meal. The bits that fell off into the frites made for a decedent version of poutine! Enjoyed the house pickles too (not overkill on the vinegar). We really enjoyed the Lava Cake w Praline Ice Cream for dessert too. 

Check out the online menu for \"Mondays\" for the full selection. However, there are some minor discrepancies compared to the actual menu presented at the restaurant.

Hoping to get back for another meal. Very adult-friendly space, not a noisy/trendy W25th/E4th Street type of place. Excellent for conversation, food and for enjoying the company of the people you are with."}
{"text":"We went here on a weekend evening, yet the restaurant was less than 50% full, probably because of the fact that it is in a gated community, so the only way to find out about this place is to live there or go on recommendation. 

Once you get over the strangeness of the location, the food is actually really nice. They do a great job with salads, and the roasted beet & strawberry salad is highly recommended! The food is quite nice and its quite evident that the chef knows his way around the kitchen. The ingredients were all fresh and of high quality. The duck was tenderly and perfectly cooked, but still had the crispy skin (yum!).  The chicken was also good and the pasta that came with it tasted like it had been freshly made. The portion sizes were good, and we were full by the end of the entree.

Overall, a delicious meal. The location is both a pro and a con. Many of the diners are the building's (older) residents and the main dining room is full of (stuffy) Victorian decor, so younger folks may not enjoy the setting as much. That being said, the complex is lakefront and there are trails and paths around the complex, which makes for a romantic ending to the meal. I give it a 3 star A-OK, 4 for the food, 2.5 for ambiance, but I will probably return, just because I enjoyed the food so much!

Recommended for: Dates (intimate dining room + sunset + lakefront = yes!), interesting take on Euro-American fusion
Not recommended for: Young adults, noisy people, kids"}
{"text":"Dinner with DH.  It was ok.  We really enjoyed the quiet atmosphere and didn't find it stuffy as others have said.  It was very relaxed and we felt welcome to linger and chat, which is a nice change.  

We shared the charcuterie plate- skip it.  The salami was extremely greasy and another cured meat on the board (unfortunately we were never given a \"tour\" of the sampler and had only a vague idea of what we were eating) was literally inedible- I chewed and chewed and chewed and finally gave up.  It was very odd.   Cheeses were ok, nothing special. The promised mostarda never materialized.

For mains we had two specials; a dry aged strip steak and walleye.  It was nothing special, the steak was a fantastic cut of meat cooked really perfectly, but the umami sauce was unfortunately too liberally applied and it turned out to be a very salty dish.  There was no relief from the too-large sweet potato fries with skin on, which had a nice crisp outside/fluffy inside texture but had the tough skins on and were bland.  The ketchup was umami-spiked so where I would have enjoyed the vinegar to cut through the salt of the dish there was more savory-salt.  Creamed kale was interesting but a very one dimensional profile of salty cream.  I love kale and was disappointed because there was no kale taste to this at all.  Husband found the walleye clean and well prepared if a little plain.  

Desert was pretty basic and average.  We did enjoy our dinner here.  I've mentioned the environment already and there was a nice pace to the meal.  The food wasn't the best but was satisfying and the ingredients were extremely fresh and seasonal so we'll definitely give it another go."}
{"text":"One of the best meal for the price you can have, charming ambiance and perfect for a private date."}
{"text":"Another home run at Americano. I had an appetizer of clay-pot baked shrimp in garlic w/polenta. Plenty of flavor, plenty of shrimp. This appetizer could be a lunch. As usual, Chef V is not shy with flavors and spices. Same as the sauce graniche that accompanied my (perfectly blanched) white and green asparagus. Redolent with flavor. Again, a strong and deft hand by the chef. Homemade pickles -check. Homemade mustard -check. Incredible panne-cotta with blackberries and coulis - oooooh yeeeaaaahh. 
The dining room was nicely dressed with quality artwork displayed from a local gallery. Clean windows showcased a spectacular sunset after a rainy day. 

I'm liking this eastern-euro fusion menu. Put this place on your short list.

Carry on."}
{"text":"I would have never imagined that a gem like this would be hiding on the first floor of a Bratenahl high-rise. If you go, and I think you really should, you will have to pull up to the gate and tell the security guard you are there to have dinner and that you're not a resident of the building.

On first glance, the menu seems fairly standard but everything seems to have a special twist that delights the taste buds. The bar area is wonderfully intimate and the bar staff provided me with endless entertainment. Around 6pm, the locals come down for a cocktail before they migrate back upstairs or head out to the orchestra. The bar itself is superbly stocked and the drinks are excellent. The food is to die for.

Highly recommended for a cocktail or a great dinner with a group or all by yourself - the staff will keep you company."}
{"text":"I received a Groupon as a gift and I had never previously heard of Americano. I live very close by so it was easy to find and parking was close. Valet would be a nice addition. Our food selections were amazing! I had the lamb served over greens with a pomegranate goat cheese, talk about delicious! My mother ordered the Atlantic salmon served with a radish & carrot mixture and she loved it! For dessert we had the creme brûlée, which as someone who orders it often, was cooked perfectly. I'm so glad I was given that Groupon. I would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Finally we found this place and its a pretty fancy looking restaurant located in a fancy looking building off the lakeshore drive. We had the crab cake and calamari to start with. I liked my calamari. It was fried crispy but still chewy and juicy inside. Nice carbonation. The mustard lemon sauce was nice to have at the beginning. But after dipping that sauce for a while, I feel like it was getting a little too lemon heavy. The spicy sauce was not so catchy to begin with but finished very strong. I particularly liked the salad on the bottom of the plate. I can't speak much for the crab cake cuz I only had a few bites of it. All I could say was it was very \"crabby\", in a good way.
For entree I had the sword fish and my bf ordered the duck breast. I wanted to have swordfish cuz I know what it looks like when it's alive but I've never eaten it and I was curious what it would taste like. Knowing that it's a large fish, prob having a high Mercury level in it, but I was willing to \"risk\" it haha. When the dish came along, I was very surprised that It was soaked in a ton of red sauce, plating was also a little scattered. I had a bite of the sauce in combo with the fish, and immediately I regretted ordering this dish. It was very spicy and a little too salty and the fish almost felt like it's overlooked. I could not taste the natural flavor of the fish at all. The sauce was definitely overpowering. I tried the polenta, and it was nice. I could not believe we paid 30 for this dish. So I asked to switch with my bfs duck. Luckily, I think the duck tasted better and my bf liked the swordfish, so it worked out.  However, in no way was I saying the duck was really good. It was better, but the duck breast still needs a lot of help. It was cooked medium perfectly and very juicy and tender. The skin was crispy and nicely carbonated. But I just feel like the marinate is missing something. It tasted too one dimensional to me. The jam to pair with the duck breast was way too sweet. The best part of this entree was the sweet potato and spinach... Plating also needs some work.
For dessert we went with the blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream. The pie had no top crust and the outside crust was nutty and soft. Not the crisps type I was looking for but I liked the consistency actually. The stuffing was a lot of blueberry, although it does feel like this pie has been sitting in the kitchen for a while. The vanilla ice cream was spot on.
Overall, very good and comfortable dining environment, service was great. The dish was a little disappointing for the price, so three star for now!"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon deal for this place. It was hard to find it at first but it's located on the 1st floor of a gated high rise apartment. The food was good and the service was spectacular! Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. I give this place a 4 out of 5 because I thought that the food took awhile to come out even though it was not busy. Overall, I enjoyed this place and would definitely come back!"}
