{"text":"This is a great example of how not to run a business.

The photographs on the website appear to be lies. I have uploaded photos to show how they are absolutely nothing like what is being offered. Here's some of the many issues I experienced with this restaurant, and why I won't be coming back. I really should have just stuck with a typical fast food chain for $10 - I would have had better tasting food.

1) The phone number listed on their official website doesn't work. It immediately goes to voicemail. The mailbox is not set up. It disconnects. You can't even leave a message. I tried from my cell phone and my work phone.

2) Nobody answers the email. I emailed them two weeks ago (email address found on their website) to let them know I was interested in placing an order, and nobody answered. Two weeks ago. I didn't get a reply. Checked my junk mail just in case, but no - no reply.

3) Some items on the menu don't exist. I didn't find this out until I walked into the store to actually place my order.
 An example - tried to order this awesome looking dog called the Chili Willy. Doesn't exist.

4) The food looks absolutely nothing like it does on their website. I ordered Trois Fromage Poutine and got french fries with shredded cheese and a little gravy on top.
 See attached photos.

5) Their Half Pound Cheeser was boring and the meat was a little tough and dry. It did have an interesting seasoning to it, but the whole experience was ruined by the dismally small amount of cheese on the burger and the previous lack of quality customer service that you would expect.
 Again - see attached photos. Vaguely reminds me of limp celery after three weeks in the fridge.

I have never experienced ordering food and discovering it to be so drastically different / less than what was depicted in the Hollywood photos on the website.  You'd almost think that you had stumbled accidentally across another website with the same name - until you confirm that no, it's the right website because the address is accurate. Two stars seems generous. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Truth be told. This place is a cool looking place to hang out and chill at. It is just so sad to see how this place is run. Service is the worst ever. You could have made so much money on drinks at my table.  We had a table of 10. All of whom drinks like fishes. We even ubered there. We were there to watch the game and have a good time but they managed to screw that up too. We wanted another pitcher, went through two waitress telling us that they can't get it and would get someone else to... Are you freakin serious?!?!?! How hard is it to fill up a pitcher with beer???? They would leave us hanging go to the bar and hang out. Wow talk about being  LAZY!  If i was the owner of that place, everyone would be fired!!!! For real!! Dead serious!! Have had bad service before but this place went to another level of crap service!!! Horrible!!"}
{"text":"Another bar that will not survive. With Chain restaurants like Boston Pizza within minutes of your location that accept SPC and don't auto-charge tip, it's going to be hard competition. 

Underwhelming beer selection, wait staff that don't know the menu well enough and dirty cutlery...needless to say my friends and I will not be returning. Would give this place a 0 out of 5 stars if that was an option. Steer clear, lots of better options in the area."}
{"text":"All the chairs in this restaurant are leather couches. The tables are low, like the kind you'd have in your family room at home. To top it all off, the booth we got during our visit was accompanied by a 50\" TV that we could set to whatever channel we want. Pretty cool, right?

Old School is a bar that looks designed to simulate an 80s/90s hangout spot. There are arcade games lining the walls, foosball tables, pool tables, and board games available upon request. It really did a good job of bringing out some childhood nostalgia. We ended up playing Jenga, Battle of the Sexes, and Yahtzee and had quite a good time.

The food menu was your typical pub food - nothing too adventurous here. I ordered the Southern Style Chicken Fried Steak because I remember the picture on the online menu looked amazing. Others in my party had the poutine fries and the chicken and waffles.

The bar menu was surprisingly not very deep... When we asked what beers they had, our waitresses' reply was \"domestic and imported\" (what?).

The wait time for our food was quite long, but this was to be expected with a new restaurant (we were there in the 4th day of business). However, one thing that bothered me is that my food came nearly 20 minutes after the rest of my party got their food. This is way too big of a gap and led me to believe that my order was forgotten. In the meantime, I just tried a few of the poutine fries, which were actually quite good. Based on my friends' reactions, the chicken and waffles were pretty good as well. 

When my food finally came, my first thought was ... this looks nothing like the online menu! Where was the breading? Where was the gravy? I didn't think much of it then, and just ate. The fries were good, but the chicken just tasted mediocre... It definitely did not take much effort to make. 

Looking at their menu on their website afterwards, I realized that none of our dishes looked like the website pictures! So I decided to do a quick google search, and their chicken steak picture was actually from MyRecipes.com (http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/chicken-fried-steak-3)! Really Old School? I ordered that dish based on the picture on your website!

If you've been to the restaurant, you'll notice that the pictures used on the website aren't of the actual restaurant either. I'm not sure why this was done? In the age of Instagram where a picture truly is worth a thousand words, why misrepresent your menu, much less your entire space? If the Contact page didn't specify the address, I would be certain this was a website for a different restaurant.

I want Old School to do well because I like their concept of bringing childhood nostalgia to a restaurant. But from my visit there, I'm just very, very confused."}
{"text":"Such an amazing idea and theme. Only issues are the consoles are reserved by only two groups of people who don't even use them. The beer choices are very minimal. 2 out of 3 of the pinball machines dont work, the \"galaga\" arcade machine which is the only good one there doesn't take your quarters. And it's seriously understaffed. One girl working the bar, the bar area, and the lounge. With probably only one person in kitchen because it took almost 45 minutes to get our food. That being said the ONE worker was amazing, she was super helpful and friendly and probably deserves a raise. I really want this place to survive and hope they make the right decisions to fix it up. My chicken fried steak was very very dry, and although they gave me the wrong fries they gave me my right fries extra and free of charge so that was super nice. The chicken and waffles was okay but not the best. My follow up visit/review will be the make or break decider. Probably during one of the next UFC events..."}
