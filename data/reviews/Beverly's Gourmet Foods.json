{"text":"All around good food. All vegan and veggiterian. Lots of gluten free options and made with the same ingredients I'd use to cook at home. I love a good stake dinner from time to time but Beverly has the health food when I need a quick meal for the family and I'm rolling through town. I also love that I can get some fresh farmers market produce while I'm there from her father. Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"If you're looking for healthy options check out Beverly's Gourmet Foods at this location and also sold in Whole foods and Home Economist.  Some of my favorite's are the athlete's lunch, barley soup, and veggie casserole."}
{"text":"Beverly is a super nice lady and her business sells a wonderful variety of products made with integrity and quality ingredients. Her ready-to-eat products can be purchased locally in grocery stores or from an indoor, farmers-market style produce market that is one-of-a-kind."}
{"text":"Beverly's is always a good bet! This tiny store, which is sandwiched in the CMC Main complex, offers both Beverly's pre-made meals and a farmer's market.
Beverly's only offers vegan and vegetarian options, and her meals can be relied on for tastiness and healthiness.
Beverly's fills four standing fridges and offers products from soups to quiches to casseroles. My favorites include the Athlete's lunch (quinoa, greens, herbs) and any of her soups. Prices for each dish vary from $5-$10, usually. It's a MUCH more delicious option than any Healthy Choice or Smart One from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Beverly's makes excellent food. I have had the pimento cheese, hummus, borsht, tomato bisque, broc casserole, tomato pie, quiches, many of the salads, but my all time favorite is the stuffed shells. The casseroles are great to freeze for later when you are looking for something super easy, wholesome, and tasty. 
You can always count on a fresh selection of things from Beverly. She is constantly adding and creating new dishes for us.
By the way... her tarts are amazing too!!!"}
{"text":"Locally made, ready to eat delicious food? Thanks, Beverly's!

I've had the pleasure of snacking on a myriad of Beverly's Gourmet Foods - dips, hummus, pimento cheese and most recently, tomato spinach pie! Let me tell you, if you haven't had her tomato pie - it's magical. Also, while the veggie spread is reminiscent of veggie cream cheese there's an influx of freshness that kicks it up a notch. Spread it on bread, crackers or the back of your hand. Whatever works. 

You can find these tasty eats at a myriad of grocery and specialty shops around town (Reid's, FABO, Mecklenburg County Market, Atherton Mill Market). I have yet to eat an item from Beverly's Gourmet Foods that I didn't want to hug. Check out her website and get yourself some goodness."}
{"text":"Just an update: I had the misfortune of trying chili by Beverly's Gourmet at the South End chili cook-off.  It was easily Worst of Show! That's some really bad advertising.  Well deserved for a crappy business! 

I had the misfortune of buying a Groupon for a cooking class by Beverly's Gourmet.  I soon realized that given the large number of Groupons sold relative to the extremely small number of cooking class slots allotted to Groupon holders that it was going to be nearly impossible to book a class. While I was having a very difficult time getting a class booked, Groupon was again offering this \"deal\".  After numerous attempts I finally managed to get a class scheduled.  I left work early to get to the class on time, but upon arrival I was told that the class had been canceled.  I was not contacted in advance to inform me of this which I consider to be extremely rude and unprofessional.  Unfortunately, I was unable to get my money refunded.  My time was wasted.  My money was wasted.  Total rip off."}
