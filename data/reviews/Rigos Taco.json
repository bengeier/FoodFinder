{"text":"The best Chile relleno I have ever had!  I was so impressed with this place.  Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Bad experience. My boyfriend and I spent $30+ on two different meals that made us both sick . Never going again!"}
{"text":"Well when they say cheese they mean nacho cheese! If I wanted nacho cheese I could have made my own food! It was soggy an an kinda gross but my husband loved his burrito! So at least one of us was happy!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Three carne asada tacos with some chips and beans and a drink for 3.99.  Prices are very inexpensive and the food is great.  The decor inside is just booths.  Nothing fancy.  Great place for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food is Really GOOD. But I'd rather spend $30 bucks @ mar y Tierra - THE GOOD: The fries have this seasoning salt that makes me want to drive there & deal w the lady who does not get the order right over & over. Lol.  Burrito de carne Asada con frijoles y queso solo = BOMBAY!  THE RATING: Why 3 stars? it's a bit pricey ? Like $25-30 every time we go for 2+child..& no real Aguas - the ones in the machine like Roberto's..but on the flip side they hv fresh squeezed oj..pricey but unique.. It's the best close to home.. The fries ooh those fries So I'm caught between 3 & 4 stars If The cashier could listen (& shes ALWAYS there.. Lol) better 9x out of ten the burrito has something like rice we did NOT want ruining the marriage of cheesy beans & carne Asada ..so 3.5 stars?!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas from Chicago. I went here solely on the yelp ratings. It was well worth it. Good food. Good price. Clean. Lots of guys on their lunch were there, which tells me its good eatin."}
{"text":"When i was younger i would always come here and order a carne asada torta because they were just so delicious but when i recently went i decided to try a new plate and i went for the carne asada fries and they were amazing! Not as good as robortos though . I still suggest anyone to try this plate. For me one plate feeds 2-3 people lol and with there salsa verde just made this plate even better. But service is kind of sucky and rude so I'm giving it a 3 star for the food(:"}
{"text":"This place has some bomb ass hot sauce i always grab a carne asade burrito cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. I enjoyed the large quantities and the environment is pretty cool. They have a music box and nice condiment area."}
{"text":"Scott D. has this place pretty much spot on.  We usually order the Gringo dinner (I think that is what its called) which is burger and fries with 3 tacos.  It's around $6 and its all pretty decent.  Its cheap and quick, basically.  Similar to Tacos Mexico (which is just down the street), if you live in the area its a good place to go but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here.  We would usually hit it up on our way back from the Palms.  Don't expect much more than typical mexican food with some american stuff thrown in and you'll be happy you came."}
{"text":"I ordered super nachos to go and paid with the credit card. When I reviewed my receipt at home I noticed the cashier took it upon herself to give herself a tip without my permission. This is considered theft and she should be fired and arrested for stealing from a customer. This is so unbelievable and I am beyond upset known this type of thing happens. The cashier knew there was no way I would catch it cause I didn't have to sign the receipt. Please be very careful if you visit the restaurant and have to pay with your credit or debit card."}
{"text":"Love this place. Super Nachos and the chicano meal is enough for 4 people $25.00 is a great price just need to add more drinks. The lady who takes the order is always nice and I have never had a bad experience with food or service. Would have added a picture however I didnt have Yelp before I ate it! Go and enjoy.  But go hungry."}
{"text":"Usually, when you go to hole in the wall places the food is always exceptional and worth the trip. However, in this case it was the exact opposite. The food was not that good. I was actually disappointed. I was expecting kick ass carne asada or al pastor tacos. To my dismay, I had better food at a Baja Fresh in an all gringo neighborhood. Minus three stars for wasting my trip to North LV.   Historical Note: This place used to be a Boston Pizza # 5 a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away."}
{"text":"The food was OK at best. Tacos were dry, enchiladas were 90% cheese, guacamole was runny and strangely sweet (obviously powder package). On top of the mediocre food they wouldn't take the restaurant.com coupon which was the reason to try eating here in the first place. Bottom line is I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Rigos is ummm ok i guess.  The service is great, and quick.  However the food is lacking flavor.  It's not bad, but i feel like they have the potential to be great.  I've been there several times, and each time I've left feeling a little bit  unsatisfied.   The carne asada is simply just cooked meat.  Nothing stands out about it.   They do give generous food portions tho."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!!  My family, out of town guests, and I have enjoyed Rigo's food for the last 10 years.  It IS a small out of the way place with food that is authentic and yummy!  The beans and rice are fabulous and not just a blah side dish!  There isn't a dish that I wouldn't recommend....  Give it a try.  It's simple Mexican fare, but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Boo-urns. This place was awesome back in the day. Now its complete garbage. We went there today and the place looked kinda skanky, thought it was just cause we were there in a slow time of day. Nope its just shitty now. We ordered super nachos and tacos. well they were out of Chicken and elpasdor (spelling?) . So we went with Carne Asada. It took them about 15 minutes to make our food ( which I dont mind if im waiting for fresh good food ). And when we got home we realized that our nachos were fries! Wah wah wah. And they were gross, not fried all the way through and the Carna Asada tasted like it was from a horse rather than a cow. Im sad that this place sucks now. But they seem to not care about the customers anymore and for that I say \" Shame on you Rigos Tacos \". I will drive a little further for Tacos El Gordo next time."}
{"text":"Their Carne Asada Fries are amazing! They use these nice thick fries & are very courteous with their portions.  I always add extra carne & it's so worth it.  Their chili beans are homemade & you can't find anything like it anywhere else. They have some salsa selections, wish they had something spicier, but the grilled onions in the bar are delicious! Only other dislike is the extra charge for using debit cards."}
{"text":"we ordered a to go order and they messed our order. when we called to get the order corrected the lady was very rude and kept yelling at us. food is good but the service sucks..."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in your friendly Nor Las Vegas open 24/7for your dining needs. Carne asada  fries, carne asada super nachos, tacos they are all good. They are always busy good sign. Their service is fast!"}
{"text":"Best taco shop in town!!!! Nothing compares to their flavor!!!! And service is always good. We always get the lunch special which consists of three perfectly portioned tacos and chips with refried beans. My office is located very close to their restaurant and my entire office staff  all visit on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Very tasty tacos... and a damned sight better than Taco Hell! Got a variety of fillings - carne asada, al pastor, pork carnitas and chicken. All well cooked and served fast. Road destruction on Las Vegas Boulevard makes for confusing driving."}
{"text":"Ok so I have a couple of things, firstly the food is always a hit or miss. It's either good and fresh or old and cold. Secondly the $1 tip I've seen a couple of people mention is the $1 fee they charge for using a card it's clearly posted on the machine. However this cashier is always there and she is always super rude!!! I'm not sure how she has kept her employment for this long! I have family and friends who have had similar experiences with her. She always messes up orders and when you try to get them fixed she fights with the customer! The owner should look into the attitude she gives all customers!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good the service was really good if you're looking for a good authentic Mexican food nothing special just a quick lunch this is a good place to be"}
{"text":"Their burritos de lengua are the best in the city! I've tried them everywhere but none compare to Rigo's burritos. Also their Horchata water and red salsa. It's my favorite place to grab and go. The staff is attentive and always friendly. I've been a customer since 2010 and no other place in Las Vegas makes their burritos so big and so delicious. It's close to the strip by the way, don't hesitate and try their burritos"}
{"text":"A good place to stop for quick cheap lunch if you're in the area. They have specials (although they've been increasing in price over the years) such as 3 taco plate and burger w fries. It's not unlike other taco shops. Order at the counter & they prep your food & you pick it up at the counter. You can also call in your order and pick it up.   They offer traditional taco shop fare such as carne asada, chicken, lengua etc. Menu Items include burritos, tacos, tortas, rolled tacos, carne asada fries and oddly enough cheeseburgers.  I really like their pickled carrots & red salsa & the food is better than a nearby taco shops on Sahara.   Due to location, the clientele include mostly blue collar guys. It's okay to visit during the day, but I avoid the neighborhood at night."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that I come here for the cheeseburgers, but I do. They aren't the best burgers in the world, but they are reasonably priced and taste good. The patties are pretty thin, so I usually get a double. They take a sesame bun, grill it, and slather their version of thousand island on both sides. Then they add fresh shredded lettuce, sliced tomato and onions. I don't know why the burger is so delicious, but it keeps me coming back. I sometimes get their burger special, which comes with fries and a fountain drink for around $5. I think it's extra to make the burger a double, but it is still a good deal.  Not into burgers? They have other food as well. Tacos, burritos, taquitos and nachos are the mains. The nachos come with your choice of meat, beans and liquid cheese, but I don't like liquid cheese on my nachos. I do like to get the cheese on the side to dip my fries into though. Speaking of fries, they come very well seasoned and it is a bit overpowering, so I order my fries sans salt. Many of the dishes come with tortilla chips, so load up on some fresh made salsas at the salsa bar. They also have a hot bar with pinto beans and grilled jalapenos. Oh and they have a music box to play tunes while you eat!"}
{"text":"Really bomb Mexican food. The Carne asada they put into the burritos and tacos is so crispy and we'll done. The atmosphere is petty chill and the food is really inexpensive for the amount you get."}
{"text":"I love love love their Chicken Salad.  Chicken is grilled and cut into small pieces and laid on a bed of lettuce with carrot shavings, shredded cheese, white onion and tomatoes... PLUS they add orange wedges and a side of Thousand Island type dressing (I'm sure they make in-house) and it's so delicious! Price is a bit high at $8 or $9 but the entire take out tray is full and super pack and it barely closes  I highly recommend you try it and share the salad with a person.  Trust me, you won't finish it yourself"}
{"text":"ive been coming here for years! Used to be awesome until they decided that people that begs for food deserves better device than their usual customers who normally spend about $50 dlls every time they come. They decided it was best to give away tacos to a lady bothering her customers and allow her to eat and keep bothering people that just spent money on their business. Sorry but if I go somewhere to eat I expect to eat peacefully and comfortable. She kept harassing the people I was with and \"Lupe\" did nothing to keep her customers most of our food was thrown away the lady was allowed to have FREE food and bother people. When I asked to speak with the manager according to them \"Lupe\"another one she was defensive her story was differentno asked for my money back since my good was thrown away and she gave a whole other story the managers name and number was declined also the owners number. This is a business that has been out there for a while u all know better than that! Alex has always been nice and help his customers but the shit that just happen really took me by surprise I understand the act of kindness by giving someone food however Lupe hanging up on me when o asked for a manager and that other Lupe claiming to know it all and be the person in charge and call us a liar. Whoever is the owner \"Rigoberto Melendez\" needs to take care of his people and be available for his usual clients.  If you expect to eat and peace and have a good time this isn't the place"}
{"text":"So I'm not sure what the other guy was talking about Rigo's is awesome, the food is amazing and cheap, I eat there once or twice a week. It's not just me either, I'm in the military and everybody in my shop loves Rigos. We even have Rigos Wednesdays haha. If someone mentions Rigos I have to go there. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So I decided to go to This Tacos. I usually pass this place up due to prior bad food experiences here. The food was OK. But what pissed me off was I used my debit card and the lady added a dollar tip on it. This place is like a McDonald's, you order your food they fix it, you pick it up from the counter. What da hell did she do to deserve a dollar?"}
{"text":"Rigos tacos is awesome! I was surprised to see their Yelp rating. Everytime I have been there my food was great. My favorite fast Mexican food place in Vegas. They have good portions, good food, and an awesome red sauce!"}
{"text":"I can see why people that rated it low did so. You've never ate at another Rigos tacos before and it's understandable. Heck you've probably not know what authentic street tacos are either, or you haven't even ate REAL Mexican food outside of Las Vegas. Las Vegas Mexican food sucks so I understand.    Anyway to my review. These tacos taste are comparable to tacos in Los Angeles. The only think i felt was missing was that I wasn't eating them in L.A. The thing that taste the same are the beans. Real good! To compare the taste... It taste like a blend of Tacos Mexico and Tacos el gordo, BUT in between. Without the tortilla they use in El Gordo, or the Avacado. Remember it's street style tacos.    I didn't like the parking situation, or spot. If that damn liquor store in the corner was gone it would be nicer. The bathroom sucks ass. Feels like a low class night club ahaha. Anyway the counter lady was somewhat snotty Pissed me off. But the food was so so good! Remember STREET TACOS! Don't expect these tacos to have over the top flavor, but its just a regular taco you get out and about.    The chile was dead on to the ones I've tastes also. Definitely coming back because the place made me forget about being here in Las Vegas,"}
{"text":"I went in here for a quick bite. I had just went to my favorite taco shop on Lake Meade only to discover that they had closed.  The menu is pretty normal for a local Mexican place.  I ended up having the birria.  The soup was very good, they served it overfull so a lot of soup splashed on the plate and soaked up the napkins, which I needed.  The corn tortillas were not homemade but the order came with 5 tortillas instead of the normal 3 that I have experienced at other places.  the beans and rice were very good and they had a good selection of onions, tomatoes and cucumbers on the plate.  The goat was very well cooked and fell off the bones when you tried to pick it up.  The atmosphere was a little weird with a jukebox that comes on randomly at a very high volume.  There was a homeless guy there and they were doing a pretty good job of dealing with him and keeping him from hassling the other patrons.  This place is definitely a dive but the food was very good and I will stop in here again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Nice sopes and service from the old lady she is very nice and kind!!! The guy next to her a paisano little mamado he is very nice to people too , food was perfect, customer satisfaction beyond the sky!!!!!! Many specials!!!! Decorations in the wall and paintings are very Mexican, dint have a chance to check the bathroom but seems like a very clean place, parking outside is very crowded, the agua the pinaple is very refreshing, atmosphere feels good. Prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"My favorite taco spot in town! After moving here from Los angeles i was looking for something similar to king taco, i finally found it! Definitely a regular here its good and cheap! #goodEats #dank"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Second time here, and it was just as good as the first time. Staff is very nice as well.   They load the tacos with meat. The meat is juicy and has lots of flavor.  I definitely recommend this please."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before I came in to Rigo's and I'm on the floor laughing. The lady really does tip herself $1.00! The B*tch looks like she killed Selena. The audacity! I witnessed her doing it too, I didn't say anything because... Well I just wanted to confirm if it was true.   Anyhow, food was ok. Kinda pricey, $16.20 PLUS $1.00 (unauthorized) tip, totalling $17.20 for a quesadilla and a burrito.   Won't come in again, I'm OK with it but it's not ok."}
{"text":"Im not sure how people call it clean! DIRTY!!!!! DISGUSTING!!!! DIRTY!!!!! Small, dirty, hot, disgusting place! No AC, just a ceiling fan. The food is OK if you like grease! I ordered a steak quesadilla and the grease was running down my hands. The portions are huge, prices are low. Nevertheless, I will not go there again."}
{"text":"Always CLEAN and PLENTY of room to EAT-IN. PLUS they always remember your face even though they may not speak english they KNOW what you want. The murals all over are very soothing TOO Consistent. Always the same thing. Burgers & Fries are REALLY good. Tacos are good, NOT very spicy though, red & green sauce are a little mild. They do not grill the tortillas. Which is good if you don't like the mess BUT if you like them flavorful you WANT grilled tortillas A MEDIOCRE MEXICAN TACO STAND A real nice lunch spot. If you only have 30 minutes and you just wanna get full this is good for you. YOU need to special order here and tell them to add chileS to everything to spice it up but the MEATS are very tender & good NOT that OTHER stuff. If you want a GOOD fast food burger try one and the fries are ALWAYS fresh. EVERY thing is MADE TO ORDER"}
{"text":"wow, the places you'll go when you're hungry....  actually was working on some property in area, needed to find close place for lunch for myself and work crew, Rigo's was the spot  ordered the taco plate special which included a drink and 4-5 small street style tacos pretty good for price, I think was about 20 bucks for 3 orders  we all got the carnitas, and appearance of the restaurant aside, they were actually pretty decent  I know the salsa bar looks like crap, and restaurant could use a makeover, but seriously guys, look at the area....kind of to be expected!  Gotta have your pickled carrots, radishes and jalapenos to accompany the tacos right?  I'm from the los angeles area, so in comparison, these were actually decent tacos not anything special, or a place to go out of your way for, but if you need a quick, cheap bite in the area, this place will do.  have actually been here a few times now, sometimes they don't have counter person that speaks English....but not hard to order, plus you can always just point to pics of specials!  again, be realistic with your expectations and you'll be fine here."}
{"text":"The super nachos here will probably be the reason for my death (or at least my morbid obesity). BUT I DON'T CARE. Great food at a cheap price. Gigantic portions. Lots of menu options. Only two complaints: 1) they charge you $1 extra if you use a card to pay. 2) the staff could be a little friendlier. I just feel like I'm doing a business transaction any time I go there."}
{"text":"Authentic \"street\" tacos, very meaty! Appreciate the chips and beans added on to the plate to scoop up left over meat! However a little on the pricey for tacos."}
{"text":"Their soups are really good. I enjoy their taquitos with the rice and beans. I wasn't a huge fan of their Chile Relleno. I've had way better elsewhere. Their teak fast items are yum, too."}
{"text":"This is simple the food is awesome. The service is kinds lousy and for that -2. Every time I go I see my self getting almost the same thing(carne asada burrito add cheese) unless hungover I get menudo.(very seldom) but every time they forget that cheese I am all like I paid for it, so I want it. The food is awesome. :)"}
{"text":"I walked in late at night. Seemed like your average taco shop. I got the 5 taco meal with horchata. The horchata was great, delicious! Flavor was amazing compared to other places who serve it watered down. The carne asada tacos were pretty phenomenal, with a side bar full of salsa, limes, onions, cilantro, and much more. The service was good, I was greated at the door and served extremely fast. I would definitely recommend this place to whom ever is looking for great tacos at an affordable price!"}
{"text":"EJay, I don't know what the heck you're talking about, but coming from a Mexican,  this place has all your standard Mexican carnes and plenty of options: tortas, burritos, tacos, menudo, etc at affordable prices and plenty of drink options with FREE refills. I don't recommend going on Sundays due to the swap meet being close by, it can be packed. Also, this place, like other great Mexican hole in the wall places, are full of Mexicans eating there. That's when you know it's great. If you're not Hispanic, don't feel intimidated, the cashier (from my experience at least) speaks English."}
{"text":"I don't usually review places I don't like but this place is bad. The food is overpriced, greasy and not good at all. Never again shall I go here sorry."}
{"text":"I'll give it two stars because the service is great the food is OK but I just went for a bean and cheese burrito and the darn cheese was COLD not even warm and not melted it tasted like it came out the fridge I almost puked by trying to eat it. It's the simplest thing to make and because of that I won't go back here. Sorry but not sorry. Put more effort in the food instead of trying to make it so fast. I won't say everything was nasty though the carne asada tacos are bomb the sauces are bomb but my bean and cheese incident ruined it for me lmao"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but on closer inspection, rest room looks dirty with graffiti everywhere.  I tried the carne asada was not fresh, cold and bland.  Al pastor was over cooked but edible. The carrots as well as the rice was very mushy. Over all the food seemed to be stale."}
{"text":"This is a really good little Mexican joint. The food is really good and authentic. Kinda sketchy part of town after dark but food is worth it. The carne asada fries are the bomb!!! Definitely a must have!! My wife usually gets the bean and cheese burito she loves it, overloaded with beans and great cheese!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Awesome carne asada. Don't like the flat $1 charge for credit cards"}
{"text":"I don't get to that part of Vegas much, but the food there, in my opinion, is good and the staff will make the food my way.  The \"hot sauce\" has a nice smokey flavor to it that compliments the food."}
{"text":"Very authentic. The place seems to be a little run down comparably to other similar restaurants. The food those is extremely tasty. I have never had a bad experience with the food."}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot and the food was always good. However, the food has gone downhill. I would always order the same, either tacos de carnitas or the taquitos, and they started serving me dry meat or burnt taquitos. Now whenever I go I'm not sure what I'm going to get so I don't go here much anymore."}
{"text":"Great place for a decent burrito. Love the carnitas burrito from Rigos but this trip we went for the carnitas tortas. I personally was not happy with them as the bread was not toasted and the torta had not been cut in half making it hard to handle and since they had not toasted the bread kind of soggy.  I will stick with a burrito in the future. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am shocked this place does not have more reviews. Truly a hidden gem for Mexican food in Las Vegas. Easily the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. I come here at least once a week.   I always order the super especial which comes with 3 tacos (carne asada), chips and a drink. All for $3.99. Rigos delivers on taste and the prices can't be beat."}
