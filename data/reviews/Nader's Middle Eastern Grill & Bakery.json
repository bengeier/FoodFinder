{"text":"Very disappointed in my 2nd visit..the first time I thought maybe bcz they are new their service and food is not good but I went there again after 3 months and exactly the same! Their service is horrible, the staff can not understand English properly nor have any customer service skills..the food was reheated(not fresh) meat is hardly marinated and overall the food quality and taste is below average..hope they realize that their non skilled staff and chefs can't keep the place running for too long."}
{"text":"I reluctantly revisited Nader's with a group in spite of my first experience (which I thought I had reviewed but cannot find on Yelp) because of its convenient location.

Unfortunately, the experience was not an improvement from my first. While the grilled food is tasty, the portion size is noticeably inferior to their competitors which also have lower pricing. (Please read my reviews of Kabab's in downtown Toronto).

Even more disappointing was the service. The first time I visited, it was simple ... the food order was made at the cash register and a server simply dropped off the food to our table. This time, we were told at the register that Nader's was a full service restaurant. 

The reality was that the service was dreadfully slow. The food took much too long to prepare and we had to ask numerous times for water. And the server could take a lesson in customer service 101. \"Please\", \"thank you\" and smiles go a long way in encouraging customers to come back.

Finally, I think the City of Mississauga should visit and consider whether their ventilation systems are sufficient for the space. As someone else noted, the restaurant is massive and the smoke from the grill is not being sufficiently pumped outside of the restaurant but rather seems to remain trapped in the cavernous restaurant. The result is that it's smokey in the restaurant and you leave with your clothes reeking of smoke."}
{"text":"Excellent food recommend to any one who seeks middle eastern cousine unlimited refilling drinks very amazing deal"}
{"text":"Yes the service is SLOW!  No, I've not been to Nader's for a sit down meal, however I read a review from a Mississauga Paper saying it had AMAZING FRIED CHICKEN, so I ordered  by phone and picked it up.  THe Fried Chicken is cooked to oreder so it does take a Approx 20 minutes to prepare and cook and it IS worth the wait.  Never seeing a review on here for the fired chicken I thought it would be worth mentioning.  It IS the best by far in the entire area!  Service is a big part of a restaurant and I can fully understand when people sitting for a a meal have crap service, as far as the food here it is quite good.  Ordering the Greek Salad with dressing on the side was great, fresh and HUGE!  There was no problem in ordering certain types of meat, whether you want dark, white, thighs or wings.  They are very accomodating.  

I can't stress enough how fab the fried chicken is, if you have a craving for proper Fried chicken, try it.  Crisp, the meat is very tender and marinated beforehand so it has flavor.  Well done indeed.  

HOWEVER!! the other day my wife dropped by to pick up some chicken on her way home from work.  The Restaurant was CLOSED!!!!   Does anyone know if it has shut down?  Are the owners away perhaps OR doing some small renovations?  SInce there was no sign saying what was happening, thought I'd check here and see if anyone knows.

Shame if it has Closed, the food was great.  Without good service no business can survive these days.  Was hoping they could turn it around before it was too late.  Hope they are just under a Small reno, fixing things and perhaps new management in the sevice part."}
{"text":"The food is great but the store is really dirty .. when I came in, most of the tables had food leftovers on them I had to move stuff and clean the table myself. Also it looks like no one ever vacuumed the floor or the restaurant. The food is alright but sometimes stuff like this could ruin the whole experience."}
{"text":"There's a reason why this huge restaurant has such few guests. Their service sucks. Do not go here if you're planning to take people out, you might just get told that you can't eat in because they are not busy enough stay open till the time they advertise. That is exactly what happened with us when we decided to come here for our family dinner. It ruined out evening. Even though their food is okay, the low level of service is just u acceptable"}
{"text":"worst food ever, worst service ever, big place for no reason, have to order and pay first then have to go grab your food, comparing to the price your paying its not worth it at all, you can go to the really small middle-eastern place for a WAY better food and service."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE Service!

The first time I went, the employees were rude and disrespectful. I asked for tap water and they said they dont serve tap water for health concerns....really? the second time i brought my own reusable water bottle, they said i couldnt bring it in....no outside food.... Money grab? DEFINITELY. I hope they collect as much as they can before they go bust. The food isnt good enough or cheap enough to tolerate their terrible service. It's a shame it was a good location."}
{"text":"We went here last week, and I am unsure of what their menu was suppose to be as they have everything on their from Tandoori (Pakistani/Indian/Afghan) to Arabic, to Persian and Turkish menu items as well as the Western items. If its suppose to be a fusion restaurant it failed at it with its lack of flavor in its food and failure to give what is ordered in its right form. I ordered the chicken breast plate with potatoes - maybe my expectations where off but I did not like the potatoes that came with the odd spicy sauce on them. The chicken was nothing more than average, and the afghan rice which was \"paloa\" or whatever when you order from an Indian/Pakistani place was not as tasty either. Their pita was fresh but nothing special. Overall, I don't know what their menu is suppose to be. I don't know why their prices are so high as they lack service levels and food quality. The place is quite spacious and reminded me of Paramount (another place I am not fond of revisiting for their lack of service and food quality with prices that don't serve their purpose). I traveled from Scarborough to Mississauga and was left very disappointed and attempted to leave quickly as possible after we ate."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad last year, I always order the mezze platter.  Went last week, man, this place has gone downhill.  They used to have nice homemade pita bread, now it's just dry, hard prepackaged crap.  Their potatoes were one of the.best I'd had, now just meh.  What a disappointment, that was definitely my last visit."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Ask politely for a condiment and they tell you to line up to pay for it.  Never been asked to pay for a condiment in Toronto my entire life.  Instead of just handing out a condiment to keep a customer happy and coming back, the manager wants to argue with the customer about their business model?"}
{"text":"Food 3/5
The food is actually not bad! Sometimes better, sometimes not so good.

Service 1/5
They are pretty cheap about the garlic sauce and we're giving an attitude when you asked more than once. Also they seem not very attentive because by the time we got our food, they still didn't bring the bread. They forgot about it and we had to ask for it, even though it was not busy at all.

Decor 4/5
It is actually really nice decorated and I had a good first impression. 

Facit: I used to come here a few times because paramount was a bit too far. But now that they opened one at Erin mills town centre, I will not come here again. The service in Paramount is much better and they are way more generous!"}
{"text":"This was the nastiest experience i have had. The floors were dirty with tissue paper and straw paper lying around in cornera, cutlery was not clean, tables were not wiped clean and had ketchup stains. Dirty boxes and trash can be seen underneath the counter if you are sitting across it in the dining area. Flies all over the place and tables not being cleaned as customers leave. To sum it up no sense of hygiene and wouldnt be surprised if someone gets sick."}
{"text":"The only positive thing I can say is that the staff are polite and courteous. 

I found this place because I was craving Chicken Tagine. Well the short version of my review is it is worth the drive into Toronto instead of coming here. 

I have read the other reviews about wait times and figured maybe it's because they made food fresh or the quality was great. Don't assume. So I waited about 20 minutes and got one of the saddest most pathetic meals I have ever been served in a restaurant. Firstly the chicken was cold. Like they threw it straight from the fridge into warm broth to warm it up so a couple of spots were warm but the rest was straight out of the fridge. I waited for 20 minutes and couldn't even get a hot meal. The chicken was also revolting. You know how chicken gets when you leave it soaking in water for a day or more... yeah that's what this was like. Slimey and gross. Probably wouldn't have been as revolting if it wasn't cold but still wouldn't have been good. In the entire tagine there was 1 olive. The couscous tasted like it was drown in butter. It was totally inedible. 

If you are thinking about coming here run, don't walk, as far away as possible. 

Also they are either too lazy or too cheap to properly maintain their washrooms."}
{"text":"The bakery section has excellent pastries: Some of the best Baklavas in the GTA west end.

However, the restaurant section is a failure: Prices are way too high for the quality of food & service. We ordered the Wazeri Kabab ($19), which consisted of Minced meat kabab & Chicken kabab. We ordered it with Afghan spiced rice & fries (yes Fries, because they didn't have many of the sides shown on their menu. We also ordered the Lamb Chops ($17) with Basmati rice drizzled with saffron & salad.

The cashier was a teenage girl, who didn't have much enthusiasm (no \"please\" or \"thank you\"), bordering on rudeness. The lone waiter was over worked, running around and definitely didn't have time to be efficient or polite.

Food .. This was probably the worst Middle Eastern food I've had in Canada. You are better off dining @ Afghan Kebab Cuisine, Bamian or BBQ Tonite.

Wazeri Kebab - Chicken and minced meat kebabs were dry and tasteless. Fries were soggy. Afghan spiced Rice was decent, but not as flavourful as expected.

Lamb chops - 3 small pieces of tough meat flavoured with little salt and cumin. Very bland and not enough to fill us up. The salad had no dressing. Waiter initially brought as plain rice. Upon complaint, he brought back the rice with saffron drizzled on it. Rice wasn't bad.

Condiments are sparse. If you still insist on dining here, make sure to pick up a free side of yoghurt dressing to give some flavour to the food. Their \"hot sauce\" is Frank's hot sauce: Vinegary.

I would not recommend the restaurant to anyone. If you like sweets, try the Bakery section. Cheers."}
{"text":"First time here. Dropped in after going to the Winners next door. Walking in, the place is huge and clean. Almost empty when I was there.

Girl taking order was aloof and looked as if she could care less. I ordered the shwarma plate for take out.
 
I was very disappointed upon opening my food up at home. It was mostly rice with a little bit of chicken shwarma on the top. The salad was just all iceberg with a lil bit of tabouli drizzled on the top. Looked nothing like what they had up on their signs. The meat was dry and tasted really old. The rice was very oily. 

Overall a very dissapointing experience. Might go back for baklava/gelato. They also have hookah for $12."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!
 
We went for a friend's birthday. It was a big group(about 11 people)

At one point by accident we spilled some water on the table. So we asked one of workers to help us wipe the table, she  said \"Oh, you need to find your waitress\" Well aren't you all co-workers. Can't you ask?? But whatever, we found and asked our waitress.

2) Waitress came with dirty rag and JUST LEFT IT on table, expected us to clean and said \"I will be back\".. you want us to wipe the table??? Anyways, we did  and she didn't even have courtesy to come back, we had to flag her down again.

3)Few of the dishes we requested specifically were vegetarian, due to dietary restrictions.  Instead, we got a Afghan rice with beef!! And we asked waitress, she is like oh yea,  I just found out rice has beef. Well if you did find out why are you NOT telling us??

They just gave us bunch of fries and potato instead.  Terrible food and overprices for quality of food and definitely not worth the service.

AND after still paid full price for crappy food AND person was standing write behind me expecting a TIP!"}
{"text":"The lamb tagine was horrible and the items are way overpriced I would not recommend. They should adjust their prices I spent almost 40$ and barely got anything for me and my family!"}
{"text":"I will start with the positive points the food is good We tried the shawarma , kabab , tikka and Tageen all came  in good portions and freshly made we liked it the Homos thou was not as good! The prices were OK slightly expensive but acceptable the lemonade with mint was for 14$ which I find expensive!
We liked the decorations and everything was clean ..
now as for the service it was really strange that there is no service on table like you have to go and get your food , your water you'r plats everything!! Which we find a bit strange we are not in a food court here it's a restaurant consider this point I find it hard to invite friends there as I have to handle  the service rather having a good time with them .. Having said that will definitely be eating there again but more as takeaway!"}
{"text":"I have been to Nader's, around 25  + times.  The bad reviews are valid with regards to service, but I mean its actually a good restaurant foodwise.

The service here is SOOOO SUCKY.  Mixing up orders all day!

and the hilarious part now is they don't offer a glass of water, you have to buy a bottle, so I guess the point of having a huge enormous restaurant and having fast food style service is what they are trying to do...so silly.

Always at least 3 -4 whole Islamic families eating here, which is nice to see families eating together. Really good to see preservation of culture and fam bonding.

The lamb is good, the afghan rice is good and naturally the baklava is good. I opt for the lentil soup when not too hungry and it is very good.

I really like the food here, maybe order and take out would be better. It is right near square one, so pretty convenient and ample parking."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because they have been improving in the service side and keeping the good flavour. 
The lentil soup has been always good reminding that I had in Istanbul, their bread is also very good. 
They have a section where you can have shisha which can be smelled in the whole restaurant. I would recommend to keep improving and pay more attention to the cleanliness of the place."}
{"text":"I've been a Nader's supporter ever since they opened. Their food is quite decent - pricy, especially for Middle Eastern takeout, but it tastes good. I often get the Chicken and Beef Shawarma Plate. Their salads are decent, but the rice, mixed meat shawarma, and the garlic sauce really does it for me. I'd definitely recommend this dish even though it's quite pricy - $12 I believe. 

Other items thats I've tried at Nader's include the Turkish pitas and the kebab plates. The Turkish pitas were decent, but I haven't had them enough to acquire a taste for them. The kebab plate, on the other hand, was really good. 

Moving on to the restaurant itself - everything about it just seems to be a little awkward. The space itself is very big and beautiful - everything is nicely decorated. However, it seems as if their restaurant is too big - the vast majority of their tables are always empty, and it gives the illusion that nobody ever eats there. Their menus are very poorly done (looks like I could've put them together in 10 minutes on MS Paint), and they use the numbering system akin to many fast food establishments. It just seems as if the whole restaurant lacks a firm direction. 

Lastly, just wanted to debunk the claim that they don't serve tap water and force you to buy their bottles. I'm not sure how they handled this earlier in 2013, but I went just last month and they brought a whole jug to my table. 

Overall: check the place out, have a chicken and beef shawarma plate, you (most likely) won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Considering there are plenty of kebab restaurants opening everywhere in the westend of GTA, I am very disappointed in Nader.  I was looking forward to this place opening some time ago.  It finally did and I was impressed by the size of the place.  It was promising.  The food was pretty good.

The downfall of this place?  BAD MANAGEMENT!  

They can't seem to figure out whether they are a cafeteria style or a sit down.  They started cafeteria style.  Then their price went up and all of a sudden they're a sit down.  Months later, the restaurant didn't seem to increase in patrons and I visited and all of a sudden, they no longer serve tap water.  When I spoke to the manager, she said, they technically do not have to serve tap water.  An obvious money grabbing technique.  I promised myself livid of this that I would never return.

However, one night with my husband, parents and children we found ourselves there once again.  We stood in front of a sign that said \"Please wait to be seated.\"  Staff passing by in an empty restaurant and not one of them came to seat us.  Alright...almost 10min later, a staff passes by \"Can I help you?\"  ....uhhhh... \"We're waiting to be seated?\"  Well here's his wonderful response, \"Oh you have to order your food from the front and then seat yourself.\"  Well then...I indicated that they should remove this sign by the door then.

Starving family in an empty restaurant, I stood behind a couple who are ordering for what seems like 30people.  Individual orders...for take out.  I stood there for another 10 min waiting for this couple to figure out what they were ordering.  Meanwhile, about 5 staff members stood behind and in front of the counter twiddling their thumbs.  Finally, I interrupted and asked...\"Is there anyway to make an order for sit in?\"  Manager arrives...(same manager with the water debacle) \"Oh, I can help you here!\"  Well then....

That was the end of that.  Never again Nader.  It is unfortunate, you will not survive.  You need to hire a proper manager who will run the place better.  Let go of that manager!  She's terrible!"}
{"text":"Haven't been there before, but there must have been some significant improvements since the terrible reviews. Had the lamb with basmati rice and both were seasoned well. Not dry at all. Also bought an assortment of baked goods on the way out which were quite scrumptious. The baklava had just the right amount of sweetness, not drowning in sugar hurts your teeth like some other places I've tried. My only concern about the place is how huge it is, they might have bitten off more than they can chew with a location 3x as large as they need it to be. They'll need some better advertising and good word of mouth to fill such a large space."}
{"text":"this place is huge and good to go with huge group.

Food is mediocre, however service and welcoming attitude of the owner and waiters was very refreshing. We went to this restaurant with group of 30 people and at the end was offered free tea for every one, tea was freshly made.

Will go back."}
{"text":"I really like this place! We had chicken and beef shawarma couple of times and we really enjoyed it. Place if spacious and clean, staff is friendly. I will definitely come back for another shawarma:)"}
{"text":"Boring, bland, reheated rice and chicken shawarma.  Shawarma consists of poorly marinated and underseasoned gristly dark meat.  Waitresses unwilling to do any type of substitutions or changes to your meal.

And flat out refusing to serve ice water to a dine-in guest is downright greedy and ridiculous.  \"Nader\" the owner's idiotic response to another diner on a different website is that \"they don't allow serving tap water due to health concerns\"

Since when is Peel Region's water a health concern to consume?  Where is that a concern ANYWHERE in Canada?  Give me a break.  More concerning than the state of our water is your desire to squeeze your dine-in customers for every last red cent..

Been twice, gave it 2 shots.  That's enough for me.  Won't be back, and definitely will not recommend it.  Probably why the place is the size of a high school gymnasium yet only ever has 2 tables occupied.."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night at 9. They said they closed early. Hours are till 11. Very unprofessional . Never again."}
{"text":"I've never had a pleasant experience in this place. Other than the fact that the service is slow and the food is below average, the shisha, which is the same price as Haze, mind you, is always messed up! I have to call someone to fix it at least twice before I can smoke it, and even then there's barely any smoke coming out. I think it's the cheap disposable hoses they use, but either way, this place is a waste of time. If you want proper shisha head to Haze Lounge or Shishalicious, but don't waste your time/money here."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time around lunch.  Checked the other reviews and they mentioned that the service is not great.  I was attended to within 1 minute of lining up to place my order. 

Waiting for the order was another thing though, I wanted about 13 minutes to get a plate which is really long compared to places like Villa Madina. The hummus was a bit salty for me but maybe others like it that way. The pita that came with the plate was freshly made, I think they bake it when you order so that was good.

The portion was enough to make me full.  I would come again but only if I am not pressed for time because this place was slow even though it was dead inside. 

A little pricey compared to other middle eastern places but it is quiet in there."}
{"text":"Seems like complaints about the service here are pretty common but I'd just like to add my two cents from my own bad experience because I've honestly never encountered anything like it before.
Basically I went in with a friend, we sat down, had a look at the menu and picked out what we were going to get. When the waitress came over we gave her our orders and asked for waters to drink. She then asked if we wanted bottled water, we told her no, tap water was fine, and she said they didn't serve tap water and you had to buy the bottled water.

A restaurant that doesn't serve water?? Needless to say we got up and walked right out.

The whole situation was unfortunate because I'd been there once before and had a great burger, and there were no issues, water-related or otherwise. So instead of me continuing to enjoy the place and recommending it to friends, they lost that business over a glass of tap water."}
{"text":"Their service was great. I was walking towards the cashier to make my order, but she was leaving her position. Another off swift employee saw me waiting and he quickly came by to do cash in less than 20 sec.

I took my receipt and wait for them to call out my order number. However, the waiting time was kind of slow. I wished it could be a little bit faster, but I think it is because they cooked each dish for each order.

Their tagine was quite huge and it came with a plate of rice. It could easily shared with another person. I liked their rice a lot. It has some spices or herbs to it. Their deep fried chicken was not bad with their special seasoned fries too. The fries were hot and tasted great with ketchup. The tandoori chicken was not bad as well. The salad on the tandoori chicken was fresh. The tandoori chicken was juicy.

The price is kind of expensive but remember the portion is huge and could be share. I would go back again for their middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Bad food...worse service!

The venue is truly beautiful and this place had all the potential to be something special. It's a shame the same attention to detail that went into the ambience did not go into getting good staff or creating good food for that matter...

I've been here a handful of times. The Turkish pidas were rather good. As for the dishes from the grill, they leave a lot to be desired at their prices. I'd take paramount over this place any day..."}
{"text":"I have never actually sat down at this restaurant but we had take out from here several times. The restaurant is large, with many tables. Usually, pretty empty. There's a reason for that though. Read on...

The food is not bad but the service really makes it hard for us to want to go back to this place. Even if there are only 2-3 people in front of you, it still takes for-bloody-ever to get your food. We even tried calling in to place an order for pick up. They say the order will be ready in 20 minutes and we STILL had to wait an extra 20 minutes. It's ridiculous.

We've given Nader's Grill many chances and they blew every single one of them. Unless they fire their whole stuff, we're not going back."}
{"text":"Been with the family a few time, great looking restaurant pretty big perfect for group of 12+. The food is alright at best  the service is non-existent . If you can'5 get a large group into a better restaurant go to this one"}
{"text":"Poor service. Actually, zero service. Its a do it yourself restaurant.. like a high school cafeteria. Very inconsistent. Useless for \"dining in\".. But they charge dine-in pricing.
You have to stand and wait in line to order your food, then you have to pick up your food when they call your number. Nobody will check on you, ever. If you want desert or coffee, you again need to stand in line (a different line where there's nobody attending, pay again. This place is ridiculous.  Food quality is about a 6 out of 10. Sometimes a 7."}
{"text":"terrible service, food did not come in time and was left on the counter as servers talked to one another. Bread was delayed and when notified the manager - he just walked away and did nothing to remedy the situation. Server touched the glasses inside with fingers, and did not give us water when we repeatedly asked for it. Food was great, but there were other tables walking out because the service was just so damn awful.  I have never been in a restaurant that was just so plain bad at being full service. They should go back to self-serve buffet style, incompetent. 

Again, food was great - service was horrifically bad."}
{"text":"HALAL

I'm on the fence with this place. The food is not Middle Eastern. It seems their menu has a mix of Turkish food or Afghani food as well.

We ordered food to go and the food is tasty. When I can't classify the culture of the food I don't know what to say about it. 

It was good nonetheless."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened a few years ago, and the food is always on point. The tandoori chicken plate was perfect & you don't have to tip anyone since there's no waiters. Check this place out for yourself."}
{"text":"Overall not bad. Menu is extensive so you will have a hard time choosing one thing. We stopped in here by chance as we were shopping in the area. The place is huge and when we went it was not very busy. We ordered a burger and fries. I know it is not your typical Middle Eastern meal but we were craving a burger and the patties are made fresh, plus the cashier recommended it. The service was VERY slow. Only one guy cooking and prepping all the food. Although it was not busy we ended up waiting 15-20 minutes - waaaay too long in my opinion. The burger tasted pretty good and the fries were so so. I would definitely go back and try a traditional plate in the future."}
{"text":"The ABSOLUTE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!! 
I've been here before and have had better service but this visit surpasses all. 
I don't know even know where to start. 

My friend and I stopped by Sunday evening after a long shift. After looking forward to some shawarma, to our disappointment they'd been out of beef shawarma since the morning! I wanted the chicken tangine with couscous since I'd liked it last time I tried it. 
I almost fell over when my total came up to $24 for a tangine, water and hummus. 
After waiting for 20m I was called to the front only to be served a massive plate of rice. I asked where my couscous was to which they responded, \"oh we don't have any\". I asked why no one had told me when I order and the boy working said \"I don't know. It wasn't me.\" I was baffled, a woman stepped in saying that she would treat us to Nutella bites. 
The Nutella pockets arrived luke warm and they were super slimy when we bit into them. After biting into another, RAW DOUGH BURST OUT OF THE POCKET! After opening the pocket, we discovered that they were COMPLETELY RAW. I showed this to the man and he said that was how the pockets were served. He offered me a $5 refund out of my $24 and even argued with me at the cash for about 10m. 
I WILL NEVER RETURN AND WILL BE TELLING ALL OF MY MISSISSAUGA CLIENTS TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. 
Can't wait to see this place go under. It's only a matter of time with standards like those.  
As for the food, the chicken was the toughest most rubbery chicken I'd ever encountered. The rice was SO over cooked that it would dissolve in your mouth. You'd never know it was a grain. It was flavourless and disappointing. I can't even bring myself to eat the massive untouched portion I brought home. 
Going to Naders was a waste of my money and my Sunday evening!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner for the first time. We had a great experience. The food came out fresh and quick. Everything tasted very good. The pricing was very decent. I will definitely go there again. It is a good place To go with family."}
