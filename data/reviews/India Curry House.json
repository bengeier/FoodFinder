{"text":"Excellent food! Was surprised how good the quality was. Great place to order take out from. Butter chicken and garlic fish dishes are amazing. Look forward to trying out more"}
{"text":"Good food but service is just worst service i have ever seeen. They should hire some staff who knows how to handle a restaurant not family members"}
{"text":"we have eaten here for some time and generally good. the problem is there has been a new owner or staff turnover and they are NOT NICE! we order take out and every time for the past 6 times we went for the food they would be swearing at us and laughing, little did they know that I fully understand what they were saying!!  Mainly it was the young girl at the front desk who would instigate the comments with the other female counter staff.  I would NOT suggest going there, there are better restaurants where you don;t have to tolerate this type of arrogance."}
{"text":"First time my wife and I got some take out. Food was excellent we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place used to be my fave neighborhood haunt. Went this last Friday and we ordered the prawn masala only to get served the baby white tiny shrimp that they use for the tom yum soup! Asked the waitress and she said she didn't know the difference between shrimp and prawn...umm lots...eg the price! The grill platter was very tasty. The lamb briyani a big disappointment... Rice soggy and tiny pieces of lamb...like they had taken one piece and cut it into many tiny pieces. So disappointed!!! New ownership and a high staff turnover may have to do with it."}
{"text":"Food excellent; service h o r r I b l e ! The Chinese biryani, unusual and tasty. Don't know to make a bacardi & coke"}
{"text":"I love their saag, with no paneer, with garlic naan. The saag is full of greens and delicious Indian spices. Not too spicy. I love this option because it's vegetarian. The service is not great, so I prefer the take out option."}
