{"text":"I don't quite understand the love/hate reactions this place.  I wanted to love it, because my friend who lives in Coventry does.  But we got take-out from there, and I thought it was certifiably bad.  I didn't even want to finish.  I got basic dishes - spring rolls and veggie pad thai.  It always amazes me when fried spring rolls are tasteless.  I mean, they're fried!  You're starting off so ahead of the game there.  The pad thai was also just really bland and flavorless.  I might be a bit of a snob about Thai food, having eaten many phenomenal meals in Thailand and having visited Thai restaurants around the world (often my first choice in capital cities).  But I think I'm forgiving.  I've had lots of versions of pad thai that did not resemble pad thai at all, but they were still good.  I can accept that.  But Mint Cafe just served up a bad dish.  I'd say it was a one-off, except that I see so many others had the same experience.  Maybe the other dishes, like the curries, are better, but personally I'm not going to bother to find out.  If you're a Thai restaurant that can't make pad thai, you lose in my book.  Also, I ordered the veggie pad thai with just vegetables.  And instead I got it with tofu.  That is a pet peeve of mine - just because I don't want meat does not mean I want tofu.  I was clear about this in my order, and it still got screwed up.  This is not a fatal flaw, I can just pick the tofu out.  But it was just another strike against Mint.  Go to Lemongrass.  I've been going there for years now and they are consistent with the Thai basics."}
{"text":"Mint Cafe is my favorite Thai restaurant in Cleveland, hands down. Their noodle dishes are excellent, all of the ones I've tried -- especially the country-style pad thai, crazy noodles and jade noodles. The curries are superb as well, and my mother-in-law swears by the Tamarind Duck. Care is taken with presentation as well, and the food always looks beautiful. What's more, the prices are pretty affordable given how tasty and well-presented the food is.   We're pretty addicted to the bubble tea there, too; theirs is the best! Try the Thai iced tea flavored bubble tea."}
{"text":"If I was writing this review five years ago it would have been five stars, easy.    However, now that I'm spending time in Cleveland Heights again and have had the opportunity to revisit some of my old haunts, I have to say that Mint Cafe has been severely disappointing.    I have recently sampled the Basil Fried Rice, Pad Thai and Vegetable Dumpling soup.  The Fried Rice and the Pad Thai were both too sweet and kind of underwhelming.  The Vegetable Dumpling soup was very bland and I can't be sure if what was inside the dumpling was actually vegetable-related at all.  Maybe chicken?  It was had to tell, because there was really no flavor to speak of.  I am being generous with three stars, due to my past affection for this restaurant.  I have high hopes that these dishes were flukes and not indicative of everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good service and authentic Thai food. A fun place on Coventry to grab a meal with friends at an inexpensive price. I have not left here disappointed since moving back from NY."}
{"text":"I dunno if everything is good here.  But I do know that at least one thing here is AMAZING. I've been here probably 15 times, and I only get Thai basil. Ground chicken, onion, pepper, deep-fried basil with a nice basil-y sauce, and white rice. If you're not salivating yet, you should be."}
{"text":"i'm going to have to agree with previous posters that mint cafe is great. after my first visit, i truely worried about mint cafe and her welfare, for anyone who has spent the last 4 years in cleveland hts knows that that corner has bad karma (not referring to the previous restaurant 'karma', but the fact that restaurants don't stay in business..) but i think based on crowdedness and awesomeness, mint cafe may be there to stay. i'd like to say i love everything on the menu, but i honestly can't order anything else besides the drunken noodles because it is s.o. g.o.o.d...."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. Portions are manageable and food is very fresh. Definitely a step above other Thai places I have tried in the Heights."}
{"text":"I get the red curry with tofu every god damn time I'm there and it's excellent, so my review is based on that. The other stuff must be good too but I'm a weirdo and don't want to risk it!"}
{"text":"I could eat my weight in Thai food. And I'm a big guy.   That being said, if I had my choice of places to eat 250 lbs of Pad Thai, this would be the place. Deeee-Licious."}
{"text":"Actually the food is better than most thai restaurants in Cleveland. If you go there, you must get the bubble tea. They have a very good one. I personally like the spicy tom yum goon. If you not afraid of spicy food, then get it. They also have a good selection of noodles and curry dishes. This place has country thai phai. Its very good and delicious."}
{"text":"Five stars are NOT enough to describe how mouth wateringly AMAZING Mint Cafe is!  I live in Atlanta and have been to what this city claims to be the best Thai food around... and NO Thai restaurants have yet come CLOSE to Mint  Cafe.  I would say, hands down, Mint Cafe is the best Thai Restaurant in the entire world!!!    (On a side note... I would suggest trying the Pad Thai (Country Style optional), Coconut Soup, Thai Iced Tea, and Brown Rice + Panang Curry)"}
{"text":"I've been frequenting the Mint Cafe on Coventry for something like 5 years, and every visit is impeccable.  The bubble tea is outstanding, as is the tempura and soups. Their entrees never seem to miss the mark. Especially considering the reasonable cost of everything on their menu, you really can't seem to go amiss here.  Also awesome is their staff - super friendly and pleasant. I have left other restaurants in Coventry for poor service, just to wander down the street and have a perfect evening at Mint Cafe."}
{"text":"The Mint Cafe, is OK......   Food was beautifully presented (we had the lady in green salmon which truly looks like art :0, veggie pad thai, and scallop eggplant) and had lots of fresh veggies, which is a real plus....   Also, they served large portions, which bordered on enormous in the case of the veggie pad Thai.  The food is nooooootttt spicy here, which depending on your view is either a plus or in my case a minus.  I thought the  veggie pad thai was unbelievably bland and neither of the two main dishes was spicy either which made the flavor of the curry off (too sweet, no spice - they eliminated something I think!!!!)"}
{"text":"Authentic and excellent.  I like penang gai (curry chicken), the tom yum kun (shrimp broth), and salmon."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I was starving so I probably would have given the Jimmy John's down the street a great review too. But this place was very good.  The service was excellent. Everyone was really nice and kept at it with the water.  We had some Siam rolls (spring rolls) and edamame to start. The spring rolls were tasty and had a good sweet-and-sour sauce, but they were a little too small and a bit harder than I would have liked. There were five of them, however, and they came out piping hot. The edamame was perfect, which I guess isn't hard to do, but when it's done wrong, it sucks. So I was happy with the fact that they were tender, warm, and lightly salted.  I had the Pad Thai, which was plentiful and came with both shrimp and chicken. It had a nice amount of egg, and a bunch of ground peanuts on top. It was really good, but a tiny bit too sweet.  My husband had the Thai-style basil chicken and went nuts at the fried basil. He loved it.  He also appreciated the way that the chicken was minced, which is apparently \"the way it's supposed to be\" for this dish(the reality? He has no clue but likes to pretend he does. Ha ha.).  I just liked the overall feel of this restaurant. It wasn't fancy but that's how I like it. I'm glad that we decided to walk in here when there were a lot of other options on Coventry that we could have easily tried."}
{"text":"WOOOO MINT CAFE!  This place is sooo good! Definitely affordable if you're looking to be satisfied every time you go. The presentation is fantastic and I've never had a problem here. The service is great and you'll never go without water!  I'll admit, I like trying new things, but I canNOT stop getting the Pineapple Chicken here! It's just so good! I can't resist warm pineapple!  Other good stuff: Mango anything, spring rolls, soft shell crab, limeade, and pad thai...pretty much anything I've eaten here."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Excellent service.  Super friendly people who welcome you and send you on your way with a smile on their faces.  Hands down the best potstickers we've ever had--the layers of flavors were apparent and they were downright delicious.  Crazy noodles and Pad Thai were super yummy.  This is our new favorite place.  Mint Cafe is head and shoulders above Ty Fun in Tremont and I thought Ty Fun was the best Thai I had found in Cleveland.  Now Mint Cafe is!  Rock on."}
{"text":"If you like Thai food this place is flavorful and consistent. The service is usually good enough to make it enjoyable. Go there!"}
{"text":"I adore Thai food, and this restaurant is excellent.  Best pad thai I have found in Cleveland hands down.  Lemongrass' pad thai is too bland, Mekong River is too greasy.  But this small restaurant makes wonderful thai food.  Very reasonable prices, friendly staff.  A great find.  I highly recommend it to anyone else looking for great pad thai."}
{"text":"Delicious. I've been here several times and consider it a treat to myself when I go. Mint Cafe has never disappointed. It is some of the best Thai food I have ever had. The mango-rice-coconut milk dessert is heaven on a plate."}
{"text":"This thai place just opened this year but it is REALLY really tasty. The menu offers your typical items such as padthai and curries, but there is something for everyone here. The fried eggroll with banana and chocolate is very tasty! The service is extremely friendly. I have always left Mint Cafe with a full belly and a smile. For thai, it is a little more expensive than average so expect to spend about 10-15 dollars per dish."}
{"text":"Mint Cafe is back after being closed for a little while.. It think it was a lot better before it closed.  Their beef satay with peanut sauce and sweet chili sauce is pretty good.  The beef is soft and tender, nicely grilled with char marks on the edges.  The beef almost melts in your mouth.  It's delicious with the peanut sauce; however, the peanut sauce is a little too sweet for me.    I also got their country pad thai.  It was full of chicken and tofu, a little light on the shrimp though.  The shrimp was soft and slightly mushy when it should be firm.  It wasn't the best pad thai I have ever had, but not the worst.  The sauce overly sweet for my taste.  The spice level was perfect though.    It was moderately priced for the meal I got- 16.00 for the whole check.  I will definitely go back and try it again, but I won't get the pad thai next time!  Everyone seems to love the curry- so I'll try that next time!"}
{"text":"A wonderful little treasure tucked in a corner of the Coventry Road area, The Mint Cafe is a Thai restaurant that offers a fragrant variety of curries, rices and other wonderful fare for both the carnivore or the ardent vegetarian.   Their meals are wonderful from appetizers through the main dishes right down their tasty and exotic desserts (the banana spring rolls are a personal favorite of my wife and I:) The service is great and the atmosphere is nice and intimate.   They also have a nice selection of drinks from Lassi's (the drink, not the pooch:) to tasty bubble teas and other fine fare.  Parking is available down the street, and then you have access to all of Coventry's wonderful stores. Truly, a great way to spend an evening with friends or a way to treat your significant other to a special evening out.  NOTE: TODAY, JAN 4, 2011, SADLY, WE FOUND OUT THAT MINT CAFE IS PERMANENTLY CLOSED FOR SOME STRANGE, UNKNOWN REASON. THEY RECOMMENDED GOING TO ONE OF THEIR SISTER RESTAURANTS LIKE PEPPERMINT CAFE. IF ANYONE FINDS OUT WHY THIS WONDERFUL PLACE CLOSED, PLEASE, LET ME KNOW."}
{"text":"This place had really good Thai food.  Their pad thai was great along with the bubble tea.  Their thai currys are excellent.   It was over a bit overpriced though.  Portions were also small and they charge for extra white rice..  I would go down the street to Tree- Country.  Bigger portions for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"So far I've been to Mint Cafe 2 times and both times I have really enjoyed my food. Now granted, I've ordered the same thing both times, but that's because the 2nd time I went there it was specifically to eat that very dish!!    You might be wondering of what dish does she speak? Well, I'll tell you... the Under the Sea with noodles and yellow curry instead of the red that they have listed on the menu. It is delicious. Their portions are big and they are very generous with the ingredients. So often Thai places will list a shrimp dish w/noodles or rice and then give you copious amounts of noodles or rice and maybe 3 or 4 shrimp...not Mint Cafe. The Under the Sea dish comes with shrimp (at least 4), salmon, calamari, and scallops (I counted 5 last time - I'm a total scallop whore) I know this may sound a bit picky but if I'm going to pay $13 for a seafood dish, I want there to be seafood in my dish - Don't scrimp on the shrimp I like to say! (That's not true, I've never said that in my life, but it fits)  Moving past the visions of seafood dancing in my head, I have not eaten at Mint alone and would like to mention the other dishes enjoyed by my friends. A friend ordered the pad thai and gave it thumbs up (hard to screw up pad thai, but it has been done) another friend ordered the duck and gave it rave review and my boyfriend ordered some Fairy Tale Dream or something that consisted of chicken, cashews, pineapple and various other yummy bits. No one had any complaints and almost every plate was appropriately licked clean (figuratively not literally)   The decor is cute, not posh or chic by any means but that doesn't detract from the experience. They have a full bar and a decent wine list. There are other 'charming' characteristics such as blatant misspellings on the menu.  Does anyone want Desert? (Dessert) ...Or a glass of orange jice? (juice)  I will be back to Mint Cafe."}
{"text":"For those who say this is the best thai food in the Greater Cleveland area, you have to try Charm Thai (esp. their country style pad thai) in Broadview Heights.    I expected more from Mint, our group ordeed several noodle dishes (Jade noodles, country style pad thai and vegetarian pad thai).  I can only talk about the Jade noodles, however my dish was oily and lacked flavor.  It tasted like they just took cooked noodles, stirred in some mild sauce, some cooked shrimp and tofu and plopped it on a plate.  The onions didn't even have any color to them!  The only thing preventing me from giving Mint 1 star was their golden bag appetizer which was an interesting twist on a shrimp purse, however the contents of the purse was spongy and tasted like it was cooked from frozen.    I ordered their thai iced tea, which is usually fail proof.  Unfortunately their tea was watered down and did not utilize true half and half or condensed milk- so it got even more watered down.  Would not consider going to Mint again.  Ill stick with Charm Thai- its in the burbs' but it's the most authentic thai in the area."}
{"text":"I love to come here and eat! I often crave the tofu pad thai and tofu green curry."}
{"text":"Definitely not bad. The price point is fair and the decor is classic 1990's Thai restaurant feel -- with earth-tone of a lighter heft.  The flavours are mild for thai -- I'd prefer a little more punch.  We asked for authentic hot, and got non-existent spicyness.  I'm going to have to do a little more exploring to determine my favourite Thai venue, but this place isn't too bad.  Service was brisk and almost brusque -- but that's okay, right?"}
{"text":"I go visit Cleveland about once a month. Every time I visit I must go eat there! Totally love this place. I have visited Thailand before, the curries are very similar to what you can find in Thailand here in Mint Cafe.  LOVE EVERYTHING in there :) The Thai ice tea is good. The fried rice is pretty awesome. Try the curries too! Green Curry!  The place is small but neat and quiet. And you can choose your own spice level. In my opinion things aren't all that spicy if you can handle jalapeno.Waiting to go back again!"}
{"text":"I am a bit biased, as one of the people who works here is a close friend of mine. That said, this Thai food is still really excellent, and by far the best I have found in Cleveland, making Coventry a new destination spot for good and inexpensive Asian food with the triumvirate of Mint Cafe, Pacific East, and Coventry Hunan.  Do you know when Thai food is good?  It is when you are eating the curry, and you have eaten all the meat and vegetables that were in the curry dish, but you still put more rice on your plate, just so you can smother the rice with the sauce.  Mint Cafe reaches this level of Thai food, and I will definitely be going back.  While you are there, try the Jasmine Lime drink, it is so good and refreshing!"}
{"text":"The food is good,and reasonably priced. Service is good. Place is kind of cramped up. Interior is boring.  Overall,  I was not fully satisfied as if something was missing. May be I have had chances to go to some better thai placecs and I kept comparing them. Overall Average."}
{"text":"Cleveland is a city unusually resplendent with authentically delicious Thai food and choosing between these restaurants is for the most part a scenario where you cannot lose. Yet amidst these viable contenders there is leader of the pack who pulling ahead and rounding the final curve to victory. in this reviewer's opinion, the winner by a nose ahead of tree country and  a full length beyond lemon grass is The Mint Cafe.      The Jasmine rice forms a base for almost any meal, setting it a mile beyond a more mundane fried-fare. The various selections of curry are delicious without exception, although the real show-stopper is the mango curry with shrimp. Its an ideal mixture of hot and sweet, almost tropical. The the closest I've come time a parallel experience was in El Salvador spice and mango thrive although without the milkiness of coconut found here.     I'm not a slave to an over-bloated belly, but i found the servings to be more than satisfying, with enough flavor that I would still be scraping my plate had I eaten ten times as much.    Eating out is always a gamble, with too many variables to make any one place a sure thing. That being said, there is no feeling in the world like backing a winner."}
{"text":"A Coventry gem.   The food at the Mint Cafe is absolutley wonderful. It's light yet filling and very delicious. The service is very attentive, friendly, and knowledgable of the dishes on the menu.  I have yet to have a dish here I did not like nor have I had one I was able to finish. The Pad Thai Country style is my favorite dish so far followed in a close second by any of the curries. It is very reasonably priced and great for lunch or dinner. Definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"To die for food - Coventry Road Madness and the Pad Thai are two of my favorite dishes. Fantastic bubble tea!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really exicted to come here. I was slightly dissappointed.   The thai iced coffee was great! The spring rolls were so-so. The pad thai was not as good as I wanted it to be. Maybe I was just in a bad mood.   The food came out fast, and the waitress was extremely pleasant.  The bathrooms were close to clean.   There was a lot of variety on the menu. I just was not as crazy about the place as I thought it would be. I have definatly had better pad thai. And I wanted it to be more spicy."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Cleveland hands down.    Great Vegetable Tempura and Yellow Curry.   Recently moved from DC and found this is the only place comparable to some of the places we used to go.    I would eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG, like, OMG!  This place is great - great food, great presentation, generally enthusiastic service.  My favorite appetizer is the Golden Bags (don't laugh, they're named perfectly in earnest, and they're tasty. Golden Bags are pretty, too).  My favorite dishes here are the basil friend chicken, a salmon dish that I think is called Lady in Green, I don't think I've met a Mint Cafe curry that I didn't like, either."}
{"text":"Loved their red curry! Although the duck was more fat than meat. Heard they went out of business though? (Thats what their voicemail said!)"}
{"text":"I recently tried this out with some more newbies to the Mint. All of us liked the dishes we ordered.  I got great veggie rolls and the tofu curry. The curry isn't really juicy like I'm used to but great flavor. I liked that there was a good amount of tofu. Sometimes you wish people would give you lots, well Mint does! The peppers and green beans were cooked to perfect crisp bites. I fully enjoyed my food. No doubt at all.  The service was very nice and efficient. A+"}
{"text":"My food was just ok when i went yesterday. The service was pretty lame. Our server barely uddered a word and made us seem like we were bothering her by being there. (we were the only people in the restaurant). I had a tofu curry that was just ok. i would probably give it another shot and try one of their signature dishes."}
{"text":"I'm a novice when it comes to Thai food, but I have eaten my share of Thai in Cleveland. I can definitely say that Mint Cafe is the best of the bunch in the city. It's my go-to for take-out on Coventry and the portions you get for the price are rather abundant. They use huge shrimp in the pad thai and the tofu and chicken chunks are always cooked perfectly. If you're in the Coventry neighborhood, make this place a priority."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.    For tastier and spicier at the same price poing I would head up Cedar Rd and check out Lemongrass on Lee Rd."}
{"text":"My friends in Cleveland are HUGE fans of this place. I was really glad that I got the chance to check it out while I was there. It's a really nice atmosphere that seems sophisticated, but its still a casual dining place. The servers are really friendly and great. The food is delicious, portions are great and the price is fantastic."}
{"text":"Having grown up around delicious Thai restaurants, I was very impressed by Mint Cafe.  The wait wasn't long, service was good, and the prices were fair.  The Panang curry had a tasty kick to it.  I was told that duck works well with red curries and I've definitely been sold.  Their Pad Thai noodles had a great consistency and a good amount of peanutty flavor.  Their chicken pineapple dish was a perfect blend of sweet and salty.  All of these dishes are great for family style eating and take-out.  Even writing about Mint Cafe is making me crave Thai food.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good and comes out SO FAST. I am impressed! I don't have to pay the meter in the garage for more than 40 min.  My favoritie dish here is the Massaman Curry with Shrimp. Oh sweet potato and roasted peanuts...so divine.  Pad Thai is sweet but I like it that way.  The portions are perfect.  Only gripe about this place is that a waitress once told me I didn't tip enough (and I sure did- and isn't tip supposed to be optional anyway?). She asked for more and I didn't think that was very classy!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this was ever given 2 stars as a rating. It is so not! The food is amazing....to the point where if you weren't sitting in a public place, you would pick that plate up and just lick the sauce off of it, savoring every last taste. Try the mango curry with pork (or your preferred meat)."}
{"text":"Our first stop on a weekend trip to Cleveland!  The pad thai is totally rave worthy.  The perfect taste of sweet, sour, and spicy.  Some of the absolute best I have ever had.    Our basil tofu was just ok while our bowls of tom yum soup were extremely disappointing.  Fantastic service and cute location.  The interior needs a little updating, but charming all the same."}
{"text":"Mint Cafe was a wonderful restaurant when it existed.  It has now been replaced by a new restaurant called High Thai'd, run by a new owner.  Many of the menu items are the same and have simply been renamed (i.e., Mint Cafe Fried Rice is now High Thai'd fried rice).  The dishes are prepared in exactly the same way, and are priced the same.  However, disappointingly, some of the best items that used to be on Mint Cafe's menu have conspicuously disappeared (e.g. the Golden Bags).  The previous owners of Mint Cafe have another restaurant in Pepper Pike called Peppermint Thai Cuisine (which is unfortunately half an hour away).  Rating for Mint Cafe: 5 stars Rating for High Thai'd: 3 stars"}
{"text":"I went here the other day with a friend and had the country pad thai.  The noodles were ok, but the chicken and tofu were dry, and it was slightly bland.  I tried a mango smoothie with tapioca too, and while the tapioca \"bubbles\" were pretty good, the mango, while made with real fruit, was also bland because the mangoes themselves weren't very ripe.  In all, I'd say it was a pretty mediocre meal."}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai restaurant, hands down! In either Cleveland OR Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Cleveland. More attention to detail of spicing and flavors than some of other places, though the portions do seem slightly smaller. Vegetarian friendly. Brown rice available (and served in rather, um, unusual cone-shaped configurations). It's a busy place so expect a wait especially on the weekends. Be sure to feed the meter -- Cleveland Heights traffic cops don't kid around."}
{"text":"Mint Cafe is one of my favorite places to eat in Coventry.  I'm a fried rice fiend, and they put together some pretty quality dishes.  The restaurant looks small from the outside, but is actually very nice inside.  The staff is extremely friendly and courteous.  The put up with us even as we brought instrument cases into the small restaurant.  The prices are right at the location is great.  Give it a try if you're walking along Coventry road, and your not in the mood for burgers and wings."}
{"text":"Hrm. I've been pretty disappointed with Asian cuisine around Cleveland, but Mint Cafe is pretty good.  Started off the dinner with my thai tea. Man, was I craving a thai tea. It was okay, but did its duty to definitely wake me up after a long day. I chose the Mango Curry, per recommendation of our smiley waiter. Man, he was constantly smiling... maybe he was overly happy to see us? Nonetheless, he sure was friendly.   The mango curry was okay. It had chicken, shrimp, squash, and other veggies. The size of it was not the biggest...and it.. wasn't spicy. :P I kind of wish it had more kick. I did enjoy the mangoes though. My friend liked the pad thai.   Not super authentic dishes, but if you're having that semi-thai food crave, definitely stop by mint. I would stop by here again... it's your a-ok.."}
{"text":"Mint Cafe is the best Thai food in Cleveland - sorry Asian Grille in Lakewood!  I recommend the Mint Garden Chicken (nice steamed vegetables and chicken with an amazing peanut sauce on the side), the Crazy Noodle (Bangkok-style flat rice noodles with a spicy peanutty sauce), the Pumpkin Curry (a seasonal special), or the Yellow Curry.  Always very friendly service, family-friendly and reasonably group-friendly.    They also have great appetizers, like the edamame, tofu triangles and the crispy spring rolls.  They have some more expensive dishes, but many of the dinner entrees are less than $10.  Great food, reasonable prices, nice atmosphere, and friendly service.  For the guy who said there was no parking, there is a huge parking garage just one block down the street behind Marc's."}
{"text":"So, we decided to finally check out this place after the Honda dealership person told us this is 'home of the best Taiwanese food. 'LOL! Yes, and I speak Asian.  We ordered a noodle dish, a rice dish and the golden bags yelpers raved about. All ranged from ok to good. Nothing we had substantially stood out, and the taste easily dismissible."}
