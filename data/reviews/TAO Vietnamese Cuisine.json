{"text":"TAO serves up typical Vietnamese Ph & Bún fast! I ordered bún with satay beef  and spring rolls and went to the washroom to wash my hands and my food had arrived by the time I got back to the table. The spring rolls were freshly fried but the ratio to filling to wrapper could be improved as I tasted mostly wrapper. The satay beef didn't taste very much of satay flavour but lemon grass did come through and it wasn't at all spicy. The Nouc cham was good. Overall the food was okay. The bún had a good ratio of noodles to meat and vegetables. Tao is a safe bet for a quick and satisfying vietnamese lunch. There's street pay parking. One tip: Don't sit in the area to the right of the front door during the winter as there is a definite draft as people enter and exit the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great value, friendly staff and the food was delicious and they give you decently large portions.  The broth was probably one of the best I've had in the city.  The decor and overall atmosphere is very plain and the tables are quite close together so I'm sure it would get relatively noisy during peak hours but my experience was overall really good."}
{"text":"I had tried this when it was Dominion Diner and it was... not good. When I saw it had changed to a Vietnamese restaurant I mentally made a note to give it a shot 

Today was that day! I was surprised by the bright, well styled interior and the size of the menu. I was there specifically for a sub though, and I order a beef sate for me and a deep fried bananas with ice cream for the Mini.

The food arrived quickly and was hot. The sub had a soft, beautifully flaky baguette, spicy beef sate, peanuts and sauce, and the usual veggies. There was no cheese on my sub, which is what you see in a lot of the downtown Vietnamese sub joints. The deep fried bananas were tasty, crispy, and a well-sized portion. 

I look forward to going back to try everything else!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho! Nice big portions and the sate was delicious and spicy. Flavorful broth, lots of noodles and meat, good prices. I'll be back!"}
