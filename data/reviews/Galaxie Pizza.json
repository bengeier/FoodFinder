{"text":"Pizza was cold, flavours were meh... nothing special. Wouldn't order from them again. I'm sure there's better pizza in Laval."}
{"text":"One of the better pies we've had. It's hard to define why it is. I mean, it's your run of the mill dough, cheese, marinara sauce and toppings. We have ordered on more than 4 occasions and the impression is still more than favorable. The guy at the cash is polite and receptive. There are more than a dozen places like this one, possibly as good. But we found our go-to pizza parlor."}
{"text":"Pizza were spot on! Gives you your fix, crust was thin but still chewy, which i love with generous portions of toppings! Service was friendly and speedy. My pizza was hot and ready in 10 minutes! Definetly recommend!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza that you can either eat in, take-out or get delivered. Good prices and deals. Generous with the toppings. Pizza has never been disappointing. My only issue with the place is that they seem to have driver issues, hate having a craving and want a delivery only to be told they have no driver that day. Lame."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The pizzas taste great, are reasonably priced, and the delivery was super fast. I was blown away with the speed and pleasantly surprised at the service and flavours. Staying at the Hampton? Look no further for pizza. As a side note; they speak English as well!"}
{"text":"La meilleure pizza du coin. Je suis une grande fan de pizza et la livraison peut être souvent décevante mais pas avec cette pizzerie. La pizza est grande, frâiche et à  bon prix. 
Mes amis lavallois, je vous conseille fortement de passer une commande un jeudi soir à Galaxie Pizza."}
{"text":"Philly Steak and BBQ Chicken are my top choices! Friendly people and clean restaurant."}
