{"text":"I went there a couple week ago. The service was great small place. I had there osso buco meat it was good so much could only eat half. Wine was good by the glass a Malbec. I and my friend had there seafood soup was very good. I would recommend you try this place"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful little restaurant in Northwest Vegas! Great ambiance, great food, great service.  Although it's an Italian restaurant, have the empanadas appetizer...you won't regret!  For dinner we had the seafood ravioli and chicken/eggplant special, delicious.  To add to the experience it's a family owned place, owner is full of gracious personality."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible! Our first time here and we already feel like family, from the wait staff to the owner and even the guests! This is the type of place that will thrive off of repeat business! I just seriously wish I lived within 1600 miles! My girlfriend had the lobster ravioli; the sauce was to die for, I literally mopped it up with the fresh baked bread! I had the lobster tail and steak, everything was cooked to perfection! We stepped out to smoke, came back to homemade dessert on the house! I would have paid more money for less tasty food, the atmosphere and people were enough to make it my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Just can't say enough good things about this place. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming and sweet to our 3-year-old, that I probably would have come back just for the great atmosphere. But then we got our food.... OMG. The sauce was so good I practically wanted to lick my plate clean. And we finished off with the best creme brûlée I've ever had in my life. You should seriously eat here."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this gem of an Italian restaurant.  We love the ambiance, Silvia, the impeccable waitress, Ozzie, the affable owner and Johnny, the perfect bar host, and, of course the food.  The food is what people come here for and we have never had anything that we did not enjoy very much.  Their seafood dishes are wonderful; full of flavor, not over priced (very reasonable) and a good portion.  Their pasta dishes are great; Veal Parmesan?  Great!  Eggplant Parmesan?  Wonderful!  Appetizers?  Terrific!  Wine list?  Decent as well.  Desserts? MMMMMMMM!

The staff here is personable, attentive, and really care about your experience.  We love to come here and the only reason we don't frequent more often is so that we don't get nonchalant about it.  In fact, we are going to be there tonight and made reservations.  Hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a local restaurant close to my home and I found Bogey. The service was flawless and the food was exceptionally good! The owner visit my table to say hello and sent over desert on the house . Great atmosphere very friendly people and delicious food."}
{"text":"At 8pm, stopped into this place (I think it's actually called Bogey's) with two very tired and hungry small children. The proprietor was incredibly welcoming and got us quickly set up at a table with crayons for the kids. The food came out very quickly and was excellent. Chicken Piccata and Chicken Marsala both were terrific. Although no kids menu, they make small portions for the little ones. The service was also excellent ... The best I've had in awhile. As it was a weekday, the owner and staff sat down for a family meal together as we left. If you're in the neighborhood and looking for a good meal, great service and friendly atmosphere, this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good. I had the Fettuccine Carbonara.  Very creamy.  Crabcakes were delicious as well."}
{"text":"Food was really tastey. Atmosphere was cozy. Owner was the best as he greeted my table to make sure we were satisfied.  I ordered the lasagna, it was excellent. Will visit again when I'm in the mood for Italian food."}
{"text":"Place is delicious. Lucky to have found this restuarant. Wil be visiting again soon. Will also be our go to restaurant for visiting guest. 

Great atmosphere. Try the lasagna and save room for the Creme Bulle. 

Tell Johnny, the guy at the door, Keith said hello."}
{"text":"Once again this place made me and my family come back for the third time and just like the first time it didn't disappoint us at all it only gets better and better is been so good that me and my family are becoming regulars and how can you not..? Specially when Ozzy (owner)Silvia(server) Mike(bar tender) Leonardo(chef) and Maria(server's assistant) makes you feel welcome and the service plus the food and the ambiance is nothing less than exceptional.  I don't have enough words to say about this place but always always is been nothing but greatness!! Last but not least thank you so so much Elmer for assisting Silvia in giving us a great service every time we are there."}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in the door we were welcomed and served immediately. My husband had the chicken parmigiana and I had the chopped salad with a pasta dish.  Everything tasted delicious, fresh, and authentically Italian.  We finished with the tiramisu. The lady fingers tasted like they were baked here also."}
{"text":"First time. Very good food. Like to see that this type of restaurant in NW that is doing good food.."}
{"text":"Incredible!!!  This is what Italian food is SUPPOSED to taste like.  AND the service was perfect!  I can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"The best Italian in the northwest for sure! I'm in love with the lobster ravioli topped with mussels in pink sauce. We were there the other night and my fiancee ordered the veal special and was very happy. The owner Ozzie is a wonderful guy with a great sense of humor. We've been there 3 times in the last 2 weeks and are having a rehearsal dinner there next week."}
{"text":"I have lived all around the world and never eaten so good sea food. Simply heaven. Cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen. It's like stepping into a living room of a multimillionaire. Italian waitress who really is from Italy. Fantastic hidden gem. Typically I do not write reviews, but I had to after being there. Moved me. You want to impress your girl, take her there."}
{"text":"Wonderful food!  Saw this place had great reviews, decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed.  The sea bass was excellent, the Linguine with clams was fresh and the clams were huge, not like the little things that are in so many other resturants linguine dishes.  The meatballs were fresh and my daughter loved them.   Definately give this place a try, well worth it and reasonably price."}
{"text":"It's definitely a good idea to have a reservation . It's a very small quaint restaurant . We were there on a Friday evening and the service was excellent. Our server Oscar was very attentive ! The chicken parmigiana was bursting with flavor and the Italian sea bass was lighted sautéed in a lemon garlic butter sauce with asparagus and mashed potatoes . The prices and ambiance were excellent ! I highly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Can't see enough good things about this restaurant we found on Yelp.  We went there for a 17th bday party and the service and food could not have been better.  Several had Mediterranean Sea Bass and it was absolutely delicious.  One had chicken pam and it was wonderful and another had pasta - all very very good.  Syria and Oscar was wonderful waiters and Ozzie was such a friendly manager (maybe owner.)  We will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"North Beach Italian Bistro is the new restaurant in Northwest Las Vegas serving traditional Italian food at moderate prices with outstanding service.  Owned by Ozzie Montano, who formerly owned and operated the North Beach Café in Vegas many years ago, his new restaurant is a well addition to the dining scene in this area.  Have eaten there twice in past two weeks and have not been disappointed with the selection of dishes.   The walls are decorated with artwork by renowned artist Aldo Luongo is a similar fashion to his old restaurant.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"After cruising through Yelp for local Italian restaurant suggestions, we read the reviews for North Beach Italian Bistro and I decided to give it a go. So glad I did! We were an international group, ok, just one frenchman, and four Americans. The wonderful entrees were enhanced by the lovely service. In one visit this place is our favorite dining experience for Northwest Las Vegas. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Not too many great Italian restaurants in the Northwest but this is one of them! Don't let the bar side fool you.  Small staff but super friendly. Prices were reasonable, definitely coming back. Great place for a date Night or small family. Shrimp ravioli was amazing!"}
{"text":"North Beach reaches new heights each time we have dinner. Last night they featured a cream of broccoli soup that was superb. I love soup and this was as good as it gets. Tried a special linguine and seafood bouillabase LOADED  with seafood and pasta. Just outstanding with a wonderful tomato style broth. The portion was huge, so this will be my lunch, in a few hours.
No better Italian food in town. Service and ambience matches the food. MANGIA"}
{"text":"Good for dinner, bad for happy hour due to poor customer service.
We went for an anniversary dinner which was excellent! We saw they had an intimate bar inside the restaurant with a happy hour menu & drink specials. I thought we would try it next time. 
When we we returned, the hostess was practically guarding the door.  When we tried to go in she grilled us as to our purpose! We said we would like to enjoy the happy hour at the bar. She said it was reserved, probably for their cast of regulars. (There were only three people sitting there.) She offered us a dinner table instead. I asked if the happy our deals were extended to the tables and she said no.
Instead of turning away customers, they could've offered us at a side table and extended the  happy hour menu to us. Another gentleman was turned away for the same reason.

As I said, our previous dinner visit was delicious but we were not up for spending another $100.00 for dinner. We just were looking for a nice neighborhood happy hour place. We will not be back. It was embarrassing to be turned away!"}
{"text":"I am in town for work and wanted somewhere to eat some good Italian food.  Not only is the food wonderful, but it is a nice place to go to solo.   Had the fettuccine Alfredo (I am very picky about the Alfredo sauce) the sauce was light and creamy and the fettuccine was fresh and handmade.  Received a tiramisu on the house and ate every bit of it even though I was full from my meal.
I will be in town for quit sometime and will defiantly be back and make sure my local co-workers know about this little gem in the suburbs."}
{"text":"First time coming here date night with my girlfriend. Immediately we were greeted and seated. Oscar was our server,  he provided  excellent customer service, the staff was very  attentive The food was delicious best I've had. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. A hidden gem. Very nice intimate yet casual atmosphere. I avoided coming here several time fearful I was by dressed for the occasion.  You can come in jeans and a polo or a tux. 

The staff was fantastic. Everyone took great care of us, but not in an over whelming way. Great selection of entrees ranging from traditional classics to some unique to the restaurant.  I enjoyed the chicken parmagian. Breading was tasteful and it came with a side of pasta. Both entrees were great portions. But not crazy big. We finished with tiramisu. 

This restaurant did not disappoint. We will certainly be back. Thank you to the great team who took care of us."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour tonight with a friend after work, and was treated like family by the staff! Oscar the bartender was wonderful and makes you feel like you've been coming there forever! Found my new Happy Hour spot! The food was great too!"}
{"text":"Finally a great restaurant back in the neighborhood! We've been going to Bogey's for the past 14 years and have seen the restaurants come and go. North Beach Bistro is like a breath of fresh air, not to mention a reminder of what Vegas used to be! The food was excellent, and the service was excellent! If your in the neighborhood give it a try!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. Have been coming to Vegas for over a decade and have lived here for almost 2 years. Never ever have I found a place that not only has great food, but you're treated like family. I've never been one to frequent a place too often, especially in a city like Vegas because food options are so plentiful and dynamic, you shouldn't have to. But this spot is my one exception. I make a pout to come here at least once a week. It's really good Italian food and you cannot, will not beat the hospitality around here.  Much love to Oscar the bartender and Ozzie the owner.  They do an amazing job.  I'm not the only regular. There's a lot.  Check it out for yourself and you may become one too. A+"}
{"text":"I was just there and I am giving a one star review only due to the food. The staff was incredible and very friendly! The owner greets you in person which excels in customer service! They do everything with passion. However, the food is horrible:( the fish smelled and was old. The butternut squash ravioli was smothered in big tomato chunks and the sauce looked like someone vomited. I really wanted to like it and feel bad about the bad review solely on the fact That the staff was outstanding! But after all you go out to eat and customer service solely on its own cAnt cut it!"}
{"text":"First class Italian, locally owned, great service, great prices, where do I stop. You have to try best Italian food secret in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great service! Friendly staff! Awesome food! Cute, small , romantic atmosphere. With live music! I would come back!"}
{"text":"Went In today April 18th staff was nice enough. Good atmosphere other than that a little to pricey I though for what you get, food was all right portion where to small."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Bread comes out warm and pasta dishes are wonderful. Full of flavor and large portions.

Place might be a little hard to find, it is inside Bogey's and there is no light up sign, Just a banner on the side of Bogey's. At least gps will send you to the correct place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Have been here before and food was good.  Brought friends and the service was HORRIBLE.  the food was very dissapointing.  Sent my food back because the noodles were like mush.  Won't go back"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but it didn't happen. This is my first and only dining I will do here. 
Nice ambient place. Then the ordering. 
First the ice tea was horrible. Had to get soda which I don't like. 
Second ordered chicken empanadas. These had like pimento in them and that ruined it for me. 
Then I got the chicken parm. The chicken was fatty and tasted frozen. The sauce they serve I think is what I hate. I didn't eat any of the dish. My husband got lasagna and he hated it as well. Honestly , I hate Olive Garden but I will go to carabas when I need Italian. This was just not good. The 2 stars is for the really sweet doorman."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by to have dinner, first of all the restaurant is beautiful! After.  The server brought us are wine She Went over the specials for the evening. We ended up having the pollo parm and cioppino. Both were delicious. Service was outstanding also. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"It was a really great night with my girl and we had a romantical dinner. :-) we had chicken franchise and chicken marsala it was awesome the bread at the table was the bomb!  we'll be back here again!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Italian Resturant. The staff are fantastic. The owner has been in the area for a very long time and the food is spectacular. My wife and I live close by so it's perfect for us, and it saves us the trip to the strip for our favorite food. The wait staff are Italian (most of them) which adds to the experience. The specials vary, and are always excellent. The drinks are generous pours, excellent wine selection, and the bar staff are just great folks. We love it, and highly recommend it to all our friends."}
{"text":"Came back for our 3rd visit, I helped out the dishwasher by cleaning the plate, not much left for him to do, once again a great meal"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by doing a search on Yelp for a restaurant that served cioppino in the area I was in.  It had good ratings and I like to try new places.  I made a reservation through the Yelp site and made comments on some special needs for the table to be wheelchair accessible.  The restaurant was very accommodating and confirmed our reservation.  When we arrived, they were quick to get us seated and service from there on out was superb!  The food was delicious, especially the calamari and the cioppino.  Prices are very reasonable and they do not skimp on the amount of seafood in their dishes.  The atmosphere is clean and pleasant.  I will definitely be returning to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas and need to find new favorites. Service is beyond great!! The Saltimbocca was delicious. Definitely our go to for Italian."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most delicious authentic Italian restaurants in Las Vegas. The customer service and decor were awesome and the hostess was very friendly. Now, on to more important matters...the FOOD. We ordered the crab cakes, chicken parm and the shrimp with mushroom pasta. The crab cakes were a nice, light, fluffy starter. The sauce on top was a great addition. The chicken parm was also a fantastic option. The parm is so tender that you can slice it with a fork. Lastly, the shrimp and mushroom pasta was rustic and earthy--loved it. I had such a great experience here and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Impeccable service! This was my first time at this restaurant and I will DEFINITELY be going back several more times! From the moment I walked into the door everyone was extremely attentive and accommodating! I went during happy hour and the specials were delicious! When my entree came I was stuffed but still went for it and it was delicious!! At the end of the evening the owner even paid for my desert; which also tasted amazing! 

I had: Calamari, Crab cakes, crab&shrimp ravioli and ended with the cannoli!!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for years and always thought it was just a bar.  I had company in town a couple of weeks ago and we were looking for a new Italian place to try. It's a small place and it is only open for dinner 5 nights a week, but I am so glad I found it.  Comfortable atmosphere.  Great service.  Reasonable prices.  And really great food with portion sizes that sent us all home with leftovers.  I will most certainly be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe!  Sinatra would of dined here and would of  made it his hangout.  Low key music playing in the back ground.  Bread and butter are served right away.  Our waitress,  Sylvia really describes the specials down to the smallest detail.  She was awesome. 

I ordered the sea bass,  mashed Potatoes and Asparagus.  Cooked to flaky tender sea bass perfection. 

Hubby had the lobster ravioli in vodka sauce. He loved it and said he needed a second plate.

Ozzie came out and talked to his guests Luke a true owner! 
 
Will be coming back super soon."}
{"text":"What a great place!   Lived in Vegas close to 15 years.  Drove past this restaurant many times and just never considered it before.  After reading a few reviews here on Yelp, my wife and I decided to visit this restaurant for the first time to celebrate our anniversary.  

What a gem this restaurant is.  We sincerely loved our experience and we will be back for sure.  The food was excellent, the service was superb.  

You will not be disappointed!   To the owners, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!! Bad location for an amazing eatery. Been here a handful of times now and every time has been exceptional food and service. I would recommend Choppino,Fettuccini Alfredo,Linguine and clams thus far ALL appetizers are tasty! Good selection of wines and full bar too. Great atmosphere for grabbing a bite to eat and cocktail at bar. Check hours,closed beginning of week. Open only for dinner service. Support this local biz it's worth it;))"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time for a late dinner. I have always lived a block away from here my whole life, and have never been in. We saw the great reviews and decided to give it a try. Man, am I happy we did. This place is so nice and quaint, I love the gorgeous fish tank behind the bar. The people here are so nice. We talked to the owner/ manager of food service and he was so very nice. Our waitress was so sweet and attentive. Both of us had the cheese tortellini and they were to die for. But then I had the creme brûlée and oh my goodness, it was fantastic!! And the prices were more than reasonable, I couldn't be more pleased with this place!! We will be coming back here time and time again to enjoy the fantastic service and phenomenal food. I am so happy we finally tried this place, I can't wait to come back very, very soon!! If you are considering coming here for a wonderful meal, I highly suggest you do. You definitely won't be sorry."}
{"text":"My wife  and I live in Painted Desert and stumbled in one night. Great food and value...Bartender John is great and had great conversation. We need more places like this in NW Vegas! Unique and not cookie cutter."}
{"text":"Have tried all the veal dishes, all wonderful.  If you want a relaxing dinner this is the place. Make sure the ladies have a shawl being Vegas and AC.  Everything on the menu is wonderful but the veal is marvelous.
Since the owner is from Argentina don't miss his selection of Malbec or his other great wines.
Definetly a place to go especially if you want to avoid The Strip."}
{"text":"Been here twice and had a pretty good experience both times. Last time I got chicken marsala: sauce was flavorful but chicken was a little bit dry. This time I got the linguini with shrimp and mushroom in a creamy tomato sauce and it was delicious. The service was also pretty good. They were a little busier than usual tonight so the waitress took a little while to check on us but she was nice and friendly. The restaurant has a cozy and calm vibe. It's a great place for romantic date or family dinner. The place is split into 2 areas, one side is the restaurant with a small bar in it and the other side is a full bar/lounge. Overall, I enjoy coming here and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"A twenty five year quest finally ended when I found this restaurant.  I never thought that I would find eggplant parmesan as good as my grandmother's.  This place final meth the mark.  This is the best Italian restaurant in Vegas.  I try to eat there at least a few times a month."}
{"text":"I grew up having some amazing Italian food. My extended family lived in Milwaukee, and when we would visit, we would always go to an Italian restaurant. Well, I've finally found a great Italian place called North Beach Italian Bistro. The outside of the restaurant is deceiving...but don't judge a book by its cover. Inside, it had a very relaxing and pretty atmosphere. I loved the large fish tank behind the bar!

The food was amazing. I ordered spaghetti--probably some of the best meat sauce I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parmigiana, and that was really good too! Everything on the menu was reasonably priced, and they give you a lot of food. I made two meals from my plate.  Unfortunately, I was too full to try any desserts. I really wanted to try a cannoli! So, I'll be headed back there soon!"}
{"text":"The GF and I were looking for a nice, romantic place to enjoy dinner in the Centennial area.  Not wanting to go anywhere near the strip on Saturday night, I pulled out the yelp stone and gazed heavily upon it.  After refining my search and reading the NBIB reviews, I used the yelp function to make a reservation.

NBIB is located inside Bogies.  This may or may not have changes names many times since I have been here in Vegas.  I have not so many fond memories of slinging concrete back in 96' west of this location.  I was very excited to give this a shot.

Again, I waved my hands over the oracle that is yelp, and used a not so often used (in my world) reservation function. 8:00 PM, was the time.

Upon our arrival, we were greeted in the space between Bogies and NBIB by our host.  We told him we had a reservation and he seemed confused, and this made me confused.  He told us he would talk to management and quickly returned to show us to our booth.  You can definitely smell the age of Bogies on the other side, there shorter time you spend in this area...the better.

We sort of dressed up for the occasion, business casual.  We found the restaurant to contain others that dressed up and a few who were dressed pretty casual.

Our waitress was prompt and super friendly.  We ordered a bottle of wine, which the bartender quickly brought to the table and put on ice.  Bread would eventually follow, and was fresh and tasty.  We ordered up some garlic bread and the first batch was awesome.  A second batch, not so much as every piece was marred by char.  This was quickly rectified and did not reflect on the bill.

The waitress returned and we were ready to order.  We ordered up a Caprese Salad.  The tomatoes were fresh and delicious as was the Mozzarella.

I ordered up the Chicken Marsala.  It was wonderful!  The combination of bountiful mushrooms and tasty garlic was amazing!

The GF ordered the Linguine con Gamberi e Funghi. The linguine was cooked to perfection. The shrimp and mushrooms were righteous.  The creamy tomato sauce was smooth as silk.

While dinning a very nice gentleman, sadly I do not know his name, sat down and explained NBIB's error on the reservation.  I appreciated his time and sitting down is always a nice touch.

For dessert, we went with a slice of Spumoni pie.  It was an excellent way to finish off the meal.

If your up in the area and looking to not travel down into the bowels of the valley for a nice Italian dinner for two (or more), give North Beach Italian Bistro a shot!"}
{"text":"Love! A hidden gem. Food is great, service is great, and the place is small and comfortable! Wish I had tried it sooner,  will never go back to olive garden."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this establishment by accident nestled in Suburbia and each time we have been the more and more impressed we become perfect hole in the wall for a intimate date night or to enjoy authentic Italian cuisine with family and friends"}
{"text":"Worst Italian food I've ever had. Everything was bland and tasteless. When we drove up on a Saturday night, the empty parking lot should've been our first clue. I really think friends of the owner must be writing the reviews because there is no way almost 5 stars is accurate. This restaurant has a very expired feel to it and the food is not good at all. Take your money elsewhere. Just wanted to give an honest opinion because I feel like the rest of the reviews are fake."}
{"text":"A great little gem in the Northwest. Simple, honest and delicious food. The service was attentive and friendly and made us feel appreciated. It is also a genuine value, not only for the well priced menu items, but for the well chosen and fairly priced wine selections. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Very authentic Italian food blew us away. Prices are really fair, and staff is quick, responsive, and very professional.  We will definitely be back. Chicken Parm was phenomenal, and tiramisu was best we've had in years."}
{"text":"We happened on this restaurant because we were in the area and saw the Yelp recommendation.  We were a little early for dinner so stopped first in the bar, which turned out to be a gem. The bartender was friendly.  We were able to play the usual bar games for free drinks and the payout seemed generous - we both won.  They have a small selection of bar food - the onion rings and wings were very good.  We proceeded to the restaurant when it opened and enjoyed our meals.  The pasta was prepared well and the sauce delicious. The special seafood dish was beautifully presented if not perfectly prepared - some of the seafood was a little overdone.  Our service was extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Old School Vegas Service. This is my go to restaurant for all occasions. Friendly caring ownership, attentive staff and traditional Italian food. This is truly a hidden gem in the North West."}
{"text":"SO MUCH YES!! Please let me start by saying that Italian food is one of my least favorites to eat, but North Beach Italian Bistro has changed that. 

My husband and I called in on a Friday night around 7:30 to check their wait time and whoever took the phone call stuck a reserved sign on a table for us right then and there. We did let him know we were just about a mile away. 

The service was perfect, as our waitress was courteous and prompts. We had ordered the eggplant Parmesan and chicken Parmesan. Both were delicious and loaded with cheese (too much for my liking but at least you know they're not holding back). Complimentary bread was also nice and warm. 

The only negative I can think of is the cannoli filling  was mediocre. The shell was perfect and the tiramisu was fantastic. 


Overall vibes in this place are great. Seems like everyone know everyone. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is an old school type eatery. Their foods and service are outstanding. This is a small restaurant but big in hospitality and very inviting to kick back and relax while enjoying a very special meal. There clam bake and garlic bread are a nice appetizer. Their fish is yummy.  The chicken franchese with veggies is yummy."}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars...  GREAT food and great service.  Oscar the bartender is consistently friendly and attentive and  Ozzie the owner is there to open the door,  shake your hand and great you EVERYTIME!!  There are other great Italian restaurants in Vegas but for the locals this is a hell of a Gem!!!  Side note..  Mike at Bogeys the bar next door is also the best!!!"}
{"text":"We went there on St. Patrick's day. 

I ordered pizza. They came back and said the ovens were not working I would have to pick something else. 

While I was looking through the menu, they came out with rolls, fresh from the oven????

I settled on spaghetti. It came out with sauce that was the consistency of thin soup. Along with no taste."}
{"text":"Traveling for work and wanted a nice dinner. This was by far the best food of the trip. The chicken masala was so yummy. Will recommend to other coworkers who come to the area."}
{"text":"Wow!  Just when you begin to think that Las Vegas lacks quality and class NBIB changed our minds real fast-we were blown away..  The food and service was exceptional. Olive Garden is no where near comparison but I can assure you that all that we got--1 salad, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 domestic beer and 1 wine would have cost us a higher tab at OG....  I know the food is 10 times better here...  We were curious how our experience would be by just trusting yelp and not having a friend's referral....  I told the girlfriend as we sat for a beverage at the Bogey's Pub next door(a greeting station area divides them) that any restaurant that only opens for dinner/supper probably focuses on detail.  The other 2 things I loved was of course Bogey's to wet our whistle before dinner(we got there well prior to our 5pm reservation) and being just a little bit away from most all other businesses was neat--an exclusive location a few long blocks from Ann Rd. & Centennial Center...

Oh, it is okay here to be really casual.... I wore cargo shorts, a nice shirt, and flip flops....  The girlfriend out dressed me as always....  In a weird way I did feel like we were on vacation perhaps near a beach and stumbled on a great place to eat...  Go there you will not be disappointed!!!   Rick"}
{"text":"First the venue and the ambiance, I have to admit it is nice. Spacious dining room, comfortable booths and tables, simple and elegant decoration, and ample parking spots. This place has all the basic ingredients to become a 4.5 star restaurant. 

However, when we first walked in, the host, which I assume to be the owner, addressed my party with Arrigato -- since we are Asian and thus he presumes that either we are Japanese or all Asians speak Japanese - a presumption that irritates me tremendously. I have to bite my tongue not to respond in German, in order to correct his presumption. 

We were seated and now the food:  

1. We ordered the crab cake, special of the day,  for appetizer. The crab cake is OK taste wise, but it is full of fillers. Actual amount of crab meat is very minimal. Also included in the crab cake are many vegetable ingredients. The plating is attractive but still not my type of crab cake due to the amount of fillers.  Grade: C-.

2. We ordered a Caesar Salad - it is quite sandy. It is  unthinkable that the lettuces they use are not well cleaned. Portion is good but plating needs improvement.   Grade: C-.

3. Veal Chop - special of the day. A large bone in veal chop with a lot of tasty spinach and mushroom. This should be an A dish -- unfortunately the dish has to be re-heated as the chop is still rare. The mash potato is probably from a box. A 4.5 star restaurant should offer home-made mash potato. Aside from the deficiencies, I will still rate this dish a B+.

4. Shrimp Scampi with Papadelle pasta. The portion is good and there are 8 or 9 decent size shrimps in this dish. This is in a lemony cream sauce and it is quite tasty.  May be it is just a personal preference, but the sauce is just too tart. I can only rate it as a B-.

This is not a 4.5 star restaurant as other yelpers have indicated so. Food really has to improve. It does have all the basic requirements but improvements needed. A 3 star restaurant is about it."}
{"text":"Great food. Wonderful seafood!! The most friendly service from all of the staff. Live music. Great atmosphere! Loved it!"}
{"text":"I had delicious angel hair seafood pasta (fruti di Mare.)  Great homemade light maranera sauce.  DELICIOUS!  Bread was good.  I wish this was a local place in Los Angeles.  It is a hidden gem.  The staff is all Italian and have been in the food business for a long time.  The appreciate what good service is.  I strongly recommend trying this place out.  Next time i am in Vegas, i will try to visit again."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I've lived down the street for about 5 years now and never knew it was there. 
When we decided to go I was skeptical because the out side doesn't look all that. But when we went in we were greeted right away and show our seats. The owner Ozzie is the one that seated us and spoke kindly to my 4 year old. 
When we sat our drink orders where taken and brought timely, and the bread ...... Was deliciousness!!!! It took a minute for our food to come but when it did, it was well worth the wait! The inside was gorgeous, the setting and ambience was spectacular. The wait staff was the friendliest I've seen in a while, and the service was impeccable .
I will defiantly be going back from now on! Well done Ozzie!"}
{"text":"this was the best food and service we've ever had. shout out to my boy johnny basil, chef leonardo, and my girl sylvia"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Great service and chicken parm is fantastic!  Oscar at the bar gives excellent service."}
{"text":"The server was manipulating! We were charged for salads when we were asked what kind of salad would you like? ...The food had absolutely no flavor. The Marsala was decent. The clams were ok everything else for a family of 5 was absolutely nasty. The one star is for the 10% military discount it should have been 50 percent for the no flavor having insulting the Italian tittle restaurant. Very disappointed will not return! Oh and the wine was cheapo cheapo cheapo not what was on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food was very flavorful but I thought it was pricey for the proportion sizes. Plus the dinner price does not include salad. Service was friendly and attentive and the environment is beautiful but too pricey for what you get. Fish tank is beautiful."}
{"text":"Las Vegas has a lot of great restaurants for any budget, that's a fact. What's generally lacking is the service, and an atmosphere that's friendly, but not forced. Not at North Beach. My husband and I came here on a whim about 6 months ago in an attempt to find an Italian joint close to our house that wasn't a cookie cutter chain restaurant, and have come back every week since. The food is superb Italian - all of your favorite classic dishes and then some. They have great happy hour specials too. The staff is what sets this place apart, and a huge reason why this place has quickly become our weekly spot. They make you feel like family, and not just a customer coming in to their establishment. And to that point, so do the regulars. If you're looking for a great local spot, then look no further than North Beach. Come in and you'll see for yourself."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Italian I've had. Tried 2 dishes plus the meatballs.  All was either flavorless or just tasted bad.  My pasta felt like it was reheated in the microwave."}
{"text":"North Beach is our favorite neighborhood spot for a nice Italian dinner. I'm almost always working when the restaurant is open, so I try to come here when I have an extra night off. The food is great, and so are the people that work here. 

The owner, Ozzie, is a long time Vegas resident originally from Argentina. You'll find empanadas on the menu and I always ask for a side of chimichurri. The fish tank behind the bar is visually appealing. Be sure to look for the original photo of the owner with Elvis Presley in Vegas on a wall at the end of the bar.

I've enjoyed every pasta dish that I've tried and prices are very reasonable. Chef prepares a menu of nightly specials that look delicious. The dark ambiance makes for a nice candlelit dinner but the crayons and paper table covers remind you that North Beach is very family friendly. They've recently introduced a nightly happy hour on drinks and appetizers from 5-7pm so it's the perfect time to dine at this neighborhood gem sharing a building with Bogey's Bar and Sweet Spot Event Center."}
{"text":"Just go!  It is so so good. Service amazing. Food is just great.  Best chicken parm I ever had ... Even compared to my mother who is italian.  I can't put in words how great this place is to dine at...please just go!  We love it."}
{"text":"I would definitely do this again. Linguini and clams could have used a touch more spice. The fried calamari was spot on!"}
{"text":"Let me just say OMG! This place is delicious! Not only the food was great but the people were amazing! Everyone is friendly, the service was great and the dinner was to die for! My husband and I will return for sure. So will my friends. I would've never knew about this place if it wasn't for yelp. they also do parties and weddings."}
{"text":"This place is some of the best Italian in Vegas. A little ways out of the way from them heavily populated areas this is definitely a gem. 
Service here is top-notch, the employees know their menu, and the atmosphere is fantastic.
Tried their 16-ounce veal chop special last night and I couldn't be more pleased. I asked for a medium body piano wire with my meal and the wine that was brought to me was just perfect for it.
Me and my boyfriend will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the drive. Chicken Franches, why yes please! Hard to find! Homemade meatballs! And a free desert! All this and a warm welcome and good service-we will be back even if it's 20 minutes away"}
{"text":"Phenomenal.
Everything is astounding here at NBIB. 
From the owner, Ozzie - to the wait staff, Sylvia and Lucio - to the bartender, Johnny. Everyone is gracious and inviting.
AND THE FOOD!!
Delicious. We and our friends and family have succeeded, in the many times we have visited, to try every dish on the menu and no one, not one single person has been disappointed. THAT says scads about North Beach Italian Bistro.

The prices are perfect for a neighborhood restaurant, both for the food and for the cocktails. The ambiance is happy, the mood is upbeat. You come, you're happy. You enjoy the whole time you are here. You leave, you start planning when you are coming back. This to me is the penultimate restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour ! Johnny Basil great bar tender and Ozzie is the best best host and owner!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service with awesome tasting food - highly recommend coming to eat here. The team make you feel at home and never rushed to leave!"}
{"text":"So we are long time Las Vegans also, but haven't been to this restaurant in a long time.  Since the reviews were so good, decided to try it.  We were disappointed!  The calamari was barely edible, way too chewy.  The entrees were ok, not hot enough and the portions marginally small.  The service was very good however and I saw the owner several times and thought it odd that he never came over to the tables to see how things were.  Won't return, sorry!"}
{"text":"Had high hope considering the reviews. The piccata was bland with very few capers. Meatballs were ok but the sauce was horrible. Our dogs liked it though. The seafood special was ok with the asparagus and brocollini tasting too acidic that we could not eat it. The caprese and crabcake was just ok. If you have to put your own balsamic and oil on your caprese salad at least put a good quality on the table.  The only thing we enjoyed was the bread but for $80 for tap water and no dessert it was way too expensive.  We won't be going back. It wasn't even worth $30. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We went to North Beach Italian Bistro for our anniversary. While it is not super fancy or pretentious, it was very comfortable and friendly. Everyone we came in contact with was so nice and so friendly. From the Hostess, to the bartender to the server and the food runner. Everyone was great and gave us great service. The owner and the bartender both stopped by to see how our meal was. 

We ordered the calamari appetizer which was HUGH!  The calamari was perfectly done and not greasy at all. Then we each had a salad. My husband had the Caesar and I had the Italian Mista. Both were excellent. For our entrees, I had the Cioppino and my husband had the Cappelini Frutti di Mare. The Cioppino was different than any nice had before. Instead of a thick tomato stew base, it was a lighter broth, but was so flavorful and full of seafood. The Fruitti diMari was also different, as it was served in a creamy white sauce, but again, it was delightful. 

This is a great neighborhood Italian restaurant. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a diamond in the rough. In a neighborhood filled with franchise cookie cutter restaurants this place fills a void and is a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"North Beach is a hidden gem! Excellent Italian food, the staff is very friendly, and the food is superb! All dishes are reasonably priced. I've eaten here 3 times and have never been disappointed. I love the  prosciutto mozzarella, lasagna, and the spumoni ice cream cake-all are delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a real hidden gem out in suburban Las Vegas, nestled randomly between residential neighborhoods. When you drive in to the lot - it feels like you're about to head in to a small church or some type of other venue. But once you walk in (and go left - there is a bar to the right), you are warmly greeted by the staff.

My family and I had reservations, and when we walked in, the staff seemed to know that it was us - they had a \"oh yes, they are here!\" type of positive energy - basically we felt very special. Props to the staff. We had several servers throughout the night, different members of the restaurant staff checking in on us. Each time felt genuine and never overwhelming or annoying, however. Truly top notch service!

The food is also good. We started off with Calamari Fritti as an appetizer, delicious calamari fried to a perfect gold. I had the Pollo Parmigiana (chicken parmesan) which was great and also comes with a small side of marinara pasta. The dishes my parents got were even better. My mother had the Lenguine con Gamberi e Funghi (lenguine with shrimp) which was tasty, and my dad had the Capelleni ai Frutti Di Mare, which was essentially a seafood-lovers pasta. It is angel hair pasta mixed with this delicious creamy sauce, topped with shrimp, lobster meat, scallions, and scallops. Next time I come back here, I'm definitely getting that dish!

I have GOT to mention the restrooms at this place. The men's restroom was probably one of the nicest restaurant restrooms I have used. It was a large room with part of the floor tiled, and others with a nice carpet. It was well-ventilated, well-decorated - and extremely clean. I feel restrooms seldom get mentioned, but North Beach's restaurants are five stars itself.

If you're ever out in this part of Vegas - this is definitely worth it. And it's very inexpensive. Have yourself a glass of wine and enjoy from their great selection of Italian dishes. When in doubt, go for the Capelleni ai Frutti Di Mare!"}
{"text":"Super authenic italian food, great waiters, and reasonable prices. I have fallen in love with their shrimp ravioli, frequently available on special."}
{"text":"By far the best non-gaming restaurant and lounge in Centenial Hills.  The food is amazing!!!!  Ozzie, the owner is always there and makes you feel welcome. Great place!!"}
{"text":"1st time here.  The wait staff was very friendly.  The Cheese Raviolis were very good.  The Linguine  anchor clams were ok. Probably would order something different next time.  The Matinis were large and delicious.  The server was very nice, the bartender was fantastic.  We will be back."}
{"text":"What a find! Delcious food with creative flavors, wonderful staff, friendly atmosphere, and reasonable prices. Will definitely return and recoomend it to others!"}
{"text":"Last night, Oct. 5, my hubby and I took our neighbor out to dinner and decided to try North Beach Italian Bistro.  Cannot give it enough stars.  Food was excellent, drinks were excellent, service was superb by a lovely young lady.  Loved the decor and a
mbience.  Everything was more than we had expected.  It will now be a regular for us."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Food and service is excellent. I had sea bass special and it was prepared perfectly, flaky and moist. Bf had lobster ravioli which was equally delicious. They have a good happy hour as well. Will be back."}
{"text":"This has to be the best service and best food ever!  We had the Crab Cakes, Lobster Ravioli and of course a cannoli... The food was amazing and the owner and his wife are very pleasant.  You can tell that all the food is hand made... No jarred food in this place."}
{"text":"Tick tock north beach bistro your reviews on the clock ....any longer waiting for the food I might turn 80"}
{"text":"Ordered take out 3 days ago. The sauce tasted like raw tomatoes from a can; and I swear I could taste the aluminum, the cheese ravioli were cold inside and undercooked, their \"Italian\" bread is more French bread than anything and it was also stale and hard. I feel beyond ripped off and disappointed and most of all, betrayed by every yelper who pushed this place to it's high star rating."}
{"text":"After walking into the dining area I knew why it was so important to have a reservation, it is sort of limited booths and tables - smaller than what I was expecting. But, it is a great place for date night. Very cozy. The atmosphere was great, I am originally from New York state and this place reminded me of everything Northeast. The food was nicely prepared but the bread came without butter. I am not sure if it was just our table or if none of the bread comes with butter, but I didn't ask either. I still give it five stars despite the butter and our server, she was all over the place and did not refresh our drinks however, the bartender (owner maybe) did, which I appreciated. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Best customer service I've ever had! Silvia was so sweet, and made it such a great first experience! There's no doubt that I'll be back! Not to mention, the food was really good and the prices were great considering I'm a college student and on a fixed budget!"}
{"text":"Great food and great price. If you look close you may even see a real mobster at the bar. Lol. Just kidding"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.   Crab cakes average at best. The sauce over it was like 1000 island dressing. Calamari was undercooked. I would havec enjoyed Ragu at home more than Putanesca.  My son had Bolognese about the same as Putsnesca.   Only one person on the table at more than half."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best places to eat authentic Italian dishes in the entire city. The food and service were both amazing."}
{"text":"North Beach Italian Bistro has become my favorite neighborhood restaurant. From the moment I walk in the door, I get a warm greeting from the owner and the bartender both of whom recognize me from previous visits. The food is reasonably price and wonderfully delicious.  The portions are large.....some times I go home with leftovers and other times I share a plate with a friend.  Gluten free pasta is available for those on special diets.  The north-west valley has very few outstanding restaurants.  North Beach Italian Bistro is a gem at the top of a short list.  I would recommend reservations as the dining area is not large and I know as it's reputation increases, this place will be swamped."}
{"text":"So I randomly found this place while scrolling through on Apple's Map App. I decided to look into because I wanted something I hadn't had before and I felt like some Italian food was gonna be the right choice.The place is basically a hidden gem. It's by itself as far as other restaurants that are near by.

The place looks like your gonna drop a pretty penny. The out side looks fancy and the inside is a beautiful set up for a date. The atmosphere is a moderate lighting with some soft music that you can relax to. The music is low almost to the point where if you are having conversation with the person or people you are with you cannot hear the music. 

It's good for kids from what I gather, I didn't have any there with me but the put some white paper on the table that is good for drawing and there is some crayons at the table for them to use. 

The staff is super friendly and checks on you at every step to ensure there is nothing else you need. The owner showed us to our seat when we arrived and check on as well about 2 times to ensure his staff was meeting our needs. 

The price wasn't to bad if you ask me. It's about $20 a person plus drinks, appetizers and desert. There is a full bar as well.

The food was great, it was hot when it came to the table. The food was fresh had an authentic Italian taste to it. had no complaints there. 

I definitely will be recommending this place to people. They also do big parties, they do weddings out back and they have a bar that is separate from the restaurant but you can still get the same great food n more."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food I crave again almost as soon as I leave, it's so good. Capellini ai Fruti di Mare is my favorite. The sauce!!!!! However, I've loved everything I've ordered every time I come. Once I picked up after a long 12-hour day at work and Osvaldo took my order even though they were closing and stayed open until I got there. Tonight, I enjoyed a lovely dinner with my best friend and godson. We enjoyed the drinks, the salad, pastas, and especially the warm conversation with the staff and Osvaldo. Our waitress was lovely and attentive. As if that wasn't enough, they sent over complimentary desserts. Love the Spumoni cake. Will keep coming back and telling others about this gem. Thank you, guys!"}
{"text":"Sooooo how do I describe this gem, well first of all I am going to say gem bc it is indeed a rare find. From the second I walked in the establishment I have been greeted and was welcomed and felt right at home like I had been coming here for years.. I started out first with the caprese that happened to be fresh to order with red and yellow  tomatoes it was very well put together and taste was even better... For my entree I ordered the chicken piccata sauce which was phenomenal and the veggies topped it off, to say i loved the sauce would do it an injustice, we will be definitely coming back for more and thank u once again for the wonderful service not to mention the tarimisu they included,  it just didn't stop see you soon!!!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for something new.  Where do I start?  Yelp of course!  

So I saw this place on here.  Decent reviews, convenient, inexpensive... sold.  When we pulled up though I was having second thoughts.  Honestly, it looks like a strip club walking up to the entrance.  Head right in the door, a typical bar.  Head left though?  A small Italian restaurant. 

It was a little brighter than I like but the staff greeted us immediately and was very friendly.  Service was good and so was the food.  I had the stuffed pork chop.  Expected chops, plural.  Still, tasty and we'll prepared.  We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"The staff is so polite and all attractively dressed. Truly a 5 star experience with level of service and attention to detail. The quiet little restaurant looks deceiving from the outside, don't judge a book by its cover - this is no \"Neighborhood bar\", it's very classy and perfect! Today's Mother's Day and our 1st trip here, I will definitely return for a DATE NIGHT! Special thanks to the bus boy, Landon, he made sure our napkins were fresh, waters were full, and bread baskets never emptied!"}
{"text":"So the only odd/off thing about this place is the location, though that might actually be a plus since it may keep the hordes away; this is important because the venue isn't large and probably cannot support the much larger following it deserves.

The service is excellent, everyone is attentive and friendly and knows their job thoroughly.  The owner makes it a point to engage with everyone, and I saw more than one back-slapping hug for regular patrons.  Like most places in Vegas, you can dress up or down and fit right in.  The atmosphere is casual.

The only disappointing thing was the caprese salad; it was beautiful but the mozzarella was bland and the tomatoes had no flavor.  Tomatoes with flavor are hard to find but I had hopes the chef possessed a good source.  Sadly, he seems to be stuck with the same beautiful, tasteless items as the rest of us that do not grow our own.

The wife had the chicken Marsala and it was excellent; I will likely order it the next time we visit.  I had the veal special, which this night was veal osso bucco.  It was fork-tender, oversize and thoughtfully served with a little shrimp-fork stuck in the bone for getting to the marrow, which was incredibly rich and savory.  I barely  touched the linguini served alongside and still failed to finish the veal.  The saucier is highly skilled, as both dishes were made complete by excellent sauces.

We finished with a cannoli, which was large enough for us both and as good as I've ever had.

We will certainly return, and I recommend this place without hesitation.  Try the veal osso buco if you are really hungry, or just want a lot of something delicious and well-crafted."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some amazing food. My chicken Parmesan was delicious. Great atmosphere for a date or a professional setting. Fantastic service but watch out for The owner he's a charmer. This place for sure needs to be put on The Food Network. Definitely coming back every time I come back to Vegas. If not for the food then for the Friendly people."}
{"text":"Yum! What a hidden gem in the northwest! We came here for our anniversary and it was great. We had a nice booth which was private and comfortable. Both our entrees were fantastic and good portions. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Surprising neighborhood restaurant in an unexpected location. We enjoyed everything, well priced tasty food and comfortable surroundings. There was a harp player who entertained us with familiar Italian songs, it added to our enjoyment of the evening."}
{"text":"This review is late..sorry.  Went here for a birthday dinner for our daughter.  It's got that old Vegas mobster feel, and it's really fun.  The service was amazing! They check on you and make suggestions on dishes.  Very knowledgeable of the type of food and very descriptive of the flavors. Everything was fresh..and you can tell the chef really takes pride in the dishes.  The gnocchi pesto pasta was so good,  and the portion was huge.  I actually had to bring the rest home.  Calamari was just the right texture, not overly chewy. Lasagna is whoa...get it.  Even the bread is good.  Some places are only concerned about your main dishes,  but the owners here know people enjoy the overall experience. Quality...is the key word, and they deliver."}
{"text":"Started with an appetite for Italian, living in the north west options are limited if you're not willing to go for a drive. So I found this place, via yelp no less based on its high reviews. First the bread isn't made fresh, if I'm wrong it's old at best. Second the meatballs are mediocre (italian places should have a great meatball), and with the meatball less egg she'll would be a welcomed change. The one dish out of the four that was even palatable was the penne alla vodka I'd give it a 6/10, but not worth the price paid."}
{"text":"Great place, really delicious food and a lovely staff. They fit my family and I in on Christmas Eve for which we were grateful. Solid pasta dishes and even good pizza! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This has been amazing!  The food the drinks and the owner made his way over to our table to check on us and wish our friend a happy birthday!!! The service was fantastic and we highly recommend this place!! We will be here again!!!"}
{"text":"Great chicken marsala lot of fun you have Bogies next door.  This is a good families place. I take my wife there. The bartender Oscar is the best in town!"}
{"text":"This is how a restaurant earns 5 stars!

First Star  The owner Ozzie greets everyone that walks through the door, and the second time I returned he remembered me and I felt like I was one of his regulars. Trust me, he has had regulars since the Rat Pack times when he had his first restaurant.

Second Star  Oscar the bartender has worked with Ozzie forever and does the same thing at the bar! He now knows my Mom, my friends and makes everyone feel welcome.  All of the staff is makes one feel they are at home and it works. I am not talking about the corporate chain way, everyone knows their repeat customers and they get to know new ones!

Third Star  The food is great. This is old school Italian done well! Sometimes we order off the Happy Hour menu, sometimes it is pasta, and the Osso Bucco was outstanding. The Chimichurri sauce is the Argentine twist to dip your bread. That is where Ozzie and Oscar are from! Desserts are to die for and I wish I could eat more of them but I can't eat gluten but I watch my friends and I am jealous!

Fourth Star  This will make you laugh, they have the most beautiful bathroom. What?!  What I do know about bathrooms, if they are clean and pristine like this one, it reflects a clean kitchen!

Fifth Star  When you combine all of the above, this is a dream come true, especially when it is located in the North!

I love this restaurant, and we ALL keep coming back!

Mille Grazie Ozzie and Oscar for all that you do and have created!


It always gets better!"}
{"text":"Decent, had sea bass piccata style was good a bit salty, tiramisu was outstanding, service good. Wine list could be better need some moderate priced Italian Chianti & Tuscan. All pretty low end wines on list. Will come back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Should have taken a picture of the food but it was to good! Only negative was the carpaccio was a little to thick for my taste. Service was 5 star!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Friday, 9/8/17.
Good service and good food.
Special seafood linguine was really good, packed with sea scallops, shrimp, squid, clams and mussels. Broth was perfect with the bread. Wife had penne with spinach and broccoli and she enjoyed it. Both had a fair amount of roasted garlic which really added a lot of flavor. 
Basically an older, local crowd but never felt unwelcome, in fact server and owner went out of their way to make sure everything was good. 
Inside of Bogey's, which is small casino and bar which is a little confusing at first but not difficult to figure out. 
We'll definitely be back when we're in town and in the area."}
{"text":"I had never been here before and brought out of town family here. We got Chicken Parm, shrimp/mushroom linguine, Frutti di Mare, Clam linguine, antipasto and drinks. Extremely reasonably priced! Dishes were $14-$20. We also got a few of the desserts- they were all delicious! Tiramisu was the best I had ever had. Customer service was fantastic and our waiter was attentive and incredibly friendly! Everyone had a great time and my family can't stop raving about it."}
{"text":"Oscar is the best! Highly recommend their chicken picatta and clam linguini with white sua"}
{"text":"This is a spectacular place to eat. Not only is the food amazing, but also the service. You know a meal is going to be good when the bread is to die for. There are so many options you can choose from, and everything is reasonably priced. At North Beach Italian Bistro you don't just eat you dine. And if you don't know what that means you have to go and experience it for yourself. 10/10 would recommend a family dinner night there."}
{"text":"So good! Great atmosphere, great service and surprisingly affordable prices! One of our favorites!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place and all my favorite Italian dishes! I had Chicken Marsala & the chicken was so tender & was served with garlic mashed potatoes & veggies. The service was outstanding too! My guy finds the most romantic places. 

Love this place & the service is excellent! Thank-you Maria!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. We were greeted at the door as if we were family. During our meal we never had to ask to have our water glass filled. if we needed something our server was always close by. The service was just excellent, something you don't see very often. The food was exceptional, the calamari appetizer was some of the best I've ever had. I had the sea Bass and it was excellent. Someone in my party had the steak and shrimp and it was very good. They told me they have only been open six months, I wish them the best success and hope they stay here for years as I will be back many times."}
{"text":"We had this place recommended to us by several different sources, but on the whole it was the most disappointing Las Vegas dining experience I have had to date. Don't get me wrong the service was excellent, the prices were extremely reasonable, but the food... was just crap.

We started with the crab cake appetizer, which was the highlight of the meal. It was just okay, a little on the flavorless side, with more veggies than crab. The bread that was served with the meal had a decent texture, but was almost completely lacking salt. The pasta fagiole soup was likewise very bland, and underseasoned.

Once we got to the entrees, however, things went south. I got the ribeye, which was extremely variable: medium in some parts, well-done in others. I had ordered it medium-rare, no part of it was less than medium. I got a side of pasta with marinara as a side, and this is where I just kind of gave up on the place. Their \"marinara\" was an orangey goo sitting on top of overcooked spaghetti, with watery orange liquid in the bottom of the bowl. It looked like pureed carrots, and tasted like nothing. It was the absence of flavor. 

My lady friend had the shrimp ravioli, which actually had a very pleasant flavor, primarily seafood and mushroom. However, they served it with some butterflied shrimp that were so hammered they were almost inedible. This dish might have been the highlight of the night, if it hadn't made my lady friend ill. Race to the bathroom kinda ill.

All in all, outside of the service, there is absolutely nothing to recommend this place. I am predisposed to favor Italian restaurant, but there is nothing about this place that I would want to return for, especially when rolling the dice with gastrointestinal distress."}
{"text":"Fantastic service AND food!!!  Everything was ABSOLUTELY wonderful!!  The ONLY mild complaint, if you can even consider it a complaint...is the lighting. For a small, romantic setting, the lighting could be dimmed to bring out the atmosphere much better. When we mentioned that, our waiter told us anytime we are dining in one of the booths and wish for the lighting to be dimmed in our booth, they WILL accommodate the request. I just felt it would have MUCH more ambiance with dimmer lighting. Nevertheless, the food, service and experience are WELL worth your time!!  In fact, the lighting was the ONLY reason I gave them one less star."}
{"text":"Authentic and beautiful food and decor.
We had crab cakes( pretty good)
Caesar salad Eggplant parm ( perfecto)
Penne with roasted garlic and olive oil.  also beautiful some Paso Robles Zinfandel our fave and perfect crime brûlée. 
Attention and service five stars!"}
{"text":"We loved our experience at this place.  The menu had offering that you don't normally see at Italian restaurants.  I ordered an aglio e olio pasta dish and it was incredible.  My husband loved his food too.  The bread was great, and the service was superb.  The interior is classy and reminiscent of a place where I might see Italian mobsters dining back in the day.  We brought my service dog and she hung out silently under our large round table.  No one hassled us at all, which is very nice.  There were also raised booths available.  Great place!  I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Made a last minute reservation on Yelp for Mothers day.  Went to this place to be nicely greeted by the host.  Sat us down quickly.  Server was very nice and very helpful and friendly to talk to.  The chopped salad was amazing along with the fresh bread.  I had the chicken Parmesan, so delicious.  My husband had linguine with shrimp and mushroom the sauce was outstanding.  Kids had spaghetti and meatballs.  Generous portions,  food was great.  Overall nice experience and great Italian food in local neighborhood.  Don't know why this place doesn't advertise,  I just found it on Yelp and read reviews.  The place is really small.  Make reservations.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I do five stars when even one of the items that I eat is the best I've ever had. In their case, they have (by far) the best meatballs I've ever eaten. Perfectly moist and exploding with flavor. 

FOOD:

We started off with the beef carpaccio, this was amazing, thin slices of tender heaven. I highly recommend you give this a try for an appetizer. 

We also ordered lasagna, good size portion. The meat sauce was excellent, lots of cheese and the noodles were al dente. 

We ordered several different desserts. Canoli, creme brulee, and some sort of ice cream cake. They were all great, but I'd reccomend the canoli and the ice cream cake. 

SERVICE:
5 stars!!! I wish i remembered her name, but she was extremely friendly and professional. Our drinks were never close to being empty and she was prompt with everything we asked for. The owner came by to make sure everything was perfect. They treated us like family as soon as we walked in the door. 

IN CONCLUSION 

This is about 15 mins off the strip, and well worth the drive. This will be a place I frequent each time I'm in Vegas. Do yourself a favor and come check this place out, you won't be sorry. I'm so glad we drove a little out of the way for excellent food and hospiltality."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this place! Everything was decent to very good for the price and exceeded expectations. The Caprese was very good with flavorful red and yellow tomatoes, fresh basil and olive garnish. The mozzarella was decent. We also started with an antipasti plate of salami, prosciutto, olives, artichokes, and roasted red peppers that was fair for the price. My chicken picatta was very good, as well as the eggplant parm, and pasta pomodoro. The service was excellent and the atmosphere okay. My husband enjoyed the paintings and it was very clean. Try the spumoni for dessert...it was my favorite. This is not a Michelin-starred restaurant, but the food and service was a great value compared to similar restaurants."}
{"text":"North Beach Italian Bistro was the result of wanting to try an eatery close to my home and random Yelping. This, obviously, is not the tactic I should use for future dinner choices. Although this place is cute inside and the service is quite good, I wouldn`t come back here unless someone kidnapped me and we showed up here and I was really hungry.

My party didn`t show up with reservations because we are a bunch of savages, but we thought \"How busy could it be?\". Well, they only had a couple of tables left, so I suppose quite busy, and we had to sit at a table(which I`m just not down with usually because I like booths), but I got over it pretty quick. The water person came over and filled up our cups until they runneth over(not really) and I was happy with the quick service thus far. Then our waitress came over and took our drink order(wine, please! All of it.) and then went away. We were left alone quite some time to our own devices and without bread, but that wasn't a big deal. We actually chatted like humans and it was awesome and then the bread came and that was over. I went into a gluten coma. Bread was delicious and butter is always a welcome food group. There was hope.

Then we put in our orders. I got the rigatoni puttanesca and the other two people in my group got the pasta carbonara and lasagna. Easy. Bring on the food. We ate bread which seemed like forever and it seemed like they were taking quite a while with the food. Not to worry, though, more actual human interaction was taking place. Good times in a world where people never talk to each other.

Food arrived and was pretty underwhelming. My rigatoni puttanesca just didn`t feel exciting and I felt like there wasn't enough sauce. It was just not very good. The pasta carbonara seemed really heavy and greasy and was not finished. The lasagne did seem to go over well, but as a whole the group was not impressed. 

Here is the nail in the coffin, though: We ordered two glasses of wine and they charged us for one glass and one bottle. We had to flag down our waitress and get this corrected, otherwise they would have let us pay for a bottle. Not a huge deal, as mistakes do happen, but it just wasn't a good experience. #ByeFelicia"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. The service, the food and the ambiance was impeccable. Linen on the tables. Greeted at the door with a handshake. Just overly impressed with everything. A quick ride from the strip, will definitely come back for this authentic Italian food. Wow!"}

Short Review:
North Beach Italian Bistro is a local spot in the Northwest that deserves a lot of praise for their excellent customer service, authentic Italian dishes, huge portions, and great entrée prices.  I'm a fan and couldn't wait to tell friends how good this place is.  

Longer Review:
North Beach Italian Bistro has been around for a couple of years now.  North Beach Italian Bistro shares a building with Bogie's Bar right off Ann Road in the Northwest.  The one thing that I immediately noticed that separates North Beach Italian Bistro from Bogey's Bar is the huge aquarium.  I didn't make reservations, but it's highly recommended since this restaurant is small and can fill up quick.  From start to finish, the overall service was awesome.  Our server gave us her recommendations, some insight on the local's favorites, and warned us that the portions are very generous.  Their small salad and a side of meatballs are big enough to feed two.  I got their Chicken Parmigiana, which is served with mozzarella cheese, Pomodoro sauce, and pasta. Our server wasn't lying about the portions for their entrees. The chicken parm that I got was 3 huge pieces of breaded chicken breast.  The meat was tender and the breading was on point.  My belly was satisfied with one breast, but I couldn't help myself.  I finished the whole thing.  Yes, it was that good.  North Beach Italian Bistro is one of those places where you cannot judge quality and portion size by their prices.  Most of their entrees cost around $15 and you get a lot for your money.  The portions are so big that I left stuffed and my fiancé took home leftovers.  Overall, I highly recommend.  Good Job, North Beach!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times now and the food and service have always been great. I love their vodka sauce, it never disappoints and their crab cakes are to die for!"}
{"text":"North Beach Italian is a awesome place to go for drinks and dinner. Oscar the bartender was great a very nice man. A very nice place am definitely going back the prices are not bad at all."}
{"text":"We are regulars now; I love this restaurant and their old-fashioned down home service and friendliness.   I have tried several dishes and are very happy with them.  They are great about changing your order also.  Great happy hour!  If you plan a weekend evening you better make a reservation they get filled up!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! I had the chicken Marsala and my husband had the crab cakes as his appetizer and chicken parmigiana for his main. We both loved the food. The venue itself was nice. And service was really great too! Very friendly ! Looking forward to coming back here with more friends and family."}
{"text":"We are incredibly picky about Italian food, and there is not much choice of eateries where we live. We have a GO TO, but it's in a casino. Sometimes, you just want to avoid that crowd. After watching Lidia Bastianich this afternoon, all we could think of is where the heck can we go to have a decent Italian meal in North Las Vegas. We whip out the reviews sections and find there is one relatively close to us, one we have passed curiously for some time and one we would be willing to risk it for. We were not able to make a reservation on Y**p for some reason, so we figured how bad could the wait be? When we arrived, we were told about an hour. Well that's our fault for not calling ahead. There is a simple bar next door called Bogies, smokers, yuk, but we decided to hang there until a table was ready. It was less then 20 minutes. Now, I have a mother in law that prepares the most amazing Italian dishes. That side of my family is off the boat, and are VERY fussy about their preparations and presentations. So pleasing me is a pretty tall order. We began with a started course, Carpaccio and it was perfect, fresh tender paper thin slices of meat, capers and a beautiful spring mix of greens in the middle with a whisper of Dijon Mustard vinaigrette. We ordered the Pancetta Carbonara and the simple Ravioli. The pastas are all homemade there and the sauces were clean and fresh as well. For dessert we decided to not split this time, and go right for 2 favorites, Creme Brulee (it's HUGE) and there homemade Tiramisu - this little daring was the best I've ever had. The ladyfingers were delicate and again, freshly homeade, and the base it's self was presented with care and, I hate to sound corny, love! We were overwhelmed with how everything was so delicious. I believe we have found a new favorite here in North Las Vegas! I would pop in here just for dessert and a digestif. Beginning to end we had a very comfortable hour and a half and were never tapping our fingers waiting on someone to be there for us. Excellent service."}
{"text":"I really liked this place its cute inside. Great for date night. I got the eggplant parm and it was really good I loved the marinara sauce. My Husband got the alfredo and he did not like it at all there was about 2 inches of grease in the bottom of the bowl and it made him sick. We told the waitress and she just asked if we wanted them to just drain the oil out. Um No lol. A better response would have been to re-make it. Anyways we will probably go back but just never order the alfredo again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars. I really did. Service friendly, great food, nice establishment, AMAZING gnocchi pesto.....however the chicken marsala was practically inedible. It was a small portion, very rubbery yet the veggies were cold and hard as were the mashed potatoes. I absolutely loved everything about our experience so please DO try it out; I just wouldn't get the chicken Marsala. Pumpkin cheesecake was great."}
{"text":"The food was totally awesome and the meatball was the bomb!
Staff was attentive and very personable. Great place for a group or a special date. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Seen it has 4 1/2 stars decided to go for my daughters birthday. The food was amazing the server was respectful, and the rest of the staff all had her back. With a sense of family You can't help feeling a small piece of Italy has come to the las Vegas area."}
{"text":"At first I did not think much of this place due to the half empty parking lot. That perspective changed dramatically real quick once inside. 

First off, the place is beyond amazing for it's luxury. You would think you were on the strip, but nope! Aside from the friendly service, they were very professional and authentic, thus meaning I could barely understand a word of their English being spoken. Table mats are actually made to be drawn on for the kids (pretty cool). As far as the ambience, seating is spread out well so you do not feel so cramped, and it is very quite and has a semi dark romantic theme going on. Definitely should be on your date night list, gentlemen.

Most pricey plate here was only $20. I enjoyed their delicious Capellini ai Fruitti Di Mare. So delicious! Took half an hour for all 5 of our plates to come out and everything was amazing including the steak, calamari, and pizza. (pictures attached)

I will take this restaurant over Olive Garden any day. See you soon, chef!"}
{"text":"Our second visit to North Beach was almost as enchanting as the first.  I say almost, because Ozzie was engaged with a family dinner he was part of, so we had less time to chat than last time.  Still, he managed to make the rounds a couple of times.

We were ably attended to by Oscar, the bartender, and after ordering my customary glass of Riesling, we settled in for another great meal.  Since Mr. G had loved the dish I had last time, he ordered it for himself - the Chicken Sorrentino.  And I couldn't resist it, either.  This time we had a very fresh dinner salad, and substituted linguine for the vegetable and potatoes.  

North Beach is a gem, and easily accessible from anywhere in the northwest of the Strip."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise to have a spot like this in Centennial Hills. Fresh pasta with great sauces, oh yeah!
I have been a few times now,  and I have found you can't go wrong with whatever special the chef has prepared for the day.
It can be a little busy so a reservation can't hurt, but they will usually get you in pretty quickly otherwise."}
{"text":"We recently relocated to Vegas . My son was here visiting and found this  restaurant on Yelp. The food service and atmosphere was amazing. When my husband returned from a business trip I suggested we go here for dinner. He ordered the egg plant  parmigiana  . He was in heaven said it was the best he has eaten since his grandma passed. He is Italian and this is now our favorite place!"}
{"text":"So I went there for the first time today. A friend dragged us all here for dinner. Great place, Food was outstanding, Pasta was made in the kitchen. The prices are great and I can't wait to come back again.

Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and reasonable prices.  I am Italian and do not like eating at Italian restaurants.  But I have to say North Beach was on point with everything!!  Had Eggplant parmagiana and cannoli."}
{"text":"Went their for my wife's birthday. made a reservation on line and of course it never showed up. No problem as the restaurant wasn't busy and we were seated quickly.
We ordered a round of cocktails and they were great and reasonably priced. The appetizers were good but the Calamari was kind of bland but the dipping sauce was fantastic. Dinners went from 3 stars to 5 stars. Two risottos were under cooked and crunchy but the sea bass special was rated highly and the lobster ravioli was also a thumbs up. 
They comped our desserts to cover the under cooked Risottos which was nice.
All in all a good meal, good service and a worth while trip. We would go back again."}
{"text":"Real Italian hospitality and customer service. We were treated like VIP even though we unknowingly came in a half hour before closing time. They genuinely appreciated our  business. The owner made it a point to introduce himself and make us feel welcome. Food was delicious too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant looks like your typical Italian restaurant from the mob times. The decor is nice and the atmosphere is very relaxing. During the weekends they have live music which makes this restaurant even more exciting! I was surprised how cheap the food menu was. The most expensive pasta dish was $15 dollars which seem very reasonable for the restaurant appearance. The bottles of wine raged from $25-$40 dollars. I found this restaurant to be very good for a nice and romantic dinner. 
We ordered the crab cakes which were good, although they are mixed with green and red peppers. I also ordered the linguine with mushroom and shrimp which was very average. Overall, an ok place to visit with an awesome decor."}
{"text":"Can't believe we just realized this was here. Much nicer than we expected and busy for a Sunday night. really good service and food was delish. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for 1 night (used to live here) and had never been to NB Italian Bistro. I get Penne Vodka almost every time I eat Italian and this was, by far, one of the best! Super homemade tasting and delicious! Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Went for my husbands birthday, and we were both just amazed by the friendliness of the staff. The food was absolutely out of this world. Overall best Italian in this city, and cheaper than good ol pre packaged Olive Garden. We will be regulars here!"}
{"text":"This place was great! I decided to try it after reading the Yelp reviews and we were very impressed! The owner, Ozzie, was very welcoming and friendly and the rest of the staff was just as good. We ordered linguini with shrimp and mushrooms, chicken parmesan, and my son had the cheese tortellini. They didn't have a kid's menu but graciously made the tortellini in a kid's portion. All of the food was great! Portion size was perfect and the flavor was amazing. We will definitely be back! The server brought Tiramisu to the table for dessert as a surprise and it was the best I've had at any restaurant in town."}
{"text":"This is a great place for authentic Italian cuisine! I was a bit leery with the name of \"North Beach\" but I decided to try it based on another person's recommendation. The ambience is very romantic. There is low lighting, candles and a beautiful fish tank behind the bar. The service was very friendly and prompt. They had a great selection of authentic Italian cuisine. We tried the Cavatelli alla Caserta and the Rigatoni Putanesca. The cavatelli was delicious, with a rich Bolognese sauce. The dollop of cool ricotta cheese set the dish apart from others. The putanesca was also excellent. It had a rich briny flavor with the pasta cooked out al dente. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice date night."}
{"text":"Wow!!! We read the previous reviews and said-\"OK we'll give it a try!\" We were soooo NOT disappointed. We had chicken piccata and chicken Parmesan and both were fabulous! The service was great, the food was awesome. We will be back!
A NEW favorite Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"When you walk up to the building there will be one set of main doors, but once your in, the bar which another business will be on the right door, and the actual North Beach restaurant is to the left door, but they usually have a hostess there in the front. I sensed the ambience to be a more grown up crowd, which i actually thought was good because there wasn't any crying children when i went. Fun Fact, the bathrooms are really nice. 

We ordered the Crab Cakes. I myself don't care much for crab cakes in general, and honestly these didn't change my mind either. Their good but nothing extraordinary for my taste. Out pastas on the other hand were amazing though. I got on eof their specials of the night which was a crab ravioli served with shrimp in a pink saue. My friend got the Seafood pasta which cam with chucks of lobster, shrimp, and scallops. We were sharing and honestly what made it delicious was her angel hair pasta in my pink sauce. Kinda wish we could of jsut have both plates mixed together.

For Dessert my friend got the Spumoni cake. She will cake abouthis dessert for days. Im honestly not a big sweets person so i thought it was ok. But if you are, i would take her word for it."}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas for over 6 years now and this is the best local restaurant I have ever found. The service is fantastic the atmosphere is very friendly. The martinis are absolutely delicious and the food is extremely good. You will not find a better Italian Restaurant in Las Vegas in my opinion. If you're looking for an Italian restaurant and you have not tried North Beach Italian Bistro you must do so, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went the first time and enjoyed it, the second time was not good at all. Staff is polite and attentive, decent decor, but my Fruiti de mare pasta was bland bland bland and hardly any lobster...just little stringlettes from the joints."}
{"text":"This place is a true hidden gem. We live very close and often forget about it. Do yourself a favor and try this place out. Food is delicious and service is OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"avoid.  I have dined here many times but never again.  The caesar salad is so small that I can not fill up on the large one as my meal since I choose it to be my entree. Lettuce is so expensive that they can not give much in the pricey salad..heh!! The crab cakes are burnt on the outside and raw and cold on the inside. I requested them to be cooked inside.  Bread is sad. There are sooo many other restaurants to select from.  Most of the patrons are way above 75 years old. Looks like the nursing home bused them over here."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with 6 people on Wed night and had a great meal.  The server was very prompt and kept all glasses filled.  The apps were excellent, we had the carpaccio, crab cakes and antipasto.  My DIL really like he Caesars salad.  The seafood pasta was great, as was the cioppino (sp?) and the chicken marsala.  Only 2 issues:  please DON'T bring out the salads at the same time as the apps, it is just wrong.  Also, we ordered lemon drop martinis, which were just martinis, with a lemon wedge added, not very good.  Overall, a very nice place to dine."}
{"text":"Looks like an old strip club....seriously.  There are some items here that are super good and some that are not so great.  I ordered the chicken Marsala and my cousin had the spaghetti with clam sauce.  Both of those items were super bomb.  It was the best chicken Marsala that I've ever had.  My husband had the steak and my cousin's partner had the spaghetti with meatballs.  Both of those were just meh."}
{"text":"Lived in Vegas five years.  We may have found a new favorite restaurant. Food service wine excellent. Nothing else just try it for real Italian done right"}
{"text":"Great little gem in the northwest.  Clean and nice decor inside the restaurant.  The fish tank behind the bar is really cool.  Great wait staff.  Our server, Silvia was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu.  Food was very good.  You could tell the difference when food is fresh and they are using quality ingredients.  I had Caesar salad and veal parm.  Wife had chopped salad and puttanesca.  Both very good.  Can't wait to go back and try some different dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered a half tray of lasagna for my nephew's impromptu birthday party. The dish was big enough for 8 adults and four children. Flavored were great and care was placed into the dish. The owner himself came out to greet us. We will be in for dinner. Thank you so much for getting us out of a bind."}
{"text":"One of the best pasta places I have ever gone too. Highly recommend the calamari and the atmosphere is beautiful. I'll definitely be coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Meatballs. Get the meatballs. 
Had a wonderful, slightly fancy, dinner here with a friend. We showed up on a weekday with no reservation and were quickly seated, but the restaurant was fairly crowded so reservations are surely appreciated. Got a glass of delicious delicious wine and a glass of iced water that was always refilled in a timely manner. Our waiter was one of the owners I believe and he shared helpful tips about the menu. 
We got an order of the meatballs for an appetizer and that was the highlight of the evening. Those were delicious! The eggplant parmigiana was perfectly breaded and lightly fried- not too soggy, but easy to cut with a fork. My friends chicken piccata was well cooked and moist and the sauce was on point. We had creme brulee for dessert and it was a perfect end to our meal. The menu was to be expected for an Italian joint, staff was perhaps a little overly friendly for my taste, and the wine menu had a great selection. Recommended for anyone who wants Italian in a nice surrounding (perhaps romantic?) and is in to the friendly Italian waiter."}
{"text":"Happy New Year!!! This is a wonderful hidden gem of a restaurant. Our first time there and the service and food was Fabulous. I had the Chilean sea bass, and my husband, the Veal Chop. The owners were so gracious and greeted us like family. Needless to say, we will be back. Service is top notch, servers were knowledgeable in menu, everything about our experience was on point!"}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago with my cousin. Wanted to try something different. The food was delicious. I ordered the salmon with sautéed asparagus. I ordered an appetizer Caesar salad, and no lie, it was the best Caesar I've ever had. My cousin ordered the chicken parmigiana, she said it was delicious and the portion was so large that she had enough for lunch the next day. It was about $20 each dish to give you an idea of the price.

I'm taking off one star because the atmosphere is very romantic and date-night like. The interior was beautiful with a fancy old jazz club feel. We didn't realize that when we were coming and it felt as if the waitress just wanted to get us out as soon as possible. Kinda made us feel out of place that we weren't kind of dressed up."}
{"text":"We've been here a lot. 

We tried to order through Postmates, and they cancelled it because they were too busy. 

Not cool. Don't offer your services through a third party vendor if you're not willing to provide that service. You're too busy to make food? Silliness.

We ended up ordering Dom DeMarco's and it was amazing. Thanks for offering your services to sick people who really wanted Italian. *Heart*"}
{"text":"a friend and i enjoyed a wonderful evening of food and wine recently..i believe i had a lovely fresh piece of salmon grilled and sautéed spinach...the owner was present and very personable, charming and attentive along with his long time bartender who waited on us.. 
i strongly recommend this centennial hills italian eatery..."}
{"text":"Walked in and walked right back out. Unless you want to eat a cigarette for dinner or you smoke and don't mind eating smoke then I'd say stay away. I literally could not breath. I can't believe they serve food here.  The barrier between the bar and the restaurant cannot properly contain the fumes. I was sharing my experience with a friend who said the exact same thing happened to her."}
{"text":"Walked in the front door and the entry way smelled so bad of smoke that we couldn't even go any further. I know there is a bar on one side and a restaurant on the other but this was unbearable."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.  My daughters and I went to this delightful Italian bistro.  Delicious food, excellent service and the nicest owner who greater everyone at the door.  Truly wonderful dining experience.  I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"One of the few times that my fellow yelpers have let me down. Went here last night and it simply was not good. The place was busy and had potential. Nice owner greeted us at door and we were promptly seated. Server was nice but felt rushed in ordering.
Appetizer of prusciutto and mozzarella was good, served on flatbread and mixed salad was fine.
My entree of chicken saltimbocca was not good. Hardly any chicken, hard slice of proscuitto, and melted cheese in an oily, unsatifying dish.
The wine list is not very good and my $10 glass of chianti was tough to drink.
Complementary bread on table was not good which is never a good sign.
Much better choices."}
{"text":"I usually don't leave a review unless I really love or dislike a place... unfortunately for North Beach, they get utter dislike. We went based on all the excellent reviews as we were previously leary due to the location & are now left wondering who all these people really reviewed... Got the soup of the day, tasted like the bagged soup in the refrigerator section at the store, actually that store soup has more flavor. Ordered chicken francese & chicken parm (pretty straight forward)... AWFUL! The chicken looked, felt & tasted like over microwaved chicken fingers - the veggies had so much oil on them I'm surprised they didn't slide off the plate long before getting to the table. On top of all this, the service was maybe fair. Can def say we will not be back & I would caution anyone else considering giving it a try. For the same $$ there are many FAR better options! Went to Maggianos in Summerlin a couple weeks ago, AMAZING food, impeccable service & for less $$... no brainer"}
{"text":"Amazing little restaurant. It is small and cozy with a beautiful, classy vibe. The staff were absolutely wonderful. They seated is right away and checked on us without being bothersome. The server provided menu information and suggestions for our meal based on our preferences. The menu had some great options. Everything we had was delicious!"}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing spot, especially after reading all the great reviews. 

You won't find the hostess at the stand, because she is busy drinking red wine at the bar. 
We got seated at a romantic booth with crayons. 
We ordered the crab cakes, the Argentinean(!) empanadas and baked clams that were 90% bread crumbs and 10% clams. All came out way too fast not to have been microwaved. 

As entrees we ordered the angel hair pasta with seafood and the house specialty- ossobuco . Both with way overcooked pasta. The only item tasty this far is the actual veal shank on the ossobuco. Very tender and juicy. Everything else so far you could have skipped. 

Dessert - since there were no fresh berries we decided to go with the tiramisu, an Italian delight? Way too moist and cold from the fridge. And no port or dessert wine to pair with it. 

When we made our reservation we were told they would honor the corkage fee for the bottle of wine we were bringing. We did get charged for it in our check though.........."}
{"text":"Omg! The penne alla vodka is amazing. The ambiance is nice, the service was great, and the food was exceptional! It's definitely on my new list of places to go!"}
{"text":"So glad we took a chance and tried this place. The food is awesome. I had the Cavatelli alla Caserta, simple but decadent with ricotta and thick meat sauce.  The service is genuinely friendly and attentive and prices are fabulous for the quality. A great option in the area for those who are craving Italian and don't want to settle for the overpriced and underwhelming large chain places in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! The food was fresh and delicious. We plan on making this a regular dinner hangout."}
{"text":"Gave it one star only cause I had to give something to register a review. 
Ordered pesto Gnocchi. Was horrid, so much sauce and tang it was like a 5 yr old made it. Gnocchi was like mush balls. I asked to have good taken away and requested caprese salad.  Mozzarella was tough and tomato mushy and old. 
Date ordered spaghetti and meatballs thought he was safe but soggy noodles and bland meatballs. 
Never plan to try this again. Olive Garden would be a few steps down from this place. 
AVOID---"}
{"text":"Osso bucco...ok I took a few bites before the photo but I couldn't resist!! Slight sweetness from the carrots used in the mirepoix. Order with \"little sauce\" as the chef is often over generous with the \"gravy.\""}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food was sub par. I was very disappointed considering how much my bill was at the end of the night. I have NO problem paying for what I get no matter the price, but if it's not even worth the money???? No way. I got the eggplant parmigiano and it was DRENCHED, I mean swimming in marinara, which by the way was close to flavorless. So with my food swimming in sauce, it was also soggy. My husband got stuffed ravioli of some kind, and our friends ordered pizza. Extremely average, if that."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem.  We were recommended by a friend and agreed that the food was authentic Italian.  The Os bucco was a great surprise.  I've never had such great dish in my life.  Make sure you order this specialty dish.  The portion was huge on all the entrees. Tiramisu was awsome.  Service was warm, little slow but attentive.  It felt like at home.
We've already come back several times.
Great place if you are looking for an Italian dinner."}
{"text":"Used to love coming here but the last few times have not been that good.  Tonight was the last time ordered cavatelli with ricotta and the ricotta was spoiled, stepdad ordered spaghetti and meatballs - meatballs were burned pasta was over cooked, mom ordered ravioli which was ok but soggy. Husband ordered coop piano which he said was pretty good but will never t be returning again."}
{"text":"This is a place I used to go too 3-4 times a week for the past few years. I enjoyed sitting at the bar and met many friends. Now things have changed. It seems like the so called mediocre chef is now running the business! The owner Ozzie doesn't seem to control the cook. I use the work cook because he's more of a short order cook then chef! My past experience left me feeling disrespected as a patron and friend. 
I asked to get a grilled chicken sandwich. I've had this many times before. It comes with potatoe salad or French fries. I had been able to sub that for veggies. Didn't matter what they were because they cook them in bulk for other dishes. Last week the chef decided to charge for the veggies for the first time. The owner didn't stand up for me a customer for years that frequented their place. So to me the cook is the boss or the owner doesn't care! I've also will mention the food has become mediocre at best and some of the prices are way too much for the quality! Too bad these things happen but I'll never go back to this place again because there is no loyalty to their patrons. I know I'm only one person and they probably could care less. So, I feel the same..there are other places near by better food and more friendly. Took me only two days to find better locations closer to my home!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem. When we pulled up, we thought it was a gaming place. However, it is also an amazing and beautiful Italian restaurant. It is family owned, has amazing food, and a wonderful staff. It has only been open a year and the word needs to be heard about this place. A local favorite indeed!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is probably one of best Italian restaurants in town. The food is only outdone by the fabulous service. You really feel like you are family here   The owner(Ozzie) is always on hand to assure your eating experience is delightful. We eat here weekly and always take our out of town guests here   No matter where you are coming from in Vegas you can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"I came across this listing on Yelp as I was browsing restaurants. Then I had forgotten about it . . . . . . until last Saturday.  I had a late big lunch earlier that day,  and I didn't want to eat a huge dinner, and I didn't feel like waiting for seating for an appetizer. 
That's when I remembered about this place. I wanted to go and check-it-out.
5 stars -
Although, all we had was delicious bread, calamari and some fantastic salads, it was very tasty, and eloquently presented. 
The white table clothes and professional-staff members gave me a very welcoming feeling.
Our service was so pleasant, that originally I was going to eat and run, instead - after our meal, I ordered coffee and dessert.

EVERYTHING was so clean and well maintained, it made it a very cozy and comfortable atmosphere. 
So. . . . not that I have ever posted a comment about the restroom, but, this place....... well, go see for yourself. - 5 STARS for sure!!!

North Beach Italian Bistro, I will be back, with a bigger appetite!"}
{"text":"The reason for my low rating is that their menu on yelp brought us here. Veal of all kinds $19.95 but they say that's a 3 year old menu and showed me their menu on their web site. It's up to them to keep yelp updated
and I feel that a cold business gesture would have been to honor what they have on yelp! Instead they choose
To tell me they never posted that menu.
Never had this issue with any of the hundreds of restaurants we have eaten at.
I had the veal and the portion was so small I was still so hungry. The owner does not care at all 
Now he has offered a free desert!"}
{"text":"I'm a repeat customer and have brought many couples. All agree that they are one of the best Italian restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was by far the best Italian food I've had in a while! I highly recommend the bruschetta and the seafood pasta! Service was great, had a reservation and were seated upon arrival. The noise level is fairly loud but there were a lot of people in the restaurant. From the outside it appears to be a dive but the inside is nice. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Glad we stopped in!  Food was great, staff was friendly and engaging, and it's not overpriced!!!  Chicken Marsala was very tasty!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has cheap prices and cheap food.  If you do not know what Italian food really tastes like, this is your place.  We had the following:
1. Salad Mixta: salad was served with rotted lettuce.  Replaced with plain romaine.
2. Spaghetti with meatballs: spaghetti was overcooked, plain white wheat pasta with little or no taste, the sauce was a runny pink sauce with no taste, served cold, the meat balls were of a strange texture and not edible.
3.  Chicken Milanese: one large piece of fried chicken, plain, not Milanese
4.  Chicken Francaise: one large piece of fried chicken (same as above) with a gloppy tasteless sauce, not Francaise.
5.  Eggplant Parm: eggplant covered with an oily, tasteless cheese.
6.  Vegetables: large pieces of squash and some carrot pieces, cheap.
7.  The restaurant was attractive but so noisy we could not hear each other (4) talk.
This food resembles airport food.  It reminds you of the real thing but is not.  Cheap and cheap food.
8.  The wait staff was excellent but this does not compensate for the food.  There are many good and great Italian restaurants in Las Vegas, but this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Nice intimate setting & decoration, but the food wasn't as expected and took 40 mins to be served. I ordered Cioppino, which didn't look at all like the picture I found on here. There's also a bar on the right side in the front entrance for 21 years old & up. We came here on a Friday night & parking was packed. Pricing was good though. Make sure to reserve a table!!!"}
{"text":"Crab cakes and shrimp ravioli were great.  However,  the Creme Brulee was so disappointing it left me with a question mark instead of an exclamation point at the end of the meal.

Service from the staff was good.  The bar area was a bit loud as it is in the dining room. 

Overall, a 3 1/2."}
{"text":"What a beautiful hidden gem! This is definitely a classy joint. As soon as you walk in, you will have two choices... The bar with the gaming. Or, the restaurant with a little bar. We chose the main restaurant. There is a beautiful fountain on the left-hand side & a bar with a TV on the right-hand side. We sat in a booth. There are gorgeous paintings all throughout the restaurant. The food was delicious. We were served complementary warm bread & butter. For the appetizers, we chose the fried calamari and crabcakes. The fried calamari was perfect. It came with a very delicious sauce. The crabcakes had a little too much filling for my liking, but, they were still rather delicious. Everybody enjoyed their main entrée. I chose the eggplant Parmesan with a side of pasta Alfredo. Both were very delicious. We also had the Tiramisu for dessert. It tasted like it was house made. Extraordinary! All in all, we really enjoyed our dining experience. We will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Italian food in a lovely restaurant.  Owned by guy who owned North Beach Restaurant on Decatur and Sahara.  Service and ambience are top notch.  Pasta, seafood dishes, meatballs and chicken dishes are all good.  Best cannoli on the west side.  Nice wine pour by the glass and good bar.  Worth the drive out to Ann Road."}
{"text":"Went on 10-04-14 with three friends. Food took 48 minutes to arrive.  Appetizer never showed up.  However, the waitress was nice enough to bring two free desserts for the mix-up.   We were the youngest ones in the place by 50 years.  On the night we went, there was a live singer struttin' around crooning Sinatra to all the little old ladies with blue hair. Food was pretty darn good, but Olive Garden is cheaper and faster."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, extremely friendly people. ....say hi to Basil the bartender. ..he is a MIchigan State Spartan fan but he is still nice."}
{"text":"This was recommended by a friend. It's ok inside plenty of seating. Staff was friendly. Two sizes of pizza available a seven and a ten inch. Not too too much size difference. Choice of a few different sauces and cheeses then toppings. It's brick fired oven is fast since it's a very thin pizza. It tasted ok for the value but nothing to rush back to.  Would go back if in the area again."}
{"text":"Finding places like this makes me happy I use Yelp. Excellent service from the minute you walk in the door. Our service Oscar was polite and very prompt.the food is excellent and I am very picky about Italian food i.e. I don't eat at Olive Garden . It was a great find and definitely visit again when I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"All of the reviews claim it's a hidden gem,... and they are right!!! Although technically you don't need a reservation if it's a larger party its probably advisable. The Osso buco exceptional! (Veal with sauce and pasta)   Each neighborhood has its spot and this is definitely legit!  Try the empanadas ( Ozzie recipe) with the chimichuri (Oscar flair) not an Italian thing but definitely a must. Looking local you have found it! Thank you Gabriel and Patty!"}
{"text":"This place is really a hidden treasure. Beautifully decorated and nice intimate atmosphere. Our waiter (forgot his name) was very attentive and didn't bother us. The food was excellent! It's been very hard trying to find a good Italian restaurant in Vegas. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I was yelping today for a new local hang out for good Italian food ... 

I found it. 
I went in tonight, and was greeted by the friendliest staff, and get this, also their customers. 
I noticed that almost everyone who came in the door, greeted one another, by first name no less. It's a local place wherein, it seems, everybody  knows your name ;) 
Exactly what I was looking for as I'm new to Las Vegas but mind you, they welcomed me as if I were a regular as well 

Oscar was the bartender extraordinaire 
. They treat you much like Italians in my family do.... like family .... 
I stopped in and saw they had happy hour drink specials. Oscar made a perfect rum punch. He was very kind to suggest a pasta for me, once I told him my likes and dislikes. And he chose very well, I loved my shrimp and mushroom pasta... I'm a bit of a garlic addict. So I wish I would have had the chef add more because I know they would have, happily done so 
But other than light on the garlic (for my personal taste) I can't say I would make any suggestions or improvements and I love it when there's enough food to take a doggy bag home. And... there was 

I was sinful and ordered the tiramisu to go. It was also excellent. 
I think I've found my new hang out 

Cleanliness was on point. Atmosphere was fantastic, (white table clothes yes, but  don't shy away. The prices on the menu were very reasonable) !! 
The far wall had a water feature and ambiance is very welcoming 

No doubt I will be back 
If you stop in. Say hello to Oscar, he's so very friendly and helpful. 
Now I didn't go in to the right (bar and gaming area I believe) I chose the restaurant side. It's as easy and choosing a door when you walk in. Best of both worlds and you chose what ambiance you prefer. 

Owners are on hand to greet you with a huge smile and a kind word as well 

This is a restaurant that once you come here, I think it will call your name to come back. I just left there and I want to go back already ;)"}
{"text":"This place wasn't on our list of places but found it because we were starving! Kinda of hidden and small but very welcoming! It was great. The little neck clams with a red pepper sauce (I think) was incredible. The Veal Osso Bocco (sp) was to die for!! The fettuccini was so perfect! Oscar our waiter was great, he seemed to be a seasoned vet, and made the whole experience very comfortable. Thank you sir! We drank water and ice tea for my girl and it didn't matter if we ordered wine like some places. We dressed in shorts and a clean T shirt and it wasn't frowned upon. We will be back, no doubt for the little neck clams at the very least! Thanks for a great dinner and a place we will return for great Italian!!"}
{"text":"Food and service were awesome. Most places don't put enough sauce on their pasta...this place put enough sauce! :) I had the linguine with shrimp and mushrooms, and my boyfriends chicken parmigiana was excellent."}
{"text":"I can't believe the high reviews for this place. All the food we ordered was terrible. The meatballs are mushy and flavorless. I added chicken to my penne alla vodka. The chicken was as dry as jerky and there was enough truffle oil to drown out all other flavors. The Caesar salad was bland. Service was good but the food was really terrible."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!!! The best restaurant on this side of the strip.  The service was spectacular.  Bread was amazing! I had the chicken Parm and my husband had the pesto gnocchi. I'm not a pesto fan, but I am now!!!  Parm was also great!! I can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"Great local place. The service was great and so was the food. We had chicken parm and lasagna and both meals were excellent. We went on a busy weekend night without a reservation and they were able to get us a table. I highly recommend this place."}
