{"text":"this is one of my family's go-to dim sum restaurants. We don't come here often though because of the long waits for a table. What draws us back, is the cha Siu here. It's a must!! For under $9 you get fresh and tasty cha Siu, big portion with a bowl of rice on the side! Other dim sum are pretty good too.  Other than the long waits for a table, another little nuisance is the parking here. Never turn into the little plaza where the restaurant is, because there's no space reserved for the restaurant itself! The spaces there are all reserved for other stores in the plaza. So, drive into where the keg is and park there instead, then walk up the small slope to get to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Expensive for Chinese food, but so worth it. A clean and professional atmosphere.  We went for dinner, and were seated and served promptly. I don't know much about Cantonese food, but was told from the Catonese people eating with me, that the food was really good. I loved the Peking Duck. For $5 extra, you can get lettuce wraps to go with the leftover meat of the duck.  I was happy I went with people who spoke Cantonese. I think it would have been a more difficult experience if no one did."}
{"text":"This place has table cloths and beautiful looking dim sum. Only thing I don't like is the lineup during their discounted tea period in the morning - a great deal - everything is $2.90 before 11am."}
{"text":"went there for dim sum all three times. I have to say, their shrimp dumpling, the steam rice roll with beef was so yummy. and i love their steamed Egg Yolk Cream Bun!!! pretty much liked everything. i heard they have good duck, might try... but i still want to go for dim sum!"}
{"text":"Food is good 4.5, service 4, parking is limited 3. Not many selection of food if you don't like seafood, but the ??? is quiet good ($60, need to make reservations)."}
{"text":"Dragon boat!  I love the sport, but not so much this restaurant lol. Theres really nothing to comment about. Their food is okay, service not as great, but hey its a chinese restaurant, what can you expect from the minimum wage waiters/waitresses? Even though its nothing to wow about, my family and I would go have dim sum from time to time here lol -_- Not the cheapest either."}
{"text":"we are new to Toronto, but have tried a few dim sum places, this is our favorite so far.  nice food and environment with decent services, the only issue is the waiting time, we heard its a popular place, so tried be there as early as possible, like before 930, the waiting time is generally an hour long, at least. and they opens at 9am. the mnger said people wait outside before they even open the door during the wknd. I guess we cant compete with them  :-p but once u got a table, just enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Food is very good compared to other dim sum places, price also decent, wait time is very long if you go there after 9:30 because it's so popular..."}
{"text":"This is a story about two hungry people and a case of blatant prejudice. Curious to know more? Read on.   After reading the excellent reviews and conferring with a friend/dim sum connoisseur, my dining partner and I were very excited to visit Dragon Boat this past weekend. \"One of the best spots in the city!\" and \"An absolute must visit!\", we were told. And based on the lineup out the door, it seemed at first glance that we were correct.   Unfortunately that was not out experience.   After a 35 minute wait to be seated (we were expecting that), we were shown to our table. It took us an additional 15 minutes to have our order taken...and that's when then the waiting really began. Normally in a restaurant this busy, you would be willing to excuse a lengthy wait. Not so the case when all the other diners around you - including those seated 20 minutes after you - are already tucking into delicious plates of steaming dumplings. We couldn't help but wonder if it had anything to do with the fact that we were the only Caucasians in the restaurant; what possible other explanation could there be when everyone else was being waited on hand and foot while we were being so blatantly ignored? After 10 minutes of no food and nobody checking in on us, we were suspicious; after 20 we were disappointed and frustrated; and after half an hour we were downright angry.   We left before the food arrived - our server never once trying to stop us and make things right. We turned back for one final glance at the delicious looking food that we never got to taste, and headed for another restaurant where prejudice wouldn't get in the way of our lunch."}
{"text":"e.  They gave us a private room big enough for two tables and lots of room for mingling.  Service was responsive with our own server for the two tables and the food was overall good.  The roast suckling pig had crispy skin, which was good.  Slightly disappointed that there was not enough \"white\" meat - most of the meat was close to the bone and of the darker kind.  The other two appetizers, the fried crab claw and shrimp with scallops were well made, except the so-called \"jumbo\" scallops were hardly jumbo.  But they were nicely presented with crispy snow peas and yellow zucchini.  The special order winter melon soup was tasty but too much meat and not enough seafood.  The crispy skin chicken was superbly done as were the double seabass - perfectly steaned,  Lobster was fresh and tasty, big enough for twelve.  The highlight at the end was the fried five grain rice and the melt in your mouth warm peanut cookie, obviously made in house.  Overall a good dinner with responsive service."}
{"text":"Either this restaurant got a lot of high ratings on Yelp or it is a local's favorite. I went there on 2 separate occasions for their dim sum and there was an hour wait each time. The first time we went, we got there around 10AM on Thursday, we didn't get seated until after 11AM. The 2nd time we got there right when the restaurant just opened at 9AM on a Saturday and it was packed already. I was the first one on the waitlist and we had to wait until 10AM to get seated. Let's say the quality of the dim sum is up to par and if you go there before 11AM all their S, M & L dim sum are $2.80 each. We almost tried everything on their menu. I highly recommend the fish dumpling soup which is not one of the $2.80 dish but worth trying. Also - I like their steamed salted egg yolk bun. I will come back to this restaurant but I'll make sure I'll go before 9AM or after 12PM"}
{"text":"Even with the over the top Chinese restaurants (eg crown prince etc) popping up lately I still think Dragon Boat is one of the best places for dim sum.   The dishes are fresh and relatively priced good.  The chicken feet are flavorful and saucy.  They also have those Portuguese pies that are tasty and aren't found everywhere.   I've only been there for dinner a couple of times and it's decent but not as good as for dim sum. Overall this place is good for the value and it's dim sum is \"consistently\" good!"}
{"text":"A more accurate way in describing this place is a Chinese Restaurant that serves its food with good presentation. I know this restaurant is getting good ratings but I came here for dinner so my experience may have been different compared to the Dim Sum.  Personally, I found the food served at dinner time here was mediocre. It may be because I'm more used to the traditional Cantonese styled foods and this was more of a 'fusion' feel to it. Regardless, the 4 pound lobster I ordered that was to be stir fried in ginger and green onion was pathetic. 1) It was sooo small compared to other restaurants 2) there was hardly any flavour to it and 3) meat did not exist on this lobster. It was very sad. The only highlight here for me was the Crab Meat & Fish Maw Soup (where they actually used a ton of crab meat) and the Fried Rice. Nothing else was that memorable since this restaurant is more serviced towards banquet styled food. Meh."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant! Great service and atmosphere. The seafood and main courses are fresh and reasonably priced. There is a long line up, I recommend making a reservation before you go."}
{"text":"Loved our experience here. Finally got a chance to come here after hearing good things! We ordered a few default dimsum items and the char siu fan. The dimsum portions were fairly large and quality was excellent. Their char sui was wonderful -- moist with some fat :)"}
{"text":"I have been here a lot of time. The food is always good but the waiting time here is the headache unless I came after 13:30 it will be less busy.  Anyway, this is one of the best dim sun place. If you have plenty of time. This place I will strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I think it is the best dim sum I had within a year. But they don't offer promotion on weekend.  Their food portion is very decent.  The fish ball soup is homemade.   But they served food very slow.  Remember to arrive be of 9am for line and get a table"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Dim Sum places in the GTA.  Siu My had shrimp and scallop along with pork.  The deep fried squid tenticles were lightly coated with garlic and were crisy (not greasy) and an absolute must-have."}
{"text":"Terrible experience for waiting almost 1.5 hour for a 3 people table. The reception not call the number follow the rules. They insert a lot people without the number what they call \"reserve\".  They scam your number ! Which if you really call they won't reserve for you! Food used to be ok however it not worth to waiting for so long time. We choose this restaurant because it close to our hotel. But I won't come again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant knows how to take reservations but not how to hold reservations. Kept us waiting 40 minutes when our entire party was there a few minutes early. Other people waiting had similar comments. That said, the dim sum was amazing. After trying many restaurants around the GTA and Hong Kong this is definitely one of the best. Their baked BBQ pork buns were as good as, if not better, than Hong Kong's famous Tim Ho Wan. Will definitely go back but not before a light snack to help with the wait time. Bathrooms could be cleaned more frequently given the high volume of customers."}
{"text":"Very crazy busy restaurant. I have no idea why. Yes, the food is good but is it worth the 45 mins wait if you come at 1:30PM? You'll need to come at 3PM if you do not want to wait for a table. And yes, people cheat and cut in line, what the hell!"}
{"text":"Came here with two friends; they liked dim sum so I decided to take them here due to the high rating this place has. Looks like a nice clean place without going overboard on the decor. It is a pretty busy place, though we only took about 5 min to get seated.   They have a lot of selection along with the usual favourites, and the dim sum varied between really good and pretty good. Their rice noodle rolls were done well, and my friends enjoyed the har gao and the siu mai, which were their favourites.   It took a bit of time for our food to first arrive, but it probably felt longer because we were hungry and we saw food arriving at other tables. Once the first few dishes came, the rest were very timely. They are also very timely with hot water refills for tea.   Best dim sum experience I've had, would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This dim sum restaurant is pretty good.  My boyfriend and I did not wait long for a table for 2 on a Sunday afternoon compared to other dim sum restaurants where the wait could be at least an hour or more.  Do go early on the weekend like before 12 noon because they do run out of dim sum dishes.  The dishes did come at a reasonable time, the wait time wasn't so bad.  The staff were really nice and attentive.  The dim sum dishes are pretty good but it was pricey.  They do take credit card so this was nice.  We will go back but a lot earlier in the day."}
{"text":"It is a huge restaurant but this place is always busy. If you are in the mood for authentic chinese cuisine, I would highly recommend this place. It is slightly pricey but  the portion sizes are decent so best to share in a group. They had very few tables for parties under 6 people. Most tables were for 10-12 people. Definitely make reservations before going."}
{"text":"Their dim-sum food selection is very good.. However, the wait is horrid because they have 3 lists: 1. regular walk in 2. reservation people (recommend to do it but it still means that you line up after the 3rd list) 3. their regular customers who will walk ahead and stand behind Judy the hostess. then they sneak in slowly.   therefore, you have to prepare to wait and tolerate the people from list #3 to go ahead of you.   Their hostess Judy may feel sorry for you and let list #1 to go in after one hour, but it is not ideal.   so, I will recommend to find another place and pay more money instead.  but if you can wait for an hour or two, then go ahead and enjoy their food. but don't order their latest dim sum cage. it is expensive and the food is like a collection of left over dim-sums.  recommended dim-sum: shrimp dumpling, soup filled pasty dumpling, special fried rice."}
{"text":"That place is pretty small. Foods are A OK not bad but not very impressive. They have a few more different choices than the others. I originally wanna give them 3 1/2 or 4 stars but too mush MSG and found a hair in one of the dishes but the server exchanged it for me though. I will give them one more chance."}
{"text":"Extremely impress with their Dim Sum!!!  This will be my go to place for now when I crave Dim Sum!!!  We were there week day around 1230PM.  Small lunch crowd.   Food arrival time was ok.  But all the Dim Sum were Hot and Fresh!!!    Must visit when you're up town!!!  ps.  Before Dragon Boat, our go to was Shangri-La.... Also, best steam egg yolk bun ...comparable to the best in Hong Kong!"}
{"text":"Better than Casa Imperial. Also check out their special $2.80 each if ordered before 11am."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with Dragon Boat.   Pros: - Free tea for the table.  - I recommend the fried octopus legs dish and durian pastries.  - Friendly (but rushes) waiters.   Cons: - There was a really long line even though we went on a Thursday morning. It was about a 30 min wait.  - The bowls and teapots were old and chipped. - The selection wasn't great. - The food was good, but I had higher expectations especially after such a long wait.  - Like a lot of Asian restaurants, there were displays of fish inside. However, the displays here were packed with large dead fish. It was really unappealing and a bit creepy."}
{"text":"We went here for dim sum and it was very good.  The prices were as follows:  small - $2.80 medium - $3.80 large - $4.80 Xlarge - $5.80  If you go Mon-Fri (excluding holidays) 9am-11am (order by 10:50am) all dishes are $2.90.  The restaurant was bright and airy and looked very clean.  They had tiles instead of carpet which makes the place look more clean.  They had nice table cloths which were clean and weren't stained.  We ordered a bunch of different dishes and they were all very good. For the cheung fun there was a good amount of filling.  Unlike some place which only gives you a few pieces of meat sliced really thin.  Everything was also very fresh.  All the dishes were good quality.  The sticky rice in lotus leaf also had a nice amount of filling.  While most places just give you lots of rice.   There was also a good variety of desserts to choose from but alas they ran out of sweet tofu.  This always happens to me!  I ended up having the sago pudding and duck egg bun. Both were tasty.  They brought you tea and another teapot with hot water which I like so I don't have to ask for more tea.  The service was definitely above average for a Chinese restaurant as the servers were all very nice and attentive and checked on us when we were waiting a while.  Most wait staff in Chinese restaurants usually looked annoyed you are asking them to do their job in the first place.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is pricey, but is a decent portion and tastes great. We went to this place numerous times for dim sum. We try to go before 11am as thats when you can get the dim sum prices special. Be warned that if you don't make a booking, expect long wait times. Typically 30-45 minutes, especially on holidays.  Food always comes out hot, fresh, and very nicely presented."}
{"text":"The dim sum was OK.  I would not recommend the chicken pot pie.  They were very small, I personally feel they were smaller than egg custard tart. The filling was mainly curry paste and I didn't see much chicken. The baked BBQ pork bun also did not have much meat filling, mostly bread.  I also didn't like the egg tart with egg white only.  They just tasted sweet without the egg flavor.  The worst was the vegetarian bean curb, the filling was mostly cabbage or napa, not flavorful at all."}
{"text":"We were told to 'find our own seats.' What is the point of telling us to line up if you are just going to send us on a race to claim our table?! Previous experience at this restaurant led us to talking to a very rude boss. We left something at the restaurant and he was completely unwilling to assist us.  I find that restaurants run by Chinese people have a greater chance of having vile service."}
{"text":"Dang! Pretty awesome dim sum! I could eat two dishes of shrimp dumpling (8 pieces) on my own! Order before 11AM and you can get an awesome deal for awesome food, why not? Their egg pastry is a bit on the smaller side but still pretty yummy. The sui mai, shrimp rice rolls, tripe and thousand layer cake are all very good. I live downtown, but would rent a car any day just to have good dim sum here, compared to what I've had downtown."}
{"text":"Usually come here for Dim Sum and love what it has to offer. Like many other reviews suggested, get here early- we usually get a table by 9am latest to avoid the queue. And there is ALWAYS a line up.   My friends and I decided to switch it up a bit and come here for dinner. We made reservations as the place is usually busy, good thing we did b/c the place filled up within an hour after we arrived. There are set dinners and individual dishes to choose from. We got the pumpkin and seafood soup (~$15), Yeung Chow fried rice (~$15) and a veggie dish (~$15). Not the cheapest chinese food you can get in the area, but definitely worth the price and the portions are generous as well. We had left overs of the fried rice and we were stuffed! They also gave us complimentary desserts which included Chinese pastries and red bean soup. Loved the red bean soup most as it was not too sweet."}
{"text":"Probably the best Dim Sum place I have encountered so far in my 2 years here in Toronto!  Like any typical dim sum restaurants, there is a line-up for about 20 minutes before you are being seated. When you are seated, you can tell right away that they put some thoughts into small details. Typical dim sum places use typical tea cups and teapots, the place is different, Their tea cups and teapots are a little higher end than normal. The teapot's handle are easier to grab which makes it easier to pour tea without burning your hand and dripping all over the table. Next, the bamboo containers that hold all the steam food, they are also specially made with the restaurant's logo on it, plus they are square-size, not the typical \"round-size\" containers. You can tell that the owners put some thought into making the dining experience a little more memorable.  No matter how unique a restaurant's table placement is, if the food is subpar, no one will come back. I am glad to report that the food here is amazing as well! On the menu, there are a few items that are \"must try\" - do give them a try. All the food come super hot and super tasty, as dim sum is meant to be. The menu also has a special price if you place your order before 11 am.  In short, I will definitely recommend people to try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about here. It is now my all time favourite dimsum restaurant. Sorry rol san *covers eyes*  The giant juicy Siu mai keeps you coming back. Try going before 11:30am. Early bird special $2.9 for all dimsum size dishes. I ordered and ate so much. I wanted to keep eating but I was scared I would puke due to bloatedness. Service is also great,my plates were consistsntly changed and the staff was enthusiastic they didnt look like they hated their job at all!!"}
{"text":"Service: poor  We made a reservation yet somehow had to wait 35 minutes because it basically means nothing here. Also had to write out my order for the server because she didn't speak English.  Food: awesome  We had the beef and black bean hofun, eggplant green beans and pork, and the thousand islands shrimp all ranked from best to worst   Overall great place if you're not in a hurry"}
{"text":"This is one of my fav dim sum and dinner places. I think I prefer dinner here though, the sizzling beef, fried oysters, and soy sauce chicken are some of the go to dishes for my family. As for dim sum, anything with seafood especially shrimp is a yummy bet!"}
{"text":"Good quality of food. The have special for dim sum at $2.80 per dish even on the weekends. However, it is a pain to go on weekends as the restaurant is packed. The tables are way too close to each other. Waiters/waitresses kept kicking the stroller of my newborn. It looks so dangerous with food being served over your head.  Also, there are not so many parking space near the restaurant. You will need to park outside the office building right across from the restaurant (only on the weekends, week nights and public holidays)."}
{"text":"Good food, nice people , fast services , love that"}
{"text":"Love their Peking Duck though the price is high, but that is definitely the best one I had. Will come back again when they are not busy."}
{"text":"The dim sum is really good and fresh. Waiter service is a hit or miss. Don't pay the bill until you are done eating, they will physically clean the table while you are still eating. Food is a 4 but customer service is between a 2 or 3."}
{"text":"As the restaurant opens at 9am, my friend and I came at 8:45am on a Saturday morning (today) and a small line had already started. They opened the doors and everyone went and picked their own seats. We filled out the order immediately since we knew what we wanted and gave it to one of the wait staff. 5min later someone asks us what tea we wanted. 30min goes by, people start getting their food. Another 15min goes by and we hadn't received anything, not even our order forms back and at this point we were getting very impatient since we were actually the first people to give it in at 9am. 5min later we ask a man with glasses if our order went through and where was our order form. He says \"it's coming, it's coming\" and waves us off. He then comes later with our order form and it looks like the order was placed at 9:36am. We asked another waiter who passed by what was happening with our order and he said it's normal to wait. But we said people who sat down after us had already finished eating. He said I'll check for you and a few min later said \"it's coming\".  We finally get our first dish at around 10:05am. The other dishes came around 10min later. The food was average. The best thing there was the baked egg white milk tarts. We ate for 15min and then took some stuff to go and paid.   I won't be going back. Average food plus shitty service and no dim sum special before 11am on weekends is totally not worth the 40min drive it took to get there. There are so many other good dim sum places around."}
{"text":"Been here like 5 years ago.   And what pissed me off is the greeter, JUDY!   She lets people in without waiting nor reservation.   For god sake.   There is like 30 people waited for at least 45 mins!   What kinda of service is this?    Unacceptable.   Fast forward to 2017.   JUDY is still here.  And I called prior coming.  And the restaurant said no reservation during 9-11am.   So I give it a try and hope that their service improve.  The result is. Beyond terrible.  I was waiting for like 45min.  A women walked in and asked Judy table for 3.   Soon the lady got the table.  Which was suppose to be mine.  I guess next time just come in and ask for JUDY!   No need to wait!   Parking is terrible.  Only 10 spots for the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"They have good quality dim sum for flat rate pricing of $2.90 per item ..food is fresh and tasty..good choice in the markham/richmond hill area if you're not looking to spend $20+ a head for dim sum  also the place is nice and clean which is a huge plus for chinese restaurants especially with the flat rate pricing for dim sum"}
{"text":"I'll be honest; I've never been there for dim sum however I've been here a few times for dinner with my family. Yes they are expensive however it is worth every penny in my opinion.  Last time I went there was for my birthday dinner. There were about 5 adults and 2 kids (under the age of 6). When we first walked in we were greeted and had a table within 10 minutes. They were nice enough to give us a spot right by their HUGE fish tanks so the children could be entertained throughout dinner.    We ordered right away. Sorry I don't remember the proper names of the dishes so bare with me. We had a wonderful plate of SHRIMP just blanched in water with a nice spicy soya sauce for dipping. The shrimp were fresh and when you dip it into the sauce it makes the shrimps sweetness stand out.   Next dish was the Peking Duck. They slice the duck right in front of your table which helps build the suspense of tasting and eating it since you can see the wonderful juices dripping off the duck. It was amazing. Their Lettuce Wrapped with Diced Duck Meat was pretty good as well, nothing super special about it but it was executed well.   Now if you come here for DINNER, you MUST try their BBQ PORK and SIRLOIN STEAK. They are beyond amazing. The steak is melt in your mouth delicious and their BBQ Pork is so good that you will not be able to forget it.   Afterwards you get your typical Chinese desserts and they are done well. Their service was great. Never had to wait too long for anything, none of our orders were missing either. Overall, it's a great place to go for dinner. The kids LOVE their huge fish tanks with lobsters and crabs the size of a baby. =)"}
{"text":"We came in on a Wednesday night and they were so busy. My husband went to check us in and I followed up. When I talked to the guy at almost 8pm (our reservation was for 7:30), he told us it might be still a while as they were still seating people with 7pm reservations! I was furious... For one we had a baby and an elderly couple waiting with us. The reason for making a reservation was so that we would not have to wait. After we were seated, the service was still exceedingly slow. It took so long to get our orders in as we couldn't flag anyone down. My son already threw a tantrum at this point. By then we were ready to give up and just leave. I decided to stay as we were all hungry and I was hoping the food would be good. In the end, food was just ok, not particularly any better than other fine dining Chinese places we have tried. I know food might be better if we ordered differently but after the atrocious service we received, I don't feel like I would ever go back."}
{"text":"Get there early as it is super popular with a long lineup outside. Simply Amazing Dim Sum. Fresh flavorful and beautiful presentation at a very reasonable price.  Best in the Dim Sum in the GTA."}
{"text":"Came for dim sum on a Sunday morning.  Cost, there is no longer an early bird special for weekends.  It is only for weekdays, so do make note of that when you go.  I would say the cost is average for dim sum.  Food, we ordered a lot of dim sum when we came and overall, I was happy with what we got.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was really wowing me either.  Their har gow comes with a full shrimp!  The portion sizes seem to actually make sense since the actual size/quantity of dim sum seemed to change based on what we ordered (the honey korean ribs for example come in a big plate instead of your usual dim sum sized plate).  Atmosphere, the place is nicely decorated, although clearly not able to handle the amount of customers that they have.  I came at 9:55am on a Sunday and it took us about 30 minutes to get a table (hostess said 40 so it was a good guess).  You do get separate chopsticks for sharing (green ones) which not all places have.  I did notice that they didn't seem to clean their plates/cups well, so do check that.  Also, a lot of the ceramics had chips in it (plates, bowls, spoons, cups).  Service, they do seem to come wait the tables often which is nice.  We never had to call anyone to come fill our teapots and they even switched our plates since they were dirty/full of bones.  When we asked for water, they actually brought out bottled waters which we weren't charged for!  Tips, parking in the area is bad.  Since it was the weekend, everyone just parks at the business parking lot just down below but I'm not sure how it works on a weekday.  This is dim sum by paper, not by cart.  I wouldn't come back any time soon, but only because there are so many options to try nearby."}
{"text":"Don't know what's the big deal with this restaurant.   Food are just mediocre.    And the ticketing system then have is non existing.  The fact is of you know Judy then you will get a table.  It's ridiculous.   I witness two tables that happened that were given to a customer that climes to know Judy.  It is the most funniest and yet very frustrated when this happen before your eyes.  I mean if you do this behind those ppl who have been waiting for the like more then an hour.  You see that these folks comes in few mins and gotten a tables.   This is very funny with the Chinese culture."}
{"text":"Wow, they have amazing dim sum. Everything was delicious. Same stuff you might do not like, for example eel rolls but this is just because you do not used to the taste. My husband didn't like it but I did. I would recommend steamed tendon. It is very unique and delicious. Also book a table few days before then you will wait only 10 minutes :-). Otherwise you probably need to wait half an hour. The service was very good what is unusual for Chinese restaurants. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away in a very hidden plaza on east beaver creek road. Honestly took me a bit of time to find it but thanks to google gps I was able to locate this restaurant.   First impression was it was spacious and and can seat a big crowd.  We came here for a company dinner and ordered 10-12 dishes off their menu.  Every dish was up to par with how they were presented without compromising taste.  Difficult to name every dish but I have to say it left a good impression and that I will be back with my family to retry some of the dishes again!"}
{"text":"I occasionally like to go to dim sum and I was excited to go to Dragon Boat because of the high rating.  I've tried twice to come here for lunch but it was so busy that I left.  Today the lineup was much shorter and I got a table within minutes.  Although we got a table, it took awhile to wave someone down to get a menu which we should have gotten when they sat us down.  The thing I don't like about dim sum is that most places usually serve the same items and there is nothing unique.  This time it was a bit different in that this was the first time I saw oxtail on a dim sum menu.  I would come back here just for that alone as it was quite good.  The traditional chicken feet was not very flavourful.  The ribs were very tasty and my wife's dumpling in soup was the biggest I have ever seen.   The next time I go I will have to order the duck.  It looked like a specialty as many were ordering.  I noticed it only because it was being served on some type of warmer with a candle or something warming the plate from underneath.  Everything was great till our last dish.  All our dishes came fast but the last dish never came.  About 20 minutes \"after we finished eating\", we inquired about our dish.  We inquired twice more but after 45 minutes of waiting, we asked for the bill.  Parking in this mall is almost impossible and you have to go to a parking lot next door. I'm not sure if we were allowed to park there as I saw about 5 cars with parking tickets."}
{"text":"Overall good quality Dim sum. Make sure you go before 11p.m., dishes get quite expensive if youre not getting the special price.  Make sure you try the milk tart! so yums!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good, despite there being more people frequenting the restaurant"}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum on a weekday for the morning deal. The dishes are $3 per item excluding their specialties. This is the discounted price. Although it costs a lot more than many other places, for the food, $3 per item I'd say is definitely worth it!  The food is very very good and the service is great! The teapot is fancy and has their own special design so you don't burn yourself when you pour your tea. It also comes with a little tea bag so you can refill the tea so it doesn't get bland.  We ordered a good array of food, since we had a lot of people (6 people). Their special bun dish is very good. It's essentially a pineapple bun with bbq pork inside. Sounds boring but tastes great! But overall, any food we ordered was done very well.  The downside is that I would not pay the full price to try this food. Although good, dim sum is greatly overpriced at the regular price. And parking is hard to find so if you really want to try this, go early!"}
{"text":"This was the first time i have had Dim Sum where I order all the food i want on a menu that has English and Chinese with some pictures and then give it to the waiters for them to bring it all out.   The only problem I had with this style is that it takes a long time for the food to come out making me even more hungry. Also when it comes out it comes out pretty fast making it hard to make room for the other food.  The food overall tasted fresh especially since it comes right out of the kitchen hot and steamy.   I am used to Dim Sum in Boston so this was a really nice experience.  I would recommend any tourist to come here even if you don't speak Chinese its a great brunch as long as you come in before 11 am because that's when things are cheaper."}
{"text":"First time here and really liked the food. Good deal on good dim sum before 11 am. Loved the egg custard bun. Definitely will go back. Took away one star for the service, and their ladies room, also host told us to not take too long at our table. But this is pretty usual at Asian places that are real busy. Really surprised how busy they were on a weekday!"}
{"text":"WORST experience attempting to order food. First they said we have to wait till 5pm for dinner service (we arrived at 4pm). Finally when we got there at 5pm, they said we didn't have reservations without letting us know when we had arrived at 4pm. Only after an argument lasting ten minutes did they FINALLY attempt to seat us. Beyond that, when we tried to order lobster and requested to see it, we were told to not worry since \"all the lobsters are the same\". After they eventually decided to let us see the lobster we were going to pay nearly $20/lb to eat, they became even more frustrated with us when we asked for a different larger one (even though bigger meant paying more). At this point we were so stressed out by an unnecessarily combative group of employees, we ended up leaving to find a different place. This was not our first time here, but it will definitely be our LAST time!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, but i's definitely not worth the wait!  I find the line disorganized and very chaotic.  They told me half an hour wait and it ended up being an hour and no apologies and noticed some people came after me with same number of parties and no reservations got seated first.. They might be regulars, but it still doesn't feel good as a paying customer who got treated like second class patrons... Good food, but wouldn't come back again!"}
{"text":"Very good dim sum for a reasonable price. If you order before 11:00 I believe dishes are $2.80. All the regular foods you would see at other dim sum restaurants. I especially liked the sweet mango dessert and the black chicken was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Good food great service.  Portion size is amazing and the flavours are rich and full.  Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Came in with my fiancee before 11AM.  Every Small, Medium, and Large item is $2.80.  The quality, portion, and presentation was impressive.  As a visitor from the SF Bay Area (thus not having many opportunities for dim sum in the Greater Toronto Area), I'd say that this is probably the best dim sum experience I've had in this area."}
{"text":"Dragon Boat has a fairly good taste of traditional Chinese Dim sum. Their renovation is great and up to level. They have a good overall services, except one of the server (who gives you table) named Ju**, of course I am not going to mention the full name, she has a terrible services. My sister went there on Saturday, October 29, 2016, she kindly asked this old lady how long is the wait roughly; this lady first said that my sister's attitude is not good. After my sister said that \" I did not being rude to you, I am just asking how long is wait with a normal tone. Then, this lady was really disrespectful and she upholded a terrible attitude to my sister and she shout at my sister who has 8 months pregnancy. This server then told her colleague that she will not give us seats next time. On the he second day, Sunday, October 30, 2016, we went there with reservation and this lady made us waited an hour and she told us that she is not professional for assigning seat for customer. Of course, she gave most of the table to her friend, well-know customer and who gave her red pocket money. Finally, the manager apologize to us and gave us a seat. Overall, her' service was awful. I'll still be Dragon Boat's customer because of their good food, but not the day with this evil old lady server/waitress."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum. Come before 11 am, you get a discount. Unfortunately, we missed the deadline. The dim sum was pretty good, however, it takes a long long tiem before the food comes out. By the time we had that one dish we came out and wait, we were hungry again.   Try to be wild and try some of the non traditional dim sum food... not bad.."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best dim sum place in gta (around $15 per person after tip and tax). The dinner is also very good. If you go in 4 or 6 and get the combo dinner, it comes out to about $20 per person.  The environment in general is clean, and food is authentic Cantonese and tasty (not much MSG), and service is not too bad."}
{"text":"I really like the Dim Sum. It's fresh because you order off a menu and they cook it per order. There are no push carts.   Novice Tip: Go early! Be in line by 8:30am! When the doors open run and sit your butt and claim your table! They DO NOT seat you! Almost got into a fight with another customer claiming my table! Ridiculous system. Good thing the food was good!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I tried it out and was pleasantly surprised that a tuck away restaurant was quite popular with the full parking lot.  The food was very good, traditional Chinese, and non-greasy.  We ordered a couple of seafood dishes, steamed fish, shrimp, scallops.  The seafood was fresh.  The suckling pig was roasted to a crisp.  The eggplant/ green beans stir fry was well done.  I would definitely come back again.  The manager was very nice.  I did however found one of the waiter to be annoying when he watched over my shoulder as I was paying and deciding on how much tip to give."}
{"text":"i'd say this is one of the top dim sum places in RH/Markham, and a very fine restaurant as well for dishes/everything else.  the ingredients they use are high quality. you can definitely taste a difference between this place and the cheaper chinese restaurants.   the bbq pork (or duck) with rice (i think after 11am) is soooo good - they bbq the pork themselves. and well worth the $7 or $8.  only down side is how busy/popular it is, which results in waiting for tables. and the parking situation kind of sucks (but not bad if you don't mind a little walk - i usually drop my grandparents at the door, then go find a parking space)"}
{"text":"My experience here was absolutely terrible, Came with two friends on a weekday night and the place was about half full. We came because we were craving peking duck and this restaurant was relatively close. We were seated and decided to order peking duck along with the crispy fried chicken and a dish of stirfry eggplant and beans. The guy taking our order told us they didn't have the chicken, which we were fine with so we opted for the spicy salt pork chops. He said he didn't recommend it along with half of the pork and chicken dishes on their menu. When we said we wanted to eat pork he told us to order the sweet and sour pork. After about half an hour.. we decided to order just the peking duck and eggplant dish. It was rather disappointing, I mean the dishes we wanted to order were pretty simple how is it that the restaurant was not capable of making these dishes decently to the point where your staff does not recommend it.. If If I wanted to order a sweet and sour pork dish I could very well go to a Chinese fast food resteraunt for a much cheaper price and probably better quality judging from the food we ate. The duck was decent which is how they earned the one star. The bill came to about $50-60 for those two dishes. I wasted my time and money never will I return to this restaurant. If the quality was there I would not mind but clearly even the employee doesn't think theres much quality. Service didn't make up for the lack of quality either, had to ask for water 3 times. Overall, strongly do not recommend."}
{"text":"3.5 stars on yelp? I thought it was more highly regarded though in my mind, it was always slightly better than average.  We came on a Tuesday at around 9:45 a.m. wanting to get the before 11:00 a.m. special pricing. I believe all dishes besides XL are charges at the small price which is 3.50.  Our first dish was this yellow ball desert pastry. I forget if there is durian in there. It was piping hot but overly sweet. B- The squid tentacles were good but did not come out piping hot the way I prefer it. B The hak gow was good with rich flavour and good texture but was overly salty. A- The siu ma was big but it was heavy and the texture was not great. B- to B There were these durian pastries too that I had days later which were okay but might have been better the day of. B- We had angus beef in egg noodles and it was okay, nothing special. B-  We recently had a terrible experience at Ginger & Onion and this was definitely much better than that, but everything was a B- 7/10 quality.  I get dragged to dim sum rather than voluntarily going, so I could go a year or two without it and would not think I am missing much. I would not wait in line to get in here. I would only come back if I could not find better, but I am sure there is better out there.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The wait for lunch today is way more than an hour.  The most upsetting part is we keep getting skipped.  There are people that comes in and does not have to wait because they know the maitre d. They think we don't notice it but we do.  They keep telling us is not our turn yet.   I would not come back to this place."}
{"text":"They screwed up our reservation which was booked for 12.30, but we waited till 2pm before a table was allocated. And they did not apologize."}
{"text":"Service is good, food is great but the service is below average. The place is always packed with people regardless if it was weekend or not. The food comes out fast so not much a wait time after you have been seated. But don't expect a warm welcome smile or attitude from the host."}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception here about 4 1/2 years ago. People still talk about the food and say it was the best wedding food they've ever had. The event manager was very helpful. The only reason it's minus 1 star is because the chair covers were kind of wrinkled on the day of the event. They don't iron that for you although the table linen is fine. I would recommend that future brides have a crew of helpers go in with a steaming device to steam the chair covers on the chair before reception guests arrive. However, overall, that doesn't affect how good the food is or your event pictures much because you can't see the chairs in up close group photos. Also you are focusing on having a good time with people you care about anyway."}
{"text":"I've been here for a few times and every time is fully packed.  Reservation system is not that effective as you still need to wait a long time after making reservation.   The food is very decent here, but service is so so."}
{"text":"Parking has to be very far away. Ordering food takes at least half hour. Very bad service. Rejecting customers when busy. Only people they r willing to serve are themselves. Never wanna go there any more!!!"}
{"text":"This is lately one of my favourite restaurant.  Not that I don't like this restaurant in the past but because it is so difficult to get a seat.  I mean literally has to wait for more than an hour, cut by half if you have a booking.  The line up is unbelievable given that there is not much parking space in the mall reserved for the restaurant with that size.  I always wonder where did those customers parked.  The dim sum is one of the best.  The order sheet marked with the must have but most of the time when we have a seat and order, they are all sold out.  Oh I forgot to mention that in order for us to have a table and don't have to wait for so long, we decide to go there for dim sum after 2:30 p.m.   You can't believe it, the restaurant is still full.  The BBQ dish, not on dim sum list, is one of my favourite.  You can see that most of the tables have it.  If I can have a reserved seat at lunch hour, I will always go there.  It is one of the top dim sum place in Toronto."}
{"text":"went here for dim sum around 1pm which is late because all the cheap pricing deals were to be found before 11am.  it was chinese new year week,  we chose it because it had dragon in the name of the restaurant,  it is after all  the year of the dragon. haha   a decent selection, good taste, friendly service, it's a solid dim sum choice in the area.  random fact,  location used to be an indian restaurant 10 years ago, then turned to an african resto. then now dragon boat fusion."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, and the stars are for the taste. Timing, however, I would give 2.5 stars. You're gonna have to wait for a seat if you don't know someone or have a reservation. The lunch menu is great (try the steamed egg yolk cream bun!), but dim sum can be slow.  So if you don't mind sitting a bit too get your food or waiting in line for a seat, this is a great place to try."}
{"text":"Located in a small plaza in Richmond Hill, the outside looks unassuming and small.  Inside, the restaurant fits at least 15 large tables. A few years ago, the restaurant renovated their decor (lots of gold accents), changed their plates and bamboo steaming baskets, and has a menu that is constantly evolving. The changes were beneficial in making the restaurant feel upscale to match their quality of food.  Some highlights were the:  Deep fried short ribs Huge har gow (shrimp dumplings) that came with a sweet shrimp in each basket Shrimp and beef steam rice rolls Deep fried taro with quail eggs.   Overall, the dishes came out hot and beautifully presented, with dumplings presented in square bamboo steamers.  The only disappointment during our visit was the egg custard bun. Before the renovations, Dragon Boat fusion used to make the best duck yolk custard buns that I have ever eaten, as the fillings were salty and sweet, and the egg custard would flow out of the bun when opened.  As for the service, I have had a hit and miss at each visit. We have had rude servers that had forgotten our requests frequently, and then we have had stellar service where our requests were taken care of immediately. At our most recent visit, we only waited about 15 minutes for our reserved table and had a wonderful server who was attentive."}
{"text":"Had to wait around 30 minutes for a table and when we were finally given one, we had to wait another 20 minutes to get the waiter's attention.  Food was decent though so it all had balanced out a little bit."}
{"text":"Food are very delicious and lots of variety. I feel that there is lots of different choice and dishes are well presented and creative!"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum in the morning. EXTREMELY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! THE WAITRESS ALMOST YELL AT ME, the food was AVERAGE nothing extraordinary! Not worth it for the long wait. There is other better dim sum place in Markham."}
{"text":"Well presented and great tasting. I had the hot and sour soup, 2 egg rolld, and a seafood basket made of fried noodles with shrimp, scallops, fish, asparagus,  snow peas, and a veggie I could not quite identify. All were great and made for quite a feast.....but not cheap. I will be back."}
{"text":"Very busy on weekends but one of the better places to get dim sum in Markham."}
{"text":"Dim sum was delicious, especially the durian pastry thats if you are into that sort of thing. It was filled with real durian and not some filler or cream. I've brought my family here for dinner but thought it wasnt really all that special. Everything was ok and not amazing; although I might come back for the pekking duck because it looked amazing. Definitely going back for dim sum before 11 am"}
{"text":"Some wild sea creatures in the tanks! A very pleasant, clean, and inexpensive dim sum experience.   Favourite items was the fried taro with quail egg and fried bbq pork dumpling. Little bit of a drive from downtown, but certainly worth it if you've got a table of 8 hungry friends."}
{"text":"My first impression was very good. We came on Jan 1st and the place was packed, but they found a small table for us right away. Positives:  - This restaurant is very good for companies and big families, have the round tables with a spinning disk, so it's nice to share the food  - they have a large, full wall fish tank  - The food and presentation is much better than in other Chinese restaurants we've been to  - the absolutely best shrimp wonton soup I've ever tried  This is what made the rating 3 stars instead of 4:  - Nobody checked on us after we were served. We tried to attract server's attention, as needed more tea and napkins, but no luck. This could be due to the fact they were really busy this evening.  - I ordered Stir-fried sliced duck with pineapple and ginger. The dish would be absolutely delicious if there was some duck meat. There was literally no meat, only fat and skin. It seemed they used left-overs from another duck dish. For the price of this meal I would expect more. The veggies were cooked to perfection I must say.  I would give it another try, but will be more careful with menu choices. I herd people are raving about dim-sum, but haven't tried yet."}
{"text":"Made reservations and still waited 45 minutes. Good size portions for the dumplings. We ordered way too much food and had a lot of left overs."}
{"text":"This is my fav Dim Sum place in the GTA. Even though it's a bit of a drive to get here, the Dim Sum is probably the best I've had outside of Asia.   Be prepared though; the waits are NOTORIOUSLY LONG. Don't arrive hungry because you will quickly turn hangry before the meal begins. For a party of two on an average (non-weekend) day you will probably wait 30mins but groups - be prepared to wait longer.   My personal favs are the rice noodles stuffed with different ingredients such as BBQ pork and deep fried pastry. I also love how everything is made to order instead of peddled on carts because all the food arrives hot and fresh.   The price per dish a bit more than the average dim-sum joint but the larger portions make it well worth the price difference."}
{"text":"Great place for dim sum! Be prepared to wait if you don't wake up early enough already. Also has deals for the early morning dim summers! Great for dinner as well! Try the winter melon soup! It needs to be ordered in advance but is worth it!"}
{"text":"One of the best if not BEST dimsum restaurant in Toronto/Markham/Richmond Hill. So many choices and classic dimsum dishes offered. It is consistently delicious every single time I have been here. They have an amazing deal if you can get a seat by 11AM on weekdays, but no worries as their food is well worth the price and wait. Service is attentive and friendly - they check on your tea often which is a huge plus (tea is exquisite-try their Chrysanthemum Puerh)! The lines move fairly quickly (expect 30-40min wait for 2 ppl at peak time) and efficiently with a numbering system.   Must try their ?? dimsum and the popular Cha Siu dish for lunchtime! Steamed, fried or baked, you can expect A+ food here!"}
{"text":"Their dim sum dishes are so gooooood. One of the best dimsum places for sure! But be aware of long wait time.. I went there around 2pm but still had to wait for 20 mins."}
{"text":"Oh.... they had the best BBQ pork....... Must order.  Good dim sum restaurant and will try their dinner next time in town again.  Their BBQ pork is a must...... Must order dish.  Price is very reasonable as well.  Love this place so much."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum place in the area. Arrive early if you want to be seated because it gets packed especially after 12 on the weekend. If you've never had Dim Sum bring a friend who has to help read the menu. Now and then you get a waitress who does not speak much english but usually someone else will come along to help out."}
{"text":"Very busy on a Sunday evening. Packed with mostly families. Noise level is high. Restaurant is nice and modern. Aquarium tanks near entrance add a nice touch with various seafood items. Entertaining but at the same time I feel bad for them. We ordered Peking duck, sweet and sour pork and chinese broccoli. Food was fresh and delicious and so, it deserved four stars. Service is typical Chinese restaurant style. Nothing extraordinary there. I would recommend for families or groups. Not date friendly."}
{"text":"Incredibly long wait for dim sum, especially if you're fighting the early dim sum special crowd. And we were here on a random Tuesday morning. Where do all the Asians in suburbia Toronto come from?! I can only imagine the animal house here during the weekends...  Parking situation is confusing. There was a (frozen) gentleman directing traffic at the front door and I had asked him where to park given that pretty much all but 5 spots in the strip mall are reserved for patrons of neighboring businesses and he directed me to a lot behind the actual strip mall. I had no idea what that meant as the place was pretty much encircled by parking lots, so I (probably illegally) parked in a lot down the slope.   Dim sum was good. There were a lot of creative items on the menu that I've never seen/heard of. And some fancy fusiony items including foie gras, which we did not order because we were too full. A lot of the names sound more appealing than it actually tastes, but highlights include the durian puff, the sweet top char siu bao, and the almond shrimp ball. The hargow were humungous and adorned with a pretty headed shrimp, but the skin was pretty thick. Shrimps had a great texture but smelled a little more fishy than I'd like.   I'd be happy to come back for dim sum if in the area, but wouldn't necessarily make it a point to come here. The long wait is a pretty significant deterrent too."}
{"text":"Really I want to give 2.5 stars only. I have been to this restaurant a few times, only because it's always booked and busy (from dim sum to dinner time). I went again recently and I don't think I will be back. Service was bad and food has become mediocre. We ordered \"staple Chinese restaurant\" dishes which included a 3 lbs lobster (green onion/ginger stir fry). The lobster tasted fishy as there was not enough ginger and for what they did put, it wasn't fresh ginger. The worst part was the LOUD Chinese patrons right next to our table. They had no manners and were hammered! The restaurant staff did nothing to make other patrons feel at ease. They brought their own booze and probably more then they could handle. I thought I was sitting next to a frigging MANDARIN BOOM BOX. Yup ... the clientele has definitely changed. If you've looking for good food and decent atmosphere, don't go there."}
{"text":"Hands down, by far the best dim sum we have had in a long time!  This place has the most unique dim sum dishes along with the traditional ones that you will find everywhere else.  We had some very tasty chicken pot pies, beef tendon, roast pork buns, cuttle fish dish as well as some other savory dishes.  They even had a very delish pumpkin congee that we enjoyed quickly in the chilly weather.  We were lucky that we have friends who are locals who suggested making reservations on a Sat morning/afternoon: 11:30.  The place was packed and the line was out the door.  We could see why after tasting several of the dim sum dishes. The prices are absolutely reasonable, presentation is immaculate--we will eat here every time we visit the GTA for sure.  We are looking forward to trying their dinner banquet meal some time as well."}
{"text":"First things first - find a parking spot.  There are only 4 or 5 spots in front of the restaurant. The rest are reserved for adjoining businesses.  Even if you go around to the back, only a few unreserved spots are available.  Best to park in the adjacent parking area, and just walk over.  Next thing is getting a table.  People actually line up before it opens at 9 am. By 9:30 am the place is full.  People in the first round start finishing and leaving by 10:15 am, so if you are in line, you still have a chance to get in before regular prices take effect at 11 am.   Before 11 am, their flat rate is $3.50 for S, M, L.  There are some exceptions, and those are designated by a star on the menu, or one of their \"must eat\" dishes.  Tea is $1.50 per person.   Food is very good. Siumai is chock full of fresh shrimp, the pork seems to be hand minced, not ground by machine.  The #1 bun under the sun \"baked bbq bun\" has just the right amount of savoury filling to semi sweet crust ratio.  The fried seaweed roll is crunchy and not too oily.  The steamed rice roll is packed full of bbq pork, although it would taste a lot better if it has a little bit less salt. Overall, while it is priced higher than many other dim sum places around, it is still worth the premium."}
{"text":"The wait times are too long. It's incredibly disorganized. If you don't speak Cantonese or mandarin don't even consider going to this place. My family and I waited for over 45 minutes. We sat there and watched parties of the same size (4) come in after us and get seated before us. After 45 minutes of this we decided to leave. We won't venture back to this place."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice for dinner only. My first experience (last year) wasn't the best. We had reserved a wintermelon soup a week before and on the day of, the manager told us that they had sold it to another customer. We were extremely disappointed. The food that night was fine, but because of that incident, the restaurant didn't leave us with the best impression.   Last week we came back for another try. We reserved a king crab and a black sea bass. Thankfully this time they didn't give the seafood to someone else, but we requested for a crab of at least 10 pounds. The heaviest one they had was 8 pounds. Also, the quality of the ingredients used to cook the crab and fish weren't the best. The quality of the glass noodles used on the bottom of the crab was terrible - very shredded and not chewy at all. Paying around $50 per pound of crab, I would expect higher quality. We also ordered some Chinese veggies and requested them to be cooked using shrimp sauce. When it came, it was cooked with Chinese cheese sauce and the veggies were very tough and \"old\".   The another problem here is parking. Majority of the parking in the parking lot is reserved for other businesses so it is super hard to find a spot for dim sum and dinner. I recommend parking at the Keg and walking over."}
{"text":"I have gone here multiple times, and this is probably my favourite dim sum place in Toronto GTA - as in I haven't found one better (granted I haven't gone to ALL dim sum places). The only annoying thing is lines - extremely long. I usually try to beat the rush and arrive when it opens or right after it opens. The food is really really really good. Light, not too heavy not too oily or greasy, and each dim sum dish actually tastes different. I've ordered a large variety of dim sum here and I haven't disliked anything I ordered. Their chestnut and corn congee, the different chang fen, the cha shao bao, and shrimp dumplings, the tripe, it's all so good.   I wouldn't wait 45 minutes for this place, but it's definitely my go to when I'm really craving dim sum."}
{"text":"FOOD Food is delicious and fresh. Distinct dishes where you can't have it anywhere else. It's insanely packed during the weekend where people would line up way before the restaurant even opens!  PARKING Parking here is deadly and the worst place to eat due to this! There's many reserved parking where you just can't park. Last time I went they had a parking coordinator to guide you to an open spot, which does help a little and helps with incoming traffic.   SERVICE The servers seems to be pretty dressy. One time, I wasn't really dressed well and felt like wearing my comfort clothes and did not receive great service. They will ignore you and feels like I didn't even exist. They will be happy to service you when you pay for the bill."}
{"text":"A lot of my friends love this dim sum location but I didn't find it to be that amazing. Dim sum dishes were alright, nothing insanely good. If you can, try to go and order before 11AM as dim sum dishes are all at the same price (I think $2.80-$2.90) regardless of their size! The tea on the other hand was amazing, they even give you a little tea packet of your choice.   Parking was a nightmare. There are few parking spaces available for such a popular dim sum restaurant. Don't park in the parking lot across from the plaza! Apparently you get fined/ticketed if you do. I'm not sure if there's any truth to that but better safe than sorry!  Overall it's not my go-to dim sum restaurant (especially not on weekends as they get quite busy and there aren't that many tables)  but it's a good option if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I came here around 1pm yesterday for dim sim and it was pretty crowded; I waited for about 20 minites before I got a table for 2. Putting into consideration that their prices are a bit higher than most regular dim sum places, their dumplings are larger. I overall enjoyed dim sum here, however there was 1 dish that I found was not up to par to the others. It was the steamed mushroom and veggie dumplings; the dumpling was filled mostly with veggies and had tiny bits of mushroom here and there. The taste of the snow pea leaves in the dumplings was strong so mushroom could not even be tasted. The only reason I ordered that was because it said mushroom (I love mushroom) so it was quite disappointing. However, I would definitely return to eat dim sum here again."}
{"text":"The food is great, service is good, but you need to be patient if you come on weekends, even made reservations you still need wait for a table."}
{"text":"Excellent food quality in a very oriental/fusion funky restaurant. Great staff and service."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  This place has a ridiculous amount of people lining up even at 2pm. I was in shocked as I walked in pretty late for a late dimsum \"brunch\". Parking was so small and inconvenient as most spots had reserved signs. Many people just park at the other parking lot across the plaza that has no association (technically that is not allowed and may risk getting towed FYI). Prior to this visit, I have only been here once and recalled slim memory of it.   Food was pretty decent for its price. Had 5 dimsum dishes and also a BBQ pork dish with rice. The bill came up to $38 and change after tax and tips for 2 people which is not bad at all and we still had leftovers to bring home. I noticed that a lot of people order from their lunch special menu aside from dimsum. Seems to be a very popular place for other items compared to other dimsum restaurants.   Overall, even though it was insanely busy, I had a pleasant experience. I would be back but I don't think it is worth a long wait. I would suggest to just come with small group or best is 2 people because it is a much faster wait."}
{"text":"So apparently this is a really famous dim sum restaurant in Richmond Hill, but since it's not in my area, I've never tried it until now.  It's hidden away in a cluster of strip malls filled with good Chinese businesses like the famous HK milk tea place Marathon and Destiny's on the other side of the parking lot; you have to keep your eyes peeled if you're looking for this place. I came for the morning dim sum, and there's always a lineup of people, which is promising in that the food should be good, but disappointing in standing around at the crowded waiting area up front.  We were seated 45 minutes later in a thankfully comfortable section of the restaurant.  Impressive was the creative types of dim sum available, including the bird's nest taro, and the har gow.  Not one dish disappointed, and the prices are reasonable for the type of quality that you get here.  This is not your standard cheapo dim sum folks, so expect to pay for quality.  If I'm in Richmond Hill and I had some friends to kill time with while waiting in line, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I grew up in New York and spent some time in Chicago where there are a plethora of dim sum restaurants and never in my life have I seen people line up for dimsum before. There were hordes of people in front of the restaurant by 9AM (when they open), and when the doors finally opened, people were running inside to grab seats.   The dim sum here is above average, but I am not sure I would wait in line again unless I was bringing visitors here for the first time. Unlike other dimsum places I've been to, the presentation of each dish is very nice.  My favorite was definitely the shumai. The ha gao (shrimp dumplings) is also pretty good. Definitely go once to check out what the hype is about."}
{"text":"During my time in Toronto, I remember we stop by at this dim sum. I was thinking to myself what is so special about this dim sum restaurant. I have been to plenty in New York City.   This place totally separates itself from a lot of dim sum restaurants. First, there are no carts, all dim sum dishes are made to order. Everything comes out fresh. Second, the portion size of dishes are much bigger than normal ones. Third and most important it taste pretty darn good.   Dim sum dishes come out really quick and depending on how much you order, it can just come out like a marching band parade.   There are also a lot of unique dim sum dishes that I have never seen elsewhere. My favorite dishes that I enjoyed the most were the cheong fun, baos, and the har gow.   Definitely a recommended dim sum restaurant."}
{"text":"Always experience full house and excellent service in this restaurant.   Oysters with Veggies (score 5/5) This dish seems like a fusion dish. I could taste the Worcester sauce or red wine vinegar in the sauce. The oysters are big and they blend well with the veggies on the side. This dish serves like a salad before the main course.  Sweet and Sour Pork (score 5/5) This dish is my all time favourite. The pork are deep fried and coated with sweet and sour sauce. The pork are crispy and the taste of the sauce, the soul of this dish, is excellent. It not just the pork in this dish is delicious but also each of the side ingredients are tasty as well, blueberries, mango chunks, red and green peppers and the thin crispy chips.   Peking Duck (score 4/5) This is a 2-course dish. The first one is to wrap the crispy Peking Duck skins with bread slices which one could also put veggies, fruits or even marshmallows inside the wrap. I prefer the traditional style of putting only a slice of crispy duck skin, some green onions, some cucumbers in the wrap and then dip it in the hoisin sauce.  The second one is another wrap but this time is a lettuce wrap. In a similar way, I put the Peking duck meat chunks which are fried with some celery chunks and deep fried rice noodles in the lettuce wrap and then dip it in the hoisin sauce to eat. The meat are well seasoned and tastes good. The only negative comment I have is the dish seems has shrunk in size compared to before.  Pot of Fish: (score 3.5/5) The fish does taste good but a lot of bones and seems quite watery. When the waiter saw that, he's kind enough to cancel the order for us even though we have already eaten quite a bit already.  Red Bean Soup: (score 4/5) There are many a lot red beans and the beans are big. I could even taste the orange peel in the soup, which is very GOOD! The only thing is it is a bit too sweet too sweet to my taste.   Cookies and Papaya Dessert (score: 5/5) Tastes Good and unique!!"}
{"text":"I can't decide how I feel about this place. Kind of over rated. Not bad by any means. Perhaps we just way over ordered and got real tired of it quickly. Definitely worth a try at least once. I personally think the food is very good...better than Boston even. I guess I had the idea that this place would blow me away. It didn't but that doesn't mean the food isn't good.  Service is slow. Decor is beautiful! Wifi password is their phone number. Order by checking off what you want from their large paper menu. Some items not available till after 11am. Hard to find parking that is not reserved for other stores. I heard they have special prices where most dim sum is less than $3 each...but beware...what if its yesterday's leftovers? I dunno but just wondering out loud."}
{"text":"Dragon Boat Fusion is in the plaza across from all the good stuff at East Beaver Creek - there's barely anything else in this plaza and yet there is never any parking.  This is because this place is always busy no matter when you come.  Regardless of whether you've made a reservation, I find that more often than not you have to wait about an hour.  Unfortunately, the waiting area is not meant to handle the sheer amount of customers, so you will end up standing shoulder-to-shoulder with other people for a good amount of time.  Some of the tables are pretty squished together, but if you are lucky and get a decently spaced table, a good time awaits you.  There are quite a lot of choices for dim sum here and I find it's great for both dim sum regulars (looking for more traditional dim sum) and dim sum novices (trying dim sum for the first time).  Staff are quite friendly - even if you come as a whole table of youngsters, they are still pretty friendly and courteous.    Their egg yolk steam bun is a must-try dessert!"}
{"text":"First time i went there were no surprises and i got what i expected and paid a premium for eating great cantonese style seafood. Crab, Shrimp, Eel all were prepared to what i expected would be if i were in any restaurant in HK.  So it was a huge mistake to plan an event here. I reserved a table a week in advance an ordered suckling pig, winter melon soup, and peking duck. I arrive to find my table taken, and that only the winter melon was available as they sold out of all the other items i reserved. The xiao bao which i paid $30 are traditionally white but came in a puke yellow color and tasted like detergent.  I was serviced by multiple waiters none of which took responsibility to see my order through. Never Again."}
{"text":"My family and I were in Toronto for a little get-away over New Years, and normally we go to the Ginger and Onion (next to the Pacific Mall) for Dim Sum (which is just ok), but thought we would try someplace new. Looked on Yelp, and this place was not only the closest to our hotel, but seemed to be rated #1.  The details say it opens at 9:00 AM, and we were there are 9:07- in the seven minutes prior to our arrival- they were packed!  We ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table, and just so you know, we had ticket #1, and while we were waiting the 45 minutes, they got up to ticket #66!  Was it worth the wait-absolutely!  My wife, who is from China, said it was some of the best she has ever eaten in North America, and some restaurants in China.  All of the dishes were well seasoned and flavorful. The steamed shrimp dumplings were pretty large, and the fried shrimp dumplings were absolutely amazing. The only item I thought was just \"ok\", were the roast pork buns, but other than that, excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for my dads birthday. This is THE place to have an old Asian persons birthday lol. Almost every other table was celebrating a birthday. It's nice because the staff sings to you in Chinese while they bring out a cake (if you bring one in).  The food was good. Must have seafood it is a seafood restauarant. We opted for the king crab since it was a special occasion. We had 7 people so we tried to ask for their smallest crab. The one they brought out was 10 lbs. pretty big... Not sure if they lied to us to up sell us. We ended up going for it. Pretty nice that they let us take photos with it. We had the crab sitting in the middle of the table for around 10 minutes lol. The price in comparison to other restauarants is good it's at around 32.5$ per pound. So our crab was 328$ in total. They cook it in 3 different ways! The legs are steamed in onion and it's super delicious. Then they make a fried rice with the crab- not as good, a bit bland and not much crab in it.. The only cool thing is it is served in the shell of the crab.  And lastly they fry it.. It was a bit too deep fried for me but my husband loved it's flavour.  We also ordered other dishes too, see the pics, they were good too.. Heard they are the most popular there."}
{"text":"For my Toronto trip, I visited total four dim sum restaurants; Dragon Boat, Lai Wah Henn, Casa-Imperia, and Crown Princess? Dragon Boat is a well-known popular dim sum place and even people made a video about it on YouTube. We went before 9 am but there were some people waiting inside of their cars. Around 9 am sharp, there were about more than 20 people waiting in the line already.  Comparing to most of restaurants in PA, US., Dragon boat's shrimp dumpling was big but that's it. I am not sure if it is the quality of shrimp or shrimp didn't season well, you can't taste \"shrimp-flavor\" and dumpling skin is too thick. This also happened to pork dumpling with lack of flavor. BBQ pork puff pastry has multiple thin layers and fluffy but amount of pork is so few and so little that you have to fight so hard to find it. Radish cake has mild bitter taste and watery.  They didn't address chicken pasty contains curry on the menu that we don't like so we didn't finish all our orders and left the restaurant with huge disappointments. Perhaps the popularity is because all dim sum costs less than $4 if you pay cash before 11am."}
{"text":"One of the places to go for dim sum when in Toronto, Canada. Stop by here on your way to Markham since it is close by. My friends and I thought this place served dim sum all day but good thing we called to ask cause they dont! They stop serving dim sum at 3:30pm so we made a reservation for next morning. The lady did advise us altho we can make a reservation you still might need to wait a while. Regardless, we still made a reservation and we did wait for about 10 mins. The place is easily packed so remember to get a number when you get to the restaurant. The food were overall good, much better than New York. The size of their Dim sum were huge! Like their siu mai and har gow. Its twice as big as ny ones. They have unique dim sum dishes like the steamed seafood & pork dumpling w/ lotus roots. Its an interesting combo of dumpling wrapped in seaweed with lotus roots. Their pork bun is a mix of pineapple bun with pork inside. That was probably my favorite. Another favorite was the deep fried durian pastry puff. It is very flaky and be cautious when picking it up cause it easily snaps in half. The durian flavor is strong and the pastry is flaky which i like. If you're a durian fan, definitely get it. The fish shaped mango pudding was my least favorite. Altho it looks cool but not much mango flavor and its just jello texture.  There were other dim sums we didnt get to try since we had a plane to catch and we were stuffed. Will be back next time when in Toronto to try more dim sums!"}
{"text":"What's with the wait? We came here on a weekday and thankfully we called to reserve our tables. We found out that there is a discount if you place the order before 11am. I don't think this place is packed because of the discount. It is the food. We didn't order ALL dishes on the menu sheet but we ordered a lot. Every dish had its only little thing that made it extra special. The shrimp Dumpling had a shrimp in it. The rice noodles with fried dough had doshi flakes, Rice noodle (cheung fun) with shrimp had a thin piece of vegetable between the shrimp and the rice noodles. Everything looked great and it tasted better than it looked.  This place makes me want to move to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Closer to 3.75 stars...  Came here on a weekday for dimsum.  Parking was free provided that you give the restaurant your license plate #. We got here at 10 and there was already a line. I can't imagine what it would be like on the weekend. We (group of 2) waited about 20-30 minutes to get a table. Service was pretty mediocre, no better or worse than other busy dimsum restaurants. Portions were generous, presentation was nice and ingredients tasted fresh.  Here's what we ordered: Deep fried taro dumpling with quail egg: I get this every time I go for dimsum. These ones were about twice the size of your typical taro dumpling though! Taste-wise, I have had better. These were good, but somewhat lacking in flavour. It could use some more mushrooms and onion. I think I prefer a smaller, bite-sized dumpling with more flavour.   Baked BBQ pork buns: I have never had these before. They were good but I would like it better if it were more moist.  Shrimp dumpling: These were huge! Shrimp were very fresh and juicy.  Beef tendon: Best I have had. Great texture and so flavourful.  Steamed pork ribs: Very fresh tasting but could be a bit more tender. I also prefer this dish with a little more chili (but it's okay, I just asked for chili oil).  Deep fried durian pastry- Very unique taste. Nice and creamy and not too smelly. Not sure if I would pay 5.60 again for this though.  Milk tarts- Delicious, but we were expecting this to come out hot and fresh. It was a bit lukewarm.  Overall, this is one of the better dimsum places we've been to. Would need to come back a few times to figure out what our favourites are. The two of us spent about $40 and had lots of leftovers to take home, enough to easily feed another person. That said, if it was regular price, I'm not sure it would be worth paying the extra money... or more importantly, enduring what I am sure would be an even longer wait at lunch hour/ on weekends.  But if I am ever free again on a weekday... YES I will be coming back."}
{"text":"My favourite Dim Sum place. Fresh, reasonable and quality ingredients. This place is a cut above from the many dim sum spots out there. The only downside can be the waiting times. It is extremely busy and you could potentially wait an hour for a table."}
{"text":"I came here after a recommendation from a friend. We were told it gets very busy so we called in and made a reservation an hour in advance. When we got here, we found out that they didn't even put in our reservation and told us we would have to wait for an hour. The service is terrible and definitely not worth it no matter if the food is good.."}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum. Nice decor and great presentation.   Abundant parking too. I highly recommend this place   They are very generous with the sauces and dips when the dishes come, a big plus for a guy that likes dipping like me.   I'm giving this place 5 stars. But please beware it's crazy busy here."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday dinner. The food was good, with a good variety of choices. The crab was very delicious. We had fish, seafood fried rice, roast duck, Cantonese noodles and chicken and cream corn soup, and weren't disappointed. The fish came very late though, and we had to remind them that we weren't done yet. They let us serve the cake we brought. Overall a nice restaurant that we will go back to and try other things on the menu. It was expensive but not as high as we originally feared. The a la carte menu is not on their website, which is a problem because you only see the set menus."}
{"text":"All the prices are good for the quality and quantity given. The food is made with fresh ingredients and tastes amazing. The only problem is the line up which can take over half an hour."}
{"text":"Excellent place for dimsum. They offer alot of specialty dim sum dishes amongst the traditional ones. The food is delicious. The service here is really good as well - they're really quick with refilling the teapots."}
{"text":"I come here with my family for Dim sum.  There is always a long wait for this place.  The dim sum is pretty good but on the pricey side.  They have a okay variety of dim sum but nothing that really stands out to me except for their Egg Yolk Bun. Their Chau Siu rice is amazing here thou.  I hate the parking lot of this place as 80% of the spots are resevered for the store owners and you have to park so damn far."}
{"text":"Dim Sum and service are good once you pass the front area lady. Our new favourite dim sum restaurant. They offer big discount for dim sum prior to 11am on the weekends. They are packed. Make sure you take cash for this. Their regular price is not bad though."}
{"text":"TL;DR very very very yummy dim sum, but extremely long wait times (~1 hour).  Really really good dim sum. Definitely one of the best places around this area. The food is delicious, gets to your tables in a reasonable timeframe, and service is good too. There's a good selection of the classic dishes, all of which are quite yummy. For example, the siu mai is very juicy and tasty, though they one of the biggest I've ever seen.  Unfortunately, with great food comes great popularity. And with great popularity comes long wait times. It is insaneley packed here during lunch hours. Expect to wait at least an hour if you want to be seated here. Parking around this restaurant can also be quite troublesome, since the spots close to the restaurant is reserved parking."}
{"text":"More expensive than your typical Dimsum. but the quality trade-off is worth it. Ordered the pumpkin ramen, shrimp dumplings, white chicken feet, durian pastries, chicken tarts. So scrumptious, especially the durian pastry. Because we waited a little longer than expected for our glass of water, server came back with bottles cold water instead. Would come back."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I last visited the restaurant, for dim sum or dinner. We had relatives back in town so we came here for a 10-person set dinner meal with all the works: shark fin soup, sea cucumber, lobster, fish, shrimp and scallops, chicken...there was plenty of food for the 9 of us that showed up from the original intended 13. What we didn't account for was some recent changes in diet - seafood was off the list for some after due to food intolerance/allergies, which meant a tough meal to finish.  The key highlights of the meal were the shark fin soup, the sea cucumber, and the lobster. Unfortunately, none of those were very good. The shark fin soup was tasteless, it didn't even taste like the chicken soup base that it was supposed to be. It tasted watery with shredded chicken and unknown plastic threads interspersed. The sea cucumber was average - nothing notable about the taste or the texture. It was classically prepared with greens on the side and oyster sauce, so nothing special really. The lobster looked promising and boasted a full four pounds comprised of two lobsters. It wasn't particularly fresh and the garlic sauce wasn't garlicky - it was oily and bland for the most part. I was looking forward to the lobster since it only shows up on special occasions now that so much of my family can't have seafood, but I was disappointed by the stiff meat and tastelessness.  The fish was well prepared and had good texture, which helped redeem the meal.  There was simply too much food, so we packed away the chicken, fried rice, and noodles, and moved straight to dessert.  Dessert was a multi-bean dessert soup \"??\", mango pudding, and almond cookies. The dessert soup was quite good and a huge highlight for me as its one of my favourites and rarely served at restaurants. As promised there was tons of beans, and it was a good amount of sweetness. There was no coconut milk or taro added in, meaning it wasn't too sweet or too thick even as it cooled down. The mango pudding was orange-coloured tasteless jelly - don't eat it. The almond cookies were alright, but I opted for seconds of dessert soup over my share of cookie.  The overall verdict was that there's been improvement in their dinner meals here at Dragon Boat, but it is still rather average. Considering the price one may even consider it sub-par.  A positive note was the server we had. Servers here are dedicated to a few tables and it makes for a much more organized experience. Our server was positive and excellent at her job - she attended to our needs quickly and portioned food neatly and evenly. I've had experienced where the servers dripped soup and sauces all over the table as they divided out each dish - but this time there wasn't a drop on the table! Chinese restaurants usually mean understaffed situations with lots of hollering and hand waving, but this wasn't needed at all this time. Unfortunately we found out that our server is a part timer at the location - fingers crossed we see her again next time."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in Richmond hill but be prepared to wait in line on both weekdays and weekends. Their har gao is one of my favourites and the vegetable dumplings are fantastic as well.  Funny thing to note here is that if you ask for cold water, the servers will look at you like you're crazy and then eventually bring out bottled water. Bottled water is free and I've had this several times. Don't forget though - the tea costs you!"}
{"text":"The food was OK but not quite the typical dim sum I had in mind when coming here. I'm not well versed in the different dim sum styles, but I'd definitely say this is more Cantonese style.  There was just way too much sugar in everything and there's absolutely no sauces on the table or otherwise to cut through the grease and sugar. Where was the soy, the vinegar and most important to me, where was the chilli oil?    I ordered congee with thousand year egg and somehow got a congee with clams and very little egg. Usually, I love clams, but it's quite off-putting in congee. The pork buns were a bit sweet for me but are great if you want the sweet pork buns you find in bakeries. We also ordered the baby octopus with curry, but I was a bit disappointed.  Now, I've tasted unique curry sauces on the sweeter side, but I don't have much explanation why this curry did not sit well with me.  Perhaps the octopus itself wasn't fresh and sugar tends to extenuate it?  On the positive side, the servings are large and the price is fairly cheap. The wait time was actually decent for the amount of customers.  Also, the non-cart concept works well; just be careful of over-ordering!  The chicken feet were pretty good and as expected.  The service was decent and parking went well with a guy out in the lot coordinating."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday afternoon all my exams and it feels great.  After church, I decided to go dimsum with my family at Dragon Boat Fusion Cuisine.  The dimsum were really fresh, hot, and tasty.  It was not as loud as I thought it would be as most people has not come for the early dimsum.  Typically, we like to have dimsum during lunch time for friends and family gathering.  As we were approaching 10am, a lot more people showed up and you are in for a wait for at least 15-20 minutes.  Ensure you carpool if possible since there is always insufficient parking.  The staffs were all really friendly and quick to respond to our requests.  The decor include elegant wall murals and crystal chantelliers.    I particularly liked the grass jelly dessert with cashew.  It might not be for everyone, but I loved the bitter herbal taste of the dessert.    All in all, a pretty good sunday breakfast experience fore me."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0  Was just alright. Not worth the long line up I must say. The skin on both the Chiu Chow dumpling and rice rolls were way too thick. The chicken feet was very large and flavourful. Everything else was just average."}
{"text":"People line up at 8am (I believe) to get a table for 9am.  Nuts.  We showed up just before 9am, got into the crazy line, and just managed to snag a table as the floodgates were opened.  Can you say free for all?  We waited about 45 minutes to get food, and left at around 11am.  There were still about 30 people waiting for a table.  What a morning!    Weekday special before 11am, all S, M, and L (not otherwise noted) are the price of a small.  That's a great deal!  I've been here on the weekend and the line is just as intense for the regular priced menu.    There wasn't a dish I didn't like.  I particularly enjoyed the shrimp ball with almonds.  Come with a group, order lots of dishes, and you will understand why it's so popular.    I really wish the entry procedure was more civilized.  But if you want authentic, nothing more authentic than rushing in and grabbing a table as if your life depended on it!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is try the BBQ pork...rice, noodle... I do believe this is T.O's best BBQ pork...it's so flavorful and so tasty.  I mainly order this when we crave for some dim sum.  I took the whole family there for my daughters 100 days for dinner and well the food did not disappoint.  Dish after dish the food was great tasting and not so greasy and to end it off the tiny cookies was a great way to finish off the meal.  Remember to order the BBQ PORK!"}
{"text":"Dim sum is great! If you order before 11am and pay by cash, you get discount!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Absolutely my favorite DimSum place, by far, these days, and I've tried most of the well recommended places in Markham and Richmond Hill. Almost everything was not just good, but great, from the beef 'cheong fun' rice noodle rolls to legit spring rolls, and Dragon Boat truly has THE BEST har gow, sui mai, and ham sui gok I've ever had, period!  A++ Weekday mornings from 9am - 11am you can enjoy all their small-medium-large dimsum for just $2.99 per dish, but its cash or c.c. only, no debit for the specials.  Service was excellent, teapot was filled quickly upon the customary tipping of the teapot lid, and all the dishes were delivered quickly and very hot from the kitchen. Yes, parking is a bit of a pain, with only a handful of spots out front, so you'll be walking over from the parking lot next door, and lineups are a regular feature if you show up after 10 a.m., but the food truly makes these minor quibbles seem unimportant. I am freshly surprised all over again every time I visit here, how they make ham sui gok, har gow and siu mai, so richly flavourful. They take the dim sum staples you've tried many times before, but somehow manage to turn the flavour up to \"11\", while featuring a very delicate wrapper that never falls apart or sticks horribly to its neighbor - absolutely succulent and delicious! My advice: be prepared for the parking and weekend line-ups, or go by 10am on weekdays, either way, you will thank me later. :)"}
{"text":"WOW! that about sums up my disappointment. Never, have I ever felt like more of an outsider as a white girl. My boyfriend and I stood there like idiots waiting for someone to acknowledge us. Not only did other people get escorted before us and moved around us - we literally were stared at like we were the animals in the zoo! I thought perhaps it was a private party and we just walked in, so when I asked the guy said \"no\" and walked away ... know we weren't the first Caucasian couple to walk in there - I was so excited and now hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"this place is indeed a nice place to have early tea!! Food is good and fresh... and they come out this time cute square bamboo box instead of the old fashion round one... kinda cool and unique... their food is good, not OMG WOW, but it's good... the restaurant is very fancy looking, but i kinda expected that... but the sad part is... there is no parking... we went there at 9am and there is no parking!!! we have to park behind somewhere... and walk up... ALSO... if you came in for lunch... expect to wait for a long time... good that we come when they open so we dont' have to wait for a table, but then by the time we leave (like 10ish...) people are waiting outside already!!! so come prepared!!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM. This place was delicious and exceeded all expectations. Our group of 5 came here on a Saturday around 11:30 and waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  We ordered entirely too much, including har gow, siu mai, honey beef ribs, crueller with rice noodle wrapped around the outside, baked char siu bao, char siu puff pastry, chicken feet, char siu with rice noodle wrapped around the outside, pumpkin and spinach steamed dumplings, congee, veggies, dumplings with peanuts inside, durian pastry, seafood pancake and pork spare ribs.  A couple of stand out items were the honey beef ribs, and the char siu with rice noodle wrapper. I typically don't like the beef ribs as they are either too tough or fatty - these were neither! The char siu with rice noodle wrapper was packed full of meat when I am only used to seeing a few dinky pieces.     Once seated the service was quick and efficient.  The plates were promptly cleared, which is a good thing since we did not have enough room on our table.  The price for the 5 of us was around C$86, but we probably could have easily been full at around C$65-70.  Sometimes our eyes are just bigger than our stomachs!"}
{"text":"I always complain about how parking is a nuisance in Asian malls but this place takes that shit to a new level. Every spots outside the restaurant is reserved or taken so everyone is forced to park near the back. Obviously you can kiss that door goodbye on a weekend because you will be parking somewhere far like Destiny's lols. This restaurant is not exactly cheap and that's because their dishes are actually good. Let me clarify, most dim sum places are okay but Dragon Boat consistently pumps out high quality dishes. You will know because they don't cheap out on the meat portions and food tastes fresh. I did forget to mention that they are ridiculously busy on weekends EVEN if you make a reservation (e.g. wait another 30 minutes on a Saturday after 12pm). I went again with my family on a weekday and the place is still quite full though waiting is not required. Dishes are at a set price when you order before 11am and I think it's slightly less than $3 each (regardless of size).  By the way dim sum dishes are usually categorized by their sizes (S, M, L, XL) and obviously the prices match their portions. Some people also like to order entrees because they don't cost that much $6-12 (?) and are suitable for large groups. I would recommend that everyone visit the main website to look at their food pictures. I was definitely impressed because most Chinese restaurants do not even have a regular working website lols. Please note that the service kind of sucks here, so this means you aren't going to get smiles from everyone who serves you."}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good to be honest. Also, the service is stellar. If you want to get a table during the cheap hours, be sure to be there at 9a.m. or you might have to wait awhile. Or... Just go during a weekday.   Their shrimp dumplings are full of shrimp and they even give you a shrimp as well! Nice bonus! Also, I love their durian pastry (even though everyone around me wants to die when I have it)  Great place!"}
{"text":"Taste good and quality food. Parking is insane and restricted. Long waits for seating and price is average.   I'd eat here again but not often. Give the wait times."}
{"text":"My friends brought me to this dim sum place on a Sunday morning. We waited for about an hour for a table. There isn't much seating in the waiting area, no seating outside either.   My friends did all the ordering, but I can comment on my favorites. I really enjoyed the savory turnip cake, they weren't greasy. The other thing I enjoyed was these shrimp rolls with fish flakes on top. Peanut and oyster sauce were offered on the side for dipping. I don't think I've seen that at other dim sum places, but I thought the pairing went nicely together. The fish congee was good too, good amount of fish pieces inside.   Service was a bit lacking, but I sympathize since the place is packed to the brim the entire time. I think the staff did the best they can.  Plenty of parking spots available in this plaza. I'd come and eat here again."}
{"text":"One of the better dim sum places in Richmond Hill. The overall quality is generally pretty good.  Its almost always busy on the weekends around lunch hour. Its not the cheapest dim sum place either.  Dinner is pretty standard Chinese restaurant food. Just decent quality.  Come here for Dim Sum."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting and prepared food, large portions, with unique wooden square boxes to serve dim sum. The volumes are more than what you expect, especially at this price which is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great was dimsum, first impression..awesome food,  service was excellent and prices are also not that bad.  The only thing is there was no parking close by,  all are belongs to units.  So got a parking spot way in the back."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better dim sum places I've been to.  Beware the crowds though.  Showed up on Sunday morning at 9:30am trying to secure a table for 4 for for cheap dim sum and wasn't seated until 11:40!"}
{"text":"Went here to grab some dimsum with friends. Waited an hour because they don't take reservations and finally got called up only to have a priority party cut infront of us. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Probably the best,  OK maybe not but still really really good dim sum and food here.  Been a customer with these guys since they were in a smaller location back when they were located at Kennedy and 14th.  100% come here it's good"}
{"text":"I visited on a tuesday morning during the 9-11am dim sum time and managed to avoid this place's infamous crowd. (Pro-tip, the 9-11 slot is cash only so bring plenty). The food is absolutely delicious with decent sized portions. They have new dishes from the traditional dim sum which is fun, so you can pick from classical and new dishes at the same time. I took a star off because you get charged for tea regardless if you want it, which i think is wrong.   Another tip, their soy sauce is one of the best I've had but they dont serve it on the table, so i recommend asking for it once you order."}
{"text":"This place has great dim sum, and has a special before 10:30am.  However, the lines start early and customers mean business. Very hard to find parking. If you don't make the first round of seating, might as well come later because these people like to sit and stay.  If you want to try it out, line up starts at 8:30am - no joke. We go across the street to Eggsmart if we miss the first seating window."}
{"text":"The food there is 5 star but I need to take 1 star off for their service. First of all, there were 4 of us but their rice roll came with 3, so we kindly asked them if they have a scissor or a knife so we can split them fairly. The manager literally just used the chopsticks to cut them open, I admit that it is convenient but he cut it so unevenly it is literally all 3:7 ratio and all the food just fell out. (Then two minutes later the brought us the knife. )   Now let's talk about food, I didn't get to try lots of their dimsum with pork because one of us is allergic to pork, but the siumai is stunning. It is huge and so tasty! The shrimp dumplings had to be the best I have ever eaten in my life, we ordered 2 for each one. I personally do not recommend their Bbq pork bun, the pork has no problem but the bun is really dry. Lastly, their Chinese broccoli with garlic is so good, it is a must try!"}
{"text":"My search for the best dim sums outside of Asia continues in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and for this trip I am focusing on the Markham area.  Dragon Boat has almost all of my most favorite signs of a restaurant with superior dim sums.  -- Parking is close to impossible.  -- Lines start forming outside the door about half an hour to an hour before the restaurant opens.   -- A typical wait on a weekday is half an hour to an hour.  Be prepared to wait up to two hours on a weekend.  --- The waiting area is always packed and completely chaotic.  But despite of all the chaos and the hour-long waits, numerous customers happily return every day and wait patiently for their tables.  These are all the signs of a great dim sum place.  Basic staples like HAR GOW and SIU MAI were amazing and flavorful.  The SIU MAI in particular, was made with top notch ingredients and without even a hint of the after taste of tenderizers that we always find in South Cal.  We particularly liked the FISH FILET IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE which is very hard to find in dim sum places.  The fish filet was delicious and without any fishiness smell or taste (great for me!)  The black bean sauce was good but a bit too mild in flavor for our palates.   I love GLUTINOUS RICE and the one we tasted here was totally yummy and legit.  The filling was lined with a generous layer of authentic mung beans (which are like green peas when they are fresh but turn yellowish when cooked), lean pork, and a salty egg yolk.  It was served with a side of sweet soy sauce and white sugar (exactly how it's supposed to be served.)  The RICE ROLL WITH FRIED DOUGHNUT was very good.  The rice roll itself was a tad too thick but was nevertheless very soft and smooth.  The fried doughnut inside was fresh and crispy.  Another great find that isn't available in many places was the CURRY CHICKEN PIES (or tarts). The curry sauce in the filling was yummy, but a bit mild, and I would compare it with Portuguese curry sauce.  You would love it if you like a light curry sauce that is not too spicy.  As we walked past the reception area when we left, it appeared that it was even far more chaotic than when we arrived -- An obvious sign that we were departing from dim sum heaven..."}
{"text":"I love coming here for dim sum! They've got a great variety to pick from, and the quality is very good. The service is pretty quick, and the staff are generally very responsive. Dragon Boat is definitely my go to place for dim sum.  However, there are a few negatives that people should be aware of. First of all, the wait time is ridiculous. It can range anywhere between 20mins - 1 hour depending on the day and your party size. They have a decent sized waiting area for a Chinese restaurant, however, given the amount of people that are waiting, it's always cramped. So it won't even be a comfortable wait. I came here for dim sum on a Sunday afternoon at 1pm, and when we left at 2:30ish, there was still a line up at the door.  The parking lot is also quite annoying. They have decided to make the parking lot an one way now, so you pretty much have to drive around the entire plaza before getting to the parking spots outside the restaurant. And usually those spots are full, unless you are lucky enough to time it with someone that just left. Then the other parking spots closer by are all reserved for other tenants of the plaza. So you will have to park further away. Since it's an one way street now, it's probably just better to park further away, then to risk driving closer and having no spots, then driving all the way around again.  If you are not a patient person, I would not recommend on coming here for dim sum. However, if you don't mind the wait and the parking situation, I highly recommend the dim sum experience at Dragon Boat!"}
{"text":"One of the best Cantonese Chinese restaurants in GTA.   I don't get the \"Fusion\" in its name; the food is pure Chinese and mostly Cantonese. The decor is clean and not too \"loud' for a Chinese restaurant, but distinctively Chinese.   + Peking Duck is THE best  + Live fish, always steamed to perfect done-ness regardless of size or type of fish  + If (live) scallops in the shells are available, another must-try  + Good Dim Sum selection and quality. The only downside for my friends who prefer push-cart style service is that you have to order from a menu. But that's been the way to serve Dim Sum in most GTA places for years and years now.   Hit this place when you want good Cantonese."}
{"text":"Hmm, odd that I've never reviewed this place despite the fact that I've been here half a dozen times, and once for a wedding.  The food is very good and service is friendly. I've always left nearly sickeningly full. The only thing is, I don't know why they call it \"fusion\". It seems to only have quite typical Cantonese food here.   The only problem is that parking is an absolute nightmare, not a lot of spots and I've heard that if you park at the nearby Moxie's lot, you get a ticket. The prices are more expensive than most places, but you do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about Dragon Boat Fusion Cuisine. However, I am not a fan. I tried both dim sum and dinner. Here are my thoughts.   Dim sum -- Wayyy too fusion-y, to the point where though the dim sum can be quite creative, it just doesn't satisfy the traditional palate.   Dinner -- Decent dishes, but wayyy overpriced.   In general, waits are also ridiculous."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now for lunch. This is my favourite place for Chinese food. Authentic dishes. Waiters are nice. The restaurant is big and clean. I've been to other Chinese restaurants for lunch, and I just have to say all the other places in Richmond Hill cannot compare!"}
{"text":"My grandmothers favorite restaurant! Always come here for big family celebration dinners! Their are also a huge hit for dim sum and the wait is ridiculous but well worth it! They have some unique dim sum & some with fancy plating/presentation! High quality food in general w/ good service. Parking however is terrible - lots of spots are reserved so be careful!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for almost three years now and the quality of the dim sum has never gone down! Huge fan of the har gow, char siu buns, siu mai, steamed oxtail and egg custard buns (to die for). Every time I'm back in town, my family comes here at least once to properly satisfy all dim sum cravings.  The only two complaints I have are (1) the lack of shanghai dim sum options (hi where is my xiaolongbao and guo tie) and (2) the ridiculous wait times after 10 AM. So the restaurant opens at 9 AM with an early bird special of $3.99 pricing for all size dim sum plates before 11:30 AM, but if you arrive any time after 10 AM  without a reservation your wait time WILL be longer than 1.5 hours no matter what they tell you. I arrived once at 11:30 AM thinking the rush of people would've passed since the early bird special was passed and was told there would be a 30 minute wait--not too bad. I waited until 1:00 PM and was still not seated and at that point with the hostess telling me it would still be a 45 minute wait I gave up.   TL;DR arrive early and arrive hungry -- if you're seated immediately you'll absolutely love your dim sum experience."}
{"text":"Great place for dim sum. Nice decor/ambiance and very good quality of food. Arrive before 11am to get a discount on the bill. Har gow comes with a prawn in the centre. Really enjoyed the beef balls, ha cheung (shrimp rice rolls), and chicken feet. Also had their peking duck (you need to pre-order 24 hrs in advance...$33). Great presentation (duck came on a big verically upright metal rod where it was skinned to make the wrap dish). Aside from the usual cucumbers, onions and hoisin sauce, it also came with raisins, fresh fruits and mini marshmallows (not sure I see the need for the marshmallows but the waiter said it's for tables with young children to snack on...except we weren't dining with any children). I liked the wrap...a little sweeter than usual.  Very busy restaurant so make a reservation (and even though I made one I still waited 20-30 mins for my table)."}
{"text":"4.5 stars because the food here is legit awesome, BUT the line-up is insane. We happened to arrive at the right time when it opened, and got seated without waiting, but I know this is unusual.  Ordered 11 dishes - everything was super yums. My favourite was the bean curd vegetable wrap. The turnip sesame thing was delicious. The har gow is a bit much, loaaaaded with shrimp which some might like, but I actually prefer the smaller version. The curry chicken pie was well done. A tad sweet for me though.  All in all, great food, but I don't know if I would wait over an hour for it..."}
{"text":"Went for dimsum on Saturday and it was packed.  Waited almost an hour.  The lady manager in red was a total disaster.  She took my order but messed up and never entered into the system.  I had to talk to the manager Sunny and he realized that they screwed....so it took us about 1.5hrs until we started eating.  I do have to admit that the food was decent but the service was so crap that im not coming back again!"}
{"text":"The Dragon Boat Specialty Dim Sum Platter (????) arrived next.  This looked so appealing on the menu that I just had to get it to try.  This platter had two tiers of food on it like the high tea sets!  It was so fancy!  The bottom tier had some seaweed salad, sweet beans, pickled chicken feet, Deep Fried Turnip with Ham and Sesame, and a pork bun wrapped in seaweed.  The top tier had the desserts:  egg tart, coffee jello, coconut jello molded into a piece of papaya, Baked BBQ Pork Puff Pastry, and a small selection of fruits.  This was an amazing dim sum platter and I'd never seen anything like it!  We had to take photos to commemorate this unique dim sum experience.  In this platter, I really liked the coffee jello, coconut-papaya dessert, and the Deep Fried Turnip with Ham and Sesame.  The Deep Fried Seaweed Roll with Shrimp & Fish (????) was really, really good!  This was really crispy and freshly fried shrimp and fish in a roll with nori on the inside.  This was one of my favourites that day.  The Steamed Beef Tripe with Ginger & Green Onion (?????) was really tender and came in a plentiful portion.  I love it when beef tripe is tender and has soaked up all of the sauce.  Yum!  The Steamed Avocado & Eel Rice Rolls (?????) was definitely one of the most unique rice noodle rolls I've ever had.  The avocado chunks were freshly green-coloured and there were significant amounts of it as well as the eel inside the rice roll.  The avocado and eel made such a great combination in the rice roll.  I would love to eat this again."}
{"text":"Visited on Sun Dec 14 at 9am! This place doesn't take reservations, that's an automatic 1 star deduction. There was a mess of 30-40 people at the front waiting for a table, it's good that they're popular. Since they don't take reservations, we had a group of 10 so my party came early to get a table. I would hate having to wait 30 min just for a meal. Parking is a bit tough as it's a surface lot, and majority of the spots are reserved for specific businesses. I didn't see the food ordering process as my party did it before I arrived, it's just ordering by ticking off items on a sheet. They don't have push carts. Noise level a bit loud. Price per person was about $15, so very reasonable considering the number of dishes we had and we had leftover to take home. I would only come back if they start taking reservations. The low price before 11am strategy is interesting, personally I would pay more to eat in a quiet environment with a restaurant that takes reservations. The food was very good, no complaints."}
{"text":"Best sub $3 dim sum in Toronto hands down. There are better full price places, but from 9 - 11 am, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I just want to let you all know that they are under reno right now because of an accident. Call before you go. They said they would likely re-open in early September.   Dimsum are pretty good here. However, the waiting time is just way too long. They should have a better system on queueing. Something like sending people a message when the table is ready kind of thing would be very helpful."}
{"text":"Cute dimsum place! Love all the dishes and it is one of the best dimsum places I have been. It is very hard to get seats like any other dimsum restaurant in Toronto, wait time is approximately 30 to 45 mins, but well worth the wait. They have special pricing from when they open until 11am, all dishes are only one price."}
{"text":"I don't really understand how the \"fusion\" part applies to this restaurant as most of the items I read on the menu were typical Cantonese-style cuisine.  Unless you're counting the sugared cashews or wakame salad that they serve at the beginning of your meal in a dipping bowl to be \"fusion\".  But alas, as with most Chinese restaurants, its better to just nod your head than to understand the English names they list themselves as.  The service was exceptional, and I find that that's what differentiates so called Chinese \"fine dining' restaurants from the usual mom and pop shop.  The food itself is not much different IMHO.  So just remember that Chinese \"fine dining\" = typical Chinese fare with service.   We ordered the Roasted Succulent Pork & BBQ Platter (BBQ portion is choice of BBQ pork, roast duck, etc), Dried Scallop, Scallions & Egg White Fried Rice, as well as a Mixed Mushroom, Vegetable & Vermicelli Medley.    The vegetable and mushroom dish was the first dish that was cranked out.  It had straw mushrooms, shiitake and wood ear mushrooms and came with baby bok choy and what I think was spinach.  It wasn't overly salty, the vermicelli soaked in all the flavours, and I loved the melange of textures from the various mushrooms.  You got a crunch from the wood ears, the tenderness and denseness from the shiitakes, and the straw mushrooms, well they're my favourite, and I love the bamboo-shoot-like texture of them.   The second dish to come out was the pork and it was nicely roasted.  The skin was nice and crispy without being too oily, and it felt like I was eating a potato chip.  The roast duck however, was a little too fatty and greasy for my liking, albeit, it was bursting with intense ducky flavour!  It was served with the traditional pork dipping sauce (but strangely, also with mustard sauce?!) and the duck came with the plum sauce.  The fried rice for me was a little bit bland, and I do not advise parents to order this dish for children as the size of the scallions were ridiculously large, and hard to swallow.  There was free dessert.  It was a black-eyed peas sweet soup with bean curd.  The sweet soup was extremely watered down, and tasted gross.  All I ate were the black-eyed peas which were nice and tender.  All in all, 3 stars.  Perhaps a proper 10-course dinner or dim-sum experience would enable me to write a more complete review. But for now, 3 stars!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about high quality and affordable dim sum!? Come before 9am, actually 15-20 minutes before 9am to queue-up and get the discounted price of $2.80 (s, m, l dishes only; excludes xl dishes). You have to pay in cash/leave before 11am to get the discounted price. Be prepared to walk briskly and claim a table once the doors open. It's a bit of an unorganized process and somewhat akin to Black Friday or Boxing Day shopping! There's a mad dash to get a table!   You get to select all of the dishes on paper and they are brought out orderly. The dishes are piping hot and fresh. They have your standard HK style dim sum dishes, but they also have some different dishes that I've never had before -- bolo style bbq buns, green tea and peanut crepe, oxtail stew, etc. Overall a great selection of savory, sweet, steamed, fried, and sautéed dishes. This is a must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Sounds weird coming from a Chinese guy, but I hate dim sum. I have to thank my parents for a wonderful job they did to make me resent dim sum so much lol..  Anyway, I was genuinely surprised by the quality of the food here. I wasn't expecting much because I always think dim sum restaurants are the same, kind of like McDonalds. I think I can take that comment back because the food was fresh here. I have no complaints this time and I actually enjoyed my stay here.  You saw the rating correctly, it's 4 and not 5. I took off a star because of the lack of management present at this restaurant. They do a really terrible job getting people to wait in numerical order. The worst part is the woman that's supposed to be keeping track with the crowd doesn't stay put.. Terribad. They also charged me 3 extra dishes that didn't come, so I had to get the manager on deck to sort things out. What a pain.."}
{"text":"This is top notch Asian cuisine. All the dishes are seasoned and prepared to perfection. Service is pretty good too where typically asian restaurants do not cater to customer service."}
{"text":"Dragon Boat Fusion Cuisine is located in Richmond Hill.  The decor is modern gold and white theme.  The service is generally quick and efficient - typical of Chinese restaurants. There is usually a long line - so plan accordingly.  The food is delicious and the price is reasonable.   We came here for dinner. We ordered a set dinner that came with soup, fried rice and stir fried sliced beef & mushrooms. The quality of the dishes were better than some of the other Chinese restaurants around down. The ingredients tasted fresh and the dishes were well prepared. For that reason alone, I would recommend Dragon Boat Fusion Cuisine."}
{"text":"Dim sum is good but only the problem is hard to get table around noon which is normal with any good Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is crowded because they offer discounted dim sum before 11am. However, I would say the dim sum craftsmanship and flavor (or the lack of) is average, but the portion is large. The restaurant decor is nice/clean, and the service is friendly. If you don't go there early, even on a weekday, be prepare to wait. Personally, I prefer Legend's dim sum better than this place."}
{"text":"Alway busy in the morning, don't expect to find parking near the restaurant, there's usually two gentlemen wearing an orange reflective vest telling people to park near the Keg.  Aside from parking, the restaurant inside is pretty big with large fish tanks and a wine rack near the front entrance. If you're planning on going for dim sum, I suggest you go extra early around 8/9 or later around 1, otherwise expect waiting 30 minutes to an hour for a seat.   Food here is amazing, especially their egg white tart!! Good portions, relatively cheap for a fancier dim sum environment, and great presentations. One of the best place for dim sum in the Richmond hill area!"}
{"text":"Classic and authentic Cantonese.  Highly recommended.  Had dimsum here for the first time with extended family that included two uncles who characterize themselves as foodies; one of whom had the VIP card (for discount of 10%).  Had reservations for 11 am Saturday, and the place was just starting to fill up.  By 12.30pm when we left, the place was packed (I only saw Asian faces and heard only Cantonese conversations - though given the menus are also English I don't think not knowing Cantonese would be an impediment).    The food was clean, fresh with excellent flavor sans msg (or at least noticeable msg).  My favorites would be the Har Gow (steamed shrimp dumpling), the \"crispy egg tarts\" (the perfect level of flakiness), and the Steamed Egg Yolk Cream Bun (see pic - it's the perfect level of gooeyness, sweetness and consistency - though admittedly this may be a personal taste that may not be suitable for western palates).  I confess it's the last dish that really sold me.  Other places generally make the filling more doughey with a more textured consistency but this was just the way I remember it at one of my favorite dim sum places in Hong Kong.  I think I figured out the mystery of why they call themselves \"fusion\" - as they seem to have a few Malaysian dishes in their a la carte menu at least for lunch (see pics).  One area I would dock them on is the cleanliness of their washrooms - though perhaps this was a function of the volume of the people who had gone through by 12.30pm just before I left. To the credit of their designers, it's tough to really notice if the washroom is really all that dirty because of the rough stone type tile, but there were a number of paper towels/garbage on the floor and the mirror appeared to be dirty.    I'd note that their facilities seem to be pretty nice and modern with muted tones (see pics).  The fact that everything seems padded also helps a bit with the noise which didn't seem to approach the airport landing level volumes (though still loud as it usually is for Chinese restaurants, particularly for dimsum).   The parking immediately around the restaurant is limited with most of it being reserved for other tenants.  Tip - park in the lower parking lot, don't even go up to the level where the restaurant is at or else you'll probably have to drive around the entire mall to get back or end up walking a lot further to find space that isn't reserved.    The cost for 10 of us came to $89 pre-tax, tip and discount - which is definitely cheap for what you get so I think $10-15 per person including tip is not an unreasonable expectation here.  We'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Really good dimsum place. Prepare to wait 45-1 hour for a table.  Well worth the wait.   Everything we ordered was delish!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-3 Service-5 Food-5 Strikeouts-0/3  Came here for family dinner for 14 so our dinner was huge! Lots of dishes and each one exceeded the next in my opinion.  We opened up with Peking duck not only included a tiny show showing them peel the duck on a stand for us, but also was probably the best Peking duck I've had in a while. This was done real well. Not too gamey, not too loose, it was the perfect medium. Plus, they have a shit ton of toppings to put into the wrap and there was enough wraps in one go to use up all the Peking duck.   The next dish that surprised me was the beef dish. It tasted very different from usual for some reason. It was definitely the sauce that changed it all up and it made the meat so juicy!! I was enjoying it so much that if I mixed the juice with white rice, the combo would be deadly!!! Deadly delicious!!  The last dish that was easily the best dish in my opinion was the semi deep fried EEL. The breading tasted delicious with both sweet Thai-ish flavour but also very crispy *drool*.   This dinner made me very happy despite having stomach problems the last few days. I forced myself to eat more than I could."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious dim sum and beautiful presentation. No question about it, probably one of the best in town.   My only concern is the extremely long wait times for a table and even to get your food sometimes. We waited probably a good 45 mins for a table for 2. One of our dishes came out nearly an hour after we were seated but luckily the other food items came out sooner."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum lunch today.  We arrived at 10.45am and managed to get our order in before 11am, to get the early bird special.   We ordered a variety of dim sum, for the 5 of us.  Most of the dishes were a really big size or had an extra 4th dumpling.  Dim sum is supposed to be small delicious morsels of deliciousness.   Most of the food was ok but too salty and full of msg for my liking.  I was thirsty from the first bite until way into the afternoon.    Can not understand why this place is so crowded.  The outside of the place is extremely unattractive and parking is a hassle.  You can't park right outside, those spaces are all reserved.  The waiters kept walking around with licence plate numbers, asking those folks to move their cars.  I only came here because the older folks wanted to come here, I was just the chauffeur.  I would not choose to come back here again, nor would I subject my kids to their salt and MSG laden dim sum.  Only gave an extra star because it was cheap and was only $58(tips extra) for 12 dishes."}
{"text":"First time here for dim sum. Really good food, fast service, friendly staff, lots of dim sum variety, price is fair for GTA.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Make reservations whenever you can. Great food, but very typical Chinese service - rushed, and somewhat non-apologetic. If you're there for the food, then this is the place. Also, beware that parking is a bit of a bitch."}
{"text":"I had to try this place because of the fois gras dumplings and Truffle dumplings as well.  I made reservations in the morning for a 1pm seating. Got there at 1pm but waited for a good 45min before I got seating. I was so hungry I wanted to die.  As we got seated, we ordered right away, the food came on a timely manner but I wasn't impressed. I usually go to Casa Victoria for this kind of thing as the prices are pretty similar and upscale for a dim sum place.   The wait time is insane even if you make reservations  ... so my advice to you is either eat here and make reservations for 10:30am, skip 12noon - 1:30pm as this is prime time and wont make a difference if you made a reservation or not ... and either come at 2:00pm or later for your dimsum carvings.  The dishes were ok for dimsum.   Also came here for dinner ... The dinner dishes we ordered was a $600 set course for 6-7 people ... but I had the runs when I got home.   Service wise, the service was ok. Not over the top, and a bit lacking. They don't really care when there's a huge line out the door. You just have to be patient and wait if you planning to eat here lunch time. Dinner time it is less crazy."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in richmond hill. More expensive than golden court, premier ballroom (diu yu toi) and emperor but the quality is there.   BEWARE though. Without a reservation don't even bother cuz even if u have one you'll still have to wait a good period of time. The wait time is a nightmare because the restaurant is sooo packed. In fact, they hired their own parking instruction guys to direct traffic lol. The parking lot is also a nightmare because its a one way parking lot and a ton of drivers dont obey the one way signs. Thankfully it's connected to an adjacent lot that has much more parking.   The pork in the siu mai is ground by hand in the kitchen as opposed to being ground by machine (tastes much more tender and fresh). I thought the har gao (shrimp dumpling) couldve had a thinner rice crepe; the shrimp was really good. They offer oxtail as an item which is rare (only other place I rmbr having it was Gold Mark in markham). The bbq pork bun with pineapple topping is a MUST TRY (for all you ppl foreign to dim sum). Also the bbq pork with rice (the bbq pork at this place is amazing, trust). The curry octopus was mediocre. I've had much better. It tasted like the octopus was drenched in watered down sriracha. Try the honey glazed beef spare ribs. Those are bomb as well.   Yea so check this place out. It's slightly more expensive than any other place in richmond hill but the quality is there. And REMEMBER TO MAKE YOUR RESERVATION otherwise \"i told you so\"."}
{"text":"Crap service, as expected from a dim sum place. But the dim sum selection and quality make up for it. Food is fresh and they don't skimp out on the good ingredients (e.g. Shrimp)"}
{"text":"I've only been here for dim sum.  Food was great... you have your staples... shrimp dumplings, flat noodles, etc. Bu they also have twists on the classics and some newish items like Durian pastry.  Which has become one of our favorites.  We also love haw gow (shrimp dumplings) and the woo gawk (little taro pastries).  My only complain is the place is too popular during the discount times and the line up is insane.  luckily we out wait another group and they gave up and gave us their number in line.  Otherwise we would be waiting 45+ mins. Not easy with impatient kids."}
{"text":"We came here during dinner time.  We did not know that we could not get Dim Sum food at dinner time.  We had dinner anyway. We ordered Steamed sea bass and braised pork ribs in sweet and sour pork.  Taste was okay but I put 2/5 for the reason this place is a lot pricier than other places for the same quality.  Steamed sea bass was CAD40 for one whole fish. I can get a tastier steamed sea bass for the same size at CAD26 in another restaurant. Good things there is free dessert.   Washroom is reasonably clean with 4 cubicles.  And customer service is great though it would be tough if you don't speak Chinese. I will not come back for dinner.  I will come for dim sum next time."}
{"text":"Considering you have to show up here at 8:50am to get a table they are down to one star. Not to mention no more discount on weekends. WTF do people line up for this cesspool? The har gau and shumai are massive which isn't a good thing. Banned."}
{"text":"I like the food there but the wait time is always long.  I have been there several times during 11am-1pm. I had to wait for at least 15 mins even if I had a reservation or 1.5 hours if I didnt.   I recommend this restaurant if you are not hungry and have time to wait - because the food does tastes good.   Parking spots are very limited but there is a big parking lot across the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not worth it for the line ups. Came here for dimsum after 2pm today and still had more than a 30 minute wait for a table. No early bird specials on weekends.   The thing that made the experience worse was the wait between each of our dishes, took them more than an hour to serve five dishes and finally at 4pm, after wondering what happened to our dessert dish, they tell us they forgot and the kitchen has closed. They apologized and said they had removed it from the bill (no really?). Disappointing... so we went elsewhere for dessert after. Other dim sum places are much quicker. Felt like we sat without food, just waiting, the whole time. Also how do they always run out of the baked bbq pork bun pastry?  When each dish did finally come, they were demolished pretty quick. Food was just OK, definitely not worth both the wait at the door nor the wait sitting. Recommend the fried shrimp almond balls and mini beef with black bean sauce pastry pies, although it could do with more filling."}
{"text":"Made the long trek up to Richmond Hill from downtown on a whim to try a new dim sum place.  Arrived at about 11:30am on a Saturday, and the wait was only about 30 min.  They give you a number and you wait to get called.  The prices are a bit higher than average, but then, the quality and portions are better, as well.  the har gow were quite large, and the squid tentacles were some of the best we've ever had.  Their soy-sheet-wrapped mushrooms weren't to our liking, but only because we were expecting something different.  Solid 4-star.  We'd go back more often if we weren't so far."}
{"text":"One of the better dim sum places in Markham in my opinion.   Very hard to find parking as the plaza is rather small and spots are reserved for specific stores, but that being said, during the morning, you can park in the parking lot where The Keg is located.   The food there is flavourful and not too full of msg. Your typical dim sum dishes plus a few special spins. I personally love their BBQ pork buns with the sweet topping buns (don't recall what it is in English). Sweet bun from the cookie topping (like a polo bun) yet the BBQ pork inside gives it a savoury umami taste. Their typical siu mai and ha gow are good too as their shrimp tastes fresh. Nonetheless they are known for their BBQ pork so that's always a good dish to order in the afternoon.  Their dinner menu is full of options as well. Sometimes a bit inconsistent with quality but overall flavours are evident and good.   I come here on a regular basis as they are great for large family dinners and gatherings."}
{"text":"I came here around 1pm on a Saturday and the place was packed. Like every Asian dim sum restaurant, you'll have to squish your way inside to get a seat. We waited about 40 minutes to be seated at a table. By that time we were ravenous and ordered just about everything on the menu. They do have a selection of non-dim sum dishes such as fried noodles, rice, or vegetable dishes which are available after 11am or so. After we ordered, each item slowly trickled to our table, so by the time our last item arrived we were stuffed and had actually already asked for that item to be cancelled.   In terms of the dim sum, it tasted quite good. Since I'm not from the area, I can't compare to other restaurants in the area, but it's definitely much better than the dim sum that I've had throughout Mississauga. They have a cute tea platter, but I found it too excessive to order and thought I would've enjoyed more traditional dishes more anyway. Every dish arrived at the table piping hot and tasted quite good. The only items I didn't particularly like were the curry squid, which had a powdery texture to it and the deep fried taro and quail egg fritters, which was far too greasy - it literally dripped oil when I bit into it.   If you're a fan of dim sum or just want to give it a try, definitely check this place out. Service may not be the best, but that's pretty typical for these types of restaurants. Also, if you want to avoid the line, come super early or arrive after 2pm!"}
{"text":"Came on Easter Sunday....it was a mad house and waited for over 1.5hrs but when we got our table we went all out.  Each dish that we had ordered was delicious...maybe because we were hungry after waiting that long but regardless it was freaking good.  My favorite would be the Ox-tail, Beef Tendon, Sui-Mai....well I love them all :-)  Was it worth the wait?  Yes and I would do it again if I have to cause it was yum yum in my tum tum!!"}
{"text":"We came here a few time and figure to write a review. The season we had was very good. The food overall is very good. The price is definitely better then other seafood restaurant comparing. The service is very good and it's a great place to have a large table."}
{"text":"Awwhh yee - this place is the shit.  Went for 12pm dim sum on a Sunday. Wait time was to be expected and we didn't get seated until 1pm for a party of 8. But that was okay. With a place this popular and no reservations, it only heightened the hunger (though this is just my optimism speaking).   Highlights: Salted egg-yolk buns (YES!), BBQ puff pastry, baked BBQ pork bun pastry (pineapple bun topping) - a lot of other dim sum places in the GTA don't have these.   Everything else was pretty standard but much better than other dim sum places. Portions were bigger, juicier, and filling. I would recommend making reservations ahead of time, especially if you're in a big group, that way you can sample and share a lot of different dishes.   Overall, would come back again :D"}
{"text":"I'll rate it 3.5 but I can't give this place a 4 as my standards are pretty high and I definitely have had much better options before.  I tried both their dim sum and chinese dinner here. Their dim sum was decent but I kind of was expecting better quality than what I would get in LA and this place sadly didn't help. The shrimp dumplings (Har Gow), the shrimp was okay but the wrapping was too thick. Sadly I have had better in LA. I enjoyed their BBQ pork pastry which was good. They make the triangular shape. Not sure if the new norm is now serving that way but I grew up eating the rectangular shaped BBQ pork pastry.   Their beef and shrimp noodle rolls were decent. They served hot soy sauce on the side for you to pour which was new to me. Usually it's served lukewarm. That was a nice touch.  Their siu mai (pork/shrimp) dumpling was alright. Nothing to praise about this one.  I ordered the curry baby squids which were really good. I don't think it's a thing in LA and I grew up eating this so definitely a nice dim sum to order.  Tried the chicken glutinuous rice wrapped in some leaf and that was as expected. Good but nothing to write home about.  I tried this Quail egg deep fried taro ball which was unique but not sure if the egg was supposed to be runny or not as it was served soft boiled. It was okay, not sure I would order this again.  I also tried some dessert, they didn't have Malaysian sponge cake but something else which was just Mantau bread sheets with sweetened salty egg yolk. It was okay but not sure I would order this again.   They have a promotion where if you order by 11am, your dim sum will be charged at small size rate which at the time was $3.30 a plate. That probably explains the busyness of this establishment before 11am. They charge mandatory $1.50 a person for tea.  Few days later I tried the dinner selections. I have no idea on the prices as my aunt treated us but let's put it this way, I enjoyed their dinner more than their dim sum.  We got the standard communal soup which consisted of pork, carrots, and watercrest. Good but nothing special as I can make this at home.  I tried the Peking duck which had an odd presentation. Refer to my picture and you'll see why. Maybe it's a LA thing but here they serve the expected flour flat wraps to eat with your duck but in LA, seems like they use Mantau bread as the bread to wrap with their ducks. I prefer the flour flat wraps as I also grew up eating it that way as well. The condiments served were a little odd though. There were marshmallows, raisins, strawberries, cantaloupe, and honey dew slices. Not quite sure why they were there. Definitely didn't make any sense to me. I just used the typical green onion slices and hoisin sauce with my duck.   Next were chinese style pork ribs which were very good. Very juicy and great sauce. I would order it again. Little tricky to eat with chopsticks. I opted to eat with my hands.  Next were snow pea leafs with some bean burds and dried scallop shreds with chicken broth. This was good and healthy.  Then we tried the shrimp and broccoli. The shrimp was coated with mayo (similar to Honey walnut shrimp dishes people are accustomed to). That was good.  Then we tried the beef slices with various vegetables. There were some pineapple slices in it which was nice. Gave a nice sweet and savory experience.  Next dish was various vegetables and shrooms. Similar flavoring as the previous vegetable dish.  Another dish with bok choy and soft tofu. The round brown tofu were very good and had awesome texture and full of flavor from the wet broth coated in. I'd order this again.  We also tried Mapo tofu, standard good flavor and mild heat. Excellent to go with rice.  Next was a whole chicken which was flavored as if we were eating fish. Lots of green onion slices, sweet wine , cilnatro, and some red pepper strips. I really enjoyed this dish. Chicken was very juicy and cooked perfectly.  Desserts we got some gochi jello, cookies, and a red grain soup. Nothing special but good way to end a meal. I'd come here again for their dinner."}
{"text":"Unique dishes that you must try for dimsum: - deep fried taro with quail egg. That's right, with a quail egg.  - seafood dumpling, flavourful broth - Deep fried tentacles (XL for $5.80. Note that XL does not apply to early bird special, sadface)   Pro tip:  Parking - don't think that you can park at the other vendors and get away with it. The wait staff actually walked around the restaurant on several occasions, holding a piece of paper with a license plate numbers that are about to be towed.  To summarize, Dragon Boat fusion definitely...floats my boat. #MicDrop"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Chinese restaurants in the GTA. Their king crab is one of their specialties where they cook it in several different ways: steamed with garlic and deep fried. The environment is OK, doesn't feel too clean to be honest but for the food you're getting, it's worth it."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! I've been going here before they changed ownership and it was already DELICIOUS for my dim sum cravings.  Now that they have changed ownership it is even more impressive, almost luxurious with their 'personalized' bamboo boxes and different varieties of our basic dim sum options  Hands down my favorite thousand year layer cake! OMG SOO good!!!!! always love to eat this. Their other options that we always order is their yolk buns and Portuguese chicken   You definitely need to expect a long wait time! We knew people and had discount card for this restaurant but still always expect a long wait for dim sum (I suggest going really late --- like almost last seating around after 2pm). OR you can go really early *discount and cheaper on dishes before 11am every morning.   I just don't like coming in the weekday for fear of parking violation/ ticket! THere's really no where to park but at the parking lot across the street which is for business offfices --- they say that if you get a ticket, you can give it to the restaurant and they will \"compensate\" but I've never had that happen to me since I only usually come on the weekends and very rare occasion on the weekday."}

{"text":"This place is amazing! Best dim sum in the GTA for sure. It can take a long while to get a table if you don't have a reservation - I'm talking an hour to an hour and a half. Even with a reservation, you may have a bit of a wait... But the food is so good that the wait is worth it. They care about the presentation of their food, which makes it that much more enjoyable to eat there. All the dumplings are good choices, as well as the usual dim sum offerings (chicken feet, rice rolls). A must-try are the gigantic deep-fried shrimp balls with almonds - they are my absolute favourite!"}
{"text":"Gave this place another try and definitely an improvement. Food was great, very tasty and reasonable prices. Customer service was alright although we couldn't see the host as she was chatting away.   Overall, no complaints. If you come Monday to Friday before 11 am there is fixed pricing. I tried coming on a weekend as well and it is packed you can forget it unless you wait min 1 hour!   Dishes I enjoyed: Siu mai, chicken feet, angus beef rolls, hai gao, spare ribs with tarp and the pineapple bun with bbq pork inside."}
{"text":"I finally gave this place a second chance today. I had an auntie that was in town and was staying in the Markham area, so I thought \"let's go for dim sum\". I originally wanted to go to another place but they were under renovations so I decided to come here instead. I called in advance to book a table because knowing the Markham and Richmond Hill area, dim sum is prime time and typically a very long wait if you don't call to reserve for a table. They only start taking reservations at 11 am, so I booked a table right at 11 am to minimize the wait time for our party of six people.   The pricing for dim sum is not the cheapest, I would say it is en par with the area. The dim sum quality is good here and the servers this time around were better then the last time I was here. They had people that came to refile the tea pots so I didn't have to constantly wave at someone to come over to refile the tea pots.   I would definitely say I would come here for dim sum. For dinner, I am not so sure because like I said I finally gave this place a second chance after my initial visit here ... which was like back in 2015 based on my previous review. Maybe I will come here for dinner in the future... time will tell. But at this very moment, I would have to say my dim sum experience was better then my dinner experience here."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for people who like seafood ! The prices are great and not to expensive ! But if u dont like seafood tgere all a lot of things u can pick from !"}
{"text":"Mad a reservation and still habe to wait. Parking is terrible here as well in the front of the resteraunt there is lots of parking but reserved for the vip which is stupid. Never will come back here."}
{"text":"I understand this is an Asian resto and should naturally lower my expectations but this place took bad service to a whole new level. It's fine that when I order an addition item you tell me it's sold out. Okay. Happened twice fine. But when I had ordered something 40mins ago and you have to have me remind you of the order only to tell me that even that's sold out, I've hit my bottling point. And didn't even offer an apology until I complained. Only said \"it's sold out\" like really. Never coming back!!! And it's a shame because the food is actually half decent but the service is just unacceptable."}
{"text":"Went for dimsum at around 11am..got a table around 1215pm.. quite the wait. There is zero parking in front of the restaurant..and they now have a 'parking enforcer' to ensure no one parks in the reserved spots. Parking for the restaurant is at the side and back. Not very convenient. And..if you do decide to park in a reserved spot..be prepared to have a waiter flash your license plate around the diners looking for you! ... and you car will probably be towed if you don't move it. They were quite strict..and made quite a few diners upset (especially the elderly)....   Food took a while to come..and I must say..quality isnt as good as I remember.   Definitely not coming back for a long time."}
{"text":"Clean and authentic Hong Kong style dim sum without much msg used in their food or none at all. Quality of food is fresh and reminds me of the golden days of NYC Chinatown dim sum in the early 90's (unadulterated flavors, that is). Wait was about 30-40 minutes but I heard can be up to an hour. Plenty of parking at the lot below the restaurant which is situated on higher level roadway with only 3-5 spots available in front of the restaurant itself. If nothin else, I guarantee you will be satisfied with the shu mai and shrimp rice rolls!"}
{"text":"Been here more than 10 times and it always has consistently great food and service, nice atmosphere, and overall fantastic dinning experience. The price is a little steep, but the quality of the food makes up for it. The wait time to get a table can be quite long, especially on weekends, so definitely recommend to make reservations for large groups. But once seated, the food comes out quickly and the staff consistently come to fill the tea pots and change plates.   Lots of great seafood here, especially fresh since it's still swimming before you order. One thing I don't like is they weigh the seafood by weight in a big plastic box, and watching them, they don't reset the scale to subtract the weight of the box. So you end up paying 2-3x the cost of the same Alaskan King Crab that you can get at T&T, plus you end up paying for the weight of the big plastic box plus all the water that's sitting at the bottom. When you are paying $300-$400 for one crab, I don't want to be paying extra just because they are too lazy to weigh the seafood properly. To me, this is a sleezy way to boost margins when the cost of the seafood is already high enough. But, the King Crab dishes they prepare are so good that sometimes you just have to look the other way when they are cheating on you!   If cost is not an issue, this place is definitely one of the better places to get high end Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have no idea how much it costed for dinner. We came as a party and had a set meal. It was a meal for 10, but we added 2 people's worth of food to it.  Had: Sucking pig and jellyfish - suckling pig was not bad, but I've also had much better. Jellyfish was bland. Usually, it tastes of sesame oil. This one tasted minutely of salt. Honey pepper oyster - probably my favorite dish of the night. Oyster was served piping hot and crispy. Sauce was just right. It didn't overwhelm the oyster. Oyster was fresh and very decently sized. I liked how they served it atop a lettuce wrap.  Lobster bisque with shark fin - Not enough lobster meat or lobster taste. This one was a tad ambiguous for me. It was presented nicely in a bowl atop a tea light burner to keep it bubbling while we drank it (left it a tad too hot for me. I burned my tongue). It tasted mildly like cheese sauce, or pumpkin soup, but I believe it was supposed to be lobster bisque. There was one chunk of lobster in it, and perhaps a piece of scallop. There were also strands of shark fin. I have yet to find a fusion-style shark fin soup I like, and this one was no exception. Abalone with baby bok choy - abalone was nice and tender. Bok choy was fresh. Deep fried shrimp with honey sauce, pan fried scallop and assorted pan fried veggies - I'm not sure how these two work together, but they were served together and on the same plate. The deep fried shrimp was nice and crispy and the honey in the sauce was evident. The scallop was tender, but not as sweet as I'd have liked it. The veggies consisted of snow pea shoots, mixed peppers, zucchini and perhaps some other things I've forgotten. White asparagus spears, snow pea shoots with lobster sauce, king oyster mushrooms - Yet another dish that was plated together, but for an as-of-yet undetermined reason. The asparagus spears were stringy. The snow pea shoots with lobster sauce were quite tasty, and the lobster sauce had a lot of lobster meat shredded into it. The king oyster mushrooms weren't noteworthy, but they weren't bad. Actually, the lobster sauce might have been crab sauce...it's been a couple of days. I've forgotten. Chicken - free range. Fairly good. Juicy. Not dry in the least. Steamed fish - not sure what kind. Not very big. Enough for each person to have a bite and a half. Wonton noodles with yu choy - Palate cleanser? I prefer e fu noodles at the end of my meal, just because I like to end dinner with some kind of taste in my mouth. Seafood fried rice - another palate cleanser. Meh. Dessert - mung bean sweet soup, cookies, papaya with coconut milk jelly on top - the papaya was an interesting idea, but the papaya wasn't sweet enough and the coconut milk could have been a tad stronger.  This could have been a fairly pleasant experience, but our server, Jade, seemed irritated the entire night. Each time we asked her to do something like get us new tea, or serve us on individual plates, or even remove our plates, she had to say something snippy. It was quite irksome.  This place also does the weirdest thing I've ever seen with Peking duck. They don't cut the duck while the duck is lying down. They raise it so that it looks like the duck has been speared, bottom end first, on a big metal tube, and then cut off the skin. What it ends up looking like is like they're stripping the duck and displaying it for the entire restaurant to see. We didn't have the duck, but we watched this process being repeated time and time again throughout the night. Did I mention that this entire process takes place on a display that looks like a boat? It's a tad difficult to describe in words, but the whole display seemed almost...vulgar.  I'm sure I'll come here again, as I have relatives who quite enjoy this place, but I wouldn't voluntarily come myself."}
{"text":"Dragon Boat never disappoints for the food. Parking and the line-up can deter most people but it is worth the wait. Got there super early around 10 am to avoid the lines but needed to park at the back. Keep in mind that the closest parking will likely be taken and you may get a parking ticket where the offices are located. More parking is located at the back of the Keg.  The dim sum was great and came out from the kitchen in little time. Instead of being served in the round baskets, they are served in square containers. During the week, the price for SML sizes before 11 am orders were the same with a few exceptions indicated by the star beside the item. Surprisingly, it was busier after the specials were over despite the cold.  Overall, I would return but will always try to avoid the lines. I especially like the soup dumpling and har gaw."}
{"text":"I came here last Thursday with my family and we had a table of 10. We had a HUGE assortment of super fresh seafood prepared the traditional Cantonese way.  No MSG, not overly salty - just simple and delicious high end cantonese food.  I am not sure where the \"fusion\" is because nothing was fusion that we ordered.  I really enjoyed the lobster (we ordered a 3.5 lb lobster!) Deep fried oysters (not the kind with alot of batter, super light and tasty!) Roast Suckling pig was awesome as was the duck that it came with.  I normally don't enjoy sea cucumber but it was pretty good here!  definitely better than other places that I have tried!  I highly recommend this place! Kudo's to my mom for finding it!  Even if you are inexperienced with traditional Cantonese food, you'll enjoy this place! we brought out caucasion neighbors here (elderly couple) who's idea of chinese food is the \"Mandarin\" and the loved it!"}
{"text":"My fav go to Dim Sum place, you better go early or late, anything in between 12-2pm and you'll be waiting on the weekends.   In general everything is fresh and delicious. I would suggest especially the egg tarts and the steamed pork bun. Egg tarts always sell out extra quick.   Tip: If you're making a trip out here I would suggest calling in advance, in some cases they shut down dim sum early or do not serve it all due to weddings. As well watch where you park, if you park in other business spots, the owners will literally come out and yell at you. If you can't find spot you can park at the lower level pit area."}
{"text":"We were here for a private dinner banquet and the food was quite good.  We had our own private section which is great!  The meal started a bit slow at the beginning but once they kicked into gear, things went quite smoothly and no long gaps between plates.  Service was quite good like normal and even our vinegar plates were constantly refilled.  Portions were generous and food quality was quite good for all dishes.  Nothing was too greasy, over/under cooked.  Let's pick at straws but our fish was not \"deboned\" too well by the server and hence a lot of fish would have gone to waste if we simply ate the plates served to us.   What is holding me back from giving them 5 stars is unrelated to the food/service, but the parking situation there.  Limited parking with MANY MANY spots reserved for the various businesses in the strip mall.  It's part of the overall experience and hence still part of the review."}
{"text":"Food is great, the line-ups are TERRIBLE - I recommend you make reservations because they will for sure make you wait for more than 2 hours if it's that busy.  It's also because they have the cheaper menu items before a certain time.  The food selection however is good and for my first dim sum experience, it was great. I would definitely recommend it.  Food: 4/5, large selection and tasty dishes too.  I've had one of the best lotus-leaf gluntonous rice and shiu mai from here.    Service: 3/5, food comes quickly but a lot of emotionless servers around who I'm sure are ok but look angry.  Ambiance: 3/5, very large area with many of the lazy susan style round tables which are great for large parties and conversations and sharing food.    Price: 3/5, It was around $20 per person for a LOT of different dishes."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite dim sum places so far. The first time I went here left in me with a very good first impression. Looking at the menu, everything sounded so delicious. Went with a few friends and we order a lot of their signature dishes there that made this place unique. The pricing for the dishes is different depending on the size of the dish. We ordered the Har Gow which was delicious and had a shrimp in the middle. Also ordered the Taro Dumpling with Quail Egg and it was quite unique. The BBQ Pork Bun with a Coconut topping was quite interesting but the flavors worked well. It was something quite different. The Fried Squid was quite delicious and I loved it because you can taste the flavor of the squid without the excessive batter. The Cha Sew was quite delicious and flavorful. To finish the meal, we ordered the Bird Cage and it was quite interesting that a Dim Sum place at a traditional tea time sort of dish. It does get quite busy on weekends and the wait times can be long. Service was great, food was great, decor and atmosphere is quite nice. Overall, I would highly recommend this dim restaurant in Richmond Hill and would go back. Perhaps, I can get that VIP Card if I keep going back a few more times!"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night with reservations for my boyfriends work party. I didn't have high expectations because it is a Chinese restaurant. We arrived around 5:30pm and it wasn't so busy until 6. The service here was amazing! They constantly changed our plates so we had a clean platter and always refilled our wine glasses. Our server was fantastic!   With the food there wasn't any dishes that were spectacular and stood out to me. We had the lobster, pig, winter melon soup, Peking duck, roasted pork, mushrooms with snow pea leaves, fried rice, fried noodle, some sort of stir fried fish and for dessert they had a few biscuits and coffee jellies with some kind of sweet flour porridge."}
{"text":"Our go-to dim sum.  Would recommend getting there early for happy hour (before 11) to enjoy almost 50% off.  But happy hour is cash only with no ATMs near by.  It is always lined up, no matter when you go.  They do not take reservations for happy hour, but will for other times.  Be ready to wait even if you make reservations.  Fabulous steamed dumplings with beautiful presentation. The spring rolls are flavourful with different textures and crispy.  Ribs with honey and lemon are great too."}
{"text":"This review is for dim sum only. I have not been here for dinner.  DO NOT come here without a reservation on a holiday. The wait time can be as long as over two hours, no exaggeration.   This place is a little fancier than your typical regular dim sum restaurant. Prices are a little more expensive too but you pay for what you get. The food quality is good and portions aren't small. Needless to say, the extra small amount you pay is worth it. They do not stinge out on ingredients. For example, the har gow has pretty large pieces of shrimp and they will add edible garnishes to the dishes like a shrimp on top of the order of har gows!  Food (Taste): 4/5 Food (Presentation): 5/5 Service: well, it's an Asian restaurant, I wouldn't count on it. Ambiance: 3/5 Price: 3/5"}
{"text":"A bit pricier than other regular dim sum places, but you get traditional dim sum dishes with some twists to them. So if you prefer classic dim sum dishes, I wouldn't recommend this place.   Nice ambience, very crowded on weekends (expect a huge lineup), OK service, nice tea (you open the package at the table on your own) All the dishes we tried were solid, but we especially enjoyed fried dough wrapped with rice roll. They sprinkled some bonito flakes on top which was a nice touch. Their deep-fried taro dim sum had a hard-boiled quail egg in the centre.   Overall, if you want to experience dim sum with some twists at a nicer place, this place will do. It still is not so pricey because our bill was about $27 (six dishes for two). We usually pay about $22 at other places for dim sum."}
{"text":"One of the top dim sum places in the GTA! The food is delicious - very contemporary way of displaying their dishes rather than the usual wooden circular shaped bowls. In the morning you have to get there right at opening (9AM I recall) and usually there is already a line outside. Half an hour after opening for breakfast, the restaurant is usually full (mind you I went on a Sunday and Monday). The dishes are a la carte so you order whatever your heart desires. The dishes are perfectly seasoned, not too salty or oily, and everything is fresh - you can tell :)! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I got to this restaurant about 5 minutes after it opened to take advantage of the early bird special. The restaurant is very popular, and every table fills up within minutes of opening. Thankfully, we were able to get the very last table available.. if we didn't, we probably would've had to wait a really long time (for a party of 5 to finish their entire meal). The parking at this place is absolutely horrible. There are only a few reserved parking spots for this restaurant, so unless you're really lucky, you're probably going to have to park pretty far away from the entrance.   Onto the food... Overall, I was content. I highly recommend the steamed seafood dumpling in soup. The dumpling was massive, and the filling was very good. The broth had a subtle flavor that tasted very fresh. The baked bbq pork bun on pastry was interesting. It was basically a mix between a pineapple bun and a bbq pork bun. The combination was a little strange to me, but I did enjoy it. The har gow and siu mai were above average in size, and they both tasted great. The deep fried shrimp balls were amazing! The deep fried crunchy texture and the shrimp ball flavor were both perfect.. I wish they gave 4 shrimp balls instead of 3 though since the order is considered a large. The deep fried durian pastry was interesting. I don't have that much experience with durian, so I really don't have anything to compare the flavor to... I thought it was okay though. The shrimp spring roll with chinese celery was probably the worst thing that we ordered. The spring roll was very overcooked in certain spots, and the flavor was underwhelming in general. I would pass on this. I also enjoyed the softly sweeten mango dumpling (but calling it a dumpling seems like a misnomer). The outside was soft and squishy, and the inside was filled with a nice and light whipped cream. I would've liked it more if the mango flavor was stronger too.  The prices were very worth it because of the early bird special (medium and large orders for the price of small), but I think it would be way too expensive if we paid full price. The service was about average, but I had no complaints since it was a full house. All in all, my dim sum experience here was very enjoyable, and I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time this morning. Since it's Saturday, there was a 20 mins line up. We tried five dishes, love them all!"}
{"text":"DIM SUM!! My parents would always bring our family to dim sum fairly often in Montreal where I am from. I was then eager to find a good dim sum place in GTA and a quick google search led me to this place.  Now let's address the 3.5 star overall review of this restaurant. The reason is the WAIT. We called at the opening to reserved a table (in cantonese too to add some legitimacy). We were confirmed for 1:30pm. We got there, and was only seated at around 2pm.   That being said, if you can bear the wait, the food is very good. Compared to the various dim sum places in Montreal, this is on another level. Their Ha Gow and Siu Mai are well formed and tasty. Granted I haven't been to China or HK to taste their dim sum, this was enough to satisfy my taste buds. Will most likely come back with my parents to let them taste what will bring to shame Montreal's dim sum places.  TDLR: LONG WAITS, GREAT FOOD"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"love having dimsum here, all the dishes are really good. This place is packed all the time, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"One of the best dimsum places I've eaten at! I had a reservation booked at like 11:15 am but still needed to wait about 15 minutes to get a seat because its super busy. The staff are really organized despite the huge lineups. Also, the interior isn't so bad either for a dimsum restaurant. The only problem I had was the chairs they had which you can BARELY slide in or out. This becomes problematic when you try to get up and go to the bathroom and the people around you have trouble moving their chairs.  The dimsum dishes on the menu didn't have a price associated with it (unless I'm blind) other than the bigger dishes like fried rice and noodles which are pretty expensive ($12+). As recommended by friends and people here, their char siu bo lo bao is a MUST TRY. It was the most delicious dish by far at any dimsum restaurant! I also really enjoyed the mango dumping (which was essentially mango mochi filled with whip cream). For savory dishes, the tripe was surprisingly very good and the sticky rice was delicious. The only thing was that the chicken feet was a little bland. The food comes out fairly fast which is pretty awesome for a full house. As mentioned by some here, when you ask for cold water, the server actually brings out a bottle of water and pours it out in front of you. At least you know its not tap water then!  Despite not knowing the price of each dish, the total came up to $56 for 5 people which is soooo cheap! I only paid $12 including tip and was completely stuffed in the end. Definitely gotta give this a try."}
{"text":"http://www.dragonboatcuisine.ca/  We came here couple times to have dinner and dim sum when we visited last Christmas.  Dim sum choices were unique and fresh.  Dinner menu were phenomenon.  Prices are reasonable.  For my mom's birthday dinner, we had all the fancy food (shark fin, abalone, bird nest soup.) The dishes were very creative and great flavor.  We had to hold my tummy when we finished our dinner.    Great decor there, it's very open and spacious and bright.  Parking can be a bit challenging in the evening.  Limited space in the front, but tons of spaces within a short walk.  (Disclosure - My uncle is the chef there and my aunt is the hostess)"}
{"text":"Came for dimsum this morning, and I really have to admit, but both their service and quality of food left a lot to be desired.   The tea was very tasteless and lukewarm at most. Service was fairly awful. We had a reservation for 12:15, arrived at 12:05 and ended up getting seated at 12:45. Quality of food definitely fell quite a bit from my last visit. In general, the food was much saltier and portions sizes seemed smaller.   Prices have also gone up. They now have items on their dimsum menu that are always full/regular price even if you come during the special times. There are no longer dimsum specials before 11am on Saturdays. Sat/Sun is now all day full/regular price: $2.99 for small, $3.99 for medium, $4.99 for large. Monday to Friday before 11am still has the $2.99 for small/medium/large special. The tea price is still $1.2 per person. I would imagine that the line-ups are no longer that crazy on Saturday mornings before they open up, although there is definitely still a long wait around noon on weekends.  Yes, they have a TV near the entrance, but the only thing it shows is a running slideshow of pictures of its own food, so no news or shows. As usual, parking is incredibly limited and there are only about a dozen or so spots close to the store front itself.  Don't think I'll be back here that soon, considering their prices and quality of food nowadays."}
{"text":"My family and I did it again! We could have ordered less dishes because portions in Canada are much bigger than those in the US! We arrived early to avoid wait time. Service was okay-most of the servers were friendly. The ones with an attitude probably had a bad morning. The food came rather quickly. The dim sum tasted delicious. This restaurant is definitely one of the best ones in the area."}
{"text":"Going for dim sum in Richmond Hill can be a daunting task if you don't speak Chinese. It's always a bit of a chaotic environment with large crowds, rushed clearing of tables, and confusing menus. But it is SO worth it because dim sum is the best invention ever. Dragon Boat is far superior to any dim sum I've had in the downtown core. Unfortunately it doesn't have the ladies walking around with carts, but that's a minor downside. The quality of the har gow, crispy chow mein, radish cake, sticky rice, steamed custard buns, short rib, and rice rolls was excellent. Reasonable price in my opinion. The woman at the front who was taking names down was very friendly and helpful. They don't take reservations and I waited for about 20 minutes on a Saturday around noon, for a table for 5."}
{"text":"Severely understaffed and staff who are actually there makes unforgivable mistakes. Will not visit again. The only redeeming factor is corkage is $10, or free, depending on whether the server remembers you opened a bottle of wine or not."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum spots and Chinese restaurants in the city. I have been coming here for many years, and I always come here when I have friends and family visiting, including from Hong Kong. Some of their dishes are unique and can't be found at other dim sum spots. Their dinner dishes are also great!"}
{"text":"For the love of dim sum and good service.. I fully recommend Dragon Boat...there is always a lineup here for dim sum mornings on weekends...and NO RESERVATIONS before 11am...boo...   The food, ambience, service is something I've not been disappointed here every single time...yea I know they might be a bit on the pricey side but you gotta trust me on this one..the food is 85% consistent in quality which is surprisingly high for a Chinese restaurant...   The servers are quite attentive which won my service star... Lol...I like the way the food is presented...no in the traditional circular steam containers..love the shrimp dumplings there cuz the shrimp piece is bigger than other places for  sure...   All in all, my first choice for dim sum.."}
{"text":"Finally a place that combines amazing ambiance, great service, reasonable prices with good food. Minus 1 star because the har gow wrapping was too thick; all other dishes were made perfectly and packed with flavour. The food was also extremely well presented. We had a really enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I go here every other weekend for dim sum with the family (sometimes every weekend). The food is great. They have a lot of dim sum items that is not often found in other dim sum restaurants. They work on a menu card where you check off what you want and they bring it to you rather than waiting for delivery carts to arrive at your table like a lot of the dim sum restaurants out there and when they finally arrive, they're out of food!   The price is somewhat on the higher side compared to some others in the area but I think it's well worth it. You can even get a VIP card which gives you 10% off the bill. The tea they serve is pretty good. Their shrimp \"har gow\" doesn't have the black poop, as I call it in the shrimps. The place itself looks clean although I would highly recommend anyone going here to clean their bowls and cups with tea as I always find some dirt in them.   Highly recommend for anyone who wants to try delicious dim sum with friends or family. Their duck egg yolk bun (forgot the actual name) is a MUST try in my opinion. Going here for Chinese New Year's dinner. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for dimum. OMG we should have came earlier. We arrived at 11am and we didnt get seated till 1pm ....OMGGG  Food was fine. We have been here many times. I am just hoping they can do something about this wait time. I cant believe they are still taking reservations for dimsum on the weekends. My opinion it should be first come first serve for the weekend dimsum.   And I also feel like if you know the host lady Judy you can get seated faster than normal people like us who waited 2 hrs..by the time we got our table I wasnt even hungry anymore.   If you wanna try this place for dimsum on a weekend. I strongly recommend you go super early when they first open or go after 1:30pm."}
{"text":"Omg. Ok so I live in the Greater Philadelphia area so Dim Sum at its best is probably the worst Toronto has to offer. I haven't had Dim Sum like this in over 10 years. You Ontario people are so lucky!  Even their regular Peking duck with Mei fun is beautiful with a heated plate! Their Shu Mei was insane and har gow was served with a plump and fresh shrimp! Everything was above my expectation. The beauty of it is that there are no carts, you just order what you want on a beautiful menu and your food will come to your table piping hot! I was always one of those people who thought carts are a must at dim sum. I guess Dragon boats converted me. I am book marking this place as a must return the next time I come back for dim sum in Richmond Hill.   The only downside of my meal is that I only went with my husband and a 22 month old child. I ordered as if I had 6 people at my table. I ended up in food coma and wasted a lot of food as I didn't have a place to keep the food cold in my car or heat up the food at my hotel.    Highly recommend getting the egg custard tart, Shu Mei, har gow, deep fried sticky pork dumpling, Peking duck with mei fun.   I can't wait to come back here the next time I'm in town...which could be a few years so the food coma was worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best places for Dimsum. They have an early bird special. Definitely come early, it is always packed 7 days a week. I sit and wonder \"dont these ppl have jobs?\" then i look and myself and just continue eating.   Desserts are good,  order the almond green tea cake and egg tarts. I love milk egg tarts.   Their siu mai is the best ive ever had in my life. The other popular hai gao (excuse my spelling) shrimp dumplings is just okay. I taste the cheapness and fishiness in the shrimp. Bleh   All their rice noodle rolls are amazing. I always thought ordering Beef rice noodle roll was a weird thing to do but my Caucasian friend ordered their angus beef roll and it was delicious.   Something important is PARKING . PARKING is impossible to find in front of the restaurant because the plaza it's in allocates spots for certain shops. So you park in a reserved spot for a different business a chinese man will come out of the bush and tell you to move LMFAO. Park in the keg's parking lot and walk up the hill is my suggestion.   Service is quick and friendly. Only the hostess is kind of...... uh not so nice & professional person. You gotta be assertive with her and watch out for your number. She almost skipped me and I was right there!! I know my numbers in chinese but it doesnt come naturally for me so it is easier if i hear the numbers in english. She gets lazy and doesnt read it in english and skipped me. Luckily I was right there and i saw her go to the next number so i stopped her and we got seated. Happened a few times already. Quite frustrating. Everyone else and the food makes up for this so 4stars it is."}
{"text":"Wow.... the variety... so many choices... Most of the choices we had were awesome... the rest were pretty good :) I have no idea what everything was called, just pick random items that sound like you might enjoy.  Out of six items you might get one you're not crazy about... unless of course you know what you're getting, then you'll enjoy everything :)  I went here with visitors from Montreal and they loved this place... definitely coming back... great for groups and newbies..."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday dim sum. Was told the wait is 30 minutes but ended up waiting for 1:30 minutes. Everyone was told the wait is 30 minutes while at least 1 hour is the minimum. At the same time they gave away tables to their friends before normal customers. If they told me the wait is an hour I would have gone somewhere else. They lie to keep you waiting around."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from the west end to try this place for dinner upon my mom's friend's recommendation.  They were fully booked for the night and we didn't have a reservation, but after a bit of a wait, they managed to fit our group of six in. The food was definitely worth the wait. We ordered fish maw soup, fresh bass two ways, snow pea shoots in a conpoy soup, free range steamed chicken and cantonese style pork chops.  All of these are items that can be found at any Cantonese restaurant, but Dragon Boat goes above and beyond with their attention to detail and luxury. The soup included fish roe which I've never seen at any other restaurant.  The pork was very tender and seamed to be braised before being fried.  It was a premium cut of meat. Most Chinese restaurants buy the cheap cuts and try to hide the fact by soaking it in meat tenderizer. The staff was also very attentive, replacing your plate with a clean one every few minutes. Finally, the complimentary dessert consisted of a trio of items - A peanut cookie, a mango pudding cube, and white fungus sweet soup.  Usually, I'm not a big fan of the white fungus dessert soup.  It usually doesn't have much flavour other than sugar and some sort of squash or melon. This one however was loaded with lotus seeds and longan, giving it a much more complex and satisfying flavour.  Overall, this restaurant is a bit pricier than the average Chinese restaurant, but the quality is well worth the price. I look forward to returning here again."}
{"text":"Dragon Boat Fusion is definitely worth all the hype. Only downside is the wait time - got here on a Sunday at 11:30am - and didnt get in until almost 1pm. Although after the wait, everything else was smooth sailing. The dim sum dishes were delicious, offering traditional dim dishes and a few fusion. We ordered roughly 15 dishes, and amongst the 8 of us, we ended up paying ~$20. Super impressed with this place, but will definitely come back on a weekday."}
{"text":"Not recommended, extra charge tea 15$ for 5 people, over charge food that we didn't order, hv to carefully b4 pay."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most well-known dim sum places in Richmond Hill with insane lines and delicious food but sadly my most recent here was just meh. I've came here many times for celebrations and had those 10 course meals but in my most recent visit, the food didn't taste as good as it used to and it was very salty. I still like to come here for dim sum but the downside of it is the insanely long line ups and it's only best when to come here with hook ups to the people who work here."}
{"text":"Here's an update to the review after trying the dim sum at this place.  The dim sum selection here is alright.  One thing I can probably say is that they don't really have that crazy of a selection.  Here's a list of what I had and what I thought.   - Dough fritters w/ XO sauce (AMAZING, super fresh with a little twist) - Vegetable and shrimp dumplings (AMAZING),  - Haw gow shrimp dumplings (MEH, kinda average),  - Egg yolk buns (Average) - Beef brisket w/ turnip (very good, watch out for the dipping sauce... HOT) - dried mussel and vegetable congee (Average)  The thing that really stood out is the BBQ duck.  I mean, it's amazing, best I've ever had.  The meat of the duck is seasoned all the way through and then the skin is really crispy (think peking duck).  If you ever go here, trust me... order the BBQ duck."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weeknight - it was surprisingly very packed! Good thing we made reservations beforehand! I think the kitchen staff wasn't expecting that many people because our food took a while to come out.   ROASTED PORK & JELLYFISH 3/5 Roasted pork skin was very crunchy - I don't usually like roasted pork but I thought they did a good job with this dish.  GEODUCK (sashimi geoduck and/or geoduck cooked in broth) 5/5 Omgosh.. a-m-a-z-i-n-g! We had geoduck at another Chinese restaurant before - they didn't slice the geoduck thin enough. The way they sliced it up here was perfect :) Can be eaten as sashimi with wasabi and soy sauce or can be cooked in hot broth, dipped with spicy soy sauce. Both were delicious! Personally, I preferred the cooked version more. We were all saying how yummy it was while nomming this - goldstars.. goldstars..!! Will definitely come back for more of this.  SALTED EGG YOLK BATTERED GEODUCK & ASPARAGUS 4.5/5 I believe it is the shell part of the geoduck that was cooked in the salted egg yolk batter for this dish. Very delicious!  SEA CUCUMBER with SHRIMP 4/5 Love the sea cucumber! It was very chewy and retained it's original flavour despite the sauces that were poured over it.  BRAISED RIB STEAK 5/5 The sauce is sooo good! The meat was very tender and juicy - soaked all the flavour in!   DESSERTS - RED BEAN SWEET SOUP, MANGO PUDDING & ALMOND COOKIES 3/5 I really liked the almond cookies because they heat it up before serving - mango pudding was also delicious."}
{"text":"For a dim sum obsessed person, this place is a must. Parking wasn't as bad as I thought since I read reviews ahead of time about this. We parked in the back. If people are worried about parking, they can also park in the plaza next to them (a further walk), but worth it.  Got here at 10:15am. Despite not having a special price on the weekends, there were a huge line up. We waited 45 minutes (as the hostess predicted) for a table of 8. Good thing was we got the menu to look at before we got seated so we saw what we wanted to order.  Prices are on par with other high end dim sum places like Premier Ballroom & Convention Centre & Royale Fine Dining.   S: $2.90 M: $3.90 L: $4.90 XL: $5.90 SP: $6.90  *Monday to Fridays (excluding holidays), dim sum (S,M,L) are all $2.90 each before 11am.  My fave dishes were: Baked bbq pork pun pastry (bbq pork filled all the way through), siu mai, steamed spare ribs with taro (taro was a nice touch), steamed egg yolk cream bun, steamed angus beef rice rolls (used strips of beef instead of grounded beef - so soothe and delicious), steamed avocado & eel rice rolls (very unique and good tasting! didn't even need soya sauce),  baked milk egg tart (AMAZEBALLS - so creamy), and the deep fried durian pastry puff (for durian fans, this was good!).  Some dishes that I did not like and would not order again: Steamed rice roll with fried dough - it had bonita flakes, which made it pretty fancy, but the dough fritter was too crunchy. They should take it out earlier from the deep fryer. The deep fried sesame balls with date paste - for date lovers, this is for you. Full of date flavour, but I didn't like it and would have preferred the original instead.   They really did not skim on the ingredients. They filled each dim sum to the brim like the har gow - used the entire shrimp to make it and gave an extra shrimp with the head!  This is definitely a good place to try different types of \"fusion\" dim sums, but it's definitely a lot pricer than other regular dim sum places. Reservations are available after 11:00am, but the hostess told us we would still have to wait when I called earlier in the week to inquire  - so basically this is a moot point."}
{"text":"My favorite dim sum place in Toronto. However this place is impossible to get in even with reservations. So unless you don't mind waiting you have to either be there super early or near the end. Dim sum has a twist not just your typical dim sum. BBQ pork is not as good as Skyview. Sizes were bigger than other dim sum places, food tasted good and the service was great for a Chinese restaurant. Few Servers dropped by to chat and the teas was always topped up."}
{"text":"The problem here is the parking.  People will have to drive a whole circle around the plaza to get to the front of the restaurant.  As one gets to the front, one will realize that all the spots in the plaza are reserved for other units.  Very frustrating.  The smart approach is to park in the middle in the general parking area (shared with other plazas) and avoid driving a circle around the plaza."}
{"text":"Good dim sum spot uptown. 3 stars due to the lack of parking, long wait and pricey menu items. The food is tasty but the lack of parking and long wait really takes away from the experience!"}
{"text":"Went here last night. Nice atmosphere, clean, very busy restaurant. Get there early or you may need to wait. The service was great and fast which is a standard at Asian restaurants. Food was a cut above other Asian restaurants. Great for seafood. Plenty of special dishes and options here.  I would say that this is one of the better Chinese restaurants in Richmond Hill.  They are very good for their dim sum as well. Go before 10 am for 2.90 per plate on weekdays. Excellent option for breakfast."}
{"text":"The dim sum here is on the pricey side, but it is superb. There is a wide selection and everything is good taste and quality.   Special mentions: (Recently changed management and food even better)  Dan Dan Noodle - the BEST! peanut buttery soup, excellent noodles  BBQ Pork Pineapple Bun  Fish soup noodles  ---   Egg Yolk Bun  - good balance of sweetness. The filling does come out, but it's not watery; the consistency is sandy/mashed up yolk.   Tofu dessert - really smooth!  The honeycomb beef (beef stomach and daikon?)  is a bit tough to chew.  Good for groups! Very presentable, comfortable chairs and bright interior."}
{"text":"Came here for late dinner and this place was still packed, and while their dishes do taste and look different, I don't quite get the hype. From the few things left that were still available to order that late, (most menu items were abalone or sea cucumber, etc, which we didn't want), we got a roast duck, which was really flavourful, and the braised beef with red wine, which I thought was really unpleasant (it was trying too hard to combine east and west and ended up tasting like chocolate beef...). Maybe I have a biased view from the few things I ordered, but I won't be coming back here for a while. I must say that their customer service (once you sit down) is quite good, and I'm a huge fan of their complimentary desserts."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars, but I felt horrible For the fish in the tanks. It's a little inhumane how they are treated... also, since I don't read Chinese, praying they don't have shark fin.  other than that, outstanding dim sum and not full of msg and salt like other places."}
{"text":"Concluding a long day of shopping, we arrived at Dragon Boat for dinner. I came with high expectations after hearing about the special BBQ pork. We were quickly seated at the table.   After a confusion of bolay tea from the waiter/waitress, we ordered sweet and sour pork, BBQ Pork and Fried Pig (not sure of the name in english), broccoli and tofu, and a dish with fish and scallops.  The food was disapointing. The BBQ Pork was average and did not impress. My favourite dish sweet and sour pork was bland and had blueberries in it (personal preference). However, the broccoli tasted good. Overall, the food was below expectations.  Dragon Boat disappointed me. Hearing rave reviews of the special BBQ Pork, the pork was average. I would not return. I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, Jen W. and her family decided to try a famed Chinese restaurant, far far away, in hopes of experiencing whatever rare delicacies come from a four-starred Chinese restaurant. Hopes were high, appetites whetted, yet all that was served were confusion and disappointment.   Dear friends, tonight I discovered that there are many more toppings that should be served with Peking Duck. Like: - marshmallows  - grapes - melon - cherry tomatoes - raisins - oranges - disappointment  - regret  - frustration (All mentioned actually served)  In addition, I also discovered that the Canadian dollar has plummeted oh so drastically that this fine establishment was forced to charge their customers 7 dollars for 8 pieces of lettuce. Oh wait, 8 pieces of lettuce that failed to make it to our table!   Also, one must be prepared to wait 10-20 minutes for service and then 10-20 minutes more for whatever it is you have asked for.   And we lived happily ever after. Not.  FOOD ordered (and rating out of 5): - soup of the day (3/5) - sautéed scallops with zucchini and mushrooms (3/5) - Peking duck (3/5) - Braised Ribs, Chiu Chow Style (3.5/5) - Boiled Free Range Chicken (1/5) - Steamed Live Fish (1/5)"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday morning, and sadly it was super crowded. Luckily (for me), a friend of mine had been waiting for a table a while (maybe an hour) before we got there, so we only had to wait 15-25 minutes to get seated.   I let my friend order for the three of us, and every dish was amazing.   Fun experience at this place though: I ordered plain congee thinking that it would be good, and when it turned out not to be what I had in mind, I put some soy sauce into my congee. Turns out this is not a normal occurence because the server came up to me to point this out.   I also left my purse on my seat and the very annoyed, but endearing waiter shoved past the waiting customers to get to me yelling, \"OH MY GOD\". Will definitely return when we're in town."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner, had a horrible experience . We ordered 2 lobsters. The waiter was kind enough to fish them out of the tank and present it to us before cooking it.  Eventually, the lobster was served. The plate was garnished and looked great. Too bad its all a sham. Most of the shells were empty. The meats texture had a powdery sensation. Anyone could tell that this lobster wasn't the same live fresh ones they showed us earlier. Live lobster should have a natural bouncy texture. We made a complaint sending the dish back to the kitchen.   They weighed us another lobster which was slightly heavier and the manager still charged us for it. This mistake was their bad, as a customer, we should not have to pay for their mistake. 200$ for a plate of frozen lobster. I feel bad for others who frequent this place.  Aside from hating on the lobster, we had ordered 8 other dishes. I wouldn't give anything else higher than 2/10 rating. Sweet and sour pork, usually this dish is made with real pork. These guys used pig lard, fried in batter. There was no meat. The boiled vegetables were drenched in oil.   This place needs to work on their customer service and food quality control.   Overall dinner that night, bill came up to around 450$, I'd give the food a 1.5/10. Customer service 2/10. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Sunday morning. Arrived at 10:30 craving dim sum.  Minimum 45 min wait. Poor system of organization - in fact they were only calling numbers out in Chinese.   Was seated eventually and came to realize this place is huge. Service for probably 200 people.   Had a look at the menu and picked our faves. The menu is pretty clear cut - informing you of what you're going to eat - whether it be pork, beef, vegetable, shrimp or fish.   We order the vegetarian turnip pancake - described as a vegetarian dish. The dish ended up having pork in it. The waiter agreed to take it back and not charge us but did say that we should've asked if it had pork in it. I disagree with his comments because every other dish we were served reflected the description A so maybe they just need to update that. To be honest - I did try a piece being a pork eater myself and found it to be quite delicious.   Har Gow was spot on. In fact larger than usual. The noodles were steamed perfectly and the Abdin dance of shrimp packed inside that rice noodle was great. Surprisingly - they had ready on the table the mustard/siracha combination dip - which in many other places you have to beg for.   Sui Mai - was also great. Larger than usual portion with superior quality.   The steamed filet mignon was on of my favourites. Usually they have steamed ribs with black pepper sauce but this place uses good quality meat as a substitute.   Other dishes we enjoyed was a har gow style dish bit with an almond crust on the exterior and shrimp stuffed inside. Absolutely delicious.   For how busy it was, the service was great but like most dim sum places you have to take control.   All in all, I had a great experience but it was that one comment from the waiter that upset me. If every other dish explained what meat was in a dish then why didn't the one we order? Instead of being instructed to ask him what meat each dish contained - wouldn't it be simpler if they just included the word pork in the description of the turnip pancake so that everyone else could benefit?  I'd definitely return but that line up (when you're hungry) is just painful...."}
{"text":"little pricey and long wait times since this place is sooo hyped up and popular. it lives up to its rep for the most part. i like their desserts (hubby loves their durian pastries, says they're the best anywhere!) and their soy mai are giant and funny with the prawn sticking out of the box, but i do find it a little weird having a long chewy steam/leaf/veggie running through the \"angus beef rice roll\". maybe a little too fusion for me lol but besides that dumplings are delicious and food is hot and fresh, service is as expected anywhere in richmond hill and markham, sloppy and irritating but super fast and very efficient"}
{"text":"Best dim sum in Toronto. The value and the quality both exceed my expectations. Long line everyday proves that everyone love it. Due to this is abuse restaurant, the service is a different story. If you just enjoy the food you will be fine just ignore the rests"}
{"text":"Haven't thought of writing a review after until I've tried their \"crab meat and egg white with noodle in pumpkin soup\".  There is \"real\" crab meat and it is the only restaurant that serves this noodle.  It came in a big plate and was in big portion.  It is good for six to eight people.  This noodle is listed in the dim sum menu.  This is a must try  : ) The rice noodle of this place is also unique coz it comes with a jar of \"warm\" soy sauce. Most of the restaurant will come with a jar of soy sauce, but this is the only restaurant that comes in warm."}
{"text":"Wait is too long. Dim sum is alright. Service better than most dim sum places but still isn't excellent."}
{"text":"Lineup was terrible. Food isn't that great and definitely not worth the price. Service is completely terrible. Definitely not coming back again."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with family and ordered several dishes including a 6lb lobster, fish, peking duck, chicken and soup.  +++Exception service and the cutlery is definitely something special for Chinese restaurants ++Food was delicious and ingredients were fresh ++Price is very reasonable in comparison to other restaurants serving the same dishes - The super large plates that the food comes in looks great in presentation, but the small tables make it clunky and difficult to place multiple dishes on the table without it limiting eating space --Seating was somewhat cramped and the sheer number of people waiting for tables spill into the restaurant itself   Make sure you call in before hand to book a table or it'll be kinda difficult to eat here"}
{"text":"I have heard that Dragon Boat is a good restaurant; I have also heard that it is expensive, so I have never stepped foot in here.  Well, both statements are correct.    I came to Dragon Boat for dim sum lunch during Chinese New Year weekend.  As expected, the restaurant was swamped.  After we got our table, we ordered 5 dim sums to share.     - The haw gow was pretty to look at and tasted delicious.  The shrimp inside was fresh and bouncy to the bite.   - The BBQ rice rolls were my favourite: the rice skin was thin and almost transparent, and there were a lot of quality BBQ pork bits in the middle.   - The durian pastry puffs were very fragrant, or smelly depending on your preference of smell.  The paste inside the pastry was very soft and creamy, with a hint of sweetness.  I noted that the durian fragrance remained on my breathe for a few hours after lunch.  Be forewarned.   - The deep fried sticky pork dumplings were the best I have had.  I don't usually like this dish, but Dragon Boat's version was not oily or greasy.  The skin was crispy and very sweet.  The pork bits inside was salty and juicy.  The combination of crispness and softness, sweet and savory, was an assault to my sensation.   - The steamed mixed vegetable and fresh mushroom rolls were big in portion and rich in taste.  It was the weakest of the 5 dim sums, but it held its own merits being the only healthy (steamed not fried) vegetarian dim sum of the day.  Services were very fast.  The dim sum at Dragon Boat is good.  It is not cheap but it is not the most expensive neither.  I think you do get the value that you pay for in this case.    Overall, 4 stars.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that, self-proclaimed as serving fusion cuisine, the \"fusion\" aspect or innovative aspect is lacking.  It may be more evident in dinner dishes. However, I don't think I have the financial budget to validate it.  I hope other Yelpers could review that."}
{"text":"Long long lines especially on the weekends. Definitely worth waiting one hour for. A lot of authentic dishes. My daughter loved the bo lo bao with roasted pork inside. I loved the egg white Dan tart. My husband loved the fried squid"}
{"text":"1 star for the service and attitude of the staff, 3 stars for the food.  I've been to this restaurant many times before and it gets worse every visit! 2 weeks ago I walked in for dim sum lunch at 1pm, waited for an hour before getting a table (lesson learnt). We were also warned that regardless if we order tea or not we'd still get charged for tea.   Fast forward to yesterday morning. I had called the afternoon before to reserve a table for 6, it was my aunt's birthday dim sum lunch. Upon arriving at the restaurant the hostess said they never got my reservation. There's no indication that I called to rsvp, and she *with all the attitude one could exert* \"couldn't do anything about it\". I was furious! What kind of service is this? So, I proceeded to show her my phone records clearly stating that the night before I had called the restaurant and had a 40 second conversation with a staff member making the reservation. At this point, she was pretty annoyed and reluctantly said \"okay I'll put your name down\". It wasn't until maybe 10 mins later that we were sat.  Like I said, the staff here don't care about you or anything else. The food is good compared to a lot of other places but based on these bad experiences I won't be coming back. It also doesn't look like they'll ever change their reservation process due to the popularity of the restaurant and the lack of care they have towards customer service."}
{"text":"The food definitely makes up for the long lineup everyday. Their selection of dim sum is quite unique and they have so interesting choices on their menu. The food was pretty good and we didn't wait a long time to get our order. However, the restaurant is pretty small inside and the wait is agonizing, so make sure to come early or come on weekdays."}
{"text":"Host for dim sum didn't follow the number system.  Food was ok, presentation was nice but for me it lacked flavour."}
{"text":"We brought non-Asian friends to dine at Dragon Boat.  We enjoyed their Peking Duck and pepper beef.  The other dishes were just OK.  The service was beyond my expectations-- service at a Chinese restaurant is typically not good."}
{"text":"Best seafood dinner ever! Our group ordered the nine pounds spider crab three way. oh my goodness, claws steams with garlic, fresh sweet chunk white meat, so delicious! Second way ginger and scallion. Third was steam egg with the crab roe. I can eat that all day long.  For the price of $48CAD a pound times nine, sounds like a lot, but was worth every dollar!  All the other dishes was equally delicious! Service was  so so, they were so busy, it was on a Saturday and the place was packed. The wait staff looks over worked and tired. Maybe on a weekday night would be better. But food is good enough for this to be overlooked. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"really good dimsum ?traditional food are tasty,and there is something special with creation"}
{"text":"Pretty happy with the quality of food here but prices are a bit higher here. $2.80 small $3.80 medium $4.80 large $5.80 extra large  Of course they have the early bird special before 11am where small to large are $2.80  Everything tasted great especially the egg yolk custard bun. The place was still busy on a weekday afternoon after 11am. I thought there would be no line up after 11am since the price increase but it was still busy. I still give a slight edge to my favorite Fansy Chinese Cuisine because they have the best tofu dessert."}
{"text":"Great dim sum. Large portions and very authentic.   Atmosphere felt just like any dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong.  Reception lady was not the greatest, but waiters and waitresses were very helpful.  I would definitely come back and recommend this restaurant for dim sum."}
{"text":"I've tried both dinner and lunch here and both times it was ok. I just had dim sum, so I'll focus more on my recent experience.  Staff: They were very accommodating when we saw another table open up and asked to be moved (our original table was right at the entrance and very cold and drafty). Sadly, it was near impossible to get their attention when we wanted to place our order, or pay the bill. I noticed some tables constantly got extra services (seemed like regulars). I wish they had paid more attention to us, as we had asked to pay the bill 4 times and each time they acknowledged saying they'd be right back but never came.  Ambience: It is as loud but not as bad as some other dim sum locations. The chairs are comfy but the tables had these bars running across the legs and was obstructing me from sitting comfortably. And at one point my elbow hit the corner of the table, even though it was round! It's so odd to have corners on a round table.  Food: These were definitely some of the best plating I've seen for dim sum. They also had some dishes I've never seen on their menu like we had Deep Fried Taro Meat Dumplings but they were topped with Quail Eggs. Unfortunately, the flavours were just ok. Some seemed too salty and greasy for my liking.  It was not as special as I'd hoped. Their WiFi also wasn't working and their parking lot are full of designated spots for other units so you have to go to the far back for unmarked spots. However, their unique menu and presentation intrigues me enough to get me to return in the future."}
{"text":"\"This is what dim sum was like in the 80s. We are saving like $5 by coming now - not worth it. I am going to have to stand at the front to hear our number. Well priced and good food - but a bad place if you are retired and on a fixed income and you go on a weekday.\"  We targeted a 9AM Friday arrival since we had to be up early and had the day off. Minor emergency and we landed there at 10AM instead. Because we were only two, the wait was projected at 30 mins and actual was 45 mins. We had filled out the dim sum order form and handed it over as we were seated. 30 minutes later our dishes arrived en masse rather than gradually.  We had Cha Siu Cheng Fon - looked average but there was a lot of tasty cha siu inside the silky noodles Siu Mai - Delicious staple Ham Siu Gok - these are nicknamed dinosaur eggs in our family. They made a good version of these sweet, rounded, chewy pork dumplings Dough Fritter Cheung Fon - Different, more savory with bonito flakes on top. My husband liked this more than others. Almond crusted shrimp balls - much like the outside shell of a crab claw, this was ground up deep fried shrimp. I loved how they crusted the outside with sliced almonds. This is their own unique dish and it was my favourite.  Service I would say was average. When clearing a dirty serving dish from our table, the person stacked someone else's dirty dish on top of it right on our table. They asked us if our teapot needed refilling (cap was up for a while) when we were clearly finished with wallet out on the table."}
{"text":"I wasn't too sure about this place being fusion style, but it wasn't too bad at all. I am pretty traditional though when it comes to food like this so I stuck with what I knew.  The short ribs were spot on, but the other items were pretty par for the course.   I think this place would probably be better for dinner or lunch, dim sum and fusion don't quiet go together."}
{"text":"The Chinese food in the Greater Toronto Area reigns supreme in terms of taste & authenticity, due to the huge influx of Chinese immigrants when China took over Hong Kong in 1997. W/ so many Chinese restaurants to choose from, Yelp reviews were very helpful.  I love good dim sum, & fellow GTA Yelpers Wayne C. & Jennifer K. recommended Dragon Boat Fusion Cuisine. Their excellent dim sum were very fresh, flavorful, served piping hot, & authentic by Hong Kong standards. Food presentation is 1st class. No push carts here, w/ the growing trend to order from a menu to keep the dim sum hot.  We went there twice & had the following:  - Baked BBQ pork bun (char siu bao). A little different here than in HI, w/ a sweet yellow glaze on top. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-boat-fusion-cuisine-richmond-hill?select=9b7OwLZAK4DMTNq5KCXKaw   - Steamed shrimp dumpling (har gow). Perfect in all aspects & served w/ a huge prawn. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-boat-fusion-cuisine-richmond-hill?select=OkXg1qIe8OC5_AGeHO6zHA   - Steamed pork dumpling (siu mai). Topped w/ crunchy orange fish roe. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-boat-fusion-cuisine-richmond-hill?select=GkNLD7JmwoaYADZJ_mQ4GQ   - Deep fried taro w/ bird's egg. Cute little egg in a \"nest\" that was delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-boat-fusion-cuisine-richmond-hill?select=RJ8smnmHNUSQVWFQIjU4Fg   - Pan fried beef ribs in honey & lemon sauce. Awesome marinade! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-boat-fusion-cuisine-richmond-hill?select=UHJFl4MiywwIYD-yDFSEyw   - Deep fried shrimp ball. Stellar, as it's served hot & crunchy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-boat-fusion-cuisine-richmond-hill?select=gSJ8YEqzKbVgNh4Faq1tMA   - BBQ pork rice rolls (cheong fun).  My favorite - full of char siu & served w/ a small pitcher of pour-your-own sauce. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-boat-fusion-cuisine-richmond-hill?select=Jx6NfBqDHqvxeI3sxuVQLA   - Deep fried durian pastry puff. An acquired taste, my son loved it, & I defer to him (although I liked the flaky pastry). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-boat-fusion-cuisine-richmond-hill?select=tE5t1smjWG5m2I-k_vOE7g   - Deep fried sesame ball w/ black sesame. Similar to jin dui, but filled with a delicious creamy black sesame sauce that oozed out as you bit into it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-boat-fusion-cuisine-richmond-hill?select=947soD81XJh97SZ0FTEQQA   -  BBQ duck w/ noodles in soup. Best roast duck I've ever had w/ the skin so crispy w/ freshly cooked gai lan, & served over a sterno flame; soup broth was super tasty.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-boat-fusion-cuisine-richmond-hill?select=KU7tELUpSIY9H55VfIXjJg   Fine china is used for the tea & serving plates for the dim sum.  There are 2 teapots:  1 for the tea, and 1 for hot water; when the teapot w/ the tea runs out, just pour the hot water in to make more tea.  Regular prices for the dim sum are $2.80 small, $3.80 medium, $4.80 large, & $5.80 extra large; however, if ordered before 11 am, all S, M, & L plates are $2.80 (a bargain).  Although the restaurant takes credit card charges, the dim sum morning specials are cash only. They also have terrific lunch specials & exquisite dinner items, which we hope to experience the next time. Other than the specials, dishes are a little pricy, but well worth it.  The restaurant was packed w/ Chinese nationals & more waiting in line. We knew this was a great place for dim sum, just by how crowded it was. We were given a number written on a piece of paper on a first-come, first-served basis by the hostess, which she noted on her list + the number of people. She would rattle in Chinese these numbers, & if you weren't fast enough, you would be quickly bypassed. I intentionally stood near her & showed my number when she crossed off that same number on her list - that worked for us when we couldn't understand her rattling in Chinese. Both times, we waited for about  1/2 hour. Menus are in English & Chinese, so no need to worry if you can't speak Chinese. Considering the large size of the restaurant, service was adequate.  Established in 1999 in Toronto, this restaurant holds 200+ people for a banquet party. Many wedding, anniversary, & birthday parties are held here. Interior is clean, bright, & elegant w/ comfortable chairs w/ gold chair covers. In addition to the men's and women's bathrooms (aka \"washrooms\" in Canada); there is also a bridal room; that tells you the many wedding receptions that are held here. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-boat-fusion-cuisine-richmond-hill?select=tSN4uigvPDP9CSG7A7qnVw   Located in an area w/other businesses, the restaurant exterior is nondescript. Many spaces closest to the restaurant are reserved for other shop owners, but there is a huge parking lot at the lower level. Restaurant is located in the Richmond Hill area, near the intersection of Hwy 404 & Hwy 7.   A winner for sure!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Oh boy.  Today was the first time I visited here in about two years (I haven't been near here for a long time), and I must say service standards have sank quite a bit.  First of all, someone misplaced our reservation of peking duck, so we ended up not having it as they ran out. Second, one of the waitresses recommended the scallops since they came in fresh, but upon ordering one for each (six), she came out about 10 minutes later and said there were only three remaining....gee thanks. Thirdly, our whole initial order got lost in the system due to a \"computer error\", so we had to have our order taken down twice.  The food, however, is still excellent, and I will still come back regardless. However, they really do need to improve the service and organization there, because my experience tonight compared to my experience 2-3 years ago have been two completely different ones."}
{"text":"Brought a whole table full of visiting Sri Lankan grand-folk with me to the table on a weekday morning.  We ordered and were served in due time.    The dimsum was pretty amazing.  Everyone was satisfied even the pickiest of eaters.  The waiters kept bringing us more and more hot sauce (I wonder that they didn't just leave the squeeze bottle).    Overall, a very satisfying experience and we have since been back!"}
{"text":"Service is bad. Too much MSG in food. Portion is small. There are many better Chinese restaurants in Richmond Hill and Markham. There is no reason to come to this one."}
{"text":"Their food is way better than ones in America, the prices is better than those in America, but my appetite is sunken to the drain by the horrible attitude of the reception. The reception is very bias and very communist. They give out numbers but don't go by the order and often with their favorite guests. If you decide to go with 4 or less people, prepare to wait for an hour or two, because they'll never call on you until you complain or if the customers goes low."}
{"text":"This is my go to dim sum place! Like any asian dim sum place, so expect it to be rowdy and cluttered. It's a really busy place and sometimes you have to wait 30min - 1hr for a spot, so I do recommend coming as early as possible to get a spot. If you're an early bird, they also have cheaper prices in the morning versus afternoon.   Their portions are reasonable, but I what I like this place is that they actually give you your money's worth. For example, normal dim sum places give you small yet battered shrimp dumplings (ha gao/xiao jiao). But dragon fusion not only gives you big ones, but also real shrimp in their filling.   My favourite is the fried durian dessert (if you're a fan of durian at least)!"}
{"text":"Best dim sum in the planet earth, we are do addicted to lunch in here, food has a great taste and presentation and great quality"}
{"text":"First off the parking here sucks ass....u can't park at the bottom because you will get ticketed since this business is not apart of that parking lot, the rest of the parking in this shit plaza is like 80% reserved for other businesses so good luck getting parking on a weekend yet alone on a holiday......  We waited 20mins and we noticed ppl who came after us got seated before us and this happened at least 3 times which I guess is because they knew the workers there...also saw some people give the workers red pockets......anyways the food was pretty good here, pricy but worth it, the BBQ pork rice is a must try, it's not on the menu so u have to tell the waiter  Service here kind of sucks, I see the waiters and waitress mainly serving the customers whom they know compared to us, will come back but I rather come with my mom next time since she knows the manager here so we can get a quicker seat and free tea lol"}
{"text":"One of Richmond Hill's finest in Chinese fine dining. Stand outs are the Peking Duck, geoduk (sashimi style), sweet & sour pork, bitter melon w/duck, and fried squid tentacles. Service is top notch. But try to get there early or it will be packed at peak dinner times. Parking lot is small and confusing."}
{"text":"Dim sum is worth waiting in line for! The service is excellent consider how busy they are. The volume speaks of the quality of the food there. Steamed Seafood & pork dumpling with lotus roots stands out, wrapped up in thin layer of seaweed. Compact seafood flavour! Steamed BBQ Pork Rice Rolls, must try!!! Think they really perfect the rice rolls, with its nice bounce and silkiness. Also the Steamed Shrimp Dumpling ( Had Gow ) has the same texture. All the seafood they use in the dishes are indeed fresh. Deep fried octopus tentacle is just okay a bit tough in regarding to the texture. The mustard green with clam & preserved egg congee serves as a good finishing touch to the meal. The menu is extensive and there are pleasant surprises with the fusion twist."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when having dim sum with my family uptown. Food is fresh and great quality, place is very clean and modern, and service is good. It's a bit pricier as far as dim sum in that area goes, but if you are willing to get up early, there is cheaper pricing earlier in the morning (I think it applies if you leave before 11am). Advantage of getting there earlier is you don't have to wait. They also accept reservations."}
{"text":"Came here on a trip to Toronto and we left mostly loving this restaurant. We arrived at around 10am on a Saturday morning and, as expected, it was packed! Here were some highlights from our experience here:  - A huge parking lot outside made it convenient to drive here and not have to worry about parking. - There were a lot of people waiting, but don't let that deter you. There was only about a 20 minute wait for us (a party of 2). - The restaurant was huge for a 1 floor/level restaurant. - The spacing between tables made for a very comfortable dining experience. - They don't force small parties to share tables with other small parties. We sat at a table for 4. - There was a good selection of dim sum, but it wasn't the best selection I had ever seen. - Most of the dim sum dishes were tasty, but comparable to average to above average dim sum I have had in the past. Definitely not the best I've had. - The pieces of dim sum were HUGEEEE, especially for the rice rolls, shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings, The rice rolls were thick and the dumplings were just flat out LARGE. - There was no cart service here that you might expect to find at dim sum restaurants. You order by marking off the dishes you want on a paper menu.  Overall, the service was quick and swift. It was a bit awkward that they brought out almost every dish one by one to our table, but other than that our experience was excellent here."}
{"text":"There's always a line here if u come during breakfast and lunch hours. Usual wait is roughly 20-30 mins if you're lucky. All the dishes are well presented. If you have a VIP card and pay cash, u get 10% off. They have a variety of dim sum dishes including really nice presented ones. It's good if you're bringing family here as the presentation is really nice. 1 star off because the service is quite poor. It's hard to get their attention and most of the employees do not speak English. I asked for mayonnaise and not one person in the entire restaurant knew what mayonnaise was. Another star off because it'll be hard for people who aren't Chinese to order and understand/communicate. So maybe download a translating app before u go LOl"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night for granny's bday.  This place was recently closed for kitchen reno.  Booked for 730 didn't get a table until 750.  Menu selections were limited.  We ordered a $298 combo with duck, lobster and fish.  Portions were small.  Service was ultra slow.  Neighboring tables were drunkards and they were so loud the it gave me ringing in my ears.  The roasted dock  was skinned on a pole to be a showpiece but  I can't bear the sight of that.  Not enough pieces for everyone.  Lettuce wraps were not enough for everyone and pieces were too small for wrapping. Live seafood tanks looked clean.  Decor was good. Birthday buns we whole wheat--a pleasant surprise. The food quality was no better than normal places but they were served on elaborate utensils. In some cases where the dish was served on a raised dish,  the  candles weren't lit up. The famous Concluding Chicken of Chinese Cuisine, I call it the 4C,  was  pleasantlt not dry."}
{"text":"Dim sum is the best here, once you manage to get in :)  The dishes are creative, large and elevated above the typical dim sum dishes, both in quality and in presentation. Typical dishes like har gow, siu mai and rice noodle rolls are about what you'd expect, but bigger than most places. It's the other dishes that are really creative and interesting, although some are more tasty than others, so make sure you like all the ingredients :)  Comments about the wait and parking are justified, so come with measured expectations there. The level of service depends on how busy it is (they should really hire more people for the rush). If you're going to go, be there early on a weekday (the morning deal makes it a lot more affordable), and expect to wait if you get there after 9. And if you get there before it opens, it really is a free-for-all to grab a table...so be prepared for that :)  Overall, one of the best places for dim sum in the city. Just manage your expectations for all the other challenges that come from choosing to eat here :)"}
{"text":"I like yum cha and always searching for a place that recall me of the experience I had in Hong Kong. This place definitely got it. The dim sum are all good and variety is pretty diverse. Price is good. Servers are friendly. Despite of the wait, nothing much to complain."}
{"text":"Very good dim sum place... Service was ok too...i love my dried fish and peanut congee..."}
{"text":"I was invited to this restaurant for a family friend's wedding, and upon arrival I thought that the place was kind of small for a wedding venue.  It didn't look like a place that would normally host a Chinese wedding.  They sectioned an area off for the wedding and still had regular restaurant guests outside of the section event area.  I was blown away by the quality of the food and the service was above average for a Chinese wedding as well.  Each dish was placed at the table and then served, which I prefer to having a family style dinner where everyone picks at the dish, because at a wedding it is common that not everyone knows everyone else at their table.  The food was the very typical wedding dishes such as bbq duck, abalone, shark fin soup, lobster, fried rice, etc. but I can honestly vouch that the quality of the food was better, the temperature of the dishes were hot and they didn't serve filler dishes like just broccoli or boiled chicken.  The presentation of the dishes were nice too and they had really nice garnishes like the long shreds of carrot and the rice chips.    The servers also made sure to make the alcohol was flowing all night."}
{"text":"Pros: Very well made dim sum  Cons: HUGE wait times  Dragon Boat is a very popular place for dim sum.  I went to place a couple of years ago and remember the wait times are pretty long.  I came again last weekend and it's still very long, lol.  Let me just get this out of the way.  If you come on the weekend, if you're not one of the first to get seated right when they open, expect to wait.  Then expect to wait some more.  We came at about 1120, and we weren't seated till 1230.  It's that busy.  There isn't even an early bird special here on the weekend but that doesn't stop people from coming.  Dragon Boat is comparatively much smaller that other dim sum places so that adds to the wait times.   Dragon Boat is a bit pricier when it comes to dim sum, but I felt they did a better job of it.  I've heard quality has gone down a bit, but I felt it was still better than a lot of the other dim sum places.  The dim sum was pretty well done and some of their items are prepared in their own original way.  I do want to mention that they have these trays that look like what you get at afternoon tea places.  They come with a variety of items.  The tray was $13 and not too bad for what you get on it.  If it wasn't for the super long wait times, I would come here more often for dim sum.  It sucks that there's no early bird special but I still feel it's a better bet than most places for dim sum."}
{"text":"Dimsum on a different level. Quality is beyond compare to any other dimsum place. Place is always packed. We have to come 15 minutes it actually open on a weekend and we need to line up outside. It opens on time and we were seated right away. The server just pointed you to a table on the other corner, not the kind of service I expected to think about how pricey and high the quality food they offer.  Food quality and taste make up for the first \"bad impression\" service we got. Hargaw has amazingly large shrimp  i love the taro puff , its smooth and hot when served. Everything we ordered, chicken feet,  siomai, beef ball , squid tentacles, tendon are really good.  Bill came and per order is around $5 each. Not really surprised at all."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my fav places to go for Chinese food in the Markham area.   Must haves: their daily soup. No matter what it's always delicious. Deep fried crab claw in shrimp: at $5 each it's not cheap but definitely worth the money. BBQ Pork: comes with fermented soy beans and so delicate and delicious. Sweet and sour chicken with pineapple and blueberries. Very little batter and all white meat. You won't regret it.   Their only down side is the wait. We have made reservations several times in the past but still had to wait for over an hour for a table. I wish their system for that would be better but it's worth the wait and I would just go earlier than your reserved time and hope for the best!"}
{"text":"Parking: Free and plenty. Even if there's none, you can park at the East Beaver Creek plaza and walk on over.  Venue: My friends brought me here for my birthday.  It's well lit, well decorated. The tables actually use cloth rather than some Chinese restaurants that just pile a bunch of plastic over the table and grab the top layer off to change over. The utensils were exceptionally clean, and shined.The staff are on point for our experience.  Washrooms: Well maintained and beyond the standard.  Food: As a vegan, I was limited to the buk choi, steamed vegetables and vegetarian dumplings. So I didn't get much of the experience. This is where they lose points on my review because my options of food were limited. But for non-vegans you can get the most out of your experience here for sure. My friends ordered a ton of dim sum (pork and beef), along with the congee."}
{"text":"I'll admit that the last time I went to this restaurant was at least about a year ago. But til today, that experience still remains in my mind and I must share it with you: I honestly do not see why people like this place so much. The food is \"meh\"... at best. Originality, I can see in some dim sum dishes however, for the most part, things are either bland, too salty, or just ok. It's always packed, parking is a complete nightmare... totally not worth my time and effort. Oh, their dishes are also huge, as in, it takes up all the table space but food not necessarily filled... be sure to get a big table if you're gonna order a lot or eat quick!"}
{"text":"Went there on a recommendation from a friend for my son's first month celebration.  I really liked that they had a website with their menu on it including banquet menus.  We created our own banquet menu to reduce the number of exotic delicacies as we had guests who weren't as familiar with Chinese cuisine, which was fine as we ended up having an all around pleasant meal even for the other Asian guests too!   Standout dishes: Peking duck 2 ways - well presented and cut in front of you. Skin was wonderfully crispy  Stir fried eggplant  with pork - a bit different, szechuan style with fried green beans too.  Suckling pig with jellyfish - well cut, tender meat with crispy fried skin."}
{"text":"I had dinner here for my father-in-law's birthday. Looking back, I would never come back to this restaurant due to poor service and overrated food. I had several entrees and they are as follows:  1. Pumpkin scallop soup- unique. I've never had it before so I liked it. 2. Fish with green vegetables - too much vegetables, not enough fish. So, it was an average dish 3. Peking duck - their peking duck was also unspectacular. They have the sides that go with the duck and wrap in this cool ikea-ish ensemble. But, there were random things in the tray such as marshmallows and raisins. Is that what their vision of fusion is?  4. Beef stir-fry - also average. a bit salty; not enough beef too many celery sticks 5. Battered asparagus/vegetables - yuck. it was a poor version of tempura 6. Fried oyster with mushrooms in a tin foil - this was pretty good, but they left chunks of ginger that can be easily confused with mushrooms. My brother-in-law and I ate into a whole chunk of ginger and were astounded. 7. Dessert- sweet bean soup, cookies, and mango pudding (good but a bit too sweet)  Overall, this place is overrated. It seems to cater to the elite and those who know the owner. They also took over an hour to serve us the rest of peking duck so by then our rice was cold, and we were fed up. We just wanted to go home. The waiters kept coming by and looking at the list of items we ordered, but their system seems ineffective because we still waited for an hour due to a mix-up. The whole dinner took almost three hours. So, be prepared to wait. I got home and felt sick. So, would not come back."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, very reasonable price for the quality. However, not an enjoyable wait in life if you are not there early (they open at 9 so try coming before then). Not a huge restaurant. Ice water is bottled water and is complimentary. Very friendly service and clean environment. Many dishes have beautiful presentation."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner before, never really had the urge to come back.  Some of my family members always insist in coming here for dim sum.  This will be my third attempt to have this dim sum here... First 2 times were unsuccessful because the wait times were so ridiculous. This we time we had family from out of town and mom wanted to come here to try their dim sum with the family... So I took the initiative to get a table for the family.. Place was completely packed at 9:30am, waited till about 10:45 for a table..  At the end of this experience, I can't really say that there was any dish worth 4 stars.. The food really was just regular 3 stars.. And it's not like it's super cheap. But the wait time is horrible.  Since this will be my last time coming to this resturant, 2 stars.."}
{"text":"Best dim sum restaurant in gta.   Price for value is amazing.  This place has blown every other dim sum restaurant out of the water.   the best deal is to go right before they open.  Yes,  there is a lineup at the door just before they open.   People actually fight to get in here.    Get a table and order before 11am to get the special price for dim sum.   If you get here by 9:30 or 10,  you can forget about getting the early bird deal special.  I judge the quality of dim sum based on their chicken feet dish and the fried taro ball.   And those dishes are amazingly perfect.  There are quite a few other dishes to try out including har gau, siu mai, and other steamed dim sum dishes.   They also have pumpkin congee and other traditional dim sum dishes  For dessert,  i always get the durian dessert.  Not to everyone's liking but i love it.  This place is busy on weekends.  Arrive early or pay regular price after 11pm"}
{"text":"The people that work here are serious assholes. The woman at the front that calls your number is such a bitch, the food is pretty good though. Will not be going back purely based on the customer service."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and every time, I never get disappointed.   This place is always busy so be ready to wait in line be it a weekday or weekend.   Today, because there is just 2 of us eating, the wait time was shorter.   Ambience is nice. Gold motif decorations. Tables and chairs are covered with gold coloured cloth.   They have special items like salted egg buns for dessert, deep fried seafood roll wrapped in seaweed, and almond shrimp ball. They also have the usual dimsum items like siomai, sticky rice, siopao, beef ball and congee.   There is $1.50 per person charge for tea. Credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"Dim sum was below average.  The special is only Monday to Friday before 11am and the price is over $3. The servers were so rude seating people at our table before we left."}
{"text":"I'm not a dim sum fan by any means, but when in Toronto..  Luckily we landed on a weekday and headed straight to Dragon Boat about 15 minutes before it opened. We heard the wait can get intense so we were sure to be the first seating. They have a pretty extensive dim sum menu with all the basics as well as some foodie-esque fusion type dishes like foie gras & mushroom rolls, Japanese ramen in pumpkin soup, deep fried taro balls with quail egg, and turnip cake with ham and sesame.   We tried all of the standard dim sum dishes plus a few others and it was really good! Everything tasted freshly made with quality ingredients. Because we came in on a weekday, all the S/M/L dishes were discounted, but you have to pay with cash."}
{"text":"One star due to terrible service. Waitress poured boiling hot water all over the table, into the dishes, and splashed onto most of us, yet no apology, no nothing, and just walked away.   The only way you can avoid waiting more than 30 minutes, is arriving before 9:00am. You will see a line already forming outside of the restaurant - and that's how popular Dragon Boat is.   All Dim Sum dishes before 11am are cheaper, I'm not sure exactly how much cheaper it is, but people go crazy for it. I have been here couple times and it's really a love hate relationship. I don't mind the wait, and I don't mind waking up early for good food, but their dishes just keep getting saltier and saltier! And I'm sure my taste buds did not reverse engineer, after eating out more and more often.   I always order their #02, 03, 04, 38 and 50. It's one of the better dim sum dishes you can get in this area. Others I've tired are a hit and miss, and the quality changes each time I come here.   The service here is slow, expect to get your dishes in a span of one hour, so come with people you can talk to, or else it might get a bit awkward. You can also order tea, and a waitress will walk around with a kettle of boiling water to refill the tea pots. First of all, they take forever to come around. I would be dying in salty dimsum food, and looking for the waitress half of the times i'm here. It's a busy place, they are trying to make money, plus it's Chinese operated - whatever. But what is unforgivable, is how sloppy, and unprofessional these waitresses are. We had our tea pot lid open, and the waitress started pouring the boiling water aggressively into the pot. Too much of the boiling water poured out, and it soaked a quarter of the table cloth, into all the dishes around the tea pot, and onto our clothes. She then casually walked away to the next table.  I have always returned to Dragon Boat, with friends and family, introducing dozens of people to this restaurant due to their reputation, their decent dim sum dishes, and great price in the morning. But after this event, I will not be returning, nor will any of my friends and family be returning."}
{"text":"We ordered 10 tapas and half were really good and half are average good. Overall experience is not bad. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I went there few times before for dimsum. I think the food was ok, price is ok, but the wait is nuts even with reservation. The only reason that I gave 4 stars is because I like the angus beef I ordered when I went there for dinner."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a five.  In Hong Kong, it would probably get a 4.  Due to the fact that seafood and fish in Hong Kong is caught and cooked the same day, the quality of the food they prepare and serve here (i.e. Toronto not having access to the same level of freshness due to our lack of proximity to the ocean), this place is pretty darn exceptional.  Went there today for lunch.  Waited for a long time in the line up but the end result was worth it.   Would strongly recommend as follows:  Curried cuttlefish - (tender, not chewy with perfect seasonings); fried squid tentacles with five spice (exquisite - tender, not chewy and not oily); shrimp and vegetable dumplings - good quality wrappers, not thick and not too thin and not too lardy tasting; hot and sour soup - perfect amount of white pepper and not too sour - good consistency; tofu skin wrappers with assorted mushrooms - not fried, steamed and delicate; Char siu bau - nothing special.  Better in Hong Kong.  Don't care for the sweet glaze -prefer the original steamed ones in Hong Kong (and available in Chinatown, Toronto).  Service - exceptional and attentive.  Tea - very good quality.  Chinaware - not chipped.  Without a doubt, THE best yum-cha you will find in Toronto outside of Guangzhou."}
{"text":"Excellent Dim Sum. I was \"gifted\" the experience of Dim Sum here by another Yelp friend who knows Dim Sum. I found the place extremely good. The best I've had thus far in life (I'm sure there's better, but as someone who isn't familiar with the cuisine, and has visited perhaps 10 different places in the GTA). My only complaint would be service, but it's still better than most Dim Sum places I've been to."}
{"text":"Tried tobcall ahead to make reservations for a sunday. They told us they dont take reservations and that we need to just stand and wait. During my 50min wait for a seat, i overhear them taking reservations, and saving seats for mrs so and so. So, because of this, i did not enjoy my food. Giving them a 1*. Never again"}
{"text":"Easy 5 stars. The food here was PHENOMENAL. Dim sum were hot, made fresh and absolutely delicious. Service at the dining area was quick and courteous. So, what went wrong?  UNLESS someone has a hook up... I am never coming back again.  Almost a 2-hour wait... are you kidding me??! Even with reservations, I heard you still have to wait 30-45 minutes. I only came here because mom's friend was raving SO MUCH about it and mom made me take her... she even had the puppy eyes look -_-\"  The waiting area was small. People pushing in and people pushing to get out. I pretty much had to wedge myself against a wall the whole time. I saw this girl and this man almost started a fight because he pushed her Chanel bag... what is wrong with these people.  The hostess was calling numbers out over and over again just to make sure people are still waiting. Very inefficient and inconvenient. Our hostess called our number 44, and literally gave our table away in front of us a second later... just because this one who just walked in had a hook up. The hostess apologized and said the next one will be ours. Then some woman came along and said 44 is hers. We told her off and said 44 IS OURS. We even showed her our paper with number 44. You seriously got to be careful because people WILL steal your number if you're not aware.  Finally sat down after a crazy battle. My mom said we are going to sit here for at least 2 hours to compensate the long wait time lol. We ordered like we were at a buffet because it was late and we were all starving!  The waiter looked at us funny and asked \"Are you sure you can eat THAT much?\" \"Yes we are sure, thank you :)\" I replied."}
{"text":"Both dinner price and lunch dim sum price are acceptable yet the food can still taste good and innovative at time. If it is about price, food, and environment alone, this place deserve 5 stars, and easily my first choice for Chinese Cantonese style dim sum and dinner.   However, what cost it a star less is their service. Their service is not bad, don't has room for improvement. That is they could be more attentive and considerate. If this area is improved, that would be awesome."}
{"text":"The food is amazing the but service is horrible. I waited an hour and they skipped my number and gave it to someone else. And only when I complained and made a scene was when they gave me attention and tried to scramble to get me a seat."}
{"text":"The 1.5 hour wait here makes the whole experience unbearable. We came here knowing that the wait will be long, but what happened after made us never want to come back again.   We got our number to wait for a table at around 11am. We waited nearly an hour for a table to become available. Our number was called and our group walked up to get ready to be seated. We were just ready to get seated when another group walked by us, straight to our table and sat down. Apparently they were regulars and talked to the manager and were given priority. We had to wait another 30 minutes to get our table.   The food itself was enjoyable and the food came fast (which is why I gave 2 stars). But after the frustrating experience of trying to find a table (and from them giving away our table), you are left with a bitter taste that can't be undone by good dim sum."}
{"text":"Quality of the dim sum here is top notch along with reasonable pricing when compared with the quality of food. Wait was long (about 40 mins) but was well worth the wait. Har gow, pork buns, lotus leaf sticky rice, spring rolls & beef rice roll were all amazing taste and quality. The squid tentacles were a miss and our siu mai didnt show up until after we paid the bill thus the 4/5 and not 5."}
{"text":"Waited in line for over an hour. It seems like no matter how long the line is people wait, so we decided maybe it was really worth the wait. It was overall - mediocre.   The atmosphere was nice. Big and busy! The food comes out at a relatively good pace. Ordered few items - har gow, shu mai, deep fried wontons with sweet and sour sauce, baked bbq pork puff pastry, beef ribs with honey and lemon sauce and finally pork and shrimp spring rolls.  My highlights were the - baked BBQ pork puff pastry, hargow and shumai. The steamed items were VERY filling, more filling less of the dough. The puff pastry was DELICIOUS! The best I have ever had..   I spaced out with the deep fried won tons and thought it was something else when it wasnt. So that was not appealing. Everything else was meh, nothing outstanding. I also order that uhmmm rice noodle dough roll thing - it never came. So we took that off of our order.   Would I wait another time for an hour to go here? Probably not, I would try and make reservations first. None the less it is not going to be my Go-To... but also everyone should experience it once.."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is the bomb! On a Wednesday afternoon around 1:30 pm (way passed the lunch hours I'd say) people still lined up to be seated and we as a party of 5 adults and a baby had waited over half an hour for a table; yet, it was well worth the wait!  All the dim sum items that we had tried were delicious!  The BBQ pork specials was a must-have; I literally saw the BBQ pork on almost every table I passed by!  The Steamed Shrimp Dumpling presented with a whole head-on shrimp was beautiful.  Everything was nicely presented and flavorful, except for the Steamed Pork Dumpling and the Steamed Rice Noodle Roll with Fried Dough that were comparatively less impressive (just a tad bland in the taste) but still not bad!  I'd recommend this place to those who love dim sum, like my parents who seemed to have enjoyed a lot!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy, dim sum and dinner.  Very authentic seafood and stir fry Chinese food.  When you enter you will see a full row of fish tanks with seafood such as lobsters, fish, king crab, etc.  Be sure to make reservations otherwise you won't find a table.  My go to dinner place for authentic Chinese food"}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum.  Very busy so be prepared to wait over 30 mins if weekends and holidays.  They have an early bird special : dishes marked S, M, and L are all one price $3.00 up until 11am, then it goes to regular pricing.   Once of the better dim sum places.  Great amount of food and good presentation.  Service was prompt (so they can get you out).  Parking can be a pain, just make sure you park in the correct spaces least you can get ticket.    Dinner gets busy too and it's also very good.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Preface: this review is for the dinner experience, NOT the dim sum experience (which isn't offered in the evenings).  When we first walked in, we noticed two things. First, the decorations. The whole restaurant is covered in gold and white cloth, from the floor to the chairs to the tables. The servers are all wearing fancy suits, and there's even a wall with a ton of wine bottles. It's not fancy like a steakhouse, but it looks nice, rather than faux-fancy. And second, we noticed the seafood tanks! You can observe the live seafood swimming and crawling around, including king crabs, lobsters, fish, shrimp, and geoduck (one of the largest edible clams!). They were all a lot of fun to watch.  Once we got to our table, we were presented with a challenge: navigating the menu. There are TWO menus, each containing well over 100 items, and many of them don't have clear prices. On top of that, some of the items were only in Chinese. If you're not Chinese yourself, figuring out what to order can be quite complicated. We asked for advice from our server, but that didn't help us narrow down - it just left us with even more options. It seemed like some of the dishes were more authentic, whereas others were more \"tourist-friendly.\" We ended up getting the \"dinner for 4\" (the one with BBQ pork, since there are two different \"dinners for 4\" - one per menu), plus some fresh scallops.  The dinner came with multiple different dishes which we shared family-style. Some of them were great, such as the soup, the BBQ pork (which was the highlight), and the stir-fried shrimp. Some were just ok, such as the scallops and the fish. Others were disappointing, such as the bok choy and the dessert. I think there's a bit of a learning curve - you need to figure out what's good (and what you like) in order to maximize your enjoyment.  Overall, the meal was certainly unique, and on the whole we had a good time. But the confusing ordering experience and the hit-or-miss nature of the dishes made it not as great as it could've been. If you know what you're doing, then you'll probably have a good time here. If you don't, then just be flexible and prepared!"}
{"text":"I loved the crab squash ramen!!! I would drive back just for this dish. Though my spouse was meh abt this dish."}
{"text":"We have been here twice, with friends, relatives and with kids. Both times we were very satisfied with the quality of main dishes and the dim sum.  Yes , there was a wait to get a table and it is a busy place. But in spite of the size of the restaurant, service was spot on and food was great. Sea food is really fresh, vegetable dishes are tasty. If there fussy kids, then dishes like chicken in sweet orange sauce are available and a treat for everyone. Soup dumplings are excellent. It's worth the wait. Go for it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was based on a friend and a review that a local food critic said it was the best. I say with different tasting dim sum dishes and even noodle dishes it was the best food you ever want to try. The wait however can be tedious as even people who reserve tables had to wait as people who got in line first and those who been there probably since the restaurant opened to enjoy this food. I will recommend reserving tables as early as possible and get someone there to hold your seats."}
{"text":"Good dim sum, pretty standard prices/service. Not the best but certainly not the worst!"}
{"text":"High-end dim sum place and it's actually tasty.  Offers the same types of dishes but presented in different styles and large portions.  It's always packed during typical dim sum hours and if you get in without a wait it feels like winning the lottery!  Will definitely go again but will try to time it so I keep winning the lotto!"}
{"text":"Good dim sum place. We were two without RSVP on a Sunday morning, super lucky to get a seat within 20 mins. The line up for bigger group is very very long. So RSVP is a must."}
{"text":"I am picky when it comes to Chinese dim sum in the northern America.  It was our first time to eat in Toronto and I am so happy that I picked this place because the quality of the food is absolutely top notch!  they have tons of variety, and each dish is quite delicious.  I wish I lived near Toronto , so that I can enjoy authentic Chinese dim sum more often!  I have been living in SF for a few years so I have been familiar with dim sum.  but still I am quite impressed by the food here. I think in some way the food is even better than the dim sum I have had in San Francisco.  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I really liked the food here especially the sticky rice and baked bbq pork buns. The typical dim sum dishes such as har gow (shrimp dumpling) and shiu mai (pork dumpling) were succulent and filling. I read some Yelpers saying this place was expensive, but it was actually cheaper than expected for us. It was around $100 for 6 people for lunch despite having ordered many, many dishes, so we ended up having to take home some leftovers in takeout containers.   I didn't like how we still had to wait for more than half an hour despite having made a reservation in the morning, and how all parking spaces close to the restaurant were reserved. It's definitely worth a visit for the food, though, and the atmosphere is nice. They also have high chairs for babies."}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious dim sum I have ever eaten and at a reasonable price. The sizeable super yummy dim sum dishes makes me overlook the long line ups."}
{"text":"Been here many times for dinner but first time for dim sum lunch.   We definitely come here a lot for dinner for birthday celebration.  We always get the Peking duck which is my family's favourite dish.  I also posted below some pics of dishes we ordered last year for dinner.  There was only 5 of us but we ordered about 11 dim sum dishes and a noodle dish which was way too much.  This always happen because everyone wants to pick their fav dishes and with my niece who is not a big fan of dim sum, she added the Fried Cantonese crispy egg noodle dish.  I highly do not recommend ordering this dish at dim sum because this dish is huge and you'll be too full to eat anything else.  All the dim sum was very good especially the Har Gow (shrimp dumplings) & Siu Mai (steam pork & shrimp dumplings).  Surprisingly, the only dish that wasn't too good was the steam chicken buns which I found the dough to be a bit dry.  I have mixed feelings on their service.  I made a reservation, we arrive on time and there were empty tables but they still made us wait for about 10 mins.  I also didn't like the fact that they brought the noodle dish which you can see in the pic below which was very well presented but they didn't offer to help us mix the meats and noodles until my mom stood up to do it.  They were very good with clearing the empty dishes and the food did come pretty quickly.  Overall, I would recommend this place for both lunch and dinner.  Just keep in mind the prices here are a bit higher compared to other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Dim sum mon-fri special price $2.99 s/m/l dishes if bill submitted before 11am and very busy when they open at 9am. They'll take reservations for after 11am but then  you pay full price which would double your bill easily.  Came here last Thursday slightly after 10am for table of 3, lucked on parking right at the front but it was really busy the whole front entrance was spilling into dining room, we waited over an hour and missed the special deal, so come early cuz to avoid disappointment.  Judy was the hostess and she was nice but firm, she even called the waiting list # in English. Make sure you get a scrap paper with a # for your party waiting list, don't think there's an actual line or que. My friend didn't fight/rush (being super polite)to the hostess to get a spot which made us probably miss our deal that am.  Had a 10 course lunch for a wedding a year ago and it was really good. Service and food was excellent, white glove service all food very fresh and hot. Menu a typical ten course but was happily full by the end and not thirsty so very good sign(min msg and salt used)  Parking does suck here."}
{"text":"My favourite dim sum place in the GTA, hands down. They have an extensive dim sum menu, with consistently good quality with all their food. The queues for both lunch and dinner are often extensive, so it's always good to call ahead if you want to avoid a long wait."}
{"text":"Always a wait but somewhat worth it. Depending on the wait time sometimes I just go to other decent alternatives.   The presentation and quality is somewhat better than the average dim sum place but there are just so many to choose from its really hard to distinguish themselves as being the best. If I needed to pick a place for best quality though I guess I would lean towards this place.  I believe they have morning deals too on weekdays but I usually go on weekends."}
{"text":"One of the better dim sum places I've tried in years! Really delicious dim sum, and I like that they add a bit of twist to all their dishes which makes them stand out from other dim sum restaurants but that they stop wouldn't be considered \"classic\".   Some of my faves are: Siu Mai topped with tonnes of roe (something I hardly see at dim sum places anymore), savory curry chicken pie (sooooooo yummy), salted egg yolk bun (could be less sweet), and their almond crusted shrimp ball (it's so crispy-licious!)!!!  Be aware of long line up though! It's a very popular place! Reservations might only help mildly.   After splitting the bill, it's usually around $20 per person with tax and tip."}
{"text":"Atrocious service. Had dinner recently for 10 people. The captain did such a poor job of recommending dishes that we did not have sufficient food. All he wanted to do was to make sure that enough expensive dishes were ordered like the $80 steam fish.Will not be back."}
{"text":"We came to Dragon Boat Fusion for a fam jam dim sum session over Easter long weekend.  With almost 30 in our group, some of us had to arrive early before doors opened to secure a few tables due to no reservations policy before 11am.  I straggled in late, around 9:30am so my relatives recounted their harrowing tales of dashing in with the rest of the early risers to get enough tables to accomodate everyone.  My cousin lost the lens cap for his camera and I think someone else almost lost an eye.  We ordered using the check off menus and food arrived shortly after.  It's hard to impress me, especially at dim sum time.  But the first bite of the BBQ pork bun with a delicate toasted topping had me hooked.  As the rest of the dishes arrived, I was won over by the selection, presentation and generous size portions of each dish.  Things got a bit hairy near the end when our server brought us our bill even though we told her we were still missing a few items from our order.  As she insisted that everything had arrived, our missing items turned up at our table.  Glad we could package that up before we left the restaurant.  No harm done but they were clearly trying to rush out the door as the massive hoard of hunger people wating for tables had now pushed their way well into the dining room.  Best dim sum meal I've had in a long time and the price - $2.80/dish before 11am was nothing to sneeze at either.  Wasn't a fan of the service at the end of our meal and probably wouldn't want to brave the lineups/crowds on a weekend but food was good enough that I'd make the drive up to Richmond Hill on a weekday.    Fell asleep in the car on the way home due to dim sum induced coma."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant if you are looking for a nice family dinner.  We had my sister's convocation dinner here with around 15 people and DBFC completed the day wonderfully.  We ordered:  1. Winter melon soup; delicious & enough to give everybody refills. 2. Peking duck; they cut the duck right next to your table and the skin was crispy while the meat was tender.  Although the paper did come in a weird sort of pot and the dressing were attached to the side ... along with some grapes and marshmallows ?? 3. The lettuce wrap was very good ... except they cut all the lettuce in half? I can't fit anything onto a piece that's the size of my palm! 4. The signature red wine back ribs were amazing! They cut the meat off the bones in front of you and with the sauce .. yummmm. 5. The sweet & sour pork was overly sauced and too sour.. 6. The soy sauce chicken was soft and tasty  7. THE ROASTED PIG WAS AMAZING. The skin was crispy but somehow still melted in your mouth; a must have!!  The service was a little rough as the servers were darting everywhere and they kept on dropping things on the ground (such as the ladle for the soup, bowls, and chopsticks). The restaurant itself is clean and bright with giant fishtanks in the front displaying live seafood for you to choose from.  I will definitely return when I'm craving old-school Chinese food."}
{"text":"Alas, I am sad to report that this review comes too late. My favourite suburban Chinese restaurant has shut down, victim of a dispute with the landlord over parking (turns out they were towing cars that had parked in spots not actually reserved for other tenants). The boat will live on, though, in new digs currently occupied by sister spot \"Cafe Cogo\" near the Costco on Yorktech Rd. I eagerly wait the Dragon's rebirth, and hope they keep on the fantastic staff. Tom's my boy, dog!!!  Correction, Tom is apparently an owner!!!   He's still awesome, though.   My apologies."}
{"text":"//WAIT\\ The place is packed early even on weekdays. If you don't want to wait too long and have a better chance at parking, come earlier rather than later. I think we waited maybe 20-30 minutes on a weekday at 10am. They will call out numbers in English once or twice, but the caller moves on pretty fast to the next number if no one answers, so be alert! Save some time by asking for the menu and start marking dishes while you wait.  //FOOD\\ Presentation is nice, food portions are very generous. Other than that, I don't really get the reason why they're so busy. Taste was kind of disappointing on staple items like siu mai, har gow, beef tripe. Might be better to order the novelty items instead. Also, wish we had ordered more dessert items, because the one we did order was pretty good. Maybe that's their strong point?  //SERVICE\\ We had one server that was really good. She actually seemed like she cared about taking care of us. However, everyone else was just rushing in and out. The \"managers\" really don't care much at all. They say nothing and just make sure to bring you the check quickly so they can clear the table for the next guests.   Since the place is so busy, it's easy to not get noticed, but once you're able to lock your order sheet in, you won't be waiting long to eat. The goal at this place is just to get food out and served, and they do it well. People come in from all angles to deliver your food and leave. Service is very cold, but food arrives hot and quicker than you can make room for it on the table or in your stomach."}
{"text":"We came on a Monday afternoon and was not expecting to wait an hour! It was extremely busy and we were starving. The dim sum here is more expensive than other places. S:$3.50 M:$4.50 L:$5.50 XL:$6.50. The food was tasty and fresh. The har gow was big and filled with a lot of shrimp. The white egg tart was really fresh and tasted so good and creamy."}
{"text":"It's the first and last time I am here. We came in at 4:30 pm and no one batted an eye at us. My brother wanted to try so we headed in. They just finished telling us there's no more dim sum but then they gave it to another table of older seniors. We sat down and they continued to ignore us. We waited for a while then got up and left. How Unfortunate...."}
{"text":"I LOVE Dragon Boat Fusion Cuisine because it has probably the BEST dim sums I've ever tasted in my life. Although the price can range from 15 - 30 per person, both the quantity & quality of the food are satisfying.  The Steamed Shrimp Dumpling (Har Gow) is the bomb, but I also love its Deep Fried Seaweed Rolls & Steam Salty Egg Yolk Bum. They are pure sensational.  The only downside is that this place is usually crowded with A LOT OF people even during the weekdays (which kind of gave me the impression that people don't really need to work in Richmond Hill). If you want to come here for breakfast, you need to come at 9 am sharp or it'd be hard for you to snatch a seat."}
{"text":"The service is abysmal. Waiters and waitresses are rude, the wait time is long, shorter if you make a reservation like we did (still 20 mins). The waitress was particularly rude to my mother which really vexed me. Food was fine, har gow had a lot of shrimp in it, siu Mai was meaty. Turnip cake did not have enough shrimp in it and was not fried well. Taro cake was heavy. Salted egg yolk custard bun was decent. Would've been happier with the experience if the service wasn't so terrible. Will actually not be coming back."}
{"text":"good dim sum. has the same flaws as most dim sum places. ie. serving dessert first and taking up table space. this place has a really good durian pastry dessert though. it's not a super strong durian taste and smell, which many people hate, but it's strong enough that a person who like durian (me) would enjoy it. they also have some bird cage thing that i wanted to try, but it looked pricey and it didn't look like i, personally, would enjoy most of the desserts that come with it. other people might though."}
{"text":"Line up 45mins before they open??! Boxing Day sale???? Are they giving out 50\" LCDs? How about a few door crashes gift cards? Where are the big bouncers in yellow windbreakers?  NOPE! It's Sunday May 8 @ 815am. yes ... I've hard bail my usual Sporting Life 10K run to spend to spend some time with mom.  Thinking I'd be in a warm Resturant or Church, I found myself and her standing in line, cold, along with the rest of the Richmond hill \"selfies'ers\" population waiting impatiently for this establishment to open. The only entertaining part is watching folks attempting to back into their parking spots. Yes, quite challenging in this part of town (if you know what I mean loll)  855a (5 mins before opening), after the staffs came out to take a few more selfies themselves, they open for the poor souls who are completely frozen from neck down.  This part is the funniest! Thinking there's a hostess waiting at the door way seating each part ...  Well, guess what? Not the case. Each table ready with a sheet of dim sum order sheet and the manager directors people to seat wherever you desire. Imagine playing musical chair but it's by tables and there's grandmas and grandpas everywhere.  Nevertheless I'm happy to report no one got angry or hurt during this event.  For those who didn't get a table, good luck! It's 1.5 hrs in and no one is leaving yet.  We ordered the obviously (since I've never been to this one) Har Gow and Siu Mai. Omg they are huge! Like each piece (comes in 4 per order) and the Har Goe actually comes with a steamed Shrimp. It was very delicious :)  Presentation is super awesome here, unlike most dim sum places and under the circumstances where all 50 ish table sat exactly the same time + ordering, the food actually came out between 10-20 mins of ordering.  Highlight of the visit: actual full whole shrimp in the Har Gow  Food (Taste): 5/5 Food (Presentation): 5/5 Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 5/5 Service: 4/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Fun Factor: 4/5"}
{"text":"Went here on a weekday Wednesday for lunch with husband. It was still pretty packed. Waited 10 mins or so to be seated.  Everything came slow, but fresh. We got the regular dim sum like siu mai, shrimp dumplings (They were really big and came with a shrimp in the middle) etc. Their BBQ Pastry is a must try, but they sell out quick. Their BBQ PORK with rice lunch special looks good i will try that next time as it comes with it's own candle/gas like that keeps the meat warm!  Parking: Very limited parking close to the restaurant but a separate parking lot on lower plaza is available.  Came on weekend as well with friends. Make sure you try to make reservations as we made a reservation for 8 and still had to wait 30 mins or so to be seated."}
{"text":"Went with my mom one Saturday morning and was seated after a brief wait. We ordered 4-5 dishes and were pretty full by the end. Large portions, with quality on par with Chinese restaurants in Scarb/Toronto.  Mom liked it but I wasn't at he biggest fan."}
{"text":"Wow. I did not have that high of expectations with this place as most dimsum place in toronto has disappointed me, but this place would have exceeded my expectations even if it were high. We came on a sunday afternoon and the place was PACKED to the max. We put our name down and waited for almost an hour before we got seats. Once seated we had: - stewed oxtail: i never knew this was a dimsum dish - it was delicious! - shrimp dumpling/har gow: it had a real unpeeled shrimp in the center of the four. So good! - peapod and mushroom steamed dumpling: great - chicken feet: YUM!!! - spare ribs and taro: sooo good! - chiu chow dumplings: had a lot of random stuff inside - another steamed dumpling  I can't remember what else we ordered but we had leftovers and the two of us the bill was about $35. I walked away a little too satisfied."}
{"text":"I don't get it but this place is very busy at the opening.  Seems like plenty of locals feel they get lots of value for their early bird morning Dim Sum value.  Personally, I don't think I will come back since I have had much better servings.  I always reserve final judgment after I have had a chance to see how my body chemistry reacts.  In this case, I got a headache on my temple after my Dim Sum lunch of 13 dishes, many XP versions.  This is likely a case of ingredients used not agreeing to my health.  Value wise, I don't see it.  Just because the Siu Mai looks bigger, that just seems so trivial....Taste wise, I have had tastier morsels throughout Toronto's Markham, Richmond Hill, Scarborough...."}
{"text":"Are you in a hurry? Very hungry? Have somewhere to be afterwards and can't be late? It's probably a good idea NOT to come here, then....  Judging food alone, the food is a solid 4.5/5 star. The dimsum here is fresh, beautifully presented and has tons of variety. You can always judge good dimsum from the har gow (shrimp dumplings) and the rice rolls - if the skin of the har gow or rice rolls is thin and translucent, without being flimsy, it's GOOD. And this place does that perfectly. They have great portions too! 4 har gows to a box. 4 chicken feet.   Now the con...the wait. Oh my goodness, the WAIT! My party arrived at 10:40am on a Sunday, and was seated around 11:20am. The parking situation is horrendous - even the parking spots DIRECTLY in front of the restaurant are reserved for other units in the building! You have to park down the hill, and schlep over from across the street, over the grassy/muddy hill.  Service is fine - clearly the servers are hurried to get people in and out as fast as possible.   Still...the food is delicious enough that I understand the wait. Doesn't mean I have to like it, though!"}
{"text":"Love their chashu. It is delicious and is served on a heated plate with candle underneath.   Dimsum is delicious. Always packed. Long wait times."}
{"text":"Very good dinner menu for a party of 8 people. Good scallops, lobster, roast suckling pig, roast bbq pork, and steamed fish.  Chicken was a bit dry.  The noise level is ridiculously high though, and the aisles between tables is very narrow (shared by kitchen and by customers can be conducive to spills if you don't watch where you walk carefully since staff are scurrying when busy).  Customer service is overly-exaggerated---even if you want a large tip at the end of the night, I hate to say that you're conversing more with the diners than the diners are able to converse among themselves.  But I guess that's just the way people like it when they pay money to eat there.   Parking is minimal, you have to eat earlier to get parking."}
{"text":"One of the best places for dim sum in Toronto. High quality and great taste. Be careful where you park and watch the one way signs. Lots of bad drivers in and around this restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  One of the better dim sum places I have been in RH. I see a few bad reviews on this place, and have never experienced stale or cold food yet, but to be fair, I have only been here a handful of times.  All the food we received came out piping hot and fresh. Their siu mai is one of the better I've had and the curry chicken pastry was also a hit.   The only meh thing was the ham sui gok. One of my favourite dim sum dishes and it tasted super weird.  As per some other reviews, they service is pretty crappy, but it's what you expect for an insanely busy chinese restaurant. The server threw all the plates down at us and barely spoke or made eye contact. Hard to get someone's attention and it took longer than it should have for them to notice we didn't have a menu.  Came at 10:30am on a Saturday. The wait for our table of two was just over an hour. Annoying but also expected."}
{"text":"Good: Food - Good quality food presented in a unique fashion.  Ordered a Peking duck and it came out on a pike at the end of a dragon boat.  That was a surprising sight! The accompaniments were not just the traditional green onion and cucumber but also included odd choices like fruity marshmallows, whole seedless grapes, and cherry tomatoes.  It was kind of fun but not all the combinations worked well with the duck.  Neutral: Parking - Lack of parking in the plaza, each unit has their own set of reserved spots and there is a woeful amount for the restaurant.  Better to park in the adjacent lot down the hill.  Bad: Popularity - The few times I've been here for dim sum it had always been packed.  Expect to wait.  Had a reservation one time for Chinese New Year and still had to wait an hour and a half for the table.  I think we were being skipped over in favour of people who were paying their way in.  Not cool but I get it.  Just beware.  Worth it? Food is good enough to merit return trips but beware of crowds."}
{"text":"Very popular and busy Chinese restaurant that's clean!!! They bring pecking duck in a pole and carve it by your table. Their dishes were all pretty decent. I liked their mango dessert and cookie."}
{"text":"I didn't make it to the restaurant.  So this review is based on take out, and comments from my friend and hubby that did eat at the restaurant.  Parking there is apparently atrocious.  But there are 2 people in reflective vests that guide you to park.  Inside the restaurant, before 11am (not sure if it's that you have to order before 11am, or you pay the bill before 11am), it's cheaper.  Not 100% sure of the pricing per dish, because hubby got seated at 1110a.  Dishes ordered include steamed shrimp dumpling, steamed assorted mushroom & vegetable dumpling, steamed pork dumpling, steamed angus beef rice roll, steamed rice roll with fried dough, deep fried octopus tentacles, steamed salty egg yolk cream bun, and  steamed egg yolk paste layer cake.  The general consensus was that everything had a lot of MSG in it.  We were all very thirsty after.  In terms of the steamed dumplings, the skins on the dumplings were very thick.  So thick to the point we questioned whether the dumplings have been cooked through.  Friend took a bite and couldn't stomach the rest.  I found the shrimp to be very fishy smelling.  Steamed rice rolls were good.  Nothing particularly special about it.  Octopus tentacles were good, no mushy pieces.  Steamed salty egg yolk cream bun looked deflated.  But i'm not sure if it deflated because of the time it took to get to me.  Steamed egg yolk paste layer cake.  This I liked, but I think I liked it because of a nostalgia factor.  Not many restaurants make this dessert anymore because of the amount of work involved.  Overall, I would skip this restaurant, and head to any other restaurant for dimsum.  There's better ones out there."}
{"text":"I love it, the food is great, the only problem is the waiting line is waaay toooo loooooong"}
{"text":"Very good, but very pricey.  I love their sweet and sour pork and braised beef with peanuts."}
{"text":"This was my first shot at Dim Sum and I'm very glad it was here.  The restaurant is deceivingly huge. It looks like a little hole-in-the-wall from the outside but has dozens of tables. My coworkers and I got a seat no problem when we strolled in around 12:30.  There was a little bit of a language barrier with our server but she grabbed a manager to come help with some of the questions we had. After we placed our order the manager came back to confirm our order as she thought we had ordered WAY too much, which we had. She went through the order with us and clarified some of the portion sizes. In the end we still had too much food, but it was so good we left almost nothing on the table.  Everything we had was really good. The wontons, har gow, squid, bbq pork, sticky rice, and more that I don't remember the names of.   After we were done eating the staff let us be. We had tons of time to kill and just sat and chatted while the staff cleaned up around us and got ready for dinner. When we were ready to go we asked for the bill. All-in-all it was $100 for four of us, which could have been less, but was still a great deal for the huge amount of food we got."}
{"text":"My Yelp friend would hardly takes me crawling  to high end restaurants, unless we are having dinner with our guests of honour...  Our guest of Honour requested to have Peking Roasted Duck and my Yelp friend gave me a list of classy/plushyrestaurants to choose from and I ended up picking Dragon Boat Fusion Cuisine.    Peking Roasted Duck was A-OK...   Skin was crispy and light.. I didn't feel guilty at all enjoy them! The pancake wrap was a little disappointing though, a little heavy and doughy for my taste.   The diced duck meat with lettuce wrap was excellent!! I love those crispy noodles that was sprinkled in.. gave the dish an interesting texture! Soft and crunchy at the same time!   Eggplant with minced pork in hot pot was not bad either... I have better but as long as my guests enjoying that, I am happy!   Service was lukewarm...as we were not ordering a lot of food or the expensive set abalone or shark fin meals...   BTW, the red bean soup dessert was excellent!! Tasty, tons of red bean and great texture!   Now, if I can convince my Yelp Friend to come with me for dim sum?? Maybe I need to find more guest of honours especially pretty and single ones..."}
{"text":"I'm been here once previously for dinner, but this review is for dim sum. This place is super popular - when I arrived around 1:30 PM on Good Friday, the place was absolutely PACKED, and my parents and I had to wait close to an hour for a table (and that was only because we agreed to share, otherwise the wait would have been a lot longer.) This place mainly stands out to me for two reasons: the unique food items on their menu, and the quality of the food itself. I can honestly say I was pleased with pretty much every single item we ordered.  Siu mai - These were larger than the ones you get at most other places, and just really delicious. I loved that they were flavourful without being overly salty, as I often find at other places. I enjoyed these so much that I immediately devoured two when they arrived at our table.  BBQ pork rice rolls - I usually avoid getting the BBQ pork ones because I've had bad experiences at other places where the BBQ pork is too dry and cardboard-y. Not the case here, the pork in here was lovely and moist.  Shrimp dumplings - Also really large, and came with an actual shrimp. As another reviewer mentioned, there was a bit of a fishiness to these that you don't find at most other places. I can see how it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I liked it because it indicated freshness to me.  Curry chicken pie - I think curry fans will like this. The pastry was delicious, had a bit of a sweetness/coconut flavour and was light and flaky.  Egg yolk custard bun - A lot of dim sum places don't even have these, so I always make sure to get them when I find them! The filling in these is a less violent shade of orange than I have seen at other places and also had less of a salty/egg yolk flavour (was more sweet) than I've had at other places. I think I would have liked a bit more filling though.  Chinese grass jelly cake and honey & brown sugar cake - Both of these items are pretty unique and good to try. The grass jelly cake tasted as expected and came with a side of condensed milk if you want some added sweetness. The honey & brown sugar cake actually tasted a bit like a chocolate cake to me, albeit a bit less sweet.  Tea tray - Comes with two layers, one with savoury items and the other with desserts. By the time this came out, we were pretty full, so ended up taking most of it home and I haven't gotten a chance to try some of the items. Some items include seaweed, beans soaked in honey, chicken feet, egg tart, papaya with coconut jello, mango jelly, grapes and an orange lol. I don't really see the point of getting this more than once, but it's a cool concept and looks beautiful!  The prices are a bit higher than your typical dim sum place (I mostly eat in Scarborough, which is cheap AF), but I do think it is worth it for the quality of the food. Small items are $3.10, medium $4.10, large $5.10, XL $6.10, special $7.10. The tea tray was about $13. Despite that, overall it wasn't too bad, our bill ended up being $60 for the three of us, and we were all really full. I thought service was okay for a Chinese restaurant - no one was openly rude at least. Experienced a bit of frustration with the tea tray because at first they forgot to put the order in, then we had to wait a long time for it. We had to ask multiple staff to check on it, and none of them ever came back to update us, so the communication was a bit lacking there.   I wouldn't make this my regular dim sum place because I don't think I'd be able to deal with the crazy weekend crowds, but would love to come back once in a while to indulge and try different items! Also good to note that on weekdays between 9-11 AM all items are $3.10."}
{"text":"After friends recommended this place and reading yelp reviews, I decided to give this place a try.  Taking the advice of fellow Yelpers I showed up half an hour before opening, and I was already third in line. If you go that early you'll be able to still find parking in front of the restaurant.  The restaurant opened on time, we promptly picked a table and seated ourselves. By 9:06am, the tables were all claimed and people already had to wait which is crazy given there's no early bird specials and everything's at regular price (on weekends).    The food was undeniably better than your average dim sum place.  A lot of the items were the same as other dim sum places but with a little twist.  For example the rice noodle roll with fried dough had Benito flakes on them.  The fried taro pastry had quail eggs, etc etc. Twists aside, the flavors were pretty on point.  Food wise it definitely deserves four stars.    The service is where I had to deduct a star. They were timely on removing empty plates and getting service started.  However, some of the waitresses (one may have been a manager) were busy talking to each other the entire time. They walked everywhere in pairs.  I tried to get their attention by saying excuse me but also raising my hand.  She saw me but then continued to walk away with the manager in full conversation about how consuming honey's good for the female skin.  It took quite a few tries before they finally acknowledged us even though they were literally standing right beside our table the entire time.  I'd understand if the place was packed and they were busy running around serving people but as busy as it was, they weren't busy serving people.    I would go back again maybe once or twice a year, but definitely won't be my go to dim sum place simply due to the volume of people and the crazy wait times."}
{"text":"Best dim sum, (even better than some in Hong Kong) Really cantonese! I loved all the dishes especially the curry puff pastries and milk tarts. Their char siu noodles were amazing."}
{"text":"Best dimsum place ever! It's decent price and great proportions. Expect line ups at this place always. They give free water bottles if you ask for water. It's clean, great environment, and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Don't go here if you plan to drive there, which is 100% the case. The restaurant is part of a commercial plaza building with very little parking and all of the parking spaces are reserved for each of the commercial units there. Finding parking is next to impossible and even though the parking lot across the street is empty, a parking attendant who stands around there will give you a hard time. The attendant will guide to you another parking lot just down the road, but no parking spaces that are not reserved exists there. I'd guess it's best to drop off a member of your party to get a table as the wait could be very long which is almost enough time to find an illusive parking space.  If you must go and don't want to go through the maddening hunt for a parking space, drive onto the parking lot across the street from the south side, far from the restaurant and park closer to the north side but not too close to the restaurant. Be sure to park next to other cars so it looks like you are there to go to the office building for the parking lot and not the restaurant -- it may seem strange on a weekend when most of the offices are closed there. And make sure the parking attendant doesn't see you.  I don't know why they ticket cars when the lot is mostly empty and you are not taking parking spaces away from the office building which is at the other end of the lot. If this restaurant is smart enough they should work out an agreement with the office building across the street to use their northern portion of their lot. This is no way to subject their customers to this kind of nonsense! Parking is such a turn off and I don't want to go through this experience again, especially for an ok dim sum meal with very slow service."}
{"text":"Dim sum is preventing me from ever switching to a vegan diet.   After trying over a dozen tea (or \"dim sum\" for the purpose of cultural appropriation) restaurants, hands down, Dragon Boat is one of the best in Toronto. There is always a line up outside the restaurant before its doors open at 9:00 am. You have to arrive early to secure a table, otherwise, the wait can be agonizing. If you place your orders before 11:00 am on the weekdays, there is a flat rate of $3.10 for all small, medium, or large dishes.   Below is a list of a few of our staples: Steam Shrimp Dumplings (Har Gow), steam pork Dumplings (Siu Mai), steamed assorted mushroom & vegetable dumplings, steamed pork & veggie dumping chiu chow style, steam beef balls, steamed seafood dumpling in soup, shrimp rice rolls, beef rice rolls  On a good day, when dishes are not over steamed, the aforementioned are juicy and succulent. My favorite dish is the steamed seafood dumpling in soup. The dumpling is wrapped with minced pork, crab meat, and scallops, then submerged in a savory broth. A candle is lit at the bottom of the bowl to maintain the temperature of the dish to ensure a consistent texture. Although the seafood dumpling is not authentic (the dish originated in the Ming dynasty with gelatinous soup inside the dumpling), it will make your soul sings!    Other notable dishes: Baked BBQ Pork Bun, steam beef tendon with chu hou sauce, steamed egg yolk cream bun, Fried glutinous rice wrap with egg yolk & conpoy   Entrée: My favourite lunch item is Japanese Ramen in Pumpkin Soup. The Japanese Ramen is al dente, in a rich pumpkin soup. Warm golden colours resembling sunset by the beach. The dish is topped with scrambled egg white and crab meat. YUM!  Our family is excellent at maximizing the value of each dollar spent at Dragon Boat! If we order before 11:00 am, we would order the typical dishes. However, if we arrive after 11:00 am, we have a strategy where we would order mainly extra large or small dishes and entrees for lunch. I attribute our value for economy to our distinctively Asian mathematical genes. It's ingenious! ;)   Visit Dragon Boat for a coma inducing meal! Your soul will rejoice!"}
{"text":"Went here a second time. There wasn't as long of a wait this time but still expect to wait for at least 30 minutes at busy times even with a reservation (make reservations!). Service is decent... very quick if a bit curt.  This is still my favourite dim sum restaurant. However, I now recognize that not all of their dishes are hits. I also discovered some amazing dishes I didn't try the first time. My ranking of everything I've tried here below:  Must-get: Baked BBQ pork bun, har gow, dragon boat fried rice, baked egg white milk tart Excellent:: Steamed BBQ pork rice roll, siu mai, duck meat and seaweed rice roll, steamed sticky rice with chicken in lotus leaf Decent: Steamed beef balls, angus beef rice roll, shrimp and veggie rice roll Avoid: Any of their congees including the plain congee and the katsuobushi and peanut congee. Also, steamed shrimp dumpling in soup"}
{"text":"The dim sum at Dragon Boat is quite good, better than most others I've had in Toronto in the past few years. I came in a large group last year and everyone seemed to enjoy the food. The BBQ pork buns were fluffy and light & the shrimp dumplings (har gow) were good.   The restaurant itself is comfortable and pleasant. Service is fine."}
{"text":"We came Saturday morning at 10:30 am and the lines were out the door. They don't take reservations before 1pm but the line moved rather quickly. Their portion sizes for dim sum are much bigger compared to Michigan. I recommend getting the egg tart, shrimp dumplings, and the egg yolk buns. I've also had their duck with noodles before and it was delicious. Dragon boat is not a place to chit chat after you're done eating so be prepared to be rushed out of there after you pay your bill, haha.. but again, it's because they're super busy and need to clear their tables ASAP. I'll be back here next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Other than the atrocious ONE HOUR wait, Dragon Boat really hits home with its dim sum.  If the dish is supposed to have butter, they put just a little more than the right amount. If the dish is supposed to have custard cream, expect nothing less than rich, tasteful, paste that melts in your mouth.  We ordered the following Custard buns - holy crap these babies hit it home. They do SUCH a good job making the custard flavourful and rich. The bun portion was also soft and fluffy! Everything about the custard bun was PERFECT.  Shrimp rice rolls - typical  papaya cake - The dairy used in the papaya cake made the dessert very rich and flavourful. I definitely tasted the papaya   bbq pork pastry - this was DELICIOUS. Flaky and buttery. Most Chinese dim sum places are usually very frugal with the butter when it comes to pastries, but this place just makes everything so dense and flavourful!!! I love it! Definitely worth the extra bucks.  veggie and mushroom dumpling - also pretty standard - but I really liked how well they did the outside skin of the dumpling. Most places make the translucent, jelly-like skin to thick and hard to chew, but Dragon Boat does a really good job at making it soft.  steamed fish - typical steamed fish dish. Fish was tender and not overcooked. Marinated with your vinegars, gingers, and sauces.  the special dim sum platter - this was literally just for the insta... it was kind of overpriced  Overall, this place is just awesome. It's definitely on the pricier spectrum for Dim Sum, but it's actually because they pay a lot of attention to making sure their dishes are of highest quality and taste.  Love you Dragon Boat!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Dragon Boat has tasty dim sum. The wait at the door on Saturday at noon was long. We waited for at least half an hour for a table for 8. But the wait was worth it. This is not a push cart dim sum place, but one where you order from a menu (and I prefer it that way). Some of my favorite dishes include udon noodles in a red broth, curry puff pastry, and roast pork bun. Not a single dish I tried was bad. Dragon Boat serves some of the best dim sum in the GTA."}
{"text":"I made my way up north to see what is the big fuss about this restaurant. My conclusion is that this place had prepared solid fine Chinese food like boiled prawns from BC, King Crabs, suckling pigs, or winter melon soup. Their ingredients were fresh. The price is what you pay for so I have no complaints about it. Service was good. Was it really outstanding? Not really. I just didn't have that satisfying feeling like I had from other places like House on Parliament."}
{"text":"Still my favorite dim sum place ever. We came around 10am on a Monday and had to wait about 40 minutes. Definitely go early!  Don't get the fish head, ox tail, and pig trotter. All subpar.  All dishes smaller than XL are $2.99 before 11am.  Get the shrimp dumpling, shu mai, chicken feet, beef tendon, sticky rice, congee, fried shrimp balls, and egg tarts!  And if you speak Cantonese, use it with the staff and they'll be nicer to you."}
{"text":"My review is only based on Dim sum experience. This is one of the best dim sum restaurants that I have been to. You won't be disappointed with the quality and freshness of dim sum dishes.  Dim sum specials are Monday to Friday only (exclude stat holidays) between 9am to 11am, any dishes size S/M/L are only $3.1. Cash only ***  My hubby and I came on a weekday. I wanted everything on the menu (nom nom) but we managed to narrow down to 8 dishes which were a bit too much for two people; we were stuffed and came home with leftover; bill came out only $31!!!!  - Har gow (steamed shrimp dumplings): huge fresh shrimps, no filler, shrimps have a nice \"crunchy\" texture to it.  - Sui mai (steamed pork dumings): large portion, super meaty and equally delish. - steamed beef tendon: yummy sauce. If you like tendon then this is a must. For people who never had it, tendon has interesting texture kinda like \"fat\" texture, but actually very low in fat and high in protein.  - deep fried taro with quail egg: very oily; the first 2 bites were delish then the taro nest fills you up fast. Probbaly won't get this again. - steamed rice rolls with veggies and shrimps: the rice layer is nice and thin, however, I didn't like the combination of shrimps and snow pea tips (I like them each separately but they don't go well in a rice rolls). I'll stick with the BBQ pork rice rolls next time.  - deep fried sticky pork dumings: it's fried and oily but totally worth the extra calories, so yummy and chewy.   ***Desserts: Deep fried durian pastry puffs are MUST (well if you like durian). This is definitely my fav; they smell amazing and taste just amazing. Warm sweet creamy durian filling inside and flaky on the outside. - we also ordered Steamed taro glutenous rice balls with nuts. I didn't care for this, too much carbs and not enough flavour.   They charge $1.3 per person for tea which I didn't mind as a lot of chinese restaurants start doing that now. This restaurant is nice and clean; actually has real table cloths (unlike most dim sum places with their thin cheap plastic table cloth). Service was sufficient and nice.   Be warned: 1) this place is insanely busy on weekends. You most likely won't get a table if you arrive after 9:15am for dim sum (they open at 9am). While the dim sum is really good, I don't think I would want to wait 45-60min for a table. 2) parking is very limited here; be prepared to park far away and walk."}
{"text":"Dim sum here are delicious and obviously prepared in their own kitchen and not previously frozen like other places.  Always line up but worth the wait.  The menu has a lot of good selections. We will be back but early next time."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  very good dimsum.  presentation is great and the tea is impressive.  Over half the pot was full of tea leaves, definitely did not stinge on that.   the seafood looks very fresh from the tanks.  This restaurant was very busy.   I would definitely come back for dimsum.  one tip is to arrive super early as this place can have a super long wait.  The restaurant was not even open and staff have not even arrived and the restaurant filled up. (on a Saturday)  only peeve i have is i did not see the sesame fried thing that someone posted on yelp.  I think they took it off their dimsum menu."}
{"text":"The dim sum was classic average/okay - not a WOW factor,  but it was good.   Dinner was amazing! Unfortunately, the special for the day was written in chinese and the waiter seems very busy/didnt have time to translate.   Peking duck - 2 course - crispy duck skin wrapped in veg/oyster sauce/ soft mini asian-style tortilla wrap. We had 3 ppl and devoured the whole course. 2nd course was the stir fry duck meat wrapped in cabbage, which was very flavorly/ not greasy at all.  Baby Suckling pig - very crispy skin and lean meat.  Stuffed eggpland/pork on sizzling plate - How can you possibly stir fry a dish that is soo flavorful/tasty, but yet to see a drop of oil on the plate!!  SOO goood and healthy dish i guess.    Next time, will try the shark's fin soup - seems like every other table ordered it."}
{"text":"One of the best Dim Sum in the GTA, pork cooked so well! But too much time waiting for a seat! Go there as earlier as you can"}
{"text":"I think Dragon Boat Fusion Cuisine has one of the longest waits I've ever experienced for dimsum in the GTA. People are just crazy for this place! Please be warned that even with a reservation, you should still expect to wait. I would advise to come before 11 am (with a reservation, of course!) to avoid the crowd.  If you can brave the wait, the dim sum here is quite good. In particular, they have very good bbq pork (char siu) so I'd definitely recommend ordering that. The menu is expansive and has pretty good variety. I do enjoy the food here overall, but the long waits deter me from coming on a regular basis."}
{"text":"We waited in line over an hour after coming here on a Sunday morning around 10:30. This place is large, but there are also waves of asian people who come so it gets busy very quickly.   I really liked the fusion concept for many of the dim sum dishes. I've eaten the same dim sum for over 2 decades now, so it's nice to see some new concepts for a change."}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday for dinner and like the previous reviewers mentioned, make sure you make a reso. Overall impression? Meh? There wasn't really anything bad, but there wasn't really anything good. I do want to try the dim sum in the morning because the pics look amazing, but for dinner? Underwhelming.   Food:  We were a party of six and ordered the the 4 person option + a peking duck. We should have ordered more, but really wasn't feeling the food.   Peking duck ($38 + $6 for lettuce option): they hang it like a schwarma (sp?) and cut off the skin hanging. Pretty standard except that the condiments include marshmallow (not a typo), grapes, craisins, celery, hoisin sauce. Pretty gimmicky and one of our more braver friends tried the craisins AND IT WORKS!!! Word of caution, if you ask for more pancakes, it's  considered another order....so load up the skin to pancake ratio!   Four person option ($78): Standard soup,  Half cold chicken, Steamed fish, Bak Choi with salty egg + century egg sauce,  Shrimps sautéed with vegetables, and the standard red bean dessert in the end. Everything was pretty ok? The only grippe I had was that the steamed fish was obviously not \"fresh\". It wasn't rotting or anything, but with a beautiful fish tank on the side of the resty it pains me that the fish was obviously butchered hours ago.   Service:   Pretty attentive, in the 2 hrs we were there they changed our plates 3X. If you ask for water they bring it to you in Dasani bottles + ice. And no, you don't get charged for it. However, you get the distinct feeling they want you to hurry up and get out. In the first 10 min of being there were were asked 3 times if we were ready to order.   Final verdict? This place looks posh, service is attentive if somewhat pushy, but the food is really meh? With so many different options for a great dinner meal, I wouldn't put this on my \"got to try\" list. By no means is this some \"next level sh*t\". I would however come back for the dim sum because the pictures on yelp look amazing!"}
{"text":"There's always a line up, always. For a good reason, the food is definitely above par for a great price, they set themselves apart with unique dishes that other dim sum places don't offer. Very fresh ingredients, you can tell from their shrimp dumplings and rice rolls. If you go to a lot of dim sum places, you can make the comparison yourself. If you don't want to be in line make sure you get there at least 15 mins before they open - be warned. Lol"}
{"text":"If you miss the old fashion dim sum, this is definitely the go to place.  Food are awesome and cook to order.    The size of the dishes are huge so be prepare when you order.  We are so used to small size of everything for the similar price range back home so we over ordered.  However, the managers there are very nice, they let us cancel some of the orders that didn't come to the table yet.    The restaurant is small, you need to wait at least 30 mins or so for the table.  Also, anytime you check out b4 11 am, everything is the same price so you can imagine the crowd.  Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is hella busy!! Be prepared to wait even if you make reservations which is what happened to us. We went on Saturday around 1:30 and it only died down around 3.   The service: average 3/5 The food: 4/5 they had specialty dim sums on their menu other places didn't such as the fried durian, beef pastry by other things were standard. It was definitely good but wasn't extraordinary like everyone says it is.  Atmosphere: 4/5 nice interior but the fishes all crumpled together in the huge tanks made me sad and I don't even like fish.  Speed: 2/5 pretty slow in my opinion and we wanted to eat certain things together and by the time it came other things were cold. It was noticeably longer not just by a little. Maybe this is normal? They forgot 2 of our dishes. the simple spring roll and shrimp ball. This is what made this place a 3/5. We just canceled the order at the end and mind you it was 6 people and we were there for almost 2 hours. They just completely forgot and when we told them they didn't even apologize they just said we won't charge you for them which like OBVIOUSLY we didn't eat it!"}
{"text":"I would say this is my favorite dim sum Cantonese restaurant ever. Good quality and affordable price if you come between 9.00am to 11.00am from Monday to Thursday. Cash only. The only drawback is any time you come to visit, please in line lol. But really worth to wait!"}
{"text":"This is one of the nice dim sum place to go to for food presentation.  Their har gow and siu mai are huge and tasty!  Definitely order their famous pineapple char siu (bbq pork) buns.  I also really like their char siu rice that is only available after 11am.  Expect long waits or go early as it's a popular place for dim sum."}
{"text":"I definitely like coming here for dim sum. While it's not your typical traditional trolley service, the decor here is fantastic and you'll enjoy having a meal with family and friends in this ambience.   The food here is always served in large portions and is always very fresh. However, the wait is often very long. If you're trying to get that early morning special, make sure you get up early!!?"}
{"text":"Best dim sum. Best price. All the fish and crustaceans in the aquariums are healthy. What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"We went here for dim sum at 1pm on Saturday and this place is packed!! We made reservations and still had to wait around 20 mins for a table.  The food is quite tasty. My favorite was the bbq pork and the shrimp dumplings. The bbq was juicy, perfect amount of fat, and 9$ for quite a good portioned plate and rice or noodle. The shrimp dumpling was very big and was packed with large pieces of shrimp."}
{"text":"Good place to come for Cantonese style food. Service was quick and food arrived accordingly. Came here for dinner but I heard it's good for dim sum as well."}
{"text":"Meh...  As a person who's had my fair share of dim sum, the fancy chopsticks, crazy desserts and attempts to make dim sum more than it should be wasn't impressive.   I heard about this place from friends and from watching food bloggers rave about how AMaZiNg the food is here but to be honest I wasn't impressed by the dim sum itself. Sure the desserts were fancy and there were some outrageous rice rolls (eel and avocado) but I was hoping they would have turned simple classics into new gems. Instead, the eel avocado rice roll was how do I say...friggin gross? Chicken feet was OK, spare ribs was a oily mess. Overall I feel like they try really hard to turn dim sum into something it doesn't need to be.  The saving grace came from staples like haw gow and siu mai. They were made very well and it was probably the best siu mai I've had (they were huge). Their service was also something that prevented this from being a 2 Star.  I would probably go back if I was with a group that had not been there before, but would recommend other places first like Perfect Chinese."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3-4 times for dim sum over the past 10 years because this place is always jam packed. If I were to rate the place on just those experiences alone, I would give them 3.5 stars. The dim sum is definitely above average in quality and the portions match the price. However, as there are plenty of other good places for dim sum in Richmond Hill and Markham, there is nothing special about the food here which makes me think I should even attempt to get a table here, especially on the weekends.  Fast forward to today and I've eaten dinner here about 3 times the past year. We order a variety of different things each time. The geoduck is amazing. Get it sashimi style and enjoy how fresh it is. If you opt to do hot pot, only dip the geoduck in the water for only a few seconds. It's expensive but the quality doesn't get better than this. You can add $10 to get a secondary geoduck dish in congee style which is very good value in my opinion. You do not have to pay bowls of white rice any more and it fills you up quickly.  The crispy oyster dish was cooked to perfection with red wine. You still get that oyster consistency at the middle of the meat.  The highlight was the free range soy chicken. It was juicy, moist, had right amount of tenderness and I proclaimed it as the best chicken I've ever eaten.  Service was never for a problem for me. I felt like the staff were always trying hard to accommodate everyone and it's not their fault the place is so popular. We always got our food at a reasonable pace and the waiters regularly check on whether your teapot needs refilling or if a dish hasn't arrived yet.  I am definitely looking forward to coming back to try their king crab, lobster and peking duck. But for now, I rate the dinner dishes 4.5/5 and their service a 5/5. Be sure to book a reservation for dinner at least a week in advance. Yes, it's that busy."}
{"text":"-Limited selection of items -Bad service followed by hovering over my table to peek at the tip amount -Found it to be vastly overrated, won't be back"}
{"text":"I don't really understand all the hype some of reviews are raving about.  Decided it must be worth the wait because even at 10AM without any early bird specials, the place was packed! Easily a 30min wait at this time. Was thinking of driving away as I have not faired well with Dim Sum lately (re: Bonflavor).  Well we invested the time so we might as well see what it's all about. Don't get me wrong, the place is really nice.  Outside is an industrial strip mall with nothing extraordinary to make it look like it was a nice place.  Inside, I was expecting folding chairs and chaos.  Instead it was a wall of fresh seafood tanks, high ceilings, granite walls and decent tables and chairs - once again ladies and gents, don't judge the book by the cover. We ordered a smattering of food.  The HaGaow was OK, not fantastic.  The Pork Bun that is features was...meh.  The tripe was good.  The Steam Beef balls was pretty good too.  The spring rolls was a disaster and the almond shrimp ball was not all that impressive.  The two dishes that had Taro wasn't too bad.  There were other items but not memorable. The service was acceptable and the food came out in a steady stream.  The menu was a little complicated as items that were not available until 11AM was available yet not available...do you follow?  No?  Neither did I!!! The place reminded me of Casa Victoria, a place I won't return to, but I may give this place a try again somewhere down the line. 2.5 stars  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I joined a friend with her family here on a busy Saturday evening. We were a big group, and her uncle had apparently ordered when he made the reservation because the food started rolling out within a few minutes of us sitting down. 14 dishes later, I waddled out the door so stuffed! Peking Duck, lettuce wraps, some fennel thing that was to-die, red bean soup for dessert, and so many more that I can't even remember - ALL delicious!  I'm so glad I was able to experience this place with locals because I tried things that I probably never would have ordered on my own. Next time I might have to order something from the tanks... whatever it is, I'm sure it'll be amazing."}
{"text":"Actually I LOVE dim sum here. It's crazy how busy this restaurant gets.  If you come* before 11am (on any day), all dim sum items are $2.80 each (except the \"Chef's Specials\") *if you ORDER before 11am  If you come at typical lunch time on weekends (11am to 2pm), expect a 40 minute wait. YEP.   On my last visit here, we arrived at 10:50am!!!! We got seated right away, and we frantically checked off our items on the menu, then I shoved the menu in the waiter's face asking, \"Are we going to make the special price before 11am!!!!????\" He said, \"We'll see what the kitchen says!\"  He came back, and the time stamped on our menu was: 10:58am  WE MADE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!  YES I LOVE the dim sum here! I DO!!!! I think everything is soooo delicious. My boyfriend and I are huuuuuuge fans of Dragon Boat's dim sum.  My particular favourite (I didn't expect this!) is the Steamed Rice Noodle with Scallop (#41) which is drenched in XO sauce and dried shrimp paste (it tasted like it) -AND IT IS SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!  Like everyone says... \"Fusion\" Cuisine???? The owners probably like the word \"Fusion\" but don't know what it means. The Chinese name of this restaurant is actually just \"Dragon Boat\" with a really cool typeface and logo.  The service is okay. If you speak Cantonese or Mandarin well, you should be able to handle them (they are the fast, hardworking Asians who are very impatient with slow, indecisive people). They are VERY quick and they seem rude, but my parents are also like that... I got used to it. Just be nice to them and they'll crack (the ugliest but they tried) smile.  CHECK OUT THEIR CLEAN TANKS OF GIGANTIC LOBSTERS AND FLOUNDER FISH!!!!"}
{"text":"Parking is a major pain in the ass. I don't even know how you're supposed to park here. However, very good dim sum. It's pricier than other dim sum places but the quality is quite nice. The food is nice and tasty and not super oily and greasy and gross like a lot of other places. It does get pretty rammed inside, so be aware of that."}
{"text":"Favourites: Seafood pancakes, steamed beef rice roll, shrimp rice roll, Har gow steamed shrimp dumpling, Taro dumpling with boiled quail egg, Peking duck (requires 24 hour pre-order), honey beef ribs, seafood bird's nest and egg tarts. Finished the meal with excellent red bean soup for dessert. Cons: Parking is a nightmare, long wait times to be seated (even with reservations you will have to wait 20-30 minutes for my table) and for food (another 20-30 wait after you order food) ."}
