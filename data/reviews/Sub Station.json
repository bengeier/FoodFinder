{"text":"This place used to be pretty good when it was Sub Factory. I haven't been since they changed because I didn't hear good things about it. It's basically the same menu but is not the same. The bread was bland along with the sandwich. I got the 3 cheese sandwich, which came with 3 super thin slices of cheese that together maybe equaled one normal size slice. Won't be back."}
{"text":"New ownership and new name.  Everything is SLOW!  I thought I would allow the new staff a few weeks to get 'up to speed' before going negative but there's been no improvement."}
{"text":"Miss original crew.  Took 20 min for ham and turkey deluxe and they they had the ingredients wrong.  2nd order, ingredients wrong again.  Never coming back. Shouldn't have messed with a good thing."}
{"text":"I love this place! The sandwiches are ample, the service is great, and it's clean! Their cold subs are 10 inches long. Just right! I particularly enjoy their Spicy Italian for $5.79. The prices are very reasonable. They also have Gold Peak ice tea which is so good. I highly recommend this shop on Broadway, west of Hardy in Tempe."}
{"text":"Honestly I am not one for cold sandwiches BUT The 8inch combo with everything on it is YUMMY. The restaurant was clean and the service was great! I am so glad I reached out of my comfort zone and tried this yummy place. Trust me, they do not disappoint."}
{"text":"Simple sandwich shop that is perfect. The $3.50 combo sub is the way to go!

Service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This definitely beats out all the basic sandwich chain restaurants. The workers were very friendly and offered to wrap up my sandwich when I couldn't finish it all. Their menus items are very unique! I got a roast beef deluxe and it was one of the best roast beef sandwiches I have ever had. Definitely worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Order seafood avocado sub.  Was ok but would have been better if they would have actually put avocado on the sandwich.  Pretty basic sandwich but nothing special."}
{"text":"I never have an issue with Sub Station until today. I am extremely disappointed with the owner.  He told me to my face that he would not make my food. This is during regular business hours.  I recommend Dillys up the street on University. They never turn me down."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Been visiting weekly for several years. Great subs and friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"The pastrami deluxe is the best! this place has great food and friendly service. locally owned and operated which is a plus. they also have voodoo chips which are kinda hard to find and such a wild flavor."}
{"text":"Awesome Sandwhich! 17inch combo is a great deal! Very friendly staff and nice place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"I used Postmates today for lunch. I got a basic cold sub and a bag of chips. I get my order to my desk and open the sandwich and the bread roll is rock hard. Both the top and the bottom of the roll were not even able to be ate. Very dissatisfied, there goes my lunch!"}
{"text":"This spot used to be good for many years, but now the new owners have ruined it. They are slow, unfriendly, and the quality is no good. Also if you want hot peppers on your sub they charge you .49 cents, if you want pickles they charge for those too! But not like a big pickle or even a spear.... They charge you for the slices on the sandwich. Crazy. Won't come here anymore, not once."}
{"text":"This used to be the Sub Factory but they got to keep the menu just had to change the name. The new owners are great and friendly. While they have maintained the menu they haven't gotten the knack of the taste of the original  Sub Factory. I would still check them out. Only with time can they get better!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly service, great food with good serving sizes. Would recommend to anyone looking for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Great spot, friendly staff, fast and very cheap. The subs taste great and i always get the pastrami. I totally recommend to all because what other sandwitch shops do you know that offers a 17 inch sub for $7!!"}
{"text":"What happened!!!   Sub Factory is now Sub Station.  New ownership and the staff is fumbling over each other.  Took 15 mins for a ham and cheese.  If they don't get it together this place is doomed.  The original guys took 2 mins for almost any sub.  Not going back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here frequently for a year now. I love the firecracker chicken and the  texas bacon bbq sandwiches. Be prepared for heat with the firecracker but it is delicious! The staff are some of the friendliest people you'll meet. They have always taken great care of me. I'm sad to be leaving my job down the street for other opportunities because I really will miss this place while I am gone!"}
{"text":"New name same place, I got the club sandwich.  Fast sandwich, but I feel that this is sandwich that I can make at home.  There is a potbelly shop up the road I can go get a sub for the same price with better quality.  I think it's time to update the menu and the decor.  I have been a customer for 15 years, this was the first visit in about 10 months.  I think I will drive a little further next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I come here legit like 4 times a week. We LOVE this place. It's a small shop but has lots of options. We split a turkey bacon melt most of the time but anytime we branch out, we are never disappointed. 

I love the people who work here. They're super friendly, remember our orders & are always quick with it. 

I also am a HUGE fan of any place with stamp cards. I love free shit."}
{"text":"I absolutely love going to this place. Their customer service is great and their subs are delicious. Very fresh veggies. I had really good avocado not like the mushy one from other sub places. It's a must go!"}
{"text":"Under new ownership... just not the same since the old owner, Terry sold the business.  They take forever to make simple sandwiches.  I walked in today and noticed 3 employees standing around watching 1 other guy make 1 sandwich.  They all looked very lost and confused.  I don't know why I keep coming back, maybe hoping I'll get that wonderful steak and cheese Terry made, it never tastes the same.  Going on 10 minutes now and still no sandwich..  The place is never busy like it was before.. so disappointed..."}
{"text":"I had the combo sub. Food tasted like something I could make at home. The bread was several days old based upon freshness. The meats were subpar to other sandwich shops like Jersey Mike's, I watched sandwich meat slices being unpackaged and cut in half by employees. Vegetables on the sandwich were sparse. The manager watched me wait for quite some time, although it was during a busy lunch time. She gave me a free soda. Overall the price was right, but the sandwich was not satisfying in terms of quality."}
{"text":"First experience here was top notch. Asked for recommendations and decided on the avocado turkey croissant sandwich and got a side of the pasta salad and a drink for like 9 bucks. The sandwich was huge and delicious. Service was quick and friendly, which was more than I expected after reading previous reviews. And the owner gave me a punch card for a free sub after 8 sub purchases. I think next time I'll try the crab and avocado sandwich."}
