{"text":"Best shwarma I had in a very long time!!!! The chicken is juicy, all white meat, no grease or fat and the marinate is just awesome. The portion is big and priced reasonably. The staff are friendly and accommodating. The fatoosh salad is out of this world, just the way it's made in the middle east!!!  I have been to many shawrma places, nick's famous shawrma is the best shawrma I had in the GTA!!! I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma at this mom and pop shop is better quality than most other places so it is priced accordingly. The dinners here are more expensive than competitors in the area but at least they have some quality to back it up. Wraps are also pricey but they are big.  The fattoush salad really is fantastic"}
{"text":"Schwarmas are one of those things which I think is just hard to screw up.  You marinade the chicken, let it slow roast and shave it off.  How hard can it be?  Having driven by Nick's many a time, I tried it, and surprisingly, Nick's managed to disappointed me.  The combination of dry, under marinated chicken, boring toppings that were too cold, and average pita bread was underwhelming, and given the competition from other Schwarama places in the area (Pita & Grill, Paramount, etc.) it's hard to justify going back.  The chicken was dry and didn't have much flavor (maybe not enough marinade).   The boring toppings  included garlic sauce (average - Pita & Grill's is much better), parsley, pickled beets, hummos, tomatoes, lettuce and banana peppers.  The toppings also seemed a bit cool, causing a strange contrast between the warm chicken and toasted pita.   Pricing was similar to other establishments in the area, $5.99 for a chicken or beef schwarma.   I'm not trying to rip on this place too hard. I will say their portions are better than Paramounts, which serves a tiny sandwich but has better taste. I'd be hard pressed to recommend this place, especially given Pita & Grill and paramount are 30 seconds - 2 minute drives away."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!!! If you're the type that likes greasy, mystery meat in your shawarma then do not come here.  Nick's Pita could very well be the love of my life. I consider myself a shawarma connoisseur of sorts and have sampled numerous offerings from all over the GTA and beyond. Hands down, Nick's is number one in my books. The chicken is well seasoned, white meat, with the perfect amount of crispiness around the edges. The toppings are on par with other joints carry, and personally I like their garlic sauce - I find it to be more of a traditional Lebanese style.  Definitely give it a try!   ps - the lentil soup is delicious :) pps - they have a points card where you accumulate earnings with every purchase. For every $100 you receive a free $10 gift card....and yeah I'm on my third one."}
{"text":"I had never tried a chicken schwarma that wasn't filled with fat and full of unidentifiable meat until I tried Nick's.  These schwarmas are amazing.  The meat is all white meat with little to no fat and they are generous with their toppings.  Best of all... they grill them once they're done.  The Fatoush salad is also fantastic.  There is a lot of lemon in dressing which makes it super tangy.  Hope you enjoy."}
