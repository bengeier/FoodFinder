{"text":"We love their ranch dressing, warm bread and chicken parmesan.  We were happy to get seated quickly. The mozzarella sticks are homemade and delicious. Our family really enjoyed them as an appetizer. The food came out quickly and our waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, clean. There were about fifteen of us dining that night: dinner was served promptly and waitresses were friendly."}
{"text":"First impression of the restauarant in its new space? Filthy carpeting.   Food was ok, our salads were wilted, however, and waitress never came to check so that I could even mention it.   She brought our lunches and asked if she could take thee salad plates that we obviously didnt eat. I said yes, they were a bit wilted and she didn't apologize or offer to make it right.   The owners son was sitting at the bar as we tried to cash out, he yelled for his mom to come up front.  She never asked how our meal was, said thank you or even smiled.  I was going to book a shower but I wouldn't subject my friends to this place."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks ago and I didn't have a very good experience at this place.my waitress was very friendly. I ordered a salad and it tasted like it was in a bag before I ate it. It took quite a while to get our food. I ordered spaghetti and it was such a small portion of food. While I was looking at the menu I noticed how expensive it was. It was about fifty dollars for the three of us. Not worth it"}
{"text":"My husband has been asking me to try Davitino's Restaurant for months, I finally gave in and I regret that I did.  We sat at the bar while waiting for our table.  I asked if they had Malbec wine and the bartender had no idea what I was talking about.  We ended up getting a Pino Noir instead. It was served in a non-red wine glass with a thick rim. I prefer red wine to be served in an appropriate glass.  We were seated in a booth at the back of the main room.  Our waitress was a sweetie and took our order immediately. I looked to my left and had full view of an area with brooms and cleaning supplies - gross!  Our salad was served and it was just okay - nothing great. The flatware was pathetic and old. My husband's coke was served in a plastic glass.   The food was average and frankly I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"i've only been to davitino's twice.  once in the 80s (when it was closer to rt 306) and just recently at their mentor ave town sq location.  i can only review what i had, and it was great.  their eggplant parm is breaded and fried, just like grandma used to make, sitting on top of pasta (rigatoni or spaghetti), with a fabulous spaghetti sauce.  just great !!!  so eggplant parm, including soup or salad, iced tea, and ice cream for dessert, all for $20.  needless to say --- i will be back !"}
{"text":"Food was ok, similar to what I make at home.  Salad wasn't the best. The Service however and is pretty slow.  When I first walked in the lady at the register never looked up or ask anybody for their name. The waitress was overloaded with tables. I thought she forgot about us. The place was clean though and the people were friendly. Most likely I will not go back."}
{"text":"We were visiting relatives in Mentor, and I Yelped Italian. And did I find a good one in Davitino's. I had the best sausage and peppers ever! And it was enough to feed two. You could tell the ingredients were fresh. My wife had lemon chicken which was also outstanding. My sister-in-law had the eggplant Parmesan, which she said was the best. The meal came with Italian Wedding soup. We all loved it.The service was also outstanding. Next time we are in town, we will be here."}
{"text":"They have relocated to a strip center near Heinen's on Mentor ave heading east.  Can't wait to try it"}
{"text":"We had a similar experience as some others. No greeting from the Hostess totally dos not make eye contact or welcome us or make any attempt to acknowledge us coming in the door. She was checking out a customer but still had time to look up since she had to wait for credit card machine to process the bill plenty of time to greet incoming customers. When she was done with this check out she was going to check out another person instead of greeting us but the gentleman deferred and asked her to take care of us first \"Thank You Sir\" a true caring person. So she seated us finally. We had the chicken Parmesan and it was very good plenty enough to share between my wife and I. We asked the waitress and found out the rude woman hostess is the owner. I was going to let it go but after reading the other reviews with the same comments I felt I needed to share this also since it seems not to be an isolated incident. To sum it up the food was great and service from waitress good but the owner needs to hire a hostess with personality and then sit in a back office and count receipts out of sight of the customers."}
{"text":"I crave the sausage and peppers from here!  It is homemade sausage served with peppers and rigatoni.  I can't imagine getting anything else from here as my main dish.  The calamari is also delicious, cooked perfectly.  Bruschetta is tasty and tomatoey.    The wedding soup is very filling, if you get it, try not to fill up on it.  Or do, in which case you will have lots of leftovers because their portions are large."}
{"text":"I'd kill to have this restaurant in Columbus. Hands down my favorite Italian place anywhere, you can't beat the quality and quantity of food plus a great relaxed but quiet atmosphere. I'm so sick of gimmicky Italian places that are more worried about goofy junk hanging on the wall then they are food quality.  Every time i come home to visit my parents in South Euclid i make the drive out to mentor just for this place. That having been said they seem to close for business for every little thing they can get away with, which really gets annoying as i have limited chances to get to eat here.  I strongly recommend the wedding soup, by far the best i've had in a restaurant, and the chicken parm is my personal fav."}
{"text":"It's a hard to find authentic Italian in such a saturated city. Years ago my family would come here for my great grandmother's birthday every year at the original location, It was phenomenal. Their food is still great, but things have changed since since they re-located."}
{"text":"Found Davitino's via Yelp.  Read the reviews and sounded like a good place to try.  Overall pretty good.  The dinners were above average.  The Chianti was excellent and well priced.  Our server and service was a bit off out of the gate, but improved as the evening went on and we got her engaged with the table.  She was actually the bartender reassigned to handle several tables.  Not a happy camper at first, but did come around.  All in all, a good place with a nice menu.  One suggestion, at their price point, they need to invest in table cloths and a bit of ambiance, like Italian music instead of the rocker that serenaded us most of the evening over the speakers..."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious authentic Italian food! Good sized portions and very flavorful. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I hope this place closes down! The service in this place was a joke. I ordered soup to go and when I came in to pick up the soup the lady that was behind the counter was worthless carcass. She was so rude and ridiculous. I handed my card to the lady and she looked at me like I was from Mars. Mind you my bill was $ 4.00, she asked me to sign I signed the copy and she asked for my ID I handed her my ID and then she told me that my signature wasn't real. I looked at her like she was joking. Then she told me that she won't play games and that there is an officer in the restaurant. Then she took my card and my bill to the officer. WOW, she came back stating that the officer didn't think anything of it. Then she asked for my ID again she wanted to write down information from my ID. I grabbed my card from her hand and wanted my money back. I wish I could have tried the food in the place. But because of the service I will not ever step foot in this place again. MIND YOU 4 F***ing dollars."}
{"text":"So, it's Friday night. I'm downtown at work. Wife is working 12 hrs at hospital. So we're talking about dinner and can't come up with any ideas. Fast food sucks so bad and know that Friday night without reservation is a nightmare. So, we had to drop off daughter at a friends in Mentor anyway and I had heard Davitinos was open in new spot. Old place was pretty good for cheap but solid standard Italian food. Well, now they're tucked into the corner of a plaza in Mentor near Heinens. We walked in and hardly anyone there. I'm wary at that point, but we're there, so... It was sad. Really sad. All I can say. I'm not mad. Food was not the worst but it wasn't old Davitinos either. She had chicken Marsala. Rubbery chicken and watery gravy. I had the veal parmigiana topped with eggplant. I was really hungry so I ate half but didn't really taste anything. Server was an older woman and you could just tell that she knew that this wasn't gonna last for long. Just sad. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Biggest chicken parm I've ever seen! So good! Really nice staff, great service, food was delicious and they were able to accommodate our large, demanding party. Super nice to the marine members of the fam as well which we greatly appreciate. Try the Jarhead wine made by actual marines :) We will definitely go back!!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place one star is the place was clean, with a nice atmosphere (had we not been seated in the back, by the open doorway to the kitchen) and the marinara is pretty good. Otherwise, it would have received no star.   I love good Italian food. Having grown up on the fare in Little Italy and worked at the Greenhouse on Adelbert Rd., in Cleveland, owned by the Minnillo family, of the Baricelli Inn and currently Flour, before attending nursing school, I'd say I'm a fair judge.   This was my second trip to the restaurant. I wanted to give them a fair chance after the first trip was mediocre and I felt it must have been an off day for the place.   Both times, were were seated in the back, by the open kitchen, even though there were more ambient areas open. Both times, I noticed everyone with children were seated in the back, no matter how old your child was (mine was 13). Rather then disperse the noise and activity of children, they concentrate it, which makes for a very noisy dining experience when you add in the clanking from the open kitchen. I found this segregation very disturbing.   The other points that make this place fall way short is the unfriendly wait staff, the overpriced food--for the quality, and the lack of concern from the owners.  We ordered the Wedding soup and Calamari, to start. Calamari was very nice, but the wedding soup was overly watered-down. Most restaurants have their soup base made in the morning and as the day goes on, have to top it off due to evaporation reducing it. This is perfectly acceptable, but this was over-topped. The meatballs were flavorful, but he pastina in the soup was way under done. So much so, that they were like hard little grains. Visually, you could tell they were undone. I have no idea why the waitress didn't say something to the cook when handed the bowls. We were hoping the rest of the meal would be better.   Just an FYI--this place also charges $6.00 extra for a change in sauce and a \"sharing\" charge of $4.00 per dish, which I find outrageous, though we didn't plan on sharing, and I know the sauces are already made and sitting in steam tables, back in the kitchen.   When our meals came--Seafood Alfredo ($17.99), Jumbo Shrimp ($16.99), and Veal Parmigiana ($18.99)--all, except the Seafood Alfredo, came with a one-cup side of pasta with marinara. Also, all the pasta was way under-cooked. When my husband complains about it being under cooked, it is under cooked.   My son, who ordered the Jumbo Shrimp asked if he could have Alfredo sauce on his pasta, instead, was curtly told by the uninvested waitress that it would be an upcharge of $6-making the cost for that dish $22.99. I exclaimed, \"...for 2 oz. of Alfredo sauce?\" to which, Miss Warm answered, \"Do you want it, or not?\". Wow, how nasty can one be to guests? When his dish came, who would have though it would be only 6 medium, butterfly cut fried shrimp? Not jumbo sized at all.   My dish, the Seafood Alfredo, had about a quarter cup of minced, yes, minced scallops, with six small sized shrimp that were so under cooked, they were translucent. Needless to say, I put them aside and started eating the pasta, because I was starving. I planned on talking to Miss Warm when she came back around, but she stayed in the kitchen chatting with the cooks for the rest of our meal.  When she appeared to give us our check and boxes, I told her about the shrimp and pasta, she just stared at me for an inordinate amount of time, then blurted out, \"sorry\" before turning and walking away.   When I paid the check, the owner, Tina, didn't  ask how things were. in fact, she didn't even look at me.  All I can say is, this place is a very sad, sad, disappointment."}
{"text":"Food and service used to be really good at the old location until they moved. Now the owner has developed a real attitude and makes me feel like she's doing you a favor serving you.  We used to go all the time once every couple weeks. But it got so bad we quit. Now tonight we went back to give it another try we arrived 50 minutes before their advertised closing time and she refused to seat us.   they're closing almost an hour early on a Saturday night?  Maybe it's a sign of how bad business has gotten.  Save yourself the aggravation and go down the street to Mama Roberto's instead."}
{"text":"What a nice restaurant. The folks made us feel welcomed right from entering. Celebrating a cousins birthday was delightful! Appetizers were yummy. I had spaghetti with meatballs, the sauce was rich and delicious. One of our party had the seafood pasta, he was happy. The endless porkchop was tender with a side of pasta. We closed the place down..but were never rushed or hurried. Thank you for a really nice dinner. Jennifer, our server, was just as sweet as her Mom!"}
