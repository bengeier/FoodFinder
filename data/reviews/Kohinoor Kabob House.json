{"text":"If you like older made frozen and served for a higher than a normal price for Pakistani food.  This is the place to go to I am from Pakistan.  And i must say there is nothing authentic, nor is the food fresh, and for the prices i was very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great owners! Best kabob, everything is fresh, and the family is so great. Most definitely recommend for Richmond Hill"}
{"text":"Worst place to go. Bad owners and no customer service. Food is ok but not fresh. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant with friendly service. Love the chicken biriyani and the beef shami dinner. My only complaint is the front door full of hand and finger print smudges. The food here is made when ordered so expect to wait a little, its definitely worth the wait. The beef samosas are also very filling and tasty.  Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"my new favorite place. delicious kebabs, dal and curries. the food is fresh, hot, ready fast and the people are great. don't hesitate! i've been there 4 days in a row and counting... 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here to experience food of this kind for the first time, my wife wanted to come here but I kept saying no, she did call me a p@ssy, then here I am. It was empty no line up, more the reason I told her we should leave. She told me to man-up and I have the first tasting of something... special. I love their kabob, couldn't stop... I went on to destroy and toss my wife's plate in my stomach.... then I swore to myself that I would come back next week with or without my wife. They open late too"}
{"text":"... what the heck did I just eat. Got butter chicken, but they should rename it to something more accurate- water chicken. My buddy is currently experiencing upset stomach, and about to drop a water chicken. It was all water with 2-3 small chicken bits.  Very dissatisfied with the food. The service was unsatisfactory. Never. Ever. Are we coming here again. Unless we are thinking about cleaning out our systems."}
