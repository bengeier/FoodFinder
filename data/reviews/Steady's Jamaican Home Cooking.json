{"text":"I really enjoyed the jerk chicken with the peas and rice. It was very tasty and not too spicy.  Additionally, the customer service there was good.   I'd definitely give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken on a big plate of rice and peas is one of my favorite comfort foods. I stopped into Steady's this evening and on the menu was curry goat, oxtail, stew chicken and jerk chicken. The sign on the window also said they do a Friday fish fry which sounds delicious. I went with the jerk chicken this evening and it totaled $10 - this is a really great deal to me. The menu also featured a $5 lunch special that I would gladly take advantage of if I worked closer! The gentleman behind the counter also poured a generous amount of ox tail gravy on my rice which was very good and had fava beans and little tomato skins melting into it - yum! I look forward to going back for the fish fry or some oxtail."}
{"text":"I picked up some take out tonight for dinner.  I ordered the large oxtail dinner.  It came with rice and peas and the oxtail, the guy explained he didn't have any coleslaw today but would have it tomorrow.  I was fine with that.  There were 6 decent size pieces of oxtail and a ton of rice for $12.  My husband and I shared it for dinner and it was a good size portion.  There was a good amount of oxtail gravy and overall it was decent Caribbean food in the neighbourhood.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great tasting homestyle Jamaican food. The jerk chicken is a must try here. The owner is very friendly and the portions are a good size!"}
{"text":"Not the best but better than most and the price is what makes this such a good place.  The food is good, but not 5 star, and the owner Mr Steady is a pleasure to deal with and he will make you feel at home. My take out Jerk dinner with all the trimmings came to a whopping $8.00. Half the price of The Real Jerk. This place is a bit hard to find, it has a pape addres but it is off pape a bit. Corner plaza. Four stars because for what it is, it is good."}
{"text":"It's not bad, but I've had better.  Decent portion, large order is about $11-$14.  Cute little take out place next to a barber shop. The guy that served us seemed super happy and chill, singing to his music."}
{"text":"Got the large oxtail dinner for 12 dollars. Loved it. Good one to go in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken and oxtail. Chicken had a lot of flavour and not too much heat. Oxtail was also flavourful but not really my thing.  I'd have no issue with coming back here for more if I was looking for food in this area.  This place is also very welcoming, it makes you feel right at home.  The restaurant is on the northern face of a building that's at an intersection; it's actually accessed on the side street."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Jerk Chicken you will eat and oxtail gravy will make your toes curl....delicious!"}
{"text":"Oxtail I love there's nothing I don't love there  everything is bless thank u steady always great customer service feel right at home"}
{"text":"Got the jerk chicken with rice and peas. What steady's lacks in ambiance (pick up only) it does a good job in taste and value. The jerk chicken doesn't pack too much heat, has nice flavor, and is decent value for $10. A much better buy than the dirty bird across the street."}
{"text":"Small place, I liked the home cooking. Try the jerk chicken is really good and the other beef they have. It was my first time trying Jamaican food and it was really tasty. Very kind people and reggae music. Cool"}
