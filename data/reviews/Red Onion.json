{"text":"Just had a lovely lunch - had to split the spinach salad and a grilled veggie wrap with my partner as we have grown to realize a full meal each will be too much. Each was delicious and nicely presented. Our server was lovely - checking in regularly. We've been for breakfast (solid eggs and omlet fare) and dinners (the turkey burger with turkey bacon was a nice surprise) and every time, the staff has been wonderful and the food has been plentiful and tasty. We look forward to the long drives that take us past there!"}
{"text":"As of this review (February 2014), Red Onion has been open for a few months, and it has been one of the most consistently satisfying restaurants I've visited in the Chinatown area.

First of all, the decor and seating are well above average.  The booths are pretty spacious, the presentation of the restaurant is open and bright, and even the basement bathroom is cleaner than usual.

I have tried a variety of dishes at this place and have yet to be disappointed.  Another reviewer said he was confused why this restaurant served baked spaghetti.  He is obviously ignorant of Hong Kong-style food, because this restaurant is very obviously a \"Gong Sik Sai Tsan Tang\" (Hong Kong-style steakhouse/cafe).  They serve Chinese noodles and rice dishes, but also steaks, chops, baked casseroles, and other steakhouse-style food.

The first dish I tried was a Malay Curry Baked Chicken rice, and this dish has kept me coming back again and again.  It's a huge portion, there is a *lot* of chicken and rice, the curry is mildly spicy with a hint of coconut and enticing melted cheese on top, and the chicken is fried on the surface to make it crunchy, yet the meat is still soft and juicy.

I've also had the pork chops (good, not too memorable) and the steak with black-pepper sauce.  Both are good, just not as sumptuously portioned as the chicken dish.  The salt-and-pepper squid, listed as an appetizer, tastes good and is almost large enough to be considered an entree.  Even the free wonton soup is terrific, with large, firm, well shaped wontons, and the Hong Kong-style bubble tea is also well worth the extra $1 added for the meal.

This is the best Hong Kong-style steakhouse/cafe in the area that I've essayed.  Highly recommended.

(Update:  July 2014)

Unfortunately, it appears that Red Onion has gone out of business and has been replaced by a grill bar."}
{"text":"Portuguese chicken curry is excellent. Everything else is only so-so. 

I had the chicken so I was satisfied. My friends did not enjoy their dishes as much.  Have had friends go multiple times and tell me pretty much the same thing.  Only the chicken is decent."}
{"text":"With the opening of Red Onion, Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is no longer the only HK style western cafe in the Chinatown area.  And this is a good thing.  While 2- years ago, Hong Kong Bistro Cafe used to be the go-to place for such dishes as baked pork chop on rice and baked seafood rice, times have changed and there are many much better cafes in other parts of the city.  Unfortunately, until Red Onion opened, those of us who visited Chinatown had to suffer through the mediocrity that is Hong Kong Bistro Cafe.

Red Onion is far from perfect, but it is good.  The portion sizes are good and the dishes are generally quite flavourful.  We ordered the salted fish and chicken fried rice, baked shrimp on rice with cheese, baked pork chop rice, baked spaghetti bolognese with pastry on top (a weird combination), and salt and pepper squid.  The food arrived piping hot and was well-seasoned.  Service was friendly.  Prices were appropriate.  Between Red Onion and Hong Kong Bistro Cafe, I would choose Red Onion any day.  

A few things can be improved about Red Onion:
- the shells were left on the shrimp in the baked shrimp dish.  While I understand that the idea was that the shells were fried softly to allow them to be eaten along with the flesh, I did not prefer this taste.
- the menu is more limited than most other HK style western cafes.  Notable absences from the menu: Hainan style chicken, portuguese-style chicken curry, baked ox-tongue rice.  There was also no drinks section on the menu and so I was unsure if they served the usual favourites - HK style tea, lemon with warm coke, lemon with warm honey water...

In conclusion, a good HK style western cafe in this part of town.  I am glad we gave it a try tonight!"}
{"text":"Tried to make a reservation through yelp, since they have it on their page, but once I arrived at the restaurant there was no reservation. 

The service (the waitresses) are very nice and polite, but the chefs and managers are terrible. Food took almost and hour to come out and when it did, two plates were cold which were sent back hit the chef said it wasn't (it was ice cold). 

The food isn't good quality either and the rice used in the souvlaki is instant rice. After discussing our problems with the waitress, she gave us the managers phone number because he wasn't in (I wouldn't be either if this was my restaurant). 

The absolute worst was once we ordered our food, one member ordered a rack of ribs and 30 mins AFTER we told the waitress our order she comes back to tell us they don't have ribs! What type of restaurant won't tell customers they don't have an item on the menu when you order it? Major miscommunication from the kitchen to the waitresses.

Once we got home we gave the manager a call, once he called back, mid way through complaining he HUNG UP. 

Summary: Terrible food, comes out cold, nothing seems to be made in restaurant, management is terrible. 

0/5 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"This is probably the best HK style diner downtown - much better than my experience at Hong Kong Bistro Cafe. Everything is always clean, and service is prompt and friendly. I've been here a few times now, and have tried: 

Malaysian Curry - delicious! First time I ordered it, it was very salty, but spot on the second time around. 

French Toast - filled with a layer of egg custard and deep fried. Love dousing it in syrup; hits the spot.

Spaghetti Bolognese - yummy puff pastry included. Hearty sauce with a slight sweetness. 

Baked Pork Chop on Rice - really good! Cheesy and large portion of pork. 

Portions are great, and food comes as close to in Hong Kong as I think I'll find in this area. 4.5 stars, but I'll round up to 5 because they're new and show so much potential. 

Note: I would stay away from the bubble tea add-on for $1 - tastes more like flavoured water than anything."}
{"text":"So, I was excited to discover the inside looked a lot more appealing than the outside, and the food seemed like it would be good.  When the food arrived, there was a few black hairs clearly from the chef who wasn't wearing a hair net.  That grossed me out.  I would have ranked higher but now I sit here waiting for a new order as my college gets to eat his."}
{"text":"We'd just spent the night slammin some brews with good friends when we had to get out of town quick to get to work in montreal. Stopped for a quick breakfast before hittin the road on a monday morning. We all ordered the $5.95 breakfast special with choice of meat, eggs any way, home fries, toast, an coffee. Everything was cooked really fantastic except one serious mistake. My good friend Kate was really fixin for a runny yolk and ordered a sunny side up egg. They ended up giving her scrambled eggs but we didn't say anything because we were in a hurry. One star off for this. Other than that, bacon was crispy, sausage was quality, scrambled eggs were fluffy, potatoes were well seasoned. Waitress was sweet, bathrooms were clean though over air freshenered."}
{"text":"Drove 30 minutes to eat here - closed. No explanation, chairs up, ghost town. Could have posted something somewhere. A \"sorry\" on a piece of paper stuck to the door would have made me feel better. 
Won't be back unless they offer gas money."}
{"text":"Great services, great food, huge portions, what's not to like this place! The staff there is a middle age man who is always so friendly and happy, he reminded me of my family. I like the fact that they take credit cards for any amount and give me free soups for my takeout. Their food use good quality ingredients, it's very authentic Cantonese food. I have came back with my friends, it will be great if they can fix their takeout menus soon so that I can grab one home."}
{"text":"My son said his burger was ok. He liked the fries. Pop was flat. My daughter ordered chicken parmigiana meal but they brought her the sandwich. She ate it anyway. Was so drenched in sauce. My caesar salad did not have bacon. It was ok. My husband's calamari was a soggy mess. Ordered fettuccine alfredo with shrimp. They brought chicken instead but gave me shrimp on the side. Alfredo was bland. I had to add a lot of salt. Didn't like that they added baby carrots, green and yellow beans. I've never eaten alfredo with veggies like that.  My husband had the seafood fettuccine and was terribly disappointed. One of the cooks was so loud and annoying. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We were at Red Onion on a Saturday for quick brunch.We were on our way to Mono cliffs, checking out the fall colours.
The people there were friendly. The ambience of the was good, welcoming. We ordered the Veggie Skillet and Waffle with strawberry topping. It took us about 20 mins to get our food. The Veggie skillet was very good with eggs, mushroom, potato, bell peppers, cheese and toast. The food was simple, not too fancy but tasted good.
Do stop by this place if you are in the area, have some time to sit and have food. But not the choice, If you are looking for a quick grab and go."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite to eat.

I had the Triple Decker Chicken Club was so good with sweet potato fries.

Convenient location on King and Hwy.10.

Small restaurant but quality in the food for sure."}
{"text":"this joint looks unassuming from the outside, especially during blistery winter white out conditions. but once you step inside, you see the fireplace/tv brick wall, modern lighting fixtures, and cheesecake from the cheesecake factory enticing you to have breakfast dessert.

breakfast is served all day and the options are a plenty. the RED ONION SPECIAL comes with 2 eggs, home fries, toast, refillable coffee, and your choice of bacon/sausage/ham and a slice of orange to garnish. our inner school girls couldn't resist giggling at the girthy sausages. hehe. also laugh-worthy: the price, once you realize it's all just $4.99!!! what a steal.

the open concept kitchen surprisingly doesn't leave you completely greasy smelling and the staff are super friendly. i'm sure they weren't able to control the fact that fresh prince was on the air, but that added to my experience anyways."}
{"text":"This place is FABULOUS! Love the HK style food. We had the king mushrooms with spicy salt (yummy, though second only to the ones at Simon's Wok at Gerrard and Carlaw), braised egg tofu (the best thing I have eaten in weeks), sweet and sour chicken (super yum, great flavour and not cloying/greasy) and sauteed vegetables (perfectly cooked, delicious sauce). All of the sauces were beautifully made and not gloppy or overly salty. The vegetables, and there were plenty, were fresh and nicely cooked. This is our new Chinatown fave."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I go here quite often for lunch and let me tell you, the food is terrific. Its not greasy at all, always fresh. Meat is always good quality, not fatty or with gristle. I highly recommend their chow mein, rice noodle dish, and the beef/black bean sauce....one of the best ive had."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a first time visit and was completely impressed.
Super friendly server, quick to greet us and take drink orders and explain the special of the day.
Was pleasantly surprised with the nice decor inside.

We ordered: 1 special which included: 
*soup of the day, chicken barley which tasted homemade and was great. 
*Baseball steak with shrimps that came grilled to a perfect rare and a gravy like sauce that I could have drank!
*mixed vegetables which were fresh not frozen and not over cooked with a slight crisp 
*roasted potatoes which were probably the best roasted potatoes I've ever had in a restaurant. Golden brown and crispy on the outside and perfectly done on the inside.

1 grilled chicken dinner which came with the same as the special but my bf substituted veggies for extra potatoes.
*came with 2 perfectly cooked grilled chicken breasts.

Can't wait to go back. Highly recommend this little gem!!"}
{"text":"OMG Never again  !!... the owner very rude ! Don't believe all the positive reviews they are all fake  !!!"}
{"text":"Went here based upon Yelp reviews [I'm starting to think that is a bad idea].
  It's right next to a gas station and the view is depressing: dirty parking lot, sketchy people, houses that look like they should be condemned.
  Highlight: the waitress was very friendly and very efficient.
  Food: Utterly pedestrian \"diner fare\". Burger was gray, rock hard and bland. Fish was frozen [one bit even had freezer burn...yum!] and 75% batter. Fries were undercooked and soon went limp and cold.
 Price: Two mains, one appetizer and a coke was $45. No deal, by any standards.
 Don't waste your time pulling off Highway 10; just keep going."}
{"text":"Being very close to the flying club, I've come in here a few times to grab a quick bite with friends. They actually do a great job with lunch and breakfast food, have a new special every day but what I'm the biggest fan of here is the staff, they are amazingly friendly every time I've wandered in here even if it's just to get a coffee on the go. The food is slightly on the \"not so healthy side\" since it's a diner sort of place, but they do have a healthy section to the menu as well, so props for that! I've had their swiss burger and veggie wrap and both have been very satisfying! 

The place doesn't look like much from the outside being attached to a gas station and all that, but once you're inside you will realise that it's a very legit restaurant. Come here hungry too since they don't go light on the portions!!"}
{"text":"Always happy to find a new Asian restaurant on Spadina. Sad to see EPan go. Really weirded out by the men presented. I will never understand why a new resto goes for expensive printed, glossy, colored menus to start their lie with when they have nolt settled down to their clientele. the first review of this place which tells me its a Korean resto, okay, but still the offerings are totally weird: baked spaghetti with a pastry top in an Asian resto?? I had the black bean chicken and white rice lunch special for nine bucks, twice the price of other restaurant lunch specials on the strip. My friend had YoungChow Fried Rice, asked the server what was in it, answer: YoungChow, like it is some sort of ingredient. Luckily it was a big serving of friend rice with shrimp, but still way over priced. 
Been there once, would never return, as had the rest of the world, as we were the only ones there at lunch time."}
{"text":"When we first tried this place, the owner was super welcoming and it was always good vibes. Now the service is alright. And we only come for the cheap breakfast. Their special can get you your choice of 2 or 3 eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast and coffee, for about $6. And breakfast is served all day. I didn't love the potatoes, as they tasted like old deep fried oil, not a fan. There were only two servers serving that day and it was busy. It took awhile to get that second cup of coffee. Like I said, if you like a cheap breakfast, this is your place. They also serve lunch and dinner options,"}
{"text":"Food was great. But last night i went there the food was bit too salty."}
{"text":"I am very upset with my experience here today. I have been here a couple of times with my boyfriend and decided to share the love with my two best friends. The service was slow as it was busy but the waitress, despite being a friendly girl didnt pay us much attention and had to be flagged down more then once. My friend also found a hair in her omelette. I ordered the red onion skillet which sounded awesome , back bacon, cheese, veggies and hollandaise sauce, sounds yummy but lacked luster. I don't think i will be back, i am really upset with this experience."}
{"text":"Where to start , first off we had a family outing and decided to give this place a try after seeing some decent reviews on yelp.   Place was fairly busy so we had to wait about 15 min for a table once seated wait staff where very nice and helpful taking our order , couple of us picked breakfast and some lunch . About 20 min after we ordered we got told one of the orders a rack of ribs was not available , 20 min ? why did it take so long to be notified that they had no ribs ? Then it took another 20 min to get the rest of the orders. 40 min to get eggs and pancakes  and some burgers and one order of eggs had to be sent back because of being cold. While we where waiting you could smell food burning from the kitchen at one point it smelled like burning plastic , very nauseating . When our food was finally done  every dish came out individually while I was done my lunch my daughters burger just arrived. Insane. The food was bland , tasteless and dry. All food tasted  like cafeteria food not sure how this place stays in business. If your looking for a better place to eat go to McDonalds .  The waitstaff apologized and i don't blame them for this mess  , seems from what we where told the previous owners  sold the place and a new owner took over . I would say that have no clue what they are doing Stay away from this place is the last thing I'm going to say you've been warned.  0 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would...over priced, service was shit and so was the food!

We ordered eggs Benedict. It stated we could choose from \"benedict, florentine, blackstone (??) Or salmon\". Now normally Benedict is made with peamal bacon unless other wise stated... they also have the option of ordering a peamal sandwich so it is on the menu...yet it came with ham. I would not have ordered it if the menu stated that or I wpuld have asked to substitute. It also states it comes with 3 eggs... but my husband only got 2. The homefries were mush and the hollandaise was watery and tastes like shit 

The service was also horrible! She never came to see if our order was ok...or we would have said something, she didnt refill our waters at all, and my husband ask for a coffee refill when she brought the food but he never received it.

We are up this way all the time and I will never return!"}
{"text":"I think the breakfast is pretty good here. I like that there is a \"protein breakfast\" for those who are not big carb fans. If you are in the mood for chicken Souvlaki it is really good with a large portion size. The people are friendly and service it good."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative star I would.  Let me start by saying dont believe the positive reviews its got to be friends of the owner.  I came here despite the negative reviews about terrible service and less than average food but all the negative reviews are 100 % accurate.  I brought my family for lunch and I read they serve all day breakfast so we could all get what we wanted.

They sat us down quick enough and dropped off two menus breakfast and lunch which was odd enough for an all day greasy spoon.. She took our drink order right away but it took 15 mins to bring 4 out of the 5 drinks we ordered.  This is despite the woman who seemed to be the manager or owner walking right by us without so much as a smile or acknowledgment that we were there . FyI 2 coffees  one water one coke and she forgot a club soda.. No mixologist required  but regardless 15 mins and one thirsty customer..  

So I advise our waitress that we were in a bit of a hurry but I am always realistic so not like Im expecting my food in 10 mins.. but 40 mins later yes 40 mins later.. the same waitress comes to our table and says there is a problem.. the kitchen and order person are not communicating and they only have one cook.. so translation I your  waitress forgot to tell the one cook which by the way this place has an open kitchen so you can actually see the cook... I could have placed my own order without raising my voice.  BUT the kitchen had a communication problem.  So bottom line shes \"we cannot fullfill your order so if you guys leave we will give you a 40 % discount your next visit\" I was like really ? You are kidding right ?  She was like \"no Im not kidding... \"  I was beyond shocked I had to ask one more time \"you guys seriously cant make two breakfasts one burger and an order of chicken wings... ?  With a straight face shes says Yup !  

I got up and my family and I walked out to never return to this place again... 

This is an honest sincere review."}
{"text":"Second visit here and still not impressed.  I ordered Chicken Parmesean and it was over cooked.  The slice of mozzarella cheese drapped over with very little tomato sauce.  I choose to have it with Fettuccine Alfredo (pasta was standard)... but should be Spheggetti for tomato sauce.  Since it was Fettuccine I picked the sauce that would compliment the pasta best.  Bad mistake!   The sauce was horrible and made the entree from bad to worse.
My friend ordered their wrap and said it was alright.  She upgraded her fries to sweet potato fries.  Those were good and better when we asked for the Chipotle mayo dippping sauce.

First time was there, I ordered their Seafood pasta... I remembered it being alright.

The place is busy enough... I guess I am ordered their not so great items.   I see that their burgers and all day breakfast are a hit. 

Decor is nice and clean.  Staff is ok... Had to remind the waitress a couple of times for things... but it was  busy when we were there."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with my visit last Sunday. I come here all the time. Last Sunday I came in for dinner. Ordered a Greek salad it came out with a hair on the tomato. Polity sent it back. Then when my pasta came 7 minutes after the rest of my families good it was watery. Didn't think much about it. Went home and laid down as I wasn't feeling well. After 1-2 hour I came down with severe diarrhea and vomiting. I was so sick and didn't eat anything else that day. I also ordered a milk shake to go. My other family members didn't have any issues. Why was mine different? Because I sent my salad back? Was very disappointed. I don't think I will go back. Too sick and sop much recovery time. Taking days off from work!!!! Not happy !!!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Their Malaysian chicken would easily make this place a solid 3-star but there are many things to improve.

I have a soft spot for HK-style cafes and Red Onion has many things going for it; it just needs to work out a few issues. The place is way cleaner than most places in Chinatown, so this is a huge plus. The service is what you would expect: utilitarian. 

The food has some hits and misses. They have a daily special, which is where you'll probably be ordering from that gives you a  rotating special for the day and soup. By far, my favourite dishes are the MALAYSIAN CURRY and also the SPAGHETTI IN BOLOGNAISE  SAUCE. Their CREAM OF SHRIMP ON RICE was meh. Their BAKED PORK CHOPS IN TOMATO SAUCE was descent, if not a bit bland. I haven't ordered off their main menu, but they had some standard canto-style offerings.

What was a bit disappointing was their lack of selection of some noodle soup dishes and rice dishes. Where's my Portuguese Chicken on Rice?! If you go for their specials, unfortunately you can't choose your soup (or maybe you can, but I haven't tried asking). Their RUSSIAN BORSCHT is a bit heartier that I'm used to but still descent. Unfortunately their drinks are not very good. Don't bother ordering the BUBBLE TEA (even though it's only a dollar more) because it's basically watered down sugar water. The biggest disappointment, however, was the HK-STYLE TEA, which really wasn't good at all, not to mention really cold!

Overall, I'm a bigger fan of HONG KONG BISTRO CAFE on Dundas, but I'm hoping these guys can step up their game over the next few months."}
{"text":"For a $4.99 breakfast special you really can't go wrong. The service was pretty bad (my daughter has to ask for her water three times and we were given a butter bowl with used butter and leftover toast crumbs from someone else's toast in it...) but the value for the buck was pretty good."}
