{"text":"Great hole in the wall restaurant. Food was real good and the price was even better. Need to try it out!"}
{"text":"Their ginger chicken was so thickly breaded I don't think there was even chicken inside. And the sauce was tasteless and skimply applied. So dry. The vegetable chowmien was so greasy and slimy and the vegetables were over cooked. I couldn't even eat it. Spring rolls tasted not bad till you notice the slim it leaves on the roof of your mouth. Horrible food. If I could give a 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Chinese valley before. It's been sliding for awhile but tonight we ordered because of the price;cheap. When we phoned we were informed that the menu had changed. They had a reno a few months ago and we had ordered since then with the old menu. Anyway we said we would call back after we look at the new menu. They told us that they had changed the name and are now called \"Fortune One\" We went to the fortune one website and found that the group dinners had changed and the prices went up by a few dollars. Before we could choose our dishes with a 4.person meal. It is now set for every meal and no soup. We ordered anyway. The delivery has always been fast....it was again tonight.We were happily surprised at how improved the food was. Fresh hot and flavourful with the servings completly filling the containers. Ginger beef was crispy and syrup sweeter. Sweet and sour pork was all meat. Not alot of grissel.  Chop seuy very fresh. Dumplings fryed right and not to sticky or doughy. All the changes add up us being regular delivery customers again :)"}
