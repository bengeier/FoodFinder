{"text":"I attended the restaurant last evening to meet son a drink. I've been there before and the food is good, it's generally a family atmosphere. I was however very disappointed that there was three gentleman sitting at the bar cussing like truck drivers. They seemed to be regulars because they  chatted with the barmaid and a man in the kitchen. After hearing 10 to 12 F bombs and seeing dirty looks from other senior guests, I asked my waiter to ask them to watch their language, which they did for about five minutes and then the language began again. Needless to say I will not be returning there's enough other pub restaurants in the area to go to."}
{"text":"Beer-battered fish sandwich for LUNCH.  I ordered the same (2) months earlier.  Then the fish was soggy, heavy, oily.  Outside wasn't really crunchy.  I attributed it to low-volume fish sales, low oil temp...    Today, the 1st Friday in Lent:  I ordered the same dish was served.    'Tis the season, and if your fish isn't good on a Friday in Lent, when is it?  It wasn't always this way.  Years past, it was much better.  Other dishes ordered recently by me and my guests were better.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Always looking for a decent bar in this area. I really liked their food, ordered the fried shrimp and I was not disappointed. Really good! The menu has almost anything you could be craving! I went during their happy hour/drink specials and was happy with the prices. Smoke free is always a plus. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Nice, old fashioned neighbor sort of place, food is good and nicely done.  We had calamari for our appetizer and it was great, fresh and crispy with a great combo of seasoning.  Dinnerwas great and we really had a chance to relax."}
{"text":"Great place!! Don't let the lack of atmosphere fool you. This is great food and extremely cheap!! Say hello to Frank."}
{"text":"Surprisingly decent. Good appetizers and veggie burger. I would recommend the fried zucchini."}
{"text":"I HATE fried zucchini, but I will never go to Frank's and NOT order it. Fanfreakingtastic. Great food and the friendliest of service. You're likely to walk in and see the back tables put together for a group of friends. That doesn't happen in a place with bad food or service."}
{"text":"I would give the food 4 stars, but the service & atmoshere bring my overall rating down.  Food portions are large and for the most part everything tastes good.  Went there twice with a restaurant.com coupon.  Had problems with the bartender/waitress both times.  Same girl.  She wouldn't accept the coupon, saying that we didn't meet the terms....which we clearly did.  Had to argue with her to see a manager.  Both times she said there was no manager.  I told her fine, but she is not receiving a tip, and I will call the manager.  Then she accepted the coupon....with a HUGE attitude...one that she had the whole time.  Haven't been back since the second incident happened....and won't ever return.     It's very small and somewhat dingy."}
{"text":"I didn't get a chance to try the food due to the poor service. My buddy and I went there on a Sunday night to watch the penguin's game. The bar was not busy by any means. We had to wait probably 5 minutes before we were acknowledged by any of the staff. The vodka and coke I received was extremely weak. The tv's were nearly silent and we could not hear the game due to the older patrons talking about family, food, and drunkenly forgetting things. The bar was cold. After 10 minutes had passed in the game, my friend and I decided this place wasn't for us and we wanted to go somewhere else to finish watching it. The bartender asked if I wanted another drink and I said no thanks and paid my tab. My friend finished his drink and we waited about 10 more minutes with his debit card on the bar. No one came or noticed. So I put a $5 on the bar and we said good riddance. Service is everything to me and this bar did not deliver.  *just remembered that the bartender was pouring beers for other patrons and wiping the foam off the top with her hands. Luckily I was drinking mixed drinks."}
{"text":"For a neighborhood bar, the food is better than average. It was recently sold and the change is not for the better.  First, the drab and tired interior remains. I feel like I'm in someone 1970's rec room.  Second, the draft beer has no head. This means either the glasses aren't clean, the lines are dirty or they don't know how to calibrate the line pressure. Should I go back, I'll order a bottle.  Finally, the manager is loud and was berating one of the staff while behind the bar.  Not cool. Poor management and bad beer = I see a bad moon arising over Franks."}
{"text":"I used to live the place. Now.... no. I was there for lunch two weeks ago. When we walked in, there wsd no waitress. Waited 5 minutes then walked back to the kitchen to get her. She didn't know we came in because the radio in the kitchen wad so loud. Ordered stuffed hot pepoers..... the new cook couldnt find them. No coffee was made and they were out if iced tea. They hired idiots. Im done with that place."}
{"text":"I am one of the owners of Gab and Eat Restaurant in Carnegie and I love Frank's! Both of the owners are named Frank and they are both great guys! I love the steak special and the Reuben is huge and the corned beef melts in your mouth. Neighborhood bar/restaurant atmosphere with many regulars. And  we also love Fox News and have it on our TV at the restaurant. Lol. The White Russians are the best anywhere! Thanks for all your hard work and attention to quality."}
{"text":"Great little local bar/grill in Bethel Park.  Went there last evening and ordered the 6 ounce petit fillet.  It was probably the best I've ever had.  Cooked perfectly to medium rare with a side of fresh beans.  Hubby had the fish sandwich and it was a large portion and very good.  The service is friendly and prices are reasonable.  There is an extensive menu.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bar/restaurant in Pittsburgh and now that its smoke free, its even better.    The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but withhold your judgement until you've tried the food.  I recommend everything, but I love their fish sandwiches."}
