{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! It's a bit pricey but so worth it. The food is excellent and the service is amazing!!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is actually pretty good but in the two times dining in, the service was very slow and the orders were wrong. As for carryout, don't bother. I have ordered 5 carryout orders and all were either wrong or not even submitted to the kitchen when I arrived 30 min later. This is one of the only sushi places in the area but I drive to Sakana instead due to the poor service here. Bummer when the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Traveling on business, we decided to try his place.  Service was very good as was the meal.  Had the steak, chicken and shrimp with fried rice.  The meal was prepared and cooked perfectly and the portion size was excellent.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. We eat here at least once a month because it's the best sushi we've found in Phoenix. 

Try the Firecracker!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Japanese steakhouse in the Phoenix area. With Japanese steakhouses, it seems like there can be a lot of inconsistency with the cooking abilities of the chefs and this ah so location is spot on. Their lunch special is also reasonably priced. I'm not big on sushi, so I can't really comment on that. Their customer service is on par with most other Japanese steakhouses."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years and it is always consistently a great place to go.  The portions are large, everything is fresh and the staff is very friendly.  They always seem to remember us and that's an added bonus.  We used to only go to the teppanyaki tables, but we've grown to love sushi and now sit at the regular tables instead.  My daughter always picks this restaurant to celebrate her birthday.  She's 20 now and we've been going to this location since she was about 6!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, Chef was good, waiter added 21% tip for himself for a party of 4 since its Valentines weekend. We tipped the table chef when he finished cooking.
 This was not posted on the menu, doors or anywhere in the building."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place..the food is always awesome! It is above and beyond all the 'other' ah-so's in the valley !"}
{"text":"I am disappointed with my experience at this location tonight. We had a reservation for 6:30, called 45 minutes ahead to confirm, and one person in our party showed up early to check in. The host stand was incredibly disorganized and clearly did not communicate with each other. After waiting an hour to be seated we were told they were clearing a table for us only to have the other host begin seating other guests. People who arrived after us with later reservations were being seated before us. After it was clear we were not going to be seated anytime soon we had to give up and leave. I have visited this location a number of times, but I am amazed at the disorganization on a busy day such as Mother's day. I will not visit this location again."}
{"text":"We love this place.  We are always greeted by the owners who have always been very nice.  Sushi is, in my opinion, best in town.  I recommend the Spicy Tuna Hand Roll.  They are a little pricey but it's worth it.  They have been in business since I was in high school in the '90's which, for me, says a lot."}
{"text":"By far this is the best sushi ever! The service is also great. We drive all the way from central Phoenix  there just to enjoy some quality food. Last night we sat where they serve teppanyaki and our chef cooked our food to perfection and offered us a great show as well. Don't forget to tip your chef if you sit where they cook teppanyaki. Our friend had his birthday and we asked for the birthday dessert. That song was the real deal! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. The \"Climax\" roll is amazing. I go there every chance I get when I am in the area. Recommend going during lunch or happy hour otherwise like all other Sushi places prices go up significantly."}
{"text":"I feel like maybe it was just me last time I ate here. I went today and it was great! The atmosphere is okay along with the service! But you cant beat the happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are good, service sucks! I've been here multiple times and unfortunately every single time the service is slow and uninviting. The most recent time we were seated at the table closest to the host stand and we sat there for 20 minutes before the host finally came up to us and asked if we had seen our server. In the meantime the manager had walked by us multiple times and even stood at the host stand facing our table. Although he clearly knew we hadn't been greeted yet he continued to stand at the host stand mingling with his staff members. Again, food and drinks are great, service not so much."}
{"text":"The sushi was exceptional as usual. The saki was warm and buttery. The atmosphere is warm and relaxing. A great place to spend the evening with friends. Thank you."}
{"text":"Food is extremely salty. The california roll has too much mayo. I cant sleep my chest hurts from all the sodium. Seems like during happy hour the chef just doesnt give a shit about how the food looks and tastes. Service is awful too, sat and waited for 20 min after meal to get our check. All around a shitty experience. Feels like im having a heart attact"}
{"text":"Ah So's sushi is definitely good; although I opt for Sakana's (right down the road) as being better by a slim margin.  The teppanyaki (sp ?) is always excellent at Ah So's; and in this regard I have to give them the benefit of the doubt and go with a five star rating (call that a 4.5, actually, but I don't see a marking for that.  Really nice place all around, but it is just a tad bit on the pricey side.  Of the three locations on the NW side of town, I would have to say that the original one at 61st Av/Bell Road is the best.  Call that one a 5-Star and the others a 4-Star."}
{"text":"I stopped here in the afternoon for lunch and ordered their seaweed salad and ikura nigiri sushi. The seaweed salad was tasty but I had issues with the ikura nigiri that was served to me. 
  The seaweed that wrapped my nigiri was not fresh because the texture was gummy and the salmon roe on my nigiri tasted like bleach. The taste was so unpleasant that it immediately sent me to the restroom after my meal. 
  Do they use chlorine dioxide on their seafood here?...yes..no...maybe so?...well, I definitely won't be back here again"}
{"text":"I went with my only friend who will get sushi with me (the rest of my friends are wusses).  We had actually wanted to go to Fresh Wasabi, but they were closed for some reason.  So we went to Ah-So and I'm so glad we did.  If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.

I've had good sushi before.  But this stuff was legen- wait for it- dary.  We went three times now, and I've not had one single item that hasn't been extraordinary.

Unfortunately, I didn't get a menu, and I'm having a hard time remembering exactly what we've ordered.  I remember the Booty Booty roll, the dynamite roll, a tempura roll with cream cheese and salmon, and a second climax roll.  Something else with jalapeno that was wonderful.

We asked the very nice waitress for suggestions and she did not disappoint.  The presentation was just beautiful.  I'm so glad to find a great sushi place on the west side of town!"}
{"text":"This is the original.  Do not be fooled by other imitation chain Ah So's.   Quality food with staff that remembers you from previous visits.  We have been going here for over 10 years and are still big fans."}
{"text":"Our actual waitress was wonderful and the food was great. But some lady in some damn leather shirt that seemed to be some kind of manager come over and grabs mine and my friends checks and mine was paid with cash, mostly $1 bills and she had the nerve to count the bills right in front of me. It was rude and I felt like she didn't trust that I paid the full price even though I left a $5 tip. The restaurant itself os great but that really did tarnish the experience."}
{"text":"Base on 3 visits: (all at the sushi bar for dinner)
Pros: 
Younger guy at the sushi bar is super fast and knows customer service.

  Cons:  I guess its a Trend  here but I get the feeling servers are always trying to rush you out of there and with little to no customer knowledge. 

But so far, one of the top places in town."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Felt as though staff rushed us.  Didn't even complete our meal. Rolls were loose and fell apart before we could get them to our mouths. We've had sushi in the best and also most unlikely places and had better. Will not return."}
{"text":"I'm not going to hold back so excuse my poor grammar- everything about this place blows. Smells funny, quality is poor, the staff is just ok and wtf is with the pond fountain. Blows."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to try this place. I drove by for many years and finally stopped in to try it. The atmosphere is not very welcoming. When you enter, there is a long hall and restrooms, it feels very cold. We walked in and waited to be seated. We stood there waiting a minute before the hostess acknowledged us. The hostess asked how many and instead of seating us answered the phone. She stayed on the phone for a few minutes rather than asking the person on the phone to hold. While waiting we decided to leave. This was our first impression on this restaurant. I'm glad we didn't waste our time there. They don't deserve our money. Horrible, horrible service and horrible atmosphere. We will never return and spread the word. It's not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"This place is Ah-So good and tons of fun. I think it's a little more expensive than it should be but I still go every few months or so. Great sushi and good food."}
{"text":"Food is ok . Place smell bad. I order filet steak. I want medium well . But meat is all burn out."}
{"text":"By far the best ah-so around. We've tried just about all of em in arizona.  The miso soup is outstanding here.  It's an art form here and just an appetizer at the other ahso's in AZ.   All the way through the staff here is fantastic and always on point.   Once again my waters stay full and my stomach is happy for days.   We love it here"}
{"text":"If you want sushi, happy hour every day, an inexpensive this is the place to go. College students --you're welcome. Quality is good for the price."}
{"text":"I do keep coming back here...can't call it 5 stars but it's definitely a good place.  Rolls are a (very) healthy size...sometimes a bit too big but hey I'm not complaining.
I'd say I'm a big fan of the spicy tuna roll here (with the shrimp tempura too).  They have a lot of fun choices on their menu so that's definitely a plus.  If only they lowered their prices on the tepanyaki, i'd consider going for that.  Nonetheless, great happy hour that they've got, especially with that spicy tuna roll. Oh, and the guy who makes the sushi is awesome.  He actually listened to me when i said \"A LOT of extra ginger\" and brought me an entire plate...let's just say I was a happy camper because just about all the other sushi restaurants keep bringing puny little portions and charging extra....so definitely extra bonus points to that guy!"}
{"text":"Had to go check it out again ....food is amazing so worth another try ....seemed to be cleaner and of course the food was out of this world ....  Vegas roll to die for as well as the filet and shrimp !!  Will be back again soon ....no doubt !"}
{"text":"We had a late lunch here the day after Christmas. Staff was very friendly and service was great. Sushi was fresh and large portions. If I ever return to the Phoenix area I'll be there again."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Reminded me of a hibachi place in New York we used to go to very often, apparently it's called teppanyaki out here. Chefs are friendly and fun, everything comes out cooked perfectly, always juicy and delicious and well seasoned. Their ginger sauce is excellent as well. Only issue is the soda tastes flat, but come before 6 and take advantage of happy hour specials. $5 sake bombs, and not just a single. Enough for about 4 bombs worth, with leftover beer (they give you the larger bottles)."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here I leave happy. The happy hour sushi menu has great selection and is very reasonably priced and is supper yummy . The appetizers are great too"}
{"text":"The food is to die for. With that being said, the rest of the experience was kind of strange. Place needed to be cleaned to start with, and the staff was extremely inattentive. The price was outrageous for dinner (same dishes are half priced for lunch). The cook was very odd, doing a fake accent the whole time that was over the top to the point of annoyance. If I'm going to be paying high end prices, there are several other places in the valley where the money would be better spent."}
{"text":"This specific location is my favorite place to eat.  The food is outstanding and the owner has never failed to greet our table.  For the record I do have a horrible addiction to sushi and they do not disappoint.  The newer locations are good but I prefer the \"hole in the wall/ma and pa\" places and this location just feels more authentic to me.  We have been having my birthday dinners here for the last 17 years and that tradition will continue!"}
{"text":"I was not a fan of their food.  Overpriced for the quality, which was so-so. We got the garlic edamame and sushi rolls.  The sushi was not impressive.  The alcoholic beverages were also so-so, I even ordered liquor in my drink that was not house.  I would recommend finding another place if you are a sushi lover, it may be better for people who want non-sushi."}
{"text":"I love this place and they've got half the price specials for lunch and ironically my husband and I are already eating as I get an alert to say come eat. The moment we walk in, they got great customer service, the place is nice and clean, they always have great attitudes and it's a very fun atmosphere and we came right as they open and everything is perfect. We are the first one here."}
{"text":"Dear Reviewers reading,
I thought this place was amazing! it was so cute and little and has a lot of the best sushi and Japanese foods. I had a hard time finding Yakisoba here in the valley but this place makes it and it was so delish! My dear that went with me order tons of sushi and he knows good sushi since that's all he eats, he loved it and said it was very good. We both loved our foods and the service was so nice. We had a waitress and she made sure everything was right. Even with a big table and a couple other tables full she still made her rounds in time and helped serve everyone."}
{"text":"Took a friend here 'cuz she really wanted teppanyaki for her birthday, and the online reviews said this was the best place.  All three of us were very happy and satisfied.  One of or party is vegetarian, and ordered the Mango Roll and Vegetable Tempura, and also received some of the fried rice (and the chef's showmanship) anyway.  Our birthday lady ordered the Filet Mignon and Lobster, and I ordered the Steak and Shrimp.  From the Miso soup, salad, and through the entrees, we loved the flavors and the attention to preparation.  Portions were very generous, and two of us took home leftovers (yum!).  Highly recommend this little restaurant that looks rather humble in its strip mall location (behind the Black Bear Diner, 61st Ave and Bell Rd), and whose inside experience is wonderful."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE this place... 
Great service.. Great food!!!
Never needed to ask for a refill! That's great, as we had 4 boys 1 girl and 2 adults... 
We WILL be back for the yummy sushi and amazing customer service.. 
Thanks so much Ah-so!!!"}
{"text":"There aren't many good sushi places in glendale, az, but there sure a lot of sushi places within almost every other block around bell rd. 

Went here with a friend for lunch. It was completely empty. We were the only one's there. We ordered a roll, but the sushi quality wasn't that amazing. The fish wasn't at the right temperature and had too much sauce on there. It was just mediocre. 

The highlight of our lunch was that they have turtles in this fake stone pond. I saw something from my periphery and i pointed, my friend turned around and literally screamed, jumped out of her seat. I laughed so hard. The turtle came out of the water and was walking towards my friend by her seat, on top of the rock. The turtle was about 1 ft away from her. 

Tame your turtles! or you'll SCARE away your customers! lol"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! We had Terry as our chef,  super friendly,  very talented! Food tasted great and our 10 year old had a great time and loved her food. My husband ordered steak and he cooked it perfectly. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever and the food is always good. My only complaint is that is always smells so dusty and dirty when you first walk in."}
{"text":"Super fun! We got the couple dinner with shrimp and filet. The filet was really good. Terry was wonderful and cooked it a perfect medium rare. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very good. Sushi was awesome. Portions are big. Pretty clean and friendly. Good sushi roll selection. Half bar/ Half Benny Hana style restaurant.  Ahhhh-sooooo!  Wudjew call me?"}
{"text":"This was a good choice. The food was plenteous and well prepared. The chef was funny and responsive. Good place for lunch."}
{"text":"I got a caterpillar roll and a California roll. Both were standard, but still good. I would definitely come back for the strawberry mochi ice cream though!"}
{"text":"I love their sushi! Every time I go in I am very pleased with my food and the service. I have recommend this place to a handful of friends and I will continue to recommend to everyone. Keep up the good business!"}
{"text":"Did I eat here tonight?  No.  Have I in the past? Many times.  I was reminded of how great this place is after a terrible experience at the north Scottsdale Benihana.  Please forgive me Ah-So, I will never again make that mistake stepping out on you."}
{"text":"Good price for a small joint. Not your normal tasting sushi. Very tasty. Very busy make sure you go early"}
{"text":"I could literally eat here every day! I've never had a bad meal or bad service here...nuff said!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. My family (extended included) have been coming here for years and it's never disappointed. The School Bus roll and the Vegas roll are our favorites. The teppanyaki is always delicious as well. The atmosphere is so fun and is great for casual dining or for a special event. The staff is always very friendly and seem to remember us. Always a great time and always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Love this place.. Most of the chefs are really entertaining and they cook the food really well. We usually get the chicken and shrimp and also the filet and shrimp... It's always been really good. The owner also usually comes by to make sure the food is good as well and to thank us for coming."}
{"text":"Ah-So is always a fun dining experience! It's good for all ages and almost every occasion. If you go, you must sit at one of the teppanyaki tables. Watching the chefs cook your meal while telling jokes and performing 'tricks,' is something the kids will love! 
This location is specifically good for children because there is a water feature inside the restaurant. The roughly 20 foot long waterfall has real koi swimming throughout. 
I believe this location was the 'first' in the Phoenix area as well. It looks fairly old from the outside, but don't let that sway you. Go inside and order the shrimp! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Good food and decent service but the Hibachi side is very pricy and the calamari appetizer was tough and dry. Over all though, it was a nice time but wish they had more of a dessert menu especially for birthday celebrations. 
I went here many years ago and they have done some very nice remodeling since then."}
{"text":"The best teppanyaki in the valley. It's not too fancy, it's a bit hole in the wall. but the food is great, the people are friendly, and the service is top notch.  I'm not a big sushi person so I can't really comment there, but the teppanyaki is fantastic, a great show, and not super formal or pretentious like benihana."}
{"text":"Ive been here so many times... I usually get the untouchable roll (#32) and a Mai Tai. Favorite sushi place, atmosphere is nice and so is everyone who works here."}
{"text":"I start off by saying sushi is really good! The prices are amazing even without happy hour. But the inside is just dark and disgusting. Put some new lights lighten the place up a little. Chairs are old and so are table I say the invest in new ones. Also wish they had outside tables!"}
{"text":"We were having a family birthday with 24 people, they were the only place that would take the reservation! They made the experience for us amazing. The owner is amazing, she also owns Hayashi's in Surprise, so is the staff, and the food was amazing. We will definitely keep them in mind for all of our future big reservations!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm, so dericious! they are always so nice, quick & our dinner is always fast. Happy hour is amazing & affordable!"}
{"text":"First this location is NOT a part of the other 2 or 3 chain locations that share this name. This Bell location is a crown jewel all on it's own! This review is for this location only.

One of the Best sushi spots ever. Great food all around. They have all kinds of sushi, raw and cooked, specialty rolls. Delicious shrimp fried rice. Miso soup is always on point. Egg rolls so tasty. 

If your not really on board with sushi, no problem the have a Hibachi side where they cook the food in front of you. It is artsy, pretty and fun you can try to catch food with your mouth. Great spot to have a get together with friends or coworkers and family too.

They have a a little koi fish pond inside in the middle of the restaurant with fish and live Turtles where you can throw coins in and make a wish. 

Always friendly good fast service, they hook it up with the size portions they give you on either sides of the room.

Real Japanese sushi and beer.
Good happy hour too"}
{"text":"They do it all here, teppanyaki, sushi and a full bar.  One of my favorites is a salmon skill roll, these are hit or miss depending on the itamae.  It was spot on today.

The restaurant It is a little dark inside, but the staff is attentive and the presentation added to the experience.  They do a good job all around.

Rounding up the stars."}
{"text":"We have been regulars at the Bell Road location for 8 to 10 years, great place with wonderful food.  Not the fanciest place but the food is better than the Happy Valley or 75th Ave. locations. They have bigger rolls, friendlier atmosphere and can't beat the value. Great lunch and weekday Happy Hour menu!  All Ah-So restaurants are individually owned, this is the original, and Michael and Lee never fail to extend a warm welcome!"}
{"text":"Ah-so was just so.  We enjoyed our lunch and it was nice to sit next to the little pond.  But next time, for money, I'd pop down the street to Sushi Catcher.  The fish is fresher and they have fresh wasabi."}
{"text":"Great Sashimi and we had a really fun chef. The waterfall and turtles are great for the kids."}
{"text":"The Teppanyaki is fantastic and how can you go wrong with Saki Bombers!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and the staff had me seated right away. They had a great selection and when I orders (California roll/ chicken teppanyaki) is was quick and delicious."}
{"text":"Wait was longer than i was told over the phone so basically they do not take reservation. Hibachi dish was great. Salad was good but soup was too salty. I think it's a little pricy for what you get. Hibachi dinner for 4 of us was $120. I may explore other Hibachi restaurants before we go back to this place."}
{"text":"We really wanted to try this place out so we stopped by on a Saturday afternoon. We asked to be seated at the hibachi grill and both the host and hostess barely acknowledged us. We didn't know what we were supposed to do so we just stood in the waiting area. Finally, the host sat us down at 2 awkward seats that were in between 2 hibachi tables. So we literally did not know which one we were even a part of. To make matters worse, a few mins later a different waitress came over and yelled at us saying she needs those seats. We told her the host sat us there so she just rolled her eyes and left. At that point we realized that coming here was a huge mistake so we got up and left. We will be looking for a more organized Hibachi place."}
{"text":"First off I want to start by saying I've had some pheonaminal sushi in places like LA and San Diego and Seattle. My expectations with any sushi restuarant in Arizona is going to be set a lot lower. My friend and I went to this Ah So. I've been to the chain ones and they were ehhh. So when she told me that this had different owners and I should check it out, I did. First off, it was not bad sushi at all. I would give this a 4 stars if I was holding it up to Arizona standards of sushi but this review is going to be compared to the overall sushi that I've had.
 
It was a Saturday night around 9:50pm and barely anyone was there. It surprise me. We put in a drink order, my friend got a tequila sunrise and I got a sake bomb with sopora. When they brought us the drink, our sever spilled a little bit....more than a little bit,  on the table. I can tell he was green. He did bring napkins so we can take care of the spill. We order shrimp dumpling and gyzo and it was fresh. We had some rolls and they tasted fine. Mediocre but fine. Better than the other Ah So's but not as good as Sakana. 

The HH menu allows you to pay cheap prices for things that you would want to try but did not want to pay full price for. It's a good place to catch up with friends and go on a date."}
{"text":"We have been going to ah-so for years. We have always liked it but it is even better with the new owners. The owners are very hands on. The remodel makes it feel more spacious. Sushi is fresh and everything I have tried on the menu has been fantastic. Not one bad thing to say about this place. Oh, the filet is the best in town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went because we had a coupon for their sushi. We have been to the Ah-So on 75th and Bell and fell in love! Maybe we just went on an off night for this location, but I think we just had higher expectations because of the location on 75th. The waiter was nice but didn't seem to really care. When we were ordering I asked what smelt egg was and he had to go ask and came back saying it's fish eggs. I said okay nooo thank you for that! And I asked a couple more questions about the menu, asked his favorite, went over a couple more items that had the eggs and again said I didn't care to have anything with the eggs. Anyway, I ordered the booty booty roll because it didn't have the words smelt egg in it. (Love their roll names though) and when he brought it and left, I went to grab one and saw little red balls all over it. Asked the waiter and he said oh those are like the smelt eggs. In the menu it calls it something that started with an M but nothing about an egg... So I was just curious as to how he would let me order something that would have the eggs on it after we spent so much time making it clear I didn't want eggs. Haha I wasn't upset, just sad I didn't get to eat it. Wouldn't go back, I'm sure if I had a different server it could have been different. Not mad at him either, maybe he didn't know the menu well enough to tell me. And the place smelt like boiled hot dogs from their little pond lol. Nice people there, but not enough to come back."}
{"text":"This was one of the most unorganized restaurants I have ever seen, we had a reservation at 6:30 and left the restaurant at 7:20 after not being seated. Several groups with reservations later than ours were sat before us, and the hostess had no idea what was going on. Several people waiting had similar situations and it was compete chaos. I love the food and experience here normally, but I will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, amazing service! I can't get enough! The sushi is on point and teppanyaki chefs are very entertaining!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! They have good specials so it's even easy on the wallet. Nice ambiance as well with the turtle pond. Take your family here!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night. 
Kind of a dive, but I say that because it is older and it shows. If you like fu fu up-scale teppanyaki, go somewhere else.
If you like great,  food, drink and service go to this location.
Of the five of us there we had the filet combos with scallops, chicken and shrimp. 
Everything was excellent. 
The service was amazing. She filled our non-alcoholic beverages before we even noticed they needed filled. Our adult beverages were delivered quickly after ordering. She was very busy, but I never felt neglected. 
I have been another location with the same name, but not same owners. I did not know that when I made reservations and only picked this one to come to because it had more and better Yelp reviews (Thanks everyone!). Our chef was named Cheko(?) and made sure we had a great show and awesome food. 
I have one complaint...
They brought extra shrimp to the table (I think...extra) and he cooked and tossed them to the other diners who ordered the the combo without shrimp.
When it comes to food, DO NO share my portions with someone else. Even if they are extra, that is NOT my perception. Either knock it the %#$@ off or give me a scallop that I did not order to even it out. LOL ;-)

However, my buddy made the same comment after we left. So I there is some angst behind the humor. Next time I guess I'll order scallops and get a free shrimp.

We all said we would be back, and we will."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi, been here many times for my wife. We only got the cucumber rolls but it was decently priced and tastes really good.

Service is always quick and pretty friendly.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Food and entertainment was awesome! Great birthday lunch for my bestie! I had the filet mignon ...it was amazing. I will be back the next time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"My fam and I love this Ah-so THE BEsT, out of all of them. It is small and inviting. We like the sushi here better than other locations and the food seems to be better here, too. mmmm, mmmmm, mmmm... craving it now."}
{"text":"The sushi and service is great! I was able to get a table for 2 right when I walked through the door and the waiter was prompt. It only took about 8 minutes to get our sushi and it was fresh and filling. I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed, and I will most definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for sushi and also Teppan Yaki. It's small and local and not as fancy as Beni-Hana, but the food is also a helluva lot better. If you want local, non-chain, good sushi, this is the place. It's not super-cool on the inside but they have the important stuff right: excellent food and good service the vast majority of the time."}
{"text":"After initially trying their location on 75th Ave., my family and I came to this location near 59th and Bell. It is a small location with 4 teppanyaki grills, approximately 5 tables, and a sushi bar. 

There is a large fountain running in the middle of this restaurant and if they ever decide to expand, they may want to get rid of it. However, it was a nice feature that entertained my 4-year-old niece throughout dinner. Even though the decor is not modern and inviting, the place is clean and decent in appearance.

If you plan on dining here during peak times, I encourage you to plan ahead and make reservations. It fills up quickly and they do not have much of a waiting area (most people were sitting outside on the benches and it was very cold). 

The food was delicious and the service was very attentive. They serve miso soup for all dinners, even for sushi orders. I enjoyed every bite of each sushi piece. It tasted well rolled and fresh. My mom doesn't care for sushi at all, but really enjoyed the teppanyaki chicken. For all three of us and one beverage, it ended up being approximately $60."}
{"text":"Great service. Great sushi. Very good prices and a good happy hour menu. We didn't sit at a chefs grill table, but next time I think we will. We saw them bust out some crazy moves, including flipping an egg into his front pocket."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Daniel made a special roll for us. Exactly what we were looking for, with seared blackened tuna, cucumber and other awesome flavors!!! So good!!! Had appetizers, soup, rolls and dessert."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav sushi joints if not THE favorite. This one is wayyyy better than the big one off of 75th ave and bell. We always get seated right away here and drink orders taken promptly. Our food comes out quick and is so flavorful. I usually get a vegas roll and fried rice with a side of shrimp sauce My sister gets a few different rolls as well. The wine is good here too."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out with a group of friends and enjoy sushi and a SUPERB price.  The rolls were big and only $3, I wish this place was closer to my side of town because I'd be there every weekend.  The waitress was so friendly and down to earth, I cant emphasize enough how great the food was and the price of everything made it THAT much better!  

I'd go again!"}
{"text":"CHEAP Tepanyaki lunch.  My kids were thrilled by the show.  They could not do it gluten free except in the kitchen.  Would not be good for a vegetarian that doesn't want the food to mix on the table.  Would go again.  The place was almost empty though?!"}
{"text":"We're always looking for a new teppanyaki place, this unfortunately isn't one we will be dying to go back to again. 
First off the hostesses, managers, servers were all phenomenal, from the second we walked in we were impressed with how inviting and kind everyone was. We were off to a great start. 
Where they really dropped the ball was the teppanyaki chef, while the food was good. His presentation was lacking. We brought our 9 year old niece to experience teppanyaki for the first time and she was bored. He did the volcano with the onions and flipped the eggs into his hat but that was the extent of it. 
The whole reason to go to a teppanyaki grill is for the experience, to be wowed and we weren't."}
{"text":"The golden spicy avocado is a must try.  #36 on the special list, great to share and very filling."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Had to get up to get my own water refill, wasabi, & ginger. Management was watching the Laker's game the whole time we were eating dinner. Our waiter disappered for 40 minutes. When we asked the bus boy for more water he refused to get it. I waited 40 minutes for my 6 pieces of sashmi. 
Overall management is out to lunch. Servers are rude and easily annoyed. 
The only positive was Chris behind the sushi bar. I hopes he moves onto a better establishment where he will earn more money!! 
Do NOT go here!!!"}
{"text":"Place was ok... .Our cook wasn't very into , and not as much fun as the others. 

Everybody that ordered steak at the table ordered it medium, however everyone got theres well done.   So annoying to pay that much for the food, to get your steak charred like that."}
{"text":"While I wanted to try some place new this time out I had to compromise. The Happy Valley location was brought up and I begged and pleaded to come to this location instead I am really glad we ended up back here again. There was 5 of us including my daughter and niece that cant sit still for 5 minutes. We sat down for Teppanyaki and started everything off with sushi. I still highly recommend the Samurai drink its made nice and strong just how I like it! So this place is now owned by one of the chefs and his gorgeous wife. I cant remember their names I'm really bad at that after some alcohol. I can however remember food and I had THE best roll EVER!!! It was a chefs special and it was the RED roll sooo frign good. Spicey and not sure if I'll have any other roll again. It was gorgeous see pics. I will not go to another Ah-So location this is it the best folks! It may not be huge like the one on Happy Valley but it will leave a great taste in your mouth!!

My niece of 8 yrs loved it by the way she had never been!"}
{"text":"So I show up with some friends at 9:48 fully expecting to not be served, considering they close at 10. Not only did they seat us and serve us, they were friendly, the food was amazing, and they honored a coupon that we didn't even have printed out. Great Sushi, Great Service, and the lady who works there is really pretty."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews - I would have loved to leave a great review for the atmosphere & experience as many others have.
I just can not- walked in durning happy hour .
Service took forever.
Had to walk out - establishment needs to work on customer service here."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at this location, I understand they aren't all connected. However I will say this one is by far the best Ah-So I have visited. My sons and I did the teppanyaki for dinner and everything was fresh and the show was great. Definitely will return"}
{"text":"Five stars is not something that happens often. However we had a great date night here. Sitting at the teppanaki table we got jokes, showmanship, and amazing food. Real deal. Delicious fresh food and wonderful chef."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go and eat.  I could honestly eat here 3 times a week, getting the Vegas roll and I'd be a happy camper.

I always take all of my friends here if they've never heard about it and we always go during happy hour.  It's insane the volume of food and drinks you can get for pratically pennies.

I'm very picky about my sushi places and this is hands down the best place I've been to and I've been to sushi in Boston, LA, Hollywood, Las Vegas, and Miami.  You'd think desert sushi would be gross because it's not as fresh but this place is even better then the stuck up scottsdale restaurants."}
{"text":"Well if there was zero I would give that as my rating. Just had an 8:30 reservation and showed up and they told us it would be a 20 minute wait. What is the point of a reservation?"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and delicious. They serve just enough to have a few left overs to enjoy the next day. The prices are reasonable for the quality. The sushi bar is great and the chefs are really friendly. 

All the visits I've had to Ah So, they've never had the fountain running or working. They should fix it."}
{"text":"We celebrated my son's 21st birthday here last week.  The teppanyaki is so fun and delicious. I like that they are open until 10pm even during the week, that gives people  like me that work in food industry a chance to go eat out after our shift.  

The decor is a little tired, hole in the wall - but not horribly off putting.  The service is friendly and fast, and the Sake Bombers are a great deal.

I haven't tried the sushi yet, as we always tend to come here for special occasions."}
{"text":"Went there for my daughters birthday and she loved it. We finished our meal tipped the cook at our table paid and was outside talking when the waitress came out and complained we didn't tip her enough cause half her tip goes to the cook. Are you kidding me how is that my problem. And when was it ok to follow customers outside and ask for more money. I was so pissed and shocked that I will never go back to that place again."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places in Phoenix. All the Ah-So's are a chain but they do not all offer the same food choices. I really enjoyed a California roll, the tepanyaki show, and left overs. Delicious miso soup, salad, fried rice, veggies, chicken, steak, and shrimp. The sauces for each were also pretty good. I even had enough food left over for 1.5 more meals. Awesome sushi happy hour prices as well (as low as $2). I really enjoyed the beautiful waterfall separating the two aspects of the restaurant. Hope to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Their sushi is the absolute best!! I ordered over the phone and they were very polite and were able to answer my questions about what was inside some of the sushi rolls. My order was ready when I got there which was awesome because at a lot of places you are forced to wait additional time. I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was AWESOME! Just moved to AZ from living in Hawaii my whole life and its been tough finding REAL sushi and REAL sashimi here. The atmosphere is great, you can sit on one side of the restuarant and have your food cooked in front of you which seemed cool from where we were sitting.... but we were after more of the raw food they had. They sat us quickly, they came to the table immediately to take our drink order. Drinks were out super fast, and our order was taken. My eyes were bigger than my stomach but our waiter Lane ( i hope i heard it right) was so patient, professional and helpful. The Ahi (tuna/Maguro) was delicious, didn't taste frozen. I was told they bring it in fresh every morning. I could tell that was the truth. We ordered a little bit of everything and it was all fantastic. Spicy Ahi Roll, California Roll, Ahi Nigiri, Tekka Maki, Seaweed Salad, Gyoza and drinks. There are women in kimono walking around which was neat. There is a fountain in middle of room with Koi fish which we sat next to. All in All, couldn't have made anything better. Thank you for a great date night Ah-So, the hubby and I needed it! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Lane was our server at the bar and he was amazing. He got use everything we needed in perfect time and was very kind. The food was perfect and so was the sake and beer."}
{"text":"Went last night with my husband and daughter. We've been before for the teppanyaki, and have always had a good time. Our server was ok, we ordered our drinks and they were brought out. The chef came out to make our food and it was great!  Our daughter had a good time watching him cook. We tipped our chef when he was finish and went on to enjoy our meal. At the end when the bill came, we discovered that our server had tacked on a 20% tip for himself.  I under automatic gratuity for large parties, however, there were three of us. This automatic tip is not posted anywhere on the menu, door, or hostess stand. Also, when the receipt came back, there was only the one to sign, the itemized one was gone. Looking through the reviews, it would seem this is a recent practice and also not a consistent amount. It really is coming across shady. I almost always tip a standard 20%, even for minimal service (like here, our server took and brought out our drinks, checked on refills towards the very end of the meal, and brought out our soup and salad bowls). I'm not a fan of being charged gratuity automatically, especially when it isn't posted as policy and seems to be an arbitrary amount."}
{"text":"The first time I went with BF. I ordered sushi from happy hour menu. Happy hour is for a couple of hours the evening (sorry, don't remember) and 8pm-close. They have a great selection on the happy hour menu. Lots of appetizers, a handful of sushi rolls (including the Vegas Roll for 5$), and a LOT of drinks. BF ordered an entree of steak + shrimp. His only complaint, which I agreed with upon tasting, was that it was really salty. We ended with tempura ice cream which was an interesting and yummy combination of crunchy and hot and cold! Our server was very nice. 

The second time was with 13 people, teppanyaki-style. Our chef was great. I wish I caught his name. An egg landed in my drink but it was all in good fun. He was very talented and involved everyone. Very fun! BF and I ordered the exact same thing as last time. I had Eel Cucumber Roll and Vegas Roll. Again, very fresh. I had a Long Island Iced Tea which tasted great but they served it in those little glasses instead of the long ones. The four stars remains because I tasted BF's entree and it was still a bit salty. It's definitely better than last time. 

Also, the entree portions are pretty big. Many of our friends couldn't finish and took it to-go. 

Taking care of so many guests at a time, especially when some of them are as goofy as our friends, can be a challenge but the servers were attentive and very nice.

In summation, great people and great happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time for tempanyaki. Very entertaining, lots of food, kind of expensive. Need to look for coupons and will try again. Also was a birthday but was no acknowledged, slightly disappointed but still enjoyable"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's the original location and so friendly! The waitress, hostess and chef all quickly made friends with us and checked in often to make sure all was great. We went for a birthday dinner and their birthday song/ceremony was pretty sweet (with drums, singing and a tasty birthday platter). Upon leaving the hostess remembered our customizations, asked how they were and even sent us off with handshakes and hugs. Such a great place (did I say that already?). It's kind of a small place but the ambience is great and the food was really good. Cadie (our 3 year old) had so much fun watching the chef and almost caught one of those flying pieces of chicken in her mouth. I had sashimi (even though everyone else had the chef prepared-in-front-of-you meal) and everything was super good. We will definitely be back as soon as possible. It's so nice to make friends with the crew so quickly. I can't wait to return! :)"}
{"text":"Took my Fiancé here as she loves sushi -- I don't enjoy it, but you have to bend sometimes. I didn't eat the sushi, but let's just say she left a third of the plate there. I ordered chicken and shrimp w/ white rice and vegetables. I didn't know five ounces of oil came with my food -- I ended up using the rice to soak the oil from the food. My Fiancé and I are having real stomach discomfort and haven't felt well since about two hours after we ate... I think it was the oil for me, but her issues are worse then mine and it's been a rough evening for her. Beware-- if you eat oil by the spoonful you'll be good... just hope my Fiancé feels better."}
{"text":"The have a good sushi happy hour here. The service us good at this location compared to others. Worth giving a shot."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner at Ah-So. Sushi is definitely an acquired taste for me and I'm frankly still in the process of fully acquiring it. So while I happy to try something outside my usual culinary experiences, I was thrilled to learn that they also offered Tepanyaki-style cooking (I REFUSE to go to Benihana!!!)

To get the best of both worlds, we had sushi as an appetizer which I found quite enjoyable. The highlight of my meal however was Tepanyaki with filet mignon and scallops. The scallops were delicious-some of the best I've had and the filet was grilled to medium rare tenderness just like I like it.  The chef put on an amazing show grilled everything before our eyes.

It was a great night and at $28 for the Tepanyaki, it was a great deal considering the quality and quantity of food.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"That was GROSS. Some of the worst sushi and worst service I have ever received in my life. I LOVE sushi and am very disappointed not only in the service and food but also in the way the manager handled the situation (or FAILED to handle). I have been a server, manager and NEVER complain. But I cannot believe how awful this was. I'm praying I don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Rude manager. Turned away on a Monday. No room for teppanyaki. Maybe there were reservations, but he needs to work on his delivery."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the service was quite entertaining !! Make sure you get a cooking table and enjoy"}
{"text":"Had a fun lunch here.  Filet and chicken teppanyaki, fried rice and a cold Coke®, wife had the filet.  Food was good.  Would visit again.

Staff was friendly and attentive.  The teppanyaki chef was efficient and polite.  However, \"the show\" was minimal and limited to fork/knife taps.  No flips, dips, or flying shrimp.

Tax, title, license and fed for $47 (including tip).

Be prepared for the little ones to be running amok, falling into the Koi pond."}
{"text":"The service was rather terrible. My fiancé and I came in for our anniversary dinner and it took nearly 15 minutes just to get a water. There were literally only two other tables being waited on and they never took our food orders. Other tables that sat after us were Recieving food already and we hadn't even ordered. After waiting for 20 minutes without ordering we decided to leave."}
{"text":"Great place for a date... The steak is amazing! !  Shrimp dishes are cooked to perfection. .. they have great deals on sushi during happy hour after 8:pm... I keep going back."}
{"text":"This has been on my list for years as after I was disappointed by my trip to the one on 75th I was told this original one was no longer connected to the others and that it was better. I agree! We had a reservation for 7 and got there about 5 minutes early and were seated right away and the 3rd party at our table arrived shortly. On a busy night you might want to leave time to park further away if needed, we got the last spot in the lot they share with Black Bear diner. Service was spot on and everything flowed nicely the whole evening. The cook, while not the most entertaining fellow, was talkative and did an excellent job. The food was all well prepared. I had the filet/shrimp combo. The pricing was in line with what I expected. The folks to our left said it was the only teppan table in the valley they would go to. I'm a bit more adventurous than that but there was definitely nothing I found lacking. I tend to give well run Teppan grills a round up because I like them. This will be the 3rd time I gave one a five (actually the first one was over 30 years ago). The other 2 are long gone so I hope this one sticks around."}
{"text":"I had a most enjoyable experience this afternoon at the Ah So Sushi and Steak Restaurant at the Happy Valley, Norterra location in Phoenix.
To my surprise they not only offer sushi, but Teppanyaki as well.  I had been driving to Kierland in Scottsdale, which is 30 some miles from my home, but now will be a \"regular\" at this fabulous restaurant.  
My meal was delicious! The service was no less than outstanding.
I even took an additional meal home for later!  (gotta love it!)
If you are looking for a great place to enjoy sushi or Teppanyaki, look no further!
I strongly recommend the Ah So over Sapporro, or Benihana in every way!

{"text":"Sushi was really delicious and the special rolls came out to around $10 at lunch.

The sushi chef could work a little on the packing and cutting of the sushi. The individual rolls were too large and hard to hold. 

However, everything tasted amazing and the ingredients were fresh. Service was solid. I did see the sushi chef a piece of garbage behind the sushi counter when no one was looking- thought it was a bit unprofessional."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious.  Much needed sushi fix.  Pleasant, unrushed lunch."}
{"text":"This is the original ah so and this should be the only one cause the others dont compare. Everyone here is so nice almost to nice if thats possible. I have been going here for years and I have been here three times in the last month. I always sit at the teppan table and get filet and shrimp and order a sushi roll. Everytime I go I create my own roll and just tell them what I want in it and they always make it just the way I was seeing it or even better. The miso soup here has beef broth in it. Its so good. It seems like most places are just chicken stock miso. All the teppan chefs are great and do all the teppan table tricks as usual like the volcano onion and flick a shrimp in your mouth with there spachula. They have $5 saki bombers for happy hour and always have some kind of special going on like special sushi rolls and entrees. They have a pound in the middle of the dinning area with small koi fish in it. I have never had a bad meal here ever."}
{"text":"I had came in one of the many few times, paid my bill , and it turned out I got charged twice! Waited a week for them to refund my money, told myself next time I'll bring cash instead. Yesterday, me & some friends went out for dinner at ah-so. We received our rolls & we noticed they weren't tight enough. They were unraveling & sloppy. The texture and taste was just not up to the usual quality from the past times we had been in. Idk if it's because it was close to closing time, but we brought it to the waiters attention and she assumed we didn't know how to use chop sticks & decided to give us forks! Instead of offering to tighten our rolls or a discount of some sort would had been fine but we got nothing.. Being loyal customers I found that upsetting but at the end it's their loss."}
{"text":"Food was great had a good time. The only thing is the guy we got didn't entertain much. There was a cook next to him that was more entertaining than the one we got but cannot complain. Great place, will eat there again."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC Teppan Steak and Sushi.

There isn't much more that I can say that others haven't. This place is clean and friendly, good atmosphere, the prices are...well...sushi prices.

The Teppan table is a show in itself, the steak and calamari are both outstanding, but the sushi bar is wonderful as well.

Order yourself a sake bomber and a Tempura roll--best sushi roll on any menu I have ever had. It is essentially a Philly roll that has been tempura battered and flash fried, then drizzled with a sweet soy sauce. The thing is practically a dessert, you must try it."}
{"text":"Want to be Benihana. Not worth the money.  Food was unimpressive.  Server was not attentive. Some of the menu items do not list all toppings. For example one of the dishes said nothing about mushrooms on the menu yet came topped with a ton of mushrooms.  For the price I would go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Called to order ahead for pick up and was told to come and order at the restaurant. Highly inconvenient. What's the purpose of calling ahead to save time if I have to wait??"}
{"text":"They don't honor coupons from \"Coupon Clipper\" app.  They require the coupon to be printed. Not cool. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food and decent service! Went for happy hour and was very impressed! The fried rice is also a must.... SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Service was good & happy we had Chuck as our Chef! The price was high for what you got. Six people and in to it for over $200. Come on,,,,it's rice & vegetable with a little meat."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great food and outstanding service!  Thank you yelpers, I didn't even know it existed!"}
{"text":"I honestly felt a little sketched out by how dingy and dark the interior was at lunch. Not very busy, either. Sushi was okay, but not rolled well at all, and our server barely knew the menu. 

And I'm sorry, but those menus... they need some work. Laminated printer paper with typos and comic sans won't win this designer over :P"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but they automatically added a 25% tip to our bill of 5 people and THEN had the audacity to not give us the original receipt showing the added gratuity when they brought back the credit card receipt for us to sign which conviniently had a blank tip line. Nice try!!!"}
{"text":"We have been to the Ah-So chain and heard a lot about this non chain restaurant. The wait staff was friendly and we were seated quickly. Our chef cooked our order and entertained us with the tricks of the teppenyaki trade. Our family was delighted and the food was a shade above the quality at the chain. I really enjoyed the spicy tuna roll I ordered as an appetizer and the salad dressing was very good. We were celebrating our daughters 10 th year birthday and the experience didn't disappoint. We were offered a birthday special which consisted of a wonderful fruit desert and a commerative photo. 

We really prefer this Ah-So steakhouse and will be back."}
{"text":"This place has horrible service, I'm not sure if they are racist to their own race or what their problem is. They gave us miso soup without spoons, which is fine because some places do that, but when I asked for spoons they said, \"that's how to drink miso, without spoons.\" I don't know what else to say really, a restaurant can't even give me spoons because I asked for some? And when she told me this, she had this attitude like I am crazy because I asked for something outrageous or something. Ridiculous I tell you, I've never been back and never will. The sushi was decent, but by that time I was too irritated to care."}
{"text":"The owners are very rude.. food is OK..not the best"}
{"text":"Sushi was good. I shared off my date's plate since I've only ever had a California roll.
Tasted the tempura shrimp and vegetables.
Service was good over all. 
I will be returning."}
{"text":"Went there with friends this evening and had a great time! The steak and seafood combinations are great! Even the salad dressing on the side salad was so delicious I wanted to eat it with a spoon! My friends who went with me also really enjoyed it; we definitely plan to go back."}
{"text":"Three stars as a happy medium. The hostesses (all 4) were rude and did not have an understanding of respect for customers. No eye contact and not one of them knew who was supposed to do what. Waited to be seated for a few minutes. We got seats where the food was cooked in front of us. I highly recommend this as it was amazing, entertaining and impressive. The food is great when it comes to seafood. The steak is good however not the best quality. A bit dry and endlessly chewy. I requested medium rare and was cooked a medium/full cooked steak. They're a bit small as well, not exactly what I was expecting. The performance and experience with friends was more what made it stand out. Good place but could use some better service by 90% of the staff. The chef stood out the best"}
{"text":"For entertainment this is hands down great. They cook in front of you and out on a show if it's a birthday or special occasion. I love it. 
Food is pretty awesome however I really so feel that it is kinda on the pricey end of sushi. It's because of the entertainment I'm sure. Staff is pretty cool. 
So if your looking for entertainment with dinner come here for sure. 
If you want more intimate settings try kabuki at westgate."}
{"text":"I went to Ah-So with family in Phoenix. It was outstanding! 

The \"show\" was fun and our chef was really personable but not so in your face that we couldn't visit amongst ourselves. That was important to me since I was there visiting from out of town and my 8 year old nephew was with us. :) He also enjoyed the food very much which says a lot! Most 8 year olds are so picky...but my little guy was eating shrimp, steak, the works! 

I had the steak and shrimp with rice. The seasoning was just right and it was delicious. When I return to AZ to visit family again, I'll definitely have Ah-So on my itinerary!"}
{"text":"Love the food. I've eaten here for a couple years now. The chefs are always so friendly and entertaining. The owners are so involved too. BUT, the last time we came for dinner  apparently we didn't leave a tip big enough for them. We always tip the  teppanyaki chef since they basically provide all the food. We orders two sushi rolls and like water and lemonade. Never really asked much from the waitress. If you've ever been here, the bill is hardly ever less than $100. 
We left a $20 tip for the waitress since she brought us water. We were literally getting in our car when she ran after us because the tip wasn't enough!!!! 

Correct me if I'm wrong. A tip is not mandatory! You get paid to do a job and the tips are props! 
Whether it's $0 or $5 dollars. You should not demand more from the guest. If you don't get paid enough from the job that's something you should discuss with your boss. Not demand a bigger tip because YOU DONT THINK ITS ENOUGH! 

Like I said, food is great. Waitresses are shit!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place. Dark and waterfalls with fish right in the middle of the restaurant. I come here during happy hour because that is the best time to come. Order of edamame, two California rolls, Las Vegas roll and two orders of Miso soup for $14. Can't beat $7 a person. The service is great and the people are friendly. No complaints at all except I probably wouldn't eat here if they didn't have happy hour specials because of the high price."}
{"text":"We love the chef cooking on the teppan grill right in front of us.  They serve enough food for you to have another meal with the leftovers.  The food tasted great and the vegetables were better than the chicken!  The shrimps are highly recommended if you don't want to go vegetarian.  We can't wait to go back here!"}
{"text":"Today we are trying the Breeze Roll. Loved it. I love the dresses the Hostess wears."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick lunch while on business travel in Glendale. The service was quick and they had a great selection on the lunch menu. Chicken and beef noodle bowls, chicken teriyaki, sushi combos and sashimi combos. All come with miso soup and asian salad and are $8-$12. Pleased both sushi lovers and haters. Will definitely return next time we are here. 

BTW- They do love a California roll here - at least five  variations on the menu (California crunch, spicy California, baked California, etc.)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night recently and I was quite impressed.  The sushi was great and enjoyed the ambiance with the waterfall in the middle of the restaurant.  I'd give this place 5 stars only if they updated the place a little.  

Overall I'd say check this place out and give it a shot.  Next time I will do the teppanyaki and see if that lets me overlook the outdated decor to push this place to 5 stars."}
{"text":"First off, this is an entertaining place. They cook in front of you and sometimes throw you food to see if you can catch it in your mouth (lol). It's fun.

I haven't tried the sushi rolls, so I can't judge those.

However, I have tried to Filet mignon dish + fried rice. The filet mignon is good, but the fried rice is okay. It's not bad, but its not wonderful either. The price is a little high, but filet mignon is usually expensive anyway.

I guess I would recommend this place. I will come back one day to try the sushi rolls."}
{"text":"After craving sushi for several weeks, I stopped in with some classmates for lunch. My other classmates had absolutely raved about this place for so long that I was pretty excited. After seeing the happy hour menu, I was somewhat underwhelmed. Their happy hour menus included 4-5 different types of nigiri (salmon, tuna, egg, white fish, and I forgot the last one) and 4-5 different rolls. I ordered the salmon sushi, tuna sushi and the Las Vegas Roll (Deep Fried roll with cream cheese and salmon). The Vegas roll was good but HEAVY. A couple bites were okay but after awhile it got difficult to eat. The salmon was TASTY as usual. Tuna was not my favorite. The best part of my meal was the miso soup hah.

Overall, not bad. Not great, but not bad. I will probably be back just because their happy hour prices are pretty good as I ended up with 4 different items for about $15."}
{"text":"This Ah-So isn't as fabulous as the one on Happy Valley but it has 1 super special thing to keep the kids happy......   An indoor \"river\" with turtles.  It's pretty cool and the kids will love it while waiting for the chef to show them the volcano made out of onions on the teppanyaki grill."}
{"text":"Wow, poor quality service, food, and a forced gratuity?! Save your money. The show is not worth it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and both times the rice and chicken were fantastic. The cooking performance was entertaining both times I was here. I cannot give it a five because of the charge incurred for splitting a plate."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!! So good. Yes, its a little pricey but so worth it. It's a kinda whole-in-the-wall type of place but the food is great. I take my family there for special occasions and my little on gets a kick out of the hibachi grill experience."}
{"text":"I have tried many sushi bars in Phoenix but as far as the quality, this location is the best I've had. I was at their location on 75th ave and have to say, the service there was much worse than this location. I took one star away because this place is kind of a dive and needs a facelift...however, that does not reflect the quality of their food. The staff is friendly and attentive. I saw a few negative reviews regarding the service. I wonder if maybe they were short staffed that day or if those people were too demanding. I've never had an issue with service here. I really wish that there were more of a variety of rolls. What they have is pretty traditional. The cucumber eel roll is probably my favorite here. There are a couple more sushi restaurants I haven't tried out yet but so far this is the best."}
{"text":"We came for lunch a few weeks ago, and thought it was pretty good. Quality, quantity, and price was reasonable for lunch.  It was nice to be seated quickly and in and out in bout an hour.   was concerned that because of the style it would waste to much of my lunch time but it did not.

We will be back again"}
{"text":"I almost left after I walked in as it didn't look that great and then the waiter didn't help my comfort for the place. My wife and I decided to stay and we were happy we did as the sushi was really good. The nigiri just melted in your mouth."}
{"text":"Such a fun experience . Took my best friend here and the show was amazing . The chef was personable, and we had great conversation with him while he cooked our food . Not to mention the food was PHENOMENAL. Definitely my new favorite place to go. It's such a fun experience with great quality food"}
{"text":"This is our absolute fav place to go to! Great service! Great food! Great sushi by far!! We really love this place!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ah-So a few times and it's always fun.  My friends and I sit at the teppanyaki tables where your food is prepared right in front you.  The cook always makes things lively by yelling, pouring hideous mystery liquors down your throat or even doing a semi strip-tease dance.

The food is pretty tasty, I get the shrimp dinner, which comes with rice, soup and salad if I remember correctly.  You have a choice of vegetable, chicken, shrimp or steak and I think the priciest option is around $16-17.  I've yet to try their sushi though.

Drinks are good to and all in all, Ah-So is an entertaining spot to have dinner and spend time with your friends.  Be prepared though, because diners are loud and often celebrate birthdays there."}
{"text":"Love Ahso!!! Favorite place to go. Happy hour at 9;00 has best prices for fabulous food. I don't eat rice so I had them replace with soy paper and it was delicious... Awesome food and service. Great for little get togetherness with friends or date. They have a DJ on Saturday nights. No dancing but good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Still great, after all of these years.

Wish they had cold draft saki.  It's expensive to order the bottles."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a teppanyaki place in our neck of the woods but were a little leery of this place from the old \"drive by\" since it's in a strip mall in an older building.  This was nonsense however, because inside the place ended up being pretty interesting and delightful.  Sure, it's an older building but the place seemed really clean, the bathrooms were well kept and here's the BONUS - they got the long fountain / fish pond working and filled with fish (and turtles!).  It's quite unique - check out the pics here on yelp.

We came for teppanyaki and were seated right away and only had to wait a few minutes for the other half of the grill table to fill up.  My husband opted for sushi instead and ordered a rainbow roll.  He said it was good, not the best he'd had, but that it was pretty sizeable and filled him up.

My daughter and I had teppanyaki - she ordered shrimp and I had steak & lobster - yum!  (c'mon this was a Mother's Day celebration...)  The chef was really young but he was quite funny and obviously talented.  He was flipping rice clumps into our mouths (I caught it - yay!) lighting onion volcanoes, tossing prank eggs at us (empty shells) and making Nemo jokes - my daughter loved it!  He cooked everything really well and made the evening so special.  

They sang for about 4 birthdays while we were there, they were enthusiastic and the birthday havers seemed really ecstatic - they brought some special fruit plate type of desert thing out.

The ice tea wasn't so good but the turtles made up for that - let's hear it for turtles!"}
{"text":"Okay, the prices are a bit steep but when I book a table for the \"4 of us\" (4 lifelong friends) I know we aren't gonna get away with \"happy hour pricing\" on anything. So, we ordered up the scallops & filet, the shrimp & filet, some tempura starters, and a couple of sushi rolls - plus drinks all around. We sat at the teppanyaki tables which doesn nothing for me ambiance wise but it was a bit chilly, so the flames were welcomed. The server was a bit overattentive prior to our ordering - we were trying to hang out and have a good time...after we ordered, he kind of disappeared. He did stop by finally when I switched from beer to Maker's Mark (which he had never heard of but the bartender was on it). Scallops were cooked perfectly, as were filets (rare and med-rare). Shrimp was a TAD overdone but that's pretty much par for the course and scallops outweigh shrimps in our book. Fried rice was meh but that's how I think of fried rice in general. We'll go back for sure...but here's what you might want to know...

FRAUD ALERT. AMEX flagged the card and sent a fraud alert message because we had used it earlier in Phoenix (Obviously) but the restaurant CC processor shows as Restaurant, New York, so it looked like the card was being used across country an hour later. It still went through, just be aware that you may get a message on your phone when they run the card."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful place to have dinner. Extremely entertaining and the people that work there are great. We had a blast thank you very much to Juan and Gigi"}
{"text":"This is not Benihana and I mean that in a very good way. The food is great the cook is not overbearing. The only downfall is that it's so small. I called ahead and they put my name down and on a Saturday I was able to walk in. The prices where less than Red lobster and the food was delicious. I would come here Again if I visit Arizona. Side note they did not add gratuity to our check like the other reviews say. I was very happy to break my diet for this place."}
{"text":"Bomb Japanese food ever!!! Pocholo has been always great to my friends familly and I. He is always professional at what he does. customer service is great, food is great, and the place all around is the best place that i have ever been to. I highly recomend ah so and if you do go there talk to Pocholo."}
{"text":"Been going here for a couple years now. The first discovery was the chicken bowl and beef bowl, for 5.95 the chicken bowl is a 10/10! I get Siracha on the side and a whole fresh jalepeno to really set it on fire. Before ah so, the only sushi I've had was the imitation meat from frys lol, and I hated it. Ah So made me like sushi. I get the spicy crab or golden avacado."}
{"text":"Went to Ah-So last night for the first time. Took advice from other reviewers and drove right past the location on Happy Valley and proceeded to this one. What a wonderful experience it was! Good service, the owner and his wife welcomed us personally... and the food was great. I had the Filet, Shrimp and Chicken Teppanyaki combo; my dining partner had the lobster, scallop and shrimp combo. The young grill master (Terry) was funny and quite adept with the tools of the trade. The filet was my favorite - it was like buttah. Just melted in your mouth. The scallops were cooked perfectly. It was a mountain of food and now we have dinner for tonight. Just one thing could have been better - we waited for our second hot sake order. But Terry saved the day and ran over to the bar himself and filled the order. Over and Above... We are looking forward to returning to this little jewel!"}
{"text":"Used the coupons from the frys receipt and had a great experience.  Fast service. Large portions, great presentation and tasted great. When we are craving sushi this is our spot."}
{"text":"This a great place for a fun dinner...and the food is plentiful and delicious.  Here are my tip....
1. Have you first drink at the bar cuz you'll save $.  A Saki Bomber at the bar is $6 and at you table is $9.
2. Must eat at the grill.
3. Be prepared to catch food in your mouth.
4. The \"spicy\" is spicy so go spicy.
5. You must have KERRY/CARY (not sure of spelling) as your chef....he is amazing, funny, witty, sarcastic...and no one is safe from his commentary.
We had a memorable and enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Just ate here last night with my hubby and little sister! 

Me and hubby had the filet and shrimp and as a table we shared a roll of sushi and a squid salad. My little sister ordered Mango shrimp. 

We loved our dishes, the steak is so tender, it really melts in your mouth! 

My sister had a bad experience with her mango shrimp, she did not like the taste of it, as it was a unique flavor, but the staff there was amazing! The chef offered to remake her something else, but at that point we were already there for awhile and she was tired. He called over what I assume was the manager? She asked personally if we wanted anything remade and was very nice and professional about it! 

I normally do not write reviews, but thought this deserved it because of the way we were treated and it really is refreshing when so many places have lost the concept of customer service. They went above and beyond to make sure everything was ok! 

The location looks small from the outside, but give it a try, the food is excellent and the service is even better . 

5 stars for sure !"}
{"text":"Enjoying this amazing happy hour 7 days a week 2:30 to close 199 Dr $5 stockings and 399 sushi rolls never fails every single time a great experience great food and amazing employees"}
{"text":"whether youre sitting at one of the tepan tables, or just a dining table, you'll have a pleasant experience either way. the chefs are friendly, talkative, and know how to put on a show while they prepare your food. the servers are attentive and friendly. pricing is fair for the great quality of the food. they also have an excellent happy hour menu with even better prices. always love coming here!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 9 on New Year's Eve. called back a few days later to add 3 more and they happily obliged.  seating was tight but do-able. Restaurant is dark and dinghy.

Most ordered off the couples menu. (if there are at least 2 I highly recommend, in the end it will save you a load of money) Several ordered a appetizer. We ordered the sp38. Mango Tempura Shrimp Roll. Our cup of Miso soup and ginger dressed salad arrived right away along with our drinks.

Our chef started our dinner \"show\", he was fantastic, funny. Filet mignon, shrimp and chicken along with the rice and vegetables are all cooked on the same grill so be prepared if you have food allergies.

Roll arrived. Mango was thinly sliced and fresh. Shrimp in the roll crunchy and tasty. Sauces served with dinner flavorful. Filet mignon was like butter.

Overall this is a great place for a 1st date or special occasion. Service is attentative and stellar. But be prepared. For 4 adults, 2 kids, 1 appetizer, 1 draft beer, 1 bottled Saporo, 1 Mai Tai, 3 sodas with the 2 shared entrees our bill was $236."}
