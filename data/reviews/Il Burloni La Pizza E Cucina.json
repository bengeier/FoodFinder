{"text":"Not impressed. Service was poor. Food was slightly above average. Our entrees came out one at a time over a 10 minute period."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant and I heard good things about it. I Made reservations for 2 on a Wednesday afternoon and we were the only two in the restaurant. We were seated at a two top and received the signature bread and bean dip, which was mediocre. 

The server corked our bottle of wine and came back honestly 2 minutes later asking if we were ready to order. I replied \"no.\" She went back to the server station to read her \"OK\" magazine. 

Another couple entered the restaurant and was seated at the two top table directly next to us out of the entire empty restaurant. C'mon! The server came back a few minutes later and took our order. I ordered the Caprese salad and The Griglia Chicken which coincidentally, so did my fianc√©. The salad came out in a quick manor and was delicious. I was optimistic that our dinner would be as well.

When the entree arrived, I was very dissapointed. It was simply plain grilled chicken and grilled vegetables which I could easily cook on my grill at my house. The menu described it as, \"Grilled Chicken with Lemon Basil Marinade?\" It was extremely bland and flavorless. 

We were never checked on throughout the meal- and our waitress socialized with the only other waitress on duty. We will definitely not be returning. What a dissapointing experience!"}
{"text":"Pappardelle with sausage and goat cheese was very good. Started with grilled calamari and this was just delicious with the sundried tomato sauce and olives. Dessert was excellent!  Key lime pie and wild blueberry pie. Yes there is a huge difference in blueberries and if you haven't tried wild what  are you waiting for?!?
The music was a tad loud but that keeps the conversation confidential ;-)
Take a nice red and enjoy the Italian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Excellent little BYOB place with reasonable corkage fees. I'm partial to the Pappardelle w/ Sausage, Onion, Goat Cheese in a Lite Red Sauce. It is the most frequent thing I order.The bolognese is also excellent as far as the pasta dishes go.

Typically they have a fresh fish special. I have ordered these from time to time and have always enjoyed them. It is not an overly large place so it can be hard to get a table. Given this I have ordered take out from here multiple times and it has always held up well. They also make it a point to give you everything that would be served to a sit down patron such as bread."}
{"text":"This is our Favorite BYOB Italian Restaurant.  The chef and the servers are the best."}
{"text":"The place is small and was busy! Glad we called to reserve a time & table. Wonderful food. If you like beets, you'll rave over the roasted beet salad. Pasta Bolognese - excellent. Pasta Arrabiata, oh yeah it's \"angry\" with roasted peppers. It'll warm your tongue in a good spicy way. Tiramisu & Coconut Creme pie made it complete. Yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent!! Food is fantastic. Service is excellent. One hell of a good chef! Have sent many friends here! Love it! On my faves list!"}
{"text":"I am not someone who would take the time to write a review whether negative or positive yet my experience with my family was so bad.  We selected this restaurant to celebrate my father's birthday.  This by no means should be a restaurant selected for special occasions.  Yes, the food is delicious yet that is easily forgotten when the service is average and the owner is just rude and lacks professionalism and consideration.  My suggestion pick another location with delicious food and a welcoming atmosphere.  There are plenty of restaurants in the area that serve delicious food and can make you and your friends and family feel like they are the most important people in the world."}
{"text":"Il burloni is amazing! I had been wanting to check out this restaurant for quite some time, but never got around to it due to the fact the the inside is really small, so you need to make reservations ahead of time. 
Recently, on a Tuesday, my friend and I were getting our nails done a few doors down and smelt the food when leaving the nail salon. It smelt great, so we decided to walk over and see what it was all about. People were sitting outside. They had little tables set up alone the sidewalk. We decided to give it a try and boy am I glad we did! 
The service was absolutely amazing. I wish I could remember our servers name to give her a shout out. I got the penne vodka, add Italian sausage. Absolutely delicious and such a large portion, I was able to eat the other half for Lunch the next day. My friend got an eggplant dish that was on special and it too, was incredible. I will certainly be returning and I recommend you readers to do the same. Just remember, make a reservation if you are trying to go on the weekend!"}
{"text":"So yum! Staff is amazing. Had a great valentines party here and everyone was spectacular!!!"}
{"text":"Found the staff to be rude to the point I wanted to walk out without eating my meal. Almost did except we were with other people. Watched the manager /owner put on her makeup and lipstick while I ate my dinner.  Could hear her on the phone warning people who were making reservations that their table would reset after 90 minutes. Really. 
It's a shame because the food is really really good. The only problem is their all about the money. Turning tables quickly being rude to customers and their well behaved  children  won't keep them on business too long. 

As for the several comments regarding good friendly service I wouldn't be surprised if the owners wrote them to off set the  bad reviews. 

I will never go back no matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"Always being eyeing this little eatery whenever we went grocery shopping to Green Tree..always used to wonder why all the tables seemed to be always taken and even though it's in a strip mall where outside seating isn't that inviting - all tables outside are taken too! 
So finally got the chance to reserve for 5 PM on a Sunday - not busy but people were just starting  l swarm in . A small place indoors and a lot of tables outside which are a little cramped. The decor is nothing to boast about yet pleasant .
Now the food - the bread - you can even avoid it . Not worth it . 
The Penne in vodka sauce - flavorful , beautiful colors and top notch ! 
The special of the day - pork chops with a lot of veggies ( including sweet pepper) and sausage
- highlight of the day ! Very rich Tomato sauce - excellent sausage - the pork chops weren't cook f to perfection but nothing that cannot be overlooked 

So all in all this place is worth the praise !"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough about this amazing restaurant. Authentic, delicious Italian cuisines made with the freshest ingredients. Such a great variety, and portions are excellent. My favorite thing I've ordered there is the angel hair with spinach, crabmeat and pine nuts. AMAZING! Service is always fantastic. Such a great atmosphere. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Let me first say that the service is great!  So cudo's to the waitress, however, the waitress only takes the order and brings the food.

The bread served was stale and tasteless, the oil dipping sauce matched.

We started with fresh deep fried mozzarella, despite being cooked, the cheese was cold and soggy.  I have had this dish elsewhere and it has been prepared properly.  Here I would not recommend at all!

We have been here a couple of times and the food is very inconsistent, perhaps average at best depending on the dish you order.  The Veal Marsala was one of the worst I have ever ordered anywhere.  The veal was clearly a lesser cut, basically a roll roast cut into thick slices, NOT pounded flat at all.  So it was just several pieces of 3/8\" hockey puck size of veal which was not tender.  The Marsala sauce was missing something, tasted bitter or sour, I think it was missing the marsala.  The dish was overpowered by an excessive quantity of jumbo shitake mushrooms, I mean overpowered.  Not an enjoyable meal at all.

My wife ordered the Bucatini with marinara, now that was not bad, the bucatini is a relatively large round noodle which is like spaghetti on steriods.

Overall the restaurant is very small and very noisy, but that is acceptable.  But the food is just a complete hit or miss for the price.  Too pricey for hit or miss!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is coined as a \"Pizza\" joint...definitely NOT! This is authentic Italian at its best! It's small, so make reservations, even during the week. The fried zucchini appetizer was the lightest, crispiest and most delicious I've had anywhere. It's BYOB, so make sure that you do, if you want some wine with dinner. I never would have know this place was here...it really is a \"hidden gem\". I can't wait to go back.

I had the Balsamico Chicken. It was amazing! So yummy, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! My husband had the ravioli. He is a pasta fanatic and thought it was delicious. So many flavors! We shared a piece of lemon cake for dessert. Light, fluffy, and perfect!"}
{"text":"Looking for a great place to eat.  This is it!!  Food was outstanding, served hot and delicious.  Some might think a little pricey...our dinner was $70 for 2, with one app, 2 dinners and one desert.  But for good quality I thought it worth it.  I had the Balsamico and my dinner partner had the Griglia.  Both meals were very good.  The Balsamico is done with a balsamic reduction.  Just wonderful.  Service was really good.  If your lucky to get Krysten, she was friendly, funny and very attentive.  It's a byob place so bring a good bottle and enjoy.  Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Hard to find (it was in a shopping plaza) but delicious! Get a reservation and bring some vino. House salad dressing was so good. I wish they sold it!!"}
{"text":"Good food with excellent service. Reasonable pricing. Very accommodating staff. Appetizers were quick and the meals came out promptly. BYOB"}
{"text":"This place is the definition of a \"hidden gem\".  Important points:

1. Seafood is fresh
2. Fried eggplant is the lightest I've ever had
3. BYOB
4. Tiramisu is more \"cakey\" (which I prefer.  Don't enjoy eating just cream)

I've come here just to buy sauce to bring home for when we make pasta.  The place is very small, so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"GUYS. I thought this place was really good before, but I just went back and they totally knocked it out of the park. As always, the service was great (I can never remember our server's name - eek - but she was wonderful!) but OMG. THE FOOD. I had one of the specials (linguine allo scoglio) this time around. It's a linguine dish that comes with mussels, scallops, crab, calamari, and shrimp. You had your choice of red or white sauce, and I got the white which was an olive oil/garlic situation. It was AMAZING. If you are ever in the area, check this place out."}
{"text":"First off our waitress was the nicest person to walk the earth. She kept giving us free bread and when we wanted to share the caprese app she put it on three separate plates for us to make it easier. I had the paparadelle with sausage onion goat cheese and a lite tomato sauce. She let me sub out sausage for eggplant. The portion was enormous, and extremely flavorful. It was a hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"We have been to Burloni many times over the past few years. Every time we left full, happy and content. Yes this place is very small. They do have a few tables outside when it is warm. Our latest adventure to IB brought a table of 8. I'm sure they were annoyed with us seeing I called the day of to make reservations and called back 2 more times that day to change the number of people. Regardless, our table was ready when we arrived. 
We started our meal with the calamari, fried zucchini, and sausage with peppers and onions. The sausage is my favorite app. Not too sweet, not too spicy. Perfectly complimented with freshly sauteed onions and peppers. Although I have tried many dishes at IB, my go to is the grilled chicken (pollo griglia) with vegetables. Two marinated chicken breasts grilled and served with a huge plateful of various veggies-carrots, broccoli, potatoes, onions, peppers, cauliflower, brussel sprouts. If it's in season, you're getting it. I always add a large helping of the shredded cheese they leave for you on the table. Another favorite is the pasta bolognaise which hubs ordered and I stole a few bites of. They also offer a few desserts that change with the season. Unfortunately, I'm usually too full to try them. Overall, small restaurant, not much in the way of decor/ambience but great food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Never had a bad meal...not even close.  Veal Marsala is fabulous...but everything we've ordered there has been fabulous.  Love this small restaurant..."}
{"text":"What a great \"little\" find and an awesome Italian meal. I say little because it's a small restaurant but the meal was big in taste. From salad to dessert, you\"ll enjoy it all. BYOB and make a reservation for this gem."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with an other couple.   First off it is BYOB so I am already a fan!  The cork fee was  a few bucks.  The menu changes by season, and they have a few specials.  Our table ordered a salad, the veggie plate and the meatballs to start.  All very good!  I had the penne vodka and it was super yummy!  Great sauces and pasta cooked perfectly.  The waitress was very good.  We were catching up with friends and dining slowly and she didn't rush us at all.  Was a little disappointed that they ran out of Tiramisu when it was time to order dessert.  
Some other people commented on the owner.  She was very kind and helpful while we were there.  Came to check on our table a few times and was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing dinner last night!!  Our waitress was super friendly and attentive, which was amazing, considering she was the only waitress in the entire restaurant for the majority of our meal.  
For appetizers, we had the grilled calamari and fried zucchini... both equally delicious, but pleasing in different ways. The calamari was perfectly tender and flavorful in an olive marinara.  The zucchini was paper thin and fried to perfection.
I had the caprese salad and then the veal piccata, a little tart, but delicious.  Others at the table - caesar salads, veal marsala, veal milenese and the absolute best at the table... parpadalle with sausage and goat cheese.  Seriously, the pasta knocked everything out of the park!  
We finished the meal with house made tiramisu and a 1/2 press of coffee.
This meal was absolute perfection.  The atmosphere left a little to be desired, as it is in a strip mall and the tables/chairs/booths looked a little thrown together.  But was quickly forgotten when the food was presented.  Also - BYOB with 5$ corkage fee... doesn't get better than that!
One suggestion - make reservations in advance.  We've tried to get in several times by calling that night/weekend and finally got a table when we called 2 weeks in advance.
We can't wait to go back!  Well done, all!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Italian restaurant in the area. Every dish that I have had in my 6+ times have been perfectly and expertly prepared. Il Burloni is a small, quaint, BYOB, romantic piece of perfection."}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable evening with friends.  Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Had the grilled calamari in tomato sauce:  a little saltier than usual.  I also had the linguine with white clam sauce.  Good chunks of clams; but mix with a little less oil next time.  

A friend had the beet salad which is always amazing.  Il burloni hits the nail on the head with its salads.  

Chcoloate snowball cake did not have a lot of flavor, either in the white icing or the chocolate cake.  French press coffee was very good."}
{"text":"I picked this restaurant for my birthday dinner with my cousins. I'm attracted to 'made-to-order' restaurants that can accommodate someone with a severe dairy allergy, but unfortunately I chose poorly. Let me caveat by saying that the rest of my family had an amazing meal here. The atmosphere is cute, the server was very sweet and accommodating, but sadly the chef was sloppy and careless. After explaining my dairy allergy, the waitress brought me my dinner. After two bites, I felt a tingle on my lip and proceeded to fork a piece of penne, which had a long string of cheese attached to it. The waitress was extremely embarrassed and apologetic & took my entree to the kitchen, where the chef denied that there was any cheese in the dish, but begrudgingly made another one for me. The second round tasted awful and was missing the shrimp I had ordered, but at this point the rest if my party was almost finished eating, so I just let it go. The waitress was nice enough to take he shrimp off my bill, but not the entire dinner. I mean they only almost sent me to the hospital. In any case, this is a nice restaurant but steer clear if you have any dietary restrictions. Made to order? Not so much."}
{"text":"Bathroom is disgusting. Water all over floor. Dirt everywhere. No toilet paper just a bottle of glade on the sink. Restaurant space is too cramped and the booths are lumpy and sitting on the pillows is awkward. Hard to get attention of waitstaff, empty water glass the whole night. Also the strip mall location doesn't do it any favors. Food is good overall but nothing to fawn over. Overall ambiance is okay but decor and visual taste is terrible."}
{"text":"Was in this mall for business, so it was convenient just to walk over to get dinner here after I read the great reviews on this place. First, its a small family owned (I think) restaurant. There was a lot to chose from the menu and this place was packed for a Tuesday night, which is an indicator that it probably has a good following.

Dinner starts off with fresh bread with garlic spread. For appetizers we had the fried zuccini and meatballs. What a great way to start a meal! Then for entrees we had the chicken piccata, veal masala and chicken gagnoli (not sure it was grilled chicken with veggies). All were great. We topped off the meal with desert of home made ice cream. Creamy and delicious with almond flavor and bits of cherries.

Service was prompt and many others brought their own wines. The waitress messed up my order, so I had to wait for it to be redone. She thought that I ordered a pasta dish when I had ordered chicken.

I would definitely visit this restaurant again and recommend it to others. This is the best Italian food that I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the food was excellent.  Was not happy about the $32 paid for opening 4 bottles of wine.  I understand a fee should be charged, but this seemed high.  It was cool out and table was right by the door - did not make for a good dining experience.  I can't imagine what it would be like in the winter.  It's small and maximized for seating, looked like more than half of the space was for the kitchen.  They can't find another location that would shield customers from the open door at the same time giving kitchen the room they need to work? It seems that they feel like the customer should feel privileged to eat there, regardless of the conditions.  I found that incredibly odd."}
{"text":"First visit last night.  Great service, great atmosphere for such a small place, and the food is delicious! Best Veal Marsala ever, and the Grilled Calamari was awesome!"}
{"text":"Still very good food!
Still BYOB!  Love that!

Now some of the bad.
Not sure what is with the owner!  
We eat here frequently and the owner is so unfriendly and so customer insensitive. Yes insensitive!  
Polishing her nails at the counter overlooking the tiny dinning room, what's the story?  Puts her purse on the stainless steel counter were some prepared food is placed, not very sanitary!
Clueless on training the staff and how she or the staff respond to requests.
We asked for the music to be turned down a little because at our table of 4, we had a hard time hearing each others conversation.  
First request to waitress; who responded \" I don't think they will allow me to do that.\"  OK not the correct way to respond..maybe this should be worded differently!  
Is the customer important or what!   
The music was not turned down.

Later the owner came by to say hello and check on things.
Requested the music be turned down a bit.  Her response, \"We want to have some atmosphere.\"  Not the correct response, again!  Again, it was not turned down.
This place is tiny and plain and has the tables stacked on top of each other.  OK, I understand some music but not so loooooouuuuuuuddddddddddd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The good.  The food.  A bit overpriced but very well prepared.  The Chef does a great job!"}
{"text":"Bring your own bottle. Pedestrian italian, no pizza, little flavor, overpriced and way too small for comfort. Sat next to a space heater. And it's a strip mall.
 Wrote this in Feb 2012 and for some reason it is just now posting. Maybe its better now."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Great service and amazing food!!! I had the raviolis stuffed with banana peppers and sausage in a creamy tomato sauce and they were the best raviolis I have ever had! I usually automatically love BYOB places but this place was quaint, great service and great food.  Lots of menu options and the chef was even able to give suggestions and told us to \"challenge\" him.  We will definitely be going back there!"}
{"text":"Loved everything we ate here while in PA.  We must have had 2 helpings of bread with the bean dip and olive oil. It is so simple, yet so delicious! 
The caprese salad is fresh and the mozzarella is very good. 
I had the crab and angel hair with pinon nuts for my entree and my fiance practically stole it. He ordered the chicken parmesan equally as good, but just different, (obviously)  The pasta is al dente, perfectly cooked crab, olive oil/butter sauce, good parm, and toasted pine nuts. YUM!  The chicken is very lightly breaded, crisp, tender, juicy, and flavorful. Just the right amount of red sauce and cheese. 

Tiramisu! We ate so much bread and pasta and chicken, I don't know how I managed to practically lick the plate. (if we weren't in such close quarters to other patrons, I just may have) It is so good. Creamy and rich. I wish they gave you a bigger slice. :)

This tiny BYOB is cramped, always busy, and has that mom and pop, humbled, great service that feels like family is serving you. I will frequent this establishment every time we come to visit!  Try and make a reservation, especially on weekends!

You will have to work out for a week to work this meal off, but it is sooooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious.  This is truly a hidden gem and we're so happy we found it. We started with the beet salad which was very different but very good then for dinner we had the eggplant which was the best I've ever had."}
