{"text":"Maybe it was just an off night but it seems like this place is going downhill. My hubby went to pick up the beef/chicken shawarma plate for us (about $10) and it was just a mess. First off, everything was COLD (it's only 5 blocks away, it's 30C outside  AND he drove there so it's not like it chilled in transit). There was NO sauce (tahini, shawarma sauce, hot sauce...Nothing!) Just cold dry rice with meat chunks on it, and the meat portion was about half of what they usually serve. He had to remind the girl for the pita it comes with, but that proved pointless since she forgot to include the hummus (what am I supposed to do with a cold, dry pita??). The lettuce for the salad was old-looking, and the girl also forgot to give us dressing. Just a disappointing meal overall. One girl seemed new so I'll probably give them another chance but still...get it together!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff ,excellent service and real shawarma taste! The $8 special is amazing and the staff is very generous"}
{"text":"Decided to check their 'special', it was shawarma on fries. That's all, only some meat & many fries, no salad, no veggies, nothing! Was the least healthy meal for several months!  Never saw a mideterenian place that doesn't have veggies with a plate. In our health conience age of eating balanced diet this 'special' is a disgrace!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken shawarma from here. Fresh, hot and tasty! Portions were generous, the chicken wasn't dry. Prices are really good, too. Will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Will never go back. 

I watched a customer pay more than 60 dollars on her order, and all she had was a small criticism on the portions of the meal. The gentleman was great and added a bit more to the portion without issue, although the girl (younger girl) who works as a cashier, told the gentleman not to add it. All this is happening within earshot of all customers.

My problem is; when the customer confronted the girl as to why she did not want to add it or at least give her the option, even if it was an extra cost. The girl pretended not to acknowledge the customers complaint and proceeded to inform her of the total amount of the order (to get her out of the store). 

The customer continued to complain and inform the cashier that she was not providing good customer service and should learn from her co worker as to how to handle a customer. The cashier then processed the payment and bagged the food - as she completed that task, she finally acknowledge the customer and snapped. She began to yell at the customer stating that it was her moms shop and she is no longer allowed in the store. When the customer left the store the cashier began apologizing to the other customers for that customers behavior. I could not believe it. 

It was a humiliating moment for the customer, i personally could never support such a business. I will add that the girl was a young black female - not that it should change the fact that the cashier is dead wrong, but it might give some insight as to why the cashier behaved the way she did. I could play the hypothetical game all day long, but I doubt she would behave that way with an older ______ woman per say, but i digress. 

P.S - To the older Caucasian gentleman who was also a customer during the issue who jokingly stated, \"I hope she doesn't come back and shoot the place up\"... Majorly inappropriate.

I've never posted a review on Yelp. Sad this is my first. 

That incident aside, if you're a shawarma connoisseur honestly this place is slightly under average."}
{"text":"The friendliest staff, good healthy wholesome food with generous portion sizes. Definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is often a Friday night treat for me. Their chicken wrap is absolutely delicious, with a ton of great fillings, and all for a very reasonable price. Don't order the combo with fries unless you have a huge appetite--the sandwich itself is enormous. The staff are friendly and quick. I have taken away one star simply for the interior, which needs a lot of work. It's clean, but sections of the walls and ceiling have a realy ratty look (with some actual holes). Bring cash--they don't take cards."}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma, one of my favourite places for Shawarma in Toronto. The staff is also always very nice and the place is clean and up to par. I would definitely recommend this place. I come here often and I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"The best Middle Eastern food in Toronto. Quantity is huge and taste is great! Highly recommended. Delivery is always on or before time."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. I used to go all the time and it was great. I last went about three months ago and I found the quality of the chicken shawarma meat to be poor. I went back today because a colleague wanted to go. It has actually gotten worse. The meat I got was full of dried out pieces of skin. (Very gross)  Zero good pieces of chicken. I'm never going back here."}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken on fries. Flavour is 10/10 and service is generally fast. The baklava is great as well."}
{"text":"A hidden gem with some of the best middle eastern food that I've had in Toronto. 
Delivery has always been on time and very polite....which makes a huge difference. 

My fav item to order from their menu happens to be a non-middle eastern preparation: chicken and fries. You can add all sorts of stuff on it such as hummus, hot sauce, tzatziki, pickles etc. Best part is that fries are still crispy upon delivery despite of all the stuff I order on top. Sort of a Middle Eastern poutine. 

Their wraps and dinners are better than most others. Dinner comes with some very nicely flavoured rice...think it's cinnamon. Overall a great find for me to order from. Great value for money as well."}
{"text":"The old ladies who work there speak non stop loudly turkish, very little of English knowledge and they keep place dirty. They are dead slow and I saw more than 4 customers going just because of this. Chicken shawarma was tasty but turnups were not fresh"}
{"text":"Pita Ikram is simple straight forward shawarma place with decent shawarma and good prices. 
Been there few times because it's fast and easy and also decent quality.
Good place to take out and run but not so great to seat and have lunch as it's a little noisy"}
{"text":"Not the great. Really average shawarma place. Gove it a try if you are  really craving middle eastern food and too lazy to drive somewhere else."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. I love their chicken shawarma with brown rice."}
{"text":"This is probably the best shawarma in Toronto Area. As a Turkish I find this place very authentic and clean ! Try their tzatiki sauce with chicken shawarma & fries and youll be shook!"}
{"text":"I've tasted better shawarma in the neighbourhood. Mediocre customer service. I couldn't find the prices posted anywhere inside..."}
{"text":"Ordered via just-eat. Very annoyed with delivery as I had to constantly call this business to get an update. When the food arrived (30 mins late)....it was warm & soggy (no one eats a warm & soggy shawarma)! The food \"looked\" good but I feel I just got ripped off! Never again!!!"}
