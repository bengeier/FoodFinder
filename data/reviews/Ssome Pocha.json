{"text":"The fried chicken is good. Slightly over cooked. I like how light it is and not greasy. The honey mustard is good too."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate the end of exams. We ordered a corn cheese, popcorn chicken and a seafood pancake. The food was okay, not bad. However I was a little taken back by the price of the food. The popcorn chicken we got was around $30 and it seemed the plate was just full of a green onion garnish. I don't believe I'll be back again, simply because I'm sure I can find quality food for better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered the galbi dinner to go - for $13 bucks I got so much food! It was freshly grilled and ready to go in about 10 minutes. Big portions, and galbi was seasoned pretty well. The only complaint I would have is the shortribs could of been cooked a little bit longer for that crispy browned crust."}
{"text":"The Food is pricey. Spicy sausage soup is not as good as I expected. The fried chicken is really good though."}
{"text":"If you want a true taste of Korean nightlife Ssome is the place to visit! This is a Korean style pub at its truest. With a huge variety of tasty anju (drinking food)  and great service you are in for a great night! They also sell an AMAZING Korean Fried Chicken. They are also open for lunch now! Awesome!"}
{"text":"We went here with a group of five to celebrate a birthday. We ordered the veggie udon, spicy sausage stew, boneless fried chicken with green onion, takoyaki, spicy rice cake in soup, french fries and the stir-fry tofu and kimchi (this came with meat - it does not indicate this on the menu).  For this order we also got two free orders of egg and corn.   The takoyaki was good. The veggie udon was decent and I think this is one of the few dishes on the menu that was vegetarian.  The spicy sausage stew was alright; I've had better army style stews at other restaurants.  The french fries were a very small portion size considering it was $10. The highlights of the meal for me were the stirfry tofu and kimchi, spicy rice cake soup and the fried chicken (however, I still think the shallot chicken at yum yum is better).  The food overall was probably worth four stars but the meal was really pricey; it worked out to be $180 for the 5 of us considering we didn't even order meat type dishes.   The restaurant had a nice ambiance since the tables were separated into booths. There's also a service button at the table so you never have to try to get the servers attention which was nice."}
{"text":"Great little Korean \"pub\" on the edge of downtown. Everything is shared, so either be prepared to eat a lot or come in a group. Every table is almost marked off by what it looks like to be wooden fences, creating basically what it looks like to be your own private booth, but without the completely closed off feeling. Every table also has it's own buzzer, which is great, so you can notify the staff once you're ready to order or if you need anything.   We got a lot of meat dishes, but we were mostly excited to try the fried chicken as the Koreans just make it the best. Our dishes came out one after another and let me tell you, it just got better and better! I guess because we ordered entree dishes, it came with this corn dish that had a sunny side up egg. We just mixed it together and it was a great addition to the dishes and good starter. The takoyaki was delicious and definitely took me back to the street fare I got in Japan. The bbq short ribs followed by the chicken with cheese were equally amazing and blew us away as they came one after another. While I really wanted to like to fried chicken, I found it to be a little dry and felt like they might've cooked it a touch too much. It was crisp however, which is what I was looking for.   Also, highly recommend you get the raspberry wine, it is very good and you sip it like sake.  Great table sharing wine and everyone loved it. Overall, I felt like they had a good selection of food and will return again with a decent sized group!"}
