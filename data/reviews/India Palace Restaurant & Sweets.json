{"text":"Hands-down the best Punjabi (North Indian) food in the city. I'm Punjabi and this honestly tastes like home-cooked food we get in the small villages of North India - authentic, flavourful and served with a smile. My family goes to India Palace almost every Sunday and we always over-order so we can savour the leftovers for lunch for the next day or two. Don't be put off by the underwhelming decor, the fact that its way in the NE (which is far from me) and the run-down interior. This is not like the fancy over-priced Indian restaurants in Calgary, which have their place. At India Palace, you'll love the food and the family who lovingly serve you.  Saag thali is my favourite and they offer lots of gluten-free dishes like dosas, corn rotis, idlis, etc."}
{"text":"Chicken tikka masala been prepared to serve is not the original recipe on the menu/ and above all-Not at all the authentic taste. Chicken pieces strictly dry-Under cooked. It's a family restaurant-Who to ask for-see for genuine complaints.  Better avoid. There's always no consistency of the food. Quality poor/proportioning is not always there.  Poor. Poor. Poor."}
{"text":"This place is one if my favorite place to get north indian food my dad always goes and gets it when he drops me off at my afternoon activities and we go home and  enjoy would really recommend this place to anyone who likes north Indian food."}
{"text":"First time here and it wasn't terrible! I was a walk in and ordered take out.  The wait time was approx. 20 minutes which is standard.  The d√©cor and cleanliness of this restaurant could definitely use a good clean and maybe a fresh coat of paint. At this point, I don't think I would dine in.  Now the food... It was tasty.  I can't say it's the best Indian food I have had but it was good.  I ordered Fish Pakora which was delicious(I just wish it came with that yummy mint sauce that usually comes with fish pakora), Palak Paneer, Shrimp Vindaloo (My favorite dish of our meal) and Butter Chicken which I found quite bland.  Since this is so close to my home, I would probably order take out from here again but I'm going to try a few others Indian restaurants close to home before I do."}
{"text":"Good place for samosas and chaat. Rest of the menu is half decent. Clean place but water jug and glasses were not clean or looked as clean. Prices are good. Mithai(sweets) on the other hand is a hit or miss( mostly miss)."}
{"text":"Great for Indian Vegetarian.  Home cooked North Indian food.  Might take a little time to get your meal, so plan for it.  Have the Saag Thali"}
{"text":"Having experienced  excellent home cooked Indian food all my life, I have to say this is the closest we get to a gourmet Indian Take Away.  The creamy shrimp curry was a big favourite in our house, but the large samosas run a close second.    If  Vindaloo is one of your favourites India Palace has a good spicy hot Vindaloo or the medium, which is still Vindaloo, but not so hot you want to fill your mouth with milk afterward..  A hint for those who have lactose or other milk related intolerances, if you can't have milk to cut the heat after or during a spicy meal, try Mango juice.  It cuts the heat.  We chose medium hot dishes, and are pleased that at India Palace there is a choice.  Also, there is Goat curry on the menu, if you want to experience that for a rare treat.    For a delightful snack there is a type of mix of chick pea and other traditional Indian snacks  my husband calls Indian Trail mix,  The mix is rich and filling with a touch of curry and cumin that is so tasty it begs a try.  There is so very much at India Palace that is delightful and tasty,  it's worh a visit  just to see, smell and taste what they have to offer.  And yes, their take-out service is quite quick.    One of NE Calgary's best kept secrets,  India Palace is by far the best Indian  food I've had in Calgary."}
{"text":"I have tried many places around town to find a good dosa/sambar and I have found that India Palace has the best dosa/sambar in Calgary. The dining room is a small and plain room, but the service and food is what I am into here, and India Palace delivers. They have several types of dosas, but my favorite is still the masala, it is a  simple potato, vegetarian dosa that comes with a  sambar soup that I dip my dosa into because it has such an amazing flavor. The sambar is so good that I always have to order an extra bowl of it."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've ever had! Perfect amount of spice, great prices, and quick delivery. Hello to my new regular Indian delivery place. Keep up the delicious work, there are many Indian places in the area but they stand out."}
