{"text":"Absolutely the best Vietnamese food in DT Calgary. Always friendly, consistent and quick. We love #19 as the pork is amazing and the spring roles are always fresh. We also enjoy the salad roles as a starter. I would highly recommend this place and it's other locations. Great for a staff team or for two. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with the type of food that this restaurant sent out. Clearly, the chef either did not know what he/she was doing, or he/she was just uninspired with food and cooking. I think I can do a better job at making satay pho.   My boyfriend and I went there a month ago for lunch and I ordered the Satay Beef Pho - a pretty standard dish that any Vietnamese restaurant would make. I am sad to say that I have never tasted such horrible satay pho in my life. This is the first time in my life that I have stopped eating after approximately 1/4th of the dish and I never waste food.  Here is why:   1. The soup didn't taste like anything. The soup was diluted and in a disgusting colour.  2. The colour. The colour of the soup was the colour of red vinegar (that you can find in most chinese restaurants). I am no expert at Vietnamese foods, but I have never encountered a bowl of satay pho to look like a bowl of fruit punch with pink noodles swimming in it...  3. The noodles were overcooked also dyed red from the soup! This explains that they were too lazy to boil the noodles separately. Usually the noodles and soup is cooked separately so it doesn't cloud the soup. However, this time, the noodles were dyed pink from the soup.  Maybe this just isn;t their specialty... but please do not torture your customers by sending out dishes you don't know how to cook.  I wish I took a picture of it for you guys."}
{"text":"I thought it was delicious! Fast, inexpensive and super tasty. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Oriental Phoenix is my favorite restaurant in Calgary. Their grilled lemongrass chicken is to die for, completely unlike lemongrass chicken I've had anywhere else. We're also a big fan of their rice paper wrapped appetizers-- try the summer or BBQ pork rolls. The secret seems to be their sweet-sour-spicy vinaigrette. So delicious. Highly recommended.  Caveats: This place is downtown and is therefore a zoo at lunchtime as all the office workers pour into it. Come for dinner instead, they're pretty much empty at 6-7 PM. The service will occasionally keep you waiting-- not for an excessive amount of time, but it will feel like it if you come too hungry."}
{"text":"I love vietnamese food. So much so, that I have been all over Calgary trying the many varieties that have popped up in the last ten years.   I must say that out of them all Oriental Phoenix is my favourite. A family run business that has become a huge success and the owner is still as humble and friendly as ever!   I used to visit the location just off Barlow Trail on a regular basis, it was a beautiful restaurant with contemporary decor! Unfortunately, they chose to close down that location much to my dismay.   I still happily drive downtown or to the south to enjoy my favourite Pho off the menu (BBQ Pork & Chicken). It is amazing soup that includes juicy slices of pork and chicken that have been seared on the grill. The broth is just as tasty, almost enveloping the whole essence of a BBQ in one large bowl, an attribute that is often missing from other Vietnamese Pho.   The service is warm and friendly, and like most Vietnamese restaurants, the food comes fast.   If you are looking for a burst of energy, try their Vietnamese Coffee. Magnificent!"}
{"text":"We have just tried this restaurant few hour ago and we are really \"hangry\" ( hungry and angry).  There is noone at the reception desk. We have to look around restaurant before finding the server. There was less than 5 customers at our arriving however we have had to wait almost 1hour for 2 dishes (1 soup Canh Chua Tom,1 dish Heo Kho To)that I can make at home with maximum 20 min.  There is the first time and the last time for us coming here"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it first opened from being a run down strip mall with bingo and now your lucky if you find a seat at lunch and sometimes supper.   I would have to say that eight years ago it used to be more \"traditional Vietnamese\" whereas now they are getting more commercialized and the meal prices have steadily been rising. Never the less food has always been good and same owners who treat you well. Restaurant also has a bar side which is nice to enjoy for a appetizer and drinks. Overall is clean and service is decent.   As for food #23 is still the most popular abd always a great meal but if you love salad rolls or spring rolls...they're fish sauce is beyond good!   Enjoy coming here but wish they kinda would of kept that small little Vietnamese restaurant in the hole of some corner."}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese food with fast and efficient service.  It is easily as good as anything you'll find in the Vietnamese neighbourhoods in Vancouver."}
{"text":"I usually love Oriental Phoenix...not sure what has happened at this location.  We both had beef pho and we didn't find the broth to have very much flavour.  It also seems that this location waters down their hoisin sauce. Don't think we'll be coming back to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"Excellent sweet and sour chicken and authentic Vietnamese cuisine make this place a popular spot for lunch downtown. They're good for dinner as well. My girlfriend loves their chow mien. You should know if you park in the parkade across the street from the restaurant, they will validate your parking. This helps tremendously with parking rates as high as they are."}
{"text":"Oriental Phoenix is the best Vietnamese restaurant I have had the pleasure of dining at. Service is top rate, the Pho is flavorful and the Lemongrass Chicken and Beef Vermicelli are absolutely delicious. You can always spice these up to meet your tastes. In the evening, Summer Rolls are an amazing appetizer to try."}
{"text":"Been here so many times I couldn't even guess...but the last three times I have been  disappointed.  Service has slipped from fast and fresh and predictable to questionable and inconsistent and that sucks. I have always loved it here and I have always brought customers here because of it's consistency...it's gone. I hope than can bring it back."}
{"text":"Passable at best, in my opinion.   The restaurant space itself is lovely. It has nice big booths, good lighting, and it's nicely decorated.  For two of us to have tea (which was lovely), a bowl of pho each, and a salad roll appetizer (which was good) our bill came to $45.   The restaurant was not busy at 6 pm,  but it took nearly half hour for our meals to arrive at the table. Our waiter must have had a cold,  as he sniffled, snorted,  and frequently  wiped his runny nose on his upper sleeve while passing by our table.   The Special Phoenix Pho was good (but was much better AFTER I added chili oil,  hoisin, and red pepper paste - those are all available in ketchup/mustard bottles if you ask for them). The Satay Beef Pho was spicy, but it lacked any other real flavor.  In my opinion, the food and service was 3* at maximum.  Given the other nearby options downtown I don't plan to return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for Vietnamese cuisine.  We have been here several times and have gotten great service and great food each and every time.  They've done a beautiful job renovating the space which in my opinion has really classed up the mall in Silver Springs they are located in.  Try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Being in the middle of downtown, I'm not too surprised that dishes here run a bit higher than the usual Vietnamese restaurant. The food here is tasty though, I rotate between noodle dishes to rice ones depending on what I'm feeling.   Food is always fresh, service is good and gets quite busy! Make reservations if you can, otherwise I'd recommend going at 11:30 or after 12:30 to get a seat."}
{"text":"I went here at lunchtime on a weekday. Easy to get seated since there was only a small business crowd around. Food was really great. No complaints. Staff were attentive. Standard Asian restaurant ambience/decor."}
{"text":"Gone so far downhill."}
{"text":"I've been going to Oriental Phoenix for years now and I'm so stuck in my ways that I always order the same dish - #19 (barbecued pork & spring rolls w/rice vermicelli).  It's the fault of the deep-fried spring rolls - they're too good.  The spring rolls, combined with the rest of the ingredients, is the perfect match."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm, pho!   It has been years (& years) since I have had pho with any kind of regularity. My recent visit to Oriental Phoenix has me making sure I do not slip up like that again.  Spring rolls were morsels of crispy heaven (even though I should steer clear of them - the stomach wins out over the brain far too often.)  My spicy beef satay pho was perfectly seasoned. No need to add anything.  Just enough heat to it to over a nice tastebud kick, without the grief afterwards.  Service was fine. Not particularly memorable. The one down side was that at times, I though I was sitting in a walk-in refrigerator instead of a restaurant."}
{"text":"I had lunch with my co-workers here a month ago. I will never go again for these reasons: -Quality of food has deteriorated over the past few years  -Poor service overall; the server came to our table multiple times to ask what our orders were -One person's order was late by more than 20 minutes compared to the others. The manager just said sorry and moved on.  - There's an abundance of better Pho places downtown."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for about 16 years. It's delicious absolutely every time. When recommending OP to people I describe it as the \"McDonald's\" of Pho, not as an insult to OP but more as an indicator of their consistancy. You always know what you're going to get. It's our absolute \"go to\" Vietnamese restaurant.   Today, as always, we started with a pot of green tea. We ordered a #1 (spring rolls) and #2 ( shrimp rolls) and a #20 (rice vermicelli noodles topped with shredded pork, BBQ pork and spring rolls) for each of us.  For newcomers to the restaurant I recommend the above for a taste of how delish the good is here.   The other important detail is that their fish sauce isn't fishy tasting, which I think makes a huge difference to the overall flavor.  So, go check it out, and while you're there say hello to Don for me!"}
{"text":"This is probably home to some of the best vietnamese food Calgary has to offer. Their service is pretty good, and fast and they have the most delicious menu items. Honestly their pho tastes just the same as if you were to actually travel to Vietnam, and their spring rolls are to die for. I am definitely a spring roll fanatic and have had my share of different kinds from different places but nothing I have tried tastes as good as oriental phoenix's"}
{"text":"In my opinion, the oriental phoenix is the best vietnamese restaurant in the city.  They have perfect giant bowls of spicy or sweet and sour soup for when you have a cold, and every possible type of bun (noodles, greens, and meat or shrimp in a big bowl). I also recommend the hong kong style ice coffee. :)"}
{"text":"The worst service.... Very disinterested waiter.... Never seen anything like it.... Food was ok.... Never there again"}
{"text":"I go to oriental Phoenix a couple times a month and always order the same thing. #30, best beef sate in town! Just delicious! Always consistent. The service is also very good, the servers are friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"So, I had just had a bunch of lab work done, was feeling pretty queasy and had been fasting 10 hours for the tests. I know, bad opener for a foodie review but this explains why we chose this restaurant, due to location. The tests were a feat for me (I despise giving my blood away, even for my own good), so my treat afterwards was to try out this Vietnamese place that I had seen a number of times driving down 9th Ave SW. We made resos just in case, for 1:30pm. By that time however, none were needed, the place was pretty deserted. Service not bad, we were seated with the other customers who were there, all back to back in a row and nowhere near the windows to watch the street/people. I asked the waitress what the most popular dish was and was told it was the vermicelli bowls. Done even though I am a true sucker for Pho. My hubby (who snuck away from work) had the shredded beef and BBQ pork bowl. I had the BBQ pork bowl and both came with piping hot, out of this world spring rolls. Lettuce and bean sprouts were tucked underneath the noodles. Genious, as it gives the bowl some good height. YUMMY! The noodles were cooked perfectly and the BBQ pork was outstanding. I was not such a fan of the shredded pork but hubby LOVED it. He is sooo lucky, he loves almost everything. We also ordered jasmine tea which comes in a little teapot and serves 2 people for just over $2. The bowls were just under $11 each. So $25 for 2 people plus tip. Not your average Vietnamese place, very modern and industrial-like. I would give it 5 stars but I really was not a fan of the seating. Almost perfect, would come back in a heartbeat. Most of my focus anyways was right square in my bowl and no leftovers for tonight - I ate it all. :) :("}
{"text":"How many places will let you come in close to closing, enjoy a delicious meal, and then patiently wait for you to leave, way after closing time? No many, in my experience, but that's exactly what we experienced here!   Food was fantastic (even if the menu descriptions don't always help you understand what you might be ordering, they are very cute to read!) and service, as said, was great."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, 5 stars for the best Vietnamese food overall.  There are other excellent Vietnamese restaurants, but you can't beat the Phoenix for consistency and good flavor.  My brother has converted to my favourite which is number 16 shredded pork and spring rolls with rice vermicelli and the best fish sauce!  Excellent service at all times.  I had some chicken sate soup at another restaurant that was the best ever, but for consistent service and cleanliness and tasty food I recommend the Oriental Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have ate at one of the other Calgary locations a few times but that was a couple years ago. This was the first time here and I was not too familiar with the menu. I think it was similar but I couldn't remember what the different dishes were. It really isn't difficult, I just couldn't remember much about Vietnamese food. I ended up ordering a rice noodle bowl which was very good. I had the Imperial spring rolls and they were tasty and reasonably priced. We had asked for a substitution in one of the other dishes and they gladly made that change, crab for chicken or something like that. I always like that, when you can change your dish to how you want it. I am always amazed when someone says they can't make changes in a restaurant. Anyway, they did here. My son ordered off the menu and they automatically \"child sized\" his order. I thought that was good.  This place has a fairly big menu so I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, it was quite busy. Food was good, ordered a vermicelli bowl and satay beef soup. Service was good at the beginning, however, it took quite some time to get our bill. I suspect this is because of how busy they were today and only had 2 servers working.  Will likely return, the spring rolls were also great."}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese. They do a lot of food here and I usually get take out instead of dining in, but everything I've had has been great. Usually chicken pho when I'm super sick or pork spring roll vermicelli. Super good!"}
{"text":"Oriental Phoenix mostly serves the business crowd downtown, they have lots of seating but are usually totally full over the lunch hour, even with less than desirable economic conditions lately they still seem to be totally packed every time I am in there. I usually get the beef or chicken lemongrass vermicelli bowl, the food comes quickly, there's plenty of fish sauce provided with it and the spring rolls are fresh and hot. They have the standard sauces on the table so you can season and dress up your vermicelli as needed. The service is quick and friendly, for a downtown lunch spot I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"I always love going to the Oriental Phoenix. I don't work far away, so it's a go-to place for business lunches & going away parties.  The food is great - although I usually order the same thing because I know I love it (stirfried lemongrass chicken).  I wish a vegetarian spring roll came with some of the chicken dishes, but they seem to be reserved for pork/beef.   The place is always busy around lunchtime, so it's a bit of a bummer if you want to go for an impromptu lunch without having made a reservation. Look to wait about 15-20 mins for a table.  It's very quiet and peaceful in the evenings for an after-work drink, though. And they give you complimentary snacks while you schmooze."}
{"text":"Oriental phoenix used to be one of the best places to go, however since their success you can really see how many corners they have cut. The hoisin and Sarracha sauces are all very watered down and thin. When I asked my server he said \"that's the consistency they come\". This experience was extra disappointing as we were one of the first guests for the early dinner rush and they were already out of essential items like Thai basil for the pho. The service was good, yes the restaurant is clean and the decor is more modern and fresh than other Vietnamese restaurants but I think I will stick to the more authentic places now. I wouldn't consider this to be authentic anymore. Yes they've had many wonderful reviews and awards but keep in mind those were from the 90s, things have changed tremendously food portion wise and customers can tell when you are serving less than what they expect or what you have promised in previous years. Ten years ago I would've given them 10 stars but too much has changed and therefore I give them one."}
{"text":"Busy place for lunch. I can't believe it's been around for so long. The food is a little on the sweeter side probably to cater to the clientele that comes here. I would definitely come back if I was in the neighbourhood. It's a very nice looking restaurant and I'm very happy for their success in the Calgary community. I enjoyed my vermicelli dish."}
{"text":"I have been to the Oriental Phoenix many times over many years of working in Calgary.   The restaurant is open for lunch and dinner and caters to the businesses downtown.   Today is the last time I will ever try to have lunch here.  My party of four arrived at the restaurant at 11:45 AM.    At 12:15 AM, the waiter finally came to the table and collected our orders.   The waiter again came to the table about 10 minutes later and asked us what we ordered, in which we re-submitted our food order.   Our appetizers arrived, followed by two of our four dishes.   About 5-10 minutes later, a third dish arrived.   A few minutes after that, the waiter again comes to the table and asked what everyone had ordered, including myself whose food had yet to arrive.   At 1:00PM, I was late for my meeting and asked our waiter to cancel my food.     We asked to talk to a manager, in which our waiter informed us was him.   We expressed our concerns in which we all we got was \"I'm sorry\".   Excuses from there were problems in the kitchen to the restaurant was busy were provided (I have seen this restaurant much busier).   In the end, the \"manager\" would not make any adjustments to the bill for the poor customer service or the wait, other than removing the cancelled dish.  I will note that my guest enjoyed their meals, however, I will never go back and would recommend you look elsewhere for lunch options."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the lunch time rush hour, but the food took 30minutes to arrive. I was not impressed with the quality or service or the food either. \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Oriental phoenix has an ideal location in downtown, it's big and has a pleasant atmosphere, but make sure you book before you go, especially during lunch hour on weekdays. Also, some of the items on the menu, take around 25-30 minutes to arrive, so if you are in a rush, ask the server before ordering any item. This has happened to me on more than one occasion! Apart from that, I haven't been able to find anything wrong with this place!!"}
{"text":"What I liked about this place is that it is easy to access through the +15 and they have plenty of seating and can handle the lunch rush. The food is standard. its good - not amazing but good enough"}
{"text":"Went at lunch with bobo. Ordered bun with pork and spring rolls, bobo had curry beef stew.  His beef was tough and fatty, my pork seemed to be tripe - texture and flavour- and the spring rolls were tiny, soggy and fishy. Too bad.  Was here two weeks ago with C and had beef satay noodle soup which was satisfying. Maybe we should stick to our favourites, do a head to head pho comparison of everywhere in town before branching out."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food. Love... not like. Out of all the places in Calgary for it, this is hands down my absolute favorite. I will drive across the city for a taste of Oriental Phoenix. Not only is it that good, but the overall value is great and their service is second to none. If you're hankering so pho, you now know where to go."}
{"text":"Overpriced, Small portions  Chicken satay noodles?!  2 pieces of pre cooked chicken that was just placed in soup bowl.... ( I know I shouldn't have even ordered chicken...my bad) Satay soup noodles wasn't satay... just like chili oil?! ... not the satay that I expected.  Decor is modern Asian-y.... they tried to fancify Pho :-/"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is about this place. Serving a majority business lunch crowd, they get people seated fairly quickly but the quality of the food is mediocre. I've tried the vermicelli bowls with chicken, beef and shrimp with spring rolls, the won ton soup and the pho. I find the broth to be tasteless and catering to a North American palate.  The essence of flavours is just not there for me. The water also tastes very odd- yes, the ice water. I'm not sure if it's soap residue on the glasses or the ice but it has a metallic taste.  I'm not usually the type to gripe but this place lacks in quality of food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of favourite places for lunch is the lounge at Oriental Phoenix. Friendly staff make you feel welcome and valued. The food tastes great, and they even serve homemade ice cream now."}
{"text":"The food here is really good!!!.. The spring rolls are delicious!!.. And the beef in my main dish  was great too!!  Also, the location is just great. It is in the middle of downtown with access through the +15. The Service is ok. I would go back there..."}
{"text":"This is as standard as it comes for Vietnamese.  The food is always good and the service always friendly.  Its busy during the week at lunch usually so get there early."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the reception.   Very friendly.   The restaurant is very clean, even with carpet. My server was very friendly.  I ordered the GOI CUON - 3 shrimp rice paper roll appetizer.  For my main course i had seafood combination in crispy noodles.    The rice paper rolls were very good.   My main was disgusting.  It was so bad i couldn't eat it.  It had 2 shrimp, 1 piece of imitation crab that was so over-cooked it fell apart and 3 calamari rings that tasted like plastic.  The meat (which i didn't see on the menu) tastes old.    When my server brought the check, my lunch was only a 1/4 eaten.  He picked it up and walked away without a word.   Pretty sad meal.  And really poor server in the end"}
{"text":"I have a feeling this restaurant was set up to fool people that they can make Vietnamese food.  I've really eaten much better and much more authentic Vietnamese food than here at the Oriental Phoenix.    I ordered the Beef Pho and the soup was only OK for me but there was very little noodles.  The beef came in small thin pieces.  The vege that came with my pho was bean sprouts and 2 pieces of lemon.  That's it!  Where's the stalk of mint leaves?  Where's the lil' red pepper?  Where's the hoisin sauce?  I had to ask for the hot sauce and she brought the red hot sauce bottle and a mustard bottle!  Why?  I didn't ask for mustard!  This ain't a hot dog!  I paid $10.95 for my pho and not worth it!   My friend ordered a very expensive won ton soup.  A huge bowl of broth with 6 wontons for $8.95!  That's kind of pricey, don't you think?  Not coming back."}
