{"text":"Woody's has got to be one of the best Hot Dog place in the Charlotte downtown area. I have found to absolutely love the Half or Whole Italian Beef. I have NEVER EVER had one any better then this. I actually think that I am losing weight by including this on my diet.  The owners Ken and Demi are such warm and loveable people. Once you have visited their place they get to know you and you them. When you walk in the door, Demi quickly says hi with a smile and generally wants to know how your day is going. Ken is busy fixing your food but talking to you and telling jokes.  I find them not only owners of a great place to go to, but family....Everyone knows your name!  The only issue that I have with their place is, that there is not one near where I live in Concord, NC.  Once you visit, you will defintely want to go back, and back, and back. My own family knows about Ken and Demi and knows what special their place and them are."}
{"text":"Really good hot dogs here and they don't cost an arm and a leg like some other hot dog joints Uptown.  I was working on the Green the other day and wanted to try something new for lunch.  So some friends and I headed down to the French Quarter.  While wandering amongst the many food vendors i happened upon Woody's at the end of the line and decided to give them a try, the special that day, a Carolina Dog for just $2.99.  Sounded good, and i decided to get the combo, which came with fries and a drink.  The Carolina Dog was really good.  Covered with chili, onions and cole slaw on a warm fresh poppy bun, mmmmm....GOOD.  The dog was large the toppings were tasty and the bun was fresh, all making for a good experience at Woody's and all for less than $6, not bad for Uptown. And I got a free refill of my Mountain Dew. (I'm a simple man).   The fries were just OK,  they were a bit too soft and chewy for my taste, they could have been fried a little longer.  If you're in Uptown and feel the urge for a good Chicago style dog, give Woody's a try."}
{"text":"I have only had Chicago style dogs twice in my life, one was forgettable and the other was just plain old bad!    Woody's is a great visit for those who have never tried one or who have, like me, never been blown away before.  Ken and Demi (husband and wife co-owners with a wildly unpronouncable last name) have a small but ample space in downtown Charlotte.  Because of the size of the space it feels very intimate as you are able to see the food being made and get to tell the cook what your toppings are.    I had one Jumbo Vienna Beef Chicago stlye dog.  For those who are yet to discover the beauty of a Chi-dog, it is topped with bright green relish, mustard, fresh cut tomato's, pickles, sport peppers, fresh cut white onion, and celery salt.  Lots of bright flavors on top of a warm salty dog.  It is served on a warm poppy seed bun.  It's a treat!    After having a chinwag with the owners and downing the dog, I got back on line and got another, this time with spicy brown mustard.  Nice!  Now, there are more things on the menu; Beef Sandwich, Brats, etc. but I just went for the signature dish and am duly impressed. And the 101 health inspecton doesn't hurt either!  Eat Well  V-dub"}
