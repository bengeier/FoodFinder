{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  Everything made from scratch and delicious.   We had the pozole, enchiladas de queso and enchiladas de mole de pollo and the house made horchata. This place just opened and is now on our list of favorites after one visit!  Next time we'll take pictures.  Everything was so good it was devoured before we could take any!"}
{"text":"I was very sad when my favorite local Mexican spot, 32nd Cafe, went out of business after years in this location. 

The joy is back! The world is right again! El Jacal is a more than worthy successor. 

Had the Huevos Rancheros, and it was delicious. Quite different than the 32nd Cafe edition, but equally great. Service was also just as friendly - and speedy."}
{"text":"Excellent traditional Mexican food with a home made flair (just like grandma used to make). Strongly recommend this neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Super friendly staff, clean and affordable. Marking this spot as authentic Mexican food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They took my huevos rancheros out back and beat the shit out of it until it would completely submit to being delicious beyond my palettes limits. 

If you are looking for huevos rancheros and your around this spot, drop yo pants, hide yo WiFi and get your ass there for some delicious food"}
{"text":"Mole enchiladas are the best in Phoenix!! Service was great too! 
The complementary Chips are served with a great Guajillo Sala! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Southern Mexican food. Different than most of the greasy Americanized Mexican food in the area. The best part was the owner, while waiting for my take out order he brought me aqua de pepino (delicious and refreshing), homemade tortillas, and homemade mole. Everything was so fresh, made from scratch and the environment was extremely welcoming. I'm only in the area for a few more weeks, I plan on coming back a few more times!!"}
{"text":"This places what okay. Not bad for a new local places that just opened down the street from where i live at . It was kinda pricey i went with my wife and paid $50 plus tip. I would come again for a second chance!"}
