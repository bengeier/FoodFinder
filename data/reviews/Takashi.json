{"text":"Walking in, I was surprised how Jan packed this place was, it's a small spot but I heard it packs big flavours. I noticed the tables were all so close together I really didn't like thta about this place but I kept an open mind.  We started off with the won ton soup, yeah your thinking oooooouuuu won ton soup nothing special there, but the dumplings were fried and then placed into the broth, it was a nice change and the broth was well seasoned with a hint of ginger, very refreshing.  The we took the \"lips\" it's a Tuna tartar on a fried Asian basil leaf, very delicious I wish I would have taken more of them ! We also too panko breaded chicken, nothing too special but it tasted good, and a salmon tartar, the salmon was super fresh, one of the best I have tasted to date.  Our sushi platter came with a different variety of maki and nigiri, spicy salmon, avocado, tempura shrimp, crab, they were all very delicious, my personal favourite was the sushi pizza, WOW  was a word that comes to mind, everything is so well dressed and fresh. Honestly a true delight. The service was great and our waiter was very pleasant. It was abit loud but there were a bunch of Christmas parties going on. The price for everything was resonable considering we had delicious fresh food, and btw this place is a BYOB!!! I would definitely go back."}
