{"text":"I stopped by Rodney's for lunch last week and I'm glad I did.  I ate at the counter in front of employees shucking oysters.  They were very friendly and recommended some oysters to me.  They were delicious!  I also ordered the shrimp cocktail and I don't know where they find shrimp this big but they were humongous! The service was excellent - the people were very friendly and helpful in making recommendations.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"First the good: the food. I had the lobster roll, which was buttery and delicious. The oyster selection was broad and tasty as well. The crab, also very good. The lone dish that was underwhelming were the scallops, which seemed to be more of an appetizer than a main - and was very salty. 

Now the not so good - The overall vibe of the dining room seemed to be several steps below the price point. I found it way too casual for a $20+/plate spot. Staff looked to be dressed in their street clothes, and were indistinguishable from the guests (outside of the downtown sport coat crowd). 

Be sure to check out the eye opening (though unappetizing) artwork in the men's room. 

Service was also quite poor. I can give it a pass since its the first month of operations and they're still figuring it out. But we had our server confirm what we had ordered a half hour after we had ordered it and had extraneous dishes arrive at our table sometime after that. My wife's dinner arrived after the rest of us had finished our mains, with minimal apologies.

So in the end in sad to say it's a bit of a mixed review. I'm sorry Rodney, but I won't be rushing back to your hipster Red Lobster any time soon."}
{"text":"Service needs to get it's act together. We arrived at 7PM on a Friday to a half empty restaurant. They insisted that as a party of 3 we needed to sit at the bar as \"all the tables are reserved.\" For the whole hour we were there all of those tables sat empty, almost every table in the restaurant was empty but they continued to heard customers to the bar. When we inquired at the end of the meal again why we were forced to sit at the bar we got the same answer, front of house is a disaster run by disinterested hipsters with no common sense. 

Food was good but the attitude and dishonesty of the staff ruined the experience. Also we witnessed the servers handling cash and other items and then shucking oysters and grating horse radish with no hand washing, gross. Stayed away from the oysters for that reason, also the main guy shucking never washed his hands once in over an hour. Staff training seems to be missing, only reason for 2 stars is the Fish and Chips were excellent."}
{"text":"We will definitely be coming back!  We were excited to try out Rodney's on Saturday night and the entire experience was amazing.  From the minute you enter this beautiful restaurant you are greeted with incredible service and the food was so delicious.  We had the clam chowder (best we've ever had) , Atlantic and pacific oysters and John Dory for the main. Everything was was perfect.  Well done Rodney's!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. We ordered a smoked fish platter for two and 3 different kinds of oysters. Our waiter was a very knowledgeable, easy to speak to, and quick to bring us refills and such. I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The oyster choices are amazing and the salmon burger is delicious.  The \"Southern\" iced tea while good is in no way a true interpretation of American southern iced tea."}
{"text":"My husband and and I ate here for dinner for a date night. We had the lobster, land and sea entree, oysters and crime brûlée. The food was so delicious, the service was outstanding, the drink menu is great and a good selection of oysters. I highly recommend this restaurant for seafood. Good quality seafood since my husband refuses to go to Red Lobster for seafood. Great place for special occasions, date night, and groups."}
{"text":"Love Rodney's, nice variety of oysters. Service was fantastic. We got a nice tour and sampling of the oysters  available from the east and west coast. Until you sample a bunch, you might not tell the difference, but there are differences. Quite fun to learn about. Lastly, the sauces... great selection of sweet and savoury, mild and spicy."}
{"text":"I had the Clam Chowder, it came out luke warm.  
I had them reheat it but found the seafood tasted quite rubbery.. 
I definitely wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Rodney's Oyster House in Calgary is big, bright and beautiful.  I've been to both the Toronto and Vancouver locations which are amazing and I have always had a great time when visiting from out of town.  The staff is very knowledgeable and man those shuckers know their shit!  I've been to the Calgary location 3 times know since it's been open and they are right on point with oysters and seafood. The last time I was in I was educated a little bit about the oysters from Jesse who was shucking the oysters that day.  Nice beard! He was explaining to me that the oysters come straight from the farmers and on to the plate.  Pretty cool!  Definitely one of my go to spots in Calgary."}
{"text":"All in all, it was okay but I'm not sure we will rush back. Busy Friday night, nice fresh interior, service was good and quick despite a full house but menu was expensive and limited. If you like oysters you may enjoy more than we did. I agree with another poster, it's impossible to tell who works there. Seemed odd!"}
{"text":"Good lunch. Tuna tartare was the best thing we ate there. Lobster roll was just ok, crab cakes were excellent. I am not an oyster lover but there are lots of other delicious seafood issues."}
{"text":"East coast oysters, all excellent and loved wide selection of toppings. Smoked salmon was perfect and clam linguine, although a bit gritty, was also tasty."}
{"text":"This is a late review, but lunch was fantastic, a little price but when you go for the \"over the top\" experience, it was worth the extra long lunch.
Oysters, 2 dozen from the Atlantic, and 1 dozen from the Pacific(which i found sweeter,)
And all went well with the Luma White wine.

But \"little\" cretaceous critter we had was the cream de la creme. The 3 vegetable bowls were wonderful, but way too much food for 4. 

Our servers were very pleasant and attentive, as I'm sure this was their largest 4 person table they've had in a month. 

As Rodney's never seems to be very busy, and only assuming because of the economy and pricyness( is that a word) LOL

We had a great time, and enjoyed every minute of it."}
{"text":"I ate here last night for the first time with a friend. They did an amazing job with this room considering it used to be a night club. Very warm and comfortable and somehow felt like we were on the coast. The food was excellent, oysters, vino, calamari and smelt and the wedge salad. especially enjoyed the salt and pepper smelt! Maybe not the best value as i left still hungry, but i will return."}
{"text":"This place is aweaome! We ordered their fish & chips which was crispy and not greasy, the fries were so good we ate all the fries, which normally some fries always gets left behind. The coleslaw however needs more work, it's not ceramy and lacked flavor. The crab cakes were delicious! Not to dry but could use a little more sauce due to the size of the crab cake, they use 3oz of pure dungeonless crab meat with no breading inside to bind it. So its quite big and filling. The apple slaw served on top gives a great texture of crunch and slight sweetness to compansate the slight heat you get from the sauce served with the crab cake. Their Scallops were superb! Cooked just right not over done and served with broccolini and i think swiss chard? Almost gives a slight southern feel. Their raw oysters were awesome! Served on a tray of crushed ice and fresh horseradish and lemon wedges. They serve with their in house made sauces, which goes from mild to hot. They also have a vodka infused with peppercorns and citrus peels sauce for a slight punch to your oysters. The server Cedric (hope i spelled ot right) was amazing funny and entertained us with him showing how to shuck an oyster and educated us on differences of the origins of oysters served. He was a great waiter and a memorable one. This is a must try. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I was here as part of a corporate function and we stayed for a great seafood dinner (5 in our party)

Started with an appetizer of assorted smoked seafood , including tuna, oysters, salmon, and mussels...really good for a starter.  We paired these with Cannonball Cabernet Sauvignon...

For main course we all shared a Dungeness crab, lobster, and scallops which were all amazing.

Great friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Calgary is a bit of a challenge for this pescatarian, so when a friend explained that Rodney's was in town, I thought I'd check it out...on Valentines Day nonetheless, with all the love-sick oglers. 

First, I was taken by it's relative elegance since I was expecting a seafood shack. It was large, open, warm and quite lovely. 

I sat at the galley bar to avoid any wreckless cupids. Cedrick, my bar keep, was extremely friendly and quite well versed in the varieties of oyster. It was quite the presentation and he never missed a beat on service. 

Chef Robin recommended the smoked salmon and indeed it was perfect. And while it was served with accompaniments, it stood deliciously on it's own. Then I ordered half plates of both the shrimp and scallops. The shrimp were large, succulent and perfectly cooked and seasoned. My favorite, however, were the scallops. Perfectly seared and served atop a lovely mix of sautéed veg. 

I was quite full and satisfied...until one of the many friendly and bustling servers insisted I try the special banana cream pie dessert served in a small mason. This was bruleed-banana-topped perfection. Please put it in the main menu! 

Suffice to say, I will frequent regularly."}
{"text":"Best seafood in Calgary!  Came during happy hour and great selection of oysters (super fresh and delicious), jalapeño crab poppers and shrimp cocktail.  Even had periwinkles which my husband hadn't seen since he lived in the UK.  Also the ambiance and interior is super chic looking and comfortable/inviting as well as friendly staff.  We'll definitely be back and make this a regular stop :). Oh an amazing French bread to start out with!"}
{"text":"Great lobster, a bit pricey, but if you like the good stuff and wont mind paying a premium, on any land lock area, this is as fresh and good as it gets."}
{"text":"Went in last night to check out Rodneys in Calgary.  We have been to the Vancouvr location, and my hubby had also been to the Toronto location.  By far this location is HUGE.  Ideal setting to host an event, with plenty of bar options later into the evening.  Decor and ambience was in-line with all new restaurants in Calgary these days; white and bright with grey hardwood.  Very clean and modern looking.  Interesting erotic images in the washroom to boot?

Upon arrival, we were not impressed as it was 9pm and we had to stand for about 10min to be seated.  It was not busy, so unsure why it took so long? once we got seated, our server was pretty good.  The oysters were amazing. Pricey for sure, but fresh fresh fresh.  We found out that they buy them directly from the farmers and have them fedexed in.  Impressive!  Many choices to top the oysters, great flavours.  We also ordered a few other things to try.  Scallops were not worth it, overcooked and salty.  Garlic prawns were average, nothing special. The lobster roll was also good but pricey. 

Overall would go back, but will stick to just the oysters next time!"}
{"text":"This was.my very first visit to this restaurant. I was greeted by barely legal hosts and directed to my table. I chose a bottle of wine and was ensured that it was one of the best.wines they have. $58 bottle at Rodneys you can find in any liquor store for about $15-17 so come on...
Now the food. I had tuna starter that was very good, my friends smoked fish was average. His chowder had too much potatoes not enough seafood but it tasted good. Our mains were nothing special, my mussels were slightly overcooked. All together for $160 it was rather average experience."}
{"text":"Great dinner place!! It is nice that it is a little out of 'downtown' and so parking is easier.  The atmosphere is great! The waitstaff is super friendly and knowledgeable!! And the food was DELICIOUS!!! My dinner partner ventured into the oysters and clams and LOVED every bite! And I stayed with the more mainstream fish and chips and loved my meals as well!! I would definitely recommend it and definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food was just not good. Don't mind paying the prices if the quality is there, unfortunately it wasn't. 
Staff was friendly and attentive though."}
{"text":"Here today enjoying Rodney's Oyster Festival! Kicking off summer with great food, patio tunes, fresh oysters, DJ and live band. Summer can't start any better."}
{"text":"Came here once with my cousin from out of town, I usually don't care for seafood but it was a good change from the usual spots I tend to go to.
I ordered the lobster roll which was yummy but the fishy flavor was over powering. It was pretty cool how they taught us how to shuck oysters, not a fan of oysters but Yolo."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I really liked Rodney's in Vancouver.  I was really excited when this was opened right by my work place.  Nothing compares to Vancouver.  Oysters weren't good.  Food selection was very small.  Waited a long time for food."}
{"text":"So excited to have a Rodney's in Calgary! I've been to the one in Vancouver a few times so I was excited to try it! Had a dozen oysters to start (a must!) we just let them pick for us cause we're no oyster experts. We had ones from Nova Scotia, PEI and BC, all nice and fresh. We had the Clam Chowder which is amazingly delicious! Definitely the best I've had in Calgary! 

The last thing we had was disappointing. We had the Seafood Hotpot which was on special. It tasted fine but for the price it was tiny! 2 shrimp, 2 clams, 2 muscles, 2 small pieces of fish with a few boiled potatoes for $26! Seemed like a rip off when we've had steamers there that came with over a dozen for only $15.. Definitely won't order that again!!

Other than that everything tasted great! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Five stars for happy hour oysters and prosecco! $15 gets you half a dozen oysters and either a red, white, rose wine, draft beer or prosecco. Extra points for the beautiful environment, freshness of the oysters, and the fact the bubbly was just popped and filled up the flute. I saw another table order happy hour priced eats - scallop siders, fish tacos and calamari. All the food looked good."}
{"text":"Just went there tonight. The food was below average for what they charge you for. Service was also VERY VERY poor. My friend and I got seated and had to ask for who our server is after sitting there for 15 mins. We had to wait another 35 mins to get our appetizer--raw oysters which you would think it would be rather fast. After finishing our entree with minimal interaction with the server, I had to chase our server down to get the check. I understand that they just opened this location, but for an upscale-casual chain restaurant, I would expect a much better service than that. It seems like the staff selection is not the best either. I don't understand what the hype is but very disappointed. Sorry never going back again."}
{"text":"Best oyster place in town! Come every Thursday for all fresh oysters and other seafood"}
{"text":"I hate to admit to...but I blew it. My amazing, wonderful, handsome boyfriend made reservations to take me to Japanese Village for my birthday. Where you need to be on time...and I run 10 minutes late...always. So we missed our reservation.

After some grumbling...from both the mouth and tummy...we settled on going to Rodney's. We had been in Vancouver recently and had a great meal, and were able to quickly book a table online. Our server was great and was able to make suggestions for oysters. We enjoyed shrimp cocktail, mussels, an awesome NZ wine. It was a delicious meal and we will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience from beginning to end! Service was impeccable. Servers knowledgeable with great suggestions and the food delicious. We had oysters, lobster roll and crab cakes. Each dish was spot on!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I just love coming here, its so welcoming and delicious. I've been heading to Rodney's for a few years now, been lucky enough to have gotten to know the staff really well, never seen a high turn over which is always nice to see in this industry. 

As soon as you walk in the doors you enter a seafood lovers heaven, the bar is shaped like the head of a ship, I suggest grabbing a seat if theres an open spot right there. Rob has been my shucker for years, always has a big smile on his face when you walk up. Ask for the oysters and you'll never be disappointed, there always fresh and they have there own in house sauces to dress them up or down however your heart desires! 

Love this place would never go anywhere else for a seafood meal because you just can't beat it! Keep up the amazing work Rodneys Team!"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch at Rodney's Calgary today - a killer Manhattan clam chowder, and some fab oysters shucked expertly by Trevor. Service was excellent, and the food arrived in a timely manner. The staff seemed genuinely concerned to make sure I had everything I wanted. I've eaten at 3 out of four Rodney's (Toronto, Vancouver, Yaletown), and I can say that Rodney's Calgary performs solidly as a the newest Rodney's. Love having them in Calgary! 

I gave them only four stars for two reasons - their bread is a plain boring white bread. It doesn't compare with the sourdough at Rodney's Vancouver (I know, they're not directly related). And, on a previous visit, I wanted to order some to-go items from the main menu, but take-out options are limited to what is on the menu of the connected take-away counter only."}
{"text":"If you love oysters, and/or a wonderful, over-the-top dining experience, then you have to eat at Rodney's!  I suggest you sit at the Oyster Bar and talk to Rob, who shucks the oysters.  He is as friendly and as personable as anyone can be and he seems to genuinely like talking to folks about oysters.  We sat at the bar and ate our way through one pound of steamed mussels, and a platter of a variety of oysters, which were from Maine, Massachusetts, PEI, New Brunswick and New Zealand.  DH ordered a second round of oysters after deciding which ones were his faves from the first round.  He then had the lobster roll and I had the fish and chips.  Everything tasted freshly made and we enjoyed it all.    Service was the best you could ask for and Rob made it an \"extra special\" dining experience. This place can rival or better any restaurant we have tried in Vancouver or Halifax.  And the best part is that we do not have to get on a plane to get there!!!  There's also a small gift merchandise area just inside the front door, too, that carries T-shirts, oyster shuckers and wooden oyster boards.  Worth checking out if you are an oyster aficionado!"}
{"text":"Big space, friendly staff, food quality was excellent. I had the salmon mac burger which is like a Big Mac but with salmon instead and much more delicious. Nice place."}
{"text":"Great fresh seafood and friendly staff. Ample seating available so there's no need to wait. Had a great experience when the sweet GM comped us some oysters to sample. It's definitely a splurge, but if you haven't been, it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I came here with my person,  and we over ordered.  We ordered 3 types of oysters,  beef tartar,  stramed mussles and clams,  clam chowder,  and fish and chips.  

The server we had,  took his time and explained the sauces we can use for the oysters.  I believe there was 6+ more sauces and most of them were good!  I totally forgot the oysters we have chosen but they were clean and so fresh!

While we were waiting for our food,  one of the managers(?) gave us a free sampler of the steamed mussles.  It was really good and made me excited to eat the dish. 

Everything was good.  The sauce the mussles and the clams were cooked in was cooked to perfection,  the tartar was creamy and had the right seasonings.  The clam chowder was good as well! The Cole slaw that was a side for the fish and chips was soooooo good.  I was so full but I couldn't stop eating! 

I really wish they had some sample platters that was available. But I couldn't complain anything about this place!"}
{"text":"Oh god, the food poisoning. Management was rude, unsympathetic, and generally clueless."}
{"text":"I have been excited to try Rodney's since we saw the sign go up months ago and finally made my way there tonight. After being seated we had to wait almost 15 minutes for our server who didn't seem to be in any rush. This lack of immediacy was a theme throughout the meal. 
The oysters were very fairly priced and they had a huge selection. The menu although small was nice but it would be good if they had some mention of side dishes as there isn't one. 
The decor was lovely and the space is very airy and inviting. 
While the service was not great I would go back for oysters and s drink but maybe not a whole meal."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best restaurants I have been to. 
Staff is friendly and knows their stuff."}
{"text":"The oysters were fresh and tasty, and the sauces are amazing and unique! great service and beer to match. Does not look like much on the outside, but the interior is space and with a lot of character. Clean and comfortable. A must try in Calgary!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I suck. I'm an adult with a career but for some reason we celebrate our relationship every month. I would use the term \"Monthiversary\" but I already hate myself enough. Anyways we like food. I lived in LA and New York for awhile so I'm a total douchebag and I fancy myself a foodie, AKA -think my tastes are better and more refined than anyone else's, especially when it comes to food. In my opinion Rodney's has coast worthy, mouthgasmic eats. Anyways we like Rodney's so much we go there more than once a month, we often fight about really important issues like who is a better cribbage player and how rude it is that my 13 year old dog (that I f***ing bottle fed) likes him better than me, so we go out for a lot of makeup dinners too. Anyways the staff at Rodney's are super nice and haven't tried to light us on fire yet so I think they're kind of the top bar of service. Be honest if you met us you'd want to light us on fire. Enjoy Rodney's!"}
{"text":"I first checked out Rodney's oyster house with my sister and from the moment I walked in, I LOVED it. The first thing I noticed was how homey and open the atmosphere was. It literally made me feel like I was back visiting somewhere on the coast. Everything from the decor to the open oyster bar in the middle was nostalgic and amazing.  We ordered a couple different things (oysters, pasta and soup) so that we could try more of the menu and all of it was delicious. So much so that we ended up ordering a second round of oysters.  Rodney's definitely didn't disappoint! I'd say the only downside would be that it is a little bit on the pricey side but at least the food is good, opposed to paying more for bad food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food; great variety of oysters; excellent service from a very knowledgeable young man with a moustache."}
{"text":"My dad and I went here for dinner last night and our experience was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. From the moment we walked in we were warmly greeted by the hostess and the great service continued throughout the night. The atmosphere and decor was wonderful. The food was EXCELLENT and the manager, Brad stopped by our table to check in on us.   Anyone who loves seafood must check it out! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We loved the oysters. The decor was cool and had the sea/warf like feel with a classy modern twist. The service was excellent too! We have visited Rodney's in Toronto as well and loved the oysters as well. 
Since we never had a dinner in the Toronto restaurant we thought we would give it a go this time. A lot of the menu looked appealing but we settled on the dinner for two special which was a blue cod with veggies. We also chose to add a couple of scallops on top. 
The fish was a whole fish, which my wife and I are not really keen on. It kind of turned her away, having this dead fish staring at you while you pick the meat off its bones. That also becomes the issue, you're picking bones out of your teeth. It was well prepared and well presented. We just wish we knew it was going to be a whole fish meal. It also really wasn't enough for two people. We left with a craving for more food. It also could have been seasoned more. 

Still the oysters! You gotta go for the oysters!"}
{"text":"Recently I ventured out to Rodney's Oyster House for lunch. A newer restaurant in Calgary that is all seafood all the time. I was not disappointed. Living here you just get used to paying more for seafood and the prices are on par with other restaurants offering seafood. And you also expect the seafood to be good. 

As soon as you walk in it's light, airy, spacious and welcoming. I loved the decor with the whimsical furniture and oyster bar in the middle of the restaurant - it's all very nautical and the perfect atmosphere. We were greeted right away and seated. Very friendly staff and attentive.

We tried some of the oysters to start after recommendations by the server. I found the condiment rack they brought out very cool (just a minor distraction) and quite enjoyed the pepper flavoured vodka as a topper for my oysters. I made sure to sample all the condiments and they were all tasty. The oysters were delicious.

For lunch I had the tuna tacos. After assembling I topped mine with a little squeeze of the charred lime on the plate - it added the perfect finish. Fresh & simply delicious.

What a great experience for my first visit to Rodney's. I do have to say the pictures in the bathrooms kind of took me by surprise and didn't seem to flow with the nautical theme lol, but in the end no bigs.

Will be back and hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Really fantastic oysters and mussels.  Favourite seafood place in the city.  It is pricey but it's worth it for the high quality.  The restaurant is also food for big groups.  The seafood platters were definitely on the pricier side considering what you get. I've ordered the platter for 2 and for 4 and I found them to be overpriced."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and I was surprised that there are hardly anyone here. Its not busy at all, unlike the Vancouver location. We ordered mussels and lobster rolls. Well they ran out of the lobster club house and we were told the lobster roll is better. I have to say the Lobster Roll was delicious. mussels are so so and not like wow

The menu is totally different from the Vancouver location. I have to say the Vancouver location is better. Again, Calgary isn't big on seafood and there are not a lot of seafood restaurants. 

Its not bad. But I really love the lobster roll. Only issue is that its very small."}
{"text":"Been meaning to come here for quite a while now after seeing pictures of their food on my fb feed. Been craving for oysters forever. Our server was great, and he took our orders promptly and was patient with us as we weren't sure of what to get. We let him pick the oysters for us as we weren't sure what to get. I got the clam chowder to start which was fabulous! Clams with every bite. Super yummy. The bf one of their white plate specials; the beef tenderloin \"carpetbagger\"; he said it was good, had to search for the cotuit oyster though as it was buried under the demi glace hollandaise. 

Our server gave us a great explanation of the sauces for the oysters before they arrived. Sadly, a waitress from another table took them away quickly from us. She grabbed them off our table without asking. All she said was that they would bring it back if you have oysters. I understand that another table might need them, but we were in the process of reading the sauces and trying them to see which ones we would be using for our meal. Thank you for so rudely interrupting what we were doing. What frustrated me was that I saw some sitting on empty tables, she could have just easily walked a few meters further for it. Oysters were great though when they did arrive.

It took me a while to seek out a washroom, the pack of servers didn't seem to notice me looking lost, and they didn't give me the best directions from my table. Three servers later, I found a washroom! Very interesting washroom decor for sure... you'll understand once you see it. 

For the prices we paid for the food, I expected better service. Gonna continue looking for a better oyster bar in the mean time."}
{"text":"I was not super impressed with this place. The decor is fabulous, but the food was sub par. They charge expensive prices and didn't offer anything that was semi neutral for a person who doesn't want shell fish. There's no chicken and only one steak choice.
No salmon or tuna steaks, just cold smoked salmon. 

The service was amazing and made up for it a lot. It's still not a place I would return too."}
{"text":"Very tasty and appropriately prepared food. I enjoyed the Scallop dish and the scallops were so perfectly prepared, flavourful, and complemented the vegetables beautifully. It was delicious. I really enjoyed the fresh seafood in landlocked Alberta :) Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Coming from Toronto and also being a huge Rodney's fan, I had to give them a go! The location is prime and you can't miss it at the corner.  As we entered the restaurant, was greeted right away from their friendly hostesses.  I had made reservations online and we were seated immediately. The decor was mostly clean white with wood furnishings.  It was really pretty inside and quite comfortable of an atmosphere. 
Our server was great and she took our drinm orders promptly. Their housemade lemonade was tasty!  They also have a nice wine list to pair their menu with.
We ordered a few dishes to try: new England clam chowder,  lobster roll (had to order 2!), tuna poke, bison tartar, pan fried oysters and fresh oysters!  We let our server pick out our selection. Everything was good but I will admit my favorites were definitely the chowder and the lobster roll!  
I was a little disappointed that their lunch and take out menus offered different selections and next time I will need to ask why.  Especially since the take out menu us only offered a other times. Odd!
Also a little note to those bringing children, the washrooms have some very provocative art work selections.  I suggest using the wheelchair washrooms when taking your children. Don't say I didn't warn you!
Overall a fun experience! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came with my wife to celebrate our anniversary. We came early and were seated promptly with great attention from the staff.  I was a bit worried based on the other yelp reviews that I read, but our server was super helpful, funny, personal and all around awesome. We started with some very tasty chowder, oysters (go for the east coast ones), fried clams and smoked salmon. I'd skip the smoked salmon next time around. We moved into mains with a Thai based mussels special of the day which was very tasty!  We also had a large order of the scallops, which was the only dish that was disappointing as the scallops were pricey, small and a bit overdone. We also planned on ordering the lobster roll and the pasta clams dish but our server who was super cool in cautioning us from ordering too much. We did go with the lobster roll as well, which was alright, it did have good chunks of lobster but the roll was a bit too buttery for my taste.

Hearing that we were celebrating our anniversary, Sedric bought us a mousse dessert that was very nice. Overall a very enjoyable experience, with exceptional service."}
{"text":"Tried the lobster roll, oysters, calamari and Cesar salad. This spot had very good reviewers on Yelp and I walked in with high expectations. I was not disappointed. The service was fantastic. The food did not disappoint. All in all, a great place for a seafood dinner! We will definitely be back during our next visit!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience, and service was great.  However, we weren't too impressed with the food.  Found some of the oysters to be quite salty, clam chowder just tasted like cream, and lobster roll was quite bland."}
{"text":"About time!!!! Finally some great seafood in Calgary.
Rodney's never let me down in Toronto and it's great to finally have it here. The selection of oysters is fantastic and their menu has so much to offer to the seafood lover and those interested in acquiring the love of all things ocean!!"}
