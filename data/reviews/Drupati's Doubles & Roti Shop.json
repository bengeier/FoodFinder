{"text":"I went there twice and the chicken roti paratha  was da best the salt was less but who really cares about da salt food was good and spicy and plus doubled super Spicy and perfect I will come back soon"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

Good:
The doubles are amazing! Remember to get the hot sauce as well. I like to get it on the side to control the amount. 

Bad:
I thought the curry chicken tasted watered down and needed more flavour. The parking lot is terrible and always busy."}
{"text":"Got a roti and is was drenched in gravy.  Called the restaurant because it got all over my clothes. They said next time have to ask for light gravy...have gotten rotis in the last and never had this problem! Seems like best place for anything is good ol USA! Canada needs a lot of improvement. Stuff here is so substantial...."}
{"text":"Tried the boneless chicken curry roti and the doubles, and both were delicious! While we were there, they also had cassava (yucca) cake still warm from the oven. Sooo good! Place is simple, but plenty of seats if you want to eat in."}
{"text":"ahh, hello!! they moved West to Woodbine Downs Blvd! off Hwy 27! I heard the food is very good , and reasonanbly priced"}
{"text":"Crowded at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. The whole plaza had a line of cars waiting to park. Had a curried goat roti here on Saturday. Wonderful!!! I star off because they didn't list  the no-bone version on the menu but it's available and the callaloo side dish was awful. 

Better than Roti-Roti next door, which also had a line and good doubles."}
{"text":"I came in for a Shark 'n' Bake after watching Bizarre Foods. Not as weird as previously thought but man was it ever good. Lots of hot peppers, the bread was pretty tasty, the shark not so plentiful, but very flavourful. 

Next time I'll likely go for the Doubles as that seemed to be a real hit with the locals."}
{"text":"Top 10 doubles in Toronto. The new location is great, they keep it very clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"I would give this a 3.75 star :).... It was pretty decent. These guys have moved into a new bigger and better location with alot of nice seating and a clean restaurant look. 

I was there for lunch and as usually it was quite busy. As a side or appetizer I ordered a Double and Pholourie and for the main dish I went with their Curry Duck roti. Everything was hot and fresh. The doubles and Pholoirie were really good. Then came the Duck roti which was very nice. The duck come in bone-in so if you are a fan of boneless dont go for this. 

Over all very good experience.


For my Muslim folks - They have a halal sign on the door and I asked the cashier lady and she stated everything is halal."}
{"text":"On days where I'm living on the change in my pocket, I come here to Drupati's Doubles & Roti Shop..because despite being broke, I still get FED!

The doubles here huge, the size of a large flask with twice the thickness. 
My buddy Ricardo first took me here, I had no idea what doubles were. I was anticipating to eat two things. Only logical, right?

I found out this was a Trinidadian restaurant, also specializing in Guyanese-Chinese catering? A doubles here is less than three bucks, which makes the most food for the least money that I know in all of the GTA!
All the meat is Halal, but I don't really care whether it is or not. 
I was confused as hell the first time I got my doubles. 
\"I didn't know Trinis' ate tacos\", I thought. But man, this was so much better than tacos or any burrito. 

The storefront is small, ghetto furniture, small parking lot for customers using the plaza. Posters of ebony events litter the window, yet I'd rather be here for lunch on a sunny day than any patio near lakeshore. When the price is right, everything else becomes immaterial. The staff here are friendly, and the service is quick.
There are some rice dish, curry goat and such, but the selling point has to be the doubles. I haven't found anywhere else in Toronto that's comparable in terms of taste and value.
I guess this isn't Toronto, it's Etobicoke. GTA then!
The roti is alright too!

So far, I am the only full blooded Chinese I know who frequent here, and I don't mind keeping it that way."}
{"text":"Once in a while I crave the Trini style roti, usually frequent a place in Brampton.  But my carribean friends always recommend one particular place. Drupatis,  this location to be specific.  So, was in my old hood and finally got to try this place.  After a bit of searching, they were renovating or re-locating?  Not sure, but the sign on the address said they moved a few units down.  A place with a sign that said roti roti?  I'm
Assuming it's one in the same.  Anyways, I ordered 2 doubles and a small curry chicken roti.  The girl at the counter was very friendly and patient.  The roti is definitely the best I've had, delicious spice and a generous amt of boneless/cartilage free chicken.  The only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5, is because it's in rexdale. Jk"}
{"text":"I drove from Detroit to visit family and get some good food.  They shorted me 3 doubles.  This is not the first time they have done this, according to my family. To me this is theft, pure and simple."}
{"text":"Fresh food
Delicious Caribbean flavours 
Friendly 
Cheap
Super close
Quick
And they didn't mind giving me extra hot sauce 
Can you say habanero ?"}
{"text":"The curry chicken roti is the best I have ever had. Tender chunks of chicken breast in a mild curry sauce. Ask for medium spice which will give it some major kick. 

Really friendly staff and patrons. The only downside is the location. The tiny parking lot becomes a zoo on Friday and Saturday.  Try a weeknight if you want to get in and out fast."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and that's only because I live in the east end. They have the best doubles in town by far. I came during lunch on my last visit and there were a few people ahead of me but I still got my doubles very quickly. They are very nice and they also sell tickets for different fÃªtes and parties. If you have a large order definitely call ahead. This place is hectic on a weekend and the parking lot is madness so plan accordingly. Definitely worth a trip. I'm already salivating thinking about doubles"}
{"text":"Love it, place is such a dump but the food is excellent best location of the chain by far."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and I have yet to be disappointed.  

At Drupati's they offer a wide variety of everything you can think of.  I usually get some curry chicken, buss up shut (paratha roti), aloo pie's, and doubles.  Now of course this isn't all for myself, it's meant to be shared.  But when I do share it, it get's thumbs up across the board.  The chicken is moist and flavorful.  The curry is nice and has a little kick to it.  Their doubles are great and aloo pie is off the charts as well.  They also make some of the best buss up shut I have ever tried.

It's tough to find top quality West Indian Roti shops, but Drupati really shows you the heart of Trinidad when eating at this place."}
{"text":"that place is garbage. Had ordered 3 wedding sized roti, one hold  week  in advance, got there clerk telling me they don't make wedding roti, asked to talk to someone else told me they have the order but they ran out of whole wheat, mean to say you could't inform the customer???"}
{"text":"look the food is good, but the service remains typical. poor, poor,poor. Not sure they can become anything better. Now Radica's is amazing  and always consistent without the drama."}
{"text":"By far the best doubles in rexdale if not in the whole GTA.....fast friendly service.  Will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Good food. I had the doubles and chicken roti. Pepper sauce not that hot but tasty. You can find roti shops just as good. I will come back if in the area. I don't get why people would line up to eat here tho. 

Service is typical for West Indian restaurants but I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"This place closed up shop and relocated, which is a welcome change. The food wasn't bad, but just sub-par. This was made obvious by their neighbors at Roti Roti. Drupati's wasn't bad but little things like the over-salting, dry chicken and mushy doubles were a real turn-off. Felt like fast-food."}
{"text":"I live there food

Have been coming here for more than 10 years it's amazing, the people are so nice and polite I would definitely recommend my friends and family here if they were craving a good roti"}
{"text":"They make excellent dhalpuri here. It's so good. Soft and nice. The buss up shot was just ok. The curry is tasty with the right amount of salt to bring out the flavor. I have had the curry goat (boneless) and the curry chicken (boneless), but the curry goat is better. The doubles were mediocre. The doubles at ACR Roti are much better. I wouldn't have doubles here again. I also recently had the stew chicken with rice and peas, macaroni pie and callaloo. It was good. The pie was nice and cheesy, lots of chicken and the callalloo was tasty with little sweet pieces pumpkin. Definitely better than having to cook all that yourself. Well worth the money. My friend at the fish soup and he really enjoyed that. Overall its a spot we hit up whenever we're in the area."}
