{"text":"I'm not a big \"chase the food truck\" person but have eaten at this one a couple times at events - had a breakfast wrap sandwich thing once and lately have been into their tacos.  They have some way cool sauces, the pork belly taco was most excellent and the mac n' cheese one while a bit bland was an interesting combo.  Plus, you can't beat their prices,especially for any two tacos or any three tacos.  

The only downside is \"quick, cheap, good, pick only 2\" - here you definitely get \"cheap\" and \"good\" at the expense of \"quick\" because the truck is so popular it gets backed up with orders, and sometimes they seem to run out of meat or something and the guy has to cook up a whole new batch before he can proceed with order-filling.  So if there's a crowd, be prepared for a little wait."}
{"text":"I really need for there to be an app where you can find all of these yummy food trucks instead of just lucking up upon them! 
We sampled& shared the KimChi fries, the frites, fried mac&cheese, pork belly, and shrimp tacos.

KimChi fries- EXCELLENT, they were so delicious! I'm hoping that they serve this in the actual supper club because I lovvvvveeee them!!! Super tangy and flavourful! Worth tracking the truck down for those alone.
The Frites- I loved the peppery spice on them. They are quite peppery, but that's what I loved about them. If you love black pepper, you'll love these.
Fried Mac&cheese- weird concept but somehow totally works. Needs a little something I can't put my finger on as far as flavor, but still could eat it again for sure.
Porkbelly- I prefer a little crunch with my porkbelly, but flavor's out of this world. Yes!
Shrimp- this was my least favourite. There was allspice or something I didn't care for so I probably won't order it again, but still not terrible. Others could easily disagree and like the spice I did not. 
The truck staff was friendly and engaging as well."}
{"text":"I had the pierogi and the fries. They were delicious!! I was drunk and the guys were super nice! I gave a homeless man a pierogi and he seemed to enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"Food trucks sketch me out in general and it took me a while to come around. I've had a few great eats from the Touch truck at various CLE events. The service is always good and the food is always great. Good flavors, decent portions. Keep doing your thing, guys."}
{"text":"Love the fries and the sauce. Perogies were okay they were kind of clumped Together but we did get a to go order. Tacos were good too! Open late after bars close in Ohio city make sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"The gourmet food truck craze is reaching a frenzy in other parts of the country, so I'm glad to see it starting to catch on here in Cleveland! 

The Touch Supper Truck is the on-wheels offering from the people at Touch Supper Club. You should expect the menu to vary from night to night, but last night they served a few different gourmet tacos, a couple of burgers, chicken wings, and fries (both regular and sweet potato).

I had the Chorizo Stuffed Banana, Whipped Goat Cheese, and Borboun BBQ Aioli taco, which was really delicious. My friends got the Kimche Chicken with Touch Sauce taco, the Kimche Beef taco, and the Korean Burger, and everyone thought they were fantastic (the praise from my friend who got the Kimche chicken taco was particularly gushing). We also got the Touch Belgian Frittes (french fries) which were some of the tastiest fries I've had in a while - and the Spicy Aioli was incredible! Next time I would get the sweet potato fries, though, because they looked really good.

They weren't particularly busy when I was there, so I had a chance to chat with the chef after we got our food. He was very friendly and willing to listen to feedback - they're still new at this food truck thing. He mentioned that they don't currently have a way for people to track the location of the food truck, but they will probably start posting to a twitter or facebook profile soon.

The down side to this truck is its price. The taco I had was $7 and the portion was on the small side given the price. I don't mind paying that much for good street food, but I would have been happier with a somewhat bigger portion. The fries were pretty well sized, however, and two orders fed five of us comfortably. The drinks, at $3/each, were pricey as well. You shouldn't expect to get a full meal here for less than about $12.

Overall though, I would happily revisit this truck. They have the flexibility to show up at all kinds of interesting venues (we saw them at the 78th Street Studios open studio event), and I ultimately don't mind paying a little extra to have some really delicious food at a venu that otherwise wouldn't have as good (or any!) other options."}
{"text":"Amazing. Ok so I will admit it, I had been drinking before I had the Touch. Heavily that is, but it doesn't matter. This is legit in whatever state your body is in. 

I had the Asian style taco and a braised beef taco. I really liked the smokey beef taco and its simple tastes were just the thing I needed that night. 

BUT the Asian style taco was mind blowing. Like hey, there is my mind, then BAM, blown away. It was that good. It was salty and sweet with a little kick from the sauce they put on. It was amazing, plain and simple. I want it again so bad I am contemplating the drive as I type thi..."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS TRUCK! Touch Food Truck honestly has some of the BEST tacos!! They are seasoned to perfection. They have a variety of tacos, shrimp, beef, chicken, pork, etc. the price is perfect!! Love this truck!"}
{"text":"My friends and I shared the pierogis. The caramelized onions were super tasty, and the scallion cream added a nice fresh touch. The pierogis themselves were plump and had a great doughy chew. I know that it's not traditional, but the smoked mozzarella filling was super tasty. The rest of their menu looked awesome, too, but we were alas on our way out from dinner."}
{"text":"Tried shrimp & braised beef taco- very disappointed. Beef was super dry, shrimp there were 3 baby ones. Also tried $10 lobster roll and was shocked. It was all surimi (fake) lobster. This was at last weeks' Lakewood event. They have a lot if work to do comparing to other CLE food trucks!"}
{"text":"Grabbed the Balkan burger at the Ohio city festival before heading to the car for $10. It contains a patty made of lamb, pork, and beef.    It looked delicious. Mostly comprised of just a huge hoagie type bun. Got to the car and took a bite. Pink on the inside and we waited a while for it to be cooked.  Pretty much over for me at that point. I do know pork has to be cooked well. No flavor, not much texture. The touch sauce is simply some type of yum yum sauce recipe. Nothing special. I'm done with this truck!!"}
{"text":"This truck is usually outside on west 25th on Friday and Saturday nights, and is a must if you want some late night munchies after taking down some Ohio city craft beers. All the tacos are mouth watering good, but the pork belly reigns supreme. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

On the few occasions the truck isn't there, my night just feels so incomplete"}
{"text":"A co-worker and I stopped by Touch Supper Truck for lunch during a recent Walnut Wednesday event downtown.  I ordered the kimchi fries and two tacos - one beef and one pork. My co-worker ordered the Balkan burger. A short while later, our food was ready.

My kimchi fries, although an interesting combination, were very tasty.  I ate every one of them! The kimchi had a good, spicy flavor to it. This dish alone could have been my lunch. The two tacos were also delicious. I really like this food truck and I will be back.

Co-worker gave me a chunk of his burger, which I thought was delicious.  He said he really liked it.

Good stuff."}
{"text":"Breaker one nine, breaker one nine, we got a tasty three ton load of wavy gravy rumbling outside the house that rock built. I can't remember if I've eaten from a food truck period at this point, but this was definitely the first time I've had Touch grub. The pooch and I were taking in some Voinovich Park sunshine and it happened to be a big day downtown. Noon Tribe game, Goodtime III revelers steaming off to some certain doom, weirdoes walking around the court building(that actually happens 24/7). We were going to get a street dog, but waiting till we got to the harbor and seeing three food trucks idling there was a great move. We ordered the Kobe dog. GIGANTIC beef sausage smothered in chili and cheese. The dog was in disbelief that you can just give a random vehicle a card and they'll give you meat! That's right. They take the card. Do all trucks? I wouldn't know. I don't get out much. It was the perfect noon time treat for two weary travelers. And Voinovich Park totally sucks. What's the big deal."}
