{"text":"Visited Bottega for the first time on a recent Friday night. Four were in our party and three ordered unadvertised specials not listed on the menu. One of those orders was for their Cioppino. The person ordering it is somewhat of a Cioppino snob as he orders it every chance he gets. He was disappointed by the lack of adequate seafood compared to other venues. The seafood was served over what looked like linquine noodles with a red sauce very similar to the bolognese sauce. There was no broth in the bowl as is the norm. Having said that, the dish was good but small in size considering the price. Two of the party ordered chicken dishes with white sauce also not on the menu. Neither dish had enough sauce but the server brought out more in separate bowls. The fourth meal was the Tagliatelle Bolognese which was very good but could have used more sauce as well. 

Our biggest complaint was the noise level. It was very difficult to have any sort of conversation without raising our voices. We have scratched other restaurants off our list due to excessive noise levels and may do the same with Bottega."}
{"text":"Love supporting the locals, especially when they do it right. Nick and his family make you feel very warm and welcoming when you arrive and the food is outstanding. Definitely a go to place on date night"}
{"text":"Amazing pastas,  great service,  owner has checked in on us to chat the 2 times we went and he was very friendly.  The nutella dessert is TO DIE FOR. Good wine and beer selection too. Finally found a good Italian restaurant on this side of town"}
{"text":"Great menu and very well priced. Authentic taste, great  casual ambiance, yet not too loud. Excellent service and and caring. The owner came by and asked how is the food and if there is anything to make the experience better. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Bottega is great!  The gluten free pizza is SOOO good and tastes like real pizza.  If you are familiar with Cibo near downtown Phoenix, Bottega is just as good, maybe better!  Yeah!  As long as the food and service stay at this level, this will become a regular spot.  Finally a gluten free pizza place in the NW valley without having to drive downtown!"}
{"text":"Thankfully Bottega moved into this location that has seen a few other restaurants come and go. 
I visited for dinner and while the prices are not cheap the quality and service made the value right. Margarita pizza was outstanding and the pastas were extremely good. Highly recommend the white Gnocchi and the strozzapreti left me wishing I could lick the plate in public. Could not be happier with the visit.  I hope this restaurant lasts."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since it was POMO and the food and service were outstanding. I'm not sure what the issue is but my food has been cold the past 3 visits here. Servers are inattentive and don't even offer water or refills. Not to mention I watched my server bring drinks to other tables while not remembering my cocktail until after bringing our plates. I watched him stand around on his phone not even bothering to ask us how the food was.

3 tries, we're not going back. I'm sure the food would have been great hot."}
{"text":"My friend was in town for the weekend and we were in search of a place where we could get Sunday brunch and cocktails.  After an extensive search (through yelp) we found this place. It was PERFECT for what we were looking for. The authentic Italian menu was a treat. The setting and outdoor patio was amazing and the staff was wonderful. They even had live music on the patio. :)  The owner introduced himself and we told him we would be back, and have been back since.  This is my new favorite local place to hang out and enjoy some drinks and great food.  Will be back again very soon."}
{"text":"We have been to this location two times once before it had a name change. Both times the service was prompt and our orders were correct. This is true Neapolitan pizza. Nice and thin but chewy. Fired in a real Neapolitan oven. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The atmosphere was great. The service was great. A very great place to have something other than the traditional pepperoni pizza.
You won't regret coming here"}
{"text":"We have dined at Bottega once and gotten takeout once. Both times the food and service were outstanding. Everybody who works there is frendly and attentive. We will definitely be regulars. One tip: parking can be an issue due to the design of the bulding and the presence of Zipps sports bar in the same area. If necessary, you can park behind Bottega and enter through the takeout door."}
{"text":"Ok, it's not fair that this restaurant is so far from me!  I went back here a few weeks ago on my way to a concert in Glendale, and this time I enjoyed the tagliatelle bolognese, and it was SO GOOD!  Honestly, the pasta was just perfect.  So much so that I have thought about it countless times since I was here last!  Needless to say, every time I go to Glendale, this is the restaurant I will keep going to!

{"text":"The management team of this restaurant is very focused on providing their customers with a great experience. The rest of the staff follows suit. My daughter and I stopped in to place a take out order near closing and we were treated as though time wasn't an issue at all. GREAT service! The food was excellent as well! :)"}
{"text":"This was our 1st time here and we absolutely loved it! Great food, friendly and attentive staff! Nick the owner came over several times just to check in on us, will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Very authentic Italian cuisine! Put it on your list! Great service.. great food! And music on Friday night! Check it out you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place in Arrowhead.  The pizza is fantastic. Try the salami, it is the best I have ever had.  The lasagna is terrific, and according to my friend who took cooking classes in Italy, it is exactly like the lasagna they made in his class.
The happy hour is a great value for smaller bites. Be sure to hurry in to sample the summer menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service and atmosphere. Not exactly kid friendly, but overall a great place! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"When I visit the area, I go to this place. The staff and owner are friendly and attentive. The owner, Nick, checks on every table. My family was celebrating my birthday. Nick treated us to lemon shots and cannoli. Every thing was excellent."}
{"text":"We stopped in after reading other Yelp reviews and glad we did! After a long day traveling and not familiar with the area we stopped in around 8:30pm. Took a seat on the patio, heater made it so enjoyable. Greeted warmly by hostess and waiters alike. The pizza was fantastic! Super thin crispy crust. I ordered the one with pesto and shrimp. Great combo! Husband ordered gnocchi and could tell they were fresh, homemade. All of the sauces and I believe most if not all pasta is made in house. Pizza dough is made fresh daily too! If we lived here, this would be in our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and the pizza was awesome, the cannoli's of were excellent, and the service was amazing!  We will definitely be back!!

Made it back for our second visit and once again everything was excellent, the pizza does not disappoint and the service from Mihai was great for the second time in a row!!  This is gonna be a new regular stop!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food with some of the best service out there! Fanatic spot for a date night. Will definitely take a return trip"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great pizza, wine and atmosphere.  If you are a fan of brick oven pizza, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Excellent meal tonight!
Pizza was a great table appetizer 
Salad dressing was wonderful 
Owner was very attentive"}
{"text":"Finally, a great gluten-free pizza crust. I was diagnosed as celiac about 45 years ago and have missed a great many things. Pizza has been near the top of the list. I have tried gluten-free Pizza whenever I have had the opportunity and been mostly disappointed.

Bottega makes their gluten=free crust on site and it is the best I have ever had. As well, the toppings cover the entire crust and not just a small circle in the middle.

Also, their wine selection is very good and at a reasonable price.

I go there often and am never disappointed.

Give it a try.

{"text":"I just wanted to say that we had a great Mother's Day dinner at this restaurant.  The server was very friendly and the food was delicious.  I would give more stars but it just seemed like the hostess was having a bad day and it felt like she was taking it out on my sister and I when we simply asked if we could sit in the patio.  I understand that it's Mother's Day and you are having more customers than the usual but you should still be professional and friendly to customers. We suggested that there were some available tables out there that could be pushed together, but not until later, then was she trying to be accommodating. When we asked originally, it was a quick no and she was upset with people calling in for wait times.  Again, probably just having a rough day but that should still not be reflected in your interactions with us."}
{"text":"First time in & very disappointed. Although the service was okay the \"Valentine's Day special\" was not great. $50 per person for some disappointing food. I really regret coming in at all."}
{"text":"Outstanding lunch today! It was the first visit and we will return. The soup/sandwich were flavorful and fresh. Kudos to the Chef for the superb lunch. Service was friendly and welcoming. Loved everything about the visit ....and very reasonable."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Friendly staff. The owner, Nick, was very personable and takes the time to speak with each table. The head chef and my Nonni are both from the same small town in Italy. Both he and Nick spoke with her in Italian. She was in her element. It meant so much to her. She's 89 years old and to see her light up the way she did is so rare these days. Wonderful place. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch got a pizza and mozzarella sticks. Loved the pizza had great crust and sauce and that usually kills most places as they cant do both well . The mozzarella sticks were just ok but atmosphere and cleanliness pushed it over the top 5*"}
{"text":"Great food, impeccable service and amazing atmosphere.
The Di Lello's have definitely master the art of true Italian cuisine.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"New ownership brought a great new vibe to this place.  Music a great happy hour and of course amazing pizza"}
{"text":"Great local spot. They went above and Beyond to take care of us on our date night.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Really good food and service.  The gf had a gluten free pizza which she raved about and said it might be her favorite one yet.  I tried a slice and even thought it was good despite hating gluten free items.  I had a regular pizza that was equally as good.  It was a little light on traffic during a week night.  Hopefully they are able to sustain!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but they just didnt deliver. I am willing to them give another chance though and will update my review. We ate here the other day with a party of 6. Below is the good and bad of our experience.

The good: The pizzas were delicious. We ordered a total of 3 pizzas and they all came out very tasty. Crust was awesome! The atmosphere is very nice and welcoming. The greeter as well as our server were very friendly. The meatball starter was pretty tasty.

The bad:  We ordered a salmon bruschetta and it had the smallest amount of salmon we have ever seen on a dish. Literally about 2-3 pieces the size of a fingernail on each bruschetta. It was also burnt and had very little marscapone spread on it. The fig and brie bruschetta was also disappointing with very little fig jam and browned slices of pear. The tuna that we added to the kale salad literally looked and tasted like canned tuna, pretty sure it was. We saw an advertising tent on our table for happy hour but were informed that we had to sit at the bar or patio for happy hour. So we walked up to the bar to order some drinks and the bartender was rude and acted like we were disrupting her by placing an order. The prices are pretty high too for what you get as compared to other similar places by a few bucks.

Overall the place will either correct their downfalls and do some great things, or they will continue the course and close. I hope they read the reviews and work on them because I would love a place like this nearby."}
{"text":"Really delicious and family owned! Really like the gluten free pizza. Best I've had anywhere. Very clean and great wait staff!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars and I've never eaten  there.  I love the fact that the owner takes   the time to respond to any negative reviews and fix it. That being said you can never make everyone happy, but he tries to make up for it and he's accountable that's all you can ask for sometimes when things go wrong. See you Valentine's day Nick ..hope the food is great."}
{"text":"Service was horribly slow. Food was mostly bad. The eggplant parm app was very good but the pizza's were wayyyy too soggy and the squash ravioli was oddly covered in onions."}
{"text":"Went here with a coupon for pizza and a bottle of house wine for $20.  We ordered the speck & brie pizza which was delicious (my husband didn't care for it though, he prefers \"real\" pizza.. pepperoni, ham, you get the idea!) The sauce on it was very good.

 Both of us however enjoyed the red house wine and they recorked it so we could take the rest home. 

We were there at around 11:30 am so it wasn't very busy but it seemed the service was a bit slow, but we weren't in a hurry so it was ok.  

When we walked in we were greeted with a cheery hello from the staff and the restaurant itself has a nice, relaxing atmosphere. 

Perhaps next time we would order something other than pizza"}
{"text":"This is the new name for our favorite pizza place,Pomo in Glendale.  New owner, and an epanded menu but the same head chef and the same amazing Neopolitan style pizzas . Don't be scared off by the changes, enjoy the result."}
{"text":"We were thrilled to find this wonderful restaurant. It was so great that we went there twice in one week. Everything is delicious! The staff treats you like long time friends. The environment is warm, relaxed and welcoming. Yet the food gets to the table super fast. Incredible place with dog friendly patio where you can relax and enjoy the games on the TVs. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Delizioso! Authentic Italian neighborhood restaurant, great atmosphere, wonderful service! Small menu packed with lots of options. Bottega has both an inside and outside bar, plenty of inside seating and outside café style seating. 

To start, we shared the carpaccio, which was piled high with arugula and parmigiana, dressed with a flavored mayonnaise. Very delish. Then we had a fig, pear, Brie and walnut bruschetta. Every bite had the flavor of the fig and Brie with a light touch of pear and crunchy walnuts all on a fresh and lightly toasted baguette. 

For our pasta, we had the tortellini with cream sauce and prosciutto. Amazing! The tortellini was fresh, hot and homemade to order. The white cream sauce was light but flavorful, a great combination with the slightly salty prosciutto. Highly recommend!

To top off our meal, we had the crème Brûlée which was the result of an amazing pastry chef. Creamy custard with vanilla bean and a sweet thin and crisp caramel. Rounded out our whole meal. 

Everything was excellent, and our server was wonderful. As we walked out, we were happy to meet the owners ( and their young son, who by the way was adorable) So many things we want to try on the menu, we will be sure to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"What a find. We went to celebrate my FIL's 80th birthday two nights ago. Best spaghetti carbonara I have ever had. My MIL had ravioli, FIL had lasagna, husband had the Speck & Brie red pizza. We shared a wonderful creme brulee and the restaurant presented my FIL with a triple canoli dish for his special day. We were wowed by every dish. Service was friendly & perfect. We will definitely be going back when we are in Arizona again and I think my inlaws have found their new regular Italian place."}
{"text":"Superb from start to finish! Greeted at the door, welcomed in like family and served a fabulous meal. Calamari and Bottega Pizza were a hit for the whole family. Delizioso!"}
{"text":"This review isn't based on the food itself but the unwillingness to allow me to use a Groupon for take out.  I placed an order over the phone and when I came in to pick it up I was told I could not use my Groupon, because it was meant for dine in customers only.  I was hoping they could make an exception but not so much.  Since, the food wasn't ready upon my arrival, then I decided to just sit at the bar and have all of the food brought out to me which included my wife's food since our children were sick.  I ate what I could then boxed up the leftovers in order to use my Groupon.  I understand, as a business, you want to recoup the 15 bucks from the Groupon via beverages, however I spent over the 30 bucks and would of had a drink while I waited for my takeout.  Instead I drank water.  However, I do have to say the bartender was very nice and I think understood I was upset.  I do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The most delicious Italian food anywhere this side of Central.   The staff is  pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu.  They have refreshing signature cocktails as well.   I love their happy hour menu with items ranging in price from 6-8 dollars (which is super affordable for the quality of the food).  It is very clean and the décor is very nice as well.  I come all the time!  Because I LOVE  great food and service!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We ordered pizza here for the first time tonight and It was the best pizza! The sauce is very simple and authentic Italian tasting, the toppings are very fresh and great quality and the Gluten free crust is by far the best I've ever had! it was so hard to tell it was gluten free and obviously homemade. 
I can't wait to go back and try their pasta....they also have Gluten Free pasta options. 
The atmosphere was really nice as well very cute place and they have a little store when you walk in that  sells imported Italian products. 
Definitely our new favorite place"}
{"text":"Hey hey hey my AZ peeps this little place is is a hidden gem out in Glendale AZ. Grab your bestie, your mate and your date and enjoy live entertainment, outdoor bar and great tasting food ! From beginning to end it was a fun filled evening . As always if you go let me know how your experience was . Enjoy"}
{"text":"Unbelievable gluten free pizza! The best gluten-free I have ever had. I am hooked for life. The service was great...the food was GREAT! We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"The food was good but the portion sizes for what you pay for were quite small. Good taste, too expensive for what they give you. The pesto pasta dish was great but the serving was pretty small. 

Also ordered a glass of wine which we watched sit ready to be delivered on the bar for about 10 minutes when it was finally delivered we were done with our meals so we asked them to take it back as it was a little late. 

Overall glad to try a new place but wasn't really impressed with the food to cost ratio, I know it's handmade pasta but there is no meat in some of the dishes and they are rather expensive!"}
{"text":"For my mom's birthday we tried out Bottega Pizzeria Ristorante. My mom had the Strozzapreti Norcina and I had the Trofie Al Pesto. First, the waiter was great. He gave us recommendations, honored the free appetizer from our Yelp check-in and even mentioned that if we weren't happy with our pasta, he would make it right for us. The pasta was great and clearly handmade, each piece unique. My only note was that the owner went around to most other parties, greeting them and asking about their food. However, he never came up to my mom and me to do this. As we walked out and passed him, neither him nor any of his staff thanked us for dining. I wish he would've made an effort to greet everyone or none at all."}
{"text":"The Manager seemed stressed as he squeezed behind the waiter who was helping a table to adjust the thermostat. The couple gave him a look of \"hey buddy don't interrupt our waiter.\" Order food to go and end up with Sardines on your pizza  when all you ask for was a simple cheese pizza. It looks and smells good until you actually eat the food. Order angel hair pasta and you get regular pasta. So basically order one what you want and you get a surprise when you open the box."}
{"text":"Ok..so the saving grace to this place used to be the pizza..not anymore.  We don't understand the hype of this place.  We never liked the pastas..and 8.95 for 2 pieces of bruschetta with a canned fig sauce that tasted like prunes was not enjoyable.   So..the pizza...horribly soggy.   The toppings all slipped right off.  Wouldn't expect my pizza slice to bend in half trying to eat it.  We have been 5 times..and have decided that is 5 times too many.  Owner is nice..service can be very slow.  (Couldn't get water refills after asking twice).  Not going back."}
{"text":"Had dinner there for the first time since it changed from Pomo this past Friday and had a great time. I had the calamari appetizer, I thought the calamari was good, but the sauce was a little bland and watery. I also had the Marinara pizza, if you like anchovies on then I would definitely recommend it, excellent. I'm not sure if they always have live music on Fridays, but I enjoyed the guy they had playing. I knocked off one star because of the calamari and it was just a little warm in the restaurant that evening. I will be back."}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian Pizzeria! Owners Nick and Chris are hands on managers. Excellent servers (Kalyn and Ali) and top quality food! Love this independent restaurant off 59th Ave. Friday night music is also a plus. Super patio too! Monthly wine dinners are fabulous !"}
{"text":"Called in a good order
The hostess was so sweet the bar tenders are awesome 
Loovvveee this place 
Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"It's a unique experience....but in the best way.  So is the food good? Outstanding.  Wine selection? Unique and awesome.  Atmosphere stands out for its location as top drawer.  But what made it unique was that in speaking to the owner recounting an experience where they offered me a free glass of wine as I waited for a to-go order, he expressed how important it was to make people feel at home.  If they keep this up, it's a great place to visit often."}
{"text":"Was a great time a little loud but was the grand reopening. Lots of free items tonight with the reopening celebration free appetizers for a Yelp review and taramisiu for a birthday could see coming here all the time."}
{"text":"If you like Grimaldis, then you will love this place.  The owner and executive chef are from Italy.  They bring a gift with every bite.  Yummy Pizza, bruschetta, salads and the dessert - wow!"}
{"text":"Just found this place on yelp and gave it a try.  My husband and I are from Seattle hereto watch spring training, so we rely on yelp for good recommendations. Well this on hit it out of the ball park!  Great food even better service. Monica was out server, the owner stopped at our table and welcomed us. Had a couple items off the happy hour menu and pizza off the regular menu and adult beverages, less than $60.00, we were more than satisfied.  Great ending to a fabulous day."}
{"text":"This was a very good place. As a born Italian i always have high expectation and this place did not disappoint. The pizza is really authentic and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the owner is warm and welcoming, and the restaurant is clean. We were a little disappointed by the fact that while still enjoying our salads, the main course arrived. As a result, we felt rushed through our dining experience. The pizza was amazing, and the ingredients were super-fresh and delectable. My husband is fussy about his ingredients and was impressed by the organic/free range chicken offering. Overall, we were genuinely impressed and will be back."}
{"text":"For my wife and I's second anniversary we had brunch at Bottega. After reading the reviews, I was very curious about the food, atmosphere and service.

First, we were greeted at the door by a friendly gentleman, and seated immediately. To our surprise, they had live music going out on the patio.

We started with RICOTTA & CREAM CHEESE BLINTZES, it came two to the plate. It was refreshing and a tad sweet, it almost tasted like a dessert.

For our meals I had the STUFFED PORK TENDERLOIN and my wife had the BAKED GNOCCHI SORRENTO. I can't say enough good things about both of these dishes. With the Pork Tenderloin, I had the side of Roasted Potatoes and they were so good I almost forgot about the main course. They were smothered with rosemary and a light oil, I could eat a whole plate of them. The Pork Tenderloin was moist, and the Italian sausage it was stuffed with was well seasoned and super tasty. I sampled my wife's Gnocchi and was surprised by the tomato sauce. It wasn't overly sweet or savory, it seemed perfectly balanced.

The owner Nick was walking around and personally talking to guests. He spoke to us for a few minutes, and welcomed us for our first visit. He returned later with a complimentary LIMONCELLO CHEESECAKE, that was to die for! Such great flavor! Do yourself a solid and save room for dessert next time you go!

The topping on the cake, we were presented with a trio of cannoli for our Anniversary with the words Happy Anniversary written in sweet caramel.

It was a perfect start to our special day. Thank you Bottega!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! For appetizers,  we always go for the calamari and tried the squash soup which did not disappoint. As for the pizza, I love the one that comes with fried eggplant, but honestly any pizza you get will be awesome. Also, I was so impressed by the service... we haven't been back since last time I came to visit from Florida and the owner remembered us. I highly recommend, some of the best pizza I've had"}
{"text":"For the price it was just ok- had a white lasagna and it was so cheesy and no sauce with very little sausage. I was considering even complaining. I would save your money and go somewhere else

Update: 
Returned to Mother's Day dinner, and as I expected it fell short again. My sister got the pesto gnocchi and it was raw in the middle. The calamari was fishy, and chewy. I was promised a gift card for our first visit due to meeting low expectations and never received it in the mail. I have given this place 4 tries, sad to say we won't ever go back"}
{"text":"Bottega is located in the Citadelle plaza directly north of Zipps.  It used to be named Pomo and a lot of the menu is the same.  They offer salads, pasta, and pizzas.  

We recently visited and had a Kale-quinoa salad along with a Bottega pizza.  The service was very good.  We were seated right away and given drinks promptly.  The salad came out first and was at first very plain.  After we mixed it with the dressing at the bottom it was much better.  Very fresh ingredients.

The pizza took a very long time to come out.  We had finished our salad for quite sometime and the place was almost empty other than 3 other couples.  When it finally came out it was also excellent.  The ingredients were top notch, the dough was chewy yet crispy.  The sauce vs crust vs topping ratio was perfect.  Just a real excellent pizza.

The price was good for the food.  However, a drink happy hour would have been nice.  The bellini was small and not worth 8 bucks to me.  

This place is serving up some very delicious, fresh, homemade food at an affordable price.  Everyone who keeps knocking the area for the small selection of non-chains needs to come here and support them.  

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here and I loved my experience!! Tyler was our waitor and he was very nice, helpful and knew the menu well. And Sam L. was our hostess she was also very friendly and was quick to have us seated. The inside of the restaurant was very nice!! The only recommendation I have is to PLEASE ADD RANCH. I understand that this place is a more authentic Italian restaurant but I feel that I couldn't thoroughly enjoy my pizza without it."}
{"text":"So happy we found this place, everything was delicious. The restaurant is good in size, it is not super big but i do like that it didn't feel as crowded as i thought it would with tables being close together. The staff is amazing and our waitress was on top of making sure our drinks were filled and food coming out hot. The White Lasagna was my favorite dish. The pizza was also very good, they have a great drink selection and of course Coke products.
We will be back and try some other items on the menu and maybe leave room for dessert. I believe the owner was there and he came and said hello and on our way out he made sure we enjoyed our time there. You can tell he is open to feedback and truly cares and values his customers. We will be back and so excited we found this place."}
{"text":"I was told by my neighbors In Arrowhead  that the food here was great but service was awful
They hit the nail on the head . We're new to the neighborhood and were told to get the food to go but decided to try it out anyway , our mistake. The place is so understaffed so you'd best make a night of it.  Nice wine list and menu but service is SLOW and our food was not even Luke warm but it would have taken forever to get new food so we just ate our food and left. We won't be back .."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Happy Hour specials very good! $6 Mini pizza which was spot on, excellent dough, cheese and sauce. Had pasta dish with Pancetta in a red sauce with homemade pasta, again very good.
To top it off, homemade Tiramisu! Nick the owner walks around and greets you which is a nice touch.
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. Generous portions and the squash soup was yummy. Patio was comfortable and the service was very good."}
{"text":"They bought out POMO Pizza up here and it is even better now. Great patio, bar, and a private event space too!"}
{"text":"Just finished our wonderful lunch at Bottega. The pesto was fresh creamy & well prepared. Having just returned from Italy this is the closest we have come to true Italian food ambiance & service
Strongly recommended if you want the REAL experience !"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant in Glendale. Love dining there and the food is delicious.   They treat you like family."}
{"text":"Little hidden gem. Authentic Italian feel. Food is wonderful.. absolute excellent customer service."}
{"text":"After getting turned away from the Melting Pot because all we wanted was some appetizers & a couple of drinks for happy hour and they had some V-day promo going on well past the date ....an EMPTY bar at 4:30pm mind you, we walked across the way and found this little gem. Delicious food, fantastic service and amazing drinks at amazing prices. I will never forget this experience, meeting the owners, what a beautiful atmosphere. We will be back many times! Chef Jill"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner the first time tonight and were pleasantly surprised. The pizza was very tasty and the dessert platter was a great finish. On top of that half price bottles of wine on Tuesdays Whata steal. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited here for the first time last night. We absolutely LOVED our dinner. Kris was super helpful in getting us seated at the bar and moving us to a table once it became available. Our waitress Tiara was friendly and helpful in providing recommendations for the menu. I had the Chianti Classico red wine and we shared the Caprese and Speck & Brie pizza. Both were fabulous and we will surely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is super authentic. There are so many great dishes it's hard to choose. Simple ingredients, but they're PACKED with flavor. They're first generation Italian owners and it shows. Super hospitable, and totally worth every penny"}
{"text":"So where to start....I let our waitress know beforehand that I had a coupon on my phone for a free appetizer, and she wanted to take my phone off somewhere with her so I said no never mind, I just don't trust that. She eventually came back to say I COULD use the coupon, but listed some \"rules\" to what I could use it on that weren't listed on the coupon itself. Apparently there's a price limit and you are charged the difference if you order more expensive appetizers! When taking our orders, she leaned in very close and had the most rancid breath!

When we got our food, I noticed my portion size was that of a children's plate (picture is BEFORE I started eating - pushed all to the side to show how little there was). The pasta was also VERY hard and chewy, if they were going for 'al dente', it isn't listed on the menu so I wasn't prepared. It was very gross, couldn't even finish it.

Overall the food is overly priced (cheapest meal is at least $16) and the portion size doesn't make up for it. The reviews and pictures on Yelp made me want to visit, but it definitely wasn't worth it. I wouldn't recommend this place. Two stars because although there were a few issues with the waitress, the rest of the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"This is a awesome place to go for a happy hour or dinner. The food is delicious and they have just announced they are having a Sunday brunch. Our waiter is amazing ."}
{"text":"We LOVED it!  Great, very cool atmosphere!  The minestrone soup is a must!  We loved our pizza - Quattro Stagioni - had whole olives on it - really delicious and unique.  Great beer selection as well.  Our server, Amanda, was awesome!  Very attentive and fun!  We will definitely be back!  Loved that the manager checked in with us as well!"}
{"text":"I don't eat Italian much, however had an opportunity to stop in for Easter, and now I'm almost kicking myself for not visiting this fantastic Place sooner! They have a wonderful patio setting that had live music, all of the staff is super attentive, and I even had the pleasure of meeting the owner who was completely dialed in and make sure that we were serviced perfectly! 
Now about the food. I had the London broil which you have to give a try if you're in; it was pretty fantastic with a hint of Rosemary and other spices that made it absolutely delectable. I chose a side of pasta with a white sauce that in my opinion was one of the best white sauces I had ever had. Most white sauces tend to be a little bit runny and lacks in regards to substance, but this one was absolutely perfect, it was very delicious and almost in a way thick,  just like a perfect Italian white sauce should be.  For drinks, I tried the Italian Margarita, which packs a really great punch with a delicious agave tequila over the top that was not overripe but definitely a major part of the drink. It was perfectly Blended alongside the limoncello that they use as part of the margarita. 
Although I didn't take advantage of the brunch menu, they have a great brunch menu that includes the very rare Monte Cristo which I absolutely have to try the next time I'm out there. 
All in all with the owner being so passionate about making sure every customer was taken care of, food that was just absolutely perfect, and drinks that were made extremely well and with live music to boot, there is literally nothing that can be said that would be a negative for this great location on the west side! Definitely one of my stops the next time I want to grab a gourmet meal!"}
{"text":"Their lasagna is really great and their pizzas are top notch.  Was in on a Friday and they a guy playing guitar and singing which was cool."}
{"text":"When I heard that the new Pizzeria that took over Pomo had Happy Hour all day on Sundays... That is all it took for me to get my butt over and try it out. 

I ended up selecting a few goodies from the Happy Hour Menu. A Personal Pizza with Salami, Calamari, and the house red wine. The Pizza was the perfect size, I ate all but one piece. Crunchy on the bottom, a good amount of gooey mozzarella and salami on top. The Calamari I believe was a 1/2 serving. It was your typical Calamari, I did enjoy the added arugula for flavor. The house red wine was very good for a $4 dollar glass of wine. I can definitely see myself coming back and enjoying some more of their happy hour menu and sitting on their beautiful patio (Patio is dog friendly by the way. Big plus for this girl!) I can also see myself coming back for a date night in their romantic dinning room setting. 

I have to admit that I was pretty bummed out when I found out Pomo had closed there doors. But when I found out that we were going to get a locally owned restaurant, I turned my frown upside down! Bottega has the same quality pizza, drinks, décor, and service. They have added a few things to the menu, lowered the prices a smidge, added more happy hour, and entertainment. You can catch live music every Friday night, Wine and Painting parities, other special events, such as Mother's Day dinner deals coming up this week, and they even added a Private Dinning area for things like birthday parties and business meetings.

I really hope that this place stays. We need a nice Pizzeria on this side of town."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza place!!! So much flavor!  The mini meatballs are great too!  This is our second time here and today we got to meet the owner of this great establishment, such a nice guy!  Our server was awesome and so polite.  We will be back for the house made pasta next time!"}
{"text":"I don't like to review a place until I have visited a number of times. Every single time I have been here the service and food are amazing. Nick the owner, remembers me every time I visit. Allie the bartender is attentive and my glass was never empty. The pizza was authentic and fresh. I have found a new weekly date night location! I recommend coming here with a HUGE 5 STAR"}
{"text":"We were greeted warmly by the hostess and met up with our party, we made reservations on a Sat night and it was busy! We were seated right when we got there. Our waiter knew the dishes really well and didn't balk at me when I asked what \"trofie\" past was..never heard of it! We ordered a few things, I did end up liking the trofie Al Pesto. The pasta is a little dense and rich in flavor. We would totally come back!"}
{"text":"I first ate here a few days ago and I had no idea what to expect but am always up for something new. Today I came back with my friends for lunch. The pizza is fantastic, I have only had the Amalfi but the cheese, meat, and crust are high quality. 

I sound like an idiot when I try to pronounce the menu items, but the waitstaff is kind enough to let me try. I highly recommend Bottega for a relaxed dinner. You can even eat outside! If you are looking to grab a quick lunch, they had our two pastas and pizza ready and served within 6-7 minutes. I am fairly certain that the spaghetti on the Strozzapreti Norcina were hand made."}
{"text":"Went to dinner and drinks with my wife, she went to the rest room and on her way back I watched a dirty old guy look her up and like she was a side dish. I told the bar tender, with the reply oh he is the owner I don't think he ment it. Later he came by and said great to see you again. I explained to him what I watched, and instead of having an adult convention with me, he grabbed my tab and told me to get out. I told him I didn't want free food and wanted to make sure the bar tender was tipped out as it was a larger bill, with his reply he was going to call the cops. I only want to make sure the bar tender is paid for her great service, please reach out and I would love to meet you with cash for the loss of a hard earned tip!!!"}
{"text":"We came here this evening with high hopes and we came away expecting more. 

We've been fans of the original Pomo's since moving to the Valley over nine years ago.  The original was very intimate and a casual place to sit back and enjoy an evening meal. 

The two replacements (downtown Phoenix & Scottsdale, and now Gilbert) were nice, but very commercialized and noisy.  Did I mention they were noisy. 

Well, Bottega Pizzeria Ristorante has replaced this Pomo's location. According to AZ Republic, \"Italian-born business partners Nick DiLello and executive chef Giancarlo Stefanutto purchased the Glendale location of Pomo from their friend, Stefano Fabbri, on Feb. 1.\"

 So with that backdrop we made a trip over to 59th Avenue and the 101 Loop to see this \"new\" Neapolitan pizza place, with some expectations of a great meal. 

Sadly, expectations don't alway meet reality. And, like their other Restaurants, this place is noisy. Did I mention crowded too?  Thankfully we had reservations and our wait was brief. 

As the Republic article mentions, \"the Bottega menu resembles a Pomo menu with a few name changes and tweaks here and there. Neapolitan pizzas include the Regina Margherita ($15.95) with imported buffalo milk mozzarella. Also look for house-made pastas, a lengthy list of antipasti and Italian desserts made from scratch also are served.\"

The three of us each ordered different menu items, so we got a good feel of Bottega strengths and weaknesses. 

First their strengths. I absolutely loved the Carpaccio.  It was $13.95 and was topped with arugula and shaved Parmesan (see photo). Also good, was the Tagliatelle Bolognese for $15.95. The pasta was wonderful and tasted homemade, but it did lacked that classic beefy, bolognese taste. 

On the negative side was their pizza. It was very watery and the toppings slid off as you picked it up. The tomato sauce was also tasteless, with no strong distinguishing flavor. Sorry. 

The other downer was the Calzone. On the plus side it was huge (see photo), but the so called imported Italian ham was non-existent and overall a puffy, doughy miss. 

We did like our wine choices of Merlot and Sangiovesse and thought they were fairly priced. Our meal for three came to a pricey $98, less a Yelp coupon of $9.95; or $86.29 including taxes but not gratuities. 

We would probably come back for Happy Hour, and eat something light in the bar area. So, Three Stars \"A-Okay\"."}
{"text":"The best most authentic Italian restaurant in Phoenix. The price is reasonable, the food is great.. come here and have a good time, leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and think it's a new favorite. The first time in was couple Saturday's ago and three of us split the Mista salad and 2 pizzas. Quattro Formaggi, a white pizza with just the right amount of cheese, the Gorgonzola gives it a nice kick. Speck and Brie, a red pizza that was suggested by our wonderful waiter, interesting blend of Brie with prosciutto, YummO. We topped it off with a couple beers and a bottle of wine and ended the dinner with shots of limoncello. The second stop in was a late Sunday afternoon by myself, happy hour all day Sunday. At the suggestion of the owner Nick I started with a drink special, a Chambord margarita, good and refreshing after a busy afternoon. I ordered the mini pizza and mini cheese plate off the happy hour menu. Pizza was good and tasty, salame and such a fresh basil taste. I definitely took home leftovers. I finished up with a glass of Prosecco and limoncello cheesecake which was wonderful and light. The owner Nick is always so welcoming and makes it a point to check in on guests. You've gotta go!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. Excellent reviews on Yelp but we were both disappointed.

We attended a retirement seminar and the meal was included. You would think that the restaurant would use this as an opportunity to capture new repeat business. That is not how things went.

There were four of us at the table. All of agreed that the bread was utterly tasteless. 

Vivien always orders a side of ice with her drink. It took multiple requests to get the ice each of the two times desired.

I had the riggatoni and sausage. Oddly some  of the pasta was refrigerator cold. 

Vivien had a chicken and ham with pasta dish. It was only ok.

They missed their mark with us so we won't be back."}
{"text":"Italy meets Glendale in this casual restaurant, everything from the little market upon entering, the waiter from Italy, and most importantly the food!!! 

Let's start with the service. Absolutely wonderful!!!!! From our entrance, which was warm and friendly until the moment we left. Our server was fabulous!!! He was passionate, attentive, and extremely knowledgeable of the menu ( it helped he was Italian). 

For appetizers we ordered the bruschetta and eggplant. The eggplant was so delicious it literally melted in your mouth. Full of flavor and absolutely one of the most flavorful and delicious eggplant dishes ever! The bruschetta, was fresh and very average...not my fave. 

For dinner our table placed a order of STROZZAPRETI NORCINA it has mushrooms , sausage, cognac cream sauce. My sister had this dish and usually never finishes anything...not this... she finished it all!!! 
Our friend ordered the SPAGHETTI CARBONARA and again absolutely fantastic!!!! Last but not least the pizza, we ordered the MICHELANGELO, which comes with tomato sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto, arugula, shaved parmigiano, evoo. We replaced the prosciutto with red bell peppers and it was delicious! The crust on the pizza was fluffy and had a slightly light texture and sweetness from the natural dough making process. I think next time I would ask for it a tad crispier, since the ingredients made the center a bit soggy. Yet it was so delicious you couldn't stop eating!!!

Desserts!!!! Oh boy.... we got the sampler that had a 
CANNOLI SICILIANI
PANNA COTTA, TIRAMISU, and  TORTA NUTELLA. So much deliciousness!!!! In addition we ordered the CREME BRULEE and a full order of TIRAMISU! The portion size is so large you could share between two or...not. 

Everything we had was so delicious and the service exceptional!!!! I highly recommend and will be returning on every visit to Phoenix!!! Buon appetito"}
{"text":"Really traditional Italian food, pizza and pasta. Very quaint environment, fresh pasta cooked same day, lots of different menu options. Pasta was just a bit too al dente  for my taste but sauces were amazing! Try the strozzapretti norcini! And the tiramisu is to die for!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Fig Brie for appetizer, I ordered the Bottega pizza, and my wife ordered the Fusilli Salsiccia. All three were super AMAZING!! This place deserves a lot of credit. Our food was made very quickly, and our waiter checked on us at least 5 times during our visit. Beautiful atmosphere as we sat outside listening to the birds, and the authentic Italian music. We love this place!"}
{"text":"The pizza at this location is a traditional Neapolitan style. I visited this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. The bar area was rarely crowded, however the dining area was quiet. The pizza was flavorful, however I was hopeful for more choices in toppings. Their drink specials were fairly priced and their mimosas were great. Would recommend for a more authentic Italian pizza experience."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to eat here for sometime finally got to. I loved it manger greeted me as I walked In . The waitress we had was awesome. The food was amazing. The guy playing music was great! I loved the layout of the restaurant. I can't wait to go back. I want to try the brunch next time. Overall great place! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Such a friendly spot for pizza.  Food is excellent  -- even the non-pizza.  Good wine list.   We also enjoy the wine pairing dinners."}
{"text":"This place is so AUTHENTIC!!!!!

The food is amazing, the atmosphere is awesome, and the service is attentive and nice. I went here with my family last week and we were all so satisfied. 

What's really great is that they have a bunch of vegan and gluten-free options, which can be really hard to find at a pizza place. So that's wonderful. They also have a great selection of appetizers and entrees. I had these zucchini things that were the most delicious thing I've ever tasted in my life. The pizzas I tried (yes, even the GF and Vegan ones) were soooo yummy. 

My favorite part about this place is that they serve Aperol spritzes!! That was my FAVORITE drink when I was in Europe and literally no one has them here so I was elated to find a place that serves them. 

And let's not forget about dessert. Definitely save room for dessert. I don't care if you're counting calories or what, because you need to try it. They also have an amazing selection of after-dinner drinks so check those out as well.

Overall, 10/10, go here."}
{"text":"First time here. Came with a few friends for happy hour. Ordered a Irish Mule (not on the menu) and it did not disappoint. Shared the mini cheese and meat plate...it was more than enough to share. 

Service was friendly and attentive. Nice atmosphere and live music was a bonus. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Started with the Carpaccio appetizer that was awesome! Definitely recommend the fusilli salsiccia dish, it was excellent! Also had the desert sampler platter... insanely delicious. Great atmosphere little busy during weekends but worth the wait. Will be back"}
{"text":"Came in tonight for a date night with my husband and had a wonderful dinner. The food was delicious and the service was spot on. Nick, the owner came by and said hi. Dessert was a compliment to dinner. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Having been to Italy a couple of times I can say this tastes just like Italy. This is now our go to place not just for Italian food but to hang out as well. We love the food (pizza, pasta, appetizers, dessert) and wine. They use fresh ingredients and import some ingredients from Italy. Their chef worked tirelessly to create a superb gluten free crust that taste just like regular crust. Same goes for their pasta. We love the atmosphere and Live Music Friday. We love that Nick genially cares about his customers, stopping by to make sure your experience is great. He equally cares about his employees. We love an Owner that takes care of his staff. You want to come taste this most delicious authentic Italian food and wine."}
{"text":"Not very happy with our experience or food!  I went with my mother around 2:30pm on a Thursday. There were 3 people in the restaurant.  Our first server was a bit of a bust. He was in a rush and it turned out he wanted to take a break because he was on a double. He told us this. He really didn't know the menu it seemed.  My mom informed him she had a garlic allergy and he replied, \"and you came to eat in an Italian restaurant.\"  So, I had to send him to ask the chef if the lunch sandwiches had garlic in them.  He left for his break and we were ignored while he worked on his tickets. 

On to the second server. I don't think he even knew we were there because I had to flag him down.  He was a good server, even though he was flustered by the confusion.  We didn't even have silverware or napkins. 

Now the sandwiches.  My mom liked hers very much. I ordered the vegetarian. It came to me with grilled onions, even though onions were not listed under the description. It was supposed to have roma tomatoes and I didn't get them on the sandwich. I had to send the sandwich back because I didn't want the onions, but I did want the tomatoes. The server made the owner come over and talk to me about the sandwich. It was unnecessary really. The owner looked confused or maybe he didn't really care. 

The second sandwich comes out. There are hardly any grilled vegetables on it and it has two slices of beefstake tomatoes. Where are the roma tomatoes?  And I was hoping they would be grilled as well.  They weren't. Huge let down!  I like the sweeter flavor of the romas. I inform the server again, but he just says he will have to tell the owner.  

The minestrone soup was very good though.  My mother and I each had the soup/sandwich combo. The soup had a nice, refreshing lemon flavor instead of a tomato broth. 

The restaurant was very clean and had a nice decor. The restaurant popped up in my Yelp feed and I wanted to give it a try. Unfortunately, I don't expect I will ever go back."}
{"text":"The pizza tonight took me back to our trip to Italy last year. It was exactly like that pizza with thin crust and delicious sauce and cheese! Then came dessert and it was exceptional! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty Italian food and deserts.

Drink order wait times were long (10mins) due to the fact that they had only one bartender.
I had an \"Old Fashioned\" and was very tasty.

The Siciliani Canoli's we're outstanding ! 
 
I will go back to this place."}
{"text":"The wife and i went there for the first time since it opened.  We wanted to try something close to home.
The first thing we  noticed was the entertainment, a guy playing his guitar.  which was not a bad thing except i am really hard of hearing  on one side so it was really annoying for me to carry on a conversation.  but it was the mood so i get it. not complaining really,  if it was not so extremely hot ,we would of just sat out side.
The first thing we ordered was the mushroom appetizer with the palenta and i have to say honestly it was so bland i could of opened and cooked the box that the pasta  came in and i could of got more flavor out of the box.  
I ordered the spaghetti  and the wife ordered  Tortellini pascudo.  
After the appetizer malfunction   we were excited for dinner. When the food came i was a little under whelmed on the portion size compared to what i have received at other Italian restaurants, I also thought a bit of bread would have been a nice addition to the meal. Everything is al la cart. My spaghetti was ok.  I just wanted  basic red sauce tomato and meatballs.  and i was not loving the flavor. I am not a picky eater at all. I will eat or try pretty much anything.  however if i do not like something it has to be (different)  The wife liked her meal and had no complaints , however  she went back to my complaint about the bread or lack of with this meal. just thought it would be a nice addition
I probably would not return   but it is a nice trendy  little place  in a nice area of town"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  The whole staff was on point. Friendly and knew the menu. The food was some of the best I have had. Fresh ingredients and perfectly portioned."}
{"text":"Bottega Pizzeria Ristorante is located in Citadelle Plaza in Glendale where Pomo was and also the same spot where Tutti Santi was. If you were a fan of Pomo then you will absolutely be a fan of Bottega because it truly is the same. The pizza is certified and the dough is made by Pomo. Currently the hand made pastas are also made by Pomo but they will make the pasta in house when they get the equipment they need.

This restaurant serves a variety of appetizers, salads, hand made pastas, and certified neapolitan pizzas. They have wait service, bar and indoor and covered outdoor seating in a modern environment.

We shared a pasta and a pizza.

I was sort of blown away by the Trofie al Pesto pasta. It was so to the tooth it was amazing. It was like something you'd get at a fine restaurant in New York, Las Vegas or Italy. It wasn't like anything anywhere in Glendale (that I know of). It was a bit generous with the sauce and I didn't need it but a piece of bread to mop it up would have been great!

The pizza was like my first Pomo Pizza...more on the wet side than some of the other Pomo Pizzas I tried. But for sure was a high quality pizza.

Service was good. Atmosphere is good!

Great Potential here.....I'm looking forward to the Black Board Specials that they will offer once  they settle in.

4.5 stars with strong potential"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Definitely the best new Italian place in town.  The Speck and Brie Cheese Pizza is blow your mind unreal.  They make a lot of their pasta fresh and the desserts are to die for"}
{"text":"Really good non-traditional pizza.  Music on Friday nights but it was hard to hear the performer.  The restaurant overall was very noisy.  Probably a good place in cooler weather so you can sit outside."}
{"text":"The hubby and I always like to try new places on date night. This place beautiful inside out! Such a romantic atmosphere,  the customer service was impeccable too!!  We enjoyed a free appetizer the meatballs, they were soo tender and yummy! Then the mista salad, we shared it, it was just right! The main course was the Bottega pizza and we loved it!! Our waitress was so sweet and very knowledgeable about the restaurant.  Then the manager came by gave us his card, asked us how we liked it. We finished our meal with tiramisu, DELICIOUS!! Just when I thought we were done, we were served a shot of limonciello- They truly impressed us!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Not busy at all for lunch. There is not another spot like this in the north valley that serves this style of pizza. I would imagine this is a lively spot on the weekends with all the surrounding neighborhoods. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for happy hour last night. We got the meatballs for an appetizer which were not special at all and we got the Bottega pizza. The pizza was very watery and soggy such a let down since Pomo was really good."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh it tastes like they have a garden in the kitchen to pick from. I enjoyed the margherita  pizza and the basil had a delicious crunch. The crust had those wonderful bubbles and was toasted to perfection. It's obvious they take care in providing fresh, authentic Italian cuisine. I can't wait to come back and see what else I love on the menu!"}
{"text":"We love Bottega! My husband and I both love going there...we have come to know the owner Nick and his wife, and they are hard working and very cordial all the time.
I love the tortellini with prosciutto, and the gnocchi dish is fantastic! Great wine list too Fo yourself a favor and go!!"}
{"text":"We have been on a few times and this place never disappoints. The focaccia appetizer is my favorite and the carbonara is a great entree. If we ever have any issue at all, the owner Nick is very quick to make sure we are taken care of. It's hard to find a locally owned restaurant in the area with great service, but this place is it! You will feel like family even if it's your first time in. Thanks Nick for making us feel like family!"}
{"text":"This is the old Pomo in Glendale - their food is AMAZING!!!!!! The new owners are wonderful and are often floating around checking on all of their guests. They have a great selection of true Italian entrees, some really great signature cocktails, and an amazing dessert menu!!! I will probably butcher this, but I highly suggest the Avogadro dessert, it is my favorite dessert I have ever had anywhere and I am super picky. We come here as often as we can with our busy schedules, and do not see that changing any time soon. Nice work fellas :)"}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant. Lovely patio. They have live entertainment Friday night and Sunday for brunch. We each had a pasta dish. Absolutely delicious. The owner came by and greeted us. Support your family businesses. Blessings!"}
{"text":"I love this place the food is amazing and the service is great. While a little on the speedy side the flavor makes up for it and I actually appreciate the portions are huge so I feel like I have to eat everything and then feel uncomfortably full."}
{"text":"This place is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. My hubby and I went to Bottega with friends tonight and I was honestly blown away. We have eaten pizza in Italy and let me tell you, their pizza rivals what we've eaten in Rome. The crust is excellent, light...slightly chewy, wood fired. The toppings were fresh and delicious. I also ordered the polenta with gorgonzola mushroom sauce and the sauce was incredible. I dipped my bread in it to soak up every last drop. Also, fabulous cocktails...we enjoyed the Old Italian. We then tried the dessert trio with tiramisu, Nutella torte, and panna cotta with strawberries..... yum! The panna cotta melted in my mouth, truly a perfect consistency. I was also very impressed by the service. Our server was great and very knowledgeable about the menu. The manager even came by to ask about our meal and give us free appetizer cards for our next visit. The happy hour menu is also awesome!! Can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"The owner Nick was checked in on us twice and also checking on everyone's table to see how the food tasted. The waiter was excellent he was on top of everything ! The food was excellent, we've never been to a fancy joint before, but I can honestly say I will definitely be returning. The Valentines menu was a 3 course meal with paired wines. We didn't order it but the other menu options are superb. I will recommend this restaurant to anyone with a pulse. Menu is upscale"}
{"text":"Came here because they had carbonara. Unfortunately they don't know how to make it. Very disappointed. Took the bread away- bring more with dinner please. Appetizers ordered the shrimp and calamari- no shrimp in it at all
Water was good. Wine was good. 2 thumbs down.
Husbands lasagna was small and mediocre
Keep it simple and more authentic 
Should've gone to Babbo's"}
{"text":"Six of us went for my daughters bd, sure won't be back. Bread basket was basic, and I love bread, only tried a bite,it was plain white bread. I ordered lasagna it was so bland and not worth the price. One daughter had pasta with pesto sauce, came in a large bowl, tiny portion but the pasta was practically crunchy so she didn't finish it. The dessert sampler was wonderful, owner was nice passed out business cards for free appetizers, left them on the table. Doubt they will be in business long, honestly Olive Garden has more flavor."}
{"text":"Read on yelp how good it was. Was disappointed helpings extremely small for the price. One pasta dish with no meat at all $16. Really short of noodles.Pasta is cheap so spend another $.25 for more pasta. Dish didn't look at all like picture posted.
Waiter needs to learn menu. Ask what dressings for salad . Italian, balsamic vinegar oil. Salad came with nothing on it. asked another waitress what dressings lemon, Caesar gee strange. Our waiter didn't tell us that. Ordered glass of wine came just as finishing dinner. Thank goodness  it wasn't crowded. Would not recommend if hungry. Taste was good just pricey for what you get. Waiter should have compt the wine instead of taking back. Management needs to train better"}
{"text":"Previously Pomo, the restaurant looks exactly the same but the menu is expanded. I really want to love this place as the food and drinks are quite good but the portion sizes are insanely small for the price. For example, I love the tortellini with prosciutto however it was $17 for literally one cup of pasta. While that's about the amount a person is \"supposed\" to eat, let's be honest, no one goes out to spend a lot of $ on a mere one cup of pasta. My family left hungry after their meals. Hopefully things will change."}
{"text":"I've been to Bottega a couple of times now and can safely that it is a great place to dine. During my first visit, I went in for an early dinner around 5:00 pm. The dining room had a few other patrons, but it was nowhere near crowded. The second time I dropped in for a meal it was closer to 7:00 pm and the restaurant was certainly busy. 

I have tried both the pasta (the trofie al pesto) and the pizza (regina margherita) and can honestly say that both taste super delicious. The pasta was just perfectly al dente and the pesto had a good depth of flavor. The pizza did not disappoint either as it had a great crust and extremely flavorful tomato sauce. 

Service was great during both of my visits and food came out at a good pace, even when the place was busy. I will definitely be dropping by again when an Italian food craving kicks in.

There is a free appetizer deal if you check in on Yelp and Midwestern University students do get a discount (though this varies in terms of how much at times)."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza to go.  And I was a little mad I didn't stay.  The atmosphere was amazing and so was the staff.  My pizza was delicious and I want to go back."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the Bottega Pizza. Very good. Great service at the bar by Elma. Would definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"We enjoy Bottega very much and have taken several friends and family there. Fresh seafood and homemade pastas. LOVE the authentic Italian dishes and specials; and great options for gluten-sensitive or vegan diets. Highly recommend their patio seating. Also, a great indoor/outdoor bar."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Portion sizes seemed small particularly for the price.  The tortellini panna and cannoli were tasty but filled up mostly on the focaccia bread because I was still hungry."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Bottega Pizzeria Ristorant for the first time since they recently open. It will become one of my favorite Pizza Restaurants. There are a lot of good pizza joints on the west side but they seem to put the top notch ones on the east side. Bottega has the wood fired brick oven which I love and my wife requires gluten free food. A lot of restaurants now serve a 10 inch frozen gluten free pizza crust which is no match for the hand made gluten free (any size) pizza crust at Bottega, with that oven baked burnt (my term) crust. Pizza was phenomenal and prices were very reasonable for the excellent quality that we received. Shortly after being seated we were met by Nick the owner who welcomed us. Very nice touch Nick. We are very excited to come back and try some of the other dishes which can be made gluten or vegan free. They have wine, beer, and hard liquor to accommodate your wishes. We will be back and encourage all to try a new venture in Glendale (59th ave just below the Loop 101.)

{"text":"Another great Italian restaurant in the Phoenix area.  Besides this one my favorites are Andreoli, Pomo, Trattoria Veneto and That's Amore Gelato.  My family and I lived in Italy for 10 years and so we always seek genuine Italian cuisine.  This hits the spot.  I had the polenta with a creamy mushroom and sauce and it was delicious.  The fried calamari was just okay but not bad either.  My wife and I loved the pizza.  It's napoletana style and they nail it.  It would remind you of Pomo.  The owner speaks with all the customers and really wants all his customers to appreciate the experience and the restaurant.  He really cares and it shows.  Our waitress was a delight.  We appreciated that the restaurant was very busy and so there was a buzz to the place.  Agree with Florence B, the bread was fresh, soft and delicious.  This is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Had high hopes , ordered the entrees they were decent, had to ask for bread, cheese & red peppers in a shaker like a pizza joint! wasn't fresh  , it was a small portion for 16 bucks .... employees need to stay off cell phones ! Owner was friendly, and will try once more!"}
{"text":"Incredible. This will def be a regular spot for my family. Nick is really welcoming. Their homemade pasta is on point."}

{"text":"Stopped by Bottega with family and left very impressed. From the food to the staff, all were on point on our Friday night visit.  All pasta was homemade and the sauces were great. Each dish stood alone and made sharing them enjoyable. I look forward to a future visit to try something new. A great spot to visit if in the Northwest valley."}
{"text":"This place is great! The pizza is very authentic (not the super thick americanized version), the restaurant itself was fun, modern vibe but classy enough for a date. The service was impressive- at the end of our meal the owner came by to ask how everything was. We chatted with him for a minute and when he heard I was a Midwestern student he took our tab to re-run with the student discount. Nice to see people going out of their way to make our night even better- two thumbs up from us Bottega!!"}
{"text":"Completely awesome.  The lasagna was so good. The service was outstanding.  This is my new favorite place to eat.  I found it on Yelp, so thank you Yelp.  I would give 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise. Very Italian flavors from in house sausage to fresh basil. Definitely will be coming back to try the whole menu."}
{"text":"The important stuff; No too expensive but not cheap either. Kids eat free Saturday and Sunday. Excellent food!! Worth every penny. 

The fun stuff; Park in the back so you can walk through the kitchen. It is spotless and smells terrific! Go on Friday so you can enjoy live music. Just like a fine Italian family ran business, Nick the owner will check to see how your visit is going. Be ready for excellent service with an old time feel.

My family and I ordered a meatball appetizer, delicious. For the main dish my kids had spaghetti and pizza. My wife had a Margherita Pizza and I had a calzone. Both fresh and mouthwatering. Finally do NOT skip desert, order the Nutella Pizza, it's phenomenal. Thank you Nick for bringing a part of the old country to Arizona!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times and each meal has been delicious. We have tried the bolognese - (wonderful) - the kale salad (good), and the house salad (perfect). We had a pizza one night that was also excellent. It's a nice atmosphere and welcoming to all. The owner (maybe manager) always comes around to check on you. The staff are great - especially the hostess this weekend. She was awesome. We sat outside and it was beautiful. I love supporting local businesses and will be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has only been open for four months. The food quality was excellent though a little overpriced. Three bruschetta for about seven dollars seems a little excessive, and Bolognese for $15+ also seemed a bit high. I was also surprised that no Italian bread or garlic bread was served with a dinner.

The kitchen was a little slow. We went on Mother's Day and the restaurant was busy but not overcrowded. Our food came out one or two at a time. We had to wait about two or three minutes maybe more between entrées being served. The desserts came out even slower, one at a time, almost as if there was only one person in the kitchen doing desserts.

This might all sound negative, but it was a very nice restaurant and as I stated, the food was excellent. Overlooking these small little things I would've given the restaurant five stars. For only been open for four months, I see great things for this restaurant and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food - very authentic Italian.  The manager came by to introduce himself, which is always a nice touch.  They also did a good job with the busters of keeping the outside patio bearable during a very hot evening."}
{"text":"This place is great... words don't describe what a great atmosphere it is. Gonna be back oh ya..."}
{"text":"We came here due to a Groupon-type of coupon we had that was getting ready to expire. We were seated right away and the waitress was friendly and took our order for two iced teas. We wanted to try the pizza and was a little disappointed that they didn't offer an appetizer-sized one. Apparently they offer one during happy hour but it had ended 5-10  minutes earlier so we had to pick something else. We opted for the meatballs and they came out in record time. Literally like 2 minutes later! They were not very hot at all and we debated about whether sending them back but decided to go ahead and eat them anyways. They were okay but to be honest, nothing spectacular.  The bread they serve you when you first sit down was good and we used it to mop up the remaining sauce. I ordered the Trofie Pesto and I was very pleased with it. The pasta was cooked perfectly and I loved the dense \"toothiness\" of it. The pesto sauce was flavorful and went well with the pasta. Hubby ordered the Strozzapreti Norcina and come to find they were out of the usual pasta it is usually served with so he opted for the fusilli pasta instead. It turned out to be very disappointing as the pasta just didn't do the sauce justice. We will probably be back but make sure to do it during happy hour."}
{"text":"Love this place!! My parents always come here every weekend which brought me here & the staff is always super welcoming & friendly! They treat you like you're family & go above & beyond to make sure you're having the best experience! Have to try the fuselli pasta :)"}
{"text":"The sauce on the pizza I ate had no real flavor.. The service was slow... my wife had a sandwich that had very little meat and mostly bread at $10 ..overpriced...Very disappointing... Will not return..."}
{"text":"There are a lot of options in N Glendale if you want to enjoy a slice of pizza or a whole pie, but Bottega is my local #1 if I want brick-oven, Neopolitan style pizza. I've dined here a few times since the transition from Pomo to Bottega and the food is top notch and made with very high quality ingredients. The owner- Nick- is normally on site and checking on customers and the kitchen which is what a place like this needs because it's Bottega by name but once you've met Nick you'll feel like it's Nick's place and you're welcome to stop by anytime and make yourself comfortable at a table or at the bar.

Last Sunday night, we had the Botttega pizza, which is red sauce, mozzarella, basil, roasted red peppers, spicy salami and sausage and a bottle of house wine for $20. Tiara was our server, and she was great. She brought us the polenta and mushroom app and the sauce was begging to be sopped up with something so she got us some fresh baked bread from the brick oven.   

One thing I have to point out is that on Mother's Day they offered a set price 3-course meal but also kept the regular menu and the happy hour specials. Plenty of restaurants wouldn't do that and I appreciated that they did keep all options open.

Big patio out front with misters and shades plus a huge private room for events. I haven't tried many of the pasta dishes yet but that'll happen. You should put Bottega into your rotation for pizza, happy hour, or Italian food."}
{"text":"The staff here is great, so nice and flexible. I had a dessert party here and they were great. The desserts were solid, the creme brûlée dominated the day. The apps weren't my favorite, but we only
got a few. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"I had the Fusilli Salsiccia, and it was phenomenal. I highly recommend it to anyone who is unsure what to pick their first time in just wanting pasta. One cool thing, you don't typically see, the owner comes around and introduces himself to first time guests. Love this place. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely blown away by Bottega! Been here 3 times, and each time has been absolutely delightful with flavorful food, a very kind and romantic atmosphere, and a very attentive and professional wait staff. I will continue to come to Bottega and will continue to recommend it to everyone I know! I'll see you soon Bottega for another phenomenal pizza and cannoli :)"}
{"text":"So happy to see someone still understands customer service. The owners went out of their way to make sure we were happy and everything was perfect. We were celebrating my husbands birthday. Everyone was so welcoming and accommodating. The food was absolutely authentic and incredible. This was our first time here and it definitely won't be our last. The live music was awesome too. This place is fantastic. Thank you so much. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrific evening! Great atmosphere, friendly service and outstanding gluten free pizza!"}
{"text":"The food is really great. Home made bread was wonderful, we had pasta and pizza and while the pasta was really good the pizza was fantastic. Only rating it 3 stars as the service was not great. They brought us the wrong food out 3 separate times and we kept telling different waiters/waitresses the food wasn't for our table. We did get our order and it was correct but it was annoying to keep telling someone that wasn't our dish. We had a mix of wait staff and rarely was anyone the same person. They seemed to be in a rush to get us out and a bit disappointed when we ordered desert although I'm not sure why as there were other tables open. We went on a night when there was live music, which was nice but it was so loud we all felt like we were shouting at the table between our group and still couldn't hear what each other were saying. 

Food is pretty solid, front of house needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"We love non restaurant chains in shopping centers. This is a beautiful place and we enjoyed meeting the owner. I had the white lasagna which was a special of the evening. It required a bit more salt but otherwise good. Honey enjoyed a pasta and sausage dish. Nice size meals that left us full. Cute interior and great service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to dine in Glendale. Great staff great food, upscale and professional."}
{"text":"Plenty of choice of white and red wines, and delicious really Italian food!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night, the first time since they changed from Pomo.  First off, the Carpaccio is in a league of it's own.  The lamb chops (a special) were the best we've ever had.  Finally, you can't go wrong with the homemade pastas!"}
{"text":"An excellent Italian restaurant that's right out of Naples. The owner is personal and kind. If you know good Italian food, this is it!"}
{"text":"Thanks so much to Nick and Christine who made a beautiful Celebration of Life party for my Mom become a reality! Everyone was personally taken care of and the food was continually refreshed and delicious! I absolutely recommend Bottega for any private event and for regular dining."}
{"text":"The staff and owner were very friendly and welcoming which will definitely be the reason we go back. The waiter suggested a wonderful red wine and I loved it! The fig and Brie appetizer was very good but not great. The large walnuts fell off and it could've used a salty element. The bread was wonderful but i, personally, would've preferred and oil and vinegar dip over the butter. We ordered the bolognese and the tortellini with prosciutto. Although we were told the bolognese had fresh pasta, it tasted like dried. The sauce was great outside of needing salt. The tortellini tastes good but the prosciutto tasted like average ham and the cream sauce wasn't my favorite. Just bland. That being said, we will definitely give it another try because the staff and owner were so wonderful."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, pizza fresh and fast, pasta delicious, and atmosphere was great. Service was okay except we had to ask for refills on water and tea. Besides that though, I'd recommend it to any of my friends."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but the service wasn't the best. They gave us food but not the utensils"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service.  Wine was a healthy poor and excellent.  Partner had pizza which he loved and I had soup and salad.  Both excellent.  Complimentary bread was also very fresh.

Owner came by when the pizza was delayed and apologized.  He gave us a certificate for a free appetizer next time we come in.  We appreciated his gesture as it was unsolicited by us.

Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant that truly doesn't get the attention it deserves. The staff is incredibly friendly and the manager even checked in on my table to ensure we were enjoying our meal and ambiance. Food was incredible, and so was the wine!!"}
{"text":"Since Bottega first opened, replacing Pomo Pizzeria, I really wasn't sure what to expect. I initially gave them a solid four-stars during my original review, stating that their pizza and a variety of dishes are very similar to what was originally found on the old Pomo menu. 

Since then, I've watched Bottega sort of branch out and do their own thing. Yes, the pizza is still pretty much identical to what you'd find at Pomo, but they've since taken the original menu and made it their own. Multiple pastas, desserts, and even an impressive brunch on Sundays, I'm really happy to see these guys thrive in an area that desperately needs better dining options for the locals.

In terms of food, their pizza is probably the best you can find in West Valley. Yes, people, it's supposed to be wet in the middle! Ingredients are all top notch and crust is full of flavor. My favorite would probably be the Bottega itself, although you really can't go wrong with a traditional margherita. Pastas are all solidly executed, with my girlfriend and I both preferring their fusilli over everything else. I guess we're just \"silly\" like that. 

For desserts, the menu remains very Pomoesque in its options with a few liberties taken. They offer a Nutella calzone, although we always request to have it served as an actual pizza. But if that's too much dough for you, you really can't go wrong with a semifreddo. 

What I'm really happy about is that after multiple visits, I can confidently say that the food here is consistent. Not once has anything came out tasting dramatically different than it has on another occasion. 

I also have to give the nod to Bottega for their excellent customer service. Any issues with order mess-ups will be handled promptly. Unlike another popular Italian restaurant up North in Peoria, service doesn't suffer when the place gets slammed. During a recent Friday night visit, food and service were executed so smoothly, you'd almost have no idea that they were so crowded.

One of the owners stops by and checks on us during every single visit - without fail. In fact, he does this with everyone. Clearly, the man is very customer-oriented, which is something that I wish more places would take note of. We dine here far less frequently than we do other establishments in Phoenix, but yet, they always seem to remember us. It says something.

Bottega is an awesome choice and I'm very glad to see that a legitimately local pizzeria is doing so well in this area. Well done!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We loved the atmosphere and food!! On Sundays then have Live entertainment and TVs for the guys to watch sports."}
{"text":"I only wish I had taken pictures of the food! My favorite pizza place is Cibo and let me tell you, this place is a west side equal!

The ambiance is nice, casual but fancy enough for a date night.

We ordered the watermelon/feta/onion/balsamic salad to start. It was a seasonal menu item, but it deserves to be on the menu all the time. The combination of watermelon and feta is amazing.

We split a gluten free pizza (Michelangelo) that was just delicious! The crust, according to my gluten-eating mom was just as good as regular crust, if not better.

The manager/owner came by and spoke to us for a while, which was really awesome and playing into the family vibe this place has!

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"came here a few months ago and for some reason forgot to write the review.
i remember we liked it,, we ordered meatballs for appetizer and they are very good. We all ordered pizza and my daughter was able to get gluten free pizza. We ordered the quattro formaggi. my wife really liked the pizza and i did also but i would order something different next time with some meat. My daughter liked her gluten free pizza also. Will be back"}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed if you choose to go here for a meal. It's a beautiful space, the service is excellent, the pizza is authentic, the bruschetta is amazing. They even go above and beyond to try to make a fussy kid happy...and he was. I'm so glad this is in my neighborhood.  Please stay!"}
{"text":"If there were 10 stars I'd mark all 10.
Food- AMAZING. And by amazing I mean, I've been to Italy and this is the real deal. The gnocchi is made in house and I've literally never had a pasta that was so fluffy & light, perfectly matched with rich Gorgonzola sauce & mushrooms(next time we'll try to add pesto upon the owner's suggestion!). The Fig & Brie appetizer was a great start pairing of sweet preserves & creamy cheese onto hearty baguette slices. We also tried a custom veggie pizza and whatever they're process is for making the crust, it's divine. Chewy, salted to perfection, with a bright & acidic Napolitano sauce buried beneath layers of real mozzarella and deliciously charred, this was one for the books. Tiramisu is OFF THE CHAIN. Not kidding, this was better than any of the desserts I had in Italy--the ladyfingers weren't overly soaked and mushy, and it was beautifully presented. I could keep going on about their food but, I'll stop long enough to mention the vibe/service. 

Service-our server was awesome and matched our sense of humor with witty interaction and had our order memorized perfectly. Was attentive but not annoying and was great about timing all the food! Then the owner walked around to every table to make sure everything was up to par and I even saw him helping bus tables, which in my opinion really shows there is a lot of love and care put into this place. He wound up comping our dessert and throwing in limoncello for our anniversary and we were totally overwhelmed at such a kind gesture, I wish more restaurants had this level of service! 

Vibe-it can be as casual or fancy as you want! We sat on the patio and their misting system, bar TV and seating completed the more casual vibe of the outside area, while patrons seated indoors looked cozy and comfortable. 

Overall this place is a total gem and we will be making a point to return every time we visit Phoenix, you won't regret making a reservation here!"}
{"text":"First time here for me. We were greeted by the owner, Nick Dilello. Very nicely furnished with a great bar. Inside and outside seating. We had pizza and it was terrific. They use a wood fired oven and it was perfectly baked. 
I highly recommend this place. I will be back."}
{"text":"We had eaten here a few times when it was Pomo.  Decided to pop in the other day to see what Bottega was about...hmm, it is exactly the same as Pomo lol.  That being said, we actually enjoyed the experience more than we did when it was Pomo.  The menu even seems the same...everything we ordered was delicious.  They have a great happy hour.  Honestly this may be our new go-to for authentic Italian pizza.  It helps when the table next to you was 2 gentleman speaking Italian the whole time.  Makes ya feel like it's the real deal!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the vibe. ...wonderful pasta and pizza! Tiramisu was excellent!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! Great service, excellent wine (and we happened to visit on  a night when wines were half off!) and the food was fabulous! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to eat here after we seen all the great reviews and Bottega didn't disappoint! We went on a Saturday night and it was moderately busy (we went about 45 min to closing time). The staff was extremely friendly and our food came out fast. The bruschetta was delicious and it was huge! The pizza was some of the best I've had and my boyfriend got the calzone which he loved as well. Our waiter was great and always made sure we had what we needed. We will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"I had a meal at Bottega last night with friend and her granddaughter, Everything was great except my main dish, eggplant parm that was tasty but chewy  Bottego took it off the bill and gave me a coupon for a free appetizer. I had mussels, something I never have  ordered and I loved it. Dipped the focaccia bread in the tasty mussels broth. The others were happy with their dishes. Dessert sampler was wonderful, tray of six different desserts, plenty for the three of us. We were given a complimentary shot of limoncello liquor, yumm. Bottega's food is quality and authentic italian. Super service from a knowledgeable server who gave some good recommendations to us. In the past I've tried the flavorful wood-fired pizza and looking forward to that in the future.
An attractive upscale place!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here ever since it opened and with all the rave reviews, but I left severely disappointed. 

The food was mediocre and really expensive for that was served. We ordered the red gnocchi, calzone, and lasagna - none of it was very flavorful or extraordinary. The lasagna lacked garlic or basil and the gnocchi was overdone. There wasn't much to say about the calzone, it was fine. The one thing that did stand out was the pre-meal bread - the focaccia and baguette were delicious. 

I don't understand the hype - I've lived with a couple of Italians who would make such amazing red sauce from scratch, so I was expecting a similar quality. It's a cute place for happy hour drinks and maybe the bruschetta?"}
{"text":"Bf and I wanted to try a new pizza place near by.. saw botegga while leaving zipps one night and decided to give it a try tonight. Sooo glad we did, we had the SALSICCIA ZOLA pizza!  Absolutely amazing Service!  Second to none. Can't say enough great things about this place, it will definitely be our new go to Friday night date spot! It might turn into a twice a week place, after all.. You can never have too much great pizza, can you?"}
{"text":"The restaurant was recommended by my brother and it was superb! It was a Saturday night and a bit packed, but we were quickly seated. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful. She recommended the eggplant parmesan, which was delicious! We ordered the Bottega pizza as our main dish. Unfortunately the bottom of the pizza was a bit burnt, so we told the other waiter about it and requested a new one. Our main waitress was quickly informed and apologized for the food condition and quickly placed a new pizza order. The owner came with our new pizza and also apologized for the incident. The new pizza was extremely delicious and I'm glad we received a new fresh one to enjoy.

I gave this place a 5-star due to the excellent service carried out by the staff members and the owner to make sure we received the best care. And course the food was 5/5 as well, despite the minor issue from the first pizza. I highly recommend this place to anyone and special shout out to the staff and the owner of the restaurant for the special night!"}
{"text":"Manager is hands down the best I've ever seen in any restaurant. Phenomenal customer service and great food! Also half priced bottles of wine on Tuesdays"}
{"text":"I had the gnocchi and my brother had the nutella french toast. Both were very good! Quick service...very nice staff. They had live music during Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"So so disappointed in our dinner tonight ... the previous restaurant Pomo was mine and my husbands favorite in The Valley, and we can definitely tell that the owner(s) have changed. Expensive prices for mediocre Italian food, small portions, & way too many tables crammed into a small area."}
{"text":"I would like to say when I go to a restaurant that I look for hospitality, attentiveness, delicious food, excellent customer service and ambience. 

This restaurant deserves Five Stars in EACH of these categories! 

We have been in multiple times and each time it gets better and better. Here is our breakdown of this amazing place! 

Hospitality- The owners Nick and Chris are amazing and remember us by name. We truly feel like family when we dine here. They have even brought us out Lemoncello shots to even authenticate the true Italian atmosphere! 

Attentiveness- The servers are always attentive to our needs and the needs of the table. They also add excellent insight to their menu and the delicious specials and seasonal menus. There is literally something on the menu for everyone. 

Delicious Food- The wide variety of food that is in their menu is splendid! If it's not on the menu they go above and beyond to create the perfect dish for you. We have been to their monthly wine pairings, Sunday brunch, Happy Hour, and tried just about every special they have come out with! Have I mentioned that we have never been disappointed with any of their food? 

Customer Service- As mentioned before the we have been in the restaurant multiple times and we have never once not seen Nick or Chris there. They make sure that each and every step of your dining experience is perfect. I have never been to a restaurant where the owners round on every single table including the bar to ensure every thing is absolutely at its best! 

Ambience-  Every single staff member is so kind!  From the second you walk in and leave Bottega you are greeted by a smiling friendly face. It is seriously contagious! The entire staff is there to make your dining experience one to remember. Oh and the live music on Friday nights is such a hit with everyone! 

This place is a must try because I promise you will become regulars!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place. We started off with the meatball app and was very disappointed. 2 golf ball size meatballs show up and they were OK at best. They were tough and lacked flavor but the maranara on them was good, that was $10. Too proud of your $5ea meatballs, they should be atleast twice the size and 3 to the order. Oh and how about a little garlic bread with the meatball app. We then ordered the Bruchetta, SO disappointed again. They just take plain bread and top it with diced tomatoes that has no seasoning or flavor. There was no feta, no balsamic or olive oil, just a pile of diced tomatos on bread, Horrible.. We did have a plate of pasta and that was good. It was a cognac cream sauce with sausage and mushrooms. Still this place needs to learn how to season their dishes, try salt and pepper to start. I felt like i was in Sun City, the home of bland food. I will never go here again, very disappointed. I went due to reviews. You have Bland Taste People..."}
{"text":"I came here thinking it was Pomos and was a bit skeptical but right away owner greeted us and asked if we had been there before was super nice!! The service was great, food was amazing and owner came back to make sure everything was good! The pesto pasta was to die for best I've ever had and pizza was amazing!! Definitely will be going back and bringing more ppl!"}
{"text":"Nick has exemplary customer service at this establishment. He is the owner. His food and drinks were phenomenal. My wife and I will be back. His staff is trained to provide the utmost  pleasant experience"}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing. I am gluten and dairy free and I have finally found a place I can go and enjoy pizza with my husband! We love wine bars and good food and this place is both. Take out pizza from here is also really good. The vibe is relaxed and nice. We went on a Friday night and it was very crowded and loud with live music and a large group ordering many drinks. Next time I would sit on the patio in order to talk and hear who I am sitting with. The owner himself came out and introduced himself and gave us coupons for next time! He was so nice and inviting along with waitress. I will be back many more times! 

I'm updating my review because I went again and got the pizzas in the picture. The speck and Brie was the best pizza  I've had there yet."}
{"text":"Needing some comfort following a drs appt in a unknown area, I yelp'd Italian and this gem popped up! Hubby's bolognese was great & my pizza was wonderful! Bright, friendly staff took care of us and we had a GREAT meal. Cool set up for private parties (w/bar up to 90 ppl), nice array of imported pastas, sauces, olive oils... You'll enjoy - do not miss this little taste of Italy!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was incredible the entire evening, food was outstanding (three orders of their gnocchi all agree)"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Italian in the area. Love the atmosphere and the food! Great patio and full bar with a brick pizza oven! Our server was a bundle of joyful energy that made dinner even better. Have been there several times. My only complaints are limited parking and solid but not amazing bread. 

And despite multiple visits, we have yet to try their pizzas despite their popularity and awesome smell. But we love the burrata salad, meatballs and calamari! Fresh ingredients with homemade pasta make their lasagna, risotto and pasta dishes amazing. Their bolognese is excellent but their cream sauces are notable for being rich and flavorful but not overwhelmingly heavy. The eggplant parmigiana was a bit disappointing though as it seemed a bit soggy and overcooked. 

They have a solid wine list with half-off bottles on Tuesdays! Bottom line--you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"First visit here and we will be back!!  We sat out on the patio, such a beautiful night. It was a late meal for us so we were happy they were open a little later on a Friday night. 
We each enjoyed a delicious glass of wine, started with the Focaccia bread, shared the Gnocchi with red sauce and finished the night with Profitterol. Everything was so good. 
Nick made a point to stop by our table to say hi and make sure we enjoyed our evening.  The restaurant has a great vibe.  As we were leaving we browsed through the market in the front of restaurant, I will definitely be back for some oils."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and service. This place really stands out in Glendale. The bartenders are great, quick service, awesome wine selection!"}
{"text":"Delish! Fresh pasta, good vibes, super friendly staff. A definite return . Good value and wonderful menu variety."}
{"text":"The food here reminds me of when I was in Italy. Delicious food, great atmosphere that makes you feel like you are at home. Everyone (staff and customers) are so friendly that makes you want to go back. They have a great happy hour and highly recommend for everyone to try this place. You will be hooked like I am."}
{"text":"Went there on a busy night, but they kindly accepted reservations at short notice (less than 30min), and had a table ready as I walked through the door.  It's been a long time since I've been greeted by such welcoming people; they go out of their way to ensure you have a wonderful experience.  We had the Fig and Brie appetizer, and it was scrumptious!  Everyone at the tabled commented on how the flavors of bread, cheese, fig and walnuts went together so well.  The two pizzas we ordered were out of this world! Dough, sauce, cheese...all of it was top notch.  Also, very happily surprised they had San Tan Devil's Ale on draft AND weekend happy hour (including all day Sunday) YES!  The establishment is kept impeccably clean, and I expect to return many more times.  I wish nothing but the best for the new owners and management.  I cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"What a great night. Came here for an event back in October. Food was so great decided to come for dinner. 
Came for Happy Hour first. The house Red is amazing and only $5! The appetizers for Happy Hour were Devine. 
Had the meatballs... calamari and the aricini.
All delicious!
Then dinner... white lasagna... margarita pizza and eggplant Parmesan ( which isn't fried!!!) wonderful. 
Our server Tiara.. overheard it was my birthday tomorrow.... I certainly wasn't going to say a word. She came out with 3 cannolis! Omg. Fantastic. 
I can't wait to go back. This is true Italian! 
Thank you for a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places. My husband and I are Italian from NY and know what good Italian food is. The menu is awesome and slightly upscale. The pizzas and gnocci are beyond delicious. I am vegetarian (not vegan) and I noticed they have vegan cheese as an option; I may try that next time. I had the squash ravioli last time and it was great too. Great house cocktails as well.

They have a nice patio with bar. Inside or out, it has a nice modern vibe and live music on Fridays. It is one of those places you just don't want to leave.

The manager always comes over to see how everything is. I have never had a bad dish there, whether it be an appetizer, entree or desert.

If they offer arancini when you go, get it."}
{"text":"By far one of the best gluten free pizzas I've ever had. The staff are extremely friendly and the service is prompt. One of the few places we frequent on a regular basis. Only complaint is the gluten free pizza doesn't taste very good if it sits out longer than 15-20 minutes. It's meant to be eaten right away."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant!!  The pizzas are delicious and the Pasta is amazing. The owners are great and help us out with anything we need. This has a small town feel, the owner and employees get to know you and treat you great! We had a memorial service there and the owner and his wife were great beyond words. You will not be disappointed if you go to Bottega, you will have a great experience!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place.  Great ambiance, excellent quality food.  I'm NY Italian and the pasta dish I had, the Norcina had probably some of the best tasting pasta I have had in, well since I cannot remember."}
{"text":"We were SO disappointed to find out after we ordered drinks and apps they didn't have gluten free pizza available. The only reason we came tonight was for the GF pizza. My allergic husband had to settle for an overpriced $16 pasta dish with GF penne. He was so disappointed. The manager was great but really you can't advertise GF pizza if you can't deliver. Our waiter wasn't the friendliest either. Really only giving it 3 stars for the personable manger and the live music."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets 5 stars from me now.  I did give it another chance because last time I was there, end of May, it was too warm inside.  It was PERFECT this time.  Obviously they care what customers say and want and make every effort to make it right.

We were there tonight, myself, husband and a friend of ours.  From the minute we walked in to the moment we left, we were treated like Royal!!!  The food was awesome, Happy Hour menu is great (we ordered drinks off of it) and our meals were all great.  Our waiter, Michele, was phenomenal....he went above and beyond and was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about every aspect of this restaurant.   It felt like a fine restaurant in Italy or Scottsdale! It is a VERY nice restaurant with a casual feeling.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  Food is very Italian tasting, salads are great and the Wine/Beer was awesome.

The owner, Nick, was so kind and was walking around all the tables to make sure everyone was happy in the restaurant and I believe....everyone was.  

Please.......give this restaurant a try, they are my favorite restaurant in the whole valley now.  They know how to treat you, they are not snobs, and everything is reasonable and delicious.  You won't regret it!!!!  We'll be back VERY SOON!!!!!  The desserts were delicious too, thank you Nick!!!!!

Have a great rest of the weekend and thanks for making ours so special

{"text":"Just had their lunch pasta. Fantastic! 
I am a very picky Italian and I very rarely get to eat good Italian food in a restaurant. This wasn't good, it was excellent!'n
Too bad I'm moving to Seattle, I would eat there every week,
My son said he's sandwich was amazing.
He said the bread was delicious,
I wish good luck to these people. Borno fortuno"}
{"text":"We loved the calamari and the soup was fantastic. Our server, Tiara, was knowledgeable and very attentive. Great place to sit outside and enjoy amazing food and the beautiful weather. We are going to returning for brunch this weekend"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! Our food and service were incredible. We ordered a couple of their specialty cocktails..both were delicious. Happy hour was great for a few small bites before our entree. We will be back..probably this week, again. We sat at the bar and she was fabulous...I can't remember her name, she had short hair and was so helpful with recommendations and a few jokes!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Bottega and I've got to say it's a great place. Clean, open, inviting, great ambiance. Had an appetizer with meats, cheese and crusty bread. Delicious! Shared a pizza with my husband and it was great, the crust has a perfect chew and the sauce to topping ratio was perfect. Also the service was outstanding, our glases were never empty and the waiter always stopped by to check on us. All in all, we are happy to visit and it might become one of our favorite spots. Come give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Peroni on draft, first-class service, amazing food and a discount for Midwestern University students. I cannot recommend this place enough - it is the best place to eat in the area without exception."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and had excellent food and service. They have a top notch pizza oven and top quality ingredients. Perfectly cooked calamari and house wine for happy hour yum! Love to support local restaurants like this!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, and friendly service. The plaza where the restaurant is located is also nice with a couple of other shops and is located across the street from Midwestern University. At first I tried out Bottega for happy hour (3-6 daily) and was not disappointed - small pizza, mushroom polenta, and beer for a very reasonable price. Later on, decided to try out the dinner menu. The servers bring out fresh bread with butter before your food comes out. I had the Fusilli Salsiccia and my girlfriend ordered their Alfredo Chicken special with spinach noodles. Both dishes were full of flavor and well-prepared. Both times we were here, we were also greeted by the owner, who asked us how everything was. Overall a great option for Italian food in the Arrowhead area."}
{"text":"First time here and service was amazing! We had a tiny bar mishap but the manager came by and had the drink remade...plus all of the food was super yummy. Arrived in time for happy hour drink specials and ordered the calamari and the polenta gorgonzola dishes - wish we'd ordered double: YUM!!! For dinner, we had the pizzas: Michelangelo, Salsiccia Zola, and Salame Piccante - all delicious, hot and fresh toppings !! Larger than personal sized and plenty to take home. Make sure to try the red pepper infused olive oil for an added delight. Topped off everything with the the delicious and nutty torte Nutella plus the best creme brûlée I've had in a while. Definitely coming back to taste some pasta!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now since it has changed ownership! Had an excellent experience both times! Food, wine, and service were excellent!! Will definitely be back several times!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this restaurant! The staff was so friendly and I could just tell the amount of pride everyone had in the restaurant. The food was so amazing. I had pizza and my brother in law had tortellini. I really enjoyed the ambiance it had a cozy but elegant feel. Outside seating looked beautiful but they were all booked so I'll have to give that a try next time! I am excited we found this place!"}
{"text":"Wife and I came here on a whim. We were not disappointed. The food was great and service was prompt. Our waitress was awesome and friendly. Nick, the owner, came by and said hello. We will be back."}
{"text":"If you have not stopped by this place, head there right now! Quick before the others find it!

To begin we had the meat assortment. The meats were excellent and the olives were exceptional! The portions were just right. For dinner we had the Strozzapreti Norcino. A+! The noodles were homemade...delicious. Firm and flavorful with a light sauce that did not over power. 

The waiter was professional and friendly. He talked with us and was very knowledgeable about the menu. He stopped by often to check on us but didn't hover.

This would be a great place to stop for a drink and light meal after work or  for date night. It is a place where TV's are kept in the bar area and you can have a conversation.

 I will definitely not have the same meal again...it was so good I have to try all the others now!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the owner is nice, and the place is clean which is really the only nice things about this place. They can really work on their servers, we felt we weren't really getting the service we were supposed to considering the prices of the food and it being a nicer restaurant. The plates were small portions for high prices."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE! Family owned and very friendly. The owners recognized me after I went two weeks in a row and asked what my name is. They really want to make sure you have a great experience. Friday nights they have a band. They are getting more and more busy(they deserve it), so I recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"I love good neopolitan pizza. This was just ok. Ordered the regina margarita. Good chewy crust with great wood fired oven char. But the whole pizza ended up being very funny and wet. I get that the texture of neopolitan pizza is different than normal pizza. As I said, I love neopolitan. But this was just difficult to eat. Sauce and cheese became very watery on the surface itself, on my plate, and on my hands. 

I'll probably come try again because it's close to my office. Hopefully today was just a less-than-perfect day in the oven."}
{"text":"Arrived during happy hour because i was getting my hair done in the complex.  Decided to stop in and have a bite to eat and cocktail with my buddy and fell in love.  staff / server was awesome and service was on point.  food was delish and wish i had tome and space to try more items.  ended up having the shrimp and calamari salad and and bowl of steamed mussels.  Yummy."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic! Cheryl took very food care of is. We had the bruchetta, tortellini and mushroom soup and all were great. Tiramisu is homemade and excellent. We would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great ambience. There was live music on a Friday night and it was loud enough to enjoy and not have to scream at each other at the table. Definitely one of my new favorite spots"}
{"text":"This is by far, my favorite Italian place EVER! We go at least 3x a month. The drinks are amazing, the food is beyond delicious and the staff are always fun!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is worst so far from any italian restaurant in the area.
Went for dinner with friends.
Service is slow and we need call attention our server and ask him many times for drink, silverware, menu. 
Fresh pasta taste as canned spaghetti I from New Jersey and grow up with so many italian restaurants neighbour we know good pasta and sauce. Pizza is chewy and undercook maybe because they cook so fast .
Mozzarella watery, tomato sauce no taste.
Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything from appetizers of focaccia bread, fig and brie and meatballs were all very good. I had their bolognese and it was delicious. We all ordered different pasta dishes to taste the variety and all were very good. Great atmosphere, very friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Bottega is a hidden gem in Glendale. We were there for lunch on a Tuesday but the place was really quiet, which is very surprising to me because the food was absolutely fabulous. 

Yelp check-in gave us a free appetizer which we chose on meatballs. It was so savory and the sauce was so good we used bread to scoop up every last bit of it. 

The lunch menu offered assorted half sandwiches with choice of soup or salad. My prosciutto arugula sandwich was really yummy. Seasoning was spot on and the bread was perfect for this sandwich. I also chose their butternut squash soup which was very tasty. It was creamy and slightly sweet and was served hot. It was very satisfying.

Just loved everything about our lunch today. Our waiter was very patient and helpful. Will return very soon."}
{"text":"We went to Bottega the other night and we were very pleased. We used a coupon from a local flavor add about without a doubt we will return with or without coupons. Our wait staff were very friendly and informative. The pizza flour, meats and cheese come directly from Italy. The crust of the pizza is divine and just like what I had in Naples. Great toppings! They had excellent wine choices as well. We did splurge on dessert and had the tiramisu. It is a large very delicious portion and can easily be split by two to three people. YUM! It is now our favorite Pizza place."}
{"text":"Chose this place since it had vegan pizza. Sat down and ordered, they were out of vegan cheese and had no other options to accommodate us. Didn't get an apology and the thing that really upset us was that they made us pay for our 2 lemonades and unsweetened tea instead of comping the drinks since they couldn't accommodate. So vegans beware at this place! You may not get the only thing that would work for you! The server is the reason it has a 2. He was nice."}
{"text":"We went for lunch we enjoyed everything is a little pricey but we loved the ambience and food was good ."}
{"text":"I really wish there was a 3.5 Star option . I will first say we went on a Friday night and it was LOUD and PACKED. We had a large party with a reservation and they were quick and glad to accommodate us. Our server handled all of our orders, different personalities and tastes very well. I had never heard of this place as it's a little trendy and when I find good pizza I generally don't venture out much haha. 

The food was pretty good though. They have quite a few pizza options (that's all I ate so I can't speak to the quality of the other food) as well as gluten free (my brother has a gluten allergy) pizza which is hard to find. I shared a pizza with my wife which was good. The crust was thin, light and chewy and not too much sauce or cheese. I will say this is not a traditional style pizza joint though so it's all very light and fresh ingredients, so if you want greasy heavy pizza, this isn't the place"}
