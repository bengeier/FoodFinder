{"text":"Drove past last night and noticed a new Bakery. Came to eat first thing in the morning to find out it was opening morning for the Bakery. I had the Apple Cranberry Oatmeal, and a  frappe Mocha. Both were very good. Oatmeal was a nice sized portion and very good."}
{"text":"A cafe that doesn't serve coffee. I have gone in at least 6 times for the past 2 weeks and they always have a problem with their espresso machine so don't have coffee available! They haven't bothered fixing their machine, they only shrug their shoulders when I ask how long it would be to get fixed. Very interesting business decision considering Starbucks is 2 shops down. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! One of the girls even memorizes mine and my boyfriends order. If only they were open later than 3pm. I have not tried their breakfast items but their lunch options are delicious. Oh, and the cinnamon roll is to die for."}
{"text":"Over priced garbage. Got a chopped salad and the middle of it was rotten. $8.99 for bacon n eggs. Crap"}
{"text":"This is a review of the Corner Bakery Cafe outpost at the Barrett Jackson auto show, which was such a horrible experience that I will never go to the actual cafe. The service was rude, inefficient, and totally haphazard, and the food was very lackluster.

There were only three full meal items on the menu: chili, panini, or salad, which is fine for a venue like this -- it should have kept things running smoothly. However, we ordered a salad, which they were out of. We also ordered a panini, which ended up taking literally 30 minutes to make. The meals came with a cookie, which they were also out of, and they said we could come back later to get them and they would make a note on our receipt.

As far as the receipt, there was a large sign at the front saying: \"If we do not provide you with a receipt from the register at the time of payment, your meal is free.\"

They did NOT provide us a receipt at the time of payment. I waited until our food was (finally) ready 30 minutes later, when they asked to make a note about the missing cookies. I said they never gave us a receipt, and politely mentioned that according to the sign very prominently displayed at the register, our meal should be free. But the man running the register got huffy, rude, and said, \"I'm not just going to give away food. I can print you a receipt,\" and turned his back to us. He acted like we were trying to pull one over or get away with something. 

It's not like we were angling for free food from the beginning -- but the sign was prominent, we'd already waited half an hour (while the rest of our party who went to adjacent food vendors had ordered, received their food, and finished eating already), and they were out of half their menu items. 

It really rubs me the wrong way when a customer service policy is not honored. If you don't mean it, don't put up the sign in the first place, and especially don't get snippy with customers who ask you about it!"}
{"text":"Thank you to the corner bakery for the amazing service!!! Everyone was so nice and accommodating. The coffee I wanted was out, the assistant manager made a fresh batch. They also got one of our orders wrong so our hero, assistant manager didn't catch her name, went to the back and personally made us a new order!!! The food and coffee was so good!!! We ordered the Anaheim scramble and it was bomb!!! Get the potatoes! And the avocado and spinach power flat! Yes!!! So good! The eggs were fluffy and they use really good sharp cheddar which was balanced out with the perfect avocados!!!! Thank you again! Such a pleasant experience!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with some people from a conference. Since it was close we figured it would be. Good option. It was horrible. The food came out ice cold. We waited over 45 minutes for a smoothie. When I went up to ask about the smoothie the server got a huge attitude and made the smoothie...incorrectly and I had to take it cause we were already running late for our meeting and the line for refunds was too long to wait. I think one person in our group got their order correct. None of the salads were made correctly. It was a joke. I have never had such horrible customer service before ever. The food was okay but not worth it. Assuming you get what you want. The first two menu options I ordered were unavailable at noon seemed a little unorganized and poorly managed by and staffed. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}

{"text":"So I've been a couple times as it's really close to the apartment and it's a local AZ business.  Food is comparable to an Applebee's quality.  Hat's off for quick and friendly service, but nothing ever seems extremely fresh.

I'm glad that they seem to be doing well as the place was pretty full for a lunch rush.  The best meal I've had was the Anaheim Scrambler for breakfast, which I've had a few times.

But today was inexcusable, I ordered the Club Panini...only two slices of thin deli meat!  Are you kidding me?!!!  I've seen 3rd graders make a better sandwich.  It ended up basically just being two big pieces of bread and mayo. 

They do have WiFi, the coffee and desserts are pretty tasty.  The place does offer a bit of variety for the Arizona Center."}
{"text":"Fantastic salads and delicious bakery foods!   Love the patio, clean restaurant, friendly staff.  Great food at reasonable prices.  Plus, management is so cool they come by your table to make sure you have everything you need!  Five star service!!!  Paige is my favorite waitress!"}
{"text":"Great power flat breads for breakfast. Great coffee, too. Priced right. We'll come again."}
{"text":"Great food! Great People! I think I will bring the family here. Servers are very courteous"}
{"text":"Placed an online to go order for breakfast and it was ready in a timely manner and the food was great. Lots of options from fresh to fattening, which I love! The best thing about this place is the customer service!!! Totally on point! Very friendly staff that goes above and beyond!!! I really appreciated their efforts!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to other Corner Bakerys and was thinking good thoughts about my breakfast but alas, my experience wasn't very good.

The Anaheim Scramble was just weird and cold. And the potatoes that came with it were salty and cold. Ick.

And one of the staff people insisted on sweeping up right in front of me. There wasn't a mess on the floor or anything but he just really thought he needed to sweep in front of me as I was eating.

Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Club Panini, chips, lemonade and cookies.....great choice! Got it hot and fresh from the kitchen! 
Place is nice, clean and open on the inside.  They even have some seating outside!"}
{"text":"Went in not knowing what to expect. pleasantly surprised !  more like a healthier, fresh fast-food option.    had half a sandwich and soup combo-  very fresh.  other diner had a pasta dish and a salad.   loved both. nice sized portion.     relatively still new and working out some training kinks, but all went well.     would recommend."}
{"text":"First off, this looks more like a fast food stand then the Corner Bakery I know and loved and I have been in them in CA, IL, TX and now NV. Sorry start for the first Las Vegas location.

 I tried using the mobile app to place my order. I was not happy with the order when I got it home and they forgot my chips. I tried to call to speak to the manager about this and she refused me. I returned to return my untouched meal and complain about the missing chips and speak to the manager personally. Ashley W. . I asked for a refund and she refused me one and told me to contact corporate. I asked for info for this and was told by the manager, Ashley she does not have the info. FYI Ashley, it is on every receipt you print. Last, someone called the cops on my wife and our two children, 11 & 4. The police responded and declared it a waste of their time. I hope someone was not shot or robbed while the Henderson police were responding to the Corner Bakery riots."}
{"text":"Don't come here no coffee for over 15 minutes waited in line change menu to no potatoes or oatmeal"}
{"text":"I like to call this place Corner Inconsistent. The food always tastes great, but it is often not quite what you ordered, and rarely the same from visit to visit."}
{"text":"They have the best pancakes ever!! I find myself craving them and no other pancake compares!! The staff is always friendly and quick to serve. Their croissants are a must have as well! I lead a cycling group and we sometimes plan out routes around corner bakery cafe so we can pop in for a quick refuel before getting back on the road!"}
{"text":"This location is a joke. Although gluten free bread is clearly highlighted on the menu I'm informed they don't offer it by the very poorly trained staff. They have no clue as to anything they can offer as a replacement as they clearly don't know what gluten is. Party of 15 left without ordering anything."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Service is efficient and the food is good, not great. I've noticed that the coffee is not piping hot in the afternoon, like it consistently is at Wildflower. I was there at 2 pm in the afternoon and it was near empty."}
{"text":"This place is adorable. I love the black & white interior and the cozy booths. 

More important than the ambiance, though, is the delectable food. Because they serve breakfast all day, I ordered the most delicious oatmeal of my life. YUM.  My steel-cut oats came with dried cranberries, raisins, brown sugar, and toasted almonds & walnuts.

The desserts looked so decadent that I just couldn't resist. I decided to indulge in a chocolate chip cookie, and, ever since then I've become addicted and have been back to Corner Bakery many times since.

Also, Corner Bakery validates parking for 2 hours (yay!)"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Wonderful customer service.  My husband had the Ham and Swiss Pretzel, and a side of the Mac & 3 Cheeze with tomatoes and bacon. I had the Chicken Carbonara. Both of us totally enjoyed every bite.  The pasta is cooked perfectly and the sauce is decadent and creamy. The garlic bread is so good! 

My only complaint about this place is they close at 8 and I can't get there after yoga if I do the 7pm class."}
{"text":"Service was horrible we waited 40 min for a panini this morning, 1 star after our entire meal was comped, would have been 0!!"}
{"text":"On mill Ave in Tempe, a cool hip place to be but I feel like I've missed out on the cultural of Tempe. Will seek out another place in closer to university. I came from the lake and it was the first place to stop average food."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the food served and the service, but will give them one more try as anyone can have a bad day. Hopefully it will be better next time as I'm looking for some yummy baked goods to comfort my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"This was first visit to The Corner Bakery.  I placed my order to go:  chicken pomodori panini and tomato basil soup.  When I arrived home, my order was wrong.  They gave me a meatball panini and the wrong soup also.  Since I didn't feel like driving back to the restaurant, I went ahead and tried what they gave me.  The food was mediocre.  This didn't bother me but for those who may need to know:  their credit card machines are not working yet so they are only accepting cash.  I'm not sure if I will go back because Cafe Zupas is much better in quality and quantity.  I will say the restaurant was very clean and the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"Slow service, and burnt the bread on the breakfast sandwich my brother ordered. Underwhelmed by the amount of options in the \"cafe potion of the menu. I guess it didn't help that the Starbucks right by this place was closed at the time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the service is great and the food is tasty. I had the Mac and cheese, the pasta was well cooked and the breadcrumbs were toasted nicely. The sauce could have been a little thicker though. The bread served on the side is phenomenal. There is also free and fast WiFi, which is great for staying productive while grabbing something to eat."}
{"text":"Got the chilled berry almond oatmeal and it was delicious. paired perfectly with their dark, robust coffee with a dash of cinnamon.  the staff was friendly and the food came to our table in a matter of minutes. i would say slightly higher quality than a Panera / Paradise bakery."}
{"text":"So glad the Corner Bakery arrived with good salads and sandwiches.  Now I hope they can smooth out the service logistics- simple things like cutting a 6 inch Panini in half so I can eat it easier or having the ketchup cups stocked so I don't have to find someone to stock them (or even better, get packages and save plastic)!  And why do I need plastic utensils for my sandwich order?  Oh yeah, because I need to cut it in half myself.  Finally, don't plan to run in and grab a breakfast sandwich for the road- on average it takes 10 minutes by the time you order and get the food.  OK management, smooth out the flow!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for breakfast throughout the week while at a convention. The first day was great - food was delicious. But throughout the week the quality of food decreased as well as the timeliness of the food being made and brought out. Today I waited 45 minutes for a spinach and egg white panini and I opted to dine in because I figured I would have time to eat before getting over to the convention center in a half hour. After inquiring about my order I was told there was still four more orders ahead of mine. I think they pushed all 'to go' orders ahead of 'dine in' orders because many people who ordered to go people after me got their food. Many people had a similar experience to me. I think they were understaffed, which would certainly contribute to the disorganization. I am confused as to why they do not know how to deal with the 'rush' before a convention begins when they should be used to dealing with being that busy based on their close proximity to the Phoenix convention center. I ended up canceling my order after waiting 45 minutes. One of the waitresses was really sweet and had great customer service skills and dealt with everyone's frustrations very professionally."}
{"text":"Worst ever. Ordered a BASIC panini from a cashier who didn't even look me in the eye. She was talking to her coworker and completely ignoring me. Waited for 20 minutes in front of the workers, finally got up and was asked if \"I needed something?\" I told her I had waited 20 minutes already, somehow the ticket did not go through, probably from the dumb cashier who was acting like a high school teenage gossiping and not paying attention. But whatever, mistakes happen. So they make my panini, I'm still waiting, no manager was told, nor did I even see one the entire time! Are they male or female? Who knows because they were not around, finally got my bacon and cheese panini, the girl told me sorry and I'm walking out to hear \"did you want a refund?\" So while I was waiting for the additional 10 minutes, you never figured to ask that? I said no, I was already late to class from waiting, so ridiculous. Hire better staff!!!!!!! They're all caught up in drama and whispers to even give good customer service."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try this place again after bad experiences previously.  The orders to go were always incorrect and didn't know until I got home.  
First, not one and I mean not one person in the restaurant.
I ordered four items to go. When they bought them out I checked to see if they were correct. The 1 salad was a small instead of a entree. Had to have them remake it. Got pasta and when I got it home there was no bread that was suppose to come with it. The Cesar dressing tasted like fish. 
Next, the cashier was so darn unfriendly. 
When I had to have them remake the salad the manger was pissed and very rude. 
Not one person I interacted with was nice. 
It's too bad that this particular one is ran so poorly. The food is pretty good but won't be there long with the way it is ran."}
{"text":"Took extremely long to make 2 salads and a sand which when there was only 3 other customers in the restaurant. &Forgot a desert item. 
A full staff of lazy teenagers with no sense of urgency. Laughing and arguing with each other on how to make the other customers food. Didn't know what was in the Asian salad and had to ask 2 other employees to get the information. 
When I did receive my salad it was so soggy with dressing and inedible I could not finish it. I returned it, with an \"oh\" from the expediter. 
Nice restaurant but the staff here is lazy and unprofessional to say the least. 
Will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. The service is okay, the food is okay. I think it's overpriced for what it is, although they do give a student discount. I got the tomato basil soup which was cold on top and lukewarm towards the bottom. If you're trying to choose between Panera Bread and this place, go to Panera Bread."}
{"text":"We consistently enjoy the Corner Bakery in Westwood whenever we are down there, so when we heard I've was opening up in Vegas we were delighted.

I'm so happy to recommend this clean, quiet, comfortable restaurant for it's delicious bakery treats! Try it once just for dessert...the lemon bars, or the moist coffee cake, and you'll be hooked.

Try it shine other time for a lunch special like a sandwich and salad.

My one complaint to date is that sometimes the salads are a little over dressed...so ask for \"dressing on the side\" to get it just the way you want.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"This was our second time in about a year to visit this restaurant. The first time was really good. Today, not so good. Maybe an off day? I ordered the Chicken Pomodori Panini. There were no roasted tomatoes on it as listed on the menu. I did show my sandwich to a young lady bringing my daughter's sandwich (five minutes after I had got mine) and she told me she could bring me sliced tomatoes. I told her it was supposed to be roasted tomatoes. She just said, \"sorry.\"  If ever in the area, as much as I dislike Subway, I will go there instead. Just disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is okay but the location is dark and not a great atmosphere.   The food is okay but nothing spectacular.   The server was okay and greeted me when I approached the counter.   I prefer Panera down the street."}
{"text":"First time today and it was Ok. I got the DC chicken salad and it was good but not like I would get it again. I think it was way over priced for the amount of food I got. I paid 10 and it was half a sandwich. I think the atmosphere of the place is great. That's what I would go back for."}
{"text":"This place is freaking delicious. They serve breakfast all day, for those of you who love breakfast. They have combos that give you the best of two worlds. You can get a sandwich/panini with soup/salad or pasta with a salad. Everything there is to die for, but I'd recommend the panini/soup combo of the chicken pomodori with the broccoli and cheddar soup. On a side note, it gets SUPER busy during lunch time on weekdays, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is consistently well prepared and good, the restaurant is always clean and welcoming, and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The prices are completely reasonable. I also appreciate the way the menu includes caloric values for every item. I'm most impressed with the service-- the waiter we had each time we came was so kind and personable. 10/10! I would recommend this place for a convenient, delicious meal, whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner."}
{"text":"This company is very unprofessional if your looking for catering.  The manager Alex was extremely rude and unapologetic over the fact that they messed up our breakfast catering order.  
We removed them from our company catering book and will not be using them again.  The curt behavior also makes me not want to ever eat there personally.  
Beware if your using them to cater an event, chances are you will be left with a room full of people and no food."}
{"text":"The restaurant is ill ceeped,  service was ok and my flat bread was the same,  But it felt iky."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. I got a peppermint mocha and it was watery. However, my panini was very good. My Grandma got a cinnamon roll and she seemed a little disappointed because it didn't seem \"fresh\" (and we got there pretty early in the AM). Their servers though were SO kind. We got a few free samples from the bakery. So there were some highs and lows to our visit."}
{"text":"There really ought to be a different rating system for fast food chain restaurants.  I rarely give 5 stars to anyone for any reason, but as this type of establishment goes, it is appropriate.  This is \"healthy\" and \"real\" food, similar to Panera/Paradise Bakery, except the food and ambience is better.

I've been going here a couple of times per month for lunch (often mid-afternoon) since at least December and the food is always fresh and tasty, the service quick, and the place is clean and quiet, even when it's busy.

I often order the Chopped Salad, but today I went with the Trio (you get small servings of 3 different salads, plus a few mixed greens).  I chose hummus (some of the best I've ever had), Quinoa and Pico (good), and a scoop of tuna salad.

My partner has complained a bit about the sandwiches not having enough meat, but the Chopped Salad is gigantic if you order the Entree size.   The Cafe size is plenty for me, and I have a big appetite.

Don't miss the Black Currant iced tea!"}
{"text":"I placed a simple call-ahead which consisted of 2 orders of Gluten-free toast. I was told it would be ready before I arrived.  After a seven minute drive, I arrived. I waited almost 10 minutes while the cook staff looked bewildered and were unable to make 2 simple sides of Gluten-free toast.  Unbelievable...

If you have an allergy to gluten and you've got other things going such that you don't wish to waste 15 minutes of your time for cooks to remember how to toast gluten-free bread, I wouldn't recommend The Corner Bakery Cafe at Arrowhead Fountain Centre, in Peoria."}
{"text":"Don't order the Cuban press. Had to take it back. What little meat there was so tough I couldn't chew it. Skimpiest sandwich ever for $10?!?!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times. I like the area and the layout and the customer service and the food. Usually I arrive early on a weekend morning so I don't know what this place is like during the week. It's never crowded when I arrive early. 

The coffee is always fresh. The employees are courteous and greet everyone. The food is good. And the restaurant appears clean and neat."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week for a coffee and picked up a great breakfast sandwich. Price was very reasonable and eggs were cooked on a skillet and tasted great. 

Stopped in for lunch yesterday and loved the Rueben sandwich. 

Service was fast and friendly

I'll be back"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and wonderful customer service! The staff is new but are very friendly and willing to help."}
{"text":"Never coming back here for sure. Cashier Benjamin, was a rude and had poor customer service skills. We felt completely unwelcome as he chatted away with coworkers instead of helping us. Came in for breakfast and coffee since this is a \"cafe\". Tasteless and not worth the value. This place gets a star because my coffee wasn't bad. Granted I doctored it up myself, but thanks for the brew Corner Bakery..."}
{"text":"If you like paraside bakery Do not come here!! Soup isnt good . Salad is so gross! Chicken looks like its plastic rubber!! Customer service isnt bad but i would never ever reccomend this!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"For another day of research, I found myself at The Corner Bakery Cafe.  I indulged in a banana bundt cake and an iced tea.  I was there from 3:30pm - 7:30pm and enjoyed the homely feel.  The tables are made of oak and the seats of leather.  It was very comfortable, and the staff there were friendly.  I will definitely keep The Corner Bakery Cafe in mind on days that I need somewhere quiet to work and enjoy a light meal or fresh baked treat."}
{"text":"Perfect location and hours! Great place to grab a full breakfast before going to work. The staff is always smiling and food is delivered hot and quick. Their breakfast is so much more than just some pastries. They really cater to everyone from on the run business and college students to people wanting to enjoy a healthy and full meal. Always suggest this place if you are in the downtown area! No guilt or regrets enjoying one of their pastas or sandwiches. Must try place in downtown Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Ok...didn't even make it to our seats due to the rudest hostess service I've ever experienced. My mother asked what the soups of the day were and the lady pointed at a board that we did not initially see. Then when my mom asked, \"Where?\" the hostess snapped, \"Do you want me to read um to you?\"  Then she turned to the couple behind us and asked if she could take their order.  Crazy rude!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered this for a company breakfast. They came on time and the food was awesome ! We had the yogurt parfait, pastries, and bagels. Everything was fresh and delicious !"}
{"text":"The food was not fresh. Salad seemed like it was made days ago. Cup of soup was less than half full. Staff never seems well trained. Bathroom was not clean, which made me concerned with cleanliness of kitchen."}
{"text":"We find ourselves choosing Corner Bakery quite often   The atmosphere is casual with seating options inside and out. Service is efficient. I always choose the salad trio with many options. The edamame salad and quinoa and avocado are my favorite choices. 
All the soups are good and the panini sandwich is excellent. All their bread is fresh and tastes house made.
We rate it a 5 star experience ."}
{"text":"This place has good food, however, it's a bit over priced. I love their Chicken Pesto Sandwich. You have to try that sandwich! Their lemon bar dessert is not that good. It has a really weird after taste. But their cookies are a home run! They are big, soft and extremely tasty. I always get a cookie when I come here. The place is very clean and the staff is super friendly. The staff is always checking to see if everything is going well. Makes you feel good that they care about your experience."}
{"text":"I have come so many times to this location and have been in love with Corner Bakery. This time they screwed up my order big time. I ordered a trio option and the quinoa salad had an ingredient that had gone bad so I threw that out and my second choice was cavatappi pasta salad and they gave me chicken salad instead and I am a vegetarian so threw that out. So all I ate was hummus and pita for 8 bucks. They need to provide training to their order takers. The dude was so confused. I don't think I will go there again."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Service was very slow, several of the food options were gone, coffee sleeves for the hot coffee were gone, the coffee itself was average at best."}
{"text":"The first time we went to this new restaurant, we were very unhappy.  The bread was not fresh that was used to make our sandwiches.  It was a take out order.  When we got home we noticed that two items were not in the bag.  I tried to call the restaurant several times over a two hour period.  When I finally got through, the manager offered to return our money and buy us a new meal.  She told me to ask for her when we next came in.  I did tell her that their phone rang busy for two hours which did not seem to phase her.  
   
We went back a few weeks later and asked to speak with the manager that I had spoken with on the phone.  I had to ask several times to speak with her after being told she was very busy.  When I identified myself to her, she said she was a very busy person and could not speak with me  I told her, \"so was I.\"  She could not refund my money but gave me 7 $5 gift certificates and paid for a few meal for the three in my family.  When I brought home the new sandwiches, they were terrible. Very little meat and not very good.  Once again the bread was stale.  

Today I tried again.  I used 5 of the gift certificates to purchase a lemon cake and 8 cookies.  While I waited for the clerk to check me out, He was grumbling about having to enter the certificates in the cash register and very loudly yelled, \"shit\" because he had to enter them twice.  There were children in line behind me.  The manager was a few feet away and did not seem to care that one of here employees was to out of control.  He also did not know how to package the cookies.  He ended up putting them in a very large box that could have held two dozen cookies rather than the eight I bought.
I will not be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a Corner Bakery Cafe, and I'm so glad I tried it out! It kind of reminds me of a Panera mixed with a Kneaders Bakery and Cafe. It was pretty busy since they just opened, but we got our food very quickly. They had a lot of options for decent prices, and I was very tempted to buy all of the baked goods. I tried the Choose Any Two option and got the Berry Pecan Salad + 1/2 Chicken Pomodori Panini. My meal included chips and a pickle. I also had the blueberry pie and toffee cookie; they were absolutely heavenly! The panini was delicious, and the salad looked and tasted very fresh. Everyone who worked here was friendly and helpful. Plates and trash were immediately cleared from empty tables, and we had a few people approach us to see if we needed anything. An employee also offered us a sample of their lemon pound cake (yum)! It seems like you are getting a lot for your money, and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went back today and had great food and good service!  The gal that checked me out asked me to complete the survey on my receipt.  So maybe they are trying to turn the bad reviews around.  Hope so cause I really like the food when they do it right!"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast and the Anaheim panini was excellent.   Nice atmosphere and great baked goods."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a movie on a Sunday afternoon.  It was surprisingly busy (but comicon was going on just down the street). Almost all the tables that were empty, needed bussed."}
{"text":"Manager Curtis is super nice and very professional! The food is killer! Way better than Panera or Zuppas! I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken pesto panini and even though the taste was pretty good the bread was not and it was way too long on the grill. The prices are not bad considering the location."}
{"text":"My first time at this place. I really enjoyed the grilled chicken panini and finished up with a whoopi pie. I also saw some other people eating pancakes with bacon. Looks like they have decent breakfast. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Good service and pretty good sandwiches. Great spot for lunch, but parking can be a little difficult on Mill."}
{"text":"I didn't realize there was a Corner Bakery Cafe in Phoenix, and so close to the office.

THE PLACE: Located at the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix. Space is nice and big with comfy decor.  Think Paradise Bakery or Wildflower, but with a slight upscale twist.  It gives you the feel of a small town bakery.

THE FOOD:  Every time, my hubby and I share a Pesto Cavatappi and Spinach Sweet Crisp Salad. And for me, I always have to have a Hibiscus Lemonade with Iced Tea.  They offer 2 sizes for both the salad and pasta, either cafe or entree size, latter being the bigger size.  It's perfect to share, and leaves you room for dessert, which I always say I will try, but never get to. I just fill up too much on the drink.  The Hibiscus Lemonade can be too sweet for me so, I like to water it down a bit with tea or ice or water. I would never skip on it though. My girls always go fro the Old Fashioned Lemonade, that is also good. Corner Bakery also serves what they call Mac & Three Cheese.  My girls always go for this, but I personally am not a big fan and prefer Paradise Bakery's Mac and Cheese.

THE SERVICE: Fair. The staff are helpful should you need help navigating through their menu, or anything else you may need."}
{"text":"Food is good, coffee is good. They have takeout which is good. Cup of joe and a breakfast panini for 7 bucks. Can't be mad at that. 

Staff was friendly and I would definitely come again. Only reason for four stars is it took a few min to get food... But I'm really being nit picky there."}
{"text":"I came here for a Yelp event and it reminds me a bit of a Paradise or Panera restaurant, only better!    The manager on duty saw me waiting outside for friends (before he knew I was there for the Yelp event) and invited me in to wait inside.  I ordered my spinach salad with fresh fruit to go.  The person taking my order just smiled.... Of course, she knew it was delicious and I'd eat the whole thing...!!  The lemon pound cake I had was also great... Very moist... I will return whenever I'm in this area... I appreciated the healthy salad options!"}
{"text":"This is a chain like many bakery or bread companies. . this location is very clean, staff is very friendly.  Nice environment even when busy.  Have been here many time to work on WiFi or for a meeting.  Food is good and fresh.  Wish there were more of these around town."}
{"text":"Meh - typical chain food.  Nothing bad.  Nothing fantastic.  Just meh.

For non millennials - \"meh\" is the equivalent of a tepid black coffee in a Styrofoam cup."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Casual atmosphere with very fast service and great food. We took the kids and the kids meal were great and really cheap. The food is much better than somewhere like Paradise Bakery, and everything seems to cost less also. We will be going back here often."}
{"text":"This is my go to for oatmeal and we've tried many places here near the arrowhead mall.  Steel cut without being too dry but is not mushy my biggest complaint at other establishments. Not a fan of the euro style cold with yogurt but is available.  Love the banana crunch and if you're not a fan of bananas you can sub berries or request berries to be added.  It also has the best pumpkin bakery item around their muffin. It is not a bacon and eggs breakfast place but has options for some healthy lighter fare. All the soups, salads and the couple of pastas will not disappoint.  Going there now."}
{"text":"I have NOT been in the place, but I did eat their take-out via a group project downtown, so I had a decent sampling of their lunch options.

They catered a group lunch for about 50 people, if you will...

The apple-chicken-avocado salad I had with balsamic was very fresh, and tasted really good.

A lot of the folks around me opted for the pretzel-bread ham sandy - which also looked amazing - if for nothing else, it was served on a pretzel roll (and in spite of it's filling being ham)."}
{"text":"Great place. Just found it while getting my car detailed across the street. Food is fresh, the interior is clean. Great place to have a meeting or just work on your computer as well. Highly recommend it for fresh salads, sandwiches and soups."}
{"text":"Wow! Love Corner Bakery. Steak & Cheese Hogie my favorite. Have to give their manager credit while I was waiting for my food overheard a woman being rude and condescending to the cashier. Manager came out from back and woman proceeded with her attitude with manager.. Manager handled her with class.. woman extremely rude.. would not allow manager a word in edgewise.. I wonder why people think it's ok to treat others like this woman was doing.. its very sad. I must say I probably didn't help matters as I laughed at the rude woman.. if your having a bad day stay home for all our sake.. I will be back as this is definately my favorite Corner Bakery location!!"}
{"text":"They should update their hours on Yelp. It's annoying to come here to find them closed at 4pm. Yelp says open til 7."}
{"text":"My first visit to the Corner Bakery was due to a coupon my wife received at her office near by. We have been for Breakfast, lunch and now dinner. The meals are just okay, I never feel they are fresh, kinda reheated. If your meal comes with a bread of any kind, its cold and if you get butter for your toast it too is just a cold square. The staff is friendly enough, way too many people at the register just hanging around. It seems just as your about finished with your meal, someone comes by and says hows everything? Kinda late for that. The place could really do good, great location, great place to meet and sit outside but the food just sub-par. After being open this long, the place should be packed, but its not. From reading the other reviews, the reviews are getting less and less stars, management pay attention."}
{"text":"Right what I wanted when I needed it.

My father has been very sick for the last two months and I stayed in the La Quinta Inn several times over that period which happens to be across the street from the Corner Bakery.  

Every morning I would get a double shot latte with a breakfast to go.  Perfect latte every time.  The girls were really nice and the service was fast and good.  I tried all of their oatmeal breakfast bowls and an egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and healthy.  

A welcome stop every morning.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have no reason to complain about the actual food but I find it rather annoying that they haven't updated their hours. I was very frustrated to find out that they don't close at 6 pm. Another customer came up right after me and they were upset as well."}
{"text":"Had a great experience today! I eat vegan and employee Brittney took the time to bring out the ingredient book to see if I could have certain foods! She was so nice and cheerful! Made my morning!!"}
{"text":"Went to this Corner Bakery today. My salad was okay but the sandwich was really dry and not very appetizing. Service was a little slow."}
{"text":"Hot food and quick service. Just need to check your coffee levels better when it slows down. Thanks for a nice morning. American Scramble was perfect and hit the spot and was only about $6.99 or so."}
{"text":"The food was good, and they had a Friendly staff. I tried their Panini's sandwiches and salads, I was expecting something different, but it was good n delicious enough for the price...I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"I needed a continental breakfast to serve about 40 people for a client meeting.  When I stopped and spoke to the manager, she was extremely helpful explaining to me the different packages available and what would work best for my situation.  

I'm not typically one to use delivery, because I want to know it's there when I need it, but after I told her we'd be picking up a rental and flying by to grab everything at 8 AM the next day, she asked me again if I was sure I didn't want delivery.  I decided to take a leap of faith and it's a good thing I did!   Turns out the rental was not available and we had to Uber to the clients office at the last minute.   The delivery driver called me, I gave her the suite number and she took everything up, so it was ready to go when we arrived.   The client loved what we brought and we loved the service!"}
{"text":"This place was a godsend for anyone involved in the Ironman Arizona triathlon this year. They were slammed from before dawn until late at night and staff were pleasant every time we were there. The owners were visible all day and helping in whatever way they could (which was sometimes standing guard at the mens restrooms to help alleviate the women's line).

The service was much faster than expected for the crowds they had and the food and drinks hit the spot too!

Great example of superior service and flexibility for whatever came their way. The hard work really showed!"}
{"text":"So I live extremely close to the restaurant and frequent often, and for the most part service is great, and the food is better, for the most part, I would say 7 out of 10 times I've gone there has always been some sort of issue and usually they are quick to make amends but yesterday, Easter I deiced to stop in for brunch, I called ahead of time to make sure they were open. I've only ever ordered on thing from here the Anaheim scrambler with pancakes, on this particular day I ordered and sat down as usual, I proceeded to wait for 30+ minutes before I actually received my order and this is after the family next to mine  received their whole order about 15 minutes before  I did and they ordered after us, so once I saw that I went to the front counter and asked would it be much longer I have to hungry children waiting on there pancakes. with an attitude the woman behind the counter told me they were understaffed and doing the best they could so I went back to the table to wait, after about another 10 minutes my food came out the potatoes were extremely cold the scramble looked as if it had been cooked yesterday and just reheated and the pancakes were so cold the butter would not even melt on them. so at this point I was extremely annoyed I told the server what the issues were and again I was told we are understaffed at this point I asked for a manager, the same girl with an attitude that was working the counter came over and said the manager is busy right now I am a manager in training what's going on. so I told her I've been waiting 30 plus minutes and my  food is cold she again said well we are very understaffed today, I told the girl I understand that but if your that understaffed that the food wont be able to come out hot then you should inform people upfront its not right that I paid and waited for plates of food and I'm just supposed to accept the fact that cold food should be okay because your are understaffed, if you are that understaffed you should have considered not opening in the first place, so again with an attitude like she really didn't care about what I was saying she said well what did you want me to do for you we brought you hot pancakes. I mean usually the service and attitudes are so much better in here to the point they have messed up 8 out of 10 of my orders and i still return but this time i feel it needed to be shared so hopefully if you visit this location they have there ish together."}
{"text":"The cake we bought was good not great. But, more than a fair price for what it's worth."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but for lunch on a Saturday, I have waited 30 minutes to receive the wrong salad. Yes... 30 minutes for a chopped salad that came with chicken, bacon and avocado. Came with none of that. Now I am waiting another 10 minutes for the redo. Crazy Bad Service and Super Slow! The thing that I feel bad about is that there is a line and they keep taking orders. Issues are gonna go down today!"}
{"text":"This is the worst corner bakery I have ever been to. Cold food, incredibly slow. Avoid it."}
{"text":"There are so many workers in the front and they can't even keep the rest room clean...disgusting I just hoped the kitchen was clean. I told the cashier about the rest room and was just ignored."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The baked goods are excellent! However, I recommend if you get take out check your order for completion before leaving. The food is worth making a visit!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  The seating was full, but of course when your in downtown and it is lunch time, what else would you expect?"}
{"text":"Great cinnamon roll. Problem with my friends order resolved professionally by Michelle the manager. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We have been staying next door to this Corner Bakery for the past month and have eaten here many times and I have to say they do a real nice job with breakfast, lunch and dinner.  They execute very well and serve a very fresh and tasty product.  I think it's better than Panera Bread."}
{"text":"Just had my first experience with Corner Bakery Cafe! I ordered the Harvest Salad (added chicken) and it was so good- i love the flavor combinations! The portion was HUGE- being that I have never eating here before I got the entree size and I think next time I'll go with the Cafe size, but that's a good complaint! 

I ordered the Kids Pasta & Meatball for my daughter and she loved it as well- I love that the kids meals not only come with a drink, but a cookie too!"}
{"text":"The service was quick and everyone was polite .

I ordered Mozzarella/ tomato panini. 

It had to much dressing and my sandwich was soft and soggy.

Mac and cheese was amazing , perfect cheese amount , not dry and to cheesy."}
{"text":"They weren't terribly busy when I went. I have multiple food intolerance and some allergies. The manager was super nice about it and went through the giant binder with me to find something I could eat. All the staff were understanding and patient. The food was good (airport priced though). Happy experience for me."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them more stars. They have great and friendly service. They are quick and have a lot of menu options. However the food came out slightly cold and the Caramel latte we ordered really wasn't a caramel latte. We will try them again. They are new and got to work out some kinks."}
{"text":"4 of us. Breakfast took about 30 minutes. Delivered cold (who likes cold eggs?). My coffee drink was served with breakfast instead of when I ordered it. Food is very pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Cute spot where I enjoyed the Farmer's scrambler with a side of fruit. I didn't get here at a busy time, so the wait wasn't long. They brought my food outside with napkins and silverware. I heard their WiFi is free, so it's really an ideal place to have a leisurely breakfast, and feel pleasantly satisfied by your morning's first meal."}
{"text":"I love a good salad from Corner Bakery. My usual is the southwest chicken salad and it's always filling. The ingredients are always fresh and of good quality. Sometimes I sub the house salad dressing instead of the one it normally comes with because I love their house dressing so much.

I also love to come here in the evenings when I get a breakfast craving as they're one of the only places near me that serve a quality breakfast all day long. Their pancakes and bacon are delicious! The customer service and staff have always been great.

This location is spacious with plenty of seating including a few comfy reading chairs and an outdoor patio. My HOA board decided to meet here on Saturday morning and it was a great location for that kind of thing. 

Parking is easy to come by on the east side of the building (near the main entrance) rather than on the south side (closer to Fry's/Petsmart) where the lot gets congested."}
{"text":"Come check this place out you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend the Pesto Cavatappi. P.s staff is amazing."}
{"text":"They used to be a bit better, the portion sizes were smaller and just perfect. Their soups are really good, the scramblers are better, the sandwiches are amazing, I love that you can have a healthy breakfast here. The Ravioli is to die for!!! Overall, I love it and I go again and again and again. :)"}
{"text":"One of my fave breakfast and lunch stops, where I can charge my items... lol cell, iPad e-cig battery. There bakery is great. They have this concord tea that is just fab, so is there coffee, if you like hazelnut and cream you'll love there coffee... check em out, I like em way better than there competition over at Panera..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, there breakfast is outta this world. I always get the, \"Anaheim Scrambler.\" So good, it's scrambled eggs w/ Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes, green onions, cheddar cheese topped with avocado slices... Yummmm

The Corner Bakery gives Panera/Paradise Bakery a run for there money, however in this bloggers MIND, no contest. ENJOY... Ps. LocationLocation Location is great, right in the heart of downtown Phoenix, next to Amc Theater"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite restaurant and I am so happy they opened this location. This is the only corner bakery in Nevada. It was the grand opening today and all the staff were incredibly friendly. The food was perfect. It came out quickly. The restaurant is clean and set up nicely. I wish I could give this place ten stars. And it has a drive thru!!!!! I will be back Time and time again. PS the pesto cavatappi is my favorite thing on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that I will definitely never return. I was in drive thru and ordered a chicken flatbread breakfast sandwich and a brownie. Got my flatbread in the bag and they forgot my brownie, so I had to get off my car to go inside and ask them that they forgot to give me the brownie. They all made a face knowing that they did and when I started eating my flatbread I found a disgusting hair omg!! I was just horrified! I don't recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"I enjoy meeting friends & family at here, it's good food & comfortable. It's a little pricy but overall good"}
{"text":"I know people never have time to compliment just to complain but actually I'm going to do both the food here is amazing is always been delicious and fresh all the managers are  friendly and servers however the cashiers are another story I've been here 5 times and all five times only 2 were nice to me the tall black girl and linda they always greet me  and smile at me they also remember my name which surprised me if your going to order please make sure you go to one of them other than that slight issue I highly recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Great food!  Their catering is awesome.  They will make your party or meeting unforgettable."}
{"text":"It is very cute inside and I've tried this place in TX years ago. Went here on a Sunday morning with my husband for breakfast it was not busy at all. I waited about 5 minutes before someone took our order and I had to ask the guy if he could take our order- there was no one else in line. We ordered two small coffees, bagel & croissant. He gave us our number and we sat down. 10 minutes later still no food so I asked the lady wiping down tables if our order was ready yet since it was not a complicated order. She went to the kitchen and came back 5 minutes later stating they should have given us our food at the counter. Finally someone came over 15 minutes later with our paper coffee cups then our baked goods came. My husband loved his bagel and cream cheese and my croissant was just okay. The hazelnut coffee was fresh and delicious. Overall the service was not very good and I just didn't understand how they could mess up such a simple order. I think some of the employees need additional training on the systems and customer service."}
{"text":"Talked with one of the Manager's, Josh today while eating my lunch. I absolutely love this place! Second time in today, and its just a nice place to grab lunch. I only have an hour lunch so my time is spent relaxing and wanting a great meal. I get both being here! The food is excellent and it gets out to me quickly so I don't have to rush to eat. The décor looks spacious and really nice as well! I will be recommending to my coworkers as well as my friends/family :)"}
{"text":"This place was an accidental discovery. What an amazing surprise. They get it. The owner spent a lot of time perfecting the recipes and it shows. You can't go wrong with the maple bacon or the peanut butter jelly donuts. The maple bacon is a beautiful balance between sweet and savory. The PB&J donut is a great twist on a classic. The Nutella donut was my kids favorite. Try the Thai iced tea as well."}
{"text":"They have a friendly manager who comped me when they ran out of bread and croutons. He gave me $15 worth of coupons. However, without that pleasant experience, this place is way over-priced for microwaved food items. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"When will I learn...

Occasionally I like to give places that have disappointed me a second chance.  Today I was running errands on lunch and popped in here to take a sandwich back to the office.  

Let me preface by saying that it had been months - nearly a year - since I'd visited here.  This was due to consistenly mediocre food and the final straw being bright blue peices of rubber chopped up in my salad.  I can't beleive that the staff didn't notice but I did - after I'd already gotten back to my office and did not have enough time to go back.  I had no lunch that day...  

So today I thought - I'll pick up a sandwich to go.  It's been a while - I'm sure things are better.  The sandwich was an \"Uptown Turkey on Harvest Toast\".  It has turkey, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  Well the avocado was so insignificant, I'd actually forgotten it was an ingredient.  The lettuce wilted - not from the toast but from sitting around.  The bread too toasted and burnt in the middle.  What a disappointment.  

I really do not reccomend this place at all.  It's not even worth going back to have my messed up meals 'replaced'."}
{"text":"I actually really like Corner Bakery Cafe! The only downside is that it is pretty expensive for what I like to order. I usually can't help getting both the Pesto Cavatappi and the Reuben Panini, because they both are so good.

I prefer this to Paradise Bakery. I think the food is better and I like the atmosphere here a lot more too. Its a very calm and cozy place to enjoy a nice meal."}
{"text":"I may be a little biased...I really don't care for this type of restaurant. 
I went in for breakfast expecting something completely different.
I ordered the Anaheim Panini and my guy ordered the Chicken Apple Sausage Panini. The food took a little time to come out and the restaurant was FREEZING!
Once the food arrived we asked for forks and got a very strange look form the server...about 5 minutes later we had our forks.
The Anaheim was actually pretty good but the Chicken Apple sausage was straight from the freezer section of your grocery store, yuck! It was so sweet and did not pair well with the rest of the ingredients at all.

I'm not sure if we will ever return, there are just too many better places for breakfast downtown..."}
{"text":"I love love Corner Bakery Cafe.  The food is terrific.  I love the breakfasts and the corned beef reuben panini.  The BIG difference for me, though, is the amazing staff and management here. Manager Dan is wonderful and always checks on customers.  He's friendly and always pleasant. Curtis and Chelsea are terrific as well. Staff make you feel at home:  Cody, Ted, Tracey and Charlie as well as others whose names I cannot recall.

I have never eaten here when a member of the team did NOT come by to ask if I needed anything else or how things were. I eat out at least 6 or 7 times a week.  But nowhere else is the customer service this top-flight. I feel like an honored guest at this restaurant, not merely a customer!"}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch! In and out within an hour. Corner bakery has a lot of great choices, between their soups, sandwiches, paninis, and pastas there is a lot of variety. 

My friends and I each got the pick two which was $8.99 + tax. Really good price for the amount of food you get. I got the chicken noodle soup and carbonara pasta! 

Carbonara pasta (4 stars): I feel a bit guilty giving this carbonara 4 stars comparing it to other carbonara's I've had in places like rome, but for the price pretty decent pasta. Comes with chicken and peas, and It's more so an alfredo with chicken and peas than a carbonara since there's no pancetta or bacon, but nonetheless pretty tasty. 

Chicken Noodle Soup (3.5 stars): Nothing special about this soup but also pretty tasty. Can't complain."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, warm environment. The owner is active in the business and regularly checks in to ensure everything is going well! This store exceeds expectations!"}
{"text":"This place is average. They aren't consistently open when they say they will be. The food is average. The prices are to be expected. There are so many options in downtown Phoenix these days that you shouldn't settle for average! Indulge in yourself - visit a local establishment that will appreciate your business!"}
{"text":"***Update since review on 01/18/17*** I have been back to visit this cafe numerous times and the staff seems to have had obvious up-training since!

I have visited this Corner Bakery Cafe a handful of times and ordered the same thing each and every time. The staff have always been quick and polite. Today 01/18 was much different. 

When I came in, there was but one customer ahead of me that had already ordered and was waiting on his food order. I ordered a mocha frappe w/o whip and proceeded to wait 15 minutes, as the first drink made was not the drink I ordered (it was a truffle mocha-iced). 

Upon delivery of the drink to me, the main associate that has been there from I believe when they opened advised that he had to remake the drink as it required a specific base ingredient (which I understand being a former Barista, but it should not have taken 10+ minutes being the only customer he was serving). When I picked up the drink off of the tray, a portion of the drink had made it onto the top of the lid which proceeded to fall onto my business casual attire. 

Not only did this experience negate all other experiences, it made me 25 minutes late to work and the drink proceeded to drip throughout my car on the drive to work. I'd much rather keep my business with other restaurants that have a service recovery procedure in place and are quick to make fixes, especially when I would consider myself a past-regular customer."}
{"text":"First time here.  The place was clean and cozy.  We decided to split the Turkey Pretzel sandwich as neither of us were real hungry.  When we got up to the counter to order I saw they had whoppie pies.  Well, I have never had one before so we bought 1 and shared that too.  The sandwich was real good and I really liked the pretzel bread.  The manager came over to see how our meal was and even chatted with us for a bit.  There isn't one near us here in Mesa, but if we are on the west side again we would defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Damn good breakfast ... the pancakes in particular are out of this world good.  I like my pancakes buttery with a slightly brown and crispy crust.  I like my bacon slightly crispy as well ... I don't wanna see any fat on it at all.  I like my scrambled eggs with cheese, and scrambled slightly soft.  When ordering breakfast at Corner Bakery and I tell them exactly how I want my breakfast, they deliver.  I love Corner Bakery.  It's one of my absolute favorite places for breakfast and lunch ... especially breakfast.

I've probably had every single lunch item on the menu.  In DC, Union Station, Corner Bakery was my go to place.  I was over the moon happy when I saw the \"Coming Soon\" sign at the Camelback location.  I was super excited! This location in particular has really, really nice employees, super nice.  When dining in, they check up on you often.  You don't have to pick up a thing.  Need extra napkins ... ask an employee when they walk by.  Need a refill ... ask an employee when they walk by.  They're awesome!

If you sign up to be on their mailing list they're send you occasional coupons.  Whenever I open my email and see the coupon for pick 2 for $7.99 I practically run to Corner Bakery. You'll do the same if you've ever had it."}
{"text":"Just ate at this establishment and witnessed some behavior I just have to report.  As far as food goes, it was avg at best. However, as you have read in my prior reviews, customer service is my top priority. So lets begin....

The employee at the counter was great.  Friendly, gave suggestions, very helpful to everyone. Now as I was eating I watched as the manager approached a customer at their fountain drink area and aggressively asked him if he had paid for his drink.  I assume that she did this as he wasn't dressed the nicest and the manager gave off an over privleged arrogant vibe.  He started to laugh and said something to her. She then started telling him that he was stealing.  He told her that he did in fact pay and that she should ask one of her employees. She continued to berate him in front of the other customers until another employee approached and confirmed he did pay for a drink. The look on her face was priceless. I watched as he tried to de escalate and ignore her but she continued to verbally attack this guy.  She eventually slithered away.  I tried to catch up to the guy when he left but could not find him.  Coincidentally, another patron said to me, \"I come here all the time, if you thought that was bad, you need to see how she treats the employees.\" Shame on this business for hiring such a despicable manger and human being. I will not be returning and will tell this story to as many people as I know who value customer service."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and chicken sandwich was amazing! Was bummed they didn't have potato soup but I'll be back. Staff was nice. Little expensive for what it is but so is every thing in the area."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  Not too expensive and better than eating at subway.  Oh they have free wifi and coke zero.  All and all its good but not the sandwich shop I've been searching for.  Sometimes I think ill never find it."}
{"text":"I love the food here! I have had salad, soup, pasta and the sandwiches and I am yet to be disappointed. 
The pesto Cavatappi is very good. I am usually not a fan of pasta but it's that good. 
The soups are all great and my favorite panini is the chicken pomodori. 
If you have room then try a dessert. The coffee cake and whoopi pies are tasty."}
{"text":"I LOVE Panera, but figured I would try this place, especially since it was across the street from my hotel, but I'm so disappointed that I did... 

First thing, any \"To-go\" order should automatically have plasticware and napkins, in my opinion, and at the very least they should ask when you pick up your food if you need some. This restaurant did neither of those things.... how am I supposed to eat soup without a spoon?! 

Secondly, my salad was not fresh. The salad was starting to turn colors.... I uploaded a photo. Also, our panini sand which was stone cold. Needless to say, I'll stick with my panera from now on... or a gas station, quick trip makes better and fresh food for half the price"}
{"text":"Be aware of catering for delivery - as they don't show up!  I placed an order online for breakfast for a business meeting, delivery between 7:45 and 8:00 am, the order showed confirmed... At 8:10 the order was not delivered.  I phoned and spoke with Curtis who said,  yes they were running about 20 minutes late.  At 8:45 I called again, and he saying he didn't know where my order was.  I asked him to figure it out and call me back.   At 9 am, after I still had no call back, I called again, and Curtis, the GM was complaining that he had too many missed orders and incompetent staff.   And then he said he will  \"comp my order\".  Well the order never showed up and the people in the meeting were hungry with no solution.  When I phoned later at lunch to find out who was really in charge of the place a female employee told me the owner's name is Josh, and when I asked for his phone number she placed me on hold for about 10 minutes until finally she came back and disconnected the call.  Then they wouldn't answer my call when I called back.  I phoned later in the day and Curtis answered and told me they couldn't give me Josh's number.  And that he \"comped\" my order so I wouldn't be charged.  Apparently Curtis's definition of \"comped order\" = canceled order!  This is bad business practice, and Corner Bakery North Scottsdale went onto our company's do not use list.  Thanks for nothing Curtis."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food. Huge portions! I ordered a Pick Two, 1/2 of the mozzarella tomato sandwich & 1/2 carbonara pasta. The half sandwich filled me up, so I'll eat the past tomorrow. Priced right & decent food. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today with my fiancee for lunch. I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich with a side of pasta salad. The sandwich was terrible! My chicken had a consistency of tuna like it had come out of a can. The pasta was also bland and had no seasoning whatsoever. For $20, I expected to get something at least half decent. Needless to say, we took a few bites and asked for a refund. I'd like to give them a second chance, but with places like Kneaders Bakery, I'm not going to bother."}
{"text":"It was ok at an alright price. Could have been better. Nothing really memorable other then the places design. The service was pretty low energy."}
{"text":"This is a Panera on steroids, same business model
Good variety on the menu. Sandwiches and salads, classic ones.
Had the steak and cheese hoagie. Good temperature, fresh ingredients, served at table. Overall OK
Love the hibiscus lemonade!! 
They do catering and it is a pretty busy place at lunch
3.2 score"}
{"text":"Good food, but the young girl behind the counter seems bothered that she had to help me.  However, another woman, who was a little older, was very helpful."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place and it was very disappointing.  The first two items we tried to order were not available so we settled for something we really didn't want.  We should have left at that point.  I noticed others have had the same issue.  If you are already out of food at 8:00 am you might want to re-think how you order supplies.  It was 15 minutes before we received our coffee orders and the panini was bland and small with very little on it.  Others may like this place but it was disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"The Corner Bakery was A-Ok! To me it seemed like an elevated Paradise/Panera. I had the Cobb Salad and it was perfectly chopped and dressed.  The desserts looked really good but a little on the pricey side for me to try that day. I'll be back because I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the great customer service."}
{"text":"Very disappointed,  breakfast came out cold, pretty hard to screw up breakfast...not returning again. Pancakes, bacon , all cold...and it as it's my policy not to complain and send food back."}
{"text":"My office is located right across the street from this Corner Bakery location, and it has become a go-to spot for picking up lunch. Good food for decent prices with a nice variety of soups, sandwiches, salads, and pastas; similar in concept to Paradise Bakery. The staff is always friendly and the place is very clean, though I usually call ahead and order to-go since it can get pretty busy depending on the time and day.

My biggest recommendation, ALWAYS CHECK YOUR TO-GO ORDER BEFORE LEAVING. A co-worker and I eat here probably four times per week and 19 times out of 20, they mess up one of our orders in some slight way. She routinely orders/pays for a bowl of soup, only to find that they gave her a cup instead. Or one of us will order a baked good, only to find it's never in the bag when we arrive back at work. The sandwich is supposed to come with chips & a pickle, but they'll frequently leave those out if you order a combo. Little things. Not enough not to come back, but we do feel bad having to go back to the counter to complain every time we receive our food; especially when it's busy and we're rushing to get back to work. 

The food is consistently good, so mistakes aside, I am still a frequent customer here."}
{"text":"I stopped coming here last year because the counter staff is rude and either they require an IQ of 85 or less or they have bad management because they very rarely smile, don't seem to be able to read and pass trash that is right in front of customers. Like, my job is to deliver food, noone told me to pick up trash from tables... Back of the house is good though.  Food is good, service is bad.  I won't be back.

Go to Matt's or Starbucks instead..."}
{"text":"The food was very good, place looks new and clean. Ordered the Anaheim panini based on the picture provided in the menu, it didn't look anything like it. I was kind of disappointed that the avocado wasn't in the presentation, apparently it was baked into the scrambled eggs. However, Skylar was kind enough to get me a side of it. Thank you! She saved your store from a less than 5 star review!"}
{"text":"Yummmmnm, I don't know if it was because it was free or I was hungry but the sandwich hit the spot. 

There was a seminar at school today and they catered sandwiches from Corner Bakery. The sandwich I picked had some sort of chicken and arugula and boy was it delicious ! 

Will check them out when I'm hungry again next time."}
{"text":"- We were there Tuesday March 13th.
 
     This bakery was just Okay, not so satisfying. My advise is keep on walking to the next one.

     I will not come back that's for sure. I feel like because we had our backpacks on, we were treated less than the business people that were coming in. Like Hello?? Our money is just as worthy, so please show a little more attentiveness and care next time!! To other backpackers that is, because WE won't go back!! 

      Also the food was just okay it seems like they have more pastas and sandwiches than baked items, besides our turkey sandwiches lacked flavor or something. It could have been better overall, waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Tried dinner last night her with my teenage boy's. Service was great. Place was super clean. Great drink options. Food was good, my soup could have been warmer and the same  with the boy's Mac and cheese. We will try it for breakfast next time."}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast, the food was okay but the service was terrible. The gal running the register was rude, 15 minutes after being open she was still counting her till and made us stand and wait for her. She was very short and curt, it was clear her mood was effecting the rest of the staff. We ordered a sandwich toasted but it came I toasted, my toast was cold, couldn't melt the butter and the eggs in our flat were a big clump so every bite we took was falling out. No reason for us to return."}
{"text":"Not nearly as nice as the corner bakery in Tempe. Kitchen looked a bit of a mess. The steel cut oatmeal was runny and everything seemed pretty dingy. Upside, The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"The first time I came here (about 2 months ago) it was an awesome experience. The staff was friendly, helpful, energetic and the food matched it. However, the last 2 times I've been here have been awful. The food is still pretty good but the staff have been horrible. No greeting or hello, not knowing answers to simple questions, and overall not accommodating. Even when bringing my food, it was just plopped down on the table and then walked away. No asking if there was anything else needed or even telling me to enjoy it for that matter. Not sure what has happened with the staff but it's off putting and makes me not want to visit anymore. Extremely disappointing and hope it improves."}
{"text":"Nice décor, nice service, nice food.  Great variety of salads, soups, and sandwiches to choose from.  Loved that i could get a breakfast sandwich at lunch.  Made me happy."}
{"text":"Best cafe in North Scottsdale!  I've been going to the Starbucks in Kierland for a while and for laptop warriors, this is the better option hands down.  You can walk from Kierland to Corner Bakery in 5-10 minutes.  There's plenty of seating and the tables are spread out.  The off-peak internet speed at Corner Bakery is is 20-35 Mbps (cox cable) vs Starbucks (Google Internet) which is 8-15 Mbps.  There are also electric outlets near most of the tables.

The staff is really friendly and they bring the food to your table which means no standing in long lines to order and pickup.  I've been to several other Corner Bakeries throughout the USA and this is the mot upscale and largest one I've seen.

They have a variety of salads, pastries, sandwiches, soups and even some gluten free options.  They even have crayons for the kids.

Parking is plentiful and convenient."}
{"text":"Staffs are super friendly especially the owner Jim who was cleaning tables! This place have great food and fresh!"}
{"text":"A new addition on Mill Ave ... And a pretty good one, I'll say! The Corner Bakery has a variety of selections ranging from paninis (both for breakfast & lunch) & salads to pastas & soups. Both the times I've gone, I've had lunch sandwiches. The first time I tried the D.C chicken salad sandwich & the second time I got the Chicken Pomodori panini. I definitely preferred the panini.

They're pretty fast at getting orders out even during the busy lunch hours & the prices compared to other places like this (Panera, Paradise Bakery, etc.) are about the same.

Their bagels, cookies, & cakes always look really tempting ... Will be trying those at some point!"}
{"text":"There was a discrepancy with my order...the server was very nice and corrected it promptly. Ordered gluten-free bread--was very excited about it, given I don't get to order it very often in restaurants, but then was told they were out...would suggest keeping more on hand"}
{"text":"Ordered the Cuban press sandwich which was horrible. One thin slice of ham on one end of the roll and a small amount off pork at the other end of the bread. Ham was over cooked and pork had no taste. Not like the Cuban sandwiches I have ever had before"}
{"text":"Took my boys here for lunch and everyone was happy. Food was good, service was great, and environment was clean.We will be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is a dump every single table was dirty and unclean not to mention you have 15 people on staff standing in the kitchen not doing anything at all meanwhile you have one guy taking orders, delivering them to tables and trying to bus. Food is way overpriced for what it is and that's if they actually get your order right in the first place. Definitely will never be coming back to this dump of a place I wouldn't be surprised if there were cockroaches in the kitchen. Whoever the manager is needs to fire his entire staff and start over. I have been to other corner bakerys and this by far shouldn't even be considered one."}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend on Tuesday.  Presentation inside was good, it was clean, not cluttered.  Some restaurants have too many themes going on, but Corner Bakery keeps it simple.  We were greeted by either a manager or owner upon entering.  I ordered a breakfast sandwich and my girlfriend had an Anaheim panini.  Both were delicious.  I was really impressed by the breakfast sandwich, it was both tasty and yet not messy, despite having a bunch of ingredients.  Their menu is similar to a Panera's, even with some mouth-watering desserts (I'm getting the Monster cookie next time).

Service was solid, everyone was friendly.  I will definitely go back.  Some of you might think this is just because it's the second day it was opened, but I trust they know what they're doing.  Should be a more popular place as the good word gets out."}
{"text":"Great service very clean exellent food and super fast servioce would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a hot drink. I got a chai tea. Unfortunately, it tasted a bit like Vick's Vaporub smells. I dumped it into the trash bin and filled it with coffee from the carafes. The coffee was on par with QT coffee, which was a vast improvement over the chai.

On the other hand, the baked goods looked delish. The sandwiches and salads that passed by me also looked rather tasty. However, since I didn't actually try them, I can't say for sure.

Nonetheless, I think this is a good addition to the Arizona Center -- a nice choice for a quick and fresh lunch."}
{"text":"Great lunch! I had the Uptown Turkey Panini and it was amazing! I would definitely order it again. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Ordered from the breakfast menu... Food was okay... Nothing to run home about. The service from the cashier wasn't the greatest but I can't hold an entire review to just the cashier. If I'm in the area and wanting a bite to eat, I'd stop by again."}
{"text":"Catering was fantastic!! No need to ask for the best breakfast and service in Scottsdale - just know you will get it!  The perfectly cooked eggs, the thick bacon...wonderful; The sausage, the croissants...the best I can ever remember eating! The croissants were hearty and so many layers of flake and butter, your mouth will be watering from your first bite to your last:) the sausage is in a class of its own and everyone raved about it as much as the croissants! You have to taste it to understand. 

Looking for professionalism? Look no further - and ask for Sara! Julie, the catering manager will ensure an excellent beginning of your day and stage an opportunity for you to have the best, morning meeting ever. They have you covered - on time, all accessories,quick set up- they bring everything you need!

Don't bother second guessing this as your first choice. Corner Bakery in Scottsdale is an absolute ringer!"}
{"text":"Just a quick review to give ya heads up that yes, they're open at 6Am for us early birds, but only the drive-thru is taking orders. If you want to dine-in, the employee taking my order said the restaurant opens at 7am.  Kinda bummed cause I wanted to see what was in pastry case, but it's all good.

But so far so good. For $8.29 I got scrambled eggs, bacon and 3 pancakes. Very good bargain for quality they dish out. I really liked the pancakes! The Truffle Mocha was okay. They charged additional for soy milk. There's only cinnamon rolls and croissant listed for pastries in the drive-thru, but the do have cookies, and whatever is in the pastry case for sale. Everything was packed in sturdy plastic containers and was still warm when I arrived home. 

Service thru drive thru was quick. Less than 5 minutes. Then again at 6AM, I was the only customer there. The pathway for  drive-thru is narrow and might be a tad difficult for larger vehicles to navigate, so drive slow and carefully!

Overall pleased with my experience here despite having it to-go. Looking forward to try more and dine in soon."}
{"text":"Pure and utter dog poop. 

Asked for an \"Anaheim Scramble\" with some orange juice. The cashier told me they didn't have juice. I asked if they were out. She replied no, and that she even thought it was weird they didn't carry any juice being a breakfast place. 

My scramble comes out and the waitress who brings it to me looks at it oddly before serving it to me. I ask her why she looked at it that way. she said no reason. I insisted there would be some reason to eye my eggs like that. She showed me the eggs were under cooked and runny and returned it to the kitchen.

What she brought back was some sort of Frankenstein's monster of a scramble with stale toast.  See picture for further reference."}
{"text":"First time ordering lunch here and will definitely return!  Co-worker picked up the Turkey Pretzel Sandwich for me with accompanying bakery chips.  Everything tasted fresh and the stoneground mustard-mayo added a nice bite to the sandwich.   The bakery chips have a very nice crunch and remind me of kettle chips....which I enjoy!  Looking forward to trying their breakfast next!"}
{"text":"I hate this place so much, they always take forever even though they have 10 people working the 5 orders... I don't understand how they can be so unorganized and unprofessional in front of the costumers. Way over priced for the mediocre at best food. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast experience I have ever had! 30 min from order to food, cold eggs, cold potatoes, burnt bacon. Ordered a muffin and it wasn't brought out. I asked if the food delivery guy could grab it and after 10 min I finally got up and got that from the front. Manager seemed unenthusiastic about helping, greeting with only a head nod and walked away. Very poor will never return."}
{"text":"Can't be counted on to be open during hours posted on the door. Twice in the last month we've tried to eat here on our way to Symphony Hall and they were closed, even though the hours post stated otherwise. Saturday my wife called to see if they would be open at 4:00 PM on Sunday and was told 'yes until 6 PM'. She and her friends arrived at 4 PM only to see a sign saying they closed at 3:30 for their Christmas Party.

Food and service is always great, but have a backup plan in case they're closed"}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered a Chicken Carbonara to go from this Corner Bakery and we were disappointed to see that it wasn't correct. I brought it back to ask the employees if this was indeed a Chicken Carbonara, and they took it out of the bag and said it was. We've had this dish at other locations and it looked completely different. On their menu they listed the pasta to be linguine but the one we received was cavatappi. It's frustrating how they lied to us instead of admitting their mistake. We later looked at the menu once again and found out they gave us Pesto Cavatappi. What made it worse is the fact that it tastes like boiled noodles."}
{"text":"I was super excited when i saw the finally opened one of these out here! I used to frequent one in southern California all the time. I got the Santa fe salad and the uptown turkey. The salad used to be my absolute favorite thing ever. But this time it was nothing special, I honestly think Panera is much better. The sandwich was good, but nothing I will go out of my way for again."}
{"text":"I'm in a rock and hard place because this was my hidden gem I discovered recently. I want them to do well so I needed to write a review to help them stay around. Place is all around great. The food is so good. Great breakfast and lunch. Sandwiches, salads, baked goods. The place is delicious"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast fast food place to go to! It so delicious and the customer service is always great! They have a variety of foods and the best thing for me is ordering in the drive thru! I will keep going back and I even brought my family as well! It's have everything from breakfast to dinner! Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Dear Lord, please let my childrens soccer games be near Matts Big Breakfast and far, far away from any of the awful chains on Bell.

Do you want to throw away a chance at an awesome Saturday breakfast? Come on down to corner bakery. God knows why I would ever return to this place. There are so many great bfast spots out there but even crappy Denny's is better than this. My wife asked for ice for her not fresh lemonade And was told they don't know if they have any. This is Arizona a freakin desert for Petes sake. Then I asked for my potatoes to be extra crispy b/c I remember the last time they were cold and undercooked then she pointed to a metal bowl on the counter and said they are already cooked. Yuck! Who the hell doesn't cook when you order? Even fast food does that. I should have turned around and walked out but we were running late for our nephews soccer game. Not that this place is even fast. You would think with their precooked food I would have my meal by now as I am writing this with their wifi. \"Do you think our eggs will at least be fresh?\" My wife asked. I was thinking the same thing. 

The food came out and it was disgusting as predicted. The potatoes tasted like they were a week old and ran over by a dump truck. The egg scramble was edible but I could have cooked a better one after drinking a fifth of tequila. Even the bread was cold and stale. That takes some serious technique. 

This place is neither a good meal, quick, a value, or even worth the plumbing in the building. If we all stick together and never return they will be forced to shut down. I know I won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"Simple lunch order here. Will need to try more items for full review, but it looks like the same menu every other chain mid level sandwich shop offers. Sandwiches, salads, half and half stuff and some pasta. I just ordered the yogurt parfait and it was good sized for $4.50 with alot of vanilla yogurt, blueberries, strawberries and granola. Overall, it was a good version of the parfait and breakfast is available all day and that is where that item is located on the menu. Most places, this item is already pre-made, but I like the fact that it is prepared fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place! I work upstairs and think I gained 15 lbs the first month they were open. The desserts are excellent (my favorites are the chocolate bundt cake with white frosting and the lemon \"pies\"), as are many of the food items. Only thing I wish is they would add clam chowder to the list of soups, as that would be the best option to go with the bread bowl. Staff members are friendly and helpful, and they always have a lot of people working."}
{"text":"Up in North Scottsdale to do some shopping, and ran across this place on yelp (listed as one of the less expensive places to eat it).  When we first walked in and saw the prices, I was a bit skeptical of the $ indicator, but when the food arrived, I became a believer.  The price is not necessarily dirt cheap, but the portions were good and the quality of the food was excellent.  Even simple items like their scrambled egg turned out very well (fluffy, well cooked).  The avocado flat bread was very fresh tasting, and for ~$4 ended up being a great deal given the amount of eggs/avocado in it.  The flat bread also had a crunchy texture - overall a very pleasant surprise.

For those that have experienced Kneaders (which my family and I enjoy), I'd call Corner Bakery a step up from Kneaders in terms of food quality and value."}
{"text":"Great food. I eat here whenever I am in town and the food and service is always great. They go above and beyond to ensure your meal Ok and experience is good."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, atmosphere, food, and overall vibe!
I love stopping here after my daily power walk to power up!"}
{"text":"This place is great...try any of the pastas or salads they're amazing. Can't  wait to try the breakfast items."}
{"text":"Quick stop here for a snack after a matinee. I was impressed with the $2,99 light pomegrante orange smoothie, it was quite tasty and I am a semi-smoothie expert. It was a new item. I also tried a 99 cent apricot walnut rugelach, which was unappetizing and was way closer to its expiration date than needed. As I was looking for a place to sit to wait for my drink, i noticed most of the tables were quite dirty. Lots of employees standing around, but it was all about the smoothie on this day."}
{"text":"The pros: the service at Corner Bakery Cafe was great. I know this location recently opened so all these individuals were recently trained. I got a lot of free pastry samples. My tea was great. 
The cons: Since this location just opened the line was long, the place was crowded and loud.  I got a pesto pasta for lunch that was not great. I've never eaten at a Corner Bakery before so I didn't realize it was like a Wildflower or a Panera bread. I would say go to Wildflower Bread Co. instead of here. I've had much better pasta and pastries at Wildflower and the prices weren't much better here. This is a great location with good service but I wasn't thrilled with the food."}
{"text":"So this place is lacking in customer service with the exception of the guy who put our order in. He was amazing. But we had placed an order to go and had to head to drop a friend at work. The woman came out and called our name, and was even asked if she was calling for us, her response was yes. So shame on us for not checking our food, but being in a hurry we just left. Upon getting to work we realize that it was not our order. So I head back to get our food. There are two people at the counter, the female employee Ashley who had given us the food right off the bat starts making insulting excuses, claiming that it was our fault, then I corrected her that we even double checked the name. No apology, no kindness, just rude excuses. So then I get our food, and I decide I want to know her name, I turn to go back and the male employee leans down to her and I read his lips saying, watch she's going to ask for the soup you gave her, which was not the case, so I ask her what her name is, she informs me it was ashley which was followed by oooooohhhhhh by the customers, which was pretty funny. The food was just ok,not worth the price, my pesto chicken pasta had like 3 pieces of chicken and it was cold, couldn't even try to keep it warm based off their mistake, but will NEVER go to this place again because I don't support rude people. The only reason it is getting 2 stars is the gentleman who took our order."}
{"text":"The official opening isn't until June 5, but I stopped by last week to check things out. The place is bright and spacious, and the staff is super friendly. I'm going to a soft launch event over the weekend, and will update after. But if this location--the first Corner Bakery in Nevada-- is as good as those in other states, I'll be a regular. 

UPDATE: I was lucky enough to attend the soft opening today, June 3. The good news: This Corner Bakery, so far, is as good, if not better, than others I've been to. Staff were all super friendly and, despite this being the first time they've served the public, everything was perfect. No hitches at all. 

I ordered my favorite breakfast--the All-American scrambler with eggs, bacon and potatoes. I subbed an everything bagel for toast (no extra charge). Delicious. 

Anyway, think of Corner Bakery as a less yuppy, just as tasty and far less expensive Panera Bread. And it blows away Zupa's down the road. The pastas for lunch and dinner are particularly amazing, and the baked goods are delicious...and evil. Last pro-tip: Make sure to try the Blackberry iced tea. So dang good."}
{"text":"Friendly service and consistent food quality.  Staff is helpful and greets you with a smile. 
Very nice outdoor patio area in downtown Tempe overlooking Mill Avenue.  
Great for people that work in the are that want tasty and affordable lunch.  
Some of my favorites are the \"pick two\"  Asian edamame salad and Chicken Pesto sandwich.  You get alot for your money.   Wide array of breakfast and lunch choices."}
{"text":"One star is a gift for  the chocolate chip cookies and 1.5 starts for the brownies and 1.5 stars for the raison pecan things.  Now the cinnamon coffee cake is good but poor shelf life.  I saw a server touching food with his hand a BIG NO NO.   Its a walk up pay first joint.  No ambiance"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I love the energy of the staff and the food is amazing. You can really tell all the ingredients are all very fresh.

Bryan and Curtis are very friendly and warming people. They made the experience very worthwhile and display excellent customer service to all who enter.

I can honestly say that this is the most refreshing experience I've had at a restaurant in a very long time. Thank you so much and I can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food although the service is always hit and miss.  Today I had the Anaheim Scramble which is eggs, cheddar, bacon, tomatoes, green onions and avocado.  Comes with potatoes or fruit (I had fruit) and toast for $7.69 +tx.  It was very good and very filling and the fruit was very fresh.  I also had  a mini bundt cake and Hibiscus Lemonade.  Its too expensive to get every day but worth it as a once in a while treat that is tasty too."}
{"text":"I was in the downtown Tempe area this morning and have been wanting to try Corner Bakery. I went in and there was maybe 2 other customers in the whole place, it was 8:45 am.  I was greeted right away and when I was ready placed my order.  Tried a Bacon and Egg Flat, Pumpkin Muffin and a bowl of oatmeal with bananas, honey and cranberries. Although on the smaller side the breakfast flat was quite good.  The muffin also very good, moist and tasty, the oatmeal I could have made at home but was lazy, it was good but try other things like pancakes when you go :)  My problem was with the service, there were more employees there than customers and yet my order was still missing my muffin because the girls were just chatting and not paying attention to details. The food here is really quite good, but the service.....not so much, now granted I think they haven't been open long at this location but if the service doesn't get better, they wont stay open."}
{"text":"Nobody at this place on Saturday afternoon, but that is too be expected with no students or workers available. The large chicken salad had way too much lettuce and needed more fresh veggies and probably a few more slices of chicken. The avocado made the salad better, but it needed more crunch. They forgot the rolls with the salad, but when we got the rolls, they were not good anyway. I did get a free cookie for signing up on an email list and that was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Bylo to trochu jako o pejskovi a kocicce. Toust s krutim masem, rajcetem, k tomu spenatove listy, avokado, jahody, mandarinka, rozinky a jako priloha smazene bramburky v pytliku. Nemaji moc ciste stoly a trochu chaos v organizaci."}
{"text":"An exercise in stupidity.  Literally every employee I talked with was beyond clueless about everything.  They messed up my order and the two who dined with me.   It's clear it's a ship of fools run by a bunch of idiots.  Sad because overall the chain is really pretty good.  This one is a big fail so far"}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and inviting. The decor is really cute and homey. Their chicken carbonara is to die for."}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood. Great sandwiches. Service good. And a manager that cares. I observed him going to every table asking people how the meal was. Talking to all taking any and all suggestions  to improve 
$25.00.  Two sandwiches two drinks and a shared dessert 
To the manager Dan Jones"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place today.  It's similar to cafe zupas and Panera but feel like the food is more fresh. They also serve breakfast all day. I had a chicken spinach panini and Santa Fe salad. Both were delicious. Prices are reasonable for lunch. You can choose 2 Items for under $10. Hoping they open one in the southwest side of town."}
{"text":"I have tried this fast casual option a few times for breakfast and have been generally impressed so far. I tried their \"commuter breakfast sandwich\" most recently, it was good but raw tomato is a weird and unnecessary addition, a watery tomato doesn't work with a light croissant. Blueberry muffin was really good, a benchmark for any quality bakery. 

I would compare it to Panera, in terms of ordering/service style, soup/salad/sandwich offerings and bakery items, but they also offer a lot more than Panera with full breakfast plates and several pastas for lunch. I also think the atmosphere is a little nicer and slightly more upscale than Panera. 

Everything is very reasonably priced, especially for the portion sizes and service is quick. They also feature an online ordering system for an even faster visit."}
{"text":"Kind of a Paradise Bakery rip off... Service is good.  Very clean.  Ordered their Uptown Turkey sandwich and it had two tiny pieces of bacon that looked like it was left over from breakfast and and even smaller (tiny) pice of avocado on it... Why bother?!  Still a good place to stop for a quick bite - coffee and desert.  Would like it to have a more hip / local feel, but this place feels like a franchise."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here, food and coffee were good, and Lorenzo was extremely nice and professional"}
{"text":"Had a really nice lunch here. Food came quickly, despite the lunch rush. Similar to Panera but I think the portions were more generous. Wife had the cavatappi cream pesto, which she really liked. Daughter had spaghetti and meatball with fruit cup... she ate the whole large meatball. I had a trio with tortilla soup, edamame salad and quinoa pico salad. Wasn't a fan of either salad. The quinoa salad was overly spicy (and I like a spicy kick so be warned). We would go back but I would just order something else."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from an acquaintance and thought I'd give it a try. It just opened recently, so I figured it was worth a lunch trip to see if it was any different than your typical chain \"cafe.\" The verdict -- not really.  It is a mix between Wildflower Bread Company and Paradise Bakery. 

The food is so-so -- not as good as Wildflower, but slightly better than Paradise Bakery. I had their panini and soup combo. The panini was fine and for the soup I had chicken tortilla, which I must say was pretty tasty. Their bakery selections, however, did look delicious! And they do catering, which might be nice if your having a small gathering or a work meeting.

The staff seemed very friendly and helpful. I was greeted by a \"hostess\" when I entered and then directed by another \"hostess\" to an open ordering station. The dinning area is pretty large, with plenty of places to sit as well as a good sized patio. 

All in all, it was a nice experience. The food wasn't anything spectacular -- and for being what it was, was kind of overpriced  -- but decent nevertheless. I am not sure if I'll go out of my way to visit here again, but if I'm in the area, I may stop by."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff and a varied menu. I ordered a trio with soup,flat iron sandwich and small salad. I found it very satisfying."}
{"text":"For a quick and fairly inexpensive bite, this place a pretty good. The kid's meals have large portions and come with drinks. I can also count on having a healthy salad that fills me up. My husband really enjoys their paninis, especially the steak one."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! The food is fresh and delicious...staff is always friendly. My favorite at the moment is the Choose Any Two, I go for a BBLT and a Cheddar Broccoli Soup. Best combo ever! 

I always go through the drive through but I am looking forward to take the time to dine in."}
{"text":"Nothing special, manager or cashier lady acted all weird because I was using a free coupon for signing up in there email club. I also asked her do I need to print out coupons or can I show on phone, she never answered me and was rude!!! I saw bfast plates being served as I was waiting,  looks like food I can get at home. My free pastry pie though was great."}
{"text":"What a nice place to start your day! Allen and I stopped into this bakery to grab some Breakfast and we keep coming back.
Javon is a perfect example of what great service in tails. Smiling, greetings and what service. My day can't go wrong with this type of start, get your day started off right come and try out this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to corner bakery. It was $11.00 for an egg sandwich with a coke. It was so greasy it was barely edible. I got my food to go and I didn't feel like driving back to complain. I definitely will not go here again. I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Excellent Food:  Cuban Sandwich and Steak and Cheese!!   Great friendly staff. Clean!! Beatiful Decour!   Lemon Pound Cake is Wonderful. Service was great.  Puts Panera to Shame.   The Manager is very engaging professional and polite!"}
{"text":"I had set out on a mission for some Hot Cheetos to cure this sniffling due to a cold. Eff the Cheetos... I found Corner Bakery!

I walked in for the first time, captivated by the smell of fresh bread and soul food, and kindly asked the staff for something spicy to help get rid of a stuffy nose. Without hesitation, she suggested some Tortilla soup, and a southwest panini... excitedly I thank them for their time and proceeded back to my building with a bottle of Tabasco...which I now realize would have been an insult.

I take a bite of the Southwest panini and quickly realized I should have planned my funeral sooner because the flavor was so incredible I thought I'd died and gone to food heaven. I don't remember a time where the food was so delicious I had to stop was I was doing and photograph this amazing lunch provided by the Corner Bakery gods... I couldn't tell if I was crying from the jalapeño heat or stumbling on my newly found hot spot.

My advice to new patrons... ask the gals there what they'd suggest and they won't let you down! I will be a regular for sure from now on :)"}
{"text":"We have an expression in the software industry that is called, \"Out of the box experience\" and the whole thing is about what is the experience like for a first time user, who just turns on their new computer, or has just finished installing the software ... in other words, how is it going to be like for your mom? Well, I can tell you that the OOBE (out of box experience) for the Corner Bakery is confusing. The entry is jam packed with stuff, and there is a sort of mouse maze off to the side. There is no one to tell you how things are supposed to work or anything. But hey, it is not impossible to figure out after standing around for a while waiting for your eyes to adjust. The food was pretty good, and the pumpkin bread was really good. The coffee was good as well. All in all, it is a nice place, and I plan on returning."}
{"text":"Sometimes the third try isn't the charm. 

I dropped by Corner Bakery around 10:30 this morning to pick up something to take with me to work. As usual, the space was charming and clean and they had someone ready and waiting to take my order.

I decided to order something I hadn't tried before and went with the Chopped Salad. I sat down to wait. And I waited. And waited. And watched a bunch of employees standing around doing nothing. And waited. And listened to the manager whine to another employee like a sad sorority girl -- right in front of me. And waited.

If it were possible to grow lettuce in 20 minutes, I would think that's what happened because I was the only one waiting for an order (there were a couple of other people there, but they already had their food).

Ugh. Seriously disappointing. And my salad was nothing to get excited about. I enjoyed my other two visits...but there is nothing I hate worse than not knowing what kind of service I'll get on my next trip. You have to be consistent to get 5-stars in my book and with so many other choices in the area, it'll be awhile before I give them another try."}

{"text":"One of my bests kept on telling me how they were a fan of Corner and wanted to share the Corner bakery goodness with me, so, we went for brunch, well she was driving, so, she did have first choice. Anywho, the Arizona Center location we went to that Saturday, was inundated with a long line of people, mainly women (found out there was a women's convention taking place, and it was the lunch break). My friend was concerned the quality would not be as good because of the many patrons but I maintain the belief that if you're a good resto, regardless of how busy you get, your quality and service should not slide. Anyways, after a 40 minute or so, wait, we ordered. I got a Southwest salad, the cheddar broccoli soup, and a maple pecan bar. My friend got the Pesto Cavatappi. We opted to sit out on the patio since the weather was gorgeous, and waited for the food to be delivered. Upon receipt of our food, my friend noticed her pasta dish was lukewarm and not hot, so, it had to be sent back. The bread served along with my soup was cold and wasn't worth eating, the salad was not that great especially since it was drenched with dressing, it might have been wrong for me to assume but many other places I've been to, the dressing is usually served on the side as to allow the diner to decide how much dressing they would like to use. The soup was okay, nothing exceptional. The only good thing was the sweet because the maple pecan bar was moist, and not too sweet. It was around 1:50pm and I was gonna go back inside to refill my drink and found the doors leading to the patio were locked, so, I went to the front and found the doors locked and that was at 1:55pm (they close at 2pm). I kept on knocking and even called them through my phone a couple timee, so, I could tell them i was at their patio and wanted in, so, i could refill my drink. After what took close to 7 mins of constant knocking, a customer in the resto saw my debacle and let me in. As I was refilling my drink, I approached the server, who had delivered our food to tell them of the locked patio door. Her excuse was that someone should have told us that sitting on the patio can possibly get yourself locked out if you're there within the last hour before closing. I'm gonna  be honest and I find that it's outrageous they lock their doors without checking their patio to see if they have patrons sitting outside, and I think it's stupid to have a patio and restrict people to where they can sit an hour before they close. Personally the food is not that great, service was lackluster, and the overall quality was just BAD. Will i ever consider coming back? I think not, and lastly, do something about your patio situation, it doesn't make sense. Oh, and this is proof how it's a crap resto when they're unable to maintain food quality, and service at their busiest periods. It's a shame."}
{"text":"I was quite pleased with my last trip to Corner Bakery. While their macaroni and cheese is average as best, their salads are fantastic. I especially like the spinach sweet crisp salad. It was delicious! I also tried a lemon bar which was fabulous as well. The bottom was a little hard as if it had been sitting out all day but it was good nonetheless. I got my food to go and found that the service was both polite and prompt. I definitely see myself returning to Corner Bakery in the future!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped into Corner Bakery Cafe before an event last night and the two of us are split on our decisions if we like the place.  I ordered the Steak and Cheese Hoagie and he ordered the Roast Beef and Cheddar Sandwich.  We ordered our sandwiches to go because we were't sure if we'd have enough time to sit and eat or if we'd have to walk and eat.  

-My husbands roast beef and cheddar sandwich was not very appetizing.  The sandwich was basically a ciabatta loaf with a few slices of roast beef and lettuce and tomato, and very dry.  He said it was something that he could've made, but better.   By the time we realized they had mustard and mayo by the drinks we were on our way out. He literally ate 1/3 of the whole sandwich.

-However, My steak and cheese hoagie was pretty good, I thought. It had caramelized mushrooms, onions and red peppers. (I might add it traveled well!) 

Given the chance to return, I probably would but my husband would not.  Therefore, I am giving Corner Bakery Cafe only 2 stars."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've had in a long time, which is weird because I've eaten at the Corner Bakery in Houston and from what I can recall it was pretty decent. I had lunch here last Saturday and chose the salad trio of tuna salad, cavatappi pasta salad and the toasted sesame kale salad. After ordering a staff member let me know that they were out of kale and asked if it was okay to replace with kale with mixed greens, I was fine with this. After receiving my plate it looked pretty delicious, but after the first few bite of each salad it was only downhill from there. The pasta in the pasta salad was so overcooked to the point that when I would take a bite of it the mushiness would fall apart in my mouth. Instead of the toasted sesame salad, I received a mixed green salad which included a few croutons and tomatoes and an overly sweet balsamic vinaigrette which was just empty calories. Finally I tried the tuna salad which was the most edible thing on the plate. I'm not sure what they put in it but it was very watery and tasted sweet. I maybe had about four bites of the whole meal before giving up. In addition, a few other people I was with had complained that their chips were stale. I have no reason to return."}
{"text":"I eat at CBC in San Diego all the time. This place was absolutely slammed because a huge conference just got out for lunch and they didn't have the staff to support the demand. I ended up waiting 24 minutes after ordering (plus line wait time) for a sloppy thrown-together sandwich. No time for apologies. I'm sure they're good when they aren't completely slammed but I wouldn't know."}
{"text":"Okay breakfast that satisfied the after workout hunger. I had the Anaheim scramble. Pretty tasty   My one suggestion would be serve it really hot. It was a little cool by the time it hit the table."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch the other day because she was in the area and wanted to try one of their new salads. I was excited for some girl time, so hurried over to meet her! 

I ordered the 1/2 Southwest Chicken Salad & 1/2 Uptown Turkey Sandwich combo. Holy portion control, this combo was MASSIVE! The salad would have been big enough for my entree and the sandwich was packed with turkey, bacon, and avocado. The sandwich ALSO came with a bag of kettle chips! For the combo + a large iced tea,  my meal was $13 {a little on the pricey side} but seriously, so much food! Both dishes were delicious and I would order them again. The bread on the sandwich tasted so fresh, it was fantastic. 

I would absolutely come again! I hear that their breakfast is fab as well!"}
{"text":"First timer over here!!! Everyone is very nice the food was good  . Love the part when you get your drinks you have a lot of selection to choose from. You have the try there cookies  I got the monster it's this m&m cookie soft and chewy"}
{"text":"First heard of the corner bakery on a trip to California and glad to see that they have come to Arizona.  They offer good sandwiches and soup, as well as breakfast items and you better try the baked goods."}
{"text":"Was delightfully surprised, it's really quality food, small portions, and not super expensive. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Love their brunch and it's never super packed!"}
{"text":"We've had lunch and breakfast here a few times now. In general it's an okay place to grab a meal. Basically the same kinds of food as Panera or Cafe Zupas. 

Feels a little bit on the expensive side for what you get. But their pastries are pretty good. And their breakfasts are fairly good too."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed in this restaurant. The lettuce was wilted in the chopped salad. Here was almost no avocado in it either. The kids pasta had about 15 noodles in it. The cookies were stale and the service was week. Seemed like no one cared about the food nor the service."}
{"text":"Great food fast with friendly service.  What else could you ask for?

This place is across the street from my work.  So we go there all the time.  The food is consistently good (never a problem).  One of the best things about this place is how fast they get you in and out.  30 minute fairly healthy lunch?  No problem!"}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast panini... REALLY!!! Cheese must have come from the dollar store because not only did it not melt in my sandwich but you can actually count the 4 slices of cheap cheese slices. At least the free ice water was refreshing & helped get down to two bites I had. Two thumbs down ... they only get one star because there isn't a zero star option"}
{"text":"I have eaten here almost everyday last week while visiting Phoenix. I'm glad that this place is across the street from the hotel as a better alternative to room service. From the paninis to the baked goods to the pasta, I have yet to be disappointed. Too bad we don't have one of these back home."}
{"text":"Clean environment. They have paper and crayons for children and their prices are great. Bought a little Bundt cakes for $2.49 and a Power Flat with bacon and added avocado for $1.00 more. The flat is mini but still I only paid $9.50 for everything including drink. They have tons of drink options. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"$5.45 for a bowl of soup and 1/2 a roll (literally the roll was sliced in half). While the broccoli cheese soup is very good I could get more for my money elsewhere....a lot more!"}
{"text":"When the Corner Bakery sign went up I have to admit I was pretty excited. Who doesn't love sandwiches, soups, and muffins? So I was really looking forward to having one down the street. 

I finally had a chance to visit for dinner. My first impression walking in was that this place was really clean. I guess it should be because it just opened, but hey you never know. Also, this place was very overstaffed, like 15 employees and 3 customers. Maybe they were still training? Unsure, but the service was great. The girl that took our order was friendly and even offered some suggestions with making my order into a choose 2, which I thought was nice. Good customer service!

But the food? Meh. As other reviews have mentioned the servings were really skimpy. I opted for a side salad with my meatball sandwich and it came on a small plate with literally a handful of lettuce. Sure its a side salad, but still it was on one of those small plates used for your table bread. The meatball sandwich was hearty. I would order that again. The entree serving of the bacon mac and cheese arrived in a bowl was half filled, which was kind of sad. Also ordered a bowl of the baked potato soup. 

The best things about Corner Bakery that are in the drink department. It's all about the coffee and the lemonade. I totally dig the variety of flavors and the quality of their lemonades. Definitely a place where I would just stop by for a drink or something from the bakery. Yum!

The food was good-- but was it $40 dollars good? Not really. But the real problem is that within that total I didn't even get to order a chocolate baby bundt cake. Ha! That's the real disappointment here. Basically, if there was some sort of lunch debate happening between Panera Bread and Corner Bakery, my vote would go to Panera. 

Sorry, Corner Bakery."}
{"text":"Bad customer service with attitude, mediocre food. Had DRY half of avocado blt sandwich and bland Mac & cheese. Sad waste of $."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been waiting for this place to open, because it looked so good. We finally went today and weren't disappointed. It is very similar to Paradise Bakery (price and food wise), but in my opinion is better. They have sandwiches, salads, soups, pastas, and paninis. Both of us got the chicken pomodori and it was SO good. Super flavorful and filling. This place gets super busy, but there is a ton of space so you won't have trouble finding a place to sit. They will bring your food to your table and also grab your plates when you are done. Great food and good service. We will most definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out lunch from here, off their \"Signature Sandwiches\" menu. It was incredibly mediocre and not even close to being worth the price!

I got the Roast Beef & Cheddar. 
There was not a lot of meat on the sandwich, and it was average roast beef, not any different from what you get at WalMart. The sesame bread had a decent sesame taste, but was rather hard and stale. The lettuce was brown and wilted. The cheese... the cheese! was that fake kind of american processed cheddar, not real cheddar. It tasted gross, like a school cafeteria. The mayo.. not sure what the deal was, but I suspect a ton of MSG because it left a burning sensation in my mouth, the type usually associated with preservatives and flavour enhancers. 
Literally the ONLY positive about the sandwich was the two slices of tomato which were fresh and crisp. that's it. 
I couldn't really tell the difference between this sandwich and one of those pre-wrapped ones you get at Circle K. 

This is not a place where you are going to get a GOOD LUNCH. It's basically an over-glorified and overpriced cafeteria for lumpens with no sense of taste. 

The place was clean and the staff was friendly - this prevented a 1 star rating. 

Colour me NOT IMPRESSED by their sandwich offerings. Corporate mass-produced foods dressed up as a trendy cafe."}
{"text":"I found this place while educating said \"man-friend\" on the joys of using the yelp phone app instead of dining at IHOP or Denny's. I really liked the in and out feel. Order at the front take a number food appears. I like it. The coffee was actually really good too. The food was so/so. I really did enjoy the atmosphere. Interesting layout and decor. We will be back I'm sure."}
{"text":"Chocolate chip cookies are the bomb! My favorite is the chicken pesto sandwich. House salads are great here too. Their fruit smoothies are yummy! Only been here 4 times but I think it's great for brunch!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. Staff was friendly. Took a little longer than expected to get our American scrambles. When we started eating we found the food to be cold. The eggs weren't just cold they tasted as if they had been refrigerated and not warmed up enough. Wouldn't have even gone if we had known the food was all made beforehand."}
{"text":"We used to have these in TX. This location is pretty good. Long lines, but the food tastes great. I always get the cobb chopped salad and a pumpkin whoopie pie - droool! (Pumpkin is the best of the 3). Only complaint is that the portions are small sometimes, so don't go as often as I could, but taste is great."}
{"text":"Food was quick and tasty.  Quiet environment where my friends and I could talk.  They even gave us all free desserts!  Staff is super nice and polite, especially George.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time trying yesterday, I ordered the California grille sandwich tomato soup and Caesar salad Togo. I get home and open my bag and they forgot my tomato soup. The sand which was really good but they basically give half sandwiches here like Panera bread for the you pick two. The salad was really good and I also ordered some pastries. The lemon cake was hard and my blueberry icing pastry wasn't that pleasing. But I will definitely be back for the sandwich and salad."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a good soup, sandwich and sweet treat...as you can imagine, this place does it for me. I enjoyed my sandwich (chicken pesto), soup (chicken tortilla) and my desert (fudge brownie) - they are were all really good. The area where this location really shined - the customer service. From the order to busing the table, all of the staff I encountered was super friendly and willing to go the extra mile for great customer service."}
{"text":"I'd definitely skip this place I your in any sort of rush, with your children or both.  in the evenings it appears as though they have a robust staff of two people working.  Which apparently means they need to make one order at a time.  I'm not looking for fast food at a place like this, but 45 minutes for pasta?

After posting this, it turns out they FORGOT to make my food and bring it to my table...BRAVO !"}
{"text":"This will be my new go to spot, I love it. It's very cute inside and I'm a fan of good bakeries but the food is good too. I've had their breakfast- pancakes, bacon, eggs and coffee. We've come for dinner too- I had their Santa Fe salad (one of the servers said it was very spicy but it was just right to me. My husband had the panini meatball sandwich and chicken noodle soup. For drinks I had a hibiscus, pomegranate, agave lemonade (the bomb) and my husband had a root beer. The service is on point. Just an overall pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"We love this location for Take Out. Ordering online is a bit confusing but the food is always ready when promised. It's flavorful and presented neatly. It's certainly the lunchtime choice for comfort foods."}
{"text":"I've never been to Corner Bakery Café.  It's the old location of Miracle Mile right off 20th St. near Camelback Rd.  I had breakfast with my best friend today and it was a great place to meet.  I really like ambience of the restaurant and no crowd to deal with .  Next time shopping will be included in our outing"}
{"text":"First time at this Corner Bakery. They had a considerable selection of breakfast items, along with seasonal offerings such as Pumpkin Pancakes, which was what I ordered., along with a side of bacon and an iced tea for $9.82 plus tip. 

The service was pleasant and the restaurant was well laid out. There were multiple drink options, with eight soft drinks, three teas, horacha and coffee. The self serve condiment station had sugars, jams, mustard, mayo, ketchup, Tabasco, et all. 

My breakfast, Pumpkin Pancakes, arrived in 7 mins. They were large, fluffy and full of pumpkin spice. The bacon was a bit 'loose' but I hadn't specified my preference for crispy bacon. 

Good meal all in all."}
{"text":"First time at Corner Bakery. I arrived at 11:50 on a Monday at it was hopping inside. The line moved quickly tho. 

There were lots of choices for: sandwiches, paninis, soups, salads, flatbreads, pastas and drinks. I ordered the 'Choose 2' option and ordered 1/2 roast beef and cheddar sandwich plus a cup of cheddar broccoli soup, plus a drink for $12.03. 

The location is nice because there is a park-like area just outside. Plenty of seating inside for the Phoenix summers. 

My lunch arrived in 8 mins and came with a bag of kettle chips and a dill spear. 

The sandwich was outstanding, with a fresh sesame ciabatta type roll, lettuce, toms and balsamic mayo. The veggies were crisp and everything was fresh. 

The soup was thick and hearty, as broccoli cheddar should be. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast - good food at good prices. Gee we'll have to try it for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is ok if you ever get it. Plan to wait at least 30 min for a simple salad plate. I had to take mine to go or miss the play I was seeing. Once I got my food (hummus, quinoa salad and chicken salad) I ate the hummus (bland) and the bread. Threw the rest out - gross. This is my second at this place - there won't be a third."}
{"text":"Pumpkins pancakes were delicious.  The apple sausage was OK but not the star of the show. Coffee was smooth and service was pleasant.  It's a pleasant change from Panera's."}
{"text":"So the question is; will you miss the chocolate chip cookie?

We've lived in other places and have really missed the Corner Bakery chain until we found one here.  Au Bon Pain is a close second in our book (east of the Mississippi).  But my question above is in reference to Paradise Bakery.  If Paradise didn't give out those cookies,would we still like them as much?  I think not.

The Corner Bakery gives good value for the money and I really believe they are more generous with the meat on their sandwiches.  CB excel at soups and salads, with interesting takes on some classics.  Our favorites soups are their Zesty Chicken Tortilla Soup, Roasted Tomato Basil and Mom's Chicken Noodle.  We also like their Southwest Avocado salad, Asian Edamame salad, and the Cavatappi Pasta salad.

Corner Bakery also gives you some of their home made potato chips with your meal, which you might grow to like over a certain chocolate chip cookie.  LOL  Expect to pay around $8 or so for lunch, with a drink.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick breakfast. Nice spot. Warm cinnamon roll after our meals. Smoothies pretty good.  I like the potatoes that come with meal, the wife didn't care for them, more for me!! A little pricey, but this was close to hotel we stayed at."}
{"text":"One of my top 3 favorite foods is salad which I get teased for all the time. Corner bakery creates amazing salads and is my go-to place for them. Their panini options are also great so I typically take advantage of their pick 2 option where I can get half of a panini and a ceasar salad. 

I've never had anything here that I didn't like. The workers here were attentive, speedy, and checked in on us to make sure we were happy. I know this is kind of silly too, but I really enjoy the fact that they offer kids Crayola crayons. Cheap crayons at other places make such a huge mess on the table while you wait for your food and stick to your palms as you color. My daughter and I are appreciative.

I've also never been to a Corner Bakery that bad a drive-thru which is a nice touch because sometimes getting in and out with my toddler can cause issues. Especially if she has fallen asleep."}
{"text":"The food was fast, service was good.  I ordered the Harvest salad and liked it a lot.  The chicken was perfect- juicy and not packaged.  The bread slice that it was served with was very tasty with a sprinkle of rock salt on the top.   The cinnamon roll was a perfect combination of soft and sweet- not too crusty on the edges.  I would recommend for a quick lunch or breakfast!"}
{"text":"Very very friendly staff! Very well kept and cleaned. The food is pretty good and good price as well. I don't live on this side of town but if im around ill definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Glad to have a corner bakery nearby. The pesto chicken sandwich is always excellent and the bakery items are delightful."}
{"text":"What a cute little place to enjoy lunch! I had the chicken pomodori with a loaded baked potato soup as recommended by Cynda.  Cynda was entertaining and informative and made it a delightful dining experience. This made a very stressful day disappear! I highly recommend this corner bakery cafe for lunch or brunch.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Love love their service here! The 50¢ hot coffee/$1 for iced is a DREAM. I absolutely love the classic grilled cheese and tomato soup is just perfect. During the winter season they have chilli soup on Wednesdays which is something to ALWAYS look forward to. For breakfast, I absolutely love the lox bagel. Salad person? Get the Cobb with chicken! I was working across the street from here and I was literally here every day if not every other. Love this place"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Asked for a large iced coffee and wasn't told that this comes in one size only and that is small. This despite the fact that they have large iced drink cups and the coffee is just sitting out. Ordered a scramble and was not asked if I wanted fruit or potatoes and was just given fruit. Then told it would be 15 minutes if I wanted potatoes instead. Once I got it, it was literally just a plate of eggs. I could have made this at home for a fraction of the price. Portions were small and price was expensive for the quantity and quality of the food. Liked the look of their lunch menu but due to the disappointing breakfast will probably not come back to try it."}
{"text":"Trapped on the wrong side and super starved after my workout, this was not the fix I needed. It is average on food, great on customer service. I like the cute corner spots to eat as I wanted to be hidden from anyone at this point. 

Ordered half sandwich/soup combo. Meh. The tomato basil was chunky, too sweet and missing the main ingredient basil. The chicken pesto signature sandwich was no superstar but provided nourishment for my withering body. Highlight pickle spear and baked chips. 

I'm too young for this crowd though I adore old fashion charm and wit. I think I rather do Wildflower or Paradise for this cost of blah. At least Paradise has chocolate chippers and Wildflower has the best hand lotion in their bathroom."}
{"text":"20min- coffee wait
22min they found out they lost our order
33m28sec to finally get our breakfast

Breakfast was comped. Apologies accepted. 


Food- is dry maybe because I already judged it before tasting it and probably because the experience left a bad taste in my mouth
Wish it was a better experience."}
{"text":"Another recent addition to what I consider 'restaurant row' on Stephanie, this place was very cozy and pleasant.  Had their meatball Panini with salad.  Very tasty and filling.  Friendly staff who are down to earth and not overly pleasant to where it comes across as obviously fake.  Look forward to another visit soon.  My wife has had breakfast to go here on several occasions and this was her first sit down (as mine).  She'll be back as well."}
{"text":"The menu selection is nice. Hot pastas, paninis, sandwiches, soup, and salads with lots of \"sweets\" for dessert. The only problem we've had there is as follows: we were there for dinner one night and decided to get salads. It took forever for them to bring them out and when they did, the lettuce was so cold it hurt our teeth to chew and the chicken was still frozen. Frozen chicken! The manager stopped by to ask how everything is and, while he was a very friendly guy, when I told him our chicken was frozen he said, \"oh let me see what's going on back there.\" He left and never came back. We were pretty much the only people there.  (who thinks of going to corner bakery for dinner on a Friday night) I would have appreciated an offer for a new dinner selection or something. We suffered through our frozen chicken salad and left."}
{"text":"Great food, great people and great service!! I have experienced a mistake or two in the 20+ times I have eaten here and both times they handled it with grace and care. Definitely stop by and try the Turkey Pretzel Sandwich and baked potato soup (I get it with the bread bowl)."}
{"text":"This was exactly how 3 stars are described \"A-OK\"

My mom really wanted a salad so we figured we would try this place out. It was very Panera/Paradise Bakery-esque. Soups, sandwiches, salads. You order at the counter & they bring out your food. I ordered the macaroni & cheese & half of a turkey panini that came with bacon, I asked for no bacon but I should've asked them to sub extra turkey INSTEAD of the bacon. Lesson learned. Food came out quickly & I immediately had to giggle at my sandwich. It was literally the tinniest thinnest piece of turkey with tons of cheese. So I guess you could say it was a grilled cheese with a little turkey o_O

Anyways, the macaroni was really tasty & the sandwich was just okay.  My mom loved her salad & their teas were delicious! I noticed they are open for breakfast so we may try it again, next time I will be sure to ask for extra meat if I get a sandwich."}
{"text":"4 stars - location 
4 stars - atmosphere and service
2 stars - breakfast

The egg sandwich just wasn't good.  I am used to eating breakfast at Panera and it is so much better than Corner Bakery."}
{"text":"Good friend and I swung into cute cafe, which was totally unfamiliar to me. Initial reaction is that their marketing did a great job. The second reaction is that the kitchen needs to stretch a bit. Reuben is average size but deserves a rye bread, not sweet raisin rye. Thousand island dressing was appreciated. My friend ordered two scrambled eggs; they were served dry and cold. Toast unremarkable.

I did grab the nicely prepackaged sweet crisps for home munching. Pretty expensive indulgence."}
{"text":"Lunchtime was weird. Their credit card machine was down and they had to go old school with that. There was one poor dude whos credit card was declined 3 times and the manager said that it was not their system. Until my work credit card was declined. 
Anyway, the food was very so-so, service was attentive and I wished that I liked it more than that. 
I am still a fan on Paradise Bakery, though I am not sure that I have Yelped anyone of them. Put that on the list to do."}
{"text":"Hire more people during your busy times.  No customer should ever be told to call back to place a catering order because everyone is busy.  Another helpful suggestion is not to have complete twits answer the phone."}
{"text":"This is a brand new location and my first visit here.  Overall I was quite impressed with the delicious turkey/bacon panini, roast beef/cheddar sandwich, and chopped salad we ordered.  The Chicken Noodle soup was served to me lukewarm and when I complained they offered to microwave it for me...not sure that meets health code standards, but hey...I guess they'll get the temperature setting on their soup heater correct in the future. 

The service was fast, the staff was friendly.  There was one error that I did not complain about, that being I ordered a small chopped salad and was given (and charged for) the entre large version.  But hey...good help is hard to find and the kid operating the register looked like it was her first job, so I did not sweat her about the $2 difference.

In short, the food was quite good and I'm looking forward to trying their drive-thru.  It reminded me of Panera Bread, but not quite as good or as large of selection on the menu."}
{"text":"Great place for yummy and good quality food, especially for breakfast! Instead of getting an unhealthy breakfast at a fast food drive thru, come here !! There are lots of options to choose from and the service is always welcoming and friendly! And the prices are very reasonable considering the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the staff.  Jesse greeted me and arranged a small conference room on the fly.  He is an asset to the company, even asking if I needed parking validation.  

The lemon bar I had was also very good.  

Only gripes?  The wifi was out, was unable to connect to the ASU wifi.  There was also a major leak in the men's room.  I hope the management gets it together and supports a staff that is trying hard.  The place was VERY clean."}
{"text":"It was just eh. Nothing to brag about. The food explains why the place is dead, especially for a prime lunch hour. I'm surprised this place is even still open."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time and I am definitely going back. The food we had between us was all fabulous. The soup was terrific. I had the chicken tortilla and it was delicious. The DC chicken sandwich was good and I plan to taste other sandwiches in future weeks. The Internet is  great. The customer service is outstanding. Every single employee is smiling and helpful. It is obvious that the owner is working with the staff. He introduced himself to us and then we saw him helping the staff all around the store. He was friendly and encouraging to the staff and I love seeing that. The desserts were delicious. Can't wait to go again. Already told a few of my friends about it and I'm thrilled it is in the neighborhood. If you like Paradise Bakery (which I don't) head here instead. Hands down-this place blows them out of the water."}
{"text":"Rude people and cold food.  I took my food up because it was cold and I had waited a long time.  They just microwaved it and the gal acted put out.  I expected it to be remade.  Dont eat here!  Nobody smiles here."}
{"text":"Always a great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Great prices for flavorful meals in a spotless atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Corner Bakery and I was Not Impressed. I was excited to try it because it is similar to Paradise(which I like) , is a similar concept and they are building A Corner Bakery near my office in the Biltmore area.  For starters the Panini maker was broken so I ordered the Spicy Chicken Tortilla soup in a bread bowl which pretty much included like two tablespoons of soup, it really needs a side cup of soup as the bread bowl doesn't really hold a whole lot. The Bread bowl was tasty but the soup was just warm. They forgot to give us two cookies that we ordered and we had to go back up and ask for them, then they were out of the M&M cookies my sons wanted. We had to go back up to the counter and ask for forks. The kids meals were reasonably priced @ $4.95, The soft drink for $2.50 was not. The portions were somewhat small, my wife's sandwich & soup wasn't hot enough.
Two Stars, would try again but won't be on my radar for dining choices."}
{"text":"Food and beverage was good. I think the service is subpar although staff was really apologetic and attempted to accommodate afterwards. I do like the serenity of the cafe at the time I went in this morning."}
{"text":"In a bit of a rush for lunch on my break I ordered a simple order. It took 18 minutes before I asked what happened after observing people getting food that came in after me. It was sitting in the window. They asked if I wanted it to go. I then observed them slowly put in my sandwich which was painful to watch. Without gloves and touching my food bare handed albeit also using tongs they pushed chips on top and closed it. I had enough. I asked for manager and they asked do you want to talk to them? Haha yes please. Explained what happened she said they always use gloves. They didn't this time. Got a refund. No lunch. Should have been handled better in every way"}
{"text":"Love Corner Bakery, always a tasty spot when you find one! Recommend the Rustic Italian Panini. 

Note though seating area is quite sticky as well as pop and condiment area look a bit used and gross."}
{"text":"Just ordered take out pastries but they looked great. I did order a latte and it was EXCELLENT!
Everyone is super nice and the restaurant is all spiffy and new. Hope it stays that way!"}
{"text":"I've seen Corner Bakery Cafe scattered throughout Southern California every time I visit, but I've never actually had the desire to try it, so I thought it was cool that there was a location that would be close to home that would give me that opportunity.

I was on my way to Einstein Bros. to grab a quick bite to eat before work and then I remembered that Corner Bakery Cafe just opened up. Change of plans! I quickly browsed the menu and decided to order the Commuter Croissant. The breakfast sandwich consists of scrambled eggs, smoked bacon, cheddar, and tomatoes on a flaky croissant. I ordered my sandwich with no tomatoes because I simply don't like tomatoes and even if I did, I still wouldn't get them because it just seems like it doesn't belong in a breakfast sandwich, especially on a croissant.

I ordered my breakfast to-go and it came out extremely fast. It was okay, but nothing special that makes me want to go back for more. The scrambled eggs were really wet, the cheese was barely melted, and the bacon wasn't cooked all the way.

Overall, the service was friendly and I think that Corner Bakery Cafe is a great addition to Stephanie St. Like previous Yelpers have said, this place is definitely comparable to Panera Bread and Café Zupas. I'm hoping to give more stars in the future with a dine-in visit during lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a sandwich. It is absolutely spotless, the staff is super friendly and if you go at the right time you might be the only customers there, which is good for me but not for them I am sure. If you haven't been go and try the beef and cheddar sandwich it comes with chips, pickle and a drink you won't regret it.  Whatever you get you must try their baked good.. love the toffee cookie."}
{"text":"First time here & it didn't disappoint! The 4 of us all ordered a different breakfast & we all thought it was delicious. They also have great coffees & smoothies & cinnamon rolls!"}
{"text":"The portions here are better than in California. I've been. Noticing CB cutting back on their portions in Cali, and it's not like we eat any less! Anyways, got the Anaheim Scrambler and Commuter Croissant with a small coffee. Good coffee as always. The Anaheim scrambler was solid, lots of avocado and bacon bits. Commuter croissant had 2 large bacon strips with cheddar cheese, scrambled eggs, and tomatoes in a croissant. Both were great, and he service was excellent. Friendly staff, and they seem to know most guest by name. Great place!"}
{"text":"I came here while getting my car detailed at Danny's and had 2 hours to kill.  I ordered the gobbler sandwich with roast turkey, stuffing and a cranberry relish.  Oh yummy...it's even better than paradise bakery's version.  The vibe is cozy and open and has great wifi.  When the manager heard it was my first time she came over and gave me a delicious pumpkin muffin with glaze.  I'm ready to burst, but really loved relaxing here.  Great place!!"}
{"text":"Perfectly fine chain restaurant to go to. Went here for lunch and it took a really long time for the food to come out. I was also surprised at how small some of the sides are. My advice would be to not come here to get something \"healthy\" - come here for a fast but comforting meal and you'll leave happy because at least after the wait you will have delicious and somewhat indulgent food to make up for it."}
{"text":"Food was great but service was subpar. When I got in, the lady at the counter was busy wrapping cookies (I think). I get it, she has more responsibilities than just manning the register. But her back was turned. There was no one in the restaurant except me and another couple. The kitchen staff saw me but couldn't be bothered to get her attention. After about 5 minutes, I asked,  \"excuse me, are you open?\" And she came to the register like I was inconveniencing her! 

My order did come quickly when I was finally able to order it and the food was good. 

Just a tip, please have your team members communicate with one another. It'd make a much smoother experience for the customer. :)

It was my first time visiting and I really do want to give it another shot because the food was tasty."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been going here for over a year and I have never done a review... Don't know why because this place is great!!! You have a choice of coffees, which I like,  cause i enjoy a robust bold coffee, which they offer. Breakfast has always been hot, ample and delicious. I love their paninis... They will grill on any bread, not just the way the sandwich is posted. Their soups are hot and wonderful, and those salads. .. amazing!!! I have a fetish for lemon bars and what they bake fresh here are sooo yummy, along with the Lemon Pound Cake. .. heaven in a bite!!! Great place to enjoy great food,  in a warm,  inviting atmosphere. .. Go, you'll love it"}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get greeted kindly and feel like I am appreciated. The food is phenomenal and always incredibly fast. I've never had a bad experience here. The managers, particularly Ray and Geoff, always stop by my table a couple times during my visit to make sure I am enjoying my experience and that the food is perfect. I see them doing that for everyone and i think it's a very nice touch. They are both very friendly and make me feel happy to be here. 

I love the variety here! If I want something light, they have this mouth watering breakfast power wrap. If I'm looking for a panini, they have a vast amount of options. Their sourdough bacon and cheddar is my favorite for now. They have too many amazing options that I keep changing my mind. They have the best honey and banana crunch pancakes so make sure you try them at some point as well. If your a pasta person, just keep coming here for their chicken and pesto cavatoppi! It's creamy, flavorful, and is big enough to take the leftovers home for tomorrow."}
{"text":"My family and I went for our first time tonight. The meatball panini was excellent and it has a great atmosphere there. The prices are reasonable and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Love corner bakery. Back home in LA but this one failed to deliver. Took forever to find parking and once I did and placed my order and waited I was called up to say there out of the product. Money back please. Thanks for wasting my time. I don't know how they are out of stuff. There was no customers."}
{"text":"Love this place! I recommend the chopped salad, minus bleu cheese, unless of course you like it. Every time I go the staff  is always very friendly and ask if I need anything at all. Yummy cookies too!"}
{"text":"Did not live up to expectations 

I have eaten at corner bakeries before and they are great.  This one was horrible. We went for breakfast and the food was very cold, the potatoes and scrambled eggs seemed old.  We asked for tobasco sauce and the waitress never came back after she said she would bring some.  The toast was cold and tasted like it was made an hour before we ordered it.  Management needs to do something"}
{"text":"Not the worst place I've ever eaten, but definitely nothing impressive.  The staff has always been pleasant, but the quality of food just seems (and tastes) cheap to me.  I ordered the chicken casear salad on my last visit and was decently priced at around $8.  The chicken seemed cheap and processed and the dressing was just typical caesar dressing.  

Have not tried any of the deserts, but I am in no rush to eat there again."}
{"text":"So I have come to this business on a couple of occasions and wanted to wait until I had a real experience.l and sampled more of the menu before I actually commented. Honestly, the food is great. However, I really wasn't impressed with the service as much. Specifically the cashier. I'm not going to go into too many specifics as I'm not mad or out for blood but I don't like being rushed or having someone tell me a blatant dishonest statement such as the cash register shutting down at 8:00 pm exactly. That's not how the system works because if it did, it would be incapable of reconciling transactions.  Our mistake for coming in a few minutes before closing and the staff wanting to go home but customer service such as making the customer feel welcome should not be to much to ask.

Overall, the food is excellent for what it's worth but it's not going to be the first on my list when I am hungry. I'd still recommend however if you are fine with a 7-11 reminiscent level of service (which to me has been more friendly - even in the bad part of town)"}
{"text":"Your new hours are terrible! Your food is great, but now your never open. What the French Toast"}
{"text":"Very kind and personable service. Extremely kind to my daughter. Deliciously fresh food and beverages."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place-I mean, the idea of a corner bakery conjures up pictures of small town, great yeasty smells and oh-so-tasty food. Unfortunately, it was none of those things. Well, first it's downtown Phoenix so I can forgive the small town thing. But no good yeasty smells and the food was below mediocre. I had the broccoli cheddar soup. The taste was ok but it was so watery. I also had the southwestern chicken salad. Again watery. (Interesting phenomenon for the desert...) and tasteless. So watery that I could not taste the ranch dressing that was supposed to be on it and had to get some more and it STILL was watery. Watery and pretty tasteless.  All in all very disappointing.  Will I eat there again? Nope.  Too bad-it's a great location for ASU students and others strolling around downtown but I can't imagine that they'll stay in business for much longer with less than mediocre food like this. Going back to Paradise Bakery for the broccoli cheddar soup-now that is rich and creamy!"}
{"text":"First time here at this location and as soon as I walked in we felt welcomed. The staff is extremely friendly and they all greet you. The food is delicious. I'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"The name says it all, and it does not disappoint. I have come here a few times for a light breakfast after hiking A mountain across the street. During the week there a more people posted at tables who look like they are working, so they probably have wifi available. I tried their coffee and I believe it's the hazelnut blend, but I was so impressed at the flavor! So much better than Starbucks! I drink my coffee black, but they have all the condiments--creamer, milk, honey, cinnamon if you want to add flavors. Prices are reasonable and the food is good, service is quick and friendly. You order at the front take a number, and then seat yourself. Food comes to your table quickly! Overall it's a great little cafe."}
{"text":"I work very close and often come for breakfast and lunch, The food has always been good and I love that they have gluten free options. It can be pricey if you do choose the gluten free bread though ($2).  I'd rather not spend $10 a day for lunch.  

The wait service is pretty attentive and I can tell they are trying to make a good impression."}
{"text":"I wish I had one near my house!  Very clean and fresh selections.  Quick and easy counter service delivered to table.  Many non sugar beverage options which is a rare find.  I had the chicken Pesto on a baguette.  It was big enough for two. They offer a pick three salad feature that I regretfully did not order.  There was also a huge mac n cheese with bacon entree that seemed very decadent from afar.  Service was very friendly and even said goodbye."}
{"text":"This place has only been open for a few days and we tried it out. I loved their chocolate bundt cake but did not care for their roast beef or their trio salad. Their water and pickles were their best things. A waitress was giving samples of their oatmeal but when she gave me a spoon for it. She placed her bandaided thumb right in the spot of the spoon that goes into your mouth. I understand it will take some time for the employees to learn their jobs but I doubt that this place will be much if a hit.  good luck corner bakery!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Corner Bakery in 8 years, as I moved out of California into AZ and they have Kneaders.  Now I'm  in Henderson, NV and was so excited to see one but that soon turned to sh#t and something has turned the corner at Corner Bakery:  portions!!

 I ordered the cup of soup and 2 salads...omg, it was pathetic and sad.  THE soup was ok but it was so small, 2 salads, (a chicken salad made like no way I have ever seen before, a \"torn\" chicken salad?)...only 2 tablespoons of it, the other salad was 2 tablespoons of curley pasta, with some green leaves, from the \"garden of hell\" as a decoration.    These \"little guy,\" child size,  salads....were sitting very sad and pissed off because the plate was gigantic, a white porcelain the size of a beach ball, porcelain was all over the place with tiny, little, \"snibbles\" of food for $8.99...And there were 10 employees in the back looking at me...10 employees and that's the scraps you give customers???  

 The baguette was miniscule...aren't you a bakery???? Fire them all, you could save $50 an hour and give more food...holy smokes, people!!!

NEWS FLASH!!  You are sitting in the shadow of a casino and a  $8.99 luncheon buffet at Sunset Station!!! 

 WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU CHARGING FOR??? A SAMPLE OF FOOD???   I returned that insulting, piss/poor, excuse for a meal and got my money back..."}
{"text":"Website indicates breakfast scrambles can be gf. Despite saying I'm gf so no toast just potatoes and fruit. They bring toast with my meal (touching my food) and cold potatoes. It goes on. I won't be back.
Before we left they did come and apologize and gave us $10 in coupons."}
{"text":"The morning and afternoon staff at Corner Bakery are extremely friendly and very upbeat. I had a ton of coupons I had to use before they expired so I was coming in for breakfast and lunch as the coupons made my wallet happy. Their oatmeal is hearty and their power flats are tiny ( but very good as I got to try all of them). Now their salads are good but they can be hit or miss depending on who is making them that day? I know it sounds strange but for some reason their spinach salad with chicken would be nice and hearty one day and skimpy the next time I ordered. Same for the harvest salad. It was the weirdest thing. Don't get me wrong, they were both good but I on the skimpier days I felt like I got robbed of some good eats lol. 

At any rate coupon or not, the food is good, the location is great, and the staff are wonderful. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"My sister had the harvest salad and it was great and my wife had the chicken noodle soup but she thought it was kind of salty.

I had the BLT and it was pretty good. :-)"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Different coffee and teas to choose from and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Solid.  Tasty.  Fast.  Filling.  Clean.  Friendly.  Ample parking. Comfortable.  

Received a complimentary meal at their new location.  So glad I was able to attend and check it out.  The owner was very friendly and knows his stuff.  Staff were great - still getting their sea legs but handled a large crowd quite well. 

Had the pasta carbonara - solid.  Could had had a little more sauce but the flavors were spot on.  A LARGE serving - enough to take home.  My entree came with a Caesar salad side.   One of the best I've had.  The deserts were fabulous!  LOVED the cheesecake. 

Can't wait to go back and try the lemon bar.  It was calling my name from the case.  Had a small M&M cookie too..  Yum!  

And... They have Diet Dr Pepper! Score!!!  

I will go back without question.  You should too!

Now off to walk around the neighborhood so I can go back next time without guilt!  Have my eye on the Asian pork sandwich... It looked awesome!"}
{"text":"This downtown location in Phoenix should be avoided. I have frequented this restaurant brand frequently in Chicago so I assumed the product would be commensurate. Upon entry the smell was rancid, like trash cooking in the sun. Tables, floors, and seats needed a good elbow grease scrubbing. Service was acceptable, however. Bakeries should smell like delicious food and the place should be spotless. Even in Chicago, it isn't always perfect but it apparently is markedly better than this location."}
{"text":"This is a new bakery & restaurant located in Tucson on 203 S. Wilmot Rd.  Across the street from Texas Roadhouse. The have the most awesome pancakes 
!!!  They make their own maple/vanilla syrup from scratch. The Bacon Cheddar Panini is just perfect for a smaller appetite, tasty too! We also had the Anaheim Scrambler which was an exceptional meal, Great tasting and filling. The cinnamon roll was delicious and the cinnamon cream cake was very moist and not too extremely sweet. Overall planning to return very soon to try more options on the large menu they have"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in Henderson. Their servings are large, but they're delicious. The paninis are to die for. There is no bad choice. GET THE LEMONADE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The poor customer service I had received was unbelievable. I placed my bakery order that consisted of a bagel, muffin & cookie to go with the sales associate at the  register. After paying he handed me my receipt and proceeded to ring up the next customer. I thought maybe my order was coming directly from the kitchen rather than the display up front. Finally after waiting several minutes and noting that he was just sauntering around completely ignoring me and my order, I mentioned to the female employee that I was waiting for my bakery order. She shook her head and spoke to the employee in Spanish who acted clueless. She then filled my order. I have never received such poor service; and needless to say, will never return nor recommend this cafe to anyone."}
{"text":"This place was very conveniently located across from the Sheraton Hotel. The menu items were very nice and refreshing. The staff had great customer service and made a very good first impressions as well did the food. The chicken tortilla soup was amazing and I really enjoyed the avocado salad and the mozzarella vegetarian sandwich. I think they could do better with the drink variety I was looking for some mineral water or something more healthier other than water to drink and there were limited options."}
{"text":"The food was not good. The booths and tables were not clean. (We went at 6am.) The staff was not friendly and they were sitting down eating breakfast and drinking their iced coffee like it was a social club not work."}
{"text":"I have a bad feeling about the longevity of this one. I went in wanting to be impressed.It looks super cute and just my style from the outside ..how can you go wrong with the word Bakery in the title? But  after eating there I can say the food was just meh... my kids both commented it was just okay  and they even  had some of the baked goods. 
The decor is  part bistro/ part old time feel .. looks cute with baked goods in covered glass tiers on the counter.  The service is just like Paradise or Wildflower Bread ..but the food is not as good or creative in my book. 
My chopped salad was chopped so small that I couldn't quite eat  it and wished I had a spoon.  Flavor in the salad was uninspired and got old quick . 
As my oldest said \" I can't quite see us going back\"."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab a sandwich at a reasonable price. I've been here a few times and I have to say that the Turkey sandwich with bacon, tomatoes, lettuce and avocados is my favorite. They give you a bag of chips with that sandwich. My wife and I spent a little under $18 for our sandwiches and my soda. There's plenty of seating and elbow room at this place. All the employees are helpful and they quickly bus your table when you're done with your meal. They also have plenty of outdoor seating. I'm guessing this place is mobbed during lunch time but it is not crowded during the dinner hours when I have visited."}
{"text":"The Corner Bakery Cafe is a welcomed addition to the Camelback corridor. A great place if you want a sandwich, panini or some soup or salad. 

I ordered the Club Panini which is served with chips and a pickle. The panini consists of smoked turkey breast, smoked bacon, white cheddar cheese and plum tomatoes with a touch of mayo. I washed it down with some diet Dr. Pepper out on their patio. It was a very relaxing lunch so that I could recharge my batteries to get through the rest of the work day. I couldn't believe that this place wasn't packed on a Thursday afternoon. But maybe the word hasn't got out yet. Perhaps I shouldn't even write this review because I want this chill place all to myself.

Fortunately you don't have a walk the miracle mile to get to this place. It's easier if you access this place from Highland instead of Camelback Road, much less traffic."}
{"text":"Just tried to go in there. It's 4:55pm and the doors are locked. None of the 4 employees I saw acknowledged my presence. There was no sign saying they had different hours. The hours are displayed and say 8am to 6pm on Saturday and Sunday."}
{"text":"Everything in here looks fresh and the salads have never disappointed me! Although the Reuben looks amazing I stuck with the Asian salad that is delicious with fresh dressing and moist chicken.  They top the salad with a mini salad of edamame, diced cucumbers, cabbage and carrots with a vinegar or pickled dressing that is to-die-for."}
{"text":"I struggle with this place so much.  Several times I've stopped by for something to eat and they would be closed during advertised hours, staff meeting or something else going on.  Well I got in last night and had a cup of chili and a cookie for a snack on my way to an appointment.  The staff was incredible in a good way, very happy and professional.  I was impressed.  The food, not so much.  The cookie looked over cooked and was okay, the chocolate was pretty gooey, even though the cookie didn't see so fresh.  Typically chili is more expensive than soup, which was true here and I wasn't so impressed.  It was too hot so I burned the roof of my mouth and it seemed to lack flavor.  I'd go if a friend suggested it, but I wouldn't be the one making the suggestion."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much more.  It's decent - it just didn't wow me like I really thought it would.  
We came here for an early dinner last night and the restaurant itself is clean and inviting.  There are booths and tables throughout for plentiful seating.  The menu is large and clear and there are lots of options - both with the food itself and various mixing and matching of items to create the meal you want.  They have a bakery display case with some really delicious looking sweets -I wish I had more room after dinner to try something.  
I ordered a chicken pomodori panini along with a caesar side salad.  The sandwich was good - super fresh and obviously made to order.  The salad, however, was pretty underwhelming.  It was earlier than normal dinner hours so I have to assume that it may have been lunch leftovers?  The lettuce was a bit wilted, the croutons a bit soggy and the dressing was almost non-existent.  I have a strong feeling that if it were more fresh, it would probably be really good.  Unfortunately, I guess my timing was off to get a fresh one.  
My husband got the same sandwich as me but opted for a pasta side.  He enjoyed his meal but beware of the garlic in the pasta!  Do they have a vampire problem they're trying to get rid of or what?  Whew!  I mean - I love garlic.  Like love, love, love it but no kidding - we counted SIX whole garlic cloves in this one little mini bowl of pasta.  I was scared to kiss my own husband after that!  :) 
They have a fountain drink area along with some tea options in coolers.  There's also an area with lots of condiments - mayo, dijon mustard, salt, pepper, etc., etc.  It's nice to be able to help yourself to that type of stuff rather than bug somone for it, you know?  
The restaurant staff was kind and helpful.  After letting the young man who was taking our order know that it was our first time there, he explained some of the menu options and answered all our questions.  The food came out to us within 5-10 minutes and like I said, this is fresh fast food.  
I'll give Corner Bakery another shot to impress me cause I was definitely digging the fresh food, clean dining area and the cool employees.  Hopefully I'll come back at ya with an updated and better rated review."}
{"text":"I am backlogged on review writing so many will be out of order. I have been to Phoenix 3x's this year already and will be going another 2 times before years end. 

This past April, when I was in town I met my mom and an old co-worker of hers that I hadn't seen since my baby shower almost 17 years ago now. I had never been to a CB before and since Wildflower hadn't opened yet and Paradise (aka-more options Panera) had already been tried, I was excited to see what this place was about.

Like Panera, it is an order at the counter and they bring you your food. They have tons of options for breakfast, lunches and dinners from sandwiches, baked goods and salads. Since I arrived late my mom and her friend Bev were already mid-way through their lunches (this wasn't a planned meeting). I ordered the smaller portion of the Asian Edamame salad adding avocado and water. The young man taking my order was seriously one of the sweetest \"kids\" I have encountered in a very long time. He explained menu options, we talked about how hard it was working so close to Sun City dealing with all the personality types and so on. They do not have tip jars but he was so sweet that I inquired if they were allowed to take tips. He looked at me as if I was speaking a foreign language. I tipped him and he came from around the corner and gave me a hug. 

I joined my mom and Bev at the table and the \"kid\" brought me a piece of cake (not ordered) along with my salad. So sweet. My salad was pretty tasty-the dressing was a bit spicy but tolerable and I liked the food options much better than expected. 

When we were all done, I gave Bev a hug, and told my mom I was going to get more water to go. The \"kid\" was on his break having lunch with his GF who then introduced me to her and gave me yet another hug to say thank you. I have never been thanked so much for a $5.00 tip-and it just went to show me how much a little niceness and appreciation can mean to another person. 

Since this time a I noticed a CB opened locally (review to come) and definitely would go to this location again when in town (after I fulfill my Wildflower Bread Company craving)."}
{"text":"This place is good! Its set up like Panera - order at the counter and seat yourself. The food is fresh - we ordered omlettes with avocado and fruit salad. Everything tasted freshly made - excellent! The restaurant was clean and staff friendly."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to check out the Corner Bakery for a while and finally had the opportunity to last week. For four adults, we paid just over $40.00 for meals/drinks, which seemed a bit pricey, but I suppose everything is nowdays.

I had the Chicken Tortilla soup, Uptown Turkey sandwich and a mixed green side salad in the form of the sandwich/soup combo with a side salad. The hubs had the Bavarian Ham sandwich; my Daddy-O had the same but with a cup of lentil soup and Mama had the Uptown turkey sandwich and cup of Cream of Broccoli soup. We all were really impressed with how fresh and delicious our meals were. Man, that Chicken Tortilla soup is SO delicious! (but I am a self proclaimed soup lover so no surprise there) 

We arrived around 1pm so they were busy with the lunch crowd and the tables weren't cleaned as quickly as they could have been. (I had to mention to the gal at the cash register that there were no clean tables) But they had three guys come out and clean up the handful of dirty tables INSTANTLY. And the manager even came up to me and apoligized; which was unnecessary but refreshing. 

If you haven't tried this place out, I would highly suggest you give it a try for yourself. I'd venture to say you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my husband and loved it. 

Mac and cheese with chicken and bacon...can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"This great little spot just opened yesterday so a few friends and I decided to give it a try. Bright, well decorated and very comfortable. The menu is on a board and easy to read.  Lots of salads, sandwiches pastas and baked goods. Ohhh the baked goods.  While we were eating, one of the staff passed around little squares of their poundcake. I could have made an entire meal out of their poundcake. Absolutely the best I've ever had.
I wish I had been more creative, and if I have thought about it I would have ordered something with more imagination but I did order a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese on a sesame bun along with a cup of tomato basil soup. It was absolutely delicious, fresh bun and the beef tender and very flavorful.  The  tomato soup also tasted like it had just been made fresh and had great flavor. My friends ordered salads and soups and said they were excellent.
Service here is outstanding -they can't seem to do enough for you.
By the time we were leaving every seat has been taken so this place may just be a winner and we will return.
Oh and be sure to pick up a package of their raisin pecan crisps.  So good. Have one for breakfast instead of toast."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday because everywhere else was busy. Now I know why this place wasn't. Good was not disgusting but it was not that good. Ordered the anaheim scramble and my boyfriend ordered a panini. Both were flavorless and room temperature. The toast was good but not warm so the butter never melted. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite hang out in the mornings for my coffee. The staff was so nice and friendly. This place is CLOSED permanently. Once they start closing at 3 PM and on weekends it was the nail in the coffin."}
{"text":"new cafe in town and I prefer it better than Panera. fast service  and friendly staff. order your food at the counter and they serve to your table. Salads, Sandwiches, Panini. pasta bowls and of course yummy desserts. (have to try them next time)"}
{"text":"Yes I really can't say enough good things about this place if you are only looking for amazing pastries muffins and some naughty dessert. I'm not too crazy about the egg dishes as it taste like they use egg product? But that's not really their specialty anyway so if you want something like that go to Eggstacy or good egg.  Excellent customer service all the employees are very nice and friendly the manager is awesome! I was really craving their banana cream pie which is really one of the best in the valley and I'm super picky about my BCP! But they were all out so I had to go with the French silk which was fabulous but I wanted a little whipped cream on the top I asked them could do that and the manager said sure it was divine!!! Also the coffee and cappuccinos are quite good. Raspberry crumble bar very good too. I don't know about the other locations but this is nearest to me and I have to say the staff is truly excellent:)"}
{"text":"UPSIDES: 
Good location, cute decor, soft jazz music, friendly service, wifi, really yummy cheddar broccoli soup (only served Sun. thru Tues.), a good cup of Chai tea for only $2.50

DOWNSIDES:
Small portions, by the time you order enough food it gets pricey, could get really crowded if you're there at the wrong time, just okay egg salad, which is made entirely of eggs and not with lettuce like I was thinking, the cute Italian breadsticks are flavorless (have they not heard of garlic?)"}
{"text":"If you've never been to this location before, the parking is off of Filmore. Found that out after circling the Arizona Center. Be sure to have your ticket validated because if you don't, you will pay a whopping $12 for parking/hr! The validation machine is just outside the doors of the parking structure and you must get a SECOND ticket from your vendor that proves your validation. 

As for the Corner Bakery, this location doesn't hop like the one on Bell Rd. So the staff is relaxed. Maybe a little too relaxed ... because the cashier didn't hear me say \"tortilla\" so I got chicken noodle soup served to me instead. The truffle hot chocolate tasted like ordinary hot cocoa. However, their uptown turkey pannini was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is a better Panera Bread/Jason's Deli.

The inside is very clean and there are wall and usb plugs at a lot  of the tables.

The food felt less \"chain restaurant\" and more homemade. I've tried a little bit of everything. The chili is amazing. The soups are very hearty. The breakfast is perfect portion size and a very fair price. 

I'd give their customer service a strong 5/5.

Just as I was losing hope in the declining quality of chain business casual restaurants, this place opened and saved the day."}
{"text":"Very tasty sandwich and chili. Very friendly staff. Good bakery but somewhat limited selection of baked goods - bread, cookies, cake."}
{"text":"I loved this place! It was so clean and the staff was so friendly. I tried the Anaheim Scrambler with a side order of bacon and it was delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and enjoyable lunch. I had the two salads and the flat bread. The BBQ pork was absolutely delicious. Very different take on the avocado salad and truly enjoyed the tuna salad as well. Great value for the money."}
{"text":"A good choice

The Corner Bakery is located directly across from the Sheraton Phoenix Downtown hotel which makes The Corner Bakery convenient for grabbing breakfast or lunch.  As you entet the cafe you place your order at the counter, given a number, and your meal is brought to your table.

The Corner Bakery offers Breafast, Sandwiches,  Paninis, and seeet treats. Today, I visited for lunch with a co-worker and ordered off the breakfast menu. My entree wasn't bad, the typical breakfast fare. The price wasn't bad with tax a little under $8. I think the next time I visit I will try a sandwich or soup. The Corner Bakery is a good choice to get a variety of"}
{"text":"Hard to find a good Cuban sandwich and this was good, not great,  but good. Quiet space to get some computer work done too though."}
{"text":"I was here today and apparently one should not come after the lunch rush.    I ordered soup and half sandwich...first the order was wrong...then the food was slow in coming. Soup was cold...had to send it back.  My lunch date ordered chilli and it was 20 minutes before they told her there was none.  It was another 15 minutes before she got a replacement.  The chicken noodle soup is no better than progressive soup.   Certainly this meal was bnot worth the 11.95 i had to pay."}
{"text":"Upscale paradise bakery that has gluten-free options and a killer black currant ice tea. They also provide free wifi and a great area to plugin and work on my computer for a couple hours."}
{"text":"we went here for their grand opening and we were impressed. we were meeting some friends so we decided to drive up from chandler. the food took 30 minutes to be served. the eggs, bacon, and toast were all cold. there were no condiments. my husband went into the bathroom after we ate and there was poop on the toilet seat and walls! we will never go here again!"}
{"text":"After a night of drunken partying, my friend Taric and I had a long, hot, walk home. And we saw this place so decided to walk in. 

Before even hitting the door, I noticed an older couple leaving. They saw us, Urban people, and stared a little longer than my comfort level normally allows. I rolled my eyes as we entered.

First thing was a nice blast of cold air. I liked that. The atmosphere was exactly what you would expect of a bakery cafe. Dark stained wood. No ceiling. And some upbeat trumpet based jazz playing, the volume turned up higher than normal. 

The line was slightly long, but fast moving. When you first come in, there is a paper menu on the table, and unless you have great vision, with a hint of magnification attributes, I suggest you grab one. 

Apparently, all their food is homegrown. Which gave me hope for a more delicious meal. But of course, this also drives the prices a little higher. When we got to the cashier, I ordered the Anaheim Scrambler. Which is described as scrambled eggs with bacon, cheese, tomato, and topped with avocado pieces. I got a large pre-made/homemade lemonade. Overall $10.00

Taric got his food first after we sat down, and it took him eating a whole half a sandwich before I got my food... My plate certainly looked impressive. A standard helping of eggs. I cup of assorted fresh looking fruit. And two half slices of their own wheat bread. The eggs were fantastic, in my opinion. They were cooked perfectly. And the bacon and cheese was delicious as well. However the best part was the avocado! It enhanced the meal perfectly. The fruit was fresh. The lemonade good. The bread was a little dry, which was disappointing considering this was a bakery, and I expected fresh bread.

In the end, I was satisfied. The price matched the quality. Next time, during the colder seasons, I want to try their coffee. And their black tea, which according to Taric is the best black tea of all time!?!?!?!"}
{"text":"What a shame. I interviewed Tim with over a year ago after 
speaking with his brother a few days before. I have
strong management skills and owned and operated
2 cafe's and bakery cafe's and I have to say, I saw
this coming.
Some folks would rather fail than to embrace the
opportunities to bring on idea's, energy and
professionalism which allow for consistently 
and excellence in their operations. Tim was
a bit arrogant to pass on me and others and 
the result is they lost millions of dollars and
so much sacrifice and time. Wildflower works
daily to ensure excellence, now Panera is
everywhere and the former leader in sales
revenue and growth Corner Bakery has all
but been extinguished. 
I feel bad for everyone, I know this is a
very tough business, I could have helped
in a big way."}
{"text":"Nice selection of food. Staff friendly. Food came out pretty quickly. Some of the tables are empty but haven't been cleaned off. My tomato soup was more chunky and a tad sweet for my taste, seriously reminded my of marinara sauce. It almost made me want to ask for a small serving of plain noodles so I can have a nice Italian meal. The California panini was pretty good. Their lemon hand pie was a sad disappointment (see pictures). The blueberry version made up for it, tho. All in all, might stop by again if in the neighborhood but will be sure to get anything other than that lemon pie."}
{"text":"We grabbed lunch here the other day. It was my first visit and frankly I was unimpressed. I didn't dislike it, but nothing here made me want to return. Perhaps I'll give it another try again someday in the future."}
{"text":"Sigh, I eating a meal and then thinking to myself why do I have to pay for this crap. I could've done it better in my own kitchen. I had a 1/2 Chicken Pomodori Panini with a side salad, a tea, and a pecan cinnamon rugelach. Sandwich had roasted chicken that was rubbery and the bread didn't taste like anything. Side salad, tomatoes way too ripe, should have been thrown out not served and croutons were soggy. The tea was thick tasting, like there was too much tea and not enough water. The rugelach was actually decent, crispy and sweet. And it's a BIG downer when you see an employee walk over to the food station, grab a pickle with his bare hands and start crunching away on it. This place was an overall disappointment. I have eaten here before, so I should have known better."}
{"text":"Kitchen has serious issues.  25 minutes to get the order and they aren't busy.  First delivery sandwich was wrong, one small slice of chicken and cold (panini)  Salad was small lacking croutons.  Second delivery the sandwich was right and loaded with chicken and hot.  The salad was twice as big and right.  It's simple.  Just prepare the food right the first time.  Situations like this show you are striving to provide average at best service & kitchen work the first time.  My second delivery is what I should've received in the first place.  We'll see next time."}
{"text":"if i could give zero stars i would. microwaved food with bland to no flavor.
bad customer service!
dont go here ever!"}
{"text":"Have ordered from them numerous times for catering.  Have spent tons of money with them and this last order was HORRIBLE.  Will NEVER go back.  Was called when the order should have been delivered stating they are running late.  They didn't come until after 30 MINUTES from their promised delivery time.  Representative was rude, was told I was going to receive $10.00 off because of their service but of course did not happen.  Waiting for a manager or corporate rep to contact me now.  We will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER order from them again.  They lost some great business from my company!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the atmosphere here at Corner Bakery Cafe. I've been waiting impatiently for it to open and now that it's here, I could not be happier! The employees are so friendly and helped me to find a spot near an outlet and to pick the most delicious coffee. Smiling faces all around, I hope they stay!!

The only reason I docked a star was because they ran out of bread bowls by the time I got there :( And the bread in my salad was pretty salty.

Other than that, I would suggest the Spinach Sweet Crisp Salad! Perfect blend of foods."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and not good, I decided to give it a try. And I got the harvest scrambler with fruit and oatmeal. The eggs were watery with no flavor, the fruit was not good (old). The oatmeal was very overdone. Definitely don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a fantastic stop this was! I love the location. Well except for the parking meters. However, I ordered the Farmers Scramble and it was delicious. Sitting outside on the Patio that faces Mill Avenue is right in my wheelhouse. I enjoy looking at the mountains, the old grain mill and both the bridge and Zenefits building up the road.

There are many egg infused options for breakfast, as well as healthier options like oatmeal. My experience with the service was awesome and they took care of all of my wants and needs expeditiously. The inside is immaculate and very upscale in the vibe of the joint. It is truly a great area as you are surrounded by local shops, bars, boating and beautiful walking paths along the waterfront to get that bacon burning.

This is college town, so it's loaded with a Ton-O-Eye Candy and hard bodies but who's looking. Right? I would come back here in 2 shakes of a lambs tail; maybe even one. Key points, great facility, good location, good food and candy for dessert! #vino2 #Vinosquared #vino2ultimate #irishcatv2"}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant. A nice spot for breakfast or lunch in the middle of the Aizona Center. Ample seating, large and tasty portions served by a happy staff."}
{"text":"There was construction going on around the restaurant, so it took some going around to get to the front door. I asked for the Anaheim scrambler without onions & wanted fruit instead of the potatoes. I received an Anaheim Panini and was charged extra for some fruit. It tasted good, but different from what I ordered. My friend ordered a Chai tea but ended up getting some coffee version of Chai, so he got that corrected. They weren't too busy but were not really listening when we ordered. We also bought a sweet pound cake as a gift for friends. All tasted good."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix we went downtown to ice skate and have lunch. The Corner was busy however 25 minutes for a sandwich and salad is too long. The food quality was fine but the service was below average"}
{"text":"We were in downtown Phoenix as a 1 time thing and needed to kill time. We only stopped in here because Starbucks was across the courtyard.  It was okay. I had a panning and it rated fine.. nothing special to Get my attention and say Wow!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and the manager gave me a free bowl of mac n cheese when I said mentioned that it looked good."}
{"text":"Cute cafe style eatery with vegan options. Portion sizes were just right. Had the oatmeal, delicious. Met friends do breakfast and sat outside. Very comfortable ."}
{"text":"the setting is nice and clean. very airy and plenty of spaces to sit. you order at the counter, take a number, then they bring the food to you. we didn't have to wait long for our meals to arrive. 
i ordered the cavatappi with marinara. noodles with marinara. the portion was large and smothered in a nice acidic tomato sauce. it was seasoned well and would have done well with a large spoon instead of a fork. i guess that's to slow you down so you don't eat too fast!!!
my wife had a tomato mozzarella on ciabatta. the item stated it came with roasted red peppers. the roasted red peppers were absent on her sandwich. ever since we witnessed a customer (at a different establishment) essentially have a whole meal returned to the kitchen, we thought we would start requesting that as well....we are diners whom are too polite and usually wind up eating sub par food without complaining. 

so not this time! the manager came out and he asked how the meal was. we said good, except that the sandwich is missing a key ingredient...the peppers! his reply was \"oh i'm so sorry about that. i hope you come back because that won't happen again\" and then moved on to the next table. whatever man...who says speaking up for getting dissed on a meal never met our food people. 

anyway, that's that. it's too far for us to go back for a gamble of a meal. we have our own fav's down here."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow. When I was about to order oatmeal (my favorite item here), a worker behind the cashier said not to sell the oatmeal because it was too salty. When we sat down to wait for our food, other groups were brought oatmeal.
I found something different to order but my latte was very bland and it seemed they forgot to put the flavoring in it.
The coffee station did not have the bold flavor available for 30 min.
After 25 min, I went up to the counter and asked whether our numbers were ready, they said that they were still making them. Although it was only scrambled eggs and a few pieces of bacon.  
Still 30 minutes later, food has not arrived... which prompted me to start writing this review.
The corner bakery in Hinsdale Illinois, which I have been to in the past, has never treated customers like this.
We ended up going to the counter to get a refund and cancel our orders. Another worker apologized and said they are usually understaffed. She gave us a full refund and offered us some fruit to go. #paneraitis"}
{"text":"Javon was such a pleasure! He made us feel very welcome and was so helpful all while smiling! Such a great personality! Our food was also amazing, we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Sheraton for three nights right across the street from the Arizona center, while attending a business conference. 

We arrived in Phoenix after a 4 hour drive from the Grand Canyon, and fighting through rush hour traffic to get to our hotel, and were hungry and wanted something fast and filling to eat. Walked across the street, and entered the mall, and there was the Corner Bakery Cafe.

The place looked clean, was relatively quiet, and not too busy, so in we went. I ordered the $8 linguine with meatballs special, while my wife ordered the $8.50 Asian wonton salad.

The linguine was actually thick egg noodles, with marinara sauce, and two huge meatballs. The meatballs were the size of billiard balls, if not tennis balls. I kid you not -these were the biggest meatballs I have ever seen!. Unfortunately I was so hungry I ate a huge portion of the dish before I could take a picture of it.

The wonton salad came in a huge bowl, and could have fed four people. It had crispy wontons in a soy dressing, with good portions of chicken and other vegetables mixed in with the salad. 

Total for the meal was $16.48 before tip and tax. 

We came back for two breakfasts. I had the $7 Anaheim scrambler for one meal, which was scrambled eggs with bacon, tomatoes, onion, cheese, and avocado. 

The next day I had the $7 all American scrambler of scrambled eggs with sausage, toast, and potatoes. 

My wife had the $4.30 oatmeal for one meal, and the $5.78 Anaheim Panini, with eggs, bacon, green onions, avocado, and cheese on a sourdough, with a side of fruit medley. 

We will be back to the Corner Bakery Cafe when we come back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"We received a few promotional cards at my office for their 'practice day' and chose the one for dinner!  This was the weekend before their official grand opening.  The California grilled panini was delicious and their spinach salad with fruit and cheese was very good!   My husband loved the chicken panini and the chopped salad.   We had fruit pies (blueberry and lemon) for dessert and coffee was also on the house.  While it was wonderful to eat for free, we loved the food and the excellent, friendly and attentive service from all the staff.   We plan to return and hope they continue to make it very inviting!  Hope they keep up the good work--very pleased!!! :-)"}
{"text":"This place was exactly as promised - clean, quick service, decent selection for breakfast. Chilled oats and cinnamon rolls were a hit with our group."}
{"text":"I got the bacon flat and they put a great amount of bacon on it and it came out quickly. Good service and convenient location."}
{"text":"I feel like this is the perfect place to have lunch with a friend and catch up! Very intimate and cozy feel! I really enjoy there salads and options choose two items and mix it up!"}
{"text":"Cute place 
Great friendly staff
Amazing potatoes 
Only complaint is food was a little cold when it came out"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place when it first opened up! I used to go to Corner Bakery in the Midwest, so I was glad to hear when they were opening one in Scottsdale!
The restaurant was pretty clean, easy to find with good parking. There is a good variety on the menu, with gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan options. I decided to go for the trio with a mixed green salad, hummus and vegetables, and a cup of black bean sriracha soup. The hummus and vegetables came with bread so I asked if instead of bread I could just get some more vegetables. Cashier said no problem, but my plate still came out with bread on it. I just gave it to someone else so it wasn't a big deal. Also I wanted fruit, but no pineapple, but the pineapple was mixed I so I got something else. The hummus was pretty tasty, good consistency, I liked it! I took the croutons off the salad because I did not know it came with croutons. The salad was drenched in dressing. So much so that I couldn't even eat it, it was disgusting. I definitely recommend getting it on the side. The black bean soup was the winner! So so good. Very flavorful which is important because sometimes black bean soup can end up too bland, but I loved this one. Everyone else liked their food too.
I'd come back here again for the soup! And I'd be willing to try something else off the menu too. The desserts looked really good."}
{"text":"Well, the service has really gone downhill. The workers have no pride in their work or understanding of the menu. The cook gave attitude when asked about a forgotten order. The tables always seem to never be bussed which leaves you sitting at a dirty table until they bring you your food..."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time for breakfast. 

The staff was friendly and enthusiastic. There was plenty of seating despite the large number of people eating. The manager, Diana, came around to tables to check on the satisfaction of the the customers. Which we thought was a great idea.

We did explain to her that our potatoes were cold. Not really complaining, just providing her some feedback. She offered us a fresh portion, which we declined because we were full. .She did bring my wife a cookie to compensate!

This is not the least expensive place in town, but the food is good. You can order ahead and pick up at the drive thru which is nice!

Overall a nice experience and we plan to return!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast last Saturday, but I didn't know that it wasn't open to the public. It was what is known as a \"play date\" (practice for invited guests). When I got to the door, there was people milling about the entrance and I didn't see the signs that read, \"closed, invited guests only\". Well, I walked in and there was a bunch of staff members in black tee shirts having breakfast and others in the dining room. I selected the breakfast I wanted and ordered at the counter. When I tried to pay, the girl said \"we are not  taking money, today is a practice day\". I was like \"ooops\" I didn't know.
The cool thing was they let me have breakfast at no charge, so happy day for me.
My breakfast was served in just a few minutes and it was very good. The best part was the pancakes, which were very light and airy. They reminded me of the now defunct Country Kitchen restaurants that served the best pancakes in town. The \"Corner Cafe\" version is exactly the same, pancakes cooked at low heat so that when the syrup is poured on it absorbs into it and not like other places where they have a tough outer crust which makes for a poor breakfast experience. The scrambled eggs and bacon was good too. Excellent service, although the paper sleeve that held the silverware was missing my fork and just had a knife in it. 
Then menu is extensive and there are many choices for lunch and dinner. 
Well even though I was a party crasher and ate for free that day, I will be back for sure because the food and service was great.
I don't know what is going on at Stephanie street in Henderson, but it is turning into restaurant and junk food rowe of the southeast!
Restaurant will see some competition here, but \"Corner Bakery Cafe\" should have no trouble from what I've experienced."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere clean generous cashier and server prices affordable not too outrageous service is a descent amount of time. I would come back."}
{"text":"Good food,  fast service.   The staff is always very friendly.   
Great place for breakfast,  lunch or dinner.   Enjoy a meal here before or after a movie,  theater is next door down."}
{"text":"I went today and I don't know the three star review was too harsh definitely is enough for probably 3 1/2 is more accurate

A positive was the flavor of my sandwich I got the chicken pesto which came are nice baguette and the chicken was good quality with arugula however I'm never really actually tasted pesto. It came with a prepackaged Branded potato chips and it had a couple other options as well and for the price the value is OK

I also tried a cookie their toffee one and it was ok, not the greatest thing ever and it's not gonna make me rush back to try some of the other desserts

The menu just seems to be lacking that something I know they have soups and salads and breakfast and the sandwiches they have about 7 option maybe I was just looking for more than one beef option and they have some More creativity/variety/flavor options. I guess maybe I'm just being too harsh but I would go back but I'm not going to rush to go back"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times.  The bacon mac & cheese is really good and the larger size is enough for a dinner, even had leftovers.  Really we just come here when we want the bacon mac & cheese so have not tried much else.  It is not dry like some places.  My son had a tuna sandwich, I tried it and it was ok, same as pretty much every other place.  We bought three different types of cookies this trip and they were pretty good.  I also purchased a maple bar.  It was pretty good as well and I will probably order another one next time.  Their brownies don't look too great but I have not tried them.  Also purchased a blueberry thing in the past that wasn't impressive.  If you like bacon & mac & cheese you should stop in.  For two of the large bacon mac & cheese, the tuna sand, 3 cookies & the maple bar it came to $36.00.  Not bad and we have leftovers."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Corner Bakery Cafe.  I ordered a spinach salad and tea and both were delicious.  The atmosphere and decor is bright, charming and very welcoming.  My interaction with the staff was friendly and a lobby person picked up my plate when I was finished.

I hope I have the opportunity to visit this place many more times in the future."}
{"text":"Decent food but terrible service. There aren't any other \"fast food\" restaurants in the AZ Center so that's the only reason this place is still open. I work closeby and come here occasionally for a quick meal.  

I had an awful experience recently!! I waited 35 minutes for my order of a breakfast sandwich, a croissant and two sides of bacon. (What can I say, I really love bacon!!) I took the order to go because I'm working. It wasn't really that busy when I came in, so I absolutely cannot understand why my order took 35 minutes. To top it off, when I got back to work with my food, I discovered there were only 3 pieces of bacon!!! I paid $6 for 3 pieces? No way. For TWO sides of bacon, 3 pieces is unacceptable.

Sad to say, but I'll probably be back due to convenience."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to corner bakery. It's quiet, the food is good and the staff is nice. I especially am delighted with Ms Jaylyn. She is always so polite and considerate. Her smile is beautiful as she is and it makes me and my husband feel special when dining out. Thanks Jaylyn for being so wonderful. I am sure Corner bakery is proud to have you."}
{"text":"I'm happy to have Corner Bakery in downtown giving the limited lunch options we have downtown. I'm a huge fan of the Caesar Salad. Their vegetarian pasta is good as well and I also like their tomato mozzarella sandwich. The staff are very friendly and the manager took care of me very nicely when a takeaway order was stuffed up (they had just opened so a few hiccups are to be expected).
I have to say that I LOVE the ice machine for drinks. It makes the perfect ice for me to chew on and I always look forward to having a soft drink here. Yeah yeah yeah, I KNOW what they say about those who chew ice. Since I've been chewing ice since I was five years old maybe I should seriously consider therapy. Happy ice chewing aside, I'm happy Corner Bakery is here and know that I can always count on a good lunch."}
{"text":"Overall a decent place to have breakfast.  I had the All-American with bacon, eggs and pancakes.  The food didn't blow me away but it was priced right at less than $8.  I wish they had Cholulla hot sauce instead of just Tabasco.

Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. They Serve breakfast all day too. Pancakes are great! Give this place a try."}
{"text":"This was one of the easiest places to stop and grab food while I was nearby for work, so I ate here twice for lunch on a quick visit to Phoenix recently. 

The first visit I got the chicken noodle soup and southwest flat combo. The soup was good, pretty standard chicken noodle. The southwest flat doesn't look very impressive (they're pretty small), but it was surprisingly delicious and seemed bigger once I started eating it. Lots of chicken and the bread is really good. 

For the other lunch I had an entree version of the Spinach Sweet Crisp salad. Though the $8-9 price tag seemed a little bit hefty for a salad without protein, it was good - lots of fruit, and the goat cheese and toasted cinnamon bread croutons made it more of a meal. 

Overall, the food is good and fairly fast. Lots of seating and in a convenient location. The one gripe I have is that I couldn't find an outlet to plug my computer into. For a place that would cater well to the afternoon coffee/working lunch crowd (they have free wifi), it seemed like there would be outlets at some of the tables, but there were not."}
{"text":"They have Corner Bakeries all over, and today we had two breakfast items.

Ordered the banana oatmeal and the bacon/cheddar breakfast sandwich.  The oatmeal is beyond filling.  It could almost feed two people, or one really hungry person.  Totally dug it, and I would get it again.  The breakfast sandwich on the other hand was just OK.  It lacked something.  And that's saying something for a breakfast item with bacon.  Bacon should elevate anything to outer-world limits...but no so with this one.  Come here for a quick breakfast fix that is decently good."}
{"text":"The coupon they send out to customers who sign up on E-mail is an awesome deal, 2 for $9.99. I usually order the turkey sandwich and the sweet something...salad. My favorite indulgence is the small choc bundt cake. The lemon loaf is good also. The service is friendly. The portion of the salad is inconsistent, hence only 4 stars."}
{"text":"The cafe definitely has an interesting concept of ordering and paying first. Which I thought was a great idea. It was awesome to also know the nutrition facts of what you ate and have healthy alternatives. However when I got my apple chicken sausage Paganini (thin choice) It was definitely not as big as the pictures made it seem. It was a good thing I added a bowl of fruit, which was nice but was definitely not fresh. Overall it was very reasonable priced and the food was average. The staff was great though 4 stars on their behalf."}
{"text":"Corner Bakery has become our favorite restaurant since moving to the area. My wife and I have explored most of the menu and we have loved everything that we have tried. The breakfasts, the paninis, and the pastas are all wonderful. The black currant tea alone is worth the trip."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!  Waited 1 hr for food.  Workers were inept.  Not busy.  No coffee.  Customerservice thee worst.  Don't bother coming here.  We were telling customers don't bother and go someplace else."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great good. Staff is terrific. Great spot for a lunch or dinner date."}
{"text":"Disappointing! Over 30 minutes and we didn't receive our food, while we noticed that people who ordered after us received their food. We did get our money back after we went to the cashier to complain. We were told they were having \"technology\" issues, which I'm not exactly sure what that meant."}
{"text":"I love this place! My very first one I went to was in Glendora CA. I was so excited when I saw they were opening one local to me!! They have really good food here! Soups, sandwiches and more! I love the lemon bar!"}
{"text":"This place has some great breakfast and lunch. The service is great, and there is never a long wait. 

This last time was a little bit of a bummer, because we found hair in both of our dishes :( 

I mean...we all have eaten a little bit of hair :) I have a feeling someone was not following the rules that day. 

It is worth giving it a shot! A little hair never killed anyone."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a fun meal!
We love to eat outside. The panini's and salads are fantastic and the pastas are very good too
We've eaten here a few times. The first time, 4 months ago, we weren't very impressed but the last few times, the food has been fantastic and the service is much approved!
Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Located on Highland and 20th st. 
This is in the old Miracle Mile location. It has been totally remodeled and looks great. They did a nice job.  A perfect spot to grab a bite before grocery shopping. 5 stars

Service: 
We were promptly greeted as we entered. We were offered some great recommendations once she realized it was our first time. We appreciate that. 5 stars

Food:
I ordered the pesto chicken capavatti, which as amazing. I also got a ceasar salad(1.75 upcharge for side) will skip that next time. It was just ok. The gf got the loaded baked potato soup and caprese salad. Also very good soup, again her salad just ok. I tried the soup..will get that next time. Price was avg. $25 for dinner for 2 w drinks.  Overall 4 stars for food

To top it off we were given each a free cookie. They were awesome. Will be back for these! 5 stars for the freebie.

See you next time. Keep up the good service"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for brunch or whenever you're in the mood for some casual food! The service here is extremely polite and to the point, the food itself arrives to you in a timely manner. The menu is average sized for what you'd expect for a cafe; on it, they offer delicious sandwiches for lunch. I come back here often when I need something to eat during the day. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family!
If you're in the mood for something light and sweet, try the chocolate baby bundt cake!"}
{"text":"I went here with friends and loved the price and quality coffee. I had an avocado spinach flat, and it was great!  If come here again."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Corner Bakery before and when I was eating somewhere a while back it showed up on my phone when I was checking in.  I saw it opened at 6AM so I gave it a try.  The food was decent.  The price was reasonable.  The wait for the food was not too long. At 6 on a Wednesday it certainly was not hopping, there was only one other customer while I was there.  Everything was well stocked at the station.  There was certainly a soulless corporate vibe to the place, the open room with no noise in it except the women behind the counter talking certainly did not help. Now that I know what it is, it would not bother me to eat at another one if I was traveling."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of time and thought I'd stop in to use the inter-net and grab some lunch, a change from my usual stop at Starbucks.  Corner Bakery's inter-net is so slow. I can't get some of the work done that I really wanted to.  I love their sandwiches, salads, and breakfast rolls, but if I can hop on the inter-net to take care of a couple of things, it doesn't work too well for me. I'll be back, just not as often - and not with intentions of using my computer. Please increase your inter-net speed!"}
{"text":"Been here several times, majority of the time there is some kind of issue. Very inconsistent. Keep coming back because they have excellent coffee and I love the avocado and egg power flat....but went on Sunday for the last time. Was treated rudely by the girl taking my order because they were out of oatmeal (seems they are constantly out of something) and I questioned it. When they delivered the food, my friend got the wrong sandwich (it was supposed to have avocado and bacon on it and had neither) and it looked straight out of the microwave. She took it back and ended up getting a flat, which costs less than what she ordered but of course no one offered to reimburse her the difference. 

If this was an isolated incident, I'd let it go, but I have had many issues and they seem to surround the kitchen staff and some of the order taking staff.  The manager seems nice but really needs to get things in line. It's hit or miss so I'm done."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at this location recently. The service was fast, friendly and efficient.
The restaurant was clean, the food was delicious. I ordered the clubhouse panini, it came with potato chips and a pickle. My husband ordered half a turkey sandwich, and broccoli cheddar soup. They offer a good assortment of sandwiches and soups, along with cookies and other bakery items.
I recommend trying Corner Bakery Cafe. The food is always delicious, the service good. I will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Corner Bakery Cafe has freshly made soups and sandwiches for lunch. They also serve breakfast. My husband and I ate at the N. 3rd location on Friday, April 1st. We were there for lunch. I ordered a sandwich combo- a 1/2 uptown turkey with a mixed greens salad, a bag of chips came with it and a raspberry tea. My husband ordered a 1/2 chicken salad sandwich and a cup of cheddar broccoli soup with lemonade to drink.
The service was excellent, the food delicious, the patio where we chose to sit is a nice place to sit if you don't want to sit inside the restaurant. We chose to sit outside to enjoy the coolness of the weather.
My husband returned to buy a cookie and was given one on the house. (My husband always wears his retired Navy ball cap) so I don't know if it was because of his hat or not but it was unexpected and appreciated by us. 
My husband has ate breakfast at this location previously and enjoyed the food and service.
I should also mention their restroom facilities are clean. The employees that work there care about their customers. The young lady cleaning the tables outside kept the tables bused and came and cleared our dishes away. She was friendly. 
We will return to this location soon."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good. Considering the line, we didn't wait too long for our food to be brought to us. We ate on the patio. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is hands Down the worst Corner Bakery I've ever been to. I ordered a half sandwich, half ma and cheese and the Mac and cheese was cold, and stale. Well I notified a manager and she asked me \"I can put in the microwave for you\" or \"I can make you a new order\". I said \"could I have a new one\". So literally 30 seconds later she brings me back the bowl with the bowl being hot and the food still being cold. Thank you for such poor services. Never coming back again"}
{"text":"I have been here several times for breakfast - usually before/after getting my truck washed at the nearby Jackson's.  I visited today for lunch and I'll be back again for lunch!  I selected the Trio options - many items to choose from and I chose the mixed greens, fresh fruit and chicken salad (around $8.00).  The salad did actually have mixed greens (not just a bunch if iceberg lettuce) with four slices of fresh tomato.  There was a great mixture of fresh fruit as show in the picture.  The chicken salad was yummy and a portion that was a good value.  Each time I've visited, I have received great service - everyone very friendly.  The facility has been clean, including the restrooms.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped for some sweet after lunch a couple doors down. Super friendly and the cookies were all to die for!"}
{"text":"When I worked near here, I was certainly excited there were more restaurants in which to choose in the Arizona Center.  

The food is pretty good but very overpriced.  I love the sandwiches made on pretzel bread with cheese, tomatoes, etc.   The mac and cheese is pretty tasty.  The salads are small but good.  Desserts are about average for this style of place. 

The service?  Not so great.  Maybe three years ago, I do not recall it being so bad. The employees were fairly quick and friendly. Lately, it's general apathy.  Also, the hours are wrong. More than a few times on a weeknight, this restaurant has closed around 6pm, not the 8pm indicated.  This has happened on Monday and Wednesday nights, more than once.  Please change the hours to reflect this. 

Not worth the money, time, or attitude."}
{"text":"I just catered with the corner bakery and they did a wonderful job. They showed up on time and the young lady helped me set everything up. She was smiley and helpful..
The food looks amazing...i know my guests are enjoying it right now :)"}
{"text":"Omg how come nobody told me there is a Corner Bakery Cafe in town. I missed and love their fresh hazelnut cream coffee and delicious blueberries muffin! 

We came here for late dinner(well about to close), we got soup and salad,the Spinach salad with strawberry vinaigrette was still fresh and tasty  and the broccoli cheddar soup was good with the warm bread! 

Services was great, I ordered a regular coffee but they have ran out for the day, the staff said she would brew a new pot just for me, I kindly said no, yet so thoughtful. Love Corner Bakery Cafe!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Corner Bakery in California.  First time at this location.  I came in for a pastry.  The cashier Iris was so nice.  Greeted me with a smile, very friendly.  I asked her what she would pick between a lemon pastry and the cinnamon cream cake.  She said the cinnamon.  She was right.  So moist, just yummy."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! Fresh, fast, and great tasting food! Presentation of food very well plated. Atmosphere is awesome! Need more of these everywhere! St. Rose area would be perfect location! Definitely a regular spot for us now!"}
{"text":"The food is quality and the customer service is top notch. Fast service too. A recommendable establishment."}
{"text":"With how terribly this is rated, I didn't expect much from this place as my boss and I walked over from the Sheraton for an early lunch before catching a plane. They were transitioning from breakfast to lunch as we walked in, so I ditched my egg and toast mindset for a 'pick 2' option, which is similar to the pick 2 at panera. I was really impressed that you could choose anything from the menu as your pick 2, so I got the regular Mac and cheese and a chicken pomodori panini. While the Mac and cheese was a touch salty for me, I was in love with the panini. If I could eat that panini every day for the rest of my life, I would. I was underwhelmed by the mac, but the panini was so gold it didn't matter.
I was starving when we arrived, and my carb heaven order came with a side of chips which I happily packed for the long plane ride. I thought it was nice we got a side when there was already so much food on the tray. 
My boss got a hot coffee and a tuna salad sandwich. He loved the sandwich and I was impressed at the 4 different coffee options you could choose from. 
We also took forever to order and the guy at the counter was really nice about it. The seats at the booths are a little torn up and in need of replacement, but other than that the decor was nice and not unlike any other regular coffee or sandwich shop. This was a great option near the hotel."}
{"text":"Always good. Staff amazingly friendly.  Have been there many times.  Everything on the menu is fantastic. Always clean and fresh looking inside.  Great neighborhood spot.  Fun to sit outside."}
{"text":"Real eggs!!! Real bacon!  Extremely clean. Prices are fair, better than most. Free refills on the coffee with a self serve bar. Food is brought out to you so you can sit and enjoy your coffee. No need to clean up your area. Food is plated on fancy plates like you would see on master chef. Breakfast is served all day not just in the morning. Extra fabulous staff."}
{"text":"The Good- the Food was not bad at all, the  gentleman that took my order Javon, he was outstanding, he was super honest about every dish, he even recommended what to order and what not to order LOL I respect that!!!

The bad- Coffee sucks! Everything Looks fanct and Gourmet but don't believe the hype, Coffee was trash the hot chocolate was trash too!

The Ugly-  My husband and I paid $20, for a small portion of food, for that you may as well eat at IHop or Dennys

Overall, I would come back here for a quick bite, preferably on pay week, because it's over priced food, and I would buy coffee elsewhere before I walk into Corner bakery"}
{"text":"This is an incredible new bakery on Stephanie and warm springs!!! Everything is super fresh and healthy. Service was excellent and I loved everything about it. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I normally love this place, but today it was gross. It was after the lunch rush. Most employees just hanging around and every table in the place was covered with dishes. Customers long gone. Ending up sitting at a table full of dishes. Next time I am going to look at the tables and if they are dirty, I am walking. 

It if looks like this in the front of the house, what is it like behind the doors?"}
{"text":"We went here for soup, on a day when neither of us were feeling well. We ordered one chicken noodle and one loaded baked potato soup in bread bowls. We felt like it was a little less than a small cup of soup in each because none of the bread had been carved out. It was as if soup had just been poured on top of the bread minus the top which had been cut off. Other than the quantity issue the soups themselves were okay, but the chicken noodle seemed no better than something bought in the grocery store."}
{"text":"It's like Paradise Bakery but with a more diverse and far better menu."}
{"text":"Just had one of the best salads of my life! Spinach Sweet Crisp. We need one of these on the west side of town!"}
{"text":"Wait, since when did Corner Bakery make it to Arizona?  I've been to several in the U.S. and they are all pretty consistently good.  You're definitely paying more for a meal, but for faster food, it's good stuff.  This Corner Bakery lived up to the brand's name!

First, thank's to the owner for coming over to say hello.  That was so nice and a good change from the usual impersonal lunchtime visit at a restaurant that has a sizable to-go business.

Second, the salad was excellent.  I had the small Asian salad with chicken and it was very good.  The tangy dressing had a nice zing, and they left off the wontons as requested (nothing worse when you make a request to leave off an ingredient and it's sitting on your plate staring you in the face).

They have a nice selection of healthy foods.  I'm so happy this place made it to the Scottsdale area!  It's such a great place to grab a moderately priced, nice lunch.  P.S. they have a very comfortable outdoor space!"}
{"text":"I had a friend in college who would rave about Corner Bakery and make special trips to Chicago just to get their baked goods.  Needless to say, this place had been hyped up as a pretty solid chain.

So, when they opened up shop here in Peoria, I was pumped.  Like many other reviewers have commented, it really is just okay.  It really is more like a 2.75 star, but something in me doesn't want to round up to the 3-star.

I usually get the Santa Fe salad (sans chicken) and it is just fine.  The baked goods that I have had weren't worth the calories (if I'm going to eat that kind of stuff, it better be worth it).  The service is pretty attentive- although they are randomly psycho about retrieving the number cards they use to give you your order.

I'd rather go to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Little disappointed. The food was good except the bacon mac and cheese. It was terrible! No cheese on it. I would definitely call it middle of the road. They also forgot my sons meal."}
{"text":"High school people taking orders can be very good or very bad.  Zero friendliness this time.  No customer-centricity.  Just a 'what do you want' kind of attitude.  Burnt pancakes.  Burnt eggs. $9 for this?  I can burn my own pancakes and eggs at home for less than 9 bucks.  I don't like this place from the 1st time I came but my wife does, so we came today.  I don't like this place place because the portions are slightly smaller than I'd like and although the pancakes are fluffy, they are burnt.  Coffee is good, but it would be better if the kids behind the counter could be friendly."}
{"text":"ARROWHEAD HONDA can't put into words how AWESOME Brandon has been. The catering for 90+ has been spectacular and the food is mmmm Good! One of the best Cesar Salads and all the pastas are very flavorful and creamy. We fell in love with their catering and food. Brandon has even gone out of his way to surprise some of us with individual lunches. Keep it Brandon and Corner Bakery Cafe."}
{"text":"Great location in downtown. Perfect spot for lunch after church at the AMC theater. Food is very tasty and doesn't take to long to arrive."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for several years now.  Most consistently good food for breakfast in downtown.  Specials on Saturdays.  Try my namesake the \"MIACH\" for breakfast special if offered.  It is a buttery croissant with scrambled eggs, bacon and Swiss and hash browns, to perfection, on the side.  YUMMY!!!!!  And I want to give a shout out to the servers that are great!! Paula, Krista, Zeus, Balthazar and our favorite, Dawn!

This review was supposed to be for the 5th AV Cafe in Phoenix.  Sorry can't delete it.  Never been here."}
{"text":"I have dined at Alma twice in the past two day, once for lunch and once for breakfast. Both were very pleasant experiences. Out \"ladies who lunch\" group ordered salads that were delicious and had lovely presentation. I had the ahi salad which was rightly recommended by our waiter.  

After reviewing the breakfast menu, I suggested Alma to my husband and sister for our Saturday morning get together. If you like tasty and large pancakes, Alma is for you. My husband had one of the pumpkin and one lemon ricotta pancake along with eggs and very crispy (yum bacon). My sister had the blue berry pancakes and I had a tasty Mediterranean omelet with good gluten-free toast and tasty potatoes. The decaf coffee was also flavorful and not a bitter cup of Joe. We all left with to go boxes. 

I must mention the friendly waitstaff. Eric was our lunch time waiter and Val was our waitress at breakfast. Both were very friendly and attentive.

The kitchen at Alma tries to accommodate finicky eaters such as myself with gluten free options and almond milk for my coffee.

I think the menu items are priced fairly.

My husband and I have added Alma to our restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"I expected a Paradise Bakery experience the first time I went, and was pleasantly impressed. Similar fare, but better. 

I've been there only once for breakfast -- their oatmeal is delicious!

My nearly-ninety-year-old mother and I have gone back several times for lunch. As at Paradise, you can get the three-salad sample. But I think the salads at Corner Bakery are far more creative. The Harvest Salad is especially yummy. I'm really interested in the Ginger Asparagus Couscous Salad, but -- alas -- I don't like cucumbers and they're already mixed in.

Every one of their soups has delighted. The sandwiches that we've tried have all been good, but so far I haven't run into anything particularly special.

What is special is the service. Though they can't take the cucumbers out of the Asparagus Salad, they *did* take the bread off my mom's grilled Reuben sandwich. She can't eat bread, but really wanted my sister or me to get the Reuben just so she could have a taste. Instead, the cooks made up a delicious sandwich for her -- sans bread. The entire staff is very accommodating.

I'm following Weight Watchers right now, so haven't been able to graze the baked goods yet. But I've been assured by my sisters and mother that everything is great! None of us can go by 83rd Avenue now without picking up a package of Sweet Crisps to take home to Mom.

As far as Weight Watchers... Their 3-Lentil Soup/Half-Sandwich combo keeps your points right there in the safe zone. Just pick their tuna or Bavarian turkey for your half sandwich.

Oh, and they have free wifi. So if you want a place to go to enjoy food, not have to rush, not have a wait-staff in your face, but know that they'll be there to help when you need it, I recommend Corner Bakery Cafe."}
{"text":"Since I work close by, we order to go from this location when we are busy and need to get a quick lunch. One of the best thing that I had when they first opened was their pretzel bread sandwich.  I got the turkey on pretzel today and it was disappointing.  The bread was cold, hard and stale.  My co-worker said she stopped ordering that sandwich because her last order had old bread too.  Ended up throwing most of the sandwich away and had just the side of fruit salad."}
{"text":"GREAT food!!!   I've had the Corned beef Reuben Panini several times and figgered I loved it enough I wouldn't try anything else.    On a whim,  I Just tried the Steak and cheese with mushrooms  on a baguette and now I think I'll keep getting that.   You can make a good sammitch on bad bread sometimes, but these guys have covered all the delicious bases.   *This* place makes a mean sandwich.   

You guys are killing it!   I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"Why do I torture myself with Corner Bakery? The ones near where I live are mediocre. I had hope this would be better. Their decor is always 10x better than their food. I don't want to go crazy with all that went wrong, but the food took forever, it came out wrong and the portion was tiny. They fixed it so they got 2 stars. But with a limited, simple menu, they completely blew it."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location numerous times and was thoroughly disgusted to find multiple mold spots on my Club Panini today. I'm perplexed as to how this was not seen prior to, during or after preparation!!! This is unacceptable and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I thought the food was very good I got a blt and cheddar broccoli soup. The service was fast and a little pricey but it is an upscale cafe. I would say its worth it."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this cafe opening so as soon as I could I went with my mom and son and was so disappointed!! The macaroni cheese and bacon dish was so-so but when they showed us the plate size when paying no one said the bowl would only be a quarter full I literally ate the entire thing in 5 bites really? So we left out if there still hungry pitiful the place was like a zoo no place to sit and when we found one we had to clean it ourselves. It's definitely someplace I won't go back to."}
{"text":"Good food but cold when received after long wait.  Would have given 4 stars if this hadn't had happened.  Great pancakes!"}
{"text":"I ordered the half chicken salad sandwhich and noodle soup. The chicken sandwhich was tastless. Bread was dry & the soup taste canned. Over priced for the portions, the service & quality of food. I will not return."}
{"text":"I love the look of this place and always drive by the one in San Diego. After having crappy coffee all day at my hotel, I was in need of a decent cup. I ordered a latte and received a cappuccino. Whatever, the sixteen year old at the counter isn't working at Starbucks. The espresso was decent and the foam was nice... I didn't complain. My banana walnut pound cake was a gritty, sugary disaster. The sandwiches looked good though."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, excellent breakfast all day. Clean, well maintained and stocked. Jaylyn was very friendly with the samples and Deja was bright and friendly. Their attitudes were a breath of fresh air. The person who delivered my breakfast Nony was sweet as wellWelcome to the neighborhood 

I went back today again to use my great coupon. Crowded but Diana Cardenas and Iris made the visit pleasant. I was in and out with my salads. Even Nony remembered and acknowledged me from the day before. Lovely place!"}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé went to this place the other day.  Let me tell you it was so good ! Our meals were delicious and we left full . We got the pick 2 , Santa Fe Ranch salad and chicken pesto sandwich. My fiancé got Uptown Turkey avocado and Linguine with meatballs. He loved the pasta . Before we left my boyfriend got linguine with meatballs to go . You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Food here is great but where can i enjoy my food if i cant sit anywhere? All the tables are dirty, full of dirty plates and no one seems to bus the tables. No we are forced to sit outside where its 96 degrees (Arizona) when we can be eating inside."}
{"text":"Went through drive thu and once was home found 2 pieces of long blond hair in my daughters salad. When I called just to inform them, the young lady on the phone was like oh ... smh. I won't be returning !!!"}
{"text":"So when you walk in somewhere and your first impression is a customer asking for a refund, you have to ask why.  he told me they were out of certain breads, certain pastas and couldnt make some of his dishes...hmmmm

So Monique asked me from 10' away if she could help me there, I asked her to join me in front of the display case so I could ask a few questions, it was obvious she was miffed, so I didn't ask, I just ordered two instead of 6 items...they lost that sale.

While packing them she slammed things around, slammed them in the bag and turned around and said, 'here you go'...no thank you, nothing...

It's pretty clear Monique isn't cut out for the service industry.  If I were manager, I'd be helping her today...she'd be looking for a new job"}
{"text":"I love this place. I work across the street and it is a regular lunch spot for me and my colleagues. Good food, good people, good prices."}
{"text":"Everyone here is awesome. I was here for the Ironman race and it was packed. Crazy busy. They seemed friendly, and unruffled by all the tired and needy race supporters (me) who wanted coffee right around the time the sun came up. They are totally pet friendly on the outside porch, going so far as to bring out water for our pug mascot, Lottie. I ordered a strawberry spinach salad and it was delicious. Honestly, I really liked this place and hope they succeed. Even the bathrooms were great."}
{"text":"Great quick bfast bite. I was staying across the street and I just wanted a quick lite bite before hitting the pool and this was a winner. Practically in hotel dining.

We had the french toast which is more like a casserole and a scramble."}
{"text":"I recently moved into the area and was referred here. I was hoping to find something like Panera. Well I did!!! The customer service has always been great and in off hours it's pretty empty. Great environment to get some homework done."}
{"text":"Nicest Corner Bakery I've been to.   Food is always great at them all but I really liked the layout and decor."}
{"text":"YA for downtown Phx! Glad this place seems crowded for breakfast and lunch with corporate crowd. The bakeries are amazing (brownies are super chewy and rich) and the lunch combos good too. I love that you can get 1/2 sandwich with soup, salad or WAIT Mac & Cheese!  Yes, please!  More places should follow there lead.  I am a lover of pasta, but a sammy and mac & cheese is the best of both worlds.
I have used them for catering as well and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"This place rocks!
I work nearby and the have great breakfast sandwiches and the Swiss Oats are amazing! Great salads and sandwiches. Staff is always so nice and kind. Always fast service for dine-in to take-out."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend. I ordered through the Yelp app for pickup and it was not what I anticipated at all. First they couldn't find my order. They asked how I ordered and I told them. So I sat patiently and after a couple minutes an employee asks me again what app I used to order. I told her Yelp and she replied with an attitude that \"that's impossible we don't get orders through Yelp\". But as you can see from my screen shot you guys DEFINITELY take orders through there. So I pull up the app on my phone I walk her through to where it shows my order and she STILL insists that this restaurant has no association with Yelp and that she has no idea. She apologized for the wait but like she really didn't care about the problem. And the way you handle talking to customers is appalling. I cannot stand a restaurant that has no idea what's going on. From now on I and the rest of the office will be going for our daily lunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"I use to order from corner bakery all of the time. However the last time they got my order wrong so I took it to the counter to get it fixed.. well as I was waiting for them to remake my sandwich I noticed the worker in the back opening my mustard packets with her TEETH. I was so disgusted! Not only is this unsanitary this is a huge health hazard! I will NEVER eat here again! I notified another employee after I seen the incident with the employee opening mustard packets with her teeth and they got the manager.  Needless to say the manager didn't seem to concerned and said she would speak with the employee. If this is a restaurant establishment they should have proper containers for their mustard and not be using mustard packets and having their employees open them with their mouths. DISGUSTING! I also seen another employee wear their gloves while wiping down equipment with their rags and then go to making an order without switching gloves. If you want to eat at a unsanitary place then eat here otherwise skip this place. I will never give them my business again and I will be telling everyone I know to stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago, was very clean and they greeted me as I walked in. The lady at the cashier was very helpful with what to choose. I got some chicken pesto sandwich with five cheese macaroni: was very good."}
{"text":"My favorite Corner Bakery and general breakfast place in town. The service is stellar, the food is addicting and the management always make sure you're well taken care of. Curtis and Lea always make you feel like you're family. I've gotten the Avocado and Spinach power flat like 5 times just this week and can't get enough of their Berry Almond and Swiss Oats. Their lemon cake is also tasty, soft and fluffy. Great place for working on your laptop as you eat breakfast!"}
{"text":"A go to place for breakfast for me. The pancakes are not as good as Joes on 7th avenue, and the atmosphere is not a cool as The Adobe at the Biltmore, but you will not be disappointed. So lets get to it.

The staff is fun and attentive and they keep the place spotless. You order at a walk past counter but the people will make recommendations and talk to you so take advantage of that. 

The pastries are adequate but the eggs and other fresh cooked items have never disappointed me. The coffee is always hot and good with more than one type.

Value - Well Grassroots is across the street and you will get better value here. I know it is not as trendy at Corner Bakery but like cigars and fancy cars, trendy does not always equate to value.

So if you need to meet a client, or a prospect, for breakfast or lunch try this out. The food will be good, yo will be able to hear each other, and you can afford to pick to the tab."}
{"text":"Tried Corner Bakery Cafe for the first time today and both the service and food were above expectation. Welcomed with a smile and friendly service from the counter staff. We ordered an All American Scrambler, and Avocado and Spinach Power Flat with an added fruit cup. The food was delicious. The All American Scrambler was pretty straight forward with eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. I especially liked my Avocado and Spinach Power Flat. Not too big, but enough to make you feel satisfied. The fruit cup wasn't all that great. Cantaloupe and pineapple wasn't fully ripe, but that was the only negative. Person who brought our food was welcoming also, striking up a brief conversation and making us feel welcome. Work being close to the place we tried having our Monday morning meeting here. The service, food and free Wi-Fi made for a great experience and we'll be back for our next meeting."}
{"text":"My mother & I stopped in for lunch after doing some shopping in the area. It reminded us of Kneaders Bakery & Cafe so we thought okay let's give them a try. 

I had the Harvest Salad which consisted of field greens, chicken, cranberries, toasted walnuts, bleu cheese, chopped apple, raisin pecan sweet crisps (bagel crisps?) with balsamic vinaigrette. Not sure about other people but when I have a salad I prefer more greens over toppings. The greens to toppings ratio was way off with very little greens and too much toppings!!  I ended up putting 3/4 of the toppings to the side.  I also ended up taking out all of the raisin pecan sweet crips, it was too much plus the pieces were big. Just too many unnecessary calories. The overall taste was good once I tweaked it to my liking.  The side of bread that came with it was soft & chewy. 

My mom had the Uptown Turkey Avocado sandwich with a side of chips. The chips were good but as for the sandwich she said it was just okay. There was a lot of liquid dripping from it from the tomato slices causing some of the bread to become soggy. 

Restaurant & bathroom were clean. Staff was friendly.  Food was just okay.  Being that I live on the opposite side of town I highly doubt that I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was great, location is wonderful, met the owner, super guy!
This place is really pretty, great out door seating. While my roast beef and cheese sandwich was delicious, it was just a tad on the small side. I'm a big eater. Reasonably priced, service is fabulous and the people are so friendly. I still definitely be back.
NOTE,:  they serve breakfast all day"}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast each day during my stay in Phoenix. I experienced the Anaheim scramble panini, pancakes, fruit cup.  Panini stood out. Fresh ingredients. Bread was excellent. Service was very friendly and efficient. Staff seemed to enjoy working there. Only one request. Please lengthen your hours. Open at 7 am on Saturday as the Starbucks line was almost a block long. Also open until 8pm each night would be great for those at convention center."}
{"text":"Corner Bakery Cafe is a comfortable restaurant focusing on breakfast and lunch cuisine with locations nationwide. I enjoy dropping by for a quiet tasty lunch.

Service:  Polite and friendly but nothing exemplary. The cafe is run in the fast casual style but with no need to bus your dishes. 4/5.

Food: Recently the chain introduced a reuben panini which has quickly become a favorite. There is also a wide range of options, mostly suited for a breakfast and lunch audience. 4/5.

Ambiance: Nothing stands out about Corner Bakery Cafe, but that's kind of the point. A nondescript joint where you go to blend in with the crowd and enjoy a quiet meal. 4/5.

Parking: The Mill Avenue location is a notoriously difficult parking area, but with the light rail station and a few nearby lots, it's not as difficult to find a space as you might expect. Meters run until 10pm everyday except Sunday. 3/5."}
{"text":"I decided to finally check out this cafe and was very pleased! The prices are very inexpensive and the food is good too. I was surprised to see that there was no wait at 7:00am on a Thursday.Their chai tea was one of the best (right up there with Panera). You can definitely taste the different spices!

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here strictly for the vegetarian panini.

I had one completely starving bite and though it wasn't that bad. Everything was downhill from there.

The panini was DRENCHED in oil, so every time you touched it you had to wipe your hands on a napkin. I  must have used 10. Seriously. Also, their \"homemade\" chips were also incredibly greasy. 

This has never happened before, but I ate a completely vegetarian meal and felt like it was Thanksgiving and I felt like passing out. No good. No good at all.

It was the middle of a saturday, and it was totally empty as well. Not sure if this is just because of the Arizona Center, or what.. but I wouldn't go back. 

I miss paradise already!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard food. I've gotten the California Grille panini and I always think it's gonna be better than it is. The tomato basil soup is good, and the desserts are sweet and calorie-laden, as they should be. Got the harvest salad today and it could've used more cheese but it was filling. Location is convenient from work but there are other places in the Arizona Center that are worth a try."}
{"text":"Ah easily one of my favorite places to dine out! My husband and I eat here at least twice a month and love going for breakfast and lunch!! Delicious oatmeal, sandwiches, and chocolate bunt cakes keep me coming back!!"}
{"text":"Strike one...bad service in the drive through.  It can happen.  An apology is/was all that was needed.  Strike two, rather than post a negative review here, I gave CBC another chance to respond via comment to their corporate office.  While they require you to provide your phone number and email address to respond, it's been a few weeks and they've yet to do so.  Too bad there are plenty of other options in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Waited 10 years for Corner Bakery to come to Vegas. Doesn't disappoint at all. Absolutely love it. Hopefully more locations coming. Chicken pomodori a must."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner a couple nights ago with the boyfriend and we had a nice time! I got the bavarian sandwich/caeser salad combo (my sandwich was turkey onion mayo/mustard and lettuce on pretzel bread yummy!) and the salad was good. The boy got the club panini and chicken noodle soup. Apparently his was so good I wasn't able to try more than a tiny nibble...haha. Their iced tea was DELICIOUS. Overall, I'd go back. :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch spot for a quick bite to eat or a cozy dine in. They have a large menu with many options, including lots of light or substitute options if you're trying to maintain a healthy diet. I'm a fan of their egg white breakfast paninis with a side of oatmeal. Definitely a filling breakfast meal that's not too calorie heavy. Service is always fast and friendly. Plus if you're in a hurry, they even have a drive thru so you can quickly place your order then grab and go."}
{"text":"This is such a great place!   Great product and great service!  The food is so delicious and fresh.
The selection is perfect for those who can't make up their mind!!! The paninis and salads are also a great choice.  Good food for your money.
I have little nephews and nieces and this is a healthy choice vs. drive thru anything!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast restaurant in the area.  Food is great and plenty of it.  The staff is friendly and polite.  A pleasure to go there and eat."}
{"text":"What an odd experience. Went in at 9am to purchase two dozen cookies for a meeting. The woman working the counter told me she couldn't give me 2 dozen. I assumed that meant she didn't HAVE 2 dozen. I asked if she had enough for one dozen, and she said, \"Oh, we have more than two dozen but if I sell them all to you, I won't have any left.\" 

Yes. That's right. Because you would have sold them all. 

Also, you're a bakery. Last I read, bakeries profit from selling baked goods. Well, apparently not this one. They prefer to hold onto old baked goods rather than expend the energy to make more. 

Wow. Lesson learned. Won't be coming back to this spot."}
{"text":"I drove half an hour to get here to get a bowl of soup for a sick friend. There were still a woman ordering inside and people eating. And they locked the door and closed TWO HOURS before they were scheduled too. There were other disappointed customers outside with me as well. I even paid for parking and this was my sole purpose of coming out here. I am disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I use Corner Bakery quite often for corporate events!!  Today, this location was supposed to have delivered between 11:00am and 11:15am - they never called to say they would be late!!!  At 11:30am I get a phone call from our Las Vegas office saying the food had  NOT been delivered!  I call - they tell me the Catering manager is not there and they had no information!!!  I asked to wait to speak to someone!  They finally get on the phone at 11:50am and say their ETA is 15 minutes! Negative - they delivered at 12:21pm and they discounted ONLY $20!!! Really?!! When I call back - the hang up on me!!! AAANNNDDD they still charged me $33.00 for delivery!  Needless to say, won't be using this location again!!!"}
{"text":"I was getting some of my shopping done at the nearby grocery store but decided to pop in here for breakfast. I am so glad I did! The customer service was really beyond my expectations. I got one of their power paninis with a side of fruit. I probably stayed longer than I thought I would once I found out there was free wifi! Such a great addition to the neighborhood. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Broccoli cheddar soup was great. Southwest chicken salad not so much. Had a weird quinoa salsa that had cucumbers in it. Never had a southwest salad with cucumbers in it before. Very weird combination. Also charged me extra for the chicken in a southwest chicken salad. Didn't want to argue any more because I did not want a sandwich."}
{"text":"Corner Bakery delivers consistently good food at reasonable pricing.  This location is no exception.

My girl and I had the chicken panini and chopped cafe salad.  Everything was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"If just stopped in for a Chai tea, so cannot comment on the food. The Chai was okay. It was slightly watered down. It's very dark inside the restaurant, but there is seating outdoors."}
{"text":"Our daughter chose this place for lunch. This is like a Paradise Bakery with cookies, muffins, salads and sandwiches, etc. We placed our order, got our drinks and nestled in a booth. 
After fifteen minutes of waiting, I went up to ask where our food was and the cashier was on the phone. I waited patiently for her to finish he call and asked where our food was 'cause we have been waiting. She said it was on the counter behind her and she would have someone bring it out. I don't know how long it was sitting in the counter.
Went to wash my hands and there were no paper towels. With my wet hands I approached her again and told her of the situation. I politely asked for a napkin so I could dry my hands and she said she was helping a customer. Luckily an associate from behind the counter gave me some.
The classic Italian Sandwich, $8.29, was pretty large, about a foot long.The bread was a bit crunchy not fresh, but I don't think they get new bread deliveries on Monday.
My daughter had the 1/2 Corner Beef Rueben and  up of Chicken Tortilla Soup, $9 which wasn\"t anything to write home.
My wife has the Flatbread Southwest Sandwich with carrot sticks, $5.29, which was just the right amount of food.
We might come back to try something different.
Attitude of the cashier and  it receive our food on time had me drop a star."}
{"text":"Oh my!!!! I had the Cavatappi Marinara last night with some added parmesan and parsley and it was so so so good! :) The wait staff was super friendly and helpful, the location was clean, they validated my parking ticket and it was an overall pleasant experience. : )"}
{"text":"A nice spot to grab a quick lunch. My husband and I came in for a weekend lunch and were happy with all of our food and the service. Major bonus that they are open on Sundays when another favorite of mine is closed.

The inside of the restaurant was clean with employees constantly clearing tables. We were able to grab paper menus at the front to make our choices before getting to the counter. At the counter our cashier was friendly. 

I loved their meal options that allow for a choice of two items including salads, soups, sandwiches, and pastas. Menu prices were reasonable and we were happy with pricing for our lunches. I went for a seasonal berry salad and macaroni and cheese. My husband opted for a sandwich. My salad was full of fresh ingredients and I loved the raspberry vinaigrette. The macaroni and cheese was pretty good and came with a nice piece of cheese toast. My husband enjoyed his sandwich. 

The order at the counter and wait for food at the table system seemed to be working efficiently. We didn't wait long for food and our orders were correct upon arrival. We'll be back next time we are looking for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the amazing California breakfast sandwich with a hot chocolate to drink. I add a splash of the amaretto flavored coffee to that and it's outstanding.  The Oreo cheesecake brownie is pretty spot on too!"}
{"text":"Kids and I love this place for breakfast! Great kids menu, love their baked goods. Coffee is great! Staff attentive and friendly. It's our morning go to spot."}
{"text":"So cute. The food is phenomenal, great meeting or planning space. Huge menu. Significantly better than Panera or Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"I was absolutely thrilled when I heard Corner Bakery Cafe was coming to Henderson, but once the reality hit it was such a disappointment. Their food is good, but WAY overpriced and their employees are nice, but they can't seem to get their sh*t together. Every time I have been to this location they have forgotten something or screwed up my order. To charge what they charge, it ought to be right!"}
{"text":"Another Gourmet sandwich shop on par with Paradise bakery (or Panera Bread for you those of you not from the valley).  The food is quality, the prices aren't outrageously high, but there's nothing special about the place that makes me need to run back.

I stopped in before a spring training game across the street at the Peoria Sports Complex.  Had ham on a pretzel role.  The havarti cheese was unexpected delight from the traditional cheeses you get at most sandwich joints, but the salt on the pretzel role was awful.  While I understand that people like their pretzels salted, I didn't need all that.  After scrapping it off, I enjoyed my sandwich.  The small bag of chips are a welcomed, but unnecessary compliment to the meal.

Corner Bakery offers up a nice selection of soups, salads, sandwiches and baked goods.  It's worth checking out if you're in near one.  But its definitely not worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and very FRESH...the owner and manager are really on top of things....very reasonably priced for the excellent food you receive. Make sure you have a caramel  cappucino...they are yummy! LOVE the grilled paninis and the soups are fabulous too. Great for breakfast OR lunch."}
{"text":"Every time I order something from here it is always tasty. Breakfast sandwiches with fresh eggs and salads with soups and sandwiches. The food is always good. The bakery items are great too. This is my go to place when I want something delicious to eat."}
{"text":"Had to wait 20 minutes to get through a line of less than 10 people. Despite 2 additional employees hanging around, only 1 very slow register was open. Then had to wait 20 more minutes to learn that they were no longer making pancakes. Staff didn't seem to care at all"}
{"text":"This place is good. The food reminds me of Zupa's or Panera. There was nothing served at our table that was poor. I had the Club and it was good. The chopped salad was very good. I couldn't go 5 stars because I like to see some meat in my sandwich. I felt it was the bare minimum of luncheon meats. If you are a carnivore this is not the place to go. I was with three women and they would probably give it five stars. Yes, to me it is a chickplace. I will go to Jason's deli and get a sandwich but if the women in my life want to go to the Corner Bakery I'll tag along."}
{"text":"7/13/16

Signed up for their e-specials back when Yelp held a small event at the new Camelback location and received an e-coupon for a complimentary treat a couple of days before my birthday (valid for a whole week after).  Came in to redeem the coupon- I chose their Toffee Chip cookie- and also ordered an \"entree\" portion of their Mac & 3-Cheese.  The mac was OK- nothing special.  The sprinkling of toasted bread crumbs on cavatelli was a nice touch.  I should've tried the Pesto with chicken, instead, but I have a great pre-made pesto sauce at home and wanted to try something different.  Perhaps next year, or when I don't want to wait too long for pasta or a panini...

The place was clean and empty, save for the employees working and a lone Asian woman enjoying her tomato sauce-based macaroni/cavatelli entree.  She seemed content, enjoying her quiet time in this tranquil space."}
{"text":"Nice place with a lot of choices and good quality food. I usually go here for breakfast and love their panini sandwiches. Good food, just a little expensive and a little boring inside. I would give CBC 3 1/2 stars because I like it more than 3stars but not worth 4. Main reason is there is a lot of competition between bakery cages in the area. Paradise is down the street and Wildflower is opening up soon. Hopefully more more competition the bakery cafes will try harder to be better! 

Overall good solid sport for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"The food is decent but I always turn into a fat kid and order too much. Like 2 drinks, a sammy, a soup and two desserts, too much. Then, by the time I get everything, I have a few bites and  am full. BAH!!!!!!! Nothing really tastes great re-heated, AND I DETEST going on Sundays because every family has brunch and there is NO parking. I had to watch a woman in a walker shuffle from parking around the corner to the door, with help from her husband, because all of the handicapped spots were used and the place was PACKED.  I enjoy it, every time I go, but I am avoiding Sundays from now on."}
{"text":"Quality food and people.  Really enjoy eating a healthy breakfast here every morning after hitting the gym. Store is clean with many private booths, fast good service and excellent service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for lunch for the first time last Thursday. We were not familiar with the menu when we walked up to the counter so we stepped aside to read it. While we were reading the staff continued to say over and over can I help you. Ok , so we hurried thru the posted menu, ordered our food and found a table. I felt the restaurant was too small and crowded with furniture. This day it was not crowded with people. It was a pleasant visit as we ran into an old friend. We walked over to visit this old friend and the waitress ask us to move so she could get by although there was another route she could have chosen.  The food was just ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"Just below average. Never actually ate in one before. Our company always ordered in and the sandwiches and spreads were always very good and quality of food was very good. This experience however was slightly below average. Ordered coffee and the American scrambled. The coffee carafes were empty and the half and half was as well. When we brought it to their attention they did not want to refill the entire coffee canister but instead gave us individual coffee cups.  Food was fine but just some little touches like the salt and pepper on the table were empty."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple times. I like it more than paradise bakery, but havent been to wildflower recently, or panera at all. I thought the club panini was really good. A bit pricey, but that's how all of them are. I've had good service here."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast to try for the first time. Ordered the baked French toast. Eggs were over cooked, bacon was cold and French toast was more like a bread pudding."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast early on a Saturday, about 1 hour after opening. The tables were dirty and sticky, and the bathrooms were out of toilet paper and littered with garbage, which makes me suspect no one cleaned the bathroom and wiped down tables the night before. Ordered a scramble, which came to us lukewarm. Substituted fresh fruit for potatoes. The fruit was wilted and bland, and the juice in the fruit bowl was a dirty brown. Ew... The bread was the best part of the meal, but it wasn't even toasted.  This was one of the worst breakfast experiences I've had in some time.  The only redeeming quality of the meal was the friendly service."}
{"text":"Great service. Event got a free desert. Very kind and nice waitresses. They didn't keep people too long in the order line and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Good food here.  Nice atmosphere.  Food a bit pricey, but if you share, it's not too bad.  The Pecan Bar is awesome."}
{"text":"This very Corner Bakery Café has the distinction of being the first and only location in the Las Vegas valley. It likewise has the distinction of sharing a parking lot with one of the first two Chick-Fil-A's* in the Las Vegas valley. On a recent Saturday, I started off my weekend by trying the Corner Bakery Café for the first time.

  When I stepped out of my car, a positive omen was the aroma of baking food. Upon walking into the restaurant my question to myself was what food to order. The menu includes soup, breakfast platters, sandwiches, pastries, and paninis. At 8 o' clock in the morning I was up for breakfast. The takeout menus by the entrance came in handy. I am one of those people that prefer to examine a takeout menu instead of the overhead menus above the register. I decided on the All American Scrambler.

  The Corner Bakery Café is in the fast casual segment of the dining industry. The way it works with this fast casual food restaurant is that you order then pay at the counter, the cashier hands you a number, then you place the number at the table. In a few minutes somebody brings you the food. By the time that the plate is nearly empty, that person will nicely take away the plate. Javon. C  happened to be the friendly cashier that took my order. A regular customer on line in front of me was complimenting him on how he makes her day. Posthumously I am complimenting him on the kind act of knocking a nickel off my order to prevent me from breaking a $20 to pay the $10.05. Just as friendly as the cashier was the delicious looking cookies, bagels, muffins, and pastries in the display case below the counter.

  For some reason, this restaurant reminds me of a combination of Café Zupas and Farmer Boys. Maybe it is the electrical outlets where you can plug in a phone charger. It was at a bar table with an electrical outlet near the Coke fountain that I partook in this foodie adventure while charging up my Yelp companion: the Galaxy S.

   Before the woman delivered the All American Scrambler to my table, I filled up a small cup of coffee. At Corner Bakery Café, a small cup of bottomless coffee goes for $1.99. The four flavors of self-serve coffee were Baker's Blend, Sumantra Decaf, Café Europa, and Hazelnut Cream. I thought that the coffee was good yet that Einstein Bagels, Dunkin Donuts, and Starbuck's were superior. 

  The $7.29 All American scrambler (please see one of the pictures below) included three scrambled eggs, toast, and Moms Harvest potatoes. However, there was a slight problem. The Applewood bacon that was supposed to be included was missing in action. One of the reasons that I ordered this menu item was for the Applewood bacon. I am not going to deduct a star. Seeing first-hand how friendly the staff was I am confident that they would have brought the bacon back into action. However, the Applewood bacon might have been so delicious that I would have added a star and had an urgency to return here. The main reason that I didn't get up and nicely address the missing bacon was that I was comfortable sitting at the bar stool looking at my Galaxy S7 that was plugged into the outlet. Anyways, I regard the All American scrambler as good. In reality it is difficult to mess up scrambled eggs. And speaking of the scrambled eggs, the hot sauce that I picked up from the condiment station added additional flavor. As far as the potatoes, I felt that they could have added more to the plate, especially at the empty corner where the Applewood bacon was supposed to be.

  At the conclusion of this foodie adventure, I am left with the impression that there are more favorable breakfast places to spend my money. For example, I could spend an additional 75 cents at Einstein Brothers Bagels and have a Nova Lox bagel sandwich with a side and small bottomless coffee. This is an impression that shouldn't prevent me from returning here. Those delicious looking goodies in the bakery case left a lasting impression. If I return here, I intend to order a bakery case goodie with a bottomless cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago, we were pretty excited to see Corner Bakery come to Las Vegas. The food is good and the prices are fair, so we decided to give it a try for dinner. 

I had the pick 2 with the chicken soup and the tomato mozzarella sandwich. The soup is very good and hearty and it would be great on a chilly day. The tomato mozzarella sandwich is served warm which was a nice surprise and it was pretty flavorful. I enjoyed both items overall and they are definitely things I would get again.

I got to have a bite of the cinnamon cream cake as well and it is just as sweet and buttery as I remember. It is definitely worth a try. The slice that they give you is enough to share. 

While I don't know if I'll be itching to come back anytime soon, as there are other restaurants in the area I really love, I enjoyed my meal and I definitely want to come back and try some more of the delicious bakery items."}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood bakery. I go for lunch quite a bit, the sandwiches, soups, and salads I've tried have all been good. I also can't say enough good things about their manager (unfortunately I don't know his name!). He's always running around doing whatever needs to be done as well as making sure orders come out quickly and correctly. Today my 4 month old spit up and he actually ran and got me some
napkins before I even noticed that my son had destroyed my shirt! SO, good food, friendly service, and reasonable prices...it's why I keep going back!"}
{"text":"So, i have been on a so called diet lately and just wasn't really in the mood for heavy, greasy food. I was on my way to meeting a friend for a movie preview of Green Lantern and was driving around arrowhead area and passed several restaurants and decided it was either corner bakery or hooters (tough decision, i know). Never been to corner bakery, so I decided \"lets give it a go\". 

I walk in and I like the atmosphere of the restaurant, it is kinda like a quaint little cafe in a small town. At least the vibe you get even though it is a spacious restaurant with plenty of tables. The tables are not crowded though, you get your space.

On to the reason you would read this review, the food. I ordered the green chile and chicken panini. I enjoyed it very much. I have had many paninis and most are lacking in one important area: The bread. If you are a sandwich lover, you know the bread is the MOST important part. The panini was grilled to perfection, it was actually crispy and even had some blackened edges (This is a good thing, so many places under toast/grill the bread to where its not even crispy). The chicken and chile tasted wonderful as well. 

The sandwich was a healthy portion with chips and a slice of pickle for $7.50 was well worth it. The 2.25 for  a large soda was a little high, but I understand these days thats where they make there money...

I will be back and my search for a great panini is over..."}
{"text":"PANERA WANT A BE!!!!  Their food was ok at best fairly small portions.  Manager seemed to think eggs from a box were as good as fresh and tried to argue that.  Pancakes were ok they only serve bacon with no option of sausage.  It was brite and shinny but nothing to go back for.  They have very similar set up and menu of a Panera but like 1/3 their menu.  We were excited to see a new face in Henderson.  We came hungry and left still wanting more food.  Do yourself a favor skip this one.  Their are much better options for breakfast or lunch in Henderson."}
{"text":"I love this place, I was happy to see a new restaurant opening so I stopped in and just loved it. The food is yummy, omg the panini bread is just mmmm. The staff is super friendly and the coffee is great. Thanks all of you for making this a great place to relax and eat."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!! It's almost too good to be a corporate restaurant LOL. No, seriously. That meatball panini is out of this world. It's basically a pair of meatballs shoved in between pieces of sourdough bread. So good. Also, they have cavatappi pasta that's also great. Service is super quick and friendly. I also love the Sinatra music that plays over the speakers. 5 stars all day."}
{"text":"My kids and I went for the first time last week. Both kids loved their meals, and my turkey club panini was delicious. The food came out very quick and was cooked to perfection. All of the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Food is good.Their newest addition to their menu is grilled flats.  But for $8.00, their chicken grilled flat is too small. One would need to take at least two orders of those to fill up. Service is good though. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This restaurant continues to get worse and worse. I have been in twice in the last month. First time was eh. It was after the lunch rush and restaurant lacked ambiance, food was ok. Nothing great. 

Second time was so bad I will NEVER go back. Air was off, first complaint!  Hello, it's Arizona, sooo hot inside the restaurant. I went into the restroom and it was absolutely disgusting. In the handicap stall, the toilet tissue dispenser was on the ground, there was toilet tissue all over the ground. The other stall was no better, toilet paper all over the ground. The waste baskets were full to the top. Sink counter tops had water all over the top. 

I had a couple of friends come in for the first time to meet me and were waiting for a good 5 minutes to order food even though there was only 1 person at the counter ordering food in front of them. 

Don't need the aggravation and won't go back! Get it together guys."}
{"text":"The cafe is located in Arizona Center so you would think it would be packed with ASU students and individuals from conferences.  I ended up going there for work lunch thinking from all the choices available it would be an inexpensive lunch.  I ordered a half sandwich and soup with a drink.  It was over $10 and when I got the meal, it was less than impressive for the amount of money. A very little BLT half sandwich and broccoli and cheddar soup. Staff members were very friendly however, it was slow getting my meal and seems way over priced."}
{"text":"I like this new location! I can eat, get some work done, before hitting the Frys where I tend to shop just about every other day since we eat a lot and run out of everything. What Corner Bakery has not run out of is excellent customer service and good food! 
I will just review the soup for now since that is all I had room for in my tummy on my visit. The potato soup is fantastic! Very cheesy which I did not expect. Good piece of bread. I was surprised with a free cookie. So 4 stars for soup and a roll, plus that awesome cookie! And the 5th star is for my soup being Hot! Most lunch places have trouble serving piping hot soup. Luke warm is usually the norm. So when a soup comes from the kitchen, is walked clear across the restaurant and placed in front of me, and it's super hot and the best cheesy potato soup I ever had, then that is 5 stars in my book. I'll be back soon that's for sure!"}
{"text":"It was my first time in this place because of yelp event. 
The owner or manager, Tom, was friendly and super informative about the menu. 
I selected one of the menu, black been shiracha, it was awesome. The didn't taste spicy but had a little bit kick in there, and at the end of the bowl you could taste the other flavor like cilantro or lime, maybe, that was something refreshing. If you are not a big eater, I suggest you to order it in a bowl. The other option was serve on a bowl of bread. 
I also ordered Cuban press panini. I never been in Cuban so I couldn't tell the authenticity of this food. Although when I ate it, the bread was a little bit hard to chew till the end. 
I would like to go back to try something else in the menu and recommend this place to try, the service was great, the place was cozy to stay inside and outside."}
{"text":"Went there for the power lunch all the people were very friendly and the food was delicious I would tell all my friends about the corner bakery and thank you for a nice time"}
{"text":"Corner Bakery

I've been here a few times, and I always get the same thing - grilled cheese. So much variety Haha! 

When hey first opened, I ordered a grilled cheese and they put it on this multi-seed bread, which was really good, better tasting than on wheat. Another time I cam back it was on a different bread, not sure which it was, but it wasn't my favorite. The last time I went in, I asked about the bread and they told me the kind they had, excluding the multi-seed. When I asked if that was it, I was told well yea, a seed bread, but you wouldn't want that. Actually, that is the one I want. If I am the paying customer,  don't tell me what I do or don't want. That was my only flaw with this place. Otherwise, I like the food, and their service is pretty good too. They are always smiling and walking around to see if you need anything. 

I have only been for breakfast, so I don't know what is available for lunch. But they have the standard breakfast items - eggs, oatmeal, pancakes, etc. with bread items for purchase. 

They keep the inside clean as well. As soon as someone leaves, one of the staff is there to clean the area. 

I will keep coming back, as long as they don't tell me what I don't want for breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, super clean, and the food's not bad at all.  Despite the fact that I asked for extra mayo on my sammy, but got NO mayo, was a little annoying.  But, for some reason, something told me to pick up some packets of mayo.  So I was in the clear and my annoyance never gained traction into anything that prevented me from returning.  That, and the sandwich was pretty yummo.  They also give a pickle and a free bag of chips to go with it.

I do not, however, recommend the chocolate chip cookie.  No bueno."}
{"text":"Great location, amazing customer service! ...unfortunately the food is below average and tasteless! I love Paradise Bakery and hoped to find something similar in the area...I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"The manager, or owner, of this establishment is horrible. Constantly closes earlier than advertised store hours and will sit and watch while you eat if he is ready to go. I mean within the 12 minutes of him closing at 2! 10 people tried to come in and he just ignored them. I mean seriously. Its Saturday and you close at 2! I don't get his business sense he is still paying the rent for the rest of the day, and I'm sure the people who were ignored will not be coming back and neither will I. I like corner bakery as a brand, but I hope this one goes under!"}
{"text":"Oh how I've missed you Anaheim scramble! I haven't been here early enough lately to be hungry for breakfast. Anyone who knows me, knows that if its past 9am I'm already hungry for lunch items. So, today after I dropped my daughter off at school my truck seemed to switch to auto-pilot and drove me here.... my stomach agreed! 

I just can't resist avocado, bacon and cheddar cheese in my scrambled eggs. I tell myself every time on my way here that I'm gonna try the berry almond oatmeal and then I open the front door and I'm hit with the most heavenly scent - yes folks ... bacon. Yummy, crispy, thick, bacon.  (See my prior review of their BBLT - LOVE IT!) 

Iced tea lovers: try the black currant iced tea. Mmmmm. Delish even without sweeteners. (But I'm secretly hoping they'll start serving passion fruit tea as well someday) Hey, I can dream right? 

Not only does this place serve great food, I really love the relaxed atmosphere. Wish there was a corner bakery in Surprise. Boy, I just want to have my cake and eat it too don't I!"}
{"text":"I get lunch here regularly and they have lousy service. The staff does not know one food from another and I have been a cookie short/ wrong soup .. even sandwich. I was given a non veg sandwich and I am vegetarian. I was horrified because I had a couple of bites before realising it! I would recommend going to the subway next door just because at least you KNOW what goes in your food. Disappointed customer."}
{"text":"awful. went to phx for the comic-con and stopped here for breakfast. rubbery potatoes that were clearly from a bag and overcooked eggs. avoid."}
{"text":"It wasn't that great... I thought I would give it a chance even though the ratings aren't that great because the menu looks great.  The normal noodles were gone for the dish I got so they gave me spaghetti ones which was fine.  Then I ordered the entree size and only got the smaller size which was annoying because I got charged for the larger one... Didn't feel like complaining was more work than it was worth.  Overall 3"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad. Staff is friendly.  But the last 2 times I've placed an online order, I show up to pick it up and they don't have it.  They also gave me a ham sandwich instead of turkey today.  Disappointed.  :("}
{"text":"This was a sight for sore eyes on Sunday morning. I had a long Saturday night, so a gently-lit room with soft music was the perfect place to get my brunch on. The long line was discouraging, but the staff was speedy, and the ordering process was highly efficient. Take a number, and they'll find you.

No more than five minutes later, my order arrived with a smile. It was the advertised lunch item, the \"BBLT\". I thought the extra 'B' stood for the balsamic vinaigrette that ruined robust, locally-grown tomatoes, and I was wrong. It was emphasis on the supposedly generous portion of average bacon in the sandwich. In that aspect, it was mediocre.

To make matters worse, the mayo on the sandwich was...very acidic, to say the least. Wedged between what I believe to be lackluster sourdough, this sandwich tasted way too tart. I don't even like their bread, I can say with confidence it ain't up to snuff after visiting some REAL bakeries in this town.

So after looking at the menu online, I see they enjoy taking a simple breakfast/lunch food and spicing it up a little...they shouldn't try so hard. My stomach churns at the thought of them messing up the paninis. Maybe I'll be back to try a breakfast panini, as they were pretty cheap (chicken sausage and apple? Hmm...)

Basically, there are some decent items to be had here, I'm sure. But...can you find a better brunch or sandwich for around $10? If you're on Yelp, you already should have. The food is 'meh', but at least the service is great. And that black currant tea. I want a tank to myself."}
{"text":"Good portions for the pick 2. Got the club panini, really good but just a little heavy on the mayo, and pasta dish for my son, forgot which one. Husband got cafe salad and was at little pricey for the portion. Will likely return to the other items."}
{"text":"I've spent HUNDREDS, maybe even thousands on catering with these guys and each & every time I try to give them another chance they screw up. Today was no different arrived an hour and 15 mins late for a lunch meeting that I intentionally placed an order to have delivered 30 mins prior just in case they were late, no call to inform me they were on the way or running late...nothing, I had to call them - 4 times. By the time my group got their food - the meeting was over. Called afterwards to speak with the catering manager and was told she wasn't in so they took my info for a call back....called back and she's gone for the day.

At this rate they won't be there long and they've lost a huge book of business from me. I'm not going to say beware, I'm saying DON'T BOTHER AT ALL."}
{"text":"2nd time I have tried this place for a quick snack.  One time for a croissant and hot tea. This recent time was for a pumpkin muffin and iced tea. Both times great customer service - no wait time and moist bakery snacks.  I am a sucker for anything pumpkin but this was one of the moistest and flavorful muffins I have had in a long time. Will continue to visit this place. Hit the spot"}
{"text":"okay service okay food okay atmosphere really good prices. I had the choose 2 with a salad and sandwich. their coffee selection is great, and ingredients are fresh but nothing very impressive about the place."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here today and overall it was pretty enjoyable. Restaurant has really open seating and isn't very loud so it makes for easy conversation. The food was good and I definitely enjoyed it, but I wouldn't call it great by any means. When we were in line the manager (or maybe owner) came and offered us a free cookie while we waited which I though was a pretty unique and nice thing to do. The rest of the staff was also really friendly, so I will most likely eat here again."}
{"text":"My friend and I were walking back to the car from an event at Tempe Beach Park, and we saw this place had a patio, figured it wouldn't hurt to ask if they allow dogs (they do!!) - so took a table outside. The staff were so attentive and friendly, and even brought both of my dogs their own disposable water bowls!! On top of all that, the food was excellent. The eggs actually had the cheese scrambled in them (#win), the breakfast potatoes had the perfect flavor - and they were super fast. I will definitely be returning, with or without my fur babies!!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed by my latest experience here. This place can be so good, but today's experience was horrible. First, as I approached the counter to give my order, a person who I believe was the manager because he was dressed differently than the other workers, cut right in front of me to reach over the counter to grab two empty cups. Then as I gave my order to the less than enthusiastic girl taking orders I had specific changes to certain items. I ordered the chopped salad and request no blue cheese and I wanted ranch dressing on the side because I did not want the spicy vinaigrette that came on the salad. She informed me that they did not have ranch dressing. WHAT?!?  The most popular dressing they don't even have. So I asked what dressings they had.  She said the one that was probably closest to ranch was their house dressing because it is creamy, which seemed reasonable so that is what I requested. I also ordered a bbq flat bread that came with a side salad and carrots. The flatbread had picked onions on it so I requested that they leave those off. When the order was delivered, the flatbread had the onions on it and the carrots were very dry. I am attaching a picture of them for reference. In addition, the dressing that was delivered was not creamy at all and in fact was some sort of vinaigrette. I tasted it and it tasted like what I thought spicy vinaigrette would taste like so I thought they just forgot to switch it out to the house dressing so I requested house dressing from the guy that delivered the meal. Since I had a side salad on my plate and had also requested the house dressing but received what I thought was the spicy vinaigrette I walked up to the order counter to request house dressing for myself. The guy that was getting the house dressing for mad that I was up there and snapped at me telling me that he was getting my dressing so I explained that I needed some too. Well when the \"house\" dressing was delivered it looked exactly  like the spicy vinaigrette that we already had. So we asked what kind of dressing they had hat was cream and they told us avocado ranch so we requested that. Although it was better than the spicy vinaigrette, it was still not regular ranch. I was very disappointed in the demeanor of the workers there, especially because it was not just one person - it was three. I would have given this review one star but I know it can be good."}
{"text":"Tried ordering online and the system wouldn't work after multiple attempts. Decided to go in and when I ordered a soup in a bread bowl like was listed online they didn't bother to tell me the location didn't serve it. Instead I paid for an order I didn't actually want without me knowing. Communication is key."}
{"text":"I visited at about 5 o'clock on a Friday, and the place was mercifully empty. I ordered a large chicken berry pecan salad to go. I was told it'd be about 20 minutes, which stunned me. She told me it'd probably be faster than that. I was still willing to wait rather than walk somewhere else. I really wanted a nice salad after a day at the convention center! I sat down, and not even one minute later, my name was called. Everything was included--a lovely salad, dressing in a sealed cup, a wrapped piece of bread, and a sealed utensil set. I carried it across the street to my hotel room, and oh, the salad was so good. Everything was fresh and the flavors melded in a great way. This salad was a seasonal offering, and a mighty fine one at that."}
{"text":"Whenever I walk into this Corner Bakery Cafe, I thank my lucky stars that they decided to locate here at the Arizona Center. Previously, the only choice for a quick lunchtime sandwich/meal-to-go was Subway, and one can only tolerate that grub for so long. To this day, I cannot stand to walk into a Subway without getting a little bit nauseated.

So Corner Bakery Cafe fills the sandwich/salad/soup niche quite impressively. I usually get their grilled paninis which are perfectly crunchy and delicious. I also like the customer service here as they really try to greet you with a smile. Their Cinnamon Creme Cake is also truly indulgent--I was blown away when someone brought this to work and we stuffed our faces during a meeting. Shove this in your cake-hole and you won't be disappointed.

My only criticism is the Turkey on Pretzel Bread signature sandwich was not 100% to my liking. I feel that the bread could've been a bit thinner or softer, as not to take away from the other sandwich ingredients. And although it might've been due to the fact that this place was brand-new and hadn't worked all of the kinks out, I detected an off-taste that was a little bit chemical in nature. Maybe the bread, after baking, was wrapped too soon in plastic wrap--or something, but it was a little unappetizing. Other than that, I feel that Corner Bakery Cafe can do no wrong. I love coming to this place for lunch and consider them a welcome resident of the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place for the first time! I ordered the Chicken Ceasar Salad. It was delicious and It was very reasonably priced! The atmosphere is great! I would come back here to eat. The only downfall is that they have limited hours. Can't wait to come here again and try something else!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for breakfast.  Very kid friendly.   Staff gave us ingredients list to check for allergies for our son.  They were super helpful and very friendly.   Food was good and quick.  Good breakfast menu from savory to sweet foods.   Would recommend this for sure."}
{"text":"I'm not being biased here when I say that this is a great place to stop in and eat lunch! The outside patio has to be my favorite! Everybody there is friendly attentive and always cheerful. The food seriously tastes homemade and is completely fresh from Kitchen to table with hearty helpings in each dish! Don't even get me started on the desserts there let's just say there's a pan of sweet rolls that come out often nice creamy & warm.. I just want to lay in them and eat frosting all day! Definitely worth the try to stop on in XO!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner during their grand opening. Wasn't busy, everyone was very attentive and nice. I got the choose 2 with the club panini and the pesto pasta and both were great. Very large portion, especially the pasta. Also came with a pickle and chips so it really was a ton of food. Love that they have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Holy moly... this place is delicious! And Well-priced. You order at the counter & they bring the food to your table. Shoutout to JAYLYN. She was so sweet when she brought our food to our table & attentive. It's kinda like semi-fast food but waaaay better & so FRESH!! I had the Anaheim Panini with the bacon on the side (I don't eat meat so I gave it to my friend to put extra on her sammy). She got the power flat avocado spinach & she said it's the bomb.com. It cost us for 2 coffees & 2 breakfast sammys $12. 

Will definitely be back!!! Thanks."}
{"text":"First time at this location, being in Scottsdale and all I had high hopes that maybe CB would step up its game. And was hoping for a quick soup and salad place that would give Panera Bread some competition. Sadly, it remains elusive. I had chicken noodle soup (not bad, a little salty but lots of chicken and carrots in a deeper broth  than PB) and a harvest salad which left me neither satisfied nor totally dissatisfied. It came with bleu cheese, Granny Smith apple slices(maybe 4 thin slices) a few walnuts, dried blueberries(?), harvest croutons and a light dressing. Overall, not bad but it lacked presentation and I didn't find the cheese until I moved the bread, which sounds nit picky but I think this salad could have been plated better. You are, like it or not, competing in a part of town run amuck with restaurant choices. For the price, almost $15 with small drink, this wouldn't be mine."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time.  We found the service to be exceptional!  We were asked 3 times how everything was and if we needed anything!  Now thats good service.  I had the turkey avocado sandwich and switched to sourdough bread.  OMG that is the yummiest bread I have had in a long time!  They also have this AMAZING hibiscus lemonaide.  I highly recommend you try this place.  We are going back just for the bread and lemonaide!!!"}
{"text":"Panera?  Paradise?  Wildflower?  Corner Bakery?  I would rank them:

1. Wildflower
2. ?
3. ?
4. Panera
5. Corner Bakery
6. Paradise Bakery

This is of course only a ranking of these upscale concept sort of places where you can order things like soup or salad & half a sandwich and a muffin or cookie.

And you can pull out your laptop and use free wifi (often what brings me in)."}
{"text":"Service was pretty mediocre, but the food was excellent. I got the uptown turkey and the broccoli cheddar soup, and it was JUST what I was craving for lunch. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Food is always so fresh and delicious! Quality of ingredients is exceptional too. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Definitely going to add them to my lunch routine."}
{"text":"There wasn't that much to brag about here. Basic menu , Coffee was much to be desired. If you can't get coffee right in a bakery cafe you've got some work to do. Ok in a pinch..."}
{"text":"Good is awful, they over cook eggs, breads are not toasted well, potatoes are hard and not cooked with pepper and onions at all. Awful awful"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is really yummayy! Tomato basil soup is fantastic, holy diver!"}
{"text":"Great little café right off the 101 & P83can't wait to come back and looks nice, good choices & good food !!! great Coffee"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and, unfortunately, I've never been super impressed by the food. 

I had a 1/2 n' 1/2 combo with the Uptown Turkey sandwich and Broccoli soup today. It was just okay. The bread was very rough and tore up the roof of my mouth a bit. I don't know if that's because it was old or just the bread, but I would imagine bread should just be soft regardless, right? I don't know, given that I've been here more than once with a similar experience, I'd say I'm not really a fan.

This location IS nice as far as service, decor, cleanliness, etc., but I wouldn't come here if you're wanting amazing food. It's sub-par at best."}
{"text":"Have been waiting for the Corner Bakery Cafe to open since they broke ground. Great place.  The menu online looked excellent. This was my first time there and I was hungry so I had high expectations. I wasn't disappointed. 

The breakfast items also sound delicious. 

I had the Chicken Pesto on a Baguette. Very good. The bread was fresh, the chicken was flavorful and the pesto topping was excellent. 

It was very busy but they prepared the food very fast. 

I can't wait to go back with my wife. This will one of our go-to spots. The menu is large enough it will be a while before we have tried most of the items."}
{"text":"The prices are a little bit high, but the food is great. You probably get what you pay for because it is not a run-of-the-mill type of lunch place."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as it has a drive-thru and I had a baby in the car. When I got my order (trio salad) I noticed it was a very small portion. Compared to Panera or Cafe Zupas it was literally half the size for the same price. And to be honest it wasn't anything that special. Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened here! Utensils were wet. Potatoes were raw and my omelet was watery. The staff were helpful in replacing the potatoes with fruit salad but the fruit salad tasted old and stale! I have been to this location and never had these many issues."}
{"text":"I'm glad to see one has opened up in Henderson. They have great healthy choices. If you are on a diet, training for a sport or competition, or just simply need to grab a bite, just drop in. Make sure anything you order you request for dressing and sauces on the side. Better way to control your calories.  One of the pasta dishes has loads of sauce...a bowl full of sauce. I'm sure it tastes great, but it tastes good even without so much of it. So request for it on the side...you'll see what I mean. 

Staff is friendly, places is cute and clean. Stop in and grab something to eat. It's another great addition to the plethora of restaurants on Stephanie St and that whole area."}
{"text":"I recently went to this location and enjoyed a great breakfast. Unfortunately, shortly there after mystery charges started appearing on my debit card. It is the only place I utilized my debit card recently, so I am positive it was them. Thank god the bank straightened it all out and I got my money back, but I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Came in on a beautfiul Sunday afternoon. Place was beginning to get full. This place turned out to be a great looking ambient! I used to drive by when it was under construction. I ordered the Asian Pork Sandwich along with the Tomato Basil soup. The sandwich is a bit small, could use a little more zing and spice. It sucks that they probably wont do it though because of the demographics in this area. The soup was delicious nice strong tomato taste. I am curious as to how they make their soups...I really hope they are not just buying canned soups and heating them up. 
There was a mistake made in my order but was taken care of right away by my server Liz. She was very hasty and attentive to my order. Annie came around to make sure everything turned out the way I wanted it. They were both very nice and caring. I am glad to have come here seeing and feeling that caring touch towards the customer will definitely bring me back here!! Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"I had this café bookmarked for the longest time but it always seemed so far away. While heading out of Vegas, I finally got to visit this Cafe while looking for a place to eat using yelp. I was happy to discover they had a drive thru! The restaurant menu was full of relatively healthy food like soup and sandwiches. This was awesome because I didn't want anything too heavy. The staff seemed very friendly and had patience while we decided what to order. I ordered the chicken Pomodoro Panini. My brother ordered the meatball Panini. The sandwiches were actually pretty good! We also loved getting free chips with our order. We'll definitely be back. hopefully to try their bakery treats people rave about."}
{"text":"My first time here and I did an online order. It took five minutes for someone to even acknowledge me standing at the pick up counter when there were two people standing at the register. Took 15 minutes to make my order when I was the only one there and four people working behind the counter. I don't think the best food in the world is worth coming back."}
{"text":"I don't
Know what happened . This place opened up months ago I always get the southwest salad and usually great.. And it always had chicken without me adding it. So today I get the same thing .. But totally different . Plopped salad on a plate overloaded with pickled jalapeños no chicken and no little piece o breadI asked for the chicken it came but super chilled . I dunno what happened but I can't see paying 9 +for a salad like that w/chicken"}
{"text":"First time I went here I placed a take out order.  Let me state this: I'm surprised I returned yesterday for lunch.  
Lunch yesterday: was by far a better experience than the first.   Jayla, whom brought our orders was a ray of sunshine!  She immediately made the corrections and followed up quite often:).  Food was fresh, not very fresh- but good.  It came out in a decent amount of time, however not 'piping hot', but no cold either.  Pastries in my opinion are some what dry, if I do return for a third (three times a charm) I don't believe I would make a go of the pastries.  Believe me, I clearly have a sweet tooth!  Have you seen my Yelp and Instagram pictures;) 
Bonus here are the fluids so Coffee, teas, lemonades- yes, refreshments.  Those are tasty (except I do prefer Pepsi).  I'm about the half and half: ice tea and mix it up with lemonade aka Arnold Palmer)."}
{"text":"Horrible. Never go here. 
The atmosphere is ok but it's just like any other quick service chain restaurant, except it seemed over staffed but that didn't help with the food quality or time it took to get our food. 

Three of us decided to get breakfast one morning and spent over 40 dollars on stuff that would have cost less than 20 at Denny's, and more like 5-8 dollars at Safeway. 

My '12 ounce Americano with room for cream' was filled up just a little past the 4 ounce point. I had to send it back because it's not what I ordered and my friend sent back her Carmel latté. 

All our food was cold and took a long time to get to our table, not to mention it was bland and flavorless. How do you mess up 10 dollar eggs, fruit and toast? I'm not sure, but they managed to pull it off. 

SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME. GROSS. SAD. EXPENSIVE. SLOW."}
{"text":"This was FANTASTIC! I loved the Anaheim scramble, and they were out of oatmeal which my mom was craving. The manager was kind enough to bring her a portion of oatmeal at the end of our meal! AMAZING customer service - just exceptional everyone went above and beyond! Also I LOVE their coffee and so many flavors to choose and enjoy! We will add this place to our regular breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast but man was it delicious! Service was friendly and accommodating, food is very good, especially for the price! Would definitely recommend. Comes with a hip, calm atmosphere fit for all ages. Could definitely bring the old textbooks here and kick it."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this bakery since it opened. Finally got my way in and to my disappointment breakfast was Over and lunch with now being served. I ordered a chicken sandwich with broccoli cheddar soup.    The sandwich was OK and the soup was a little watery. I could see how people would like corner bakery but to me it was a notch down from Panera. I left unsatisfied and still hungry. Unfortunately I will not be back"}
{"text":"Ok for what it is. The spinach salad was good, and all elements appeared fresh. The chicken pomodori panini was really soggy on the bottom where it should have been crispy, indicating it was premade instead of freshly pressed."}
{"text":"Was craving something sweet on a Sunday but most bakery's are closed Sunday's so I sent the hubby here. The chocolate chip cookie was as hard as a rock and the blueberry pastry was pretty flavorless. Wish it was better as it's conveniently located and open when most places aren't."}
{"text":"Have used the catering services twice now, once for breakfast and once for lunch. Both times the food was outstanding! The fruit plate was nice and fresh, the muffin & bagel basket offered a nice variety. The mini lunch sandwiches were tasty along with the veggie spread and cavatappi pasta salad. The sweets basket was fantastic and loved by everyone in the office - especially the pecan bars! Highly recommend for any of your office events or meetings!"}
{"text":"Hey morning coffee and pastry chasers! If you're looking for a great hot fresh roasted coffee or decadent desserts, then prepare to gamble (Vegas style) because this place has more odds than a roulette table with a $5 buy in! And they are not in your favor 

They are inconsistent at the places that matter most. Having some background here in the cafe bistro style restaurant, I met the most amount of dissatisfaction I could have for my morning solution with the family. 

The coffees are always out and as I try to stay mindful of bad eats - reaching for the Raw Cane Sugar was a big mistake today because why? Surprise surprise, they are out! When I asked the employee serving the dining room if there were more, she simply replied with \"I think people steal them and we are always out\". 

Well then, be it as it may, that's probably one of the best, worst answers I've ever heard. Not really wanting to start my day off with a less than satisfying coffee I decided to simply return the cup and ask for my money back - since Starbucks and Panera are right around the corner, I knew my odds would greatly increase in my favor. Did I want to go to a second place for coffee? Absolutely not, but that's how this Corner Bakery rolls - turning away business. 

It gets better... 

As I'm waiting for the refund, my meal comes. Let's just say, their sandwiches, power flats and breakfast plates (for the price they charge) are embarrassing. The sad part of it is, I've been to countless Corner Bakeries in Texas, and this has never been the case. I guess what they say is true, everything is bigger in Texas, including your food! 

On top of that you pay $1.00 extra for potatoes... as you can see from the picture, someone thought it would be clever to spread out these cold and withered potatoes as to give the allure that many are there. 

Save your money folks, this is strike two for me and definitely not going to have my business going further. In fact, I'd like to poise that there is a breakfast solution that is amazing in the same parking lot called \"Baby Stacks\" and a Panera right around the corner. And this is how your competition pushes you out. Especially in a hospitality town."}
{"text":"Best place ever, super excited they open one in Vegas, I'm from San Diego and used to go here a lot. Always great"}
{"text":"If you like Panera Bread or Cafe Zupas, you might like Corner Bakery...unless you're like me and you won't.
First of all, not sure if they have their on line preordering system down. I walk in and there's no sign of what to do since I already ordered and paid, lucky a worker was near the door so I asked her and she walked me up to the front but didn't tell the cashier why I was there so he continued to take people from the just ordered line, I snuck in quick before he took another and said I needed my order. The bag was sitting there, he asks if I got my soda or cake yet...what!? Shouldn't my cup and cake be with my order, why and how would I already have it. Are there instructions somewhere that I missed on how this whole thing works here??
Everyone was really nice though. It was lunchtime so every table was full with a line out the door.
On to the food, I couldn't bite or cut my Club Panini, the bread was over toasted. The Sweet Spinach Crunch Salad was good but nothing special. The saving grace was my slice of Cinnamon Creme cake, I'd go back for the cake.
 Prices were similar to other soup, salad, sandwich places. Cafe was kept clean even with the crowd."}
{"text":"So to be honest this review is jaded because I went here to have dinner at 6:15 pm this evening and it was closed. Everything I found online said they close at 7pm. Signage says its a breakfast, lunch, and dinner spot. I could not find hours posted on site, but pretty crazy to close at 6pm on a Friday and call themselves a dinner spot. Crazy town if you ask me."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! It has a drive through and decorated very well. The food is amazing!!! The chicken noodle soup was perfect. It wasn't soggy or over seasoned. Definitely real chicken. I had the uptown turkey avocado and it was picture perfect. The side salad was a little small but the Cesar dressing and croutons were worth it. The hubby had a meatball panini with loaded baked potato soup. All he could manage was that it was \"f*cking amazing.\" They also have the good crayola crayons for your kiddo. Absolutely check this place out. Hope the quality lasts - will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Always love this place when we're visiting.  Polite staff, but Ricardo couldn't be better.  Wonderful service and great guy.  Thank you, Ricardo"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw the Coming Soon sign during construction having been to other Corner Bakery's in other states! I've eaten here twice since it opened and both times were great! Food is really fresh and well prepared. Place is overly staffed with employees that seem happy working there and are trying very hard to make everything to perfection! Prices are similar to Zupas and Panera but Corner has a drive-thru, which is a big win for me when I want healthy food and don't want to change out of my P.J.s! Will definitely make this place a regular stop!"}
{"text":"I think I ordered the wrong thing because my sandwich was pretty blah, especially for the price. I was disappointed because the cashier actually recommended it to me too. The atmosphere is really cute though! Clean and easy menu to navigate. I'll go back, but choose something other than a panini."}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here a few times. The food is decent, although I did not like the sandwich I chose today. The service seems good and long lines tend to move quickly during lunch. I guess I was just a little disappointed with the chicken poblano sandwich and chicken noodle soup. I didn't like the taste of the sandwich- too citrusy and the soup was boring. The chicken said it was grilled and it was cold and kind of wet. I didn't like the texture. I will probably give them another shot in the future. Maybe I'll stick to the sweets they offer, which are delicious!"}
{"text":"Hard to find a better salad.  Really nice selection of items and you get a pretty decent amount of food for your money.  Good service, good atmosphere, clean, and the teas they have are delicious.  I've been there 4-5 times already, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Happy!

I remember when they first opened here. The menu pricing for lunch seemed high for the portion size. I hadn't been to a Corner Bakery in many, many years recalling I thought their lunches back then were pricey for the portions.

I was there this morning to grab a breakfast panini to go. Hunger won out and this was the place that I was in front of at the time.

Beck was the server. She was quirky and friendly just like the nickname \"Beck\" might imply. 

Kitchen service was quick. Order prepared just right. Well cooked. Bacon not burnt nor fatty. Yum. Generous amount of scrambled egg. I should have studied the menu closer as I realized the loaded panini includes avocado, tomato and onion for only 50 cents more. Next time.

For less than $6, a reasonably sized breakfast at something around 600 calories. Much better and healthier than a 2-fer from a golden national fast food franchise nearby."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a popular stop for all the office workers and students in the area. Most recently I came here for breakfast with Rob W. 

Service: The servers were friendly, but didn't really offer any advice or suggestions. I would have appreciated a couple suggestions as their menu is extensive. They seemed more keen to chat amongst themselves. 

Food: we ordered the seasonal oatmeal and a yogurt parfait to go. The yogurt was fine, but oh my gosh, that oatmeal could've fed a family of five with absolutely no problem. It was super hearty and offered more oatmeal than I think I actually paid for. It was topped with walnuts and whipped cream. 

Atmosphere: this restaurant offers a lot of seating area. 

I'll probably be back once school is in session to try their lunch offerings. Hopefully the construction in the area will be completed by then."}
{"text":"I came here for the reviews. The place was nice and well kept minus the ceiling fans with a collection of dust that has never been cleaned in awhile. I ordered the Apple cranberry oatmeal, salted caramel latte and a everything bagel toasted with cream cheese to go. 20 minutes later I received my order with an apology. My everything bagel wasn't toasted, my oatmeal was Luke warm plus it was the wrong oatmeal I ordered, the cup was half full too. My latte was caramel and not the salted caramel I ordered. The signs and promotion for the oatmeal and latte are all over the restaurant. I am so disappointed with this place. I hope others have a better experience."}
{"text":"Driven past this place for years and was put off by the odd location, stepping inside today I never thought it would be as posh and inviting as it was. The cashiers were very polite and friendly and the menu looked incredible.

I ordered a spinach avocado flat and waited a good amount of time. Maybe i was just hungry and growing impatient in anticipation. Finally a large unenthusiastic compadre in the back with clear disdain for his role as chef tossed a sloppily wrapped sandwich onto the warming table. I knew it had to be mine.

I took my sandwich and prepared to indulge. I knew i had to shake off some of the negative vibes from the sandwich since esse in the back clearly wasn't having a good day and was instilling the food with his hate and disdain for his job.

After that was taken care of i bit into heaven with a perfect cheesy flavor combination of eggs avo and cheeses. Delightful. Minus the big amigo in the back. Didn't appreciate that ..."}
{"text":"We just tried this place for lunch and loved it! The service was friendly and fast and the place is very clean. We ordered the \"Choose Any 2\" combos and the portions were large. We loved all the food (chopped salad, cheddar broccoli soup, and mac and three cheese pasta). We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very excited you guys are here in Las Vegas
Miss the tomato soup my favourite and sandwich selection is great 
Friendly staff very clean 
Although I need to complain I told your cashier I burned my hand opening your door Sunday evening at 530pm the metal heating up all day please put a cover on there"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Great service, and I love that they topped my soup with some bread :)"}
{"text":"Now I know why this place had so few stars. To start, this is the 3rd time we have tried this cafe. When we arrived just before 6pm it seemed strange there was only one other person in the cafe at dinner time for so many. First impression should have told us to leave. The cafe did look clean so I gave it one star for that. We Couldn't get the sandwich we wanted because they were out of chicken. Ok, no big deal, had turkey instead. $18.00. Seemed a little high for two sandwiches and a cup of soup when I saw the sizes of the servings we were brought.  I almost ducked as the server plunked our food on the table and walked away without a comment. With four of us at the table it was a shuffle as we had to figure out what was what and who got what. The servers attitude and sour face told us she didn't want to be there and wished we would leave also. My sandwich looked like a child's size sandwich and came without any dressing or flavor. The cup of soup wasn't hot but the other grilled sandwich was. So now I know why so few stars. I won't be back. It's a shame this restaurant isn't acceptable because it's cute and in a nice busy area. 
Oh, I forgot, they were out of the bread my sandwich was suppose to be on."}
{"text":"Walked in place was almost empty and almost every table was dirty. My friend ordered soup, I ordered soup and sandwich. They delivered my soup and sandwich in and very polite then they proceeded to tell my friend that they were out of the soup that she ordered and asked if she would like something else. She switch soups and then waited and waited . I finished my meal and she waited and then she finally went up and looked in her soup was waiting at the counter to be delivered. I've been to other corner bakery's and really enjoyed them was just disappointed at this one."}
{"text":"Just average.  I personally think it is over priced for what you get.  Do not get the kale caesar salad if you are expecting to get kale.  I ordered this once for lunch for takeout.  The server handed me my salad (after a very long wait) and said \"Caesar salad\" to which I replied - I ordered the kale Caesar.  So she apologized and took it back.  When I got back to my desk to eat, it was basically a regular Caesar salad with a handful of kale on top.  I don't know if it was because they messed up the order to begin with and \"fixing it\" just meant putting some kale on it or if that is how it just comes, but I'm not going to try it again.  The bread on the sandwiches is not very good (Paradise Bakery bread is much better).  Cookies are not very good - again Paradise Bakery cookies much better.  But, then I found an item I loved for breakfast.  A little breakfast power Panini.  Perfect.  I would go there just for that.  They've discontinued it and replaced it with flat bread.  When I mentioned I was disappointed, they were like \"well it's the same thing\" - um no, it's not.  I almost turned and left but I was hungry so I ordered another Panini.  I wasn't going to eat the bread anyway but it was very soggy.  Aren't Panini's supposed to be toasty?"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a quick lunch when you are in a hurry. I have come to this location a few times during the lunch rush. I am not at all a healthy eater, so I immediately order their pastas. I love their Mac n cheese, very tasty, but it will definitely put you in food coma.
I've tried some of their pastries as well and they have been okay."}
{"text":"\"I would go back but it wasn't anything spectacular\" was what my fiancé and I both agreed on.

It's like a glorified Paradise Bakery with a very similar menu and restaurant layout. 

When I have gone back, the food quality was inconsistent. Flavors have always been different while I still order the same thing... It's just hit or miss from what I've experienced.

The service is great. They clean your table quickly and (sometimes) you get your food rather fast. Yet, I have ordered a panini and it took 30 minutes for my Togo order which I felt was rather ridiculous. 

I only come here if I'm feeling like a brisk walk from Scottsdale quarter on my lunch break. I wouldn't make a trip down here for any other reason.
I'll stick with C3 sandwiches."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly satisfied to find this restaurant today as I wanted to eat something quick and delicious. I ordered the spinach salad which was filled with various fruits and so tasty and I ordered a homemade blueberry frosted turnover type dessert that was out of the world. the homemade soup was delicious.  I had no complaints the price was very reasonable the servers were friendly and helpful and the food was excellent. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This place is super cute ! Their harvest salad is awesome ! Trinity , the cashier was very nice and helpful - way to go !!"}
{"text":"Love this cafe it's quick and delicious and portion sized if need be, they also have a great hibiscus lemonade which is fresh! I will be back again to eat here and be a regular"}
{"text":"1st time here to check out this place. Its quick and easy. Order at counter and theyll bring it out to you. A few selections of coffee anf drinks.  I got the bakers blend which was decent cup o Joe. We both got the Anaheim panini that was tasty and a side of fruit which had a nice variety unlike some places. Would like to try some of their pastries next time."}
{"text":"Went to the Corner Bakery Cafe for the first time. I had really high expectations after reading all the positive reviews. I decided to do a take out order, which I normally don't do visiting a place for the first time.

I ordered a Turkey Sandwich with bacon on a Pretzel Bun. When I went to pick up the order I was told there was no Provolone cheese. I was okay with it. I also ordered a Chicken Pomodori, soup and some desserts. Before leaving, I had to remind the staff to give me my order of chips. No big deal. Once I got home, it was a different story. The turkey sandwich I ordered had no turkey and was nothing but bacon! Really! I open the Chicken Pomodori and it was completely burnt and smelt burnt. The soup was mediocre. The cookies however were great!

I called to speak with a manager. After sitting on hold for 12 minutes, I was finally able to speak with the manager. Mandi was very apologetic and offered to redo the entire meal. She offered me gift certificates and to comp my entire meal. I asked to have to two items removed from the bill and pay for the rest. She took my information and asked me to come back to resolve the issues. Needless to say, my interaction with the manager was the only positive from this experience."}
{"text":"Tried this place today. Outstanding!
First, the facility is really nice, best in class among \"bakery cafes\" I've visited. I brought a client so it was great that it had an \"upscale\" vibe.. They have great wi-fi and power at every table from what I could see.
The people were really friendly. I was greeted with a smile and courtesy. I noticed a sign in front pushing their pancakes. I told the cashier that I wished it was breakfast because I wouldn't mind trying them. She told me that they serve the whole menu, breakfast, lunch, or dinner all-day, so I could have pancakes for lunch if I wanted. 
It was a good call. I had the combo which served up more pancakes, eggs, bacon, and syrup than I could eat. It was delicious. The eggs were really fluffy.
My guest had the Chicken Pomodori sandwich with a fresh fruit cup and was very pleased.
We sat inside but their patio is very nice. 
This may become my new office:-))"}
{"text":"Okay, I confess I'm a Corner Bakery fan.  Had the Chicken Pomodori panini and Lemon Orzo soup. Both were outstanding.

Staff was friendly and attentive. Nice facility and patio."}
{"text":"First time I've gone to the Tempe location. Food, cleanliness, and service is excellent.
Note: I got Mac n Cheese which they used to top with bread crumbs automatically (which were then toasted); now you need to request them (no charge). I think the bread crumbs add a lot to the dish.

Interestingly, I got out cheaper than when I ate at Carl's Jr. on Saturday."}
{"text":"Never again. 

We wanted to try something new for dinner last night that was quick and somewhat healthier. 

We saw that Corner Bakery was still open for 30 minutes so we headed over. Upon walking in we saw that it was dead. There were 2 associates visible up by the counter and one in the back cooking. The one up at the counter was eating something out of a bag behind the counter. She came over to take our order like we were interrupting her, no greeting just \"what can I get you?\"

We ordered, paid, and before getting to our table she calls back and says they are out of bacon, which both sandwiches we order feature bacon. The cook is standing there next to her (while she is texting on her phone) offering to make us something else, he suggested pasta. Why pasta when we ordered sandwiches? Whatever, changed the orders disappointedly. 

Before finding a table we are stopped by another associate who made us aware they had closed off most of the restaurant, guessing as they cleaned it already for closing. I cannot stand places that treat times they are STILL OPEN as if it is closed. Certain foods are unavailable, or old, and service is lacking because they are focused on closing practices. Goes to show their values and business practices. 

They bring our food and they have one extra panini that we had changed just minutes before due to them being out of bacon - seriously? He got a pesto chicken sandwich and a chopped salad, which the iceberg lettuce was so gross looking and old that he didn't even touch it. The bread on his sandwich was so hard he just ate the middle. 

My panini was okay, but had a weird after taste. The California something panini with zucchini and pesto and artichoke hearts. I couldn't finish it. I also ordered the lemon orzo soup - old. Everything was so soggy and like it came from a can. We used it to dip the bread in it but it was dipping one bad food into another, so we were done. 

We finally saw a manager walking around checking on the associates and we were going to offer feedback, but after what we had seen, we knew it didn't matter. This subpar staff with subpar standards and service is not going to care, they just want to go home and SO DID WE."}
{"text":"I personally loved it here . My daughter and I went for the first time today before her gymnastics class and the staff was very friendly. I also received our food fast and it was amazing ."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Corner Bakery. I am not familiar with the chain and we have now been in a few times.

Everything I've had has been delicious - soup, salad, sandwiches and the mac n cheese have all been good.

I love the service! Everyone is really helpful and friendly and I like that they deliver your food to your table for you. We've also had the staff offer to refill our drinks as well, which is nice.

Yes, it's fast food. Yes, it's a chain. But it's something different and a bit healthier and I think it's worth trying."}
{"text":"The food is pretty on par with panera or any other type of place like this; the worst part about this store is that they lie and say they close at 7pm but they always lock their doors LATEST at 6 pm and some days as early as 5:45 pm!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to the Corner Bakery for awhile and now I find myself here the second time this week! I took 2 new friends here because where else would I take someone where it's warm, comfortable and has great food and wonderful staff? The food was delightful to look at and abundant, delicious, too. The manager came over its wasn't just a formality! His genuine warmth was apparent;he was really listening to our thoughts about the Corner Bakery!! I also like the location at 20th street. Same attention to all the details that show you really care about making the Corner Bakery my first choice for taking people I want to impress with Arizona culinary excellence as well as just my go to place for a delicious treat."}
{"text":"An amazing family owned and run eatery you will not want to miss. The Biltmore area is the latest addition and I was there for the opening! The food was coming out of the kitchen in steady fashion as I spoke with Jim and Crystal about the custom nature of the food offerings. Here you get it the way you want it not just the way corporate deems it should be prepared. My favorite employee I must admit is Michele. Josh is so cute. Oh, they're all excited about making CBC the good place for us folks. You did it. I love this place and you will too!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly however.... 

I had the cobb salad, I would have liked a little more toppings it listed a lot but it was mostly lettuce and tomato's.it had about 3 blue cheese crumbs and one or 2 slices of avocado. I was expecting a hardy salad but left  hungry. I probably wouldn't get that salad again. A few friends I was with had sandwiches which looked better. I ordered extra dressing on my salad, it still came pretty dry had to ask for more dressing. Other than that it was an okay experience. I would possibly try a sandwich if I ever decide to return."}
{"text":"Located across the street from a major hotel, you would think they would want to cater to their convention customers. It's 7:30 AM and they are already out of coffee. We waited 10 minutes for them to brew fresh coffee. I ordered the oatmeal and much to my surprise, it was crunchy. How difficult is it to make oatmeal? It didn't help that when those issues were raised, the staff seemed irritated and bothered."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw this cafe being built. It is such a great find in Henderson. The food is fresh and delicious.  Their soups are so good. The potato my favorite. Love the meatball panini with marinara on the side. Their pancakes are like nowhere else. You really can't go wrong. Really friendly environment with great service. Don't forget to try their fresh baked treats. Can you guess that we are regular customers?  You will be too. Try the black currant ice tea. Very refreshing"}
{"text":"I work in Downtown Phoenix have lunched here several times. When it first opened, the service was good but as of late it has fallen off. Yesterday I waited for 5 minutes at the counter and no one came out from the back to take my order so I left and ate someplace else."}
{"text":"Hungover, I dragged myself over to Corner Bakery today. It did not disappoint. I got a breakfast sammy with bacon and cheese, and a cup of coffee.

The coffee was boiling hot, which I love. The sandwich, although not as good as the ones I make, were pretty dang good. Very simple, yummy, quick and cheap. 

I'm excited to have this option just down the street for those mornings when I just don't feel like cooking or for a quick lunch spot when I run out of food at home."}
{"text":"Being from california I been to many corner bakeries. But this one seems a bit odd maybe because it's the first one in Las Vegas but they need to train the staff and cooks to step up to the franchise name"}
{"text":"This newly opened cafe is quite honestly one of the most friendly places to go and eat.  The staff always go out of their way to make sure your happy with your food and with a smile too.

The ingredients are always fresh and of the highest quality.  I love going there for breakfast and the option for choosing 2 items for dinner is a great way to taste the delicious menu!"}
{"text":"If you want boring mac & cheese, come here.

No, seriously.  I thought it wasn't possible to ever have boring mac & cheese but this place did just that.  It wasn't bad so much as it was bland and vanilla.  With a name like \"Mac & Three Cheese,\" I would expect a good deal of flavor.  What I got was some watery cheese sauce on some noodles.  Cracking some black pepper in it didn't help.  Bringing it home to toss some paprika on it didn't help.  Nothing helped!  I will say that this isn't the worst mac & cheese but I'm pretty salty for having paid $8-something on a dish so underwhelming.  My friend didn't care much for his Steak & Cheese Sandwich either.

All in all, the overall experiencing was less than stellar.  It was a slow Thursday night but multiple tables still needed to be bussed.  Service was polite but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I signed up with eClub on their website for free anniversary treats.  They had a birthday special and e-mailed a coupon, which I scanned and presented yesterday late morning.  The hostess was very polite and moved in a professional manner.  She was familiar with the coupon and directed me to select a free dessert, which was a choice of a cookie, bar, or baby cake that they had available at the time I was there.  I picked a chocolate bundt cake drizzled in vanilla glaze.  She showed me a little plate meaning was it to dine-in or to go.  I mentioned to go and was pleased that the container was a clear plastic with snap-on cover that I can recycle and wash and use over again, and not some throwaway fall-apart garbage.  Also, there was no tax.
The cake was a generous dessert portion and oh-so-moist, and the glaze was not too sweet.  In fact, I took it home and put in in my fridge for later eating and after several hours all cold, the cake was moist and didn't even dry out.
I ate there last February 2016 for their CMYE 'Power Lunch' day with Hailey as the new Yelp community manager, and when this Cafe was newly-opened at this Colonnade location and enjoyed the hospitality, ambiance, and delicious food (and remembered the yummy bundt cake I had for dessert)...
Thanks for the birthday treat :)"}
{"text":"I read mediocre reviews before trying this place, so I didn't expect a 5 star experience.  But most of the clientele I saw early Sunday morning simply wanted an inexpensive, quick breakfast.  I got a power flatbread with scrambled eggs, bacon and cheese, with side of oatmeal.  The cheese wasn't melted, eggs cold and bacon cooked hours ago.  Steel-oats were average. Coffee was fresh and hot!  All for $8.50.  Keep your expectations low, but the price is also.  They have wifi which was a plus."}
{"text":"I am familiar with Corner Bakery from other places I have lived, and was very happy to see one go in at the old Miracle Mile location in Camelback Colonnade.  I like Corner Bakery much better than Paradise.  It has great sandwiches, salads and soups, and good lunch combo options -- as well as lots of yummy treats!"}
{"text":"We ate here a few times while away on business in Scottsdale. The location is pretty close to Scottsdale quarter. If you are looking for a healthy lunch or breakfast than this can be added to your list. 

The food comes out quick and is pretty consistent. They have salads, sandwiches, soup and a variety of other lunch items. 

My only concern is the back area doesn't have a lot of air circulation and sometimes with a larger group that is your only option."}
{"text":"I parked up front like the cashier requested and waited 30 minutes for my drive-thru order. After waiting a half an hour, I ended up walking into the store to inquire about the long wait. They said the cashier had looked for my car but could not find me. I literally parked a stall off center from the exit. To add insult to injury, the manager said she could remake my food and that it would be an additional 5 minutes. No offer for a refund just some coupons to come back to their store. I'm not happy with the service I was provided. The panini was a very small portion and the pancakes were bland. Overall my first and last experience with this place left me very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"The panini sandwiches are top notch!! Tried the marinara sauce on pasta though, and...meh. I'd skip that next time. Really good value for the $$, especially if you you have a coupon also!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience! If I could give negative stars I would say -5! I could not place my order completely because the woman cashier was too busy having a personal conversation in Spanish with another worker. When I asked for. Lemon bar she gave me pound cake again I ask for a \"lemon bar\" ! As I was watching her she begins to grab the pie! And I say just a little louder I would like a lemon bar! Pretty long ordeal for a simple order. Hopefully the service improves it really is too bad because the food is actually good. The only highlight of this visit is Jalyn!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is great. Place looked amazing compared to the places I have been in California. It was also located in a nice area and the plating of the food was great. 

I got the cold oatmeal, it was a smaller portion than I usually get in California but the food overall was above the quality I normally get in California. 

If I am feeling it and I am back in Vegas, I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, this is one of the worst places I've ever eaten at. The food was absolutely terrible and the place is just plain DIRTY.

Came here for brunch last weekend to celebrate my birthday. Since my girlfriends and I were going to a matinee of \"Girls Trip\" at the AMC next door, we figured it was a convenient place to get brunch beforehand.

I wish we'd gone somewhere else. Yikes.

We got there at noon and the floor was blatantly filthy and sticky. Our shoes made sticking noises as we walked across the floor. Yuck! Why is the floor this dirty at noon? I could understand it being dirty in one or two spots if a spill happened, but this is a fairly big establishment size wise, and I'm telling you, from the entrance to bathrooms to the back of this place, the floor was soiled and sticky ALL OVER.

Why I didn't take that as a clue and just LEAVE, I'll never be able to explain. Cue up the standard excuses- I was hungry and lazy after a weekend of birthday celebrating and just wanted to sit with my girls and grab a bite before our movie.

I ordered the Farmer's Scramble sans bacon- it was SUPPOSED to consist of: scrambled eggs with peppers, onions, tomatoes, cheddar, avocado, toast and a side of oven roasted potatoes. 

Well when I got it, there were NO potatoes. Not ONE. There was NO CHEESE. Not a shred. And the avocado? Two uber thin slices of BROWN, wilted avocado. EWW and NOOO! I didn't send it back, I didn't pass go. I ate the DRY toast (they didn't even bring butter or jelly), drank my tea, and we bounced never to return again. EVER."}
{"text":"This is an incredible restaurant. They have excellent food, and even better customer service. Rachel, the cashier, really catered to my dietary needs and was very helpful in suggesting meals. Ricardo, the manager, was kind and made sure my experience was satisfactory.

My only complaint is that the croutons are TOO SPICY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but it's still only $2 cheaper than Panera. Why is a half salad, half sandwich and small drink  $13 bucks? They have teenagers at the register, well one to be exact on a SATURDAY 2 weeks before Christmas. Needless to say I was irritated when I finally got to the register and then this girl starts breaking down a box while I'm placing my order. Why couldn't the other 8 people in the back looking busy do that? Don't need to come back here."}
{"text":"After several visits I'm losing enthusiasm for this place.  Soups can be quite good, and soup/sandwich combos are good as well - but the prices start to add up quickly for the sort of food you're getting.  Add a cookie and soft drink and you've quickly passed $10 for a simple lunch.  The little roll that comes with the soup is pathetic."}
{"text":"I went to this cafe with my husband after anxiously waiting several months for it to open up for business. Well, I got my hopes up because it really wasn't anything that great. I was expecting an ABUNDANCE of bakery goodies, but they don't have that much. I have seen better quality and selection at another bakery I go to in Sun City. All they had was two little displays of baked goods, some of which pretty tasty, like their cheesecake brownies and mini bundt cakes, but still...I wasn't that impressed. They also have a breakfast and lunch menu with things like croissant sandwiches, or scrambled eggs or french toast. The portion size is pretty small and the price is pretty affordable. It's sort of like Mcdonalds. I ordered the raisin french toast, which came with two strips of bacon, a small piece of french toast and a small cup of fruit for under $6.00. Fountain drinks are seperate and are not included in the meal, so that's another $2.00. I should of went to IHOP.

The thing that really annoyed me though, was the staff. Upon entering the cafe, I was greeted by what I assume was a hostess, although she didn't seat us because it's self-seating. She was awfully chipper and fake. She then asked us if we had ever dined there before, as if dining there and trying to figure out what to do was quantum physics or something. The cashiers were also pretty overly-chipper and it seemed insincere. I am assuming this happy attitude was only due to the place just opening. Usually all employees are, then after 6 months, they turn into disgruntled jerks. Also, when we went to get our drinks, (and also the entire time we were eating) there was a self-important looking manager talking with one of his fellow collegues rudely standing dead center in front of the soda fountain. He was polite in greeting us, but him and his collegue just would not budge from that spot and were completely blocking traffic in front of the soda machine. He just kept standing there with his little clipboard, trying to look important and discussing exciting changes and oversees of this new cafe. It was so rude. I had to keep going around him to get my drink and condiments. He was completely oblivious to his rudeness.

All in all, I doubt I'll go back here. I paid freakin' $8.00 total for some little dinky breakfast, when I could have went to Micky D's and got it for $4. Plus the staff is so phoney bologna and need to turn it down a notch."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetarian sandwich and asked to add avocados. I was charged extra $1 for it which I didn't mind. But I was disappointed ti find that there was very little avocado and they were all rotten black/brown color. This is just not acceptable. Quality is the key to a successful business."}
{"text":"Helloooo brand new cafe in Henderson. I really like you!

When you walk into this place you can tell it's new. It's very clean, their service is friendly, and the vibe is just all around happy. My friend and I both got the pick 2 combos. You can choose between either 1/2 sandwich or panini, soup, pasta, or salad.

Spinach Sweet Crisp Salad- super refreshing!

Chicken pesto sandwich- awesome portion.

Meatball panini- delicious, crunchy, meaty

Cavatappi with marinara- good portion w/yummy sauce

Everything sounds so good here, so I'm definitely going to be back multiple times. Need to try out the mac and cheese next time!"}
{"text":"This is a great place and has become part of my regular lunch rotation. They employees are all friendly and helpful and my dine-in experiences have been very positive. It is great that they have a community high-top table right by the drink station since I sometimes come here alone. They also offer the ability to order and pay online; then you can come in and pick up your food to-go and skip the line.

My favorite is the Asian chicken wonton salad. In looking at the nutritional info online, I see that it is low in calories but probably has too much sugar and salt. I guess that is why the dressing tastes so delicious! I also love that it has edamame in it too. Now that the weather has finally started getting cold, I am enjoying their soups as well. I just wish they would offer more that are non-dairy."}
{"text":"We had been shopping at Best Buy and wanted to get some brunch it being Sunday.  We went around the corner to this new place where the old deli used to be.  Very nicely remodeled and the menu was small but very innovative.  They do the same order window/bring to table as most places.  There was plenty of room both in the dining room and in the pleasant patio.  My husband got the Home style Scramble and I had pancakes and bacon.  We also had some coffee - several strengths to choose from.  All of them hot and tasty.  The food came out quickly and courteously.  The scramble was full of fresh veggies and cheese.  My pancakes nice and thin with sweet butter and fresh warm maple syrup.  Delicious!  Nice to know there is someplace nice in the area!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here frequently but have cut back due to poor service and high prices, compared to other bakery cafe's in the area.  Paradise and Wildflower are both within a mile or two (Arrowhead locations), and offer more choices.  Recently, when presented with a problem, manager on duty expressed no desire to resolve."}
{"text":"Ever been somewhere and had service that just made your morning?  A Chinese couple sat down at the booth next to me.  The server came up with their food, delivered it, and then softly asked, \"um, how do you say 'thank you' in your language?\" They told him (it's 'xie xie' though my spelling is probably off), and he smiled, bowed, and said \"xie xie.\"

His manners, his approach, and his openness were like a warm hug. He could have been brisk and to the point, he could have just said \"thank you.\" He could even have been surly. He chose to take 20 seconds and reach out to a total stranger. 

I'm not saying this makes CB the best place ever. But it sure gave me a smile at the start of a long day, and I am very grateful. In my ancestral language, \"tusen tak.\""}
{"text":"Date 12-4-1010


In the past year I have eaten in your Peoria store not less than 30 times. We use this place to meet with our friends and children. We can come in get something to eat and chat. 

Tonight my wife and I went there to eat. She ordered a bowl of tomato basil soup and I ordered the same in a bread bowl. The bread bowls just have a small divot in the top for the soup. This divot is much to small for a cup of soup and it spills into the plate. I asked if enough bread could be removes to hold the soup without it spilling onto the plate. Nothing was said. When my order was delivered to the table the person proceeded to tell me that if I wanted it that way in the future they would have to charge me for a bowl of soup instead of a cup. 

I never asked for any special consideration on the price when I ordered the soup. Would not that of not been the time to tell me that it would cost more to fix the soup the way I wanted ?? The person that delivered the soup then proceeded to lecture me on the fact that I had gotten more than I had paid for. I asked her to please leave. I had to do this twice as she continued to try and lecture. 

I did not get her name. She was about 5'8\" slim light brown hair. Probably 20 or less. I should of called for the manager but at that time I was so mad I just ate my soup and left. 

I have been eating out for many years. This is the worst service I have ever had. Maybe you think one out of 30 times in the restaurant is acceptable for bad service. I don't!!

I did write a letter to the Corporate Office.  Lets see if they care?"}
{"text":"This is a solid lunch choice. I prefer it to the other area bakery type lunch places. I was in last week and had the chopped salad and a cup of chili. Both were excellent but the salad was top notch. The friendly staff keep the tables bussed and clean. The hazelnut coffee here is very good too."}
{"text":"Nice quaint cafe restaurant that you walk into a line to the counter to order your food and they bring it out to you.

We ordered the Chicken Pomodori Panini, Cafe Spinach Sweet Crisp Chicken Salad and Steak and Cheese Hoagie. The Steak and Cheese Hoagie was good but did not knock my socks off. This past summer I was in Philadelphia and had the Philly Cheesesteak and this one was not close. 

Also had the Crum Cake which was pretty good. My wife and daughter liked the baked goods and had a good time trying the new items.

I like the waiting area with chairs and reading

The private room is nice for groups to meet and get a bite

Will be back for another round soon"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was extremely busy. Especially when there is a comicon event in town. Nevertheless, the line was moving very fast. I ordered an Asian pork sandwich. It was packed with meat with very little veggie. It tastes average. Wasn't bad...wasn't exactly tasty."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself looks very nice and modern. It has a nice patio and plenty of tables inside. We went at 8:30 on a Saturday morning and there were about 6 tables taken in the huge dining room, but there were another 5 tables with dirty dishes on them and the server sitting at a table playing on his phone instead of bussing the tables. After 10 minutes another server took away the dirty dishes but never wiped down the tables, leaving food on the tables and therefore no one is going to sit at a dirty table. The prices were average for a breakfast restaurant that \"serves\" breakfast. I'm not a big fan of ordering at a counter and then putting a number on my table for someone to deliver the food   This was a factor in my lower rating. I had the Scrambler, nothing special but my potatoes were a bit soft and had a ton of pepper on them. I wanted eggs and the only way they cook them at this place is scrambled. Is the cook really that limited? My guest had the eggs (scrambled of course),bacon and pancakes. The eggs were cooked well but the bacon was cold and the pancakes mushy. Overall a disappointment."}
