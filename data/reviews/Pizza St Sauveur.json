{"text":"Seulement 3 tables occupées quand je suis arrivé. Deux avaient terminé, la troisième attendait une salade et une pizza. Durée d'attente pour une pizza à emporter, St Sauveur small = 45minutes ! 
Pendant ce temps là, j'ai assisté aux multiples va et vient d'un habitué partant vers les toilettes et ressortant  par la cuisine en ayant de la nourriture dans ses mains. Une serveuse qui se met les doigts dans la bouche pour nettoyer ses dents et l'autres qui texte. Pour la pizza, la pâte est de type feuilletée mince et huileuse, à la garniture dégoulinante, bref ça a fini à la poubelle."}
{"text":"Meilleur Pizza à Saint-So!! La croute est incroyable, les garnitures son frais. Il n'y a pas de pizza aussi bonne que chez Pizza saint-so. Si vous êtes dans la région ou vous faites du ski, passez chez pizza st. sauveur pour un bouché!"}
{"text":"Nouvelle pizzeria dans St-Sauveur, pas mangé une pizza aussi bonne depuis très longtemps. La croûte est vraiment très spéciale. Le détour vaut vraiment le coût."}
{"text":"Bring your own beer and wine! They even provide cups for your alcohol. Casual pizza joint, plastic table cloths, two tv's showing sports, oldies music. Grab a table, then report to the cashier to order and pay; she will bring the food once it's ready.  Unlike the previous reviewer we were told this so didn't have any problems waiting. They have oils, hot sauces, and other stuff available on the sidebar you can help yourself to. 

Pizza was good, not the best we've ever had but not bad at all. We got the St-So Special which is like a meat lovers, and a margarita/vegetarian mix. Canadian style meaning thicker crust. Interestingly the put all the meat on the bottom, then all the cheese.  All the veggies go on top of that (I think after cooking)."}
{"text":"The place is in a basement I will not go there to eat but rather do a take-out.
We ordered a vegetarian pizza that had half of the toping being red onions. The pizza looked like a onion pizza. Nothing in comparison to the picture posted by the owners: no black olives or tomatoes. 
Once you take off the onions the pizza was good but nothing to say it's the best pizza of Saint-Sauveur and it's quite pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Slow, (I mean SLOW) impersonal service. Pizza is okay, but I prefer to be appreciated as a customer."}
{"text":"Ate there for the fist time today, it will definitely be my last. Pizza was mediocre at best but the real disappointment was the service, or should I say the lack of service. We sat down on the terrace and a waitress brought us plates and cutlery and we never saw her again, we were never told that we had to go inside to order. I ordered a small pepperoni pizza and French fries and asked for a couple of glasses of water, I was told that they do not provide water but I can purchase a bottle of water. I received the pizza and the waitress completely forgot about the fries. After about 20 minutes I got the fries and a huge attitude from the waitress. I would never recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a medium all-dressed pizza for delivery. Despite being good tasting, the pizza arrived with the toppings having slid off the pizza, laying on the bottom of the pizza box. We had to use a fork to \"put back\" the toppings - oh my... the bottom of the pizza was suuuuuper soggy and the toppings didn't look well cooked. 

As I was eating it with a fork & knife (because there is no way possible to eat this pizza with your hands) I was reminded of soup. 

If you like your pizza barely cooked & soupy, be sure to ask that they make the pizza well-done. 

A little disappointed as this is supposed to be the best pizza in St. Sauveur. :-/"}
