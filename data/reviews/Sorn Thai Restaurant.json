{"text":"My family goes here whenever we feel like having Thai food.  The red curry beef is great, and cold rolls are not to be missed!  Free spring rolls with take out orders too, which is nice :)"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai place in Toronto. The food is so good (and reasonably priced) and the people who work there are lovely. I went tonight for a family dinner. We all shared the chicken and shrimp pad Thai, cashew chicken and sticky rice and pad seew (not on their menu but they'll make it if you ask). It was all delicious. It's a small place and often busy, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special. It's not amazing and it's not horrible. It's just Thai  food, it's a bit on the pricy side for Thai food."}
{"text":"The best Thai I've had. And I've been to Thailand! Service is fantastic. Staff are wonderful. Excellent location in the heart of Yonge and Eg."}
{"text":"I go here pretty often. The food is great, authentic, and reasonably priced. I highly recommend the spring rolls, red curry, or spicy chicken."}
{"text":"The best thing Sorn Thai has going for it is their quick and reliable delivery. Even on busy nights (Thurs-Sunday) any order is always delivered within a very reasonable amount of time.

As a resident of the area, it is a go to staple when the mood strikes to not cook for the evening.

The quality of the product is very good - and more importantly, very consistent - which is key to a frequent diner. 

Be sure to ask for extra sauce and chopsticks when ordering, or else you end up without any!"}
{"text":"BEST Thai place in me hood! 
 I just LOVE this place! The waitresses are GREAT, the food is always spicy and I like the atmosphere.I haven't tried all the dishes (yet!) but I shor wood liketa!

My friend and I had passed this place for about 3 years and NEVER ventured in......WTF were we thinking??? So, one cold gloomy night, we tromped in for a taste!
I have been going back about every 2-3 weeks since! 
The girls are great- super big smiles and attentive. They also bring us out a big olde 'disha chili's to munch on with our \"extra- extra-spicy please\" food.
 I'm a pale-skinned, red-headed lass but I ain't  joking when I say extra spicy please! At Sorn Thai, they understand that, hence the 5 star rating! 

But have no fear if spice ain't yo thang.  I brought my Scottish bred, boiled meat and potatoes eatin' mama here and she LOVED it. Anything over a black pepper grind and she cannot handle the heat! Oh lordly.....food with taste and spicy!!!! Unheard of in a Scottish household!

I always get the tom yum gai (chicken lemon soup). It is enough for 2 to share but sometimes I WANT IT ALL!!!! There are nice juicy chicken breast slices, fat mushroom and of course extra red and green chili's floating about in my bowl of bliss.
My main dish here is the spicy chicken noodles ( with a generous sprinkling of freshly sliced thai chilies). The noodles are plentiful with onions, chicken, egg and herbs.
I've also sampled the pad thai ( a little too sweet for my liking); the glass noodles which are grrreat!;  the cashew chicken; the spring rolls; the app. combo platter; the coconut chicken soup and.......to be continued!!!

People have mention the decor....I really don't care what has been hung on a wall,,,,,I'm there to eat and chili out (heheheh). I find the place super relaxing and peaceful...unlike dem trendy =noisy,  newfangled places ya'll be yelping about!

The best thing about this place is the BUZZZZZZZ I get from eating the chili's, on my long, cold walk home I feel like I'm hover-crafting down the street!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. Been coming here for years and the staff are so friendly and accommodating, and the food never disappoints. It's the only place where I will never be willing to share an order of spring rolls. The glass noodles are also to die for. Love this place so much, a real gem."}
{"text":"We've ordered from here at least 15 times since 2005. It's consistently good. 

Whenever we're in the mood for good Thai, we drive from Etobicoke for this stuff. It's delicious. In fact, we like what we order so much that we've never ordered anything else! So this review is based on:

- Pad Thai (#21), 
- Chicken Fried Rice (#25), and 
- Spicy Chicken (#37A) 

... which totals a bit over $30 so we get free spring rolls with the order. 

Great meal  for two and you'll have leftovers which re-heat well."}
{"text":"This charming little restaurant has been a lunch time favourite of mine for over 15 years.  Lunch time portions are perfect in size and run around the 10$ range.  Very clean dining room and super friendly staff. Hot and Sour soup is my absolute fav in the city.  Little wonder it made the Joanne Kates top 100 Restaurant list."}
{"text":"Love this place! I live right around the corner and it is our first choice every time we look for take-out. We eat in often as well and have found the staff to be speedy and friendly and have never been disappointed. Our favourite dishes are the fried calamari, pad thai (obviously!), basil chicken fried rice, garlic shrimp, cashew nut vegetables, and the lemon shrimp soup. We order those dishes all the time and have never been disappointed. Not too greasy and crazy delicious!! Definitely give this restaurant a try, even if you are new to thai food - it is delicious!"}
{"text":"With a very good location and busy line up of clientele most of the time , this Thai restaurant is a very big disappointment and serves nothing close to Thai food. This place serves the North American version of Thai food which full of sugar, salt and absolutely no flavor and balance to its dishes. The Pad Thai is too sweet and flavorless , no spice with the lack of balance and juices. They simply just thrown in a few pieces of chicken and meat with the odd number of bean sprouts, scallions, green onions . Everything is upside down with this dish. The Thai curries are also just mediocre in taste. Overall , too hyped and a very big disappointment :-("}
{"text":"Overall, 3 stars (Food was okay, but portions were small for the price.)

I visited Sorn Thai for lunch on a Saturday. We ordered specials from their lunch menu: hot & sour soup plus Pad Thai, and spring rolls plus Cashew Chicken. The food was ok, although a bit light on flavour. While we were not still hungry after eating, the portions seemed a bit on the small size considering their lunch special prices are $10.75 each. Also, tea is not included with the meals."}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant in Toronto. Spicy beef was super delish. Coconut ice cream was the best Ice Cream that ever had. There was shaved coconut in it. Yummm. Above all, super nice and attentive waitress."}
{"text":"Unlike other Thai restaurants I've seen, Sorn Thai looks warm, cozy and has a traditional look which I like. The restaurant is spacious, clean and this place is a comfortable place to dine. The staff provides great service and they are very kind and efficient. 

Sorn Thai offers appetizers, soups, salads, noodles, rice, meat, seafood and vegetarian options. Their dessert options are limited, but satisfying. Also, they have a nice lunch special, but portions for the lunch special may be too small for some people. I've tried plenty of their dishes and loved all of them! The food has always been hot, fresh and delicious! I particularly enjoy their coconut chicken soup, cashew nut chicken, seafood fried rice and the deep fried banana with honey and more. The portions are great, and the prices are very reasonable- except for the appetizers; they're yummy, but for the price the portions are rather small.

Personally, I really like Sorn Thai as it offers the exotic blend of Oriental and South Indian flavours with the aromatic spices of Arabia. If you're looking for tasty reasonably priced Thai food, and warm and cozy atmosphere with good service, I would recommend Sorn Thai!"}
{"text":"I to this place for lunch every weekend. The service is always great, food is amazing, good prices and fast service. Cant ever complain. Plus you get a card that on your 9th dish its free! 

Wish there were more locations!"}
{"text":"This is the goto spot for dinner with the parents. I've been here multiple times and have never been disappointed. Relatively busy everytime I go but always able to get a seat when we walk in. Tasty food. 

We always get about 4 dishes to split between us including the always fresh tasty mango salad with chicken and cashews. My choice is always an egg plant dish. 

Service is always excellent."}
{"text":"Was shopping around for the day and checked out Sorn Thai, the food's portions were kind of small but really good!"}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least.  My date and I went based on the strength of the reviews on yelp.  This is the first time this site misled us.  The fishcake appetizer was greasy and bland.  The chicken in the pad thai and cashew chicken dishes were grey and dry.  There are several other better values in town...in the end your choice."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious! I went with a friend who goes there all the time for lunch and is working her way through the lunch menu. I had the pad thai - so delicious! Cute little place, and very nice serving staff. They really seem to care about their customers."}
{"text":"I'm quite happy with Sorn Thai as my go-too Thai delivery place, but it's better to order early rather than later at night to get the freshest and best food from them.

The green chicken curry is great, and the spring rolls are amazing. The pad Thai is usually really good, but last time the shrimp was very fishy-tasting. 

Delivery is very prompt and usually right when they estimate."}
{"text":"The ladies who work here are great and the restaurant is clean and inviting. Their food is good but not particularly to my taste. My coworkers absolutely love the food from here so I plan on giving some alternate dishes a try in the future."}
{"text":"Delicious Tom Yung koon soup...and the best coconut ice cream. ..great place never disappoints"}
{"text":"Our favorite That food in Toronto. Been ordering regularly for delivery for literally 20 years. Can't go wrong if you're in North Toronto and craving Thai food!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a little Thai on Yonge, steer clear of Sorn Thia Restaurant.  The service is good but the food just mediocre at best.  I ordered the Hot and Sour soup, it was temperature hot, but  it wasn't spicy or sour and a bit sweet, disappointing on a cold night. The green curry chicken and marinaded beef dishes were bland. Both dishes were served with meat that was shaved so thinly and in perfect rectangular pieces that I questioned how it was done, and if it was meat at all. Save your money."}
{"text":"Cheap, good quality food and sizable portions!!! What more can you ask from a neighborhood haunt!"}
{"text":"The only positive thing I would say about this place is The price is fairly cheap ($10lunch) and the spring rolls were ok. I've had a lot of pad Thai around the city and this is the worst I've had. I would honestly rather eat Thai express. Overall decor was outdated and the place looked/felt dirty."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is authentic. I had the lunch special chicken pad thai; the portion is medium sized.  It came with a hot fresh chicken spring roll. Price is right. The chef has a fine hand. 

My dad whom is annoyingly unadventurous with food got the garlic chicken and it was just so so.  He ordered it as per recommendation of the waitress. I didn't pay it no mind since it was a chef signature dish, otherwise I would have helped him order.  I was disappointed.  Really it was just chicken sautéed with garlic - nothing special.   

I would go again for lunch special or even for their regular dinner - order some appetizers. Great casual date spot when you want to treat someone special to something different/fulfilling at a reasonable price. Eat in and have a nice time.  Prices are way better than a lot of thai places downtown - so yes I will be definitely make the trek to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I ordered Pad Thai and Green curry, as recommended by the server.
Pad Thai was alright, but definitely not amazing. Chicken in the green curry felt rather dry and didn't taste like out of this world - I don't think it meets my 4-star rating. I skipped so many restaurants to get here because of Yelp rating! I certainly won't go out of my way to recommend this place over others. To be fair, the servers were friendly and helpful, and they had a nice decor, but I'm not making another trip for food."}
{"text":"I was delightfully surprised of the great tasting food I received at this restaurant just around the corner from where I live. The food was fresh and hot and was served in record time.  I would definitely return and order different dishes. The vegetable Thai was excellent and the spicy tofu with nuts was well, spicy. Both dishes complimented each other."}
{"text":"We found this quaint seemingly authentic thai restaurant through yelp and decided to give it a try.

First impressions: the restaurant is cozy, a bit out dated, not somewhere that would impress your date.

Food: friend ordered the green curry chicken ($13) and I had the pad thai ($12).  The pad thai was good, not sweet and saucy like other main chain restaurants.  The amount of chicken,tofu, and shrimp were good enough to satisfy any appetite.   The green curry chicken was very very salty, my friend usually likes to add soy sauce on everything and even he said it was unbearably salty, even with rice.  

We didn't tell the wait staff about the salty dish so I won't consider it too much in the overall rating as we didn't give them the chance to rectify the dish. The flavor was food and the amount of chicken added was quite generous.

Overall it was an okay experience I don't think we would go again unless we were in the area prices are very reasonable and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I believe the quality has improved, generous portions and reasonable prices. Our go to for a quick take out."}
{"text":"Dropped in here while on a walkabout in the Yonge/Eglinton hood. I think once upon a time it was The Garlic Pepper location.  But anyway.  Very clean, nice decor and well lit.  The staff are very helpful and friendly.  I was there around lunch time and the food was tasty and fresh.  Really really liked and when I am in area I will be sure to stop by again."}
{"text":"Just a few blocks north of Yonge and Eglington is this little Thai restaurant doing what they can to serve up quality eats in a cozy environment.

A group of us came for a little dinner and catch up last week and while I felt the service was a touch spotty and befuddled at times, I found the atmosphere and food to be as good as any other regular Thai spots I've visited. Was it the best? No. Was it the worst? Hardly. Food was A-OK in my books as I compared it to similar dishes I've had at other Thai spots.

I went with the Mango Salad, the shared appetizer platter and the seafood salad, all of which was shared amongst a few of us and seemingly enjoyed by all. I was hungry so I ordered my standard Cashew Chicken done spicy and I really enjoyed it, I felt it had a decent kick to it in terms of spice and I really enjoyed the generous portion of chicken and the sauce.

Like most Pan-Asian cuisine in the 416 and 905 areas, there are plenty of options of every style but few that really excel beyond the rest. I would qualify  Sorn Thai in the average area but on the higher average, hence the 3/5 stars

Eatcrest out"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place many evenings at dinner time and it's always been busy. This is a good sign for a neighbourhood thai place. The food is great and the price is right. We had a lovely Lemon chicken soup and they spiked it with extra chilies for us. It was an excellent warm up on a cold winter evening. The Pad Thai was very good and nicely flavoured with tamarind and lemon. I'm used to seeing lime used, but I didn't really mind as there were plenty of peanuts (a pad thai must for texture). The spicy noodles that my friend had were made with a deliciously different sauce than the pad thai. Spring rolls were crunchy, hot and delicious. We would have liked to try some of the curries, but what we ordered was more than enough for us. The food going by to other tables looked well presented and smelled wonderful.
The service was outstanding and there was never a point at which our water glasses were empty or we didn't have something we needed. When we complimented them on the food they mentioned that they had been in business for over 15 years and their staff are all from Thailand.
The price was right at $35 for the two of us. We didn't have anything besides water to drink, but still reasonable for all the food. I would definitely go back. It would be a great place for a family meal or even a quiet couples dinner.
I took off one star because the decor is a little underwhelming and it wasn't the best Thai I've had anywhere, but definitely a good value and really delish."}
{"text":"Consistent good Thai food. Decent prices (moderate). Service is hit and miss and sometimes can be rude. The restaurant is clean but uninspired."}
{"text":"My dad was in town and wanted Thai food so I came here based on Yelp reviews. We came around 6:45 on a Monday - so I guess before the dinner rush. This place was small but decorated nicely, clean and well kept. We were greeted politely and promptly. 

We ordered the lemon chicken soup, curry beef and I got the pad thai. Lemon chicken soup was the right amount of lemon grass - and a lot of chicken! A good sized appetizer for two. Pad thai was great - not like the americanized, super red/orange pad thai. It was big enough for two people to share. The curry beef on the other hand - the sauce was good but the beef was too tough. Could just be a one time thing.

The waitress noticed we hardly touched the beef and asked us what's wrong with it. We told her and she, without hesitation, took the item off our bill. 

Will definitely come back to try more items - the Pad Thai is definitely worth coming back for."}
{"text":"I got their green curry, and my boyfriend the pad thai. Both were very tasty, and reasonably priced.

Service was acceptable, but I don't demand special amazing service. Didn't have to wait for a bill or chase anyone down.

So, good food, good prices. Can't complain."}
{"text":"Like many Thai restaurants, this one offers reasonable lunch combos.  I tried the Thai basil chicken.  It was better than most other Thai places because it included a mix of lightly sautéed veggies and fresh greens, making the whole thing a much more balanced meal that I usually get in a combo lunch.  Attentive staff, great view of the tall, fashionably braless woman waiting outside for someone who is apparently late.  All in all a fine spot."}
{"text":"very cozy thai place.

things to highlight:

service is superb!
music on the background is very appropriate to the place
good selection of veg dishes

we decided to order a glass of wine each for our dinner and since we never tried thai wine that was on the list we were hesitating if we should go for it. the server offered to give us a sample of the wine so we can taste and decide if we actually want to order it. 
it never happened to me before! tasting wine in a restaurant where average price per dinner dish ranges in about $12.

we ended up nor ordering that wine though.

the selection of veg dishes is very good and the food was yummy. the veg/tofu curry! yum!

the location is a bit off and the decorations are just ok but worth checking it out."}
{"text":"I agree with many others reviews saying portions are a little small, but other than that pretty good food."}
{"text":"Their delivery minimum is like $30...calling in and placing an order for $27 and being told I needed to order more food was embarrasing...especially since a $27 order becomes $32 with tax/tip!

Food is nothing special."}
{"text":"I give this place a good rating based on ordering 4 items (for two people). We had an Up-Country soup, pad thai, and spicy basil eggplant, plus coconut sticky rice. All were excellent. The spices used were just right. We asked for medium spiciness on pad thai but it wasn't very spicy at all. If I go again I'll get hotter. The coconut sticky rice was slightly sweetened with coconut and was tasty on its own.

Sorn Thai seems to be owned by Thai rather than Chinese, which is a plus to me. I love Chinese and Thai food but had bad experiences at a few \"pretend to be Thai\" restaurants where the food felt more Chinese than Thai. 

Prices are fair and taste is good. Portion is fair. My only minor complaint was the price on the soup. That not so large bowl of soup was $9.45 before tax, and it was mostly vegetables, but with two very large tiger shrimps. But I can overlook this because I was very satisfied with the other two dishes.

I'd definitely come again if I lived closer or frequented that area more often."}
{"text":"A lovely spot for authentic Thai food in midtown! 

Came here with a few friends for a farewell dinner and everyone loved it! The staff was very attentive and patient. We ordered the appetizer platter to start; ingredients were fresh and well-balanced. I especially liked the fish cake and peanut sauce combination, savoury but not overwhelming. 

For the entrées, we decided to each order something and share (being a party of 5, we got to try out quite a few things): Pad Thai, Soya Noodle (Chicken), Shrimp Fried Rice, Pineapple Curry, and Tamarind Snapper. The portions were a bit small for 5 hungry guys, but the taste and the quality of the food more than made up for it. The noodle dishes were seasoned just right and had just the right amount of meat and garnish to complement it. Everyone loved the snapper. I'm usually not a big fan of seafood but the crispy skin enveloping the smooth and silky texture of the fish is amazing. Usually when you fry something you'd expect most of the water to be extracted and be left with a dry interior, but that's not the case with this dish! The sauce is a whole other story - it's sweet and savoury but not overpowering. It's perfect on its own or paired with steamed rice. 

Overall, we really enjoyed the food and ambiance the restaurant had to offer. I will definitely go again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love the spicy mixed seafood!!! So fucking good! But the plain rice cost 2 dollars is a bit ..... Nice environment, if love to stay longer if the guy sit on beside table did not talk that much and loud~ lol"}
{"text":"The service is excellent and the ambiance is really good but the food could be improved. For one, they are a bit heavy on the salt - the calamari was especially salty and was also somewhat cartilaginous."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, quite and nice place. My favorites: papaya salad, coconut chicken soup and red chicken curry!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch & ordered the following: calamari, BBQ chicken and pad Thai. The calamari was delicious- crispy, well seasoned & tasted fresh. The chicken however, for both BBQ chicken and the chicken in the pad Thai was extremely dry. The BBQ chicken was also very salty, not tasty at all. The pad Thai was ok, nothing special and didn't have much-- some chicken, over cooked shrimp but the seasoning was decent. If the proteins weren't so over cooked, it would've been a good dish. Overall, decent food. I'd come back for the calamari though.. and the water was pretty PHRESHHH."}
{"text":"Love the curry!:) people here are super nice! Will definitely come again. Price is decent."}
{"text":"Great Thai food! Really authentic and tasty and high quality. Will definitely return. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Stir tofu with cashew / pad thai was good! Many of thai restaurant in toronto they put ketchup in padthai i hate it, but here isnt i guess. Also They use fresh ingredients  ;) But they close store earlier than they wrote on the door"}
{"text":"Decent place. It comes across as fancy but the prices are reasonable.  The food is tasty and delicious; however,  portion wise, it's kind of small. 

I definitely recommend the place if your in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend and they have some great lunch specials that are reasonably priced, perfectly portioned, and taste amazing. I got the pad thai which came out to 12.95 after tax and walked away feeling full but without the gross \"I'm going to explode\" feeling. 

I like this restaurant because I think it's super understated yet is still good. Their food isn't too sweet, salty, or sour and yet has so much flavour. You also somehow don't feel heavy or sluggish after eating it. 

Interior is kind of outdated and is decorated like a fine dining restaurant with the white table cloths and deep red table cloths but the service is great with the waitresses being super fast, kind and polite, and never letting your water get too low. 

Never been for dinner but if you're looking for a good lunch deal, I'd definitely recommend this one!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's very authentic. I lived in Thailand for six months and this is the place that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Small, informal location. I had the shrimp curry, a steal at 14.99 with 9 (count them, nine) jumbo shrimp! It wasn't that authentic, obviously made for a Canadian palate. Not spicy, but quite tasty. I'm sure I could ask for it a tiny bit spicier next time I go back (which I probably will.)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service. Staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is exquisite. Try their basil squid!"}
{"text":"Not bad! The location is pretty easy to get to and plenty of street parking when I got here. Yelpers seemed to really enjoy it here so my friend and I gave it a try. I was a little disappointed with the service because it took a very long time to place our order, but we knew what we wanted pretty much after seeing the menu, They seemed to be a bit stressed out and it wasn't really that busy in there. It was a fairly quiet late lunch. 

Anyway, the food was pretty good. My friend had a yellow curry which tasted quiet average. I had the Pad Thai which didn't really give me the array of flavours that you'd expect from Pad Thai. It wasn't especially delicious food, but I wouldn't go to say that it's bad either. It fills you up, tastes good with no expectations. I wouldn't make the drive here again, but if you're in the area and want a quick thai fix, this is a good spot to try for yourself. 

Maybe they just had an off day when i visitted?"}
{"text":"Reliably tasty, high-quality Thai food on Yonge north of Eglinton...and they deliver too.

Recommended dishes: Their sweet and tangy version of pad thai is always a go-to, but we also enjoy the hot & sour soup, the Thai BBQ beef (thinly sliced beef...bulgogi style) and the red curry chicken.

Aroi mak! 

(That's Thai for \"very delicious\")"}
{"text":"A group of us came here for lunch. For a mid-week lunch, I was amazed at how busy it was. They have a fairly extensive menu, plus specials. Portions are big enough for two meals.

I had the garlic chicken (one of their specials) accompanied by rice. The rice was rich, warm, fluffy grains for which I ordered a portion for the leftovers. The chicken,I initially thought, was way too strong but the next day it was everything I was expecting and more."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times in the last few months.  If you're a noodle person then I think you'll enjoy their pad thai and glass noodle dish.  If you decide to order their fresh rolls make sure you ask for the fresh ones and not the ones that seem to have been prepared days in advance."}
{"text":"We had a quick lunch here.  Not bad on the whole.  Basil chicken was pretty good, but not authentic, had more chilli sauce than you usually find,  usually it isn't included in Basil chicken.  The garlic beef was very good. The cashew tofu was also very good."}
{"text":"Favourite Thai food restaurant around. Service is great and food is fantastic! They are so accommodating every time I've come with a messy, noisy 1.5 year old and picky 6 year old! Will be back many more times :)"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a rainy night looking for a warm, flavourful, and decently priced dinner - Sorn Thai did not disappoint on any fronts. 


Decor: Nothing spectacular, nothing offensive - your average Thai restaurant with knick knacks and paintings. It was clean and pleasant.

Ambience: Laid back. Good for families, friends, or couples.

Price: So reasonable. Before gratuity, we paid close to $35 I believe?

Meal: We ordered spring rolls, green curry, and spicy vegetables with rice. Portion size wasn't massive per se, but definitely sizeable when sharing or even if just for yourself. I thought everything was quite tasty and not too spicy. My only complaint was that the curry had quite a bit of fennel flavour, which I'm just personally not a fan of. 

Service: It was fine and not overbearing. We were quickly attended to and our glasses were filled often. I was also impressed with how fast the food came, despite the place being half full.


Pros: Cheerful, cheap, delicious, good portion size.
Cons: Fennel.


I'm sure I'll be back to try some of the other dishes. Overall, a cozy dining experience."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant, nice, clean and pleasent and the food is AMAZING!!! Will definitely go back again! Kids friendly too"}
{"text":"Food was great. Small portion but blast of flavour in everything we ordered.  The pad Thai was yummy, the curry was great. The mango salad was even better.  Very good quality!"}
{"text":"Solid Thai restaurant on Yonge. We searched for this on yelp and were quite happy with the results. We had a decent sized group here and so we had the opportunity it's to test a variety of their dishes out. Starting off with their Thai appetizer plate (satay, spring rolls, fresh rolls, fried shrimp, salad) with satay sauce and a sweet honey. Something for everyone and delicious. Then we went with their som tam (green papaya salad) it had a great tangy lime flavour well seasoned and a generous serving. We also ordered a chicken curry, Thai fried rice and pad Thai. Overall everything was fragrant, that great mix of tang, sweet, salty and definitely worth coming back. 

Pro tip*** if you like spice ask for some prik nam pla. Or nam prik. It's a great condiment to spice up your meal and add that extra zing for those who can take some more heat. 

Overall pleasant service and great Thai food!"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

Sorn Thai was listed as one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto outside downtown. It isn't one of the most transit accessible places (subway passes underneath without stopping and nearest station is 20 min walk away), but it's manageable via the 97 Yonge bus.

This place is extremely busy once past 12pm. I arrived at around 12:15pm and got one of the last small tables, but we were completely full by 12:30pm. They only have the lunch special menus available at that time, but you can ask for the full menu if needed (but let's be honest, the lunch special stuff has most of the items you need already).

I ordered the pad thai. It's a Thai restaurant, why not? It also came with a piece of spring roll, which tasted quite good. The pad thai is a little different here compared to other Thai places; it has more of a lemon-y sour taste instead of the usual sweeter kinds that's common in Khao San Road, Sukho Thai, etc. Personally I preferred the sweeter kind, but that's just me. I still enjoyed the pad thai overall, and the portions here are larger than the ones in downtown!

Service was great and efficient, considering the lunch crowd. They manage to adhere to everyone's requests including the take out folks with only 3 servers, which was quite impressive."}
{"text":"Have been going for years. The food is great. It is a good place for families - and is always accommodating to each dietary restriction. We like the casual atmosphere. Service is great."}
{"text":"We heard the delivery from this place was good. What we didn't expect was just HOW amazing it was. The food arrived steaming (and I mean, can't hold the container so hot). Everything was super fresh, and I just have to say, the mee krob was the best thing  on the menu. It was affordable, tasty, and absolutely the freshest it could be without being in the restaurant eating."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Thai restaurants uptown. Pretty traditional atmosphere (unlke many of the trendier looking spots in the area). Very good for all your standard dishes, like pad thai and green curry chicken. The tom kha gai soup is great too. Dishes have just the right amount of kick, without the \"burning\" spiciness. Good prices, especially the lunch combos (main course + spring roll or a bowl of soup)."}
{"text":"Sorn Thai is another great Thai restaurant located at Yonge and Eglinton. It wins in terms of the food, service, and atmosphere. When we arrived there was a line up but there is a nice patio outside that is fenced where you can wait comfortably until the tables are ready. The wait was not long as well, and only about 5-10 minutes.

The interior of the restaurant has some older decor but at the same time it is very nice and comfortable as well. The walls are lined with dark coloured vertically striped wallpaper and decorated with Thai paintings. The tables are lined with burgundy tablecloths and napkins; and decorated with real flowers as a side center piece as well.

Compared to other Thai restaurants I would say that Sorn Thai has a wider selection of dishes. We decided to try the curry salad for starters, Pad Thai, red curry beef, as well as the pineapple fried rice. 

The curry salad was actually very good and not what I expected. It sounds stuffing but it was surprisingly fresh, light, tasty, and refreshing. It comes with some fried tofu, lettuce, fresh crunchy shrimp chips, tomatoes, sliced egg, and a very tasty peanut sauce where you can even taste the fresh peanuts. It tastes similar to a Malaysian dish called gado gado (5/5)

The pad thai was very good as well as I found that it had a nice home made taste to it but at the same time still very good. Just like the salad it came with crunchy grounded peanuts (not too finely grinded), big shrimps, as well as chicken. I liked that it was not too sour as well. The texture of the noodles was also cooked nicely, somewhat chewy, and not overly soft (4/5)

As for the red curry chicken I would say that the sauce does not have as much coconut flavour. The dish does not come with jasmine rice so you have to order that separately as well. They give generous amounts of beef and bamboo shoots, but I would say that the beef was a bit overcooked. But all in all the dish and portions were still good. (3/5)

Pineapple fried rice was made very nicely as well. It comes with big chunks of fresh pineapple, generous amounts of chicken compared to many thai places, as well as big shrimps.(4/5)

All in all I loved this place. Service was quick and friendly, and food was great. Will definitley be back again!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Thai food. The restaurant does not look much from the outside, however whenever you pass by this place on Yonge street the smell makes you drool, enticing you to go inside. 
Every time I'm here I see this lady sitting at a table close to the kitchen, making freshly hand rolled spring rolls. And let me tell you, they are delicious. The one fish that I akways order is pad Thai. You can always tell how good an Asian restaurant is based on their pad Thai. This dish is very simple but hard to get right with all the flavours that are involved. And let me tell you, Sorn Thai probably has the best pad Thai I've had in Toronto. I definitely recommend you to go there and try it out for yourself! Sorn Thai gets 4 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"Spring 2015 update: long wait, overcooked chicken, undercooked vegetables in our green and red curry. Was Victoria day Monday, not sure if staff was just inexperienced. Was a little boring. 

Just a fantastic experience from the tasty food to the friendly service. The spring roll is one of the best I have ever had and definitely worth a try to start your meal. Both the pad Thai and cashew nut chicken did not disappoint. Especially with some added hot sauce. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Time for an update:  I returned here for an elite event and found the food was better than it was last time I visited. I was happy to see they offered some healthier options - the mango salad and sampler platter were good, and I'd recommend this place for anyone craving Thai food North of Eg - you don't need to resort to Spring Rolls."}
{"text":"the service was terrible. the waitress that served looked like she didn't want to be there. the food was not very good. Thai food is know for it's balanced flavours but this food was just flavourless. very disappointed."}
{"text":"I found the vegetarian options limited and bland. I definitely prefer other Thai Places in the neighbourhood. It's not great but it not terrible either. With Thai veg options, you know what you're getting (vegetables, tofu and rice - ta da!)

If you are vegetarian definitely go for dinner over lunch as the lunch specials are particularly limited if you are vegetarian."}
{"text":"This place is good. Best Thai in the area for sure. The workers and owners are all super friendly and the food is old classic recipes and all tastes great. I think they could do a little remodelling to make it a little nicer looking though, but it's definitely not dirty. I love the cashew nut chicken and the spring rolls and shrimp chips with peanut sauce. Go for lunch and they have specials."}
{"text":"A chance to dine with the oldies but goldies Elites brought me  up to the Yonge/Eg area to Sorn Thai.  It's not a huge place so our UYE group of 20 took up about half the space.

We started out with a few appetizer platters that included spring rolls, crab cakes and satay sticks.  Denise, Johnson and I decided to go family styles and order a few dishes to share.  We got the classic pad thai ($10.45), crab fried rice ($11.95) and mixed vegetable curry with rice ($9.75).  

Portions were a bit smaller than my usual neighbourhood Thai place but the quality of the food made up for that.  There was REAL crab in the fried rice, generously large plump shrimp in the pad thai and crispy fresh veggies in the curry.

I'm not in this area very often but I'd gladly recommend it to those who live close by."}
{"text":"Excellent service and authentic tasting food. I have been ordering from them for almost a decade. Consistently excellent quality food. A true gem in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"This was pretty disappointing considering the decent overall rating on here. Plus it's the closest Thai place to me so the let-down hit a bit harder.

It's not that the food is BAD but it is incredibly bland. Nothing memorable or special about it. Nothing flavourful that will have you eagerly anticipating the next bite and leave you wanting more.

Too bad, I was really hoping for some good and easily accessible Thai food."}
{"text":"This was a personal discovery of mine in the neighbourhood. IMHO this place is in my top 3 Thai places in the city now, along with Salad King and Sawasdee. Their shrimp curry is unbelievably good. They don't skimp on the shrimps either, they're nice and big. You know what else matters about this place? It's operated and staffed with Thai people, which says something about the authenticity of the place. Bottom line: if you're in the neighbourhood + craving Thai food = you know where to go. Their prices are reasonable, if you're wondering."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly, and the food, especially the Pad Thai, excellent."}
{"text":"I have to add a little bit about the service. The server now always recognizes us, smiles a lot and remembers our order. Definitely worth the trek when we feel like cozy delicious Thai food."}
{"text":"The reason I love Thai food is their clever use of different spices and herbs to create the 5 different taste sweet, sour, bitter, spicy and salty. 

Sorn Thai Restaurant is a sad example of Thai food. I tried:

Sorn Combination Platter ($13.95) and Thai Spicy Noodle ($10.45) were both blend tasting. I requested to have my Noodle extra spicy and it still came out flat and one dimensional: salty.

Serioulsy, my friend order a Beef in Oyster Sauce ($13.95) at that price point is insanely overpriced!

The only thing good is their Singha and their polite service.

Now I know why I haven't been to Sorn Thai as yet. And I sure did not miss anything."}
{"text":"I'm both noob and picky when it comes to Thai food - I'm rarely displeased, but also rarely super impressed, and I guess Sorn Thai was no exception to this. I'm not in this area often, but found out about this restaurant on Yelp. It was small and cozy, but also nicer and classier than I expected on the inside with a small wine rack at the back, burgundy tablecloths, Thai statues/decor on the walls (but not in an overwhelming way.) I noticed a lot of older couples dining here, so definitely a more muted atmosphere but not super dressy either. Anyway, for a group of 3 people we ordered the following:

Sorn Thai Combination Appetizer ($13.95) - comes with chicken satay (on skewers), thai cold rolls, spring rolls, two fish cakes and shrimp rolls. Everything here was pretty standard, but I particularly enjoyed the chicken satay, which for some reason had some kind of honey mustard flavour/sweetness to it. 

Pineapple Curry ($12.95) - Everyone in my group enjoyed this curry, and despite the fact that it was just the tiniest bit too spicy for me, I liked it mostly because of the pineapple. There were pieces of chicken in the curry, but I thought they were too tough and dry and probably just overcooked.

Pad Thai ($10.45) - This pad thai was not the orange-y sweet-ish kind that you usually get at most place, but had more of a sour taste and was more yellow in colour. My friend who eats a lot of Thai food said she didn't really like it that much because she preferred the sweeter taste, but I thought this was okay. Similar to with the curry, I thought the pieces of chicken in here were overdone/too dry. My other friend also noted that \"the ratio of noodles to stuff is not good\" which I thought was a valid comment, as there really were a lot of noodles that I ended up just eating on their own. There were some peanuts in the dish as well, but to be honest I didn't really taste them at all. Either there were not enough, or for some reason they were bland, or the sourness from the noodles overwhelmed their flavour.

Surprisingly this place got busy and filled up on a Sunday night. We were really lucky to come when we did, because we pretty much got the last available table. We actually requested to switch tables because were seated right by the door and felt chilly, but were told we couldn't because all the other tables were reserved. They were kind enough to close the second set of doors for us though so we were a bit warmer. Overall it wasn't a bad experience, a pretty decent Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Done a take out from this place a few times recently. Great location - right on Yonge street. Their food is well priced with most dishes being in 10-15$ range. They offer free spring rolls on take outs. Standard Thai cuisine. Good quality ingredients. Take out service is quick. Have tried the following dishes: green curry chicken, chicken basil fried rice, thai spicy noodles, chicken salad and spring rolls.  Will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Given that Sorn Thai has been ranked as one of the better Thai restaurants in Toronto, I'm surprised it took me this long to give it a shot. We arrived around lunchtime on a Friday and the place was completely full. (Luckily a table quickly opened up.)

Being the Pad Thai maniac that I am, it took me all of two seconds to decide what I wanted off the lunch menu. The dish is also paired with a choice of soup or spring roll and I went with the latter.

The spring roll arrived a short time later and it was fairly delicious. It was fresh, piping hot, and greasy, and the flavors were good (if not outstanding). It did, however, come with a sweet, spicy sauce for dipping and I have to admit that elevated it substantially.

The Pad Thai arrived soon after and I was impressed by the amount I received. (The combo costs $9.95, after all.) It's definitely one of the better variations of this dish I've eaten as of late, with the fresh-tasting chicken and surprisingly delicious tofu contained within a bounty of tasty noodles and a sauce that isn't too sweet (which is the prime problem with most Pad Thais in the city). My one complaint would be the total lack of spice. Pad Thai, in my opinion, should be extremely spicy but this wasn't even partially hot. I guess I'll ask for spicy next time, but this is something that should be asked of the customer when the dish is ordered."}
{"text":"Ordered laab kai, and som tam, asking for them to be extra spicy, but they came out essentially flavorless."}
{"text":"I went for the lunch special based on the good review on yelp. It seems an authentic thai restaurant because the staff spoke in Thai.  I ordered the basil beef and it came with spring rolls or sweet and sour soup.  The basil beef was very decent size. It came with veggies, rice and salad. However, I found the beef to be a bit too salty. I had to eat all the rice in order to balance out. Overall, good enough for lunch, but I am not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"First visit to Sorn Thai.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  Restaurant was clean.  Able to accommodate table of 8.  
Calamari was perfectly fried crispy on a bed of crispy white rice noodles. 
Fresh rolls decent tasting.  
Mango salad well marinated n zesty.  
We also had the basil fried rice, pad thai,
Deep fried banana with coconut ice cream. 
Breading on banana tasted okay 6/10.   Seemed to be a flour coating.  I prefer it dipped them deep fried then coated with sugar and heated till they caramelized . 
Was still a good dinner."}
{"text":"Went there with my parents..their first thai experience.  We started with spring rolls, chicken satays with peanut sauce & Tom soup..,delicious.  Pad Thai was the best, my moms favourite and my dads was the green curry. Great waitress & would definetely go back."}
{"text":"Lunch special is where it's at for Sorn Thai. Under $10 for soup or spring roll and a main dish with salad and rice. I always get garlic beef but warning you will leak garlic smell from your ears! I don't care it's so tasty however have had to tell the waitress to medium-rare it or it will come overcooked and dry. The appetizer sampler is also a great deal and so delicious! They make their own home-made sauce and I love it! Also inexpensive I've never spent more than $20 for a single person. By the way the decor is negligible- its bright, clean and spacious very Thai like. Just ask for more water when you need it they seem to forget but they're so sweet here it's not intentional."}
{"text":"Not as amazing as everyone made it out to be. Ordered the appetizer platter, pad thai, and green curry. Appetizers were good. My bf didn't like his pad thai but I liked it because of the sourness of the tamarind in the sauce. My green curry was NOT good. Chicken was overcooked and very dry. The curry was too watery, not thick. It wasn't fragrant. I was looking for a balance of spices and coconut - none was found. Also, no larb or spicy papaya salad on the menu? I must add, the staff was nice and attentive throughout the night though. Overall a three star rating means okay food but I will not return nor recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been in and about the Yonge and Eglinton area for about 10 years and the first time I noticed this place was last Thursday. Boy was I pleasantly surprised. When going to asian places I always look for cleanliness. This place has it, so they were off to a good start.

Pretty small menu for lunch, but the place was relatively busy. One item on the menu really stood out for me. It was the chicken satay because I haven't had it since I have been back to Asia. All of a sudden I got a craving to eat that so I ordered it. The food came relatively quick, so it would be doable if you were on a work lunch break. The lunch came with a spring roll or a soup, the spring roll was good. The lunch came and I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken satay was very tasty even came with my favourite peanut sauce. I wish there was more on the plate, but for the price who's complaining. I do have to admit the salad was a little bit sad, but overall it was a good lunch.

Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Was not horrible, was not great.  

Came here at lunch with two coworkers today and it wasn't incredibly busy, I'd say 60%. Service was friendly with a smile but getting our waters topped up was an effort. 

Two of us ordered pad thai and one ordered spicy noodle. The pad thai lunch special is chicken only (no shrimps) which is understandable since it's cheaper than their regular menu by a buck and you get a choice of soup or spring roll with any special. 
The spring roll was good and I like the sweet sauce that comes along with it. The pad thai was a generous heaping of noodles. If you're into authentic, this is not as it's clearly the ketchup-style pad thai with no hint of tamarind I could detect. No limes were harmed in making this dish (they used a lemon x_x ) and not much in the way of veggies (a bit of bean sprouts). 

I'd most likely check out one of the other restaurants dotting the Yonge-Eglinton area."}
