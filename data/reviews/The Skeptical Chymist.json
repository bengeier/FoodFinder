{"text":"What a fun and energized venue! Skeptical Chymist is tucked in a corner, but well worth the find! Seahawk flags greet you outside, as well as clever window displays. The inside is clean and friendly. 3 nearly wall sized TV screens flank the front hosting a variety of sporting events sure to please any sports fan! A large prominant bar lines the opposite wall. The drink and food menu is varied with a great selection of beers, wines and specialty drinks. We started with a sampler of their signature Guinness Infused IPA followed by the Soft Pretzel appetizers. The pretzels were warm, light and flaky served with smoked Gouda fondu and a beer and dijon mustard dip. They were Outstanding! We'll come back for this alone! The entre portions here are plenty! The Smoked Gouda Mac N Cheese will not disappoint! The Fish N Chips as well as the Chicken Strips were also tasty.
Our servers were friendly and attentive and we even met the owner, Derek! Skeptical Chymist has everything a 12 would want in a modern Irish bar! We can't wait to visit again and experience a Hawk game!
Thanks for a fun evening!  Kathy, from Washington State"}
{"text":"Having our own little St. Patrick's Day soiree planned this year, my family decided to go out and do a little  Irish research.  We headed out to The Skeptical Chemist for dinner.  We have been here 5 or 6 times for dinner, drinking and all things Irish.... but this was definitely a school night dinner.  I dug out the Entertainment Card (a girl has to make cuts somewhere) and the four of us headed over.  We arrived and settled into an open table.  It was early; we were really just interested in some Celtic grub and a quick pint.  Fish and Chips, Shepherd Pie, Potato skins and some Harp Beer Battered Chicken Tenders rounded out our order to share.  All good dishes...as always.  Add a couple of beers and we were on our way to St. Patty's Day research nirvana.  All was good.   No complaints... until.... the check arrived.
Not only was it very confusing... Additions, subtractions and ?????(Remember we had our Entertainment Card, buy one dinner entree, get one free) the waitress had taken it upon herself to add an 18% gratuity without even mentioning it to us (a table of 4)  Hahahha     Bad decision on her part.   My husband ALWAYS OVERTIPS!  She screwed herself. He was pretty put out that she did that, and then did not even have the courtesy to mention it.   Anyway, if you are looking for a NoScott Irish bar,  Skep Chem could be your place for the 17th.
Food, beer, ambiance are good.... Just check your check for automated tipping!  Happy Saint Patrick's Day!  In case you can't tell, I'm IRISH!"}
{"text":"Cool hidden spot in North Scottsdale right next to the 101 tucked in a small shopping plaza.  Love the dark feel on hot, sunny days.  Cold beer and great service.  Lots of tvs and perfect place to watch sports.  Also, the relatively new menu and happy hour items are a huge improvement.  Really enjoy the mussels and potato skins.  Definitely worth a stop if you are nearby."}
{"text":"Good food and great beer selection!!! Definitely stop by for a pint. The fish and chips are the best I have seen in a while."}
{"text":"great selection of beers on tap!  I am pleased to go into a place that offers a different selection from the normal sports bar, yet still has plenty of the old stand byes!  food is great, happy hour is awesome! I love the daily specials, which encourage me to try something new at a reasonable price as well!  service is rock star super awesome and amazing as well! i usually end up in Joey's section and also had the pleasure of  being served by Kyle this evening.. both are super helpful in helping me decide on a delicious beer and always there with a smile or anything i need!  this is one place id be proud to be a regular at!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here, but something in the last 8 to 12 months sucked the soul out of SC.  A good selection of late night pub food, friendly service and great atmosphere.   Last couple of times I went, the food needed some serious improvement and getting a beer at the bar I felt like I was throwing a wrench in the bartender's coital plans for the evening.

Bring back the huge chicken fingers (and season them!), excellent sauces and remind the bartenders that for every bloke that has to wait 10 minutes for a pint because he's making the moves on a patron, Four Peaks is just a stone's throw away."}
{"text":"Walked in and the SeaHawkers club had just left.  The place was a wreck and they were scrambling to get the tables cleaned and the restaurant back in order.

Good service, good food and cold drinks.  Use the 4Square app and unlock an additional dollar off your drinks, even during happy hour."}
{"text":"I just had the BEST fish & chips at this restaurant! Delicious food,  service is EXCELLENT! Love it!"}
{"text":"This was possibly the worst restaurant experience I've had in my three years in north Scottsdale. For starters, the food was extra salty. I had a cheeseburger with bacon and had to take off the bacon to make it edible. My friend had a smoked salmon sandwich extremely salty- the sandwich and bread. Then to top it off we were watching he Pacquiao and Horn fight, they cut it off right before the winner was announced. The ultimate ruin to a great fight. Unfortunately it was covered by horrible waitress service. We literally had to give our order while she ran by the table. Will not be going back to that spot and advise others to proceed with caution."}
{"text":"Great Irish bar! 

Great authentic food (I attribute any poor review to the fact that authentic Irish food doesn't taste like American dishes...who knew?), but they have typical bar food as well. Excellent place to watch sports (it is a WA bar, so Seahawks and Huskies will be featured) with an excellent selection of beers, Irish whiskey, and Scotch."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes for our food. Not god because we were in a rush! 
Once the food finally got to us I was impressed by the food presentation. It wasnt just thrown on the late. My peppercorn encrusted pork loin was sliced and fanned and placed a top special red onions laddened with green beans and scallopped potatoes.
we went here because we saw a coupon in val pak.  THEY ADD TIP WITH THIS COUPON. the coupon says skillfuly preparred so i guess thats the warning it takes awhile to cook the food. the food didnt appear to be microwaved or seated under a heat lamp . the food was just freshly hot!
 my boyfriends fish and chips were just fish and chips. small piece of fish with shoe string FF . we ordered Ice tea to drink and you get a huge glass. so kudos there
plenty of seating in here. dark but nice looking for an irish pub tables and chairs hard hard wood uncmfortable. and if your a tall person sit at a high top.

 But I wont be back. Service took to long. Male waiter was moody and grouchy. and i didnt feel comfortable."}
{"text":"This place reminded us of our trip to Ireland recently! The atmosphere (minus the big screen TVs) was very much like Irish restaurants/pubs. The food was very good as well, and the service was very quick. We'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"was in the area from out of town, stopped by and had delicious fish & chips and a stongbow cider..

service was good, food & drinks were good.. really enjoyed it..!!"}
{"text":"Open late, have a nice, rotating beer selection. The staff is friendly. Good place!"}
{"text":"Everyone, please be advised - Happy Hour ends promptly at 6:00 PM. If you show up at 6:04 sit at the bar, and ask if it's still happy hour, the nasty bartender bitch will respond with a sarcastic \"no\" and then walk away like she's too good to serve you. Not only that, but when you inquire about the different beers they offer and how they categorize them on their elementary chalkboard, she will laugh at you like you're some kind of amateur who's never been outside of the four walls of your house. Menu is generic, nothing that differentiates it as a true Irish Pub. I was disgusted by the bartender's snotty attitude and we left without spending a dime. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I L-O-V-E the Skeptical Chymist!  I went for a Seahawks game, while visiting Phoenix and had an amazing time.  The decor is great and the atmosphere was lots of fun. The staff was very friendly and effiient.  I had fish and chips, which was very good and my friend had the cod sliders, which she loved.  This place is everything an Irish Pub should be."}
{"text":"In my search for trivia nights ,  I visited the place this Tuesday. Place wasnt too crowded, not sure its the norm. The food was decent  and service was ok. The place can be difficult to find in the complex . The trivia was fun, good variety of questions and overall ok experience. I will visit again on a trivia night but will keep it as one of the options, not the only one."}
{"text":"We took our kids here for St Paddy's Day dinner. I don't recommend doing this. My husband and I were charged a $10 cover at 4 in the afternoon and even after explaining we would just be there for dinner and we were told we had to leave by 6pm when their restaurant turns into a 21 and over venue only. Their menu was limited for the holiday so I wasn't allowed to order the hummus plate I wanted so I got garlic fries which were yummy. My kids and husband ordered the corned beef and cabbage and were disappointed in the small portion, but satisfied with the taste. They had a brown gravy over the corned beef which I thought was unusual. We ordered one of the bread puddings to share and should have ordered two. I'll be back for the bread pudding and a beer...without my kids and not on St. Paddy's Day."}
{"text":"This establishment has become our neighborhood favorite simply because of one reason:  the exceptional food. Everything that we've ordered, from the yummy shepherd's pie (with LAMB) to the spiced-how-you-would-like-it chicken curry to the savory mussels in broth have been consistently strong. Flavors are complex and well-developed.

Our only complaint is the service; it is very inconsistent. We don't expect or desire it to be overly attentive, but the majority of time we go there, we feel pretty ignored. Maybe it's just us, but I suspect not! Luckily, the food will keep us coming back for more."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!
My boyfriend and I come here for happy hour drinks about once a week and love to arrange meet-ups with our friends here.

The atmosphere is awesome! Every inch of the place is designed to look like an old Irish pharmacy. There is always something cool to look at.

The staff is always friendly and helpful. I've only once had a problem with a bad attitude from one of their servers and haven't seen that girl since. Everyone else is an absolute pleasure and always willing to answer questions and make suggestions. Very attentive and charismatic.

It can get pretty crowded (don't even bother coming on a night the SeaHawks are playing) but there is plenty of seating and a small party can usually find a table. Larger groups should plan on arriving early and coming on less busy weeknights.

They have a great selection of beer, wine and cider and a full bar for any mixed drink you want. They also cycle seasonal and promotional beers regularly so there is always something new to try and they're always happy to let you have a complimentary taste, which I love! Prices seem pretty standard to me. Happy hour has great deals and every day of the week has its own all-day drink special.

The food is really hit or miss. The burgers are amazing and the chicken tenders are great but a lot of their food in general is a bit atypical. For instance, the flatbread pizzas come in varieties including \"bacon onion jalepeno\" or \"date and black pepper\" but just a meat'n'cheese choice isn't on the menu and their \"tacos\" consist of pulled pork and coleslaw. Everything I've tried has been totally delicious, but if you're looking for good ol' simple bar food, you might not like their menu unless you're willing to be adventurous. Like with the drinks, there is a daily special every day of the week except Sundays and flatbreads as well as appetizers are half-off during happy hour.

One of my personal favorite reasons for coming to this bar is Tuesday Night Pub Quiz. Live bar trivia in teams that's WAY more fun than the answer pads and monitors used at other bars. There are a number of regular teams but we've had lots of fun getting a ragtag group together to go and try our best.

Overall, I fully intend to continue frequenting this place for it's charm and feel-good atmosphere."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we meet here, as it was kind of in between him and us (that is to say, 1/2 hour for us, 2 hours for him). He hadn't been before, but thought it sounded good. It is as good an Irish Pub as I would expect to find in a strip mall. Since all were driving, we didn't partake in the Irish spirits, but I have no doubt they do this well, as evidenced by the other patrons. I had the shrimp louie, which was very good. My companions seemed to enjoy their dishes (burger and fish and chips) as well. The fish and chips were huge. It wasn't very noisy, but that may have been largely due to the unusually small crowd. The service was extremely attentive. Overall, I was quite impressed and will keep this in mind for the next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Great food, great selection of craft beer and great service.  Love Chris and Bridget! Slainte!"}
{"text":"The Skeptical Chymist is the place to be! Great environment and the staff is amazing, especially the server DV! He's super awesome with a beard of a legend. This place is legit! GO HAWKS!!"}
{"text":"What happened? Have been visiting for years....always enjoyed. In the past month have visited twice and ordered a half and half as usual.....pretty simple for an Irish Pub....both times they asked what do you mean...there are lots of half and halfs. Well it is Guinneas and Harp...duh. They never asked before......
Both times it came totally mixed. Employees said owner did something to the nitrogen mix ...probably to save money. Apparently they pour correctly with spoon and then the separation disappears and you get a mucky mix. HORRIBLE. 
Also, other guests with me ordered their usual beers and they were not very cold the last couple of visits. Icky cool beers. More money saving?
I'd rather they raise themprice for a good product then charge the same for dreck.
What a disappointment. Guess we will all be lookin' for a new pub. Hate to....always enjoyed my visits...must be 100 or so....."}
{"text":"I was in town to attend Super Bowl 49 and was directed towards this establishment because it is a Seahawks bar.  It was fun to connect with fellow 12s from all around the country. The bar itself was overrun with the large crowds in town for Super Bowl.  The staff seemed overwhelmed and could not wait for the weekend to be over.  The food was okay but nothing to brag about. The live band they hired to perform on Friday night was terrible. The overall vibe was fun and I will stop by next year when the Seahawks are in town to play the Cardinals."}
{"text":"Went here twice. I agree with one of the other yelpers, that the service was inconsistent.

1st visit was on a Friday night. The place was packed, but the server was friendly and attentive. The decor was really nice. It was a little loud, but the place was good enough for a 2nd visit.

2nd visit was on a Saturday afternoon. The place was dead, maybe two tables occupied in the patio, yet we waited 20 minutes without any service. The server came in and out several times to help the other tables, but not once did she show us any acknowledgement, menus, water, nothing. I think the only time the server recognized our presence was when we were walking out. I hope she saw my dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"The service was so slow. She didn't even come check on us despite waiting 30 min for our apps!"}
{"text":"Who else wants their money back? Commercial Superbowl parties should not be hosted by amateurs."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The layout is interesting and set up in a way that would allow very large groups to sit together without sharing an awkward table, or it forces other parties to interact and, you know... actually be social at a bar...!
It was a pretty slow evening when we arrived, so we snagged a couple of seats at the bar and had a great experience.  The bartender was very friendly and walked us through their extensive beer list.  My husband tried a few flights and liked every recommendation.    We ordered mussels and beef wellington - both were to die for!  
I imagine this is the place to be for St. Patrick's Day or during football season, the patio seemed pretty nice too.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our first time dining here and we will return again.  Our waitress, Danielle, greeted us cheerfully, brought drinks, took our order and followed up with just the right amount of attentiveness.  We ordered the flat bread 1/2 off Wednesday specials.  I had the BBQ topping minus the onions.  The sauce might have been a bit more tasty but the flat bread was really good.  The lunch time crowd was modest but everyone seemed to be served with a smile and the food came out in a reasonable time period.

The decor is quite interesting and is a nice change from the often sterile atmosphere of many a grill.  Give the place a try."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. I like that its a Seahawks pub! I tried the fish and chips and it was pretty tasty! Can't wait to try other stuff on the menu! Definitely coming back, gonna have to try and watch the game!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of co-workers Monday evening after work. I was suprised to see how tucked back and hidden SC is in the strip mall area it's situated in (if in a different location this place could have great potential). Once inside, it was completely empty (which I couldn't believe, especially for a big Monday night football game, plus it seemed like a cool Irish pub). They had awesome happy hour specials ($5 burgers w/ fries), which made me want to come back again and try new things out. I went ahead with the lamb shepard's pie which was great, and everyone else enjoyed their meals as well. 
Overall a great experience...I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"This is a Seahawks themed bar , I'm from Seattle so I appreciate a little home town loving!    Had the basic burger .... About what you would expect from a bar.    Amazing!!  Lol!   
Can't wait to come back here and try to watch a game here.   Hopefully hawks vs cardinals!"}
{"text":"We went around 12 noon frist clue,the place was just about empty. Music was loud and obnoxious for lunch time during the week. Which is sad the nice thing about Irish Pubs is the varied music. I decided to order a draft No Murphy's No Bemish, only Irish brewers were Guinness or Harp.Which the bartender lacked the skill of layering. When I sent my drink back and ordered an IPA the bartender left the bar to serve me up. Threw the coaster violently at the table when placing my drink down infront of me told me I did not know how to order my half and half they never stay seprated. UNPROFESSIONAL,rude and stupid.I should of left than but was with my 80 year old father who doesn't get around well.
I ordered Turkey Club with sweet potato fries. Not too much of a sandwich for 12$ My dad got a burger it was just ok"}
{"text":"This place was great - we were in town trying to find a place to watch the Mexico-Panama World Cup qualifier and stopped by this place after Four Peaks, which was overcrowded and playing baseball only. Even though they didn't have the game, we stayed anyway. They have open seating and it was lively, but not crowded, on Friday night ($5 Irish car bombs!). As soon as we sat down, our waiter came by and immediately took our drink orders while we looked over their menu. Very attentive the entire night. He made some great recommendations. I had a pear cider (which was life-changingly good) and the boyfriend stuck to Guiness. For dinner, we shared the pork tacos (were some of the best tacos my boyfriend's ever had, and he grew up in Mexico) and the bacon jalepeno flatbread (which were good, but not spectacular). For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding and it was perfectly rich without being overwhelming. The live music they had was this older gent playing mainly 90s hits on an acoustic guitar, and was a perfect addition to the atmosphere. It is a little pricier than we were expecting, but for Scottsdale and the quality, you can't get much better than this place. We will definitely be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Our party of four had dinner here, three of us ordered burgers, one got the steak special. Three out of four really liked the food, so I guess that's 75 percent customer satisfaction. The place was packed (there was a group watching a college football game--extremely loud) and the service was slow and forgetful, we had to ask more than once for things. I'd go back, although I doubt that one of our companions would ever do so--his burger was way overcooked, he had to ask for ketchup repeatedly and finally just got up and swiped it from another table. But the oddest thing was when he asked for mayo, the server looked at him like he was crazy and like she'd never heard of such a thing. The men were happy with their beers (one ordered a Black & Tan) and the women w/their drinks. We got dessert to go, it was very good (bread pudding and a brownie) the next day."}
{"text":"We went to Skeptical last night(Sat 10/5). We frequent this bar because we like the food and the music.  We could not believe how bad we were treated.  Even tho the website said Aussie Jim was playing football was on. When we asked the bartender we were told-curtly-that there would be no music. We sat at the bar and ordered a drink and the bartender was very unfriendly.  She never, ever, smiled once.  We ordered food and another drink and we were asked \" Are you ready to settle your bill?\"  Really?  We left, went to Four Peaks and proceeded to spend 100.00 on food and drinks.   The Skeptical bartender chased away profits. I own a business and know what it takes to protect my profits. IF I go to this bar again I will not sit at the bar again and be disrespected by someone who is taking my money.  The bartenders and staff at Four Peaks were fantastic so I have to think that is where I want to spend my time and money.  I cannot say the name of the bartender because she did not have a name tag but the bleach blond hair should be a clue...."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the Chymist since it opened.  It was a great local bar with personable and attentive  bartenders, waitstaff and even the owners are cool.

This past summer it's lost it's mojo.  The bartenders have become curt and unfriendly (especially the blonde gal)

Trevor, please spend more time at your Bar.  It suffers without you!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to enjoy some Irish fair, a few Guinness drafts and some great live music. Staff is always attentive, Had a great St Paddy's day! Cant wait till next year"}
{"text":"Sweetest staff and great beer selections. By far my new favorite place to grab a beer!! Still haven't tried any food yet but I don't normally eat out much. Great place for good conversation and a fun, more laid back night. I'm definitely a new regular now!"}
{"text":"I was told about this place as the unofficial home for the Seahawks (aka as the SeaChickens) in this area.  Seattle was playing a Thursday night game, so a group of fans and I decided to go there and give it a go. It is a Irish style pub tucked into a corner in a strip mall.  Although I had been in the mall a number of times visiting Golfsmiths, Best Buy, and Northern Lights, I had no inkling this place was even there. We got there early, jut in time for Happy Hour, and it was great. Half price off of all appetizers and flatbreads, and $2.00 off all beers and wine. In addition, they have great daily specials.

It has quite a gathering for Seahawk games, and it can be pretty noisy and wild during the games.  However, I did return on a Monday night to try their $5.00 hamburger (a great bargain), and although it was busy, it was a very friendly and easy going atmosphere.

With their daily specials, great happy hour, and friendly atmosphere, this could become one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Had a great tine tonight with this red headed server.  Polite, great to talk with and the bald beared server was awesome too.  We were here on draft night, love the surroundings.  Stop by for a cold beer and great food."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here Sat., July 9th. I ordered the special, corned beef and cabbage. The cabbage was somewhat undercooked, almost raw.
My wife ordered a rum and coke. When we got the bill, we were charged for premium rum which we did not order. An 18% tip was added to the bill. The waitress was worth about 10% based on service.
We won't be back, but will inform others to be aware of what we found.
The place is dirty, with dust on furniture and decor."}
{"text":"I go here quite a bit, especially on Sunday for the $3 drafts.  The cook here is very good but the talent only shows on some dishes.  The fries need a little work.  They are delicious but, and I don't know how this happens,  they are too fragmented.  Why do we get so many tiny pieces of French fries in the basket?  The date flatbread was an interesting idea, but I don't think it works.  In general,  I wish the flatbreads were not such a dominant part of the small plate menu.  The Reuben is the best I have had except for maybe Chompies."}
{"text":"The food is good for its price, but as a Seahawks bar, it's allowed to get very raccous for Sunday games."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago, the verdict: overpriced mediocre and slow. The Reuben was unremarkable and I nearly died of thirst. Latenight is better with plenty of half and half stouts (ie black and blue) and generally likeable live music on weekends."}
{"text":"Best beer selection in the area. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable of the different beers."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! I have been to the all day happy hour on Sundays and they have great deals including all the craft beers too! Only downfall is its a seahawk support  bar so if you are a fan of any other team it is hard to sit to watch any other game but great service! great food! and a great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to come and watch the game. The food is REALLY good too. Went here with my some family and Jillian was our server and she was great! People like that can really light up a place. I have yet to take my boyfriend here and his office is so close, I can't wait to show him this great find! :)"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this pub, especially on Tuesdays for quiz night. The food is what you would expect and the service is excellent. Being close to our home is also a plus. The interior is well thought out and a real departure once one steps through the door from the strip mall atmosphere where the pub is located. I can't believe that someone complained about the parking unless they are unable to walk 50 yards out into the GIGANTIC parking lot that serves this pub and all the other business within close proximity. The crowd is a real mixed bag which is great. One can tell this pub is owned by actual British folk (Scottish actually - even better)."}
{"text":"i always forget how amazing the craft beer selection is here until i walk in again.  god i love this bar!"}
{"text":"Warning! Do not go here on Sundays unless you are a Seahawks fan! My boyfriend and I were looking for a new place to watch football, and innocently walked into this place wearing our football jerseys of a different team...big mistake! We actually got booed! This place is a Seahawk only zone, and nobody else is welcomed. If you are looking for a fun place to watch football in the area, head over to Twin Peaks which is within walking distance. They have great food and a fantastic football atmosphere where everyone is welcome."}
{"text":"Though they had a decent selection of beer, I was disappointed that they told us the kitchen was closed at 10:10pm when we called before heading there at 10pm to ask the closing time and was told 11pm. Good thing buffalo wild wings was willing to serve."}
{"text":"Didnt get a chance to actually eat here, we showed up as the kitchen went on to their late night menu. But the hostess was very kind and the service seemed on point just wrong timing on our part."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic Irish pub. The staff is friendly, the food and drinks are great. I have always had good experiences here. If you like soccer or any sports they are always on.  Unless they have live music

If you don't have a good time at the Chymist, you don't know how to have a good time. Do you self a favour and just stay home. 

Thanks for doing such a fine job."}
{"text":"First confession- I've only ever enjoyed alcoholic beverages here. First voyage brought me here to enjoy a pint of Guinness. They have a variety of different beers which has kept me coming back. I have yet to try any food-they have some delicious varieties but maybe a bit too heavy for my tastes, some lighter options besides salads would warrant some good competition from their Four Peaks neighbor. The staff is always courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"If you are headed here for St. Patrick's weekend, I would be indeed skeptical. The corned beef and cabbage plate was laughable - 4 puny slices of corned beef, a scoop of potatoes and a nominal portion of shredded cabbage. What kitchen guy talked management into that?
Go for a Harp or some whiskey, but save your appetite for a place that serves real portions or you will still have an appetite after dining here. 
P.S The demi-glaze on the corned beef was plain silly."}
{"text":"Nice place to go with friends and enjoy a wide array of beers. I have only tried the nachos as far as food goes but it was pretty good. My only complaint is that every time I've been there the place is dead quiet."}
{"text":"I really really really want to give it five stars. And it's really bothering me that I didn't, but I feel something is missing here. I mean the food is good, try the Rasher burger and fish and chips, the drinks are cool, 3 dollar Carlsbergs, but something is seriously missing.....? 

The atmosphere is nice and \"pubby\" and even my server the last couple times had an Irish accent, but why don't I feel right when I leave? 

The prices don't knockout the wallet, and the speed of service is relatively impressive...

Ok, it's defintely worth stopping in and grabbing a burger or fish and chips, and a couple guiness', and if you feel the same way I do, let me know why, because I sure don't?????? Maybe it's the......."}
{"text":"I love this place me and my mom go every other week for football and it is always packed with Seahawks fans and the severs are great they remember our orders and every thing I tell any seahawks fan about this place.

Go Hawks!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not from Scottsdale but was visiting and wanted to go to a bar with friends where we could hang out for a bit.  We looked up bars on yelp [naturally] and came across Skeptical Chymist.  We had a blast!  The bar staff was really friendly and the drinks were inexpensive.  Technically, I guess this is an \"irish pub\" but I would categorize it as better than a typical one - I mean, they played wilco and the shins, people.  The drinks were poured extremely well (my gin and tonics were perfectly mixed) and there seemed to be regulars enjoying the evening."}
{"text":"A must stop for any Seahawk fan! I was here for the Super Bowl and the Saturday night prior. The place was beyond packed and the atmosphere was just electric. Sadly the game didn't go our way, but it was still a great experience. Next time I'm in AZ I need to check this place out on a less crazy weekend. Go Hawks!"}
{"text":"Tried the fish n chips since it's been a long time and I was in the mood for fish n chips!
Portion was good, I cleaned my plate.
Chips (fries) could've been crispier, they were kinda soft, but still delicious and it didn't stop me from shoveling them in! Fish was OK. Not a flat fillet, but a chunk. 
Beer list looked VERY SOLID and filled with quality crafts including Firestone's Sticky Monkey. I didn't have a beer cuz I was on lunch, but I mentally chose a flight for myself.
I asked about the mussels dish, and was told it was very good - my server's favorite. I like mussels a lot so I might try that when I return. You'll notice \"(PEI)\" next to the title of the dish -- the mussels are from Prince Edward Island!
INSIDE SKINNY: All you can eat fish n chips on Fridays for $14 and half-off apps during happy hour! Check out the website for other daily specials."}
{"text":"Mediocre, overpriced food, delivered slow and cold. Some of the worst service I've ever had to pay for. And stay away from any special events. You'll end up dealing with a short, bald, hothead owner that clearly doesn't have the fortitude to handle a large venue. Save your money, and go to the place 100 yards to the North, which has a better facility, and friendlier/more attractive staff."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with a laid back atmosphere. The food is fantastic and prepared perfectly. They also have a great selection of beer. But definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like The Skeptical Chymist - it's described as an Irish pub with the look of an old apothecary shop.  What I walked into was a mishmash of kitchy pub and Seattle Seahawks sports bar.  There were only two other tables occupied so we thought we'd get quick service, but I suppose they don't advertise quick service so it was ridiculous to expect it.  What we did get was: 1 child size portion of corned beef & cabbage at full portion price, one plate with food that was specifically requested not to be there, and my plate had a special surprise of something I'm highly allergic to buried under my sweet potato fries - at no extra charge to me, of course.  The food was not good, but not the worst thing I'd ever had - until it came to the bread and butter pudding.  It was elastic, plastic and unnaturally chewy.  The only way to get bread pudding to change from bread and custard to elastic and dish sponge is by brutally torturing it in a microwave.  Please don't take people you like to eat here."}
{"text":"we are huge fans of this totally awesome place i like to call home... but even bigger fans of our waitress"}
{"text":"This is a solid pub. The atmosphere was nice and service was good. The best part is their great happy hour and specials. Happy hour is 4-7pm daily. Half off appetizers and $2 off beer and wine. the mussels were pretty big and very tasty. We also ordered the jalapeno onion flatbread which was a little soggy but had good flavor. I would go back here again for sure!"}
{"text":"A great little gem in the middle of silicone and generic places. Great music, vibes and of course, beer. I highly recommend the König Ludwig Weissbier on tap. It is organic and tasty!!"}
{"text":"Decent pub with a decent vibe, as long as you can find it buried in the corner of a strip mall. Any craic during the week must end by 10 and they look to close up as soon after that as possible. This sounds like a bad review, but really the place is pretty nice. They can't help that they set up shop in scottsdull. They had a pub quiz on Tuesday and a singer/guitarist on Wednesday, so they are, at least, creative. 

On the plus side, they have an excellent black bean burger for the veggies. And to repeat: a decent pub with a decent vibe. I have not spent too much time in this area but that could be larger commodity than I know. Competing with Twin Peaks and Short Kilts, well, it's an easy win there."}
{"text":"I have really tried to like this place. Love the vibe and concept. Two things kill it for me: 

1 - Cigar smokers on the patio that set-up next to service window and make the entire restaurant permeate and reek of smoke. There has to be a middle ground. FYI, 90% of Arizonans DO NOT SMOKE. Most good restaurants ban smoking all together (Four Peaks or OHSO).  At a minimum only allow smoking away from the window. 

2 - Server 101, \"Everything'\" on the menu is NOT great. Pick out a couple of items from each category that you are passionate about and can speak to. When a server says everything is great, it tells me they either do not know the menu or are poorly trained. 

If you like a smokey bar that is Irish themed, then go for it. If you are in the neighborhood, I would suggest the other two places mentioned."}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect that  a place with such a name is an Irish restaurant. It's just fine. But it isn't anything that would make you're great great grandmother weep for her motherland."}
{"text":"Big fan of the Belfast burger, especially on Mondays when it's a mere $5. Great beer list and good service.

Never been here for live music or Seahawks games, but it's a nice atmosphere anyway."}
{"text":"I went here for the lunch special and some beer. Both were good, but the bar service was lacking. Nicole C ?    was constantly leaving the bar area to run drinks out to the entire place!. It got worse when she disappeared for long stretches of time. There was nobody tending the bar for quite a few long periods of time. She was nowhere to be seen. I found that quite unusual and annoying."}
{"text":"Stumbled on to this bar by accident. Wasn't too busy on a tuesday night but oh man was I glad i did. Great irish pub. Tasty food and good beer. Odd note, there was something they put on their roasted veggies that was amazing. Maybe it was just Parmesan butter or maybe it was something else. Either way, i like it. If im in the area, this is the bar i want to go to."}
{"text":"This would probably be my favorite place if it wasn't  for the smoky smell inside.  They might as well allow smoking inside as it smells as if they already do.  I always thought that you had to be so many feet away from the inside of the establishment when you smoked.  People basically smoke at the bar."}
{"text":"Visiting from Seattle and what an awesome find!! Seahawks bar out here in AZ gotta love that!! Great beer, great food, awesome atmosphere and lots of Seahawks fans!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. Please look at my Yelp about Arribas on Pima and you'll understand how much I  skeptical more than I did in the first place. They came to our rescue after Arribas REFUSED to wait on a table of 15 very hungry and thirsty women after a long day of work, on Cinco de Mayo. It was a well organized reunion of girlfriends; reservation was in 2 weeks prior. Nightmare. I'm a Seahawker, called skeptical to see if they could accommodate us, all 15 of us walked over a and found tables set, menus standing up and a waitress ready to take our orders. From the delicious oatmeal shots to the pear cider to the amazing wings, it was the BEST Cinco de Mayo we could have ever asked for! Proud to be a SEAHAWK!!!! Now skeptical has 14 more fans that I can take with me on game days!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here on St. Patrick's Day! The event outside in the tent with the drink selections were great. Live music was entertaining and the crowd was also very fun!"}
{"text":"Good for drinks but I have yet eaten anything there that was actually good. They do pour a good Guinness!"}
{"text":"Was able to get a table for the Seahhawks Vs Saints game. WE got a table on the patio. Even as busy as they were, the service was prompt and spot on! I only give it 3 stars because I didn't try the food, and there was only 1 very small TV on the patio."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. It's one of the best \"Irish bars\" in Scottsdale and the atmosphere is very cool. Sort of 19th century apothecary sort of place with a wonderful staff and great selection of beer and spirits. Of course, the drinks are great and they sure know how to pour Guinness and all it's wonderful concoctions (Black & Tan, etc.). What may surprise you is the food. Do the whole \"when in Rome\" thing and get some Irish fare. Their Shepherd's Pie is fantastic."}
{"text":"trying to see the menu as it has been a long time since I was there.  No Menu on the website?  How can that be?  
Update please.

Staff quickly took care of the \"down\" menu!.  Looks good.  I will go by and try you again.  Thanks for the quick action"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Lots of beer. It's hot in here, I'm sweating. Beers could be colder too. I haven't had the food."}
{"text":"The Middleton is always expensive but dam its good.  This is a great place to go for good music, great fish sandwiches and amazing bread pudding.  (make sure you ask them for a piece from the middle of the pan and extra sauce as these are the best pieces- very moist and delicious)  They often have live entertainment.  The patrons are very nice most of them professionals of some sort and the bartenders are great.  I like the atmosphere but whoever picked this location should have their head examined.  Its hard to find and the parking which is a small inconvenience for me is most likely a big deal for others who don't like to walk or stagger long distances.  Still highly recommended for a great Irish experience."}
{"text":"I visited The Skeptical Chymist for the first time on Halloween night. The evening featured live music and even a costume contest with great prizes.

The Skeptical Chymist is basically walking distance from where I live, so I was excited to give it a try. I also can't help but be drawn to the name (it's a cool name).

Overall, I was pretty impressed with The Skeptical Chymist. It's everything you would expect of an Irish pub-themed bar experience.

TONS of indoor seated, plenty of outdoor seating, and truly unique styling add up to a fun experience and engaging ambiance.

I didn't order food, but the drink menu was surprisingly impressive, including a long list of craft beers handwritten to a chalkboard wall and even a decent number of quality scotches and bourbons (my favorite go-tos).

***During my visit, I was helped by a truly outstanding server named Derek. Derek had dressed up as Venom, which was really cool, too. He was talkative and engaging and fun. I couldn't have been more pleased with the service he provided. I'd go back on that alone.

Typically, Irish pub-themed bars are not my favorite. This one, however, is a notable exception. I'm biased because it's so close by, naturally, but I'd recommend it to anyone. If you haven't been, check it out. You won't be disappointed.

***THANK YOU, Derek, for providing such great service and for making me feel at home in a new place. I appreciated that very much."}
{"text":"This Is The Best Bar.  I've Been Coming Here For Two Years Now.  Service Is Excellent n The Food Is Amazing.  Derrick Is By Far My Favorite Server.  The Fact That This Bar Is My Favorite Football Team Spot Makes It Even Better.  My Friends That Aren't Seahawks Fan Even Love It.  If You Want A Great Night Out With Friends Come Here To Skeptical Chemist You Won't Leave Unsatisfied.  I Promise."}
{"text":"Seahawks central!

 It was a fun place to watch the Seahawks playoff game, though there were almost no specials for an NFL sunday game place--disappointing, considering that so many other bars offer at least a set of discounted apps and drinks for Sunday specials. The only offered $3.25 draft/bottles. 

The food was expensive, and while they were generous on the portions, paying $10/plate for anything isn't what you want while watching football. Nor was it anything special. 

The waitress was attentive and helpful. We had the fish and chips and a few beers, and it was a decent amount of food (a lot of fries). We wouldn't go back unless to specifically watch a Seahawks game during playoffs."}
{"text":"Not instant, but prompt service, and the waitress was perky and friendly. Decent food--Shepherd's Pie was good. If I lived nearby I'd go back. Liked the decor."}
{"text":"TOASTED BUNZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ !!!!!!!!!!!!!! FINALLY!   YESSSS!  INSERT STADIUM CHEERING!!!!   Score   SC

Ordered  Fish sliders, excellent, sturdy, delicious, all because of the toasted bunzzzzzzzzzz, this small important detail seems to almost always go overlooked at so many places,,,not here,,,,its the very foundation of almost anything Damn Good not becoming soggy, messy fast food crappy.

Husband loves their beers &  food too, hearty, kind of close to homemade.

Cool atmosphere, kind of dusty ship-wrecked, pirates and tales from the tomb. you know YE OLE  local pub. DIG IT."}
{"text":"Bartenders were rude! Didnt even acknowledge my boyfriend and until we were leaving. I wouldn't even selected one star but i cant move forward on posting this review"}
{"text":"This Irish Pub is pretty hidden away, and I'm not sure I'd recommend searching it out.

They have a small, decent patio that's dog friendly, but unfortunately, to get there, you have to walk that dog around to the back of the building, passing through their disgusting trash area.  The view of the patio?  The noisy on-ramp to the 101 freeway.  It's also pretty dirty ... my wife ended up with bugs in her beer and her water.

So the patio isn't great, but service is good, the Happy Hour specials (1/2 off appetizers, $2 off drafts) are excellent, the beer is tasty, and the food is all fine.

It's a Seahawks Bar, so I bet during football season it's tons of fun.  I bet also St. Patrick's Day is a blast.  Outside of those times, I would only recommend coming here if you want a quick drink and appetizer during Happy Hour."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  This was my 3rd time here, first time for lunch.  The food and service was spectacular!!! The fish and chips, the best I've ever had, including some places in London!! The Blackened Chicken Sandwich on TOASTED chibatta, done perfectly.  They also have amazing happy hour specials from 4-7 and I recommend the crab cakes.  This place is all around perfect, I just wish I would have found it sooner.  They also do a recurring Tuesday night trivia night, which packs the place and is great entertainment. 

Top notch all around!"}
{"text":"Erica with a \"C\" was one of the most professional and personal bartenders that I've ever met. And that's saying a lot coming from someone in the restaurant industry! I was lucky enough to have my beer poured by her, which was amazingly poured by the way, with the perfect amount of head. She was attentive throughout my whole visit, and offered me another beer before my glass was empty,\"which is brownie points in my book.\" Erica with a \"C\" is the best addition to your great bar since my first visit (4 years ago). If you amazing ladies like Erica with a \"C\", your bar will flourish more than it has since she started working!! 17.39/10 would recommend to my friends and colleagues.... Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"My pal Comer said it best when he said \"Bar food is a fickle master.  Certainly, there is something to be said for simple American fare made from high quality ingredients and served hot and fresh by a friendly beer wench with a smile and a wiggle.
 
That said, so often today, the standard menu of cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches and cheese steaks is abused.  The cheese steaks are poor and the burgers bland.  With that in mind, one is prone to venture out to one of the higher classes of pub/grill establishements.  Skeptical Chemyst in North Scottsdale is one of these offering a bit of Irish flavor to tempt the odd fellow in search of beef and beer.
 
I have yet to see the aged Irish ex-pat responsible for this fine eatery.  In fact, I have come to grow suspicious of the somewhat Disney appearance of the decor.  Perhaps they tried just a bit too hard.  The menu is a lively mix of Irish sounding dishes and the typical American staples.  The servers are by and large female and attractive and for the most part friendly, but I digress.
 
The ruben, as should be expected is traditional and served with a large portion of thick cut fresh corned beef.  Possibly a little dry, I would ask for Mayo or extra dressing.  The fish and chips are served American style with smaller portions of breaded something or other or more traditionally, as large slab of half a fish in a nice beer batter breading.  The stew sounds promising but we were warned away from it by the staff.  go figure?
 
The highlight of the menu is the Belfast Burger.  A large patty of quality ground beef cooked to order. Yes, you can get it pink and warm in the middle.  Topping this burger is the magic.  Grilled onions peppers and shrooms dripping with cheese.  A large tasty bun, and a giant onion ring.  It is truly a mouth watering delight and when served with an icey Carlburg Lager is sure to leave any Irishman worth his clover feeling sated and happy.  A second Carlburg and a Car Bomb later and you will be ready to dance a jig with the lovely little brunette behind the bar aptly named Kelly.
 
The late night crowd is a disappointingly young group of college aged rugby wannabe's and their not so cute dates but lunch time is a pleasure and Happy Hour on the patio is a treat.  Most of the TV's are wasted showing soccer matches off the satelite dish but I suppose it adds to the flavor of this very cute, satisfying, mental vacation to Irie\""}
{"text":"I can't understand how this place got only 3.5 stars,it is awesome food!!
The chicken tortilla soup was great,the meals are really big,and it's delicious 
Definitely 5 stars"}
{"text":"Sorry the flat bread is a date, not fig flat bread!   it is AWESOME!  Sorry about the typo in my previous review!"}
{"text":"The service was great, very friendly. The fish n chips were not greasy and they were big cuts of fish. FYI this is Seattle Seahawks bar. (Still didn't hinder my review, lol)."}
{"text":"This place is really great. I love the decor, feels like you're in another place but really, you're in Scottsdale next to the freeway. They have live bands on the weekends, which is neat. They have a restaurant, bar, and outside smoking patio.

For St. Patty's Day, they have a big festival in the park with beer stands, games, and live bands. It gets really packed in the pub for St.  Patty's so if you're not into that, be warned! 

The food is great. I've had corned beef and cabbage and Shepherd's pie. Both were delicious and met my craving for \"Irish\" food."}
{"text":"I took my family to Skeptical Chymist to meet with some friends from work.  We definitely enjoyed the food a lot - it tastes fresh and made-from-scratch.  They definitely carry a lot of Irish beers and ales, which my friends tried and enjoyed.  I had a hamburger - which tasted great.  My family all had the Southwest Chicken Burger - and they all loved it - they said the chicken tasted like it was cooked on a grill.  I would suggest the owners add some acoustic panels in the ceiling as the noise level was nearly deafening.  Next time I am going to try the corned beef and cabbage - it looked delicious!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  I dig the cozy Irish Pub feel, but I am sorry, the service from the girls behind the bar consistently slow and unfriendly.  It's like we're invisible when we sit down at the bar.  I don't need that vibe at the end of a hard day.  The guy bartenders seem to be a lot more friendly and knowledgeable about the beers etc.  It's pretty clear some of the girls just don't give a crap.  Has potential, but needs some new blood."}
{"text":"This is a great little Irish bar. I am not a fan of Irish food so I have never eaten there but the drinks and decor are great! My husband and I actually went here on our first date and then went again after we got married and the owner made us a special drink and toasted us. What a great place!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a lunch place near my office when I came across The Skeptical Chymist on Yelp so I thought I would give it a try. When looking at their menu I came across Beef Wellington which I love and is hard to find in the valley anymore.Ordered takeout with a side of scallops potatoes very tastie but the portion size was very small otherwise I would have given higher marks also the sauce was au jus a brown sauce or perigourdine sauce would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"Took twenty minutes to get a drink on a dead Thursday night at 6:50pm. Vodka with splash of soda was all soda and no vodka. Ordered the salmon sandwich with scalloped potatoes. Salmon was the saltiest fish I ever ate. Potatoes had zero seasoning. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Of course this is a huge Seahawks bar, but in the offseason it should be safe for cardinals fans to enter. The patio is a smoky crowded mess, so avoid that, but the bar was empty and had good service on a Thursday night. I just had two Carlsberg beers for 7 bucks total as that is an everyday special. Food looked ok, but Monday burger night seems to be the most popular night. Whoever was playing music was good as well. Not a bad hour long visit."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after seeing and hearing about it for years. It was a weekday night, came for dinner. They had an acoustic guitar player/singer who was really good, added bonus. By the time we had finished dinner, place was almost vacant by 8 PM. Seems like a nice \"after work, get a beer\" type place. The fish and chips were pretty good, but I thought it was way overpriced at around 16 bucks. I don't go to bars because I don't drink and drive, plus, I'm just not that social. That being said, I don't think I'll be back for the food either. One and done, Was OK."}
{"text":"1st visit:

Friday lunch - Can't beat the \"All You Can Eat\" Fish & Chips Friday special. Fries aren't anything to get excited about, but the pieces of fish are massive and delicious.

Very nice selection of beers, on tap and in bottles.

Good service. Convenient location. Lots of parking.

Decor is fun to look at. All kinds of old medicine bottles, antique signs, other memorabilia.

Fun place. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I cannot believe they took the crab cakes off their menu.  I was tempted to leave, but the shepard's pie keeps me there."}
{"text":"If you're a Seahawks fan, this is the place to be in Arizona! My old roommates found it when they first moved here & I never understood the hype til they took me! We're from Seattle so it's nice to be in a place that reminds us of home with all the fellow 12s! On game days, this place is CRACKIN'! If you don't show up early, be prepared to stand to watch the game but it's worth it! The owner & staff is overly friendly, the food is delicious & the drinks are bomb. I like their 5$ mimosas on Sundays! If you order, make sure to order the fish tacos or chicken tenders. They're to die for! Their corned beef is good too if you're in the mood. This place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable afternoon atmosphere, and even tough it was about 110 outside, we were able to sit on the patio near the bar and smoke. If the group of people I met while there are any indication, the clientele is quite friendly and approachable. I'd like to go back in the evening and see what sort of selection they have of single ladies! 

By the way, the service was good. My friend ordered some food and what I ate of it was good, typical bar food. I'll definitely go back on a ladies night!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible we walked in yes they were busy but the staff particularly the dark haired server with glasses probably mid-forties was very very rude.  We sat at a table that had some dirty dishes which our group stacked up to help out.  The server came over grabbed the dishes and my friend thanked her, the server snarled and never spoke.  We sat a few more minutes the server came back and wiped only a portion of the table still not saying a word to us. We then over heard two staff members talking saying \"who's going to take them, someone has to\"!  We sat a few more minutes then decided to leave.  One of our parties in the group wanted to tell the manager who was bartending how the service was.  The rest of us waited outside and another group came out gripping upset with service.  They had ordered drinks and sat for 30 mins and never got the drinks so left.   The manager ignored our group member not even saying I'll be right with you.   Would never recommend or go there again.  Too bad the live entertainment was good but playing wrong place."}
{"text":"I've only gone during the day for lunch, and the food has always been fantastic.  They have great lunch specials and every beer you possibly could think of.  I'm not a beer drinker, but everyone there seemed to be lovin' it.  Service has always been great and friendly.  I would go back anytime - at least during the day."}
{"text":"This is our home away from home!  The service is always very friendly, the food is great, and the prices are always reasonable.  They have a fantastic happy hour and a great selection of beer.  The corned beef and cabbage is so good!  Really all of their food is great.  Good bar to go watch sports or to hear some good live music later on the weekends."}
{"text":"I have only been here for two things. BAR TRIVIAAAA and Happy Hour! BOTH ARE GREAT let me tell you. The last time my team (a group of my friends) played bar trivia we got second place and I got to keep our prize, a Skeptical Chymist gift card. Which I definitely used. Let me tell you, Four Peaks is literally next door, BUT during happy hour this place is a great spot for beer and some cheap food. The flatbreads are all half off on happy hour and they are great. I got one with chicken and red peppers etc. We also tried the half off cod sliders. Those were pretty good, tasted crispy etc. The tartar sauce was okay, and the bun was a little sweet, but hey, I am not gonna complain. The girls also enjoy cocktails on happy hour, one personal fave I have now is a 'snakebite' its half hefe and half cider. This is also on their happy hour for a mere $3 per beer! HOLLER.

Anyway, good beer, good food, I also like the out door tables. Although the face the freeway, whatever. On a hot day, the shade and the misters are what is good. Plus I like the wind blowing in my face from the cars whizzing by. Just kidding. Its not like that. But definitely check this place out for a casual happy hour. There is smoking on the patio, I believe. Not my thing especially when I am sitting out there, but hey if it suits you, there ya go."}
{"text":"Love this place. 
Ok don't let the exterior fool you. Yes it is a strip center. Yes you are in North Scottsdale. But for a pint of Guinness happiness...seriously get out of your car.

So this place is cozy and relaxed. Great for lunch or to relax after hours.  If you get a burger, be hungry or share.  That is all I'm gonna say.  And the fries...awesome.  They are crispy shoe strings of goodness to please your taste buds. The ruben is pretty good and sloppy. Will say, what the fish sliders.  The tarter sauce is...different?

Get close to the bar and check out the rotating seasonal beers if you are deviating from Guinness. (but really who does that in an Irish Pub?)  There are plenty of great whiskeys to taste.

Basically, this is your great hang out pub to enjoy and not got to the run of the mill.  Great mix of beverages to please one and all.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Irish nachos are delicious! Perfect choice for a bar breakfast before a Seahawks game with 100's of Seahawks fans."}
{"text":"After many more trips, they've won we move. They take reservations which is great for post work cocktails.

And I've fallen in love with their pork sliders and garlic french fries. There is green sauce that comes with the fries which I wish I could bottle. Mmmmm! 

Wait staff hustles and always keeps your drinks full."}
{"text":"I have been to this Irish place a few times now and I go there for close convenience and to meet friends. The beer of course is pretty good, they are Irish after all, the food is ok too, just like typical bar food. Its good enough to fill your stomach while you're drinking, but don't expect a gourmet meal out of it. I only gave it three stars because of the service and the incredible freaking noise in there. Bars are loud and fun, I get it, but must you crank up the music to the point that conversations are impossible? Perhaps the service is as o bad because they cant understand you either. I'll come back here, but only for the good beer."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible at best.  The food was ok and what you would expect from a pub. Our waitress (Linda) ignored our table like we had a plague. Our party sat down and she asked if we wanted anything. It was 15 min before we saw her again and when we did, we had to get her attention as she walked by our table. We ordered our drinks and a different runner brought them out. When our water was empty we went to the bar and the bartender refilled them for us. For our second round of drinks, someone from our party went to the bar and ordered our drinks because our waitress (Linda) kept walking by our table and never even cared to ask us if we needed anything.  Again we had to get her attention to place a good order. Not once from the time we placed our food order to the time we asked for our check, did she come by our table and ask if we were ok or needed anything. We ordered water for the table before we left and 10 min later she still had not brought them out. We had to ask another waitress who then brought them out. The restaurant wasn't packed, but it was busy. There were several empty tables and empty chairs in the place so to blame it on the crowd is a copout or an excuse."}
{"text":"If you want to taste the best fish & chip in the world, this is the place. We just came back from Alaska & Seattle, places supposed to have best fish & chip in the world, not even close. 
Staff is always friendly. This is a grate place."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times for after work drinks with coworkers since it's just down the street from where I work. It's an ok place, but with 4 Peaks just on the other side of the parking lot we usually tend to pass on this place. 

We went yesterday and it was a disappointment. We got there before they started charging a cover (at 4 pm) otherwise it would have been $10 to get in. I'm guessing that this was to pay for the limited tables, chairs and one tent they rented. Also the band who was singing \"Your Body is a Wonderland\" and something else by Snow Patrol. Also they were charging $6 for drinks. It was just a little ridiculous. It was pretty much imposable to get drinks or food inside, which those of us who have tried their food before, weren't big fans of anyway. And to top it all off they closed Rubio's next door. 

A funny sight were these two ladies who brought a little girl who looked like she was 6 and 2 babies who didn't look old enough to walk. The moms' had a beer in one hand and were each pushing their stroller with the other. I know times are tough, but it you can afford buying a $6 beer, you can afford getting a babysitter."}
{"text":"Went here the day after St. Patty's. Place was empty but the table we sat at still hadn't been wiped down. Still hadn't been wiped down by the time we left. Food was OK. I had a nice Black and Tan to start the meal and ordered the fish and chips. Received a huge portion of nicely fried Cod and shoe string fries. I personally like wedges or crinkle cut  round chips but it's not a big deal. They do have huge burgers and my friend couldn't finish his Cheese Burger. Neither had room for dessert. Typical pub. Nothing to rave about. Maybe they were just recovering from the day befores party. I'll give them another try the next time I'm in Scottsdale to see if I have a better experience."}
{"text":"We come here occasionally and decided it was time again.  The beer list is still impressive, maybe more than before. My problem was that I couldn't remember everything so after my Guinness I had difficulty with my second choice.  I hadn't noticed the music before: maybe it was louder.  The food was good...better than before, I think. Service wasn't great, particularly as we needed to leave for another engagement and couldn't find our server.  This is an interesting place to go but I may not hurry back."}
{"text":"Best mac & cheese! The smoked gouda is reminiscent of the velveta your mom used to make mac & cheese with but this is way classier and the addition on bacon, chicken, mushrooms and roasted tomatoes takes this traditionally simple dish to an elevated foodie level. Great food and even better service. Also a shout out to amazing fish and chips....and it's a Seahawks bar! See you there for preseason! I hear the Irish nachos are a must for game day."}
{"text":"Have you ever noticed how stupid people look when they dance to Irish music? 

Do you ever imagine that starting the night with shots of Irish whiskey will end with you placing drunken bets at the Indian casino while your boyfriend pukes in the bathroom?  

Do you ever find yourself in a deserted parking lot in North Scottsdale asking strangers if there are any establishments nearby that actually have customers?  

Do you ever sit on the patio and have men blow cigar smoke in your hair, thus tainting you for the rest of the night?  

Do you ever have a guy try to hit on you when the music is too loud to actually talk?  So, you just end up yelling at each other and shaking your head as if you actually understood a word they said.  Then, you motion that you are going outside and he decides to dance rape the poor girl who stayed behind. 

Needless to say, I'm skeptical about going back."}
{"text":"Yes, it's an \"Irish\" bar but not a bad one. The beer selection is adequate, the ambiance is pubby and the food is passable. I had the \"spicy\" chicken curry and have to say that I have never had a more bland \"curry\" in my life. Here's a suggestion, put some curry powder in it!

Over all it's a nice enough place to hang out but I only go because it's close to my office, I certainly wouldn't make it a point to come here otherwise."}
{"text":"Great beers on tap. Anything from nitros to ipas. Good Irish pub fare. I had the morning midden and it hit the spot. This is the place to go watch the Hawks whenever they are playing.
Good Happy Hour specials every day of the week.  GO HAWKS."}
{"text":"The steak salad was pretty tasty. Small menu but a wonderful atmosphere. They even have live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"Very cheerful, upbeat atmosphere. Excellent service. There is a huge screen that usually shows sports for the fans. And, a happy hour that makes the food significantly cheaper. If you are wanting to listen to modern Irish jigs while eating delicious food (who doesn't?!), read on.

I've ordered a number of appetizers and dishes here. The cod and pork sliders are by far the best. There are also wings, fries and Irish-style pizzas, and tacos, among other dishes. If you are a first-timer, make sure you go during happy hour (4 pm to 7 pm) and order pork tacos and cod sliders; you won't regret it. God, I'm salivating just thinking about going back."}
{"text":"I like this place for a casual meal.  They have sweet potato fries which is always a plus for me.  The service can be a bit slow at times so may not be the best place to go when you're in a hurry.  Sporting events are always on the big screen TV and there is a live band that plays on the weekends.  I wasn't sure what to expect the first time I went, but I have returned a few times so they must be doing something right.  As a girl from New Mexico, I highly recommend the Green Chile cheeseburger.  I wish they had gluten free buns, but I just order the burger without a bun and it's super yummy."}
{"text":"For AZ standards this is an Irish Pub that made an effort in it's furnishing and I really enjoy the Apothecary look and feel.  Well done and great selection of beer on tap."}
{"text":"A few summers ago we had a chance to drive all over Ireland for two and a half weeks. The Skeptical Chymist has rekindled some of those memories and happily, have made a few new ones as well. 

For those who have been to Dublin, The Temple Bar near the River Lify is legendary. The main difference between the Skeptical Chymist and that pub is color. One is painted blue, and the other red.  Really. That's about it.  Oh except, this one has more Seahawk jerseys. LOL

If I understand the history correctly, the Skeptical Chymist acquired a lot of wood paneling and interior, from a Pub that was being torn down in Ireland. Well, it feels genuine, down to the Labrokes style Punter's Turf Window (photo).  Nice!

We came for Happy Hour (3-6, Mon-Sat), around five and we initially had the place to ourselves. That didn't last long because a NFL game started drawing in a crowd around five-thirty. 

Now, the Skeptical Chymist serves both Irish and Irish inspired food.  They have Lamb Shepherd's Pie, Corn Beef & Cabbage, Fish & Chips, Beef Wellington and my favorite, Irish Breakfast served all day.  

They also have Irish Nachos, Celtic Pot Stickers, Crispy Cod Sliders, Belfast Burger and Pub Fries.  Oh yes, you can find Guinness on tap, and Magners, aka Bulmers as well. The pub is well stocked, so you certainly won't be going home thirsty.

On our recent visit, we ordered the Irish Nachos for $12.79, which were excellent (photo). They were made with pulled pork and drizzled with a Sriracha sauce. Nice! Instead of corn chips, they've serve them with thick cut potato chips. So much for the famine.

We also had the Celtic Pot (photo) Stickers $10.79, made with corned beef and served with a spice teriyaki sauce. Great flavor. Great idea. 

The main take away about The Skeptical Chymist, Irish Pubs aside, is that it's a fun place to go. You will never have a bad time here, unless of course, the Seahawks are losing.  Go Seahawks!

Our tab came to $39.71 including taxes, but before gratuities. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A great place if you like the bar ambiance. The food is A-OK - to good. You kind of enter a different zone when you leave the strip mall atmosphere and enter the doors.  Great place for meeting a few friends."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere for a strip mall Irish pub in North Scottsdale!  The happy hour is a great deal too - 4-7pm each day for $2 off draft beers...$3.25 for a pint of cider makes me very happy!"}
{"text":"Great Irish Pub with delicious food and lots of great beer on tap. Great staff, excellent atmosphere, and the best Seahawks bar you'll ever go to!"}
{"text":"Surprising Irish bar in Scottsdale AZ- largest Seahawks bar in AZ (go figure).  I had the Butcher's block: a pair of grilled lamb chops, braised pork belly, Irish Banger, black pudding (aka blutwurst, blood sausage, morcilla), skewered and grilled veggies, and mint dipping sauce.  Sounds heavier that what it really is- Irish light meal.  Everything, especially the lamb chops, was excellent.  After eating, you do not get that semi-comatose feeling from eating a heavy meal.  The bar itself is charming and has personality- even though it is a Seattle Seahawks bar.  The staff is very friendly and know their stuff.  Next time I am in the area I will try their version of Beef Wellington and the half dozen other dishes on their menu that sounded positively worth trying.  This is no ordinary sports bar."}
{"text":"Ah, one of my favorite pubs.  Good food, for Irish fare, and great beer.

Plus they have live music on the weekends, and a great vibe.  

If your in Scottsdale and need an Irish pub too hang out for a few, this is the place."}
{"text":"We concluded our St Patty's day event at the chemist. It is always a nice place to meet in N Scottsdale. For the event they build a huge tent in the parking lot to handle the overflow crowd. They were well staffed and very busy.  Nice work"}
{"text":"We ended up getting sick after eating at this \"restaurant\". Only seems good as a bar. Service was on the slow side which you wouldn't expect for a Thursday."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Skeptical Chymist for several years and I am almost always extremely happy with the experience.  My husband and I typically like to go when they're having their \"Pub Quiz\" trivia night each week and we have also visited during special holiday events (St Paddy's Day, etc;)..  
Service is always friendly.. I have waited a little too long on busier nights, but I chalk that up to being in a crowded bar with people shouting out questions to the trivia caller.  It is a bit chaotic, but not uncomfortable and I've never had bad or rude service from the waitstaff or the bar.  
The food is tasty!  There is a plentiful selection of plenty of typical bar food and they pull it off easily.. They also have a nice offering of Irish-inspired choices and what we've sampled have all been very good.  The prices are quite reasonable and there is a different drink special every night - sometimes beers, sometimes cocktails - so our bill is never \"too high\".
The decor inside is really fantastic.  They've taken on the idea of a classic Dublin apothecary (with one side larger room that would be good for daytime lunch meetings styled as a library).. It is dark with plenty of tables and chairs and it is kept comfortably cool inside (but not freezing).  The patio is well lit and clean, so it's a nice place to wander during the nicer Arizona months.
Overall, I greatly enjoy my visits to Skeptical Chymist.  It's more interesting than your average bar/pub and the food is definitely fresher than anything you'll find at the average chain."}
{"text":"An excellent little Irish pub with good beer and authentic food. Ive had the fish and chips a few times and its always excellent. Had the shepherds pie today and was inspired to write a good review. Attentive service and \"football\" on the big screen..a solid experience."}
{"text":"This is a fun pub to meet up with friends for a pint - but the food isn't anything to rave about. They have great Happy Hour specials and a fun trivia night. Their big patio is a plus, too.

It's kind of in a wierd location though - hard to find - and parking isn't that great.

They also have a friendly staff - so I always like sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or happy hour.  Decorated like an old Irish pub, complete with old looking wood tables and bar.  Nice selection of off menu draught beers.  Happy hour specials are great prices for both food and drinks.  Nicely busy even with 3 other bars in the same center.  Outside tolerable at 105 with misters. Most tables filled by 5:30pm. Recommend for business lunch or meeting friends after work."}
{"text":"I haven't done bar trivia in a long time, so coming here with some smart Yelp folk seemed as good a time as ever to give it a go once again.

The food selection was typical bar food with an extra something here and there.  I had the bar wings and a few $4 Smithwick's.   Our waitress was very attentive and split our checks at the end of the night without a gripe.  The trivia itself was pretty challenging, I think I had some useful input for maybe a few answers.  And between rounds they gave out random prizes, I got a Rubik's Cube for chugging the rest of my beer!    

I might not be the smartest cookie at trivia, but when it comes to beer chugging I don't mess around!"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for years and in fact my son raves about the fish dinner he gets from here. I finally went when a friend dragged me for trivia night. So glad she did because this place is quite good. The atmosphere is eclectic and very comfortable. You feel like they want your business which as a customer I certainly appreciate. my drink was refilled over 4 times and I never asked. The food was delicious. We all got something different and each of us said it was great. We also tried a desert to share and it was enormous and definitely was good for 3 or 4 people. We weren't able to finish it. I highly recommend this charming place and I plan to return and try some of the dishes I read about in the reviews. I played it safe with a green  chili burger but it was spectacular. Very unique.  My friend had the appetizer tacos which she said were spicy and delicious. The other people both had specialty burgers. Loved this place-will return."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite some time since the days of when they first opened.  The bar has started to see better days with the chairs and interior seeming a little old and run down.  When they first opened they had some of the better burgers in the area but something has changed.  The food is still decent and not bad by a long shot but it's not what it once was.  

I ordered the Beef Wellington, while the dish was tasty and how many bars can you go to these days that even offer that as a dish but it wasn't put together the best and was falling apart after bite #2.  Good place to come see some live music and enjoy a Guinness but it's definitely a place that looks better with a big crowd and in the darkness"}
{"text":"Love this place normally but obnoxious and loud \"musician\" on Wednesday nights will keep our group away every time. Calling out people eating dinner with friends and making insulting comments was very unnecessary. Very disappointed to hear he's there every Wednesday night. No more work groups there during the dinner hour that night going forward. Dinner crowd cleared out shortly after blaring sound started. You would think the staff would alert management that their tips are impacted by this. Last table of 8 I host there. Sorry friends!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!  We came here for lunch on St Patrick's Day & had the \"unluck\" of the Irish by having a clueless server. It took 58 MINUTES for our food to arrive!  Given they were very busy, she should have known after 30 minutes that something was wrong!  We tried to be very patient and waited and waited and waited.  The table next to us were vacated and the next group came in and got their food while we were still being patient and was waiting for our food.  Then the table to the other side of us was once again vacated and two men sat down.  At this time, I decided to check my iPhone as I had checked into Yelp right after we placed our order and noticed that it had been more than 40 minutes since!

Meanwhile, I was starting to really get hungry and started to get clammy, shaky and started sweating.  I grabbed our server and told her that I wasn't feeling too good because I was too hungry, my sugar level was really low and asked for orange juice or a piece of bread.  She came back with a side order of fries to \"tide\" us over as the kitchen was still working on our order.  One of us told her to check and see that maybe our order was misplaced in the pipeline... She said that she was really trying and that the kitchen was just too busy.  This was hard to fathom as the restaurant had a set menu of about 5 items!

Suddenly the table with the two men got served!  They ordered fish and chips and started eating and still no food for our table!  We had ordered two orders of fish and chips and 3 salads.  How long does it take to prepare this?????????

We once again asked the waitress where our food was and asked her how the the two men got served before us when they came way after we did... Same answer.

Anyways, the food finally came and we were starving, we ate, she brought us the bill, no apologies, no remorse, etc... We paid the bill in full, even gave her a 20% tip.

I would be very SKEPTICAL about the SKEPTICAL CHYMIST!!!!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place.  It's a big place, with plenty of outdoor seating as well.  I love the Irish pub feel, although the outdoor pub facade in a strip mall was kind of weird.  Old pub feel inside, with some decent happy hour and reverse happy hour specials, good food, and good beer on tap.  Plus I live right around the corner.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Shepard's Pie is legit, made with lamb, and came with some very thick bread. Reuben was made with brisket instead of the usual corned beef, which was an interesting twist. All served by a helpful and personable waitress."}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband's go to restaurant.  We usually go out to dinner on Friday nights and we normally go to Skeptical Chymist!  The food here is fantastic, and this is saying a lot since we never thought we'd find a decent, reasonably priced place to eat after we moved here from the Midwest.  We've tried more than half of the menu items and never had a bad meal.  We go after he gets out of work so their happy hour specials are still available (50% off appetizers.)  Even if we're a couple of minutes late they still ALWAYS give us the happy hour discount, just ask!  We usually split a few appetizers and share a bread pudding dessert which is more than enough for dinner.

Although I have many favorites, if I was forced to only recommend one item off the menu it would be the braised rib sliders!  They are absolutely fantastic; the meat is extremely tender and flavorful.  I wish they would make an entrée sized portion of the sliders (HINT HINT!)  The bread pudding is also to die for.  Even if my husband and I are stuffed we still always get it!  The Baileys cream sauce they cover it with is so good I could eat of bowl of it by itself.

I love the atmosphere as well.  It doesn't feel like you're in North Scottsdale anymore, it's very relaxed and fun!  We've always had great service; the waitresses are quick and attentive."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now. It's near work and when ever a co-worker leaves the company, we have a nice sendoff for them here.

The food here is excellent!!! My favorite is the Date & Black Pepper flat bread. However, their fish and chips are great too.

Happy hour prices are decent too.

Want to eat, drink and watch the game? This place is perfect. Want to have a deep conversation with a group of friends? You won't be able to hear each other. They need some sound absorption, because even with a small group of people, you can't hear each other because of all the hard reflective surfaces."}
{"text":"Came by this nice, cornered bar after the Phoenix Open for some food and enjoyed the atmosphere. Ordered some wings, which were pretty tasty and quite fantastic! My friend and I noticed the live music flyer - will definitely be back to check it out along with tasting some other dishes! Maybe for St. Patty's Day :)"}
{"text":"This is my most favorite Irish Bar in all of Phoenix! The food and the staff are fantastic and the patio is great. The Chymist is my spot to watch all the football (soccer) matches as well. :)"}
{"text":"Good selection of beers. Seasonals were well picked. Waiter was very knowledgeable about beers too and made excellent recommendations.  Aussie Jim was playing guitar and singing which made the night. Very fun! I'll be back."}
{"text":"A beautiful Irish pub, not the best location. It is pretty hidden in a strip mall in north Scottsdale. I had a Magner's Irish Cider and the Fish & Chips. The fish and chips were good, but not great. Our server was a friendly gal & there was an Irish lad working behind the bar which really added to the nice Irish pub ambiance. We came in for lunch on a quiet afternoon. I would like to return on a more lively night and review it again then!"}
{"text":"Arrived here for lunch today with my colleague at around 12:45pm. Place had a few occupied tables. You seat yourself. We sat close to the patio door. We went through their menu and saw they had very interesting choices. Since I have now gone completely dairy free (& will be for at least a while),I had to choose an option that was completely dairy free so I chose the Belfast Burger but ordered it without cheese and without the onion ring (because it is beer battered). My colleague ordered the Ruben. Both order came by default with fries. I decided to also order a second side which was coleslaw. Food was served in pretty good time. The burger was pretty big and very filling especially with the fries and coleslaw. Coleslaw tasted fresh and the fries were then and crispy enough. My colleague said their Ruben was also pretty good. 

Other menu items on the menu that fought my attention were Beef Wellington (which I am dying to try) and the Lamb Shepherd's pie. 

Prices are average leaning more towards expensive. My burger was $12.99 with fries, not a bad deal though considering the beef patty was pretty big and made with real meat! 

Worth trying and the service is pretty good and fast so can be a good option for lunch if you work next door. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give Skeptical Chymist 2 stars to average out my recent 4 star visit and my 2 recent 2 star ones.


I really want to like Skeptical. 
They have everything I like:  Their food is very good and well priced. They have excellent specials and a huge and thoughtful craft beer menu. Plus, it's just a cool, local one of a kind place.

What's the problem?  Hostility.

It's a coin toss as to how you'll be treated.  I've been there probably 10 times.  One time it's great, and next time you're treated like an unwelcome intruder.

Last night was the latter.  

The waitress clearly did not want to be there.  She conveyed agitation from the first moment she approached our table.  She mumbled, slouched and shuffled.  

We expressed an interest in the Red Hook Beers on special.  She gestured toward a poster on the wall, clearly intending that we get up, go read the poster and not trouble her by asking her to verbalize what Red Hook beers they have.  

She left, we walked over to read the poster and ordered our selections. 
 \"We're out of all Red Hook beers\" she then informs us. 
 
She impatiently demands our \"plan B\" beer selection.  My wife was reading the beer menu.  The waitress asks me what beer I want.  
I said \" I'm waiting my turn to see the list\" 

She let out a sigh of contempt and just walked away.

Monday is $5 Cheeseburgers, which is a fantastic deal.  My son ordered one.
As I ordered mine, she barked over me as I spoke:

\"I'll have to charge you for the water\"

What? 

\"I'm going to charge you for water\"  

Why are you going to charge for a glass of water? 

\"Because you have to order a drink for that deal and he (gesturing toward my son) only has water.\"

What a very charming diplomat you are, miss. 
He'll have a Coke, thank you so much for asking.

The food was good but again the waitress just had this impatient \"I hate everyone\" attitude the whole time. 
 
Later we asked \"Can we order more beer before happy hour ends?  She just says \"Yes\" and keeps walking.  

We looked at the board, read the menu and carefully select which beers we wanted.  
She shows up with 2 glasses of what we had ordered at first.  

I said \"What are these?\" 

 \"Your beers\"  

\"We didn't order our second beers yet\"

\"These are what you ordered before\"

\"We didn't want those again, we wanted something different\"

\"Oh\" ...and left them anyway, sighed (again) and walked away. 

End of discussion.

No \"sorry\"
No \"What did you want?\" 
No anything,  just \"Oh\" as in \"I will put that on my list of things about which I do not care\"

Interestingly, she disappeared 3/4 of the way though the service and someone else took over.

Expect good food, and a theoretically good beer selection but do not expect good service because this is not the first time the level-of-service-coin toss landed tails up.."}

{"text":"waitstaff very inattentive.The table next to us asked 3 different employees to take their drink/food order and each one said 'it wasn't their area' but they'd get someone right away. We wanted to order more drinks and the waitress was never around to flag her down & she didn't check back with us until she brought the check.

Food was fine, but not much in the way of Irish pub food.The atmosphere is terrific!. There r other Irish pubs in the area that are MUCH better. Check them out before u trying this place"}
{"text":"Thank you, Skeptical Chymist of Scottsdale, for ruining our wedding reception. I've been in the service industry for long enough to know that this was a disaster. The food was fine, the waitress we had was great, but the GM was a terror. He has been ambiguous about the event details the entire time I've been planning. I had given him a card number for payment months in advance. He did not run the card, even after I asked him about not running the card. Contrary to the contract I signed, I was charged for the entire amount of the bill all at once. My debit card said 'oh hell no' to the massive charge and when we tried to work out something with the GM we were yelled at and basically held hostage under threat of prosecution until we could get my Dad to come bail us out. Our poor server was so upset, my Dad said she was in tears over it. What should have been a special day for us was a nightmare."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place, maybe it's the location, maybe it's the crowd, but there's just no vibe here. The ambiance is cool, the little patio is nice. But I'm just not \"feelin it\" when I come here. The food is good, the drink prices aren't amazing but they're alright. I give this place a shrug and a \"meh\" rating."}
{"text":"Living near Boston, we know Irish!
This place plays the part well. We didn't eat, sat at the bar and had a few pints of Guinness and participated in the trivia. I don't know why more bars don't do more interactive stuff (like trivia) anymore, seems like the customer really enjoy it. Anyway, a huge beer menu on a blackboard behind the bar is rather helpful. Fun visit & I would definitely go back. The only downfall is the place is a pain in the rear to find, tucked away in the nook of a mini mall. May the luck of the Irish be with you!"}
{"text":"$5 any burger with a side on Mondays!  That's worth the trip but this place has lost some of its Irish charm and seems grungier.  It is a good place to catch live music & a variety of beers.   For big sporting events be sure to show up early or else you'll be stuck with standing room.  Also plan on walking a little for parking."}
{"text":"This is a solid place. The music was a little too loud when I was there last, but this is a good place to meet with friends and have a nice drink. Low key, especially for Scottsdale, down to earth place.
I didn't partake of the food, but the cider I had was exactly what I needed.
The place is located right near Ray's Pizza too, so that's never a bad thing."}
{"text":"Great Shepards Pie. Make sure to put some HP Sauce on top. Goes great with a pint."}
{"text":"Worst experience. Yes it is St. Patrick's Day so I expected a long wait. 3 of us paid our $10 each cover charge, no problem. Found a seat, hooray. It goes downhill from there.

Absolutely worst server. Waited 20 minutes before she asks what we want to drink. Another 10 minutes and we order. We order corned beef and cabbage...standard St. Patrick's Day fare right? Then we wait 45 minutes before she tells us that they are OUT of corned beef and cabbage. It was only 7:30 pm. Not good planning. Disappointed  we order alternate meals. 

Another 45 minutes go by before we ever see her again and we ask what the delay is and her response is \"well we are kind of busy you know\". Really? Then she says it will be at least another 30 minutes. We said forget it. Told her she should refund our cover charge to which she ignores us and turns her back. Comes back with a bill for our drinks. 

Best part is she asks me if I want my burger in a box to go. I didn't order a burger. Geez. 

$42 for 2 sodas and a weak beer and we went somewhere else for dinner. 

Won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Okay service.  Decent food.  Great atmosphere.  Felt like I was in Europe for a minute."}
{"text":"Ok atmosphere. Ok service. Terrible food. Great beer on tap. Overall, really below average food for the area. Everything is deep fried and fatty but tasteless. Not rushing back... Unless I'm only thirsty and it's happy hour."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for happy hour (4-7 pm everyday) in North Scottsdale. The service is always excellent, obviously management knows how to hire servers. I believe all the apps are $5.

The food is outstanding whether you're eating from the happy hour menu or the regular menu. Three Lamb Skewers are placed on top of a salad. Dip the lamb into the cilantro yoghurt and you will be very happy. The salad is topped off with a few tiny nuts and the house salad dressing really adds to the flavor of the salad. This $5 happy hour appetizer would be a dinner for most of you ladies out there. The four mouth watering Braised Rib Sliders are accompanied by horse radish cream, BBQ Sauce, onion strings and swiss cheese. Let's not forget the 2 crab cakes that are actually made of real crab. The crab cake appetizer makes my wife very happy if you know what I mean. Did I mentioned that the chicken tenders with honey mustard are an excellent choice as well. Or how about the Flat Bread? They have many different types of flat bread. All of the flat breads are tasty.

The only drawback is that sometimes the smoke from the patio over powers the dinning room. They have live music after happy hour. Did I mention that the beer is cold? I love the Skeptical Chymist because it consistently delivers on the quality of food, drinks, entertainment and service."}
{"text":"St. Patrick's Day here was absolutely the worst attempt at a \"block party\" I've ever seen. $10 cover to be herd into their parking lot! Literally tent city with a U2 cover band. Me and 4 others came here anticipating to rake up a hefty tab and enjoy ourselves for as long as they'd have us. 
I knew we picked the wrong wannabe \"premiere Irish pub experience\" right away. There were no clear instructions on what was going on with the actual bar/restaurant. Just a line out the door with a separate lame \"party\" going on in their parking lot. Pre poured beers and a single line for corned beef and cabbage, literally nothing else. 2 of us decide to wait in line for the actual restaurant while the rest fend for themselves outside, nursing flat beers in their parking lot.. we finally get to the front of the line. My friend stays in line to get us a table while I gather the other 3 in our party from the parking lot. We walk back to our spot in the queue and find out the hard way from a mouthy cop and what I presume was the gm/owner letting people in to the restaurant that we had apparently really messed up. \"What the F*** do you think you are doing\" \"why the f*** do you think you are better than everyone else behind you? *(8-10 people lackadaisically in the queue behind us awaiting a table)*\", the loser \"playing\" bouncer and the stereotypical jerk cop exclaim. We didn't know any better than to presume we had a table. I explain this to the both of them and they both just claim that what is going on inside is no different than what is going on out here in the parking lot. \"Tables are a free for all good luck\", the \"head honcho\" exclaims. Great! Glad me and my friends donated $50 to your establishment to be treated like thugs and told to stay in your parking lot! I'll never come back here and you shouldn't either. We wound up at twin peaks and spent $300, tipped their incredible service 40%."}
{"text":"Really cool irish pub that I never would have found out about if it wasn't for my friends who frequent it. (It's in the corner of a strip mall extending from pima to flw near the wendys in case you can't find it) We came on a wednesday night, relatively late, so there were only appetizers being served (1/2 off) and 1/2 priced drafts (any) and wines. Pretty sweet deal. The bar wasn't too crowded, but there were some groups there watching games on tv, so I could imagine on busier nights it could get really loud/rowdy. Tuesday nights we saw were pub trivia nights, seems like each night has a special which is nice. The server was super nice and very accomodating. I'll definitely come back, maybe on a weekend to see how the crowd is then. The food is really good for bar food too, and not to pricey, especially when it's half off =)"}
{"text":"Checked out the Skeptical Chymist last night and was seriously disappointed by the food.  Had the Cod Cakes and they were unacceptable.  Basically, it tasted like someone took several scoopfuls of Shake N' Bake, mixed them with with a VERY small amount of fishy substance and baked it.  There was a decent side of mac salad but it was room temperature which makes me a little queasy.  

I'll go back for drinks but I'll stay away from the \"pub grub.\""}
{"text":"Let's start this off by saying my love of the Seattle Seahawks and the fact that this is the official bar of the Arizona Seahawkers Association may tint my view of the place.

That being said I have gone to Skeptical on occasions other than Seahawks games, which for the record are an insanely fun event here, and enjoyed it.

Skeptical is an irish bar but the food is far from your typical irish fare although they have some of the classics like a shepherd's pie that is stellar. My favorite things to get here is the muscles in broth appetizer. Think of this as a bowl of incredibly flavored soup with garlic, leek and red pepper and the added bonus of having a generous serving of muscles and topped with bits of thick bacon. If that doesn't have your mouth watering maybe the kicker of a side of garlic toast will put you over the top.

They also feature a great selection of beers including rotating beers in bottles and on tap. The mainstays such as Guinness, Harp and Kilkenny are always flowing.

There are only two reasons that I have subtracted a star. The first for me is that I am not a fan of the flatbreads, I have tried several and none every hit the spot. Friends have had them and enjoyed but this just doesn't do it for me. The other is a hit and miss issue that has happened only for Seahawks games where I have felt that the servers have been somewhat unavailable and slacking when it comes to checking back in. I understand for big events they have lots of tables and are busy but even with that factored in there are some who just don't seem to care. The only reason I even mention this is because there are some who I have seen work their butts off to keep every drink filled and people happy. When the tables around me see their servers 3-4 times before I see mine, it's an issue.

Check them out but don't dare walk in here wearing enemy colors on game day unless you are prepared to hear all about it from the great fans that show up."}
{"text":"I was surprised with the burgers. They were big, meaty, very filling. The atmosphere of the place was really fun as well. They did take a long time to serve us, also it took a while for food to be prepared, however all-in-all this place was fun."}
{"text":"With its finely appointed decor resembling a pub straight out of Dublin, the Skeptical Chymist is a visual funhouse, offering sanctuary to the pub-goer looking for something different. 

A large chalkboard behind the bar lists a wide variety of handcrafted brews with alcohol contents ranging from five, to the much higher ten percent range typically found in double IPA's. I'm pleasantly surprised with each visit to see the constantly changing offerings. 

Their happy hour menu features five dollar flatbreads that are absolutely scrumptious. But the piece de resistance is their corned beef and cabbage; a true delight with its perfectly cooked cabbage and  generous portion of corned beef slathered in a mustard onion demi-glace. 

Kudos to our server who was quick to forewarn how the dish comes with a 'gravy', for had she not done so, I'm certain I would have been repulsed upon seeing my corned beef smothered in a brown gravy. 
At first, we were both confused, our thoughts swimming around the idea of how gravy could add anything to corned beef. But this gravy is different. 
They call it gravy, but it's an onion based demi glace with a slight hint of deli mustard which if you can believe, accents the corned beef into a culinary triumph.

One IPA, and a plate of corned beef for lunch and I found myself flat on the couch an hour later, sleeping Sunday afternoon away like a newborn, as Sundays are meant to be.

During the week, the Chymist is a fun retreat from work, with its all ages crowd, cigar-friendly patio, and extremely fair happy hour prices.
The Chymist is a great place to unwind, or, have a fine meal that in no way resembles typical bar food. 
 
I should probably mention how I've yet to find an unfriendly server or slow service. 
That's not to say the service is somewhat slower when packed, but if you're there to pound brews instead of enjoying the moment, you'll likely disagree with this review.

Overall, nice job SC management."}
{"text":"The Skeptical Chymist (15688 N. Pima Road, Scottsdale, AZ 85260) is a bit of Ireland, right here in Scottsdale. The minute you enter The Skeptical Chymist, traditional apothecary items originally purchased in Ireland surround you.  Dark wood surrounds your every turn, even a side room named after the pub's namesake book written by Robert Boyle of Cork, Ireland.  The 1627 book written by Robert Boyle, became the foundation for modern day chemistry.  I have always found Irish pubs in America tie a great story related to an Irish native or product from Ireland. 

Their menu includes appetizers, flatbread sandwiches, soups and salads, burgers, entrees and a small dessert selection.  Irish entrée specialties include Real Lamb Shepherd's Pie, Corned Beef and Cabbage, and Fish & Chips.

Their Fish & Chips platter ($14.00 dinner portion) includes a large piece of battered cod, along with French fries, tangy coleslaw and tartar sauce.  Their fish is fried and tastes delicious, especially with malt vinegar drizzled generously on top.  Their fries are ample, lining the whole entire plate under the large piece of cod.  You find a hint of garlic within this combination of soft and crispy fries.  Their entrée items can be paired with other sides including, scalloped potatoes, green beans, salad, cole slaw or their soup of the day. 

Accompanying the fish and chips, their Lost Coast Brewery IPA (which was a special of the day) is a red bitter brew, but a bitter that grows less with each taste.  If a red brew is not for your choosing, you can select one of their many draft beers available as well as wine by the glass.  They offer a happy hour each day from 4-7 p.m., $2.00 off their beer and wine.

The Skeptical Chymist brings a touch of Ireland, both in atmosphere and food.  Stop by today and you will not come away hungry or thirsty.  Slainte!"}
{"text":"The Skeptical Chymist is a great North Scottsdale bar for happy hour or dinner/drinks before going out.  

I went a few weeks ago with a group of friends where we did just that.  We all bellied up to the bar which probably wasnt the most ideal spot for the 12 of us but the rest of the tables were full so we made do.  The bartender was really attentive and the food came out quickly.  My friend and I split the chicken tenders which, in true Irish fashion, are extremely battered but equally delicious.  

Music was probably louder than it actually needed to be, it was pretty hard to hear anything anyone was saying when the live band played, but when the playlist came on, the volume was just about right.  

Fun time had by all, different, tad older crowd than I'm used to, and it was a nice change of pace.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is owned by the same guy who owns Fibber McGee's on the southeast part of town. However, there is a night and day difference between the two locations. While Fibber McGee's is a small dim lit pub styled bar... The Skeptical Chemist is more open, well lit and more spacious for large capacity seating. The bar shelves behind the bar itself are in the rustic wooden frames that imitate old pharmacies. It still has a pub feel but in a more modern way that suits Scottsdale.

The whiskey list is fairly impressive for a moderate price category. They have everything from the lower styles of Jack, Jim and Johnny up to single malts, extra distilled, sherry flavored styles. I have been in here numerous times and have not been disappointed in my experience. Now, I will say this though... one time I believe that the bartender was either really really tired or partaking in the libations as well if you catch my drift. But besides that, I enjoy the atmosphere and the drink variety here.

Decent spot if you want a different scene than the traditional bar, pub or club up in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"This is your classic Irish Pub located right in the middle of a busy N Scottsdale strip mall, and if you don't know that it's tucked away in the corner, then you will most likely drive rt past it!

If you are from back east or the midwest you will fall in love with this place ... It's old school decor & ambiance sets it apart from the modernized Irish pubs that are out there.

The thing that sets this Pub apart from others is it's delicious food - they offer quite an extensive menu, and in my opinion it has the best corn beef & cabbage in the metro-phoenix area.  They also have great soups, salads, shepherds pie, and of course and AMAZING beer selection!!

The only downfall is that the service here can be inconsistent - sometimes I have had great servers and other times (if they are busy) it can be rough to get a drink/food/ or someone to acknowledge your mere existence.

They also mix it up w/ Trivia nights and sometimes have small groups, musicians, bands, etc.  If you have never been here ... You must check it out!! The best part is that it's the total opposite of the typical snobby superficial scottsdale watering hole - so you will find/meet a lot of cool down to earth people here, which is always a breath of fresh air!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a value! They have great beer and whiskey menu but the food was a real surprise: this is no ordinary \"bar food\" no, the Steak Salad was top notch, as good as any fine dining restaurant. So good beer AND good food?! Good job Skeptical Chemist!"}
{"text":"Their Happy Hour and Sunday prices are great.  I've had a few items off their menu and have really enjoyed everything I've tried.  They pour a great Guiness and that's one of the key components of a good pub (in my opinion).  If you like pubs and work in North Scottsdale then try it for HH sometime."}
{"text":"I had the distinct pleasure of making the acquaintance of the King of our fair city earlier this week. At his behest, we met up at The Skeptical Chymist.

At first glance, I was nervous that the venue would be incredibly small. It's tucked away in the corner of a shopping center, between a sandwich shop and a Rubio's. The storefront is immensely wide, but for some reason, it didn't appear that it would be very spacious inside.

To say that I was wrong would be putting it lightly. When I walked up to the \"Please Seat Yourself\" sign where a hostess might stand during peak hours, I was immediately lost. There was a vast section in the center of the bar that was teeming with people there to enjoy the amazing happy hour specials (from 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm). I had to actually walk around to the right side of this group (through a small seated dining section) to reach the bar.

I only had a moment to gaze at the bar while waiting for Scott D. to arrive. In that time, I noticed several different beers with which I am, sadly, not yet familiar. Though, after the night I enjoyed, I'm sure we will not be strangers for very long.

When Scott D. arrived, we ordered a nice stout beer (I'm ashamed to say that I was too nervous to pay attention to the name of the ale). Scott said that it's a good idea to \"start from the left, and work your way to the right\" of the beers on tap. On this night, we never made it past the first tap.

We picked up our ales, and headed to the outdoor patio (another pleasant surprise).  The patio was surrounded by misters, which I'm sure, offer great relief during the blistering summer months. There was a television in the corner of the patio that was airing the Thursday night NFL game. There was a walk up bar that connected to the bar in the main room. 

At first, it appeared that we got lost in the mix, as it took a while before a waiter came around to see how we were doing. But, once they realized their mistake, they were exceptionally quick to rectify the situation. Our server, whose name escapes me, was incredibly courteous and apologetic for the delay. He asked if we were interested in appetizers...which, after the strong ale, we absolutely were!

Scott recommended the \"Pulled Pork Sliders\". Perhaps it was the beer, perhaps it was the situation. But the sliders were great! They come four to a plate (perfect for sharing). And since it was happy hour, we got them at half price ($5.00).

As the night progressed, there was another round of the same beer. That, subsequently, led to another appetizer. For this round, Scott suggested the Chicken Tenders. Being happy hour, we only paid $4.50 for this dish. Just like before, this dish comes with four chicken tenders, making for another easy mathematical conclusion as to which way the dish should be split. I know they were chicken, but the manner in which these tenders are fried, they reminded me more of fried fish. Whatever the case may be, they were scrumptious.

Cue the third round of beers, again from the same tap. (Now I HAVE to return, just so I can figure out what this beer is called!) 

We sat, we drank, we ate, and we were merry. We ended up chatting for more than three hours over drinks and bar fare. So, if you were paying attention, you know that we each had three stout ales and two delicious appetizers during our little pow wow. 

By the time the tab came, I had completely forgotten that we had been drinking and dining on Happy Hour prices. The damage was an astounding $40.00...including a generous tip! 

As we exited the bar (three plus hours later), it dawned on me that there was a stage upon which live music acts performed! This place is WAY bigger than I had originally though!  

And did I mention the \"Library\"? I fear I may have said too much already...perhaps when I return, I'll venture into the rest of the nooks and crannies of this local gem!

That wraps it up for my 50th review. I know, to some, 50 reviews isn't an impressive milestone. But, to me, this one was special. And, after all, everybody has to start somewhere!

I hope you enjoy both the review and the venue!"}
{"text":"Ok, so here's the skinny on Skeptical Chymist.  I work near this hidden gem, and also attend weekly trivia, so I've experience both day and night outings on a regular basis here.

The service is something to be desired.  There always seems to be an ever changing staff of waitresses, one after the next seem indifferent to prompt service after the intial, \"What'd you like for drink?\"  Don't get me wrong, there are a few waiters/waitresses that have been there for a while and they're awesome...but there's more than a handful that need to either shape up or shove off.

The food - there's pretty much nothing bad on the menu here.  Mussels - AMAZING, and the broth is even tastier than the mussels themselves!  Rasher burger - I'd get it every time if my doctor allowed me to.  Flatbreads - not too much here, if you're hungry, don't waste your money on these.  Steak salad - my personal favorite, though after they recently raised the prices, it's a little hard to stomach a $14 salad.

Also, don't get soda or mixed drinks here...it tastes funky and the owners know about it.  They've been \"working on it\" for nearly three years now."}
{"text":"We met friends there on Monday and discovered their fabulous burgers. Had my jalapeno burger with no bun and a salad. YUM! Husband had the bleu burger with fries, and thought his dinner was delicious. We shared an order with our friends of the cod sliders, OMG, outstanding! The owner himself delivered our meal and was so friendly.  I love mom & pop restaurants, and this is one I would definitely recommend.  Would definitely go back. Can't wait to try more of their menu.  Ambiance is fun and original."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and the band was really good! I wish I found out the name of the band because the lead singer had a really great voice! 
My husband and I came here with 4 other friends whom we've known since college and were trying to catch up on each other's lives over a few beers and food. Maybe it wasn't the brightest idea to choose some place with a live band and drunk people to catch up, since it was hard to hear each other talk, but oh well, we had a great time anyway. 
I suggest getting the short rib flat bread. It really made an impression on us, so we would definitely order it again. I think we also ordered the bacon onion jalepeno, which was pretty good. I ate the corned beef and cabbage for my entree, which I cannot make an impartial judgement about, simply because I love corned beef and cabbage and I loved it here. Our waiter was super friendly and had so much to talk about to, so he was very entertaining. 
I ordered Guinness with my meal, so unfortunately I didn't try some of the other beers. That will be my goal the next time we go back, because I guarantee that we will be back there, hopefully for happy hour next time!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with kind of an apothecary look. Good service. Quite a few craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"The name does not note what this establishment is. This is an Irish bar with a wide range of beer and other alcoholic accoutrements to fancy your pallet.

Lacking on the gluten free side. Twyla is Ciliac and we were hard pressed to find something to eat. The ambiance is good and this is a hard core Seattle Seahawks bar. I'm not sure how to correlate Ireland and Seattle? However, there must be a tie in somewhere.  

Our service was really slow (read my reviews, I never complain) but they created double work for themselves by not combining tasks. It took forever for them to see my c.c on the table. Overall, I'm sure this joint rocks and the flow is good. We came in when it was slow and there was no drive to get us serviced. I'm am an Irish Cat and dig on Irish fare. We will be back soon with anticipation of the real deal.

{"text":"Very little Irish or British about this bar with the exception of the fact that they have Harp and Guinness on tap and they show Premier League matches at times. The selection is very limited in respect to Irish / UK beer. The music is typical American spots bar.

Other than that it's just another bar. Avoid the cheese plate."}
{"text":"Best Corn Beef and Cabbage ever. Good burgers. Great daily specials. Great selection of beers."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. It never disappoints. They even expanded their beer selection to support Hop Heads like me. The food is always great."}
{"text":"Chris has always been our favorite waiter. His beard is awesome and incredibly think and dark. But seriously whenever I sit down and see Chris heading to our barrel, I know it's going to be a good night at SC."}

Good selection of craft beers posted on a chalk board.I tried a burger and it was soggy and uninspired. Go for the drinks but don't eat."}

{"text":"Great corned beef and cabbage!  Staff is amazing.  Very friendly atmosphere.highly recommend stoping by for some traditional Irish food."}

Definitely recommend if your looking for an authentic Irish pub and some great food. Service was very good and prices were reasonable. All in all great experience :) Will go again!"}
{"text":"Despite the crazy name, this is a great Irish Pub. Love the food. Very fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I seriously can't believe this place has had any bad reviews!! I went with my husband and plenty of friends a few times and we've had nothing but a great time, great food and great service. Best place to watch a Seahawks game too!! Go hawks!!"}
{"text":"Just because I'm a huge Seahawks fan doesn't mean I let it effect my reviews... but because I'm a huge Seahawks fan I've been here on more than one occasion and their game day specials are really great.

I have never been here on a day when the Hawks aren't playing and that probably won't change... but when they are and I don't have another place to watch the game, I'll probably be there.

The service has always been friendly and the drinks are always cold.  I have had a few random bites of food there and it has all been legit.  They always have raffles including a pretty hefty 50/50 one that almost got up to $1,000 yesterday.

I imagine if you're not a Seahawks fan you should certainly avoid this place on Sunday - you'll hate it.  Just my two cents, but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool quirky little bar.  Almost a neighborhood bar. Great service and good beverages.  Parking sucks because of the shopping center, but don't let that deter you.  Everyone should come here once.  Trivia games are a lot of fun too."}
{"text":"I was a skeptic of this chemist of brew.

Needless to say, I wasn't too far off.  This is great for a night out with the boys to watch the game.  That's all I can say since I wouldn't recommend coming here to chat.  

I ordered me a beer and some fried fish and chips.  I don't like soggy food, but I guess that's how it comes here.  The fried fish was laid on top of my garlic fries, which were way greasy.  As the fish and fries came together it was a hot soggy mess.  I might want to add tasteless too.

The place definitely has a pub look and feel.  Live music when I came that night, but the football game was going on too.  Rowdy fans and loud music doesn't go well, but I guess it wouldn't matter after a few drinks.  Our service was good, but splitting checks again can be a challenge. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best beer really great food best service around town!!! Corn beef and cabbage is the top best for sure! And all there all food is best, this only place I go all the time"}
{"text":"Good food, good beer.  A decent Irish pub in outer Scottsdale, I'd recommend it if you're in the mood.  All the same, it's not a must experience either.  The bread pudding is a bit mushy, but tastes really, really good."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and always enjoy this place.  It's tucked away in the back of a strip shopping center but is worth the effort to find for a bite to eat and a beer.

The menu is basically bar food with an Irish twist.  I like their burgers and flatbreads.

What really sets this place apart is it's amazing selection of craft beers.  They always have 10-12 selections on draught and another 10-12 in bottles.  These beers are well diversified by brewery and style.

This last visit I had an outstanding Boulder Shake Chocolate Porter.  They also offer tasting flights so you can try lots of different beers while you are there.

I'm a 49ers fan so I wish they'd tone down the Seahawks theme but I guess that's my problem!"}
{"text":"Best Seahawks bar in the country!! Great service, people, drinks, and food! Tons of fun to watch Seahawks and Huskies games!!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the husky game. It was our first time and heard it was good to watch the games! The place was filled with husky fans(always a good sign) we got there early so we were able to find a table, recommend coming an hour or two before a game starts. The food was AMAZING! We ordered the pretzel(my fav, they were sooo fluffy), fries, and all you can eat fish n chips. Service was attentive and the atmosphere was great. I felt as if I was in my own living room watching the game, doesn't get better then that!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a big fan of getting food that has ingredients that aren't mentioned on the menu.  Not just my meal but my friends had food that wasn't exactly what we ordered."}
{"text":"I had a blast at Skeptical Chymist last night... Thanks again to the yelpers that came out for trivia - Although 'Team Yelp Yourself' didn't win any major prizes, we sure had fun!  

I love the atmosphere at SC - so laid back and the staff is friendly as can be!  I wasn't sure I'd be able to find a light bite to eat (I was expecting heavy Irish bar food), but I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed my house salad with salmon. I sampled the curry fries from Kelly B and dare I say they were the best I've had?!  I would go back just for those!  Delicious!  Both items went well with the Strongbow apple cider too. Thanks again, Jolene (my waitress) for your recommendations!

I look forward to checking out live music at Skeptical Chymist another time soon... or perhaps returning once I brush up on my trivia knowledge.  Either way, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Two stars due to overall disappointment in the venue.    
PROS:   Fish and Chips were excellent in my opinion, and the bread pudding was outstanding.    CONS:   No one to even say \"hello\" when you come in the door.    Just a greeter would be nice and helpful for a first timer.    Service was spotty throughout the evening.    Most wait staff are more than happy to bring you another drink before you finish the previous one to keep their bill moving up for a better tip, but that wasn't the case here.     The biggest con was the MUSIC - first of all, waaaay too loud indoors.   This isn't a dance club, so it doesn't need to dominate.   It was a conversation killer.    Secondly, it's St. Patrick's weekend, and we're listening to country music???     It just didn't align for us.    An Irish Pub can't line up an Irish Folk Singer for the weekend?     I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We are here every Sunday for our Seahawks games. Servers are amazing, energy is great.... would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to watch football!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place a lot as I live in the neighborhood. I try not to go on Fridays, as they have $5 Irish car bombs that day and that is a temptation I don't need. Staff is okay. Usually too busy to be overlay attentive. Beers are great, food is pretty good. Fish and chips are tasty, and the appetizer flatbreads are great (and half off during happy hour). I can't say I have ever craved the food here, or felt I needed to visit, but when I have ended up here, it more than served its purpose."}
{"text":"Get the BEEF WELLINGTON!!!  sooo good and cooked just right.

Staff is friendly and good selection of brews.  Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"love this place. if you want to experience an Irish bar, this is as close as it gets. the staff is so friendly (and really from Ireland with that lovely accent)!  if you are in the area, stop by and have a pint. their happy hour is great. 1/2 off all apps, AND they are good!.  they also have live entertainment in the evenings. please support this local establishment. was in there last night, sunday, and the bartender was so nice and friendly. just what you want. have eaten here many times and food is good.  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"IMPORTANT NOTE

*Yelp Hot-Sheet Advertising Alert*

Yuppers, The Skeptical Chymist got on the Yelp advertising hot-sheet, but hey, that's cool, they paid for it, they deserve it. 

They're on Groupon too, so check there for current specials.

BACKGROUND 

So, after hiking with Black Status Yelp Elite Brett B, he suggested The Skeptical Chymist for drinks and grub. Who am I to refuse drinks and grub, so I said, \"Hell YA!\"

THE SKEPTICAL CHYMIST

In times gone by often a pharmacy or grocery would double as a pub.

Customers would tend to take a Guinness or whiskey to relieve their flagging spirits as they came to purchase their provisions. 

The name Skeptical Chymist came from a book written by Robert Boyle, a gentleman born in Cork, Ireland in 1627. 

The book became the cornerstone of modern day chemistry, and changed the thinking at the time of many apothecarists \"chymists.\"

Continuing the apothecary theme, Skeptical Chymist is host to many apothecary items dating back through the centuries. The majority of these items have been purchased in Ireland. 

As well as providing the people of Scottsdale a glimpse of Ireland, you can sample the delights of Irish cuisine and sip on many fine Irish beverages.

The Skeptical Chymist is owned by Trevor Kingston, who moved to the United States in 1996 thanks to a green card lottery, and opened the restaurant 12 years ago. 

When the Airpark-area eatery celebrated its 10-year anniversary, Kingston sent a couple on an all-expenses-paid trip to Ireland.

Skeptical Chymist is Kingston's second restaurant; he also owns Fibber Magees in Chandler.

Kingston's No. 1 priority is food, something the staff constantly evolves and tweaks. The menu emphasizes modern Irish food.

Skeptical Chymist offers quality products at a fair price. It goes beyond the standard restaurant or bar.

THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE

The Skeptical Chymist is in a strip mall called Sonora Village, off of Pima Road, in North Scottsdale, Arizona.

It looks like a wannabe true Irish Pub, but with Seattle Seahawks memorabilia: Neither are my cup-o-tea, and I don't remember the Irish in Ireland giving a damn about American Football, especially not the Seattle Seahawks in particular, but the owner, Trevor Kingston is an exception.

The place was pretty empty for a Sunday afternoon, so we got to pick where we sat, which was at the front of the class, er, I mean, bar.

Neither of us had been there before, so we picked the bartender's brain about the drink menu.

I tried the Berry Bourbon Smash, which I didn't like at all, so I made Brett B drink mine and got a Blue Moon with orange juice, which I loved.

Next we tackled the menu. I'm pretty sure we ordered one of everything. My favorite was the nachos with pulled pork on top. YUMMY!

The place started getting busier a little later, and I think we closed the place down.

I'm pretty sure we went throughout few shifts of bartenders too. All were ridiculously nice, helpful, and fun.

CONCLUSION

You know how sometimes you fall in love with the vibe of a place? Well, this place I didn't fall in love with, but I don't have anything negative to say either.

It's a solid strip mall North Scottsdale Irish pub.

It's nice here. I'd come back. 

4/5 RECOMMEND

{"text":"Really cool Irish pub camouflaged in the corner of a strip mall in NoSco....it's owned by the same guys who own Tim Finnegans and shares the same menu and pricing. Very good value proposition for Happy Hour, 1/2 price appetizers, beer specials. Appetizers are great, especially the short rib sliders, PEI mussels and lamb skeweres. Carlburg draft is always 3 bucks a pint, can't beat that anywhere! Service can be hit or miss unless you sit at the bar (which I prefer to do if I arrive as happy hour is ticking down), but servers are generally pleasant. Nice smoking patio with outdoor tv for the cigar smoking sports fans. 
Value proposition: 5 stars

The drinks are strong, there's not much of a crowd, which is a plus.

The Wings are pretty good.  The BBQ Jalapeno Burger though is amazing...yum!  Spicy and Sweet, a great combination!

I like the design/decor of the restaurant...it's an Irish Pub.  Irish Pub's make me want to eat and drink and be merry, ha!

{"text":"Probably my favorite local bar in the area. I am a little biased as it is the best Seahawks bar in town. Honestly I have watched games in Seattle at local pubs and I always have a better time here. Great friendly staff and one of the best selection of beers in the valley. Also a very good food menu as well. Everything ranging Irish food, flatbread, bar food, and even beef Wellington. Overall you can't go wrong here and you are always treated well by the staff."}
{"text":"We went here based on a friend's recommendation.  As she said it was hard to find.  Love the over all decor, feels like you are in an old pub.  The live music was also nice.  We ordered fish and chips and steak sandwich.  They would have been so much better if they were seasoned.  A little salt and pepper goes a long way.  Good liquor selection.  Will come back."}
{"text":"Ok, so even if your not a Seahawk fan, this place is the best Irish pub in the Phoenix area. Having been to Ireland I can tell you the atmosphere is charming with small details and large wood tables. If you get a chance to order the traditional Irish Breakfast, it's the best I've had here in the states. Also love their fish and chips. I have like everything I've had here. Great assortment of drafts and bottles if your just looking for a pint too. Love this place on so many levels."}
{"text":"So currently the hubby and I are in the process of buying a house. We had to drive out to North Scottsdale to sign some paperwork and since we were in the area we stopped in at The Skeptical Chymist for dinner and drinks. 

I found the price of food and drinks to be slightly pricey and that would be my only complaint about this place.

The food however is very tasty. I ordered the fish and chips and my husband ordered the mustard crusted tenderloin stuffed with spinach. I got a bit of food envy when I tasted my husbands food. I would recommend ordering that dish.
The fish and chips were decent. You get a big beer battered filet which is nicely seasoned with thick chips.

Being a proud Irish lass I enjoy Irish pubs that actually play great Irish music and Skeptical Chymist does a great job. Sure you hear the cliche, popular bands like U2 and The Cranberries, but they also played The Pogues and some traditional Irish songs. 

The place had a great look and feel to it. They really made it look as close to a traditional Irish pub and I felt really comfortable just hanging out and drinking my Smithwicks.

On this particular evening the place was pretty sparse, not many people, but I'm sure on weekends this place gets hoppin'.

The fact that this place played The Pogues should warrant a five star review, but because I find the prices to be slightly high they only get four stars.
I would definitley go back if I'm in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"This is a really difficult review for me to write. I've eaten here on two previous occasions. I love the decor.  The staff is friendly. The Shepard's Pie is extraordinarily good.

On today's visit I asked why Bangers and Mash is not on the menu.  The waitress said that while it is not on the menu it is available and I could order it.  I did so. Mistake.

I've lived in Britain, home of bangers and mash.  I've eaten many a banger. Bangers are a plump  sausage, typically made with a particular type of breadcrumbs called 'rusk' and they have a very distinctive flavor.  Go to Wikipedia, search for \"bangers and mash\" to see a typical photo.

The bangers on my plate today looked NOTHING like bangers.  Small, scrawny things that tasted rather like frankfurter. they were also a reddish color of frankfurter rather than the rich dark brown that a banger should be.

If you go to Skeptical Chymist I heartily recommend the Shepard's Pie.  Skip the Bangers and Mash however."}
{"text":"Sundays are a good day to do, well, a whole lot of nothing.  After a successful day of avoiding anything useful or constructive, a friend and I decided to stop by for some Irish-style refreshments.  

Located in what seems to be the World's Largest Strip Mall With Confusing Parking Lot, this is a very low-key enjoyable place.  It was not at all crowded on this particular afternoon, and as an added bonus, pints were Sunday bargain-priced at $3!  I tried my first ever Dirty Pear (Guinness on top of Ace Pear Cider) - dangerously good.  I wonder if it can be counted as a serving of fruit...

You can't have an Irish bar without fish & chips, and theirs is pretty good - a large slab of lightly-battered fish which was more than enough for sharing, served with a stack of crisp french fries.  While I prefer thick-cut steak fries, these skinny ones were consumed with no problem whatsoever!  

Thank you, Skeptical Chymist, for assisting me in my quest for non-productivity."}
{"text":"How did I miss the \"owners\" reply...?  I just wanted to mention something-You say that \"Unfortunately repair people are not my employees and when they show up sometimes it is on their schedule\"  I find that hard to believe that they were not your employees as they were answering your company phone at the bar.  LOL enough said!  Yes your \"pub\" was not for me, as it is not a pub to begin with.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"The Skeptical Chymist, aside from having one of my favorite names of all Scottsdale bars, makes a bold claim: to be Scottsdale's ONLY Authentic Irish Restaurant and Pub. 

From a happy hour beer and appetizer there today, it's hard to say whether they made good on that. What I can say, though, is that the chicken tenders were on point and the happy hour special was pretty impressive. 

They are featuring three dollar Harp draughts right now, as well, which is nothing to shake a stick at. 

They showcase quite a bit of live music, and with a big crowd, the layout in here would make for a great time.

A little pricey, as Irish pubs tend to be, but a good find nevertheless."}
{"text":"The few times I have been here have been some of the best times I've had since moving to Phoenix! The atmosphere is 'let us get our drink on!' but not in a fraternity, 'club like', obnoxious way. I love the dark wood and all the different kinds of seating they offer. The outside area is a great place to catch some fresh air or to grab a smoke. 

Happy hour offers super yummy food at great prices! I have also ordered off the regular menu and loved, loved, loved the Skeptical Chymist salad! All the food I have eaten here is awesome!

I've only ever sat at the bar and the service was great! And it's sooooo lovely when the employees remember who you are! Bobby and Jen are awesome and so much fun. You could tell that they made sure everyone at the bar was well taken care of having a great time. They made sure to engage with us and make us laugh, it makes for an experience you want to return to! I HATE going to bars where the bartenders are robots and don't care about the experience you are having and the only conversation you have is taking your order. So. Lame. 

Needless to say I will be returning and look forward to more kick ass times here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar for happy hour in North Scottsdale.  Beats out 4 Peaks by a nose.  High quality bar food is the main draw.  Great service as well.  Easy parking and location near so many jobs is probably why its so popular.

Sundays during football season Seahawk fans gather there which is good for me.

Love to roll in there, order up crab cakes and nurse a couple beers while chatting with coworkers or relaxing while waiting for traffic to die down.

Its an upbeat and happy place!"}
{"text":"Classic Irish pub with some Seattle Seahawks decor.  We have been there a couple of times for happy hour.  Nice decor and good HH prices, particularly the Grimbergen Double Belgian ale.  This beer is outstanding and very hard to find, particulary at $4.50 during happy hour.  My wife also loves the pretzel sticks, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today to celebrate the end of the week.   Lunch turned out to be nothing to celebrate.

My husband got the fish and chips, and the filets weren't cooked long enough; you could still taste the batter, both orders.   Also, even if they had been cooked completely, the fish lacked flavor and seasoning.

I ordered the Belfast Burger.   And it was messy....not good messy....just falling apart from too many toppings.  And the flavor was 'ehh' at best.  Fries were adequate with both meals.

Cost wise, they are overpriced for what you get.   And noise wise....don't even think about sitting outside, where the patio is next to the freeway; inside isn't much better.

Our server/bartender was great....personable and professional.   And the beer was cold and tasty.

This is not a place to order food, but stop by and order a beer on your way to your next meal and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"The BBQ pork sliders were fantastic. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is cozy. Great place to relax with friends and a substantial selection of beer!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile now, and I decided to for lunch today. As soon as I walked it, I felt comfortable since it has that great, Irish pub feel, but more refined. I tried out the tasty Hasher Burger, and it was unbelievable. I can't even describe it, other than a classic burger taste. The sweet potato fries were crispy with some rosemary and sea salt. My boyfriend had fish and chips, and the portions were huge. Big hunks of cod fried to perfection. A great place that I'll be revisiting soon."}
{"text":"Probably the best pub in Scottsdale. Super friendly staff, good food and an awesome beer selection. My only regret is I didn't find this place sooner."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is rated so low is because it is a seahawks bar in Arizona. This place is awesome. Happy Hour is amazing. Service is above average. The food is great. Drink specials are plenty and fairly priced."}
{"text":"I come here more than I care to admit. I've even met a few regulars over the last few months and we're always friendly with each other and chat after work. 

Mostly what's great about Skep is the reasonable drink prices and beer selection - $3.25 beers on happy hour with a lot to choose from! Konig Weiss is a personal preference. The food is also tasty with half-price appetizers from 3-7 daily (I love their crab cakes and jalapeno and bacon flatbread pizza). 

The decor is a nice break from the usual beach bars and overpriced restaurants in north Scottsdale, with wood paneling and old-fashioned medical and chemistry memorabilia (the name, if you're curious, is a nod to \"The Sceptical Chymist: or Chymico-Physical Doubts & Paradoxes,\" written by Irish chemist and theologist Robert Boyle in 1661). Try it!"}
{"text":"large pub...holds 150+ people, great atmosphere. Went there for happy hour at 4PM had about 30 people already there (seemed popular)...and because of the yelp posts."}
{"text":"Probably one of my new fave pubs in North Scottsdale. Fibber McGee's was one of my faves in Chandler, and I just recently found out that Skeptical Chymist is the, 'sister locale'. 

I went on a Thursday night with my buddy, and the bartenders were really cool and easy going and they had a guy singing acoustic on a stage- whom I might add was very good and very good looking haha. But that is besides the point. The decor in the place was great, the bathrooms were clean and the the bar itself was awesome. 
I didn't get to eat there but the bartender made my drink, Black Velvet aka 'Dirty Pear' perfectly! (pear cider topped with Guinness) * I highly suggest you try it!!

Definitely going back soon-"}
{"text":"Come here quite frequently since it is so close to both work and my house. I've never really had anything besides beer and whiskey and both were great. 

The food looks pretty great. I have yet to try it. 

The Irish pub theme is great. 

Last time I went they had a guy performing live music so that was great!"}
{"text":"I attended for the first time during St. Patricks Day weekend. I will give them a pass and may try again because of the crowds but you prepare all year for this day and you know the crowds would be large but come on lets prepare ourselves a little bit better than this. 

The food was good. The service was average and we were shocked when the waitress would not split our check in 2 for 6 people. Very disappointing. But the most disappointing was the quality of our drinks. They were the most water down we have had in the valley. The drinks were what we were looking forward to and the bartenders really dropped the ball."}
{"text":"Went here for so SEAHAWK football last Sunday against the 49ers. So glad I did! This place was completely jam-packed w/Hawk fans - it was so much fun!

Service was impressive and TVs at every angle so that patrons wouldn't miss a single play.

Haven't tried any food but their Mirror Pond draft was tasty. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Charcuterie platter was good, short on the crostini's and when asked for a few more, the cost was more than a whole loaf of bread.  The Chevre goat cheese with mango chutney was delicious.

Fish and chips was good.

Steak sandwich on ciabatta was good. Light on the steak. 

Waitress was nice when she came around."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in town. Go SEAHAWKS"}
{"text":"I have been to this bar 3 times, and the service is ALWAYS different:

1st: Party of 8, work event. Waiter was totally on top of it, knew his beers, knew what he had in stock, and was absolutely amazing. 5 Stars!

2nd: One on One with a co-worker, I had an entire glass of beer spilt down my back, and onto the couch I was sitting on. At least the waitress was nice about it, but jeeze... way to ruin a business suit. 3 Stars!

3rd (yesterday): Came with three friends. I wouldn't recommend to sit at the bar. Waitress has been ignoring us for the better part of an hour, with only about 4 other people sitting there. Didn't get napkins or silverware with food, and we weren't checked up on for nearly 20 minutes to see if our totally empty glasses needed a refill. Check please? 1 Star.

So, to be fair, I'll average it out and give it 3. Better luck next time, I hope!"}
{"text":"Really good food, great friendly service, and a good time every time. They have live music most nights and it's always fantastic!"}
{"text":"Very cool place. Old Irish bars are always the best place to be at, definitely for real beer and whiskey drinkers like real Irishmen. A plus if you're from Seattle or a Seahawks fan, this bar is a Seattle themed bar which happens to be my favorite city. The lighting is dark and they have old apothecary and alchemy props along the establishment. Recommend to any medical history buff or anyone who is looking for a nice Guinness after work."}
{"text":"Cider it's not just for dinner!   

Strongbow on tap, didn't have other types in bottles.

I have a reasonably good choice of Irish bars near my house  so my experiences here are during the lunch hour. There seems to be an almost puritan aversion to drinking  at lunch time in the US which is why I usually end up here at lunch ,with a book and a phone, alone. Sniff. 

This is a stealth bar and while parking is poor if you wish to park really close  the huge lot next to it has always had one available within the first five rows and it's free and it's not 1/2 a mile away. I.E., not atrocious  YMMV

Without knowing what you are looking for it's going to remain as hidden as Brigadoon, ok crossing my Celtic references but the accents in that piece of crap movie  are so bad no  one could really tell).

 Carolyn,my server, has a Scottish accent  so it's not that hard to confuzzle the two without looking affy silly or as glaikit as ma mither used to sae. I think  that's more than anything the point of going to  most Irish bars , the staff, because let's be honest there's a kick ass Thai, Mexican and Italian within easy reach of this place.

Enough crap. How's the grub?  

The curry chips  for some reason appear to be more wedge like a common fault in most of the places that serve this. The curry sauces tastes ok but it's pretty thin and doesn't sit well.  Yet I keep ordering them. 

I've had several of the entrees and haven't been unhappy with any of them other than the Irish breakfast which had  insultingly small pieces of black pudding.  Oops you caught me in a lie there I meant an insultingly small -PIECE- of black pudding. 

In short it's the best place near the Scottsdale airpark I've been in but I'm not driving over from Metro center to eat here outwith of lunch."}
{"text":"Ive been here quite a few times and really enjoy the food and beer. The fish tacos are to die for, especially if you catch them on Happy Hour (only $5 as opposed to $11) and they have a great selection of beer to compliment your meal. The service isn't always the fastest, but it's totally worth it for the food. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food is as expected at a bar. They are definitely trying to swing more gastropub style, and off of that they don't really make my list in the food category. So many great gastropubs in the metro phx area that...yeah...you have to come to play ball.

Now, I love how they are a seahawks bar, the great rotating selection of beers on tap or stocking their fridge and the live music. 

Basically. Would I come here to watch a game or enjoy music..YES. Would i come here JUST for dinner...no."}
{"text":"3.5 - I'm a fan, but it's A-OK.

The first time we ever came here I had a potato soup with blue cheese and bacon. It was fantastic. Since then, the husband has had their fish and chips, corned beef, and the Shepard's pie. All were good, standard Irish pub fare. The best deal they have is their $5 burgers. Every Monday any burger on the menu is just $5 and it comes with one side (fries, mashed potatoes, salad). It's close to our work and you'll know where to find us on Mondays. The wait staff is super nice and even noticed I had dyed my hair (since we are there that often). If you are ever in the area, definitely check it out. The location isn't ideal; it's tucked away in a shopping center off the 101 and next to a Rubio's. You might drive by it once or twice, but don't give up!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place.  The atmosphere is very cool--they certainly embrace the Irish pub feel.  There is a lot to look at and the overall vibe is very down to earth and a place I would love to hang out.  Also, the food we ordered was fantastic and they had a nice selection of beverages.

The service on the other hand... yikes!  I'm willing to try anywhere more than once if it was solely the service that made it a poor experience, but wow this one was a doozy.  We went in for what we thought was happy hour.  We had a group of six, but only three of us were there at the start.  The place was packed.  We saw two smaller tables near each other, and asked an employee near by if she knew of a place that would fit six people or if we could push the tables together.  She told us to push the tables together and walked away. 

Our server acted like we were bothering him from the moment we arrived.  I'm not sure how it happened, but we thought their happy hour went from 4-7p.  It was actually from 3-6p and we arrived about 10 minutes to 6.  We sat down, checked out the drink menu and even specifically asked the server if certain drinks were included in the happy hour.  He confirmed.  It was very obvious that we thought we were there for happy hour.  Totally our mistake, but I cannot believe he didn't have the decency to correct us.  We all ordered drinks and I asked for a water as well.  Drinks came, no water.  We ordered the appetizers that we thought were half off and I tried for my water again.  No dice.

When our food came out, a different waitress brought over our food.  I asked her for a water and she so kindly brought it for me. That was after we asked for it 3 TIMES! My fiance and friends also asked for waters and were never brought them.  They had to ask the server that brought their food as well. This goes for the same with plates and silverware/napkins. It didn't stop there. People at my table sat there at least 15 minutes with an empty glass.  I guess the waiter didn't really do anything awful, he was just generally an unpleasant person.  When it came time for checks, that was a whole other story.  We had mentioned from the start that we planned to split by couples.  Apparently, this was incredibly confusing and our server had no idea what each person ordered.  It was a mess.  The checks had to be re-printed at least 3 times.  And obviously, this was where we realized that we missed happy hour.  We were just told, nope... it's 3-6. ha ha. Okay... thanks!  The funny thing is, we probably would have spent a great deal more money had we known.  We would have purchased off of the dinner menu and not just the appetizers, and I most certainly would have ordered a different drink.  

I was very disappointed with my experience here and I'll be sure to let others know.  I might be willing to try it again some day because the food was definitely good.  We are just new locals looking for a regular happy hour spot... guess this wasn't it."}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere. Decent food. Had the Black Bean burger with Sweet Potato fries. Delicious. Service was acceptable. If you're looking for super attentive attention from servers, you'll be disappointed. If you're not in a hurry, good pub food. 

Not a drinker, but my party was impressed with beer selection. 

Only one TV that I could see in the entire place. I don't think this is the place to watch a game unless it's one group supporting one team."}
{"text":"Awesome place, especially if you are from Seattle/like the Seahawks and a good Irish pub environment. Happy hour is amazing as well."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was attentive and our waitress was very helpful and knowledgable. We had questions about the menus and she had no qualms answering our questions. Husband had the BBQ jalapeño burger, said it had great flavor & perfect level of mild spice. I had the beef Wellington & it was awesome. The fries are fantastic shoestring style & crispy! We'll definitely be back! Our waitress even came back to offer refills after we had already paid the bill & were just visiting - major bonus points for that!"}
{"text":"Good for a Seahawk game in the Scottsdale area for sure!!! Plus, you can bring your dog! Great staff too :P"}
{"text":"Great fun Irish bar.  Always crowded.  Had their Real Lamb shephard's pie with brown bread since I don't eat beef.  I thought it was pretty good but sorry, can't compare it to a real shephard's pie.  But the fact that it's a bar and came out really hot, I'd say that's a good sign.  Good beer.  TV big screens are lacking a bit so wouldn't really come here to watch a game.  Enjoy the ambience.  Love the live music when they have it."}
{"text":"Half-and-half is Half Guinness, Half Harp. The best pint in the world, especially if you don't have the room for one of each. :)

+ Makes a great time kill while waiting for your tires to change at nearby discount tire.
+ awesome party spot for green day.

+ great corned beef and cabbage. served with mashed potatoes and comes in either lunch (smaller) or dinner (heartier) portion sizes
+ beef wellington is *the* original hot pocket. was that tenderloin?!
# sorry, but the wellington's beef was not the freshest
+ big-screen with projector prominently featured for great event viewing
+ excellent alternative to twin peaks across the lot
+ super-friendly staff, always helpful and accommodating

I\"m really glad to renew my review after last time. One of my biggest pet peeves is if you can't cook a fried egg without burning it.
note well: egg was not retested for this review.

# patio seating without noice cancellation phones and individual wireless mics makes conversation impossible against the roar of frontage road, 30 feet away"}
{"text":"Had the spicy chicken last nite. It was spicy and tasty but had NO curry flavor at all. Not sure how that works. Also peppercorn burger had no peppercorns. A little disappointed compared to past experiences. Good selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"Best place to watch a game on sunday, great food, great people, awesome service sundays get really busy but the staff really hustle to make sure your taken care of.  Been coming here for 3 years and i refuse to watch a game anywhere else"}
{"text":"Bloody good pub! Order the cottage pie. The live music is the reason to go. The food, pints and friendly service is the reason to return. :)"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for my first time and have been back since.  The owner is a really nice guy and his staff is equally as kind.  Depending on who is behind the bar determines how quickly you'll be taken care of.  The owner is on his game but some of the others aren't.  
I've had a couple of the craft beers they serve and they have been awesome.  The food is hit or miss though.  On my first visit I ordered a bacon cheeseburger cooked medium.  The burger was cooked well but I couldn't help but noticed how much the patty tasted like sausage.  Because I'm not a fan of sausage, I was \"meh\" about the burger but finished it regardless.  On the flip side, their fries are AMAZING.  Super thin shoestring fries are where it's at!  
On my next visit I had the pork belly sandwich.  The pork belly was so dry it resemled jerky and whatever slaw they put on the top of the sandwhich was so spicy it made the rest of the sandwhich impaletable.  Fortunately I got a side of those delicious fries so not all was lost.  I ate three bites of the sandwich and needed to eat the rest of the fries so that my mouth would stop burning.  
I'll come here to drink in the future as the staff is nice and they have a nice selection of beer but I think I'll skip eating dinner."}
{"text":"We were looking for someplace to watch the Sounders game and figured this was our best bet, but unfortunately, they weren't able to show it. Despite that, we stayed and had a great time. Food was awesome...shepherd's pie A+, corned beef and cabbage A+, chicken curry A+, fish and chips A+ (and, since we are from Seattle, we are seafood critics and this was DELISH). But the best of all had to be the candied bacon on the cheese board. FANTASTIC! We are going to try to replicate at home, and I'm looking forward to the challenge. Great service (our server's 2nd day!) and best of all, best place to see the Seahawks and Huskies!"}
{"text":"Walked in after eating at four peaks. Intended to have several drinks but was told that because I had outside food (leftover pizza in a box) I could not enter the establishment. I then walked over to OHSO and was sat without resistance. OHSO was great.  Pretty lame to be refused service unnecessarily."}
{"text":"Music way way too loud for this more intimate style bar. Good atmosphere but no need to be so loud. Food is so-so. American and Mexican go figure for an irish pub that goes all the way in beer and decor.Ran out of Sierra Nevada, had enough Guinness though! Gave a dirty warm glass eith  Service isn't great tables and dishes dirty. Oh yeah and a MOUNTAIN of dirty glasses on the bar. DISGUSTING!!!!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty cool. The location is a bit weird but I don't think it takes away from it. 

Anyway, I met a buddy here to do some work and grabbed a table and three drop down screens were on with different soccer games. It wasn't too packed at all but there was a lot going on and I liked it. 

The bartender was nice because he didn't want to interfere too much with our work, he even said as much and of course we told him we appreciated it. I ordered the pretzels because I was starving and my buddy hadn't shown up yet. They were pretty good. Not the best pretzels I have ever had but the cheese sauce and mustard were yummy and it was perfect for what I needed before lunch.

For lunch I ordered the Skpetical Salad which was similar to a cobb salad. They poached their chicken which generally I don't like but with their dressing it was really good. The entire salad was big and delicious and I would definitely get it again. My co-worker called and asked that I bring him something so I got him the same salad and he loved it as well.

Buddy had the BBQ burger and was really happy with it as well.

I would definitely go there again just for the salad but it seems like it would be a cool place to chill after work for a couple of beers."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised! We had driven by many, many times wondering what exactly could fit in that little corner of a strip mall. Turns out a lot! A great little Irish Pub with some great food and drink offerings.

My husband loved the corned beef and cabbage, I enjoyed my fish and chips only complaint is that the chips were french fries....fish and chips need chunky fries! It is a tradition. The side of coleslaw though was delicious.

The VERY best part was dessert. Can highly recommend the Bailey's Irish Cream Bread & Butter pudding with custard. Speaks for itself really.

The atmosphere was nice and the staff were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Good food (I had the tomato basil flatbread, but we had a pretty good variety around the table) and good drink selection. The interior is rustic wood and doesn't look like part of a strip mall at all, which is great too. 

The wait staff seemed a little unsure of how to handle the two toddlers we had with us, but they figured it out quickly. They have live music frequently and since it was a slow night, the guy with the guitar played some Christmas songs for the kids and they had a blast. 

The chymist might be skeptical but you don't have to be. It's a pretty neat joint. Drop by if you want some beers and dinner."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at the Skeptical Chemist....

Typical Irish pub with dark hardwood floor, wooden tables/chairs and a very long bar. There is seating outside, on a small concrete patio. There are 2-3 smaller Tv's by the bar, and 2 larger projection tv's aimed at large canvas screen in the seating area. I know there is also live music during the week. 

Food is typical Irish fare. The Sheperd's Pie is served hot, tastes great, but is a little small. I have also had the beef stew which is also very good. 

The service today was poor, but that is the exception rather than the rule.

All in all: very solid."}
{"text":"When you can't be at the game, THE ONLY place in the Valley to watch a Seahawks game! Excellent food and even better service!  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Bobby is such a stud, sweet sexy man, and always greets me with a smile. His hair is always up to par with Paul Mitchell's standards. The craic is always mighty, and sometimes whale world is on the box!!!"}
{"text":"Irish Pubs are one of my favorite things. I met a friend for drinks at a nearby bar a couple of weeks ago. He said he wanted to check the Skeptical Chymist on the way out because a couple of night prior he went to Rubio's and the parking lot was full with people going to the pub. Our visit early Sunday afternoon and it was nearly empty. 

Walking in, I was pleased to see how spacious it is. Lots of room inside plus patio seating. We sat at a high-top table - a large beer barrel with a thick wooden top. I absolutely love the table. It is the perfect height. I learned on my next visit the wood comes from the Washington/Canadian border and is screen printed there. Most of these read Guinness. 

A good selection of beer on tap - and none of it is Bud Light, Miller Lite, Corona. Of course they have Guinness. I started with a Newcastle and later discovered the Firestone Walker Velvet Merlin. Wednesday evenings are another good night. It was busier than Sunday. The special during happy hour is half off appetizers and flatbreads and $2 off all pints. I wanted to try some new things yesterday, although I started off with the Velvet Merlin. I tried the Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA, a Wider Brothers Marionberry hibiscus gose, a Deschutes black butte porte, and a Grimbergen Dubbel all draught pints. Add an order of cod sliders (4) and I got out of there on $22. 
The server was very friendly and stopped by frequently to see how we were doing. She split the check up between the two of us without issue and the orders were accurate. 

I like the feel of this place, the specials, and the large selection of beers. Right now this is my favorite spot, even though it is far from where I live."}
{"text":"I wish I lived a little closer to Skeptical Chemist.  I would eat here more often.  The food is good, the staff are friendly, the ambience is one of a fine irish pub.   All the food I have had has been very good."}
{"text":"First impressions are always the most critical, and my first experience with this place was a bad one.  A group of friends and I came into the place and sat down at a table.  There was about 5 people at the bar and a female bartender.  After waiting 15 minutes with absolutely no one helping us, I came to the realization that the seating area was probably closed but the bartender who looked at us at least 5 times failed to mention that, or even acknowledge that we were there at all. Not even a \"hey guys, the dining area is closed, I can help you up here at the bar.\"  She just watched us sit there twiddling our thumbs.  There wasn't room for all of us at the bar either as we had about 7-8 people in our party.  We were maybe 20ft from the bartender and in crystal clear view to her.  As we got up and left because of not being served, she didn't even say anything as we headed to the door. Absolutely poor service from her!  Maybe one day I'll go back and if they impress me, I will certainly change my rating of this place.  The owner contacted me and apologized, but couldn't you throw me some coupons or half off my order or something to attract me back?  I mean the service was an actual joke, I WANTED to spend money in your establishment but your workers didn't want to take it."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a Friday happy hour with co-workers. The beer was decently priced for happy hour. The appetizers were decently priced, which would be awesome if they were good.

The chicken strips were terrible. I have never eaten something so greasy and yet dry all at once. They are beer battered (like fish) which could be good, but the execution on this was terrible. The outside was really greasy which took away all of the crispy goodness that usually happens when things are battered and deep fried. The chicken itself was dry as a bone. We also got an order of fries that came out cold and were just below mediocre.

The place was really warm, which could be attributed to the summer heat, but we were sitting inside, so there is a fair assumption that air conditioning would be involved.

I'll pass next time my coworkers are planning a trip here. I'd be better off eating at McDonald's."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is loud!!! Almost everyone is drunk. Not a place to go with a group unless your into drinking. The food is gross."}
{"text":"Food Was good.... Service was horrible.

Got into the pub about 6:50pm and was excited to see the happy hour specials... 50% all appetizers 4-7pm. WELL, you had better make sure that your waitress, or in my case the bartender enter in your complete order prior to 7pm or you will not get any discount... I ordered my drink at 6:58 according to the computer and my appetizer order was not for an additional 3 minutes... Yes, that is right 7:01pm and I did not qualify for the happy hour price.

Are you kidding me? it took the bartender 8 minutes to get to me, and there were only 8 people at the bar... 

I honestly do not know if I will go back just on principal.... And this being a Seahawks bar... and I am a Seahawks fan... 

It just goes to show that customer service has really become a thing of the past.

{"text":"The Seahawks win on Sundway was great but Skeptical Chemist REALLY BOMBED!  We called 3-days ahead to reserve a table and called 15 minutes before we arrived to confirm and were told no problem.  We got there at 5p and our table wasn't reserved.  A waitress Kalie(?) said she got too busy and forgot to put the reserved sign out and Kyle a waiter said there was nothing he could do, the owner was out of town and there wasn't a manager we could talk to.  Wow - one of the busiest days and no management on site and staff don't even have the courtesty to offer to help put tables together (which we ended up doing in a side room and ended up spending tons of cash.)  OH - and to boot it was my husbands birthday and he is a raving Seahawks fan.  We were of the same opinion of the Skeptical but no more - they have not clue how to treat their customers!!!"}
{"text":"~3.5

This place is near my office so a few coworkers have invited me out to drinks after work. The inside does not match the strip mall exterior where it is located. Lots of dark woods - very authentic pub deco. The two times I've been there I've had the pear cider, and once split one of their flatbreads, which was okay. Not a crisp crust that I would have liked, but the flavor was good. The service has been good, it doesn't really wow me but it's a nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"First time in we went for late lunch on Friday.  The place was really quiet, only a few other tables occupied.  We tried the fish & chips.  Pretty good but way too greasy for my taste, my partner thought otherwise and devoured.  Also served with cole slaw.  Portion are huge.  Food offerings tend to be heavy and calorie-laden.  But hey, this is an Irish pub and from that perspective, I think they've got it right.

Impressed me as a great place to Go Irish and if you're looking for some night time bar action, could probably work well.  

For me - for lunch - not so much."}
{"text":"Embarrassing TVs. The two sets of Taps at bar have 12\" tap handles that almost completely block viewing the ONE (SMALL) TV behind the bar from almost every seat at the bar. Shameful.

Need more TVs, rearranged taps, better/more friendly service, and cleaner restrooms."}
{"text":"The Chymist is one of the more compelling Irish bars to visit in the Valley. The decor is spot on and unique, with its apothecary goo-gaws everywhere one's eyes land. It's location is challenging, being high congestion area and wedged in a kind of cul de sac of a shopping center. But that doesn't necessarily diminish its appeal. 

Happy hour is the time to visit, with half off all appetizers & flat breads and 2 bucks off all wine and beer. We were served promptly on a Tuesday with the bar maybe one-third capacity. We got a couple of Dirty Apples -- half each Guinness and cider, some know this as a snakebite.

The menu had a lot more seemingly authentic traditional dishes than in other Valley pubs, but a decidedly not-Irish Beef Sliders dish seemed to be one of the most popular orders as I saw tray after tray walk by. I never lived in the British Isles, so I'll just say I was impressed by the variety.

My bowl of PEI Mussels was only five dollars at happy hour. The single-sized tureen had probably 20 or so plump shells in a salty, bacony, and very peppery broth. So peppery, I choked and sneezed through the last half, but couldn't resist spooning out as much of the leeks and bacon that I could get hold of. What is PEI? I found out this means \"Prince Edward Island\", a desirable cultivar. 

We shared a basket of crunchy, thin cut garlic fries, with a cup of leek vegetable stew. Everything was heavily salted and seasoned, which was okay by me.

Great for an after work stop, or maybe check out the live bands or trivia nights if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Great place - too bad it's a Seahawks bar ;-(

Great pints of Guinness - that's what I go here for.  
Pub food is really good.  Genuine Irish breakfast - which is really excellent. 
As an NoSco Irish bar, this place rocks compared to O'Donoghues.  
Friendly staff and excellent service."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as I've been looking for an Irish Bar around Scottsdale that reminds me of Nine Irish on Purdue's campus. A large group of us went here on a weekday for happy hour. I made a reservation the day before but they got the date wrong. Good thing they called to confirm the day of the actual event so I could let them know that we were coming in that night. They had a lot of other large groups and luckily they were able to squeeze us in.

We ordered the garlic fries, wings, pizza, and pork sliders. The food was ok, nothing special. The service was pretty slow too. Since we sat next to the area where extra plates, silverware, etc. were served, we just helped ourselves. The atmosphere was pretty cool though and very much like an Irish pub. They had live music that night but the artist wasn't very good and the music was very loud so it was hard to make conversation with the person sitting right next to you. I'm pretty sure there's no smoking inside but for some reason it smelled like cigarette smoke. I didn't see anyone smoking so I'm not sure where it was coming from as no one at our table smoked.

Overall, it was just a-ok."}
{"text":"First the negative, such a small thing that can spoil a good review. We had dinner at the Chemist Friday. I ordered the corn beef and cabbage. I asked the waiter for mustard and when the bill came found out I was charged for a side of mustard. Since when are basic comments charged, and wouldn't mustard be a standard condiment with corn beef. Too bad Chemist, but your greed spoiled a otherwise good dinner and got you 3 stars. The ketchup was included with fries, is mustard that big of a deal for you?

Otherwise the Chemist is a fun Irish pub. It is always very noisy. They have a good happy hour and if you are a Seahawks fan it is the place to be on game day, Food is good, prices are reasonable. Except for the mustard!

I'm starting a lobby group insisting on free mustard at the Chemist!"}
{"text":"Well, I did it again this past weekend. Drove 30 minutes from downtown to have the Irish Breakfast at Skeptical. It's odd that, living in central Phoenix and being surrounded with Irish pubs and the like, that the best Irish Breakfast in town is up in North Scottsdale.

The black and white pudding are top notch (I always double my order) and the eggs are perfect. Bangers and rashers are great and the grilled tomatoes taste fresh, always.

The Skeptical Chymist is just an all around SOLID establishment and has everything a successful pub needs.
 - Extensive drink and beer selection
 - Friendly, astute waitstaff and bar
 - Plenty of seating
 - Great patio
 - Great live music
 - Plenty of TVs for watching the game
 - AMBIENCE!!!

Don't change a thing... especially the Irish Breakfast. Did I mention that part?

Wish I could eat 2."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and never been disappointed.  Most recently I came with a co-worker for Happy Hour and was over the moon with my food and the price! The flatbread is huge and delicious.  I want to try the sliders next time. Keep in mind HH is 3-6, and I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"This bar has everything you need. They have craft beer (bottles and on tap) and great food. They also play every Seattle Seahawks game. They are also very friendly to cigar smokers on their patio. I have been coming here for years now because the environment is great and they always have new craft beer on tap. Trevor (the owner) has done a amazing job turning this bar into an official Seahawks booster club on game day. If you (a) are a fan of the Seattle Seahawks, (b) like craft beer, (c) enjoy great Irish food and/or (d) like to enjoy a fine cigar on a cooled/heated patio, you have to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great food and good selection of beers.  Horrible service! Sat at the bar...will never do that again...and left pissed! Not busy, two bartenders yet it took them 23 minutes to cash me out.  23 minutes after I received my tab and placed the cash on the bat for them to cash me out. Very attentive while I kept ordering but once I stopped, couldn't get the time of day.  Absolute BS!"}
{"text":"i give this place a 5 star because i like everything about it. it's kind of tricky to find and i had a little bit of a time finding it. everything you can think of drinking they have a wide range of beers and whiskey all kinds of Irish traditionals  such as Shepard's pie they have a lunch and dinner portion and my favorite the butcher's block, as well as good appetizers like wings that you can get cooked different ways and chicken fingers just  to name a few. you will feel at home between the atmosphere and the Celtic music playing on the radio. and if you are a Seattle seahawks fan this is the place for you, they have 55 inch tvs that you can watch all the games every Sunday."}
{"text":"Interesting atmosphere, like an Irish public house. Had the corned beef and cabbage. It was on par with all the other times that I have eaten this dish around the world. I would return again to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I went here on a Monday. Lunchtime. With my husband. Sat at the bar. Ordered two coldies. The mirror pond tasted a bit flat. The Guinness was perfect and of course Good for You! We ordered the pesto shrimp flatbread, shrimp on the side. It was delicious. Then we ordered a flight. From the over 30 beers on tap. Super fun and tasty. They are served in the coolest wooden tray. With a chalkboard piece to remind you what you're tasting. The Union Jack was stellar. Time for grub. My garden burger was unique and tasty. Not the standard frozen patty from Costco. The patty was hearty and the bun was fresh and fluffy. The French fries were amazing, Crispy and fresh. My husband had a burger too, a real one. He loved it. Burgers are only $6 on Mondays. April was our server. She was busy but friendly. The environment was chill, regular joes having a brew and a bite. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check out the Chymist for lunch today.  Parking lot busy - The Chymist empty..... We  seated ourselves as instructed and waited to be noticed.  The bartender/waitress finally came over and had such a bad attitude!  She was very short and snippy with her answers and not very interested in us.  My husband put down his menu and without hesitation said \"let's leave\"     We walked over to Wildflower Bread Company where we were greeted with smiles and wonderful food:).  Stick to the Chymist for happpy hour - where you will get half price apps and a drink for the attitude."}
{"text":"Any place that has happy hour on the weekends gets a high-five in my book. We had the bacon jalapeno flatbread and it was delish. My husband tried several of their beers, and I had the best pear cider ever. 

While it wasn't busy and there wasn't really any good sports on all their big TVs, we enjoyed a Saturday afternoon pit stop there. And their patio looks nice. They seem to have good daily specials, so we'll surely be back."}
{"text":"My favorite Irish pub in the Phoenix valley. Magner's on tap, live music, excellent food and great ambience. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So I love little hole in the wall bars, especially when they're around the corner from my house. This place has a great feel to it, but the food was a bit bland. Now, that could be due to me expecting a certain type of shepards pie, but either way it wasn't that great. The beer selection is great though! I will try again soon to give them another shot."}
{"text":"I had a great time playing trivia with the Yelp crew last night!  

Not so much in the way of vegetarian-friendly cuisine (which is to be expected, since it's an Irish pub) but what I did eat was good!  The curry fries were great.  Big slabs of potato and a large cup of mango curry for dunking.  Gabi also treated us to some sweet strawberry crepes that were wonderful!  I washed it all down with a glass of Strongbow apple cider too.

The trivia itself was fun.  I think it went on a little too long (two hours) but it was a well-rounded selection of questions.  Team \"Go Yelp Yourself\" did pretty well.  Overall, a great night out!"}
{"text":"In 1661, Robert Boyle wrote a book called, \"The Sceptical Chymist: or Chymico-Physical Doubts & Paradoxes\" and it's considered the basis of modern chemistry. 

The basic idea is that matter is comprised of atoms, and every phenomenon is the result of the collisions of particles in motion. It's told through the conversation of 5 friends sitting around discussing the world.

Why do I bring this up and why should you care?

Well, it sort of explains the confusing mess that is The Skeptical Chymist, where they got their name, and why I'm so conflicted about this place. 

First, the good:

1. Excellent food -- I've been there three times and each time, the dishes were excellent. From the Beef Wellington (really? they have that? yeah, they do) to the Reuben, from pulled pork nachos to beer, everything is perfectly cooked and to order. No complaints there whatsoever and it's what will keep me coming back.

2. Atmosphere -- It's a welcoming and friendly place, with worn wooden furniture and appropriate lighting, with enough room between tables that you don't feel claustrophobic.

3. Beer selection -- Since I'm more of a vodka guy, this doesn't mean much to me, but to my friends, it was quite impressive. Quick note -- Did you know you can spend $24 on a bottle of beer? I didn't. 

The Bad:

1. Slow service -- I realize there's an art to getting everything to the table, simultaneously and at the right temperature, but come ON. I really expect the kitchen and the wait staff to be on point during lunch. Maybe they were short staffed every time I went, but it's always slow.

2. Keep my drink filled -- It's a basic concept, and if I have to ask more than once, there's something wrong. We're in Arizona, where it's a million degrees out -- I need fluids.

3. If you advertise \"Gluten Free\", your food damn well better be gluten free. I get it, it's cool and trendy to say you have a gluten free menu and as long as you're dealing with bored and pretentious people who are leaping on the latest fad, there's no harm. That said, for the people who actually HAVE Celiac Disease or a severe gluten intolerance, you need to tell the waiter. TSK has a few options for people who are celiac, and the rest that say \"Gluten Free\" should come with the disclaimer, \"Wait, you're serious? Oh, LOL, nevermind.\"

4. Small portions -- This really depends on what you get. The corned beef plate was three or four little pieces of corned beef, and if I'd been the one who ordered it, I would have sent it back. The Beef Wellington, on the other hand, should fill even the emptiest of stomachs.

So, to wrap this up, if you're looking for a place to bring four of your friends and discuss chemistry, it's a great choice, because you'll have plenty of time to talk while you wait for your food, plenty of good beer to keep you entertained, and plenty of gluten to send your celiac friends into a coma."}
{"text":"I run a really nice restaurant, and the experience I had here was really uplifting. I came for a rare after work beer, and was treated to the best service, from a bartender, that I've had in a while. Barry is great. I'd love to steal that guy. I'll be back"}
{"text":"This place is good  They have a great selection of beer and wines.   I will be bringing my mom back to try the crab cakes for sure as she is a fan and they were pretty darn tasty. 

Make sure to try the garlic fries too - they are fresh cut and tasty."}
{"text":"Typically, \"bar food\" gets old and is pretty plain. Skep Chym keeps it fresh and varies their offerings regularly.  Been going for years, my only complaint is that they have a preponderance of \"hoppy beers\", which are too bitter for my palette - but that's not any reason to give them anything less that 5 stars.  Food costs are slightly high, but I love the Irish centric atmosphere and food!"}
{"text":"Fun and lively atmosphere, corned beef and cabbage a great choice, friendly and prompt service..."}
{"text":"Great place, very cool atmosphere. Went for lunch with my wife, server was very friendly and knoledgeable about our drinks, my wife got an Arizona Mule and Shepherds pie, the drink was awesome 3specially because the server was willing to play with the recipient a bit since my wife preferences rum to vodka, the pie was astounding!"}
{"text":"I failed to see what was so special about this place - but I've only been there for lunch. Given how many of my friends frequently mention this place, I imagine part of the draw is the crowd at night.

During the day, this place sucks. I also wasn't impressed with the food or the service. In fact, my food was pretty awful and wrong except for one item which was okay. I'm irish if that means anything... nothing about this place seemed to say \"Irish Pub\" to me. I wasn't even aware that's what this place was until I read the other reviews here. That could just be me being oblivious to my surroundings though. 

I'll probably give it another chance at some point - at night... it's just in such a shitty location. I'm not too anxious to drive that far and then drink and be stuck out there."}
{"text":"Seahawks bar in AZ!!! Awesome!! Ok the beer specials during the games was a great deal with $3 anything beers, pretty cute waitstaff ( I wish I remembered my waitresses name but she was very sweet and looked like she was 16 but very nice and quick with drinks especially since we had like 20 people in my group, I love places where waitresses can keep up with a ton of tabs and not complain)
Overall very good, I only had scalloped potatoes since I was not feeling well but everyone said the food was good. The TV setup was strong and great views and audio. 
I don't give out a lot of 5 stars but when I come next time I will try the food for sure and keep up the great service."}
{"text":"The food is just okay.. but hey, its bar food. The environment is really good. Staff was friendly and attentive. They really invited in the decor. Very much like a pub in the UK."}
{"text":"AMAZING & FUN atmosphere.
Not only do they serve one of my favorite beers(Strongbow) but the food is truly delicious.
We originally stopped in for some live music, and found that not only did we love the music, the decor, the drinks and the food but the people are also fantastic! 

Love this place -everyone should definitely try the curry, oh and the fish and chips with malt vinegar. 
Dont forget to stop in on a day they have live music!"}
{"text":"The pretzels were decent, although the fries were really oily. This place is decent for drinks and has an interesting decor, but it didn't meet the expectations I had going in."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, decent food, live music that was awesome, plenty of beer. Add in great friends and we had an awesome night. 
The pub fries were flavorful and the burgers are great. Good service, very friendly. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love coming here and sitting in the patio. There is an opening to the bar where you can order drinks and I like this much more as opposed to waiting for a server to bring you drinks and check in on you. 

To be honest I have only tried their wings and fries here and I was very satisfied. 

Drinks are decently priced, making it a good place for a quick bite with a drink."}
{"text":"When this place first open I was thrilled--great food, fun atmosphere and great live music. Something has changed and it's not for the better. Went there today for lunch and the crowd was not what it used to be. I ordered my fave fish and chips and they were not good at all. The batter was not completely cooked and the cole slaw was old. I paid $11 for fries, as they were the only decent thing on the plate.

Sad when a food fave goes bad. Not sure if they changed owners or if they just gave up. The items on the shelves are all dusty and knocked over and now looks more like the haunted house at Disneyland! Geez."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for football, especially if you're a Seahawks fan! Good food and drinks too! My only qualm is that it's a UW Huskies bar...GO COUGS!"}
{"text":"Monday... BIG screen football, volume up, don't come here Mon night if you don't want to be immersed in football. $5 burgers that are reg $10, combined that with happy hour deals 4-7 pm every day of delicious GOOD drafts for just a bit over $3 & all flatbreads & apps 1/2 price. At normal prices I would feel more 3-star. But if you know what you are getting into & come for deals, it is great for what it is.

Waiter was VERY knowledgeable of menu, helpful with suggestions.  

Atmosphere really is great with the dark wood ceilings to floors, big place but broken up with all sorts of nooks, interesting apothecary stuff Apollo over in cabinets, with Seattle Seahawks stuff thrown in."}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance of this place from the moment I stepped out of the car and was walking in looking at the windows.  They did a great job with decoration.  The beer was great and with half price pint night I was in heaven.  The daily specials on booze are all good, making me wish I lived closer and could be a regular here.  I will be back next time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here tonight for our first time.  I've been to Ireland and was looking to experience some Irish atmosphere and food.  We arrived early enough that it was still happy hour so since my wife wasn't too hungry, she took advantage of the half-price appetizers.  She had the lamb skewers with salad and enjoyed it.  We also shared an order of the garlic fries, which we thought tasted good but wish the potato fries were a little bigger.  I ordered the Shepherds Pie which was good, although a bit bland.

We arrive at an overall rating of 3 stars as follows:

Atmosphere:  4 stars.  It would be 5 stars but the Seattle Seahawks stuff on the walls really do detract from an Irish atmosphere and makes the place feel a little like a typical American sports bar.

Food:  4 stars.  Nothing special and I would give it 3 stars but I bump it up to 4 stars because the menu is unique with items that aren't available at many other restaurants.

Service:  1 star.  The service was the worst I've experienced anywhere.  The waitress was practically non-existent and never came back to our table to refill my iced tea, see how we're doing or see if we want to order anything else.  I filled my own iced tea by spying an iced tea pitcher across the room and walking over and filling it myself.  Even when she brought the bill, it took her what seemed like forever to return to run the credit card.

This was our first time to eat here and we likely won't return.  There was just nothing in the experience that urges us to return."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere that was neither too bright nor too dark. Prompt sevice. Come for the happy hour appetizer specials. Tasty mussels in a very nice broth for only $5!"}
{"text":"This is a fun Irish bar with good food. Seahawks and Husky fans rejoice! This may be the only Seattle based bar in town. Yummy French fries with awesome aioli. Bathrooms are clean and nice. Only went during happy hour so not sure what it's like at night!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.

I was the only customer in the place at 11:30am! (good for quick grub at lunchtime in North Scottsdale)

Lunch was good, I had the chicken club - the service was brisk and friendly (shocker), fair prices, and the décor is excellent - has a genuine Irish Pub feel to it.

I will try to make it back in the evening when the place is a little more lively.

*****UPDATE*****

Returned here for drinks on a Friday night - nice crowd, live music, and great beers... definitely like this place better at night."}
{"text":"This place was OK. I walked in on a Thursday night and it was just about empty.  The idea of it sounds better than the actual place.

The outside decor looks kind of neat with all the bottles.

Seated ourselves and eventually the bartender/acting waiter came over to take our orders. 

They have a happy hour which is nice but it was for bottom shelf liquor... I want to spend money on a decent drink, not  a below-average drink that is usually already cheap to begin with.  ATTENTION PATRONS: $4 Drink is now $3 Drink! 

I ordered the chicken tenders with what I think was their house Ranch. My boyfriend ordered fries and something else...

I didn't like any of the two entrees nor the appetizer from this place. 
(Tasted stale and over breaded) 

Definitely Skip this place if you are hungry and want some good food."}
{"text":"Come in often for a couple pints and to watch soccer.  Staff is friendly.  Rasher burger is good, as are fries and wings.  Heard good things about the muscles as well.

Very accommodating owner and manager."}
{"text":"I have to say I loved this place. We went in on a Friday night for the all you can eat fish.  Ordered beer first. They have a great selection of beers and the waiter/manager?? not sure at the time, was very knowledgeable about the brews. The fish was super good. I loved the batter. The fries are fresh cut and the slaw ( well not everyone can do a great slaw) so it was ok for my tastes. A few words of advice, try and sit in the main room and not the room to the right as it was a bit warm. Not a lot of ventilation and no fans. Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best Irish pub in town. Just don't order the Pok Pok wings. Seriously what is that? it must be the chef's adaptation of real Pok Pok wings, to each their own, but this was not my favorite. Some of the recipes seem to have changed over the years but my standbys are still the rasher Burger and the steak salad and the Beef Wellington. The flatbreads are good to share as well as the curry fries which come in regular and sweet potato options. I prefer the older bread pudding recipe but the new recipe is okay. The Guinness is fresh. All you can eat fish and chips on Fridays and specials on every other day of the week. With chefs pairing on Thursdays"}
{"text":"Pretty average dive bar. Good for games and HH. The Flatbreads and beer specials are worth the visit. ***3 Stars."}
{"text":"I had high expectations going to a Seahawks bar for a Monday Night Football. And it met my expectations. The flatbreads were very good, I had the Tomato Basil and my wife had the Bacon Jalapeno. As a vegetarian I usually find it difficult to find decent bar food. But they did have an above average black bean burger that could be substituted on any burger. 
In addition if you are a Seahawks fan it's the best place to watch the game in the valley."}
{"text":"I really don't know how this place does not have a 5star rating. The staff has been fantastic every time, the beef Wellington... yes I said beef Wellington! Is FANTASTIC! I make it a point to try something new every time we come, this time it was the pork sliders, also fantastic! If it was not a 30 minutes drive to get here we would come far more often!!

Go here point to something on the menus and, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Appetizers were great and at Happy Hour prices, hard to beat! Drinks are cheap too! Josh was good at getting our group of 15 seated together! The only reason they did not get 5 stars as the waitress seemed a little scattered.... Asking for napkins or extra lemons for the water seemed a stress to her......    I always wonder if the gratituity being included on lard"}
{"text":"Can I give this place \"0\" Stars??!! 

This is the 2nd time I have come here and also the 2nd time I sat at the patio. The first time was not a great experience mainly because the outside server was terrible. She never came around and it made for awkward moments when she did. I decided to give it another try and what did I get?! Another terrible experience. 

I came here on this past Thursday night around 830PM. I wish I knew who our server was because I really wanted to complain. My friend and I sat down outside at a table and then a moment later another group sat down after us. Their table received drinks and appetizers before we even got asked what we wanted to order. We honestly waited about 10-15 minutes before I decided to hunt for a server inside and ask where the patio server was.  I let that person know we have been waiting for about 10-15 minutes and  haven't been approached for anything. This server was happy to go out of her way and at least get our drinks. She was friendly and was hoping she would be our server and not the normal outside patio server. Well, unfortunately the regular outside patio server  ended up being our server for the night. We then tried being optimistic about it and went and ordered both our drinks and food because who knew when she would come around to check in. Well, later the night came and another 15 minutes or so go by without our server coming around to ask if we wanted anything. I ended up going to the bar outside and was about to order when FINALLY the server came and asked if she could help. Whelp, another awkward moment between the server and us. 

Later that night, she came around once more and said she was closing out and if she could close our table. We said \"Yes\". Let's just say that her overall service deserved a at most $1 tip just because I felt bad, but did give her a 10% tip because I'm not that mean. 

Overall, the food, was OK, the drinks were OK (little watered down on mixed drinks) and the customer service AGAIN was horrible. I am not giving this place another try because 2 times is enough and with the same experience.. They really need to fire most of their servers and get servers that actually know how to treat people and provide at the least \"Decent\" customer service. NEVER AGAIN!  Oh, and the bands music is so loud that you couldn't even have a normal conversation without yelling. Tone the loud music down so that I can actually have a choice of sitting inside at a table than outside at the patio where all the smokers sit.."}

{"text":"Hidden Gem I think - Really cool décor for pub/restaurant.  Some Irish food and beverages (amongst others).  Food has been pretty good each time I've eaten here - it's the overall atmosphere being unique that moves this to a 4 for me.  Service is good.  Cool bar.  It's a Seattle supporting establishment - so Seahawks should enjoy.  They have daily specials on food - so check that."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because it is a Seahawks bar, other that that, it sucked!

My husband and I went there last night (a Saturday) with a group of friends and there was only one waitress to be seen and it is a fairly good sized bar. Now, one would think that a Seahawks bar, playing a Seahawks game on a Saturday night might have a few more waitresses, but no. 

First, it took forever to get the first round of drinks and then forever to get any other drinks. My drink (a raspberry vokda and soda) tasted extremely odd and I'm not quite sure how you can mess up a drink with two ingredients, but it didn't taste right. I gave up and did't order another drink.

Next, my husband had the lamb skewers and according to him, they were disgusting (I am a veggie, so I didn't eat them), but they looked awful! They were fatty lamb (I hope) sausages on a stick. Gross!

Finally, I did request more water, after drinking all of mine within a few minutes of arriving, and not receiving a refill. The waitress ended up pouring water into the remaining contents of my nasty drink and not into my actual water glass. I couldn't even get her attention to get a fresh glass of water. 

After years of serving, I actually felt bad for my waitress and didn't complain; however, I don't think i will be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Well the owner e mailed me and stated he looked for my credit card for 10 minutes, what else did he want me to do. UNACCEPTABLE response. 
Looking for a credit card for 10 minutes is hardly an effort. My friend who is a VP of an national restaurant corporation could not believe these were his actions. Oh well.. 

Positive aspect: nice atmosphere and good beer."}
{"text":"Went last night for the Seahawks draft party and Sounders FC game.  There was a pretty good turnout.  

I ordered just an appetizer and some Blue Moon's as I was going to eat dinner later.  I got the southwest corn bruschetta and it was pretty good.  The bread was nicely toasted and the corn and black bean topping was really nice.  

I can't wait for the football season to start to head back again."}
{"text":"This place is a fun Irish bar with a pretty cool name. It was pretty packed when I was there for happy hour. The appetizers I tried were pretty good, but nothing tasted out of this world. I really like the Pear Cider though. They really have a great selection of unique and Irish brews and the atmosphere really feels like an Irish Pub. It seems a bit out of place in Scottsdale, but I enjoyed being at a bar with a different theme other than the party scene of Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Seahawks central in the middle of Scottsdale Arizona ... pretty cool atmosphere... makes me feel like in WA watching the home team"}
{"text":"Fun bar. Good food and service. The on tap beer selection is great. I like the fish and chips and the irish breakfast. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, multiple great food choices, and a true Irish pub atmosphere which has been hard to find here in Scottsdale.  Good music on weekends, trivia night during the week, definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Not to busy during the day, great lunch specials.  And at night if your into a good ol fashioned Irish bar this might be the place for you.  Good draft and whiskey selection, very friendly service staff.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, don't ever eat Irish food to be honest. I was more than satisfied with my choices. I had the mussels on HH and the sea scallops. My friend had the fresh baked pretzels which were simply amazing. I'm not sure if anything we had was truly Irish, but whatever it was it was delicious. I would def. come here again."}
{"text":"Cute little Irish pub tucked away in a what seems like a never-ending strip mall.

I've stopped in here twice for lunch after meeting with clients and both times the place has been pretty empty, but I'd definitely be down to check it out for happy hour or on a weekend to see what it's like.

The service was good, though a little slow -- not to the point where it was deemed worthy to complain, but just enough to keep checking the watch to see how much time was left before I had to move on with my day.

Several beers on draft (though not my thing, my coworkers seemed to like that), the flat bread pizza-type plates seemed to be a hit and my steak salad hit the spot."}
{"text":"Best Irish bar/pub in north scottsdale or Scottsdale for that matter! Great happy hour specials, yummy food- chicken fingers! Awesome live music on the weekends starting around 9!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place - decent HH. Smirnoff Shakers for $3 and good portion appetizers for 1/2 off. I got the cod sliders and this was a good amount of food! The fish was really tasty, not some bland piece of frozen fish sticks! I'd totally go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible, stopped in last night probably about 10 people in the bar, around 11pm on a Saturday while on a date, bartender saw us walk in and totally ignored us.  We stood at the bar, bartender just looked at us.   So we left, with that kind of attitude now wonder this huge bat was empty!!!!  Will NOT recommend will NOT be back.."}
{"text":"This was a decent place. I really liked the atmosphere, the server was really cool and on point. Cool Irish pub. The burger I had could've been a bit better. Wasn't bad, but wasn't all that great. Would definitely come again to try some fish and chips. Cool place."}
{"text":"Official Seahawks bar of Arizona.  Great staff, good food, and Seahawks fans! Would be nice if they got some HD flatscreen TVs instead of the square projection TVs they have."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that The Skeptical Chymist is a hop, skip, and a jump away for me and my honey because we love this place. Derek, Barry, and the owner are amazing. They are goofy, and always remember what drinks we like and, unlike most, our names.
Besides the fun, loving service, the beer selection is always top notch and their mac n cheese is to die for!"}
{"text":"I have had numerous menu items and every one of them was great.  Corn beef and cabbage was excellent, sliders were great, fries were great, chicken tenders were great, and I can on from there.  Most of the servers are very nice, attentive and polite.  They have always been very accommodating to me and my companions.  It is a bar, but it is also a great place to come eat with the family.  I have never been disappointed there."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to drive the 19 miles from home to Skeptical Chymist to see our good friend perform on a Thursday night. We have been here a few times before and love the atmosphere, food and beer selections.

We arrived at exactly 7:00pm and I had to use the men's room so my wife found a table. After the few minutes it took me to clean up and found her standing at the table she wanted covered in the mess from the previous guests. There were several other empty tables in the restaurant but my wife like this vantage point of the stage. I sat down and waited a while as we watched servers making their rounds and one even walked by and gave us a courteous smile but kept on walking. We agreed that he must not be our server. I walked up to the bar to read the beer selection chalkboard and returned to the table. Still no server. It is now nearly 7:10. My wife flagged down a mid to late 20 year old male with a tightly pulled back, short pony tail.  My wife asked if he knew who our server was. He just replied with \"Why did you need something?\" My wife said, \"Yes, we need our table cleaned and want to place our order.\" He proceeded to walk away without a response. We sat for another entire song of Jay's set and my wife finally decided to go to the bar to order us a round. As she was approaching the bar, the server came to the table and asked if she was going to the bathroom as he watched her standing at the bar. I told him she was ordering our drinks. He said, \"Nice\" and finished wiping down the table. Yes, he was only wiping down the table 15 minutes after we arrived and was upset because we decided to get our own drinks at the bar.

We had nearly finished our first drinks and he had not returned to the table with a menu or to see how things were. I finally had to go find a table that had a menu on it. We made our choices and still waited. It is now nearly 7:30 and he is wiping down a table near us so I got up and confronted him in a heated tone as I told him how unacceptable his service has been. I tried to turn it on us that we went to the bar and it was \"confusing\" to him. He was obviously being facetious and I called him on it. He asked me what I wanted him to do. I told him to tell one of the other servers to come take our order.

He came by our table a few minutes later and made no attempt to recover the situation and only continued to tell us how \"confusing\" it is when a customer goes to the bar to get their drink rather than wait for him. I was so angry that I told my wife I wanted to leave. This was disappointing because we had come to see Jay play and enjoy dinner.

We went outside and calmed down. Rather than go find another place to eat and miss out on Jay's performance we decided to go back in and find a seat at the bar. We ended up staying until 9:00 and happily gave our dinner and drinks tip to the bartender.

I really don't think this young man has any business being in the service industry. Unfortunately, I believe he has been at Skeptical Chymist for quite a while so I would have to put this behavior back on management."}
{"text":"A great little Irish beer with fabulous pub food and awesome drinks!! Quite an extensive selection of whiskeys and import beers alone! I`m usually not a big beer drinker but I did try a dirty black and tan ( half Guinness and half Irish cider), hello delicious!! 
I have been here three times so far to indulge with my friends, group trivia, and its always a great time!! Superb and friendly staff! Plus the gal who reads out the trivia questions has quite a thick Irish brogue, quite enjoyable! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Very chill place. Great place to grab a bite and cold beer. The menu has a lot of different fare from the typical bar food. Live music on Saturday night makes it even better."}
{"text":"I do love this place... good grub, great atmosphere - and they have a Seattle Seahawk's following!  This is a place I use to go to with co-workers where we could use the wifi and work late afternoons while enjoying a Harp.  Now, that my job has changed, we go for Seahawk games or anytime we're in the area.  Always delivers a good pour."}
{"text":"My favorite North Scottsdale drinkin' place.  You can't beat $3 Harps.

I'm a huge fan of the food too!  I love the standard stuff like the Fish and chips and the Beef Stew, but the Salmon Entree is fantastic!  

Make sure that if it's an option on any meal that you order that you get the Scalloped Potatoes.  They're extra yummy.

Very nice, relaxed casual atmosphere.  Lots of seating space.  Huge projected screen for watching sports.  A few cute waitresses.  Yummy beer.

Overall a great place to hang out and have a few drinks or dinner.  And like other people have mentioned it's an older crowd (meaning generally over 30) which is perfect for me.  :D"}
{"text":"Great local pub serving great craft beers that are always rotating. Has a great happy hour 3 to 6 everyday $1.75 off draft beers and half price appetizers and flatbreads. Also has live music and is a Seahawks bar."}
{"text":"Still love love love this place!!!! Great bartenders with their cool Irish accents and exceptional service. This place is so chill and just a great place to be to grab a nice cold beer while listening to a live band or watching a game. We come here about 2-3x a week...yea  I sound like an alcoholic... but can't help but come back for the good grub & beer. If you haven't tried this place, seriously ...go grab yourself a drink with a side of chicken tenders...you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere and love the bartenders (Jody is awesome!) and their drink menu is great. Their happy hour is good too. But cmon they raised the price on their Monday burger special from $5 to $6? And that's only with a purchase of a drink! Since when was this changed?! Also $2 for a split plate!? Sorry if I buy my burger I should have the option to share it with whoever I want. Not pleased with how stingy they've become with their \"special\" menu."}
{"text":"Parking is atrocious.  Hard to find the first time, which is a royal pain every time you try to get friends to meet you there.  Off and on I've had a dishwasher soap like residue flavor issue with their glassware, especially when they first opened.  I know it's Scottsdale, but prices were still a little on the high side compared to nearby beer places such as Four Peaks and Oggis.  Very trendy, yuppie crowd and not an old school Irish pub at all."}
{"text":"So...our first visit here hit it out of the park. We loved the atmosphere walking in to the place. It felt like Dublin, sort of. On top of that, we had amazing service while sitting at the bar, the bartender was knowledgeable of the beer selections, the food was AWESOME. They had a fairly diverse selection of different beer styles, which was great. We had the meat sampler platter (not the right name, but you get the idea) and it was yummy, especially the black pudding and the wee tiny nibbles of lamb. I can practically live on brussel sprouts and these were some of the best. Cooked perfectly, a bit charred, and super flavorful.  I completely believe all the reviews that say the staff is great must have had this bartender! She was fun, kept our glasses full, handled a busy bar. The real deal.

So, very excited to bring a couple out of town friends here, I had bragged about the great food and service. This second experience was nothing like the first. The bartender was too busy flirting with a chain-smoking dude at the end of the bar to pay any attention to the four of us, so we went to a table, to clear our eyes from the wafting smoke and the scene in general. The server brought us everything we asked for, but had no personality and was letting a bad day affect her job. Ugh... The beer selection tilted heavily toward IPAs and high IBU's and I was not thrilled like the first time, but still had a pint of something. The pub fries we ordered were completely inedible. Super limp and soggy and not the sauce we ordered. How do you make shoestring fries soggy?!? They sat for about 15 minutes before our server finally showed up. She just said \"sorry\" and took the full plate away. Did not offer to order something else or anything. In the meantime, a couple of us had ordered burgers, and they were just OK. The flatbread was overcooked and somewhat tasteless. We were charged for the disgusting fries. I was a little embarrassed, frankly, for bragging this place up. We definitely did not find Irish charm in this visit. No manager was visible anywhere, or I would have spoken with them. 

Because I am not a Seahawks fan, and because the \"Irish feel\" was not there for me, I didn't want to give it another chance. But, because I LOVE Ireland, and it's charms, I knew I had to give it one more shot. I just went again last week. It definitely seemed like they had almost all IPAs and super hoppy beers again, which made NO SENSE for an Irish Pub!! That was the beginning of the end. The same rotten bartender from the time before was there. I mentioned the lack of diversity in the beer selection and she said, \"So, get something in a bottle.\" No more to say about that. I was NOT ready to give up! I wanted to love this bar. So, I ordered the brussel sprouts to try and make up for the underzealous burgers from the last trip and the disappointing beer selection. Guess what...new cook or something. These brussel sprouts were soggy. I think they may have been leftovers from the local elementary school lunch cafeteria! YUCK. 

So, probably won't go back. I just can't recommend going here for any authentic Irish pub feel, except the decor, and I've spent a lot of time in Ireland and Northern Ireland. I'm definitely skeptical..."}
{"text":"Great bar! Love the decor and the selection. Great staff, very fast and friendly. The bartender is almost too attentive. I would definitely recommend this place to all my friends. I'll be back soon and often!"}
{"text":"How nice to be instantly transported from a run of the mill shopping area into an old school Irish pub. The Syeptical Chymist has a decent array of beers and whiskeys but they do not carry Kilkenny (my favorite).

Pros:
Great happy hour specials. The appetizers are really very tasty. My favorites are the beef sliders, garlic fries (I know not very Irish huh?), and mussels. The Shepperd's Pie is served traditionally with lamb mince rather than the other local pubs who use ground beef. Also, the Irish breakfast is the best in town. Additionally, the staff is EXTREMELY friendly and helpful.

Cons:
The owners must be from Washington state because there is Seahawk and Cougar paraphernalia everywhere. Isn't there a bar in town that plays Charger games?? At any rate, it gets loud during game time, but no big...It's an Irish pub right?

Definitely recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It is my favorite place to meet up with friends for a fun casual night out. The food is yummy, staff is very friendly and the live music on the weekends is amazing!  Always a good time!"}
{"text":"I visited The Skeptical Chymist by happy chance yesterday.  I happened to be in the area for a meeting and I had to find somewhere to eat quickly.  I arrived at 11 a.m. and saw they had a fish n chips special for $14 AYCE.  Of course, I am not really one to eat a big lunch, so I ended up ordering the $10 lunch portion of fish n chips instead.

I really liked their chips, which were really skinny, heavily salted fries.  This was not a meal for those on a diet.  There was also a huge, unsalted (as far as I could tell) piece of fried cod and some coleslaw on the plate.  The food was decent and there was way too much of it.  If you have a big appetite, why not try it?

I was on my way to a school function, so I could not partake.  I did have a Coca Cola, which the waitress kept well-refilled.

I was happy with my lunch and the service.  The place was dead at 11:30ish, only having a couple people in the place.  I know it was early, but being so near the holidays I expected more people there.  Hopefully they picked up later in the day.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Skeptical Chymist has become one of the favorite spots for me and my circle of friends. Their selection of beer and other drinks is pretty solid, and the prices are fair. I've only ordered food once, and it was decent and reasonably priced.

I usually come on Friday or Saturday nights. They often have live music and only a small to moderate size crowd, which is great for providing atmosphere without the waits and the cluster. They have couches and a dartboard over in the corner which is what we usually do when we are there.

The decoration and theme is great. Dim lighting with a relaxing vibe. I've never been on a Sunday during football season, but apparently its a fun crowd and judging by the decor, if you're a Seahawks fan, a great place to watch the game in company of fellow fans."}
{"text":"I love this place. Delicious fish and chips, shepard's pie just like I had in Ireland and fantastic Guinness which is poured properly. I love this place do much I tat my bridal shower was held here. They were so fantastic about it and all my friends love the experience. They were so great about handling our large group."}
{"text":"Fish and chips and Stella Artois all the way!  The staff is pretty much all Irish which is different and fun.  I'm guilty of always ordering the same thing when I come here, but it's always good!  This is a great place to unwind after work or go for happy hour.  There is plenty of parking, you just may need to walk a little bit... heaven forbid!  They project soccer games on a huge screen inside, so if soccer is your bag, you'll really like this place!  This will be an awesome place to spend world cup!

The decor is tasteful and not over the top at all... I don't know what that Greg guy is talking about!"}
{"text":"Cod sliders aren't bad. But this review is for my waitress. Wish I remember her name but may be a good thing I don't. 
first thing she asked was what I would like the drink I swore I said jack and coke. 4 times she kept saying diet coke. and 4 times I kept saying jack and coke. Waitress walks away and comes back 2 seconds later and asked if my drink was diet coke. I told her no, it's coke. And what does she bring me? a coke. where's my jack? 
Top it off, she annoying waitress kept asking me very 5 minutes if there was something else she could get me. After I say no for the thousand time, she gives me my bill when I haven't even asked for it. Gee'z pushy much to get my out the door?"}
