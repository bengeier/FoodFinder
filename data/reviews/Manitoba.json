{"text":"A poor experience: the food was mostly a success (with one notable exception), but the service was the worst I've ever had in Montreal.  I feel it's important to identify the particular waiter who was so odious. I don't know his name, but he was very tall, had a shaved head, a beard, and wore a bow tie. His colleagues were fine, but he was simply atrocious.  We went for dinner on a Friday night with a group of 3. I had reserved by phone three weeks ahead of time, but when we got to the restaurant they had obviously lost our reservation. The aforementioned waiter didn't apologize, and instead condescendingly informed us that, \"you will wait 20 or 25 minutes, you'll have a drink, and that's all.\" He then ignored us, not even coming back to take our drink orders. Thankfully a waitress noticed that we were just waiting around and saved us by taking care of us for the night. She seated us right away and got us started on dinner.  The food was interesting and mostly well-executed. We had elk carpaccio, jerusalem artichokes, and whelks to start (all good, though the \"wine syrup\" overpowered the carpaccio), and venison steak, seafood pot-au-feu, and cabbage pierogies for mains (mostly good, but shockingly some of the pierogi dough was raw!). I felt like some of the assemblages were a bit haphazard; some dishes felt like a random mix of ingredients without much thought put into how they should be combined. Portions were normal.  The horrible waiter visited us at one point in the dinner to put his hands on the backs of two of our female dinner companions(!) and asked us, bizarrely, \"Are you happy?\" We were shocked. Thankfully, he never came back.  We didn't stick around for dessert or coffee as the poor service had soured us on the restaurant. The music wasn't too loud, which is a nice change from most places in Montreal.  I won't ever be going back or recommending this place to friends. It's a shame, because the kitchen shows some potential. However, the management desperately needs to gets its act together with regards to customer service. A quick look at other reviews shows that lots of people have had problems with terrible waiters."}
{"text":"Two stars only because the wine was great, though we waited an incredible 35 minutes for it to arrive at our table and it was the first thing that did arrive, but not the first to take a long time. The server seemed nice, though ill informed and overburdened with customers.  The owner was flitting about, not being overhelpful and scantily dressed. Is it wrong to have something like a uniform in a restaurant these days or at least dress like you have some kind of pride in what you do? To pay 125$ for a bottle of wine and ROOM TEMP oysters, cool fried cat tails, sad sad sad greens, a few pieces of duck breast and some unidentifiable deep fried stuff( best thing we ate) is a bit scandalous I think. It took an astounding 40 minutes after our ordering for the food to arrive in the sad state it did, the temperature suggested perhaps it was ready and waiting 10 minutes before. The general vibe is one of confusion and frankly I cannot imagine ever going back, shameful as I found the concept intriguing and inspiring."}
{"text":"The food and cocktails here are unique, and the open atmosphere is great. Every dish was plated beautifully. The servers and host were very friendly and attentive. I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Voilà un resto qui risque de fermer très vite. En prenant un plat au nom intéressant, on se demande ce qu'il y a dedans quand on le reçoit : le cerf. Mais de cerf ce n'était qu'un peu de poudre avec trois petits morceaux d'Asperge , deux morceaux de patate bleue. Décevant. Trop cher. 13$."}
{"text":"I cannot review the food because I left before even ordering.  We came here on a Saturday afternoon and the place was empty with the exception of a group of 4 people or so. All the waiters/waitresses were just hanging out and totally ignored our presence. Then I came up to one of them and said I would like to be seated. He seemed really surprised like \"seated? on a restaurant? whats going on? wat is my life?\" I am not sure if he was high or hangover from the nigh before. We sat down and waited for 15 minutes for the waiter to come, which he never did, so we just got up and left, and not surprisingly none of the waiters even noticed. It was totally surreal."}
{"text":"I am surprised this restaurant is rated only three stars. I went to cap off a day of exploring Montreal with my husband, and had a truly wonderful meal. We were seated in the best spot in the house, at the bar overlooking the kitchen. We were able to watch the food being prepared and chat with the chef, who was quite friendly and sent over one of his dishes to try (cauliflower soup).  We ordered his fresh pasta with beets and dandelion greens (maybe the best thing we ate), the arctic char gravlax, and the bone marrow. Everything was SO GOOD. And I have never gotten an order of marrow bones that included FOUR bones. The tart berries were a nice pairing and this is my new favorite preparation. Waiter was also super nice and friendly, cool ambiance that would have fit right in back in New York City, and couldn't have asked for anything better (other than to be more hungry so as to try more things).  Best part? With drinks and tip, the total came out to like, 80 USD. Total bargain. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was terrible, explaining the bad experience to the owner was a waste of time. There are many other restaurants in Montreal with good food and good service so I won't be going back here and I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Wow, I mean wow for every single dish. I frequent enough Michelin stars and this was perhaps one of the best meals thus far this year. Perfect balance of flavor, temperature and presentation. We were a hungry group of 10 and every single person left satisfied and complimented me on be restaurant pick!"}
{"text":"One major warning for the winter months.Do not sit at the two tables near the door.If they can't move you leave.I spent $ 150.00 on a very good meal and wine with really good service.But my overall memory was being cold and uncomfortable.They offer you fur or a blanket, but its enough."}
{"text":"So excited to visit this place but we were incredibly disappointed. The service was rude, the food poor and unsophisticated. Overall an incredibly disappointing expierience. Staff acted like we didn't get it- so sad that they didn't get how bad the food is. Ignorance is bliss."}
{"text":"Last night I brought my sister to Manitoba for her birthday dinner. Immediately, we were greeted by a kind waiter who offered us the option of sitting at the bar overlooking the kitchen or at a table. After explaining it was my sisters birthday he recommended the bar as a fun experience. Despite being a Wednesday night the restaurant was busy and the chef came over to us right away to explain that there were groups of food bloggers coming by the restaurant for about 1/2 hour. He apologized and assured us that it wouldn't take over the whole evening. Despite the crowd the fantastic service continued. The waiter serving drinks was able to offer recommendations and gave us a bit of history on the drink we had selected (\"Gin & Jam\" was a delicious cocktail). As we looked through the menu the chef came over to us again and offered to create our menu for us. He assured us that he wouldn't \"blow the budget\" which was kind and asked us about any thing that really interested us or allergies. Being pretty adventurous eaters we gave him carte blanch and were thrilled with the result!  We tested a variety of appetizers from the menu. First, a comforting cup of cauliflower and corn soup which hit the spot followed by oysters that were incredibly fresh and delicious. We were then served an unbelievable pasta dish with smoked sturgeon and brussel sprouts. Followed by the Lamb terrine and duck hearts. The duck hearts is not something that I would typically order, however the dish was so delectable and we were happy that it made the cut. The lamb terrine was flavorful and had a fantastic texture, leaving evidence of the lamb rather than the often pureed texture found in a terrine. As our main the chef served us the venison steak with a potato rosti, and the most tasty carrots I have ever had. The steak was perfectly cooked and extremely flavorful without being overly gamey. We ended our meal with both the chocolate terrine and the sunflower cake. Both offering such amazing taste and texture combinations.  This restaurant offered more than just incredible food. The service was impeccable and the whole staff made us feel welcome and like they were cooking for us at their home. The chefs displayed an obvious passion and understanding for the food that they were sharing with their customers. With each dish came a simple explanation, which made you appreciate the food that much more. Throughout the evening we had watched the chef making the pasta and meticulously peeling the brussel sprouts and the result was well worth the tedious job. Each dish was prepared with attention to detail and in watching how much time and effort went into each preparation, there is no doubt that your meal is worth every penny. You will leave this restaurant with a overwhelming desire to return and try the rest of the menu items, but also a sense that you want to return to a place that offered a welcoming and relaxed dining experience.  I would whole heartedly recommend this restaurant and can't wait to return again soon. With a seasonal and local menu I can't wait to see what will be offered for the winter selection."}
{"text":"I walked in and thought \"I'm in for a great night\". The space is wonderful. Turns out, I was disappointed. I had some great biodynamic wine and service was good, but the food was a downer. I wasn't expecting super huge portions or anything super fancy but I left this place 75$ poorer and almost starving. Parnsip \"risotto\" tasted like...half-boiled parnsip. Marrow bones we burnt, marrow was almost non-existant. Bleh. Would rather eat at home and then go have a drink at Manitoba. Homemade bloody cesar was worth it."}
{"text":"A local foodie recommended this place and the media write ups were quite eloquent, which is frankly deserved.  Blackboard menu isn't trying to do everything, just a few things right instead. Decor is rustic industrial with a good outdoor courtyard that makes it very airy, seating at the bar overlooking kitchen is a great spot.  We sat in the front under the birchwood which had a completely different feel, cool either way. Service all night was impeccable, attentive without being overbearing and suggestions were spot on. Six of us shared most of the menu which was generally.well presented and prepared.  The Lobster, marinated trout, bison carpaccio and asparagus stood out.  The bison steak and rabbit liver deserve to be mentioned as well.  yes, it's a carnivorous menu. Had the Sicilian Nero red as the last review.  Three hours later,  reasonable check in hand, we started planning our summer visit to see the seasonal menu changes, kind of answers the \"would you go back\" question."}
{"text":"Whhhaatt?!? It's impossible to give 0 star!!?? This restaurant is so bad, I've created a Yelp account just to review it! Cold badly cook super salty food, warm wine, over priced and the staff just don't give a f@ck. Do yourself a BIG favour, avoid it. Look around, there's thousands of great restaurants in Montreal, don't get fool by some Williamsburg wannabe's."}
{"text":"Great food, very original but without being gimmicky. Every dish was exquisite. And very good service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We where invited to celebrate a birthday. The place is quiet cosy. Nothing very fancy a simple decor and a weird black outfit for our waitress.  You open the menu , and you do not have more than 5-6 choices of starters  and main dishes each.  It is a place where you will try new things. If you're not an adventures person that is willing to try new dishes,  just go to a regular commercial baton rouge.  They have a wide range of red and white wine. I took an amazing drink, the Margarita d'Elisabeth. There is coffee in it. It was so delicious. I ordered two of them.   For starters, I had the mozzarella buffala with grilled corn, it was oki. The rest of the table wanted to try their seal tataki with grilled and buttery seaweed. The taste is really light. Very weird plate!  As main dish all the invitees took the deer. I had the pig. The meat of the deer was really tasty and also very tender.  The pig was fried and full of fat ( let us say it is the good and healthy fat) but it melts in your mouth. It is a very good dish. It comes with a grilled zucchini. Finally we shared the dessert.  I definitely recommend this place specially if you are completely bored with the culinary scene in montreal and whant to try something new.  The good thing is that they change menu very often."}
{"text":"Came to Manitoba for a quick lunch before a meeting. I loved the interior of the restaurant. It has an incredible modern vibe while maintaining a cozy atmosphere. I had a sausage on a bun with a side of sprout salad. The flavours were amazing and the meat was so rich. It was well seaoned and everything felt very fresh. The restaurant kitchen is also open concept meaning you can literally call over the bar to the chefs. Great place for a meal if you are in the area.   Lunch will run around $20-$30 so if you are on a budget, try for lunch rather than dinner service.   Tip: they have a forrest tea that is crazy good. It smells like pine needles and tastes like a glorious hike."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5. Service was good, and ambience was super cute. Probably top 5 ambience in the city (especially during the summer with their outdoor seating and garden lights ) and cocktail game is on point! I was very impressed!  The food is good (but not fantastic), but it's expensive and portions are small. With these two drawbacks I have to give it a 3.5. However, they do offer an exotic menu (we tried the seal and the boar).   I think everyone should go one time to experience the ambience and the unique food offerings but know that you aren't getting a steal."}
{"text":"I found Manitoba by chance, and wow was I happy about it. The vibe is very chill, but confident, these people know that their food is delicious, and they want you to relax, have some drink and enjoy the environment. I tried their roasted duck, and it was the most tender and delicious duck I've ever had. The smokey taste blew me away as I mixed the sauce and duck itself with the vegetables and potatoes on the side. I had a chance to meet the owner as well, and she is very friendly! Her idea of using local products and local farms to create a wonderful Montreal experience is honourable, and in my opinion they are doing an excellent job at showcasing the delicious variety that the Quebec area has to offer!"}
{"text":"You know that see saw motion you make with your hand when something is kinda \"so-so\"? That's Manitoba in a nutshell. We showed up on a cold night (-24C) and were greeted by someone to take our coats and get us seated. Not the normal hipster treatment - nice! The table was great, we had a nice banquette and a view of the room and kitchen, so far so good. Waitress was pleasant, service was prompt, cocktail was decent.   Unfortunately as soon as the food arrived things started to slide downhill. I had the duck hearts and my wife had the raw scallop. The hearts were well cooked and meaty but the whole dish including the lacklustre sauce was lukewarm. Nothing grosser than bloody and cold red meat in a gloopy under warmed sauce. The scallop dish was a joke. If there was half a single scallop in the entire dish I'd be surprised. It was mostly just cheap rice crackers with invisibly small scallop bites on each. Not a great start.   The mains weren't much better. I had the venison steak my wife had the pork belly. She was asked when she ordered \"have you ever had pork belly because there is a lot of fat\". We've all had pork belly and I can assure you this was the most inedible piece I've ever seen. The crackling was so hard you couldn't cut through it, the fat layer was nearly 2 inches thick and pretty much everyone I saw eating it was just discarding most of it. The meat under was ok but it having to butcher and waste your own meal is never gratifying. The whelk and Brussels sprout accompaniment was so vinegary I had a coughing fit when I first tried it. Is anyone there even trying the food before it goes out? The steak was well cooked and tasty but again lukewarm. The potatoes on the side were scalding hot though. Again just the sign of a really undisciplined kitchen.   And this is really my biggest complaint. The kitchen is wide open and some of the stuff you see there does not inspire confidence. The guy shucking oysters kept looking at his thumb as if he cut it, the kid doing most of the cooking looked greasy and dirty and kept playing with his hair. One dude had a ponytail down his ass and it kept flying over the food as he spun back and forth at the pass. I only saw anyone there wash their hands once. Gross.   When we left the kitchen was doing shots with the waitstaff and there were still 4 tables with people at them. Pretty weird. Glad they're having fun, and the vibe is kind of cool (great 80s playlist and clear everyone enjoys their job which is nice to see), but the food is really middle of the road at this point. There may be greatness in this restaurant if it can pull itself together - taste a dish, check the temperature, and save the kidding around for when customers have left. And for gods sake stop opening the back door in the middle of winter!"}
{"text":"Manitoba is a hidden gem in the neighbourhood. From the outside, you wouldn't suspect there is a restaurant there, however as soon as you step in there, you can see a beautiful decor. If you go there in the Summer, you'll be able to view their amazing terrace.   The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the food they serve.   We had 4 meals portions: the leek, the seal tataki, the suckling pig and the deer. Every meal was tasty and well prepared. My least favorite one was the leek, I thought it was too heavy on the sauce/cream.  It is difficult to select a favorite one, because the others meals we had were all so amazing, but if I had to choose only one, I would pick the tataki seal. This is something I had never tasted before and it melt in my mouth as soon as I tasted it.  The vegetables are biologic and freshly picked the day prior. About 90% of all the ingredients are from Quebec province.   We finished with a desert, which was oat, rhubarb and sweet clover. It was good.   As drinks, we had some the gin and jam and the virgin jam. There were good.  We were lucky enough to be sitting in the best seats in the house, which were by the chefs and next to the terrace as well. Therefore, we got to enjoy the nice view of the terrace, the breeze and got to see all the hard work that went into the meals preparation.   It is a restaurant that we would definitely recommend and we'll come back for sure . Overall, the food came quickly, the staff is very nice and knowledgeable, the decor is great, the food is amazing."}
{"text":"J'avais vraiment envie de l'aimer ce resto là. Habitant st-Zotique et passant devant tous les jours pendant les travaux, j'étais vraiment excitée à l'idée de découvrir ces plats aux inspirations sauvages. Quelques semaines après l'ouverture on se décide à le tester en gang. Très belle déco, menu vraiment alléchant et bière maison, une rousse, très goûteuse.  Ça part plutôt bien. Les plats arrivent, on debuzze instantanément. Personne ne dit rien, mais l'éléphant est dans la pièce: les portions sont ridiculement petites. Quand je dis petites, je ne veux même pas parler d'une portion tapas, mais plus petite qu'un pintxo. Un rire nerveux puis on goûte. Très bon, rien à dire la dessus. Mais comment se faire une vraie idée des saveurs avec un mini cur de cerf coupé en fine tranche, deux huîtres rachitiques et 3 haricots qui se battent en duel? Que dire du feuilleté aux champignons qui n'est en fait qu'un feuilleté à rien (les trois champignons sont a côté) On pourrait commander d'autres plats mais c'est la où le bas blesse, les plats oscillent entre 13 et 18$. ( La où chez pintxo justement, les prix vont de 4 à12$) La facture monte donc très vite, mais le sentiment de faim, lui, est toujours bien présent (même avec une facture de 100$ pour 2) Le Manitoba fait bien des manières dans un quartier qui n'en fait pas. Bref, une expérience désagréable et l'impression de s'être fait avoir sur toute la ligne.   Pour une bonne bouffe allez plutôt chez le gai luron Mile-ex ou encore pic-niquer à la dînette triple crown!"}
{"text":"The place isn't easy to find. Super discreet building in a residential neighborhood. When you go inside, though, it's cool and cozy, with a very welcoming atmosphere. We had dinner there during Mtl à Table week and I was very impressed with the quality of the menu. The seal tataki was simply extraordinary and all the other dishes were delicious, carefully prepared. Service was also very nice. Great place, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food with a very different taste... I passed on the duck heart and the seal, but had a great broccoli (veg plate) with pesto and goat cheese. Desserts were also great!"}
{"text":"Absolument dégueulasse et extrêmement cher. Ne s'improvise pas chef qui veut. L'assiette de lièvre était une farce monumentale.  Un morceau de rable minuscule dans une bouillie de légumes immonde et fade. Un peu marre de ces restos qui n'ont le look. Bien pour briller en société."}
{"text":"Came to Montreal for Joe Beef, instead ate at Manitoba the first night- Joe Beef the second.  The place is very cool yet not too cool...the waitstaff were perfect - knowledgeable, involved - spoke english as well as french and my french is limited to croissant and foie gras......and were able to answer questions about the food that were not typical.  fresh oysters, smoked bone marrow with cherry tomatoes and herbs, a nice salad - simple yet enough, venison done rare with fiddleheads, and a spectacular char with mushrooms, bacon and magic. A nice red wine that complemented both the venison and the fish. We ended with both desserts and 4 spoons- 1 each. I have to say that it is - if not equal, at least in the same league as Joe Beef for those dishes. Lastly, had a few of their interesting cocktails - not a few for me - our group. The gin with elderberry jam and the \"margarita (their take on it) were both really tasty, small but tasty. Enjoy."}
{"text":"My friend and I ended up at Manitoba after watching a show that featured it as part of MTL à TABLE, Montreal's restaurant week. Walking into the restaurant, which is at the end of street filled with factories (some still functioning, some converted into condos and restaurants), the first thing you notice is how contemporary it looks, especially with its open kitchen. Then you notice that it's not just contemporary, but has a contemporary explorer theme complete with animal pelts draped here and there and logs lining the ceiling. The décor mirrors the food to a tee: hearty staples like pork chop, fried sturgeon, and squash are served with a gourmet twist.   We barely got reservations on a Tuesday night at 9pm (remember: restaurant week), and were seated at the only free table. The hip-hop music playing when we got there quickly changed to James Brown, though I have to say the hip-hop seemed like a better fit. The lighting was dim and romantic and there were small candles glowing on our table. We got 3 choices for both the appetizer (\"Peckish Menu\") and entrée (\"Hungry Like the Wolf\") and 2 choices for desert (\"Sweet!\"). I chose the fried cod collars, the grilled pork chop, and the butternut squash panna cotta. Our waiter was very nice and recommended a bottle of white wine, but when we tasted it, it didn't seem appropriate for such heavy food, so we asked for a red and took the La Chambere D'Edouard.   Out came my fried cod collars which were reminiscent of standard North American Friday Night Fish Fry fare. It had ample (read: AMPLE) mayonnaise-based sauce spread beneath the very fried, but still tasty, fish. Whatever I envisioned the sturgeon vinaigrette tasting like, it wasn't mayonnaise, and I could have done without it -- and with a lighter breading on the fish. My dining mate's dear heart gravlax was much lighter and tastier.   Next was the good-sized grilled pork chop, and by good-sized I mean something that, 300 years ago, would have fed a team of explorers and their guides for a week. Covered in black elderberries and on a bed of beans and wild rice, my first thought was \"tough, but delicious.\" But then, even with my friend helping me, it required so much sawing and chewing that slowly I began to regret the fact that it was so big. 22 hours later, my body is still yelling at me to become a vegetarian. Moderation makes the heart grow fonder.   Last was the butternut squash panna cotta, which was served with delicious crouton-like chunks of toffee afloat on its creamy depths.  Though it had some exotic sounding ingredients like seabuckthorn and apple and balsam fir, they didn't stand out to me. The cool panna cotta was quite refreshing after such a heavy meal, though after the pork chop I barely had room for it. The \"northern rock,\" which my friend ordered, looked like a puff pastry served on a bed of moss and, though not mouthwateringly amazing, was good and fit the foraging/traditional Canadian/ explorer theme.   By the time we were done with our meal, our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us, and I had to try and make eye contact about 12 different times with multiple members of the wait staff to get the check.   My overall impression of Manitoba? Hearty portions that could easily be shared between 2 people, high-quality ingredients that could stand to be stepped up to reflect the prices, friendly staff, and nice atmosphere. Judging by the young, attractive crowd dining around us (which could be a reflection of restaurant week), Manitoba is going to be a yupster staple in this section of downtown."}
{"text":"I'll be candid: I came here to mange the flesh of wild animals the flesh of which I had not previously manged. So I was pretty disappointed when venison (that's carnivore lingo for deer flesh) was not available. Luckily, the baby seal was. I'm not actually sure if the seal was a baby or not, but I kind of hope that it was. Anyway, it was the highlight of the menu for me. We also ordered the Nordic shrimp in day lily juice (a little odd, but good, nothing too exceptional); smoked mussels (excellent); beef with malt cream, mushrooms and potatoes (pretty fantastic); beef scoter (solid); and arctic char (good). If I could redo anything, I would have tried the sucking pig instead of the Nordic shrimp.   Apart from the high-quality, wild cuisine, the atmosphere and service were the perfect balance of classy and comfy without pretension. My only complaint is serving size. For the price, I think 10% larger portions would have been nice."}
{"text":"L'ambiance et l'espace est charmant et je leur accorde. Côté bouffe, j'avoue avoir été déçue. Je m'attendais à des plats beaucoup plus gouteux. J'ai cette impression que c'est Over rated. Les plats sont assez cher pour ce qui est servi. Petit détail qui serait important à améliorer: un système de ventilation pour éviter de sentir la friture et la viande pendant des jours. La terrasse extérieure semble vraiment belle mais nous y sommes allé l'hiver donc nous n'avons pas pu en profiter. À lire le site web, on m'a vendu du rêve sur les aliments et épices locales utilisées mais, ils ne nous ont pas été présenté lorsque nous avons reçu nos plats donc même si il y en avait dans nos assiettes nous avons rien vu passer... La service de la serveuse était super. Le mec serveur était un peu trop invasif dans notre date d'amoureux. J'avoue avoir préférer le service de la dame."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon expérience au Manitoba, mon entrer de saumon cru étais délicieuse et que dire du plat principal le steak de cerf wow . Exellent service et très belle ambiance. Je le recommande fortement"}
{"text":"This is a 5-star restaurant experience, so I'm very confused by the current low rating. We're major food enthusiasts and discriminating Yelpers, and this was perhaps the best meal of our trip up and down Quebec.  It's a little out of the way, but you'll find it's a gem if you venture to it. A few minutes' walk from Little Italy/Marché Jean-Talon, you'll find this little indie enclave full of awesome food and wine options. I started off my meal with a glass of the \"orange wine,\" which was pricey ($18 CAN$), but how can you pass up orange wine? One of the strangest wines I've ever had, but it set the pace for a unique dinner I'll remember for a long time.  In the light of the setting sun (in good weather, they open up the garage door to a back patio--there's also dining in front of the restaurant that's quiet and lovely), we feasted. The meal began with deer heart and heirloom tomatoes, and both were fantastic. Our mains were the maple-ized beef bone marrow and the (apparently special) duck breast. The duck was VERY good duck, but the marrow was pretty darn-near as good as it gets: so sweet and acidic and salty all at the same time! To top it all off, we had a blue honeysuckle berry/pine (!!) panna cotta!   The meal was so unique, and the service was so great, any tour of Montreal's extensive food scene would be incomplete without a meal at Manitoba. Furthermore, the restaurant serves its own beer, which is pretty flippin' good, as well. The total bill for the meal was just over $100 (CAN$), about $75 USD. It was an amazing value at that price, and we ate to our hearts' content.  You might be able to tell I'm excited by the memory of our meal there. I hope that you'll visit and feel the same."}
{"text":"Upon recommendation of a colleague I had the most delectable dinner last night at Restaurant Manitoba. Most of the items on the menu are GF or can be modified.   We started off with the salmon and seal appetizers and had the deer and suckling pig Entrée. These were absolutely amazing, fresh, most flavorful dishes made with regional ingredients.  The service was incredible, the atmosphere was great, the only downside is that it even though we were late September it was extremely hot outside and no AC in the restaurant. Would definitely go back preferably on their awesome looking terrace or on a cooler day."}
{"text":"Nice discovery with this restaurant. The decor is very trendy, in the industrial sense of the term. I don't always like this as it can really be a hit or miss but in this case I believe it suited the concept pretty well. I was a bit weary coming in, as we didn't have any reservation and I read previous reviews about the staff so was pleasantly surprised to be welcomed warmly and treated well throuhgout the evening. We tried the mackerel and the deer. Both were good. Fresh produces and amazing use of local and traditional food and spices. The airmail cocktail was very nice too, with their own rooftop honey which was a lovely plus. We finished with the prune custard pie, which my partner loved though I found it just meh! Yes, the food is quite overpriced - I suppose you also pay for the concept and the originality - but at this price, I believe the chef could show a lot more generosity in the food he serves. We paid 100$ for two and left still hungry which is never good coming out of a restaurant! (Thank dog, I always have macarons waiting at home for just this sort of emergency!)"}
{"text":"Went last night for MTL à Table and had a good time. My gf and I ended eating the wrong starter which we did not mind, but we had a good laugh about it with the people next to us (who was supposed to get it). The main meal was really good and cooked well, but I cannot say the same about the salmon (but I do not know if it was supposed to be like that or not). I did try one of their drinks, but I didn't find it sweet enough and I tasted more of the bourbon. Anyway I had a lovely time and I will try it out another time and who knows it may become a 4-star review."}
{"text":"Belle découverte. L'ambiance est agréable (autant le décor que la musique), le service est hors-pair et le concept de nourriture sauvage est bien tourné. J'ai choisi en entrée le gravlax de saumon, les pommes de terre au foin et le tataki de bison. En play principal, la courge était bonne quoi que le plat aurait pu être plus relevé... bon choix de bière et de vin!"}
{"text":"La cuisine est simplement délicieuse, avec toujours une touche d'originalité car ici on cuisine \"sauvage\". Les cuissons étaient vraiment parfaites, et j'ai mangé du riz sauvage avec un sirop au thé du Labrador pour la première fois, quel délice.  Avant ma première visite, on m'avait parlé de portions minuscules, alors j'avais un peu peur mais il s'est avéré que pas du tout (ou alors mes amis sont des ogres???), elles sont même parfaites pour le prix. Pour 2 personnes, 2 entrées, 2 plats et un dessert partagé, cela nous avait couté 80$, pour de belles portions et une si belle qualité, je trouve cela très raisonnable! L'ambiance et le service étaient aussi superbes, on s'est même fait offrir un verre de vin !  J'y suis retournée pour avoir un deuxième avis (on sait jamais hein!), je suis sortie un peu de mes habitudes en choisissant de la joue de boeuf (je crois, j'ai une mauvaise mémoire), et c'était divin!  Je songe à y retourner bientôt!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband stumbled upon this restaurant on a food tour while we were visiting Montreal. I came here for my birthday and was seated where the chefs were cooking the food. I was in awe of everything that I saw. The food was honestly the best we've ever had. We had the seal with smoked butter which was amazing. That was my first time having seal. We had beets with poultry liver sauce. I hate liver. But that sauce was pure magic. It didn't taste irony or livery at all. For my main dish I had the pork shank. It tastes more like a lightly smoked ham with crispy skin. Ugh it was so amazing! My husband had the duck. It was so tender and flavorful. The chefs obviously have a great deal of mastery and respect with and for the ingredients that they use. They brought me out a dessert that was to die for. Can't wait to return. What a brilliant place and it's owned by strong and kind woman. That was icing on the cake for me. Meeting her was wonderful."}
{"text":"Le concept est vraiment très très cool, des produits locaux, souvent sauvages et presque toujours intéressants. Je suis absolument en amour avec la déco, et l'ambiance est vraiment bien.  J'ai partagé une entrée de wapiti cru avec mon compagnon, qui était absolument délicieuse. Des lichens fritsm shiitakes marinés, et de la bette à carde parsemaient les généreuses bouchées de wapiti. C'était excellent.  Comme plat principal, j'ai pris l'os à moelle à l'érable (goût à peine présent, mais c'était tout de même très bon), accompagné de baies de sureau, de radis noirs et des mêmes bettes à carde présents dans l'entrée. Dommage. Je suis très contente de mon plat, mis à part qu'il y avait peut-être un peu trop d'os à moelle et pas assez de légumes. C'était gras, gras, gras, j'en ai eu mal au coeur toute la nuit.   Mon compagnon a pris le flanc de cochon qui gagnait la palme en matière de lourdeur (mais dont le goût était quand même assez bon), accompagné de spaetzles (une sorte de minis pâtes) et de rapinis. Bon goût, mais il en était écoeuré assez rapidement.  Le vin était bon, et la carte était très intéressante, avec plusieurs options de vins nature.  Là où ça s'est corsé, c'est lorsque notre serveur, jusque-là très sympathique et aidant, s'est mis à nous ignorer lorsque groupe est arrivé à côté. Heureusement qu'il y avait d'autres serveurs qui passaient régulièrement pour nous débarrasser et remplir nos verres d'eau. Mais le serveur principal n'est jamais venu nous demander comment on avait mangé, si on allait prendre un dessert ou un café (ce qu'on aurait fait). Il est simplement venu tout bêtement nous porter la facture sur la table, après 25 minutes d'attente. Sans même dire merci ou au revoir! J'ai trouvé ça largement moyen... C'est un big no-no quand le service est pas bon!  Je recommanderais quand même ce resto à cause de la carte intéressante et des découvertes que l'on peut y faire, mais je me garde une mini réserve."}
{"text":"Rarely have I been so impressed. Hidden away off a side street in Mile Ex, Manitoba mixes a beautiful setting with incredible food at a reasonable price. All the dishes are inspired by, and use, elements of Quebec nature, giving each dish a unique quality. From local seaweed, crisped and added with raw seal, to perfectly cooked deer with a medley of local mushrooms, the food, ambience and setting was genuinely exquisite. In a city of culinary gems, I could not recommend Manitoba highly enough."}
{"text":"Le Manitoba m'a été recommandé par une copine.. et mon dou qu'elle connait bien mes goûts. Les produits sont frais, locaux et leur menu m'a impressionné par son originalité!  Nous étions assises au bar, face à la cuisine et avons eu la chance d'être \"entertainé\" par le gentil chef Cédric, qui nous a bien impressionné par ses talents culinaires, c'est vraiment un art son affaire!  Avec mon amie, nous avons partagé l'entré de mozarella de bufflone... OH MY!!! que c'était bon. Un tas de nouvelles découvertes.. de saveurs, de textures, de bonheur!!  Comme plat principal, j'ai mangé le cerf. Bien que je ne sois pas une habituée des viandes sauvages, j'ai trouvé le goût très intéressant, quoique très prononcé, avec une cuisson parfaite. Digne d'un grand chef quoi!!!  .. Ah et je me suis gâtée avec un \"à côté\" de bacon... Mais pas nimporte quel bacon, LE bacon, fait sur place par le chef Cédric... Y'a pas de mot pour décrire ce que j'ai vécu ;)  Le serveur a su nous expliquer le menu, quelque peu complexe, pour bien éclairer nos choix, autant pour la bouffe que pour le vin.  Si seulement il y avait avait 6 étoiles à donner!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here this weekend, I feel like they have sorted out some service stuff that was bumpy in the beginning. We were warmly welcomed, they found the one possible remaining table for us despite no reservation, explained the interesting things on the menu without making a big condescending show of their 'concept' which I've experienced at a couple places recently and seems unnecessary. I love restaurants that support local farms and heritage produce but over-archingly I think a restaurant's job is to make people who are choosing to spend their precious little time and money with you feel kindly warmly welcomed.  Anyway, most importantly the food was delicious and totally interesting. The brook trout was so soft and savoury and great, and the vegetable dish I ordered with foraged mushrooms was creamy and incredibly tastey. I could eat this every day, especially followed by the panna cotta dessert which I would like for breakfast lunch and dinner please.   Beautiful room, friendly easy going smart staff, delicious food. Main dishes are about $20 to $28 which seemed expensive to my Toronto friends, and inexpensive to my Ottawa friends, and fairly normal to me. Love this room, can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"There are many places in Montreal you can have a great meal. Fewer are the places you can have a truly interesting meal. Skip the white tablecloth bullshit - if you want a taste of Canada's national character, head straight for Manitoba."}
{"text":"You would never know it was a restaurant . I was giving the address and would have not have found it without the address no sign .What a nice place located at the end of Rue Saint-Zotique O right off Parc Ave. They have have a small  bar in the front with an open kitchen concept and sitting for about 40 people . They have a patio in the back which would be great in the summertime. They were cooking/smoking something on the BBQ  which smelled wonderful . The staff was very friendly and went out of there way to speak English to us . They told us that everything is fresh. The vegetables are organic. They have a small menu on the wall. The prices are very reasonable. Well I had the Arctic char fish which was amazing . It was cooked perfectly with red roasted potatoes. The salad was very fresh and light. The Manitoba Restaurant is where the locals eat and this was a sure hit. We will be back"}
{"text":"When you are in a new town, you want to explore the best the town has to offer. I claim this was one of the better restaurants that were available within a reasonable budget.  The day we choose to go here was the day they started their new menu. The main focus on the menu, is game. Which I'm a big fan of and it's hard to find a good place in North America on the East Coast.  I started off with duck hearts, which is always a risky decision. But they not only won me over after the first bite, they won everybody at the table over. The perfect balance between sweet, savory and salty. Structurewise everything was amazing. Tender hearts but with a nutty finish  To keep the game going (get it?) i went for the wild heir. I remembered this in Belgium being filets but here they were served on the bone which came out to be a bit of a challenge so i digged it as chicken. It was good but less tender than i expected it to be. Again everything on the plate was well balanced and the compmimentary glasses of wine made the meal complete.  If there's something that bothered me and which is also the reason for the 4-star instead of perfect, is the service was very slow. It took us almost 2,5 hours to finish our dinner with a long wait to order and in between dishes. In the end, the wait was worth it but i wouldn't have mind to gotten away a bit faster."}
{"text":"Je n'étais pas allée depuis quelques années.  Ils ont tout rénové! On y retrouve la même ambiance industrielle décontractée.  Nous avions beaucoup aimé la première fois et n'avons pas été déçu cette fois non plus.  Nous avons commandé les entrées de crevettes et celle aux poireaux. Comme plats, l'omble et le boeuf. C'était délicieux!  Service efficace et sympathique.  Jolie terrasse.  Un bon restaurant dans le mile-ex. Assez bruyant, comme tous les restaurants trendy."}
{"text":"Excellent venison and lobster. Great wine pairing. Deserts were meh. But overall a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, just re-opened. We had a good time, the wine was on them. YEAH! It was very busy since it was opening night, so it took long - understandable. The food was good, but my dish the fresh seafood mix was OK. Nothing that blew my mind for the price."}
{"text":"My guest and I had a great evening, from the great cocktail our amazing server Jimmy made us to the good food that followed! A lot had to do with the service, the weather and the vibe...I  recommend!"}
{"text":"I honestly couldn't care less if the service you received was rude or aloof. Even with this shortcoming, Manitoba is pure fucking decadence. Every plate was a delicacy, every dish a delight. The one complaint is that they were skimpy on the gravlax, but that's what I get for ordering a flat speck of fish. Even if you end up waiting 30 minutes to be acknowledged, trust me when I say that it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite hidden, since it's next to the famous Park avenue but with a twist... It's located in a quiet neighbourhood in Parc-Extension, not far from the vibrant Mile End. This restaurant offers a variety of specialty alcohol and their menu is for sure very very unique. When I first looked at the different choices of dishes, I was surprised to see some extraordinary choices of meat and fish, such as eel, deer, suckling pig, Arctic char and many others. The combination of different ingredients is also quite fascinating, for example they would prepare smoked eel with Jerusalem artichoke and knot root, and the taste of it is much better than it sounds! Usually I am not a big fan of artichoke, but the balance of taste of this dish was quite exceptional. I also tried the deer with malt cream, potato and mushroom, and that was REALLY delicious! The deer meat was juicy and tender, blending very well with the sensational malt cream and aromatic mushrooms, I really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I didn't read the other Yelp reviews prior to eating at this restaurant and was frankly surprised. I consider myself a bit of a \"foody\" and my colleague and I had to visit this place after reading the article in the New York Times food section. I have to say that we weren't disappointed. In fact, we were very impressed and had an incredible evening of drink, food and service. I had called the night before for a reservation and was told that they only had seats at the bar available, which worked out great. We started out with a \"Gin and Jam\" and a smokey whiskey cocktail. We ordered these after the bartender gave us a complete run down explaining our options. He did so enthusiastically and with pride. We then had the urchin, bison tartare and a split a dozen oysters. We were very impressed. They were all tasty and unique in flavor, texture and appearance. For our main courses the venison steak (which was prepared perfectly medium rare) and the bone marrow (one of the tastiest thinks we've ever eaten) were excellent. Of course the suggested wine pairing with each course matched perfectly and the Manitoba beer superb. In fact, I was able to sample a few different options before settling on an excellent Nero D'avola from Sicily with the main course. Our bartender/waiter was knowledgable and attentive. He even brought the sous chef, Becca and the pastry chef, Cristof over to meet us after they created a dessert sensation for us. The night caps finished off the meal wonderfully. All in all, this was a great eating event that lasted 3 hours. We've been to many places in the world to eat and this place ranks right up there with the most memorable evenings we've enjoyed."}
{"text":"Went to Manitoba for a long overdue dinner with friends.  The food was excellent, although I did find that the boreal flavours could have been a little bit more present since its the theme of the restaurant. I thought they were a little bit downplayed.  We had the spruce & spinach fresh pasta with braised hare and hemp nuts bread crumbs. A home run! It was fantastic, the pasta was succulent and the hare was tender. I couldn't taste the spruce too much in the pasta, hence my previous comment. We also had the  raw scallops, which were very good but less spectacular.  For the main course, we had the venison steak, which was served with celery root puree, cowberry compote and jerusalem artichokes. The meat was cooked perfectly, medium rare, and was extremely tender. The reindeer moss was mostly for decoration, it had no interest at all in terms of taste or texture. We also had the whole fish du jour, which that night was artic char. which was served with cauliflower puree and braised endives. Very good choice as well!  The tried both desserts, the panna cotta and the pie with meringue, and both were a great final note.  The service was top notch. Efficient, friendly, never missed anything. No complaints there.  The decor of the restaurant is beautiful. Partly industrial, partly rustic with the beautiful wood ceiling. The lighting was perfect as well. I enjoy restaurants with an open kitchen, always a pleasure to watch the cooks prepare the food.  Despite a few minor shortcomings, I would still go back anytime!"}
{"text":"There's a lot to like. The place looks great, the staff are enthusiastic and charming, the menu is innovative and challenging. If only the food tasted good... The deer dish was excellent, with mushrooms and potatoes. The duck not so much. And I really couldn't deal with the seal, found it truly repulsive, fortunately the woman could deal and she ate that. I like carbs with my meal, I don't mind if I have to order them separately but that's not an option at Manitoba. It's just an endurance fest of very rare meat. It had me running back to mile end's excellent pastries and bagels."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and have mixed reviews; sometimes the food is really salty, and then the next time it is the most delicious thing ever, you just never know what you're going to get. Also of note, their cocktails, although super yummy, are very overpriced, but their wine list is fantastic.  Last night we started off with the oysters and they were fabulous. They only came with a vinaigrette with small chopped onion, but that was ok as they didn't need hot sauce or lemon. Then I had the chanterelle mushroom dish which was freaking amazing: perfectly roasted with just the right amount of I don't know what the hell kind of sauce it was, but I licked the plate with my finger and didn't care that 7 people saw me do it. My companion had the pot stickers and he thought they were excellent and that the greens on top were great.  Had the white cake with fruits for dessert and it was dense yet not overly sweet, it was incredible (normally I'm not even really a dessert person, but I just had to have the cake after seeing the guy next to me have it!) They topped it off with honey ice cream, it was awesome.  The service to get our initial cocktail was slow, I waited about 15 minutes before anyone came over to help me and it seemed like half of the staff were busy on mushroom cleaning duty, drinking beers. If they can be friendly and more consistent, then I would definitely dine here more often.  On another note, I don't like that the terrasse is right on the street, but the garden in the back patio is pure bliss and a great spot to sip your first cocktail while you wait for your table to be set up. The beehives on the roof are a very cool addition!"}
{"text":"I ended up here the night the unveiled the new menu. When we walked in I immediately loved the way the place felt and the longer I stayed, the more I noticed the attention to detail in spots all over the restaurant. We immediately started with the cocktail list and although they were out of the drink I initially was looking for, I found an amazing cocktail instead garnished with a chunk of honeycomb made by their own bees. I can't remember the name, but it was exceptional.  With a sampling of starters, I ordered the most boring one... cauliflower soup. It was delicious, but I had some major food envy over my cohorts duck hearts and the balsam fir pasta. Luckily they were willing to share and I had a taste of everything. For my entree, I opted for the Arctic Char served with parsnip puree, roasted shallots, and an assortment of mushrooms. The dish as a whole was excellent although a little light on the portion of fish compared to the amount of roasted shallots on the plate. Maybe it's just the American portions I'm used to... who knows?  The service was a bit drawn out, but overall the staff was very accommodating. They kept the wine flowing and were genuinely interested in our thoughts on each component of the new menu. I enjoyed the whole meal, but the highlights were the duck hearts and the balsam fir pasta. Both were a must order. Don't forget about that honeycomb cocktail too!"}
{"text":"All throughout 2014, I kept hearing and reading great things about a new restaurant in the relatively obscure Mile-Ex neighbourhood - at least from a food perspective. A place that was doing some unique things in terms of local foraging and doing it in a cool setting. All of this talk made restaurant Manitoba one of the hit newcomers in 2014 and a place I dearly wanted to try out. After many months, I finally decided that I really needed to go before the summer was over so I made it a date night and brought my girlfriend along for what I hoped would a great experience for both me and her of course.  Located in the old industrial neighbourhood of Mile-Ex - stuck in the middle of Little Italy and Parc Extension, Manitoba is very unassuming as you approach - simply a wood terrasse in front of a simple door and window. Once you enter, it is truly a space in keeping with its neighbourhood and its approach of food - Industrial and clean but with touches of nature. A gorgeous bar along the left side of the room all the way to the open kitchen. The use of wood trunks on the ceiling with the light coming through them. The all-black wall and blackboard menu. The back garden and terrasse space with patio lights all a-glow. The vibe is hip and cool.  Service is attentive and friendly. It is surprising how I froze up at simply being asked if I'd had a nice day - not exactly what you expect from your waiter. Even the chefs were chatty and friendly as one of the sous-chef kindly answered our questions about some of the plants and herbs they use that we didn't know too well. We did have a bit of an issue with the service of our cocktails - way too long between the order and arrival of them - but otherwise great all around from the staff.   After a quick discussion with our waiter, we decided to start with the deer heart gravlax served with cauliflower puree, corn, sunflower seeds, labrador tea oil and stonecrop. What an awesome way to start a meal. The rich gaminess of the deer heart was not lost in the gravlax process. Add the creaminess of the puree, the sweetness of the corn and the little crunch from the seeds and this was a great balanced dish.  As a main dish, my girlfriend opted for the scallops from iles-de-la-madeleine served with lobster mushrooms, salicornia, green pea puree and emulsion. The scallops were nicely sized and wonderfully fresh with a beautiful sear all around. The beautiful lobster mushrooms brought a nice contrast to that freshness with their earthy tones. I was also very intrigued about the green pea puree and emulsion. An interesting bite of technique that maintained a strong pea flavour. Very good all around.  In my case, I decided to order something I had never had before: Maple brulé bone marrow served with chokeberry, maïtake, swiss chard and toast. From my vantage point watching the chefs use a blowtorch to burn the maple sugar made me pine for this dish pretty quickly. Bone marrow was something I suspected I would enjoy and yeah... turns out I was right. Definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea but dear god did I love this. Rich and fatty with a great sweetness and crunch from the maple syrup, I could have had many many more. The chokeberry mixture on top added some tartness and then add in some wonderful toast to put the whole mixture on top of.... just wonderful. Simply wonderful. In my mind, a must-try if it's on the menu.  After those great dishes, we were then left to decide on dessert. We ended up going with both options of the evening. First was a honey, indian celery and black walnut cookie served with raspberry ice cream and lichen dipped in chocolate. The cookie had a nice crunch with subtle hint of both the honey and the walnuts. The ice cream was smooth and flavourful and the use of lichen was an interesting component to bring forth.  The second dish was a spruce panna cotta with candied pumpkin seeds and wild blueberries. This was a very cool surprise. The texture you expect from panna cotta - rich and smooth - but the true surprise was just how strong the spruce came through. The combination of blueberry and pumpkin seeds were a nice pairing here as well. A strong finish.  Manitoba was what a had hoped for - a great unique mixture of dishes in a cool looking and feeling restaurant. As we sat outside in the back garden with a glass of wine partway through our meal, I thought to myself \"Yeah this is pretty great\". Pretty much says it all.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"En entrée: boudin noir, il était succulent! Plat principal: palourdes géantes servies sur de l'orge et bacon sur un court bouillon, tout simplement délicieux! Dessert: panacotta fumée et granola, rien de nouveau mais tellement bien exécutée! Le sévices était très attentionné: nous avons pu goûter plusieurs vins avant de faire notre choix. Superbe décor. Très bon rapport qualité prix. N'y allez pas si vous êtes pressés par contre...nous y sommes restées 3 heures."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night at the 6:30pm shift. They have 2 shifts at night. The first one starts at 6:30pm and the second one starts at 9:00 pm. And yes, they do ask you to leave at 8:55pm.  I liked the concept of the restaurant. The entire restaurant is one single room. You can see the bar and the kitchen from where you are seated.  The food menu is one page long you do not have many options. In general, I do like restaurants that do not propose a varied menu as you know that the restaurant placed lots of effort on the few available ones.  I ordered the Gin & Jam Sauvage.drink. It comes with a spoon of elderberry jam that is placed right on top of the glass. Before you drink it, you mix the elderberry jam with the gin. Hence, the drink gets red. The taste is sweet and lemony. I loved it !  For starters, I went for the Seal Tataki. At first, I was a bit reluctant to order seal. I felt very bad for the creature. The dish is served with raw seal, fried seaweed and concord grapes. The concord grapes adds a pinch of sweetness to the dish. I do recommend it. My main course was the deer. It served with mushrooms and potatoes with a tasty malt cream on the side. The deer meat melts in your mouth. And most important, it is not a fatty meat. This is why it is served with malt cream. I was able to taste the pig. It is very good but a heavy.  We had the Blueberry, yogurt and white chocolate for desert.  The waiters are very professional. They know well every dish. They can answer to all of your questions. You should see them how they clean the wine glass.  If you're an adventurous person seeking for new dishes, go to Manitoba."}
{"text":"Went for a brunch with a group of 3.  First of all, amazing coffee! I don't think half of the 3rd wave coffee shops in Montreal are serving coffee half as good as Manitoba.  Amazing food. -the only problem is that they could have put one more \"light\" item on the menu. I don't think everybody wants to eat rabbit in the morning."}
