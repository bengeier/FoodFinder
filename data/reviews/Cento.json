{"text":"We were seated in a booth near the kitchen. It was fun to look in and see the wood-burning pizza oven and to watch the meat slicer in action. I did think it was strange that the hostess was the one cutting the prosciutto on the meat slicer though, but she was wearing gloves, so that was good.

We ordered a number of things to share, starting with the Arancini and Beef Tartare. 

The arancini were good. Served four to an order, they were crisp on the outside and smooth and creamy on the inside served with a spicy tomato sauce. 

Beef Tartare: The waitress said that this dish has a following. People come in just to order this. My date and I had never tried anything tartare before, but we were feeling adventurous, so we went for it! I'm glad we did. I can't say that I'll be returning just for this dish, but it was a good experience. You get a relatively small amount of beef, but really, how much raw meat do you need to eat in one sitting? It comes on a massive salty cracker topped with a boiled quail egg, cheese, anchovies, and radishes. There's a lot of flavor just on that cracker. Break a bit off, add some beef and BOOM. You're hit with all those savory flavors and a crisp and cold combination. It's a little pricey at $13.00, but definitely worth a try.

My date is a big fan of mussels, so of course he wanted the Prince Edward Island Mussels. He really enjoyed them, served with pork belly, wine, tomato and garlic broth. He drank the broth without hesitation.

We also tried the wood-fired pizza with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella pearls, broccoli rabe, garlic and red chili flakes. Good flavors, but the crust was a little limp in the center of the pizza. Not sure if it was because it was too thin, or there was too much moisture on it, but it was a bit sad. Hopefully that was just a fluke though. 

Looking forward to going back to try more!"}
{"text":"We live downtown Madison and have eaten at nearly every restaurant. We get asked a lot for restaurant recommendations. I'd say we are fairly discriminating and know the restaurant scene in Madison. Our recent experience at Cento was way below average for a Food Fight operation. We sat at the bar, adequately staffed with 4 bartenders, on a Friday evening. The poor service we received was unacceptable. Where do I start...
No silver ware- had to ask
No napkins- had to ask
Water glasses empty- had to ask
Drinks empty - had to ask
Overall unattentive service that only responded when I ran someone down.  
Food was good. Not great. Bartenders were nice but clueless and had no concept of teamwork and customer service. It impacted our experience and was noticed by a couple next to us from Chicago, who were upset with their service as well. 
I spoke kindly to the manager at the end of the night to share my experience. He was receptive and thanked me. Even asking for my name and number so he could invite us back to give cento another chance. To make matters worse...he never called me back. 
Baffling! I won't forget this. Not sure I want to go back. I've since shared my experience with others. Remarkably another set of friends had a similar experience the next night at their large table foodies. 
Bottom line- I had much better service at the Echo Tap and the Big Ten Pub. Cento should visit and learn a thing or five."}
{"text":"The beef tenderloin was great. And we really liked the mushrooms too. Friendly service and nice drinks too"}
{"text":"This was our second visit and was better than we remembered! We sat at the bar and enjoyed a pizza and pasta. The food was delicious- my husband said it was some of the best pizza he has ever had. The service was wonderful and the wine was great. A fun, hip, busy place with great food!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars, but I believe this will become a 5 star review and quite possilby the best restaurant in Madison in due time. 

I went after it was open for only 4 days, and my meal was excellent but not quite perfect. I am pretty picky at expensive restaurants, and none of the minor flaws were things that would prevent me from returning. I had the hamachi crudo with crispy potatoes -- if each bite had a little of every garnish (especially the tiny lightly spicy pepper) it was delicate and delicious. But if the bite missed any of the many small elements on the dish, then it lacked seasoning. I also had manila clams which were delicious, light with a wonderful broth -- but there was a little grit in the broth. And I also had a half order of agnolotti with a pea sauce with shaved truffles. The flavor was absolutely out of this world, but it arrived at the same time as the clams, and the truffle was too strong to eat alongside the light clams.The housemade pasta was a little TOO al dente for my taste, but I understand that many chefs believe in leaving a \"bite\" to noodles and risotto that isn't to my taste. I was concerned the pasta would get cold if I ate it last, but it was just fine. So, a small plate, an antipasti and a 1/2 primi plus a nice glass of white wine ran me $70 with tip. So not cheap -- but a very elegant room and a really interesting menu. I am eager to go back and try several other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Terrific food, great atmosphere. The fish was tasty and the cocktails are outstanding."}
{"text":"Came here for a casual alumni group get together and couldn't have been more pleased!  Food was prepared ahead of time and brought out as guests arrived.  The staff was attentive to our needs as our group grew in size and took up more space at the bar.  The food was delicious- especially the meatballs and grilled vegetables!!  Drinks were tasty and reasonably priced! Would highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Not worth it

Cento is too expensive for what it provides.  The food and service were fairly good but not up to par for the prices that are charged.  I'll admit that I don't like spending a lot of money on dinner.  But I've done it on many occasions.  Usually I leave an expensive restaurant feeling like I've had wonderful food at a high price.  After leaving Cento I felt like I had good food at a high price.

The pizza was tasty, but not as good as Porta Alba's.  The gnocchi were pleasant, but they were so light that it seemed like mashed potatoes.  The bar was out of two different beers that I attempted to order from the menu.  That's not a big deal, but it's a minor frustration.

The service was good enough but our waitress wasn't as attentive as she could have been.  

These things wouldn't be significant problems in a lower-class joint.  But Cento seems to think highly of itself so I set my expectations accordingly.  I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing! We stopped in after a comedy show around 10pm and had a beautiful time!  Loved the wine, pizza and especially the cauliflower/ham dish!"}
{"text":"I thought I had reviewed Cento already. I feel guilty that I haven't! 

Cento is amazing! 

First I have to say that the staff is superb.  They are so kind and attentive, which always makes for a great dining experience. 

I stopped in tonight for a quick dinner and I was blown away.  Jordan, the general manager, stopped at my table a couple of times throughout my meal to see how it was and Krista, my server, was wonderful.

I got the beef tartare, which is one of my all-time favorites.  It was perfect as usual.  :) I also got the ahi tuna.  I had never tried that before and I have to say that it is now my new favorite.  It was topped with jalape√±os and apples.  That sounds disgusting, but it wasn't at all.  The spiciness from the peppers was tamed by the fresh tuna and offset by the tangy apples.  I have truly never experienced something so delicious.  

For my main dish I had a porchetta pizza, topped with brussel sprouts, pesto, and mozzarella.  Let me tell you a secret.  I HATE pizza crust.  I don't know what it is, but usually I just leave it.  I can't tell you if it is the fact that I haven't had bread in over a month or the fact that this crust was perfectly cooked/was salty and delicious, but I ate every last bite.  I want more.  

I ended with the bread pudding, which was served at the Elite event at Cento.  IT'S ON THE MENU NOW! YEAH! It was soooooooooo delicious.  I am happy that they put it on the menu and that I got a chance to try it. 

Thank you, Cento for an amazing dining experience!"}
{"text":".. A little inconsistent. Swordfish main dish was not hot, and overwhelmed by a (delicious) red sauce. 
Mixed drinks- very good, interesting, not weak.  
Wine pours- average and ok selection. 
Starters and salads- nice calamari; grilled romain was small and rather simple; next time would get.. Brussels sprouts, reported to be great. Mains- halibut reported excellent, hot when arrived; seafood medley, same. Swordfish, maybe try again but would make sure it arrives hot and perhaps less sauce, or on the side. 
Everyone Loved the tiramisu. 
Overall, Cento is somewhat overpriced, like I feel many Madison restaurants are. $150/couple with a drink each, shared salad, appetizer and dessert, and a main course each. Very pretty space, nice variety of foods and  drinks on menu. Service has been good most times I've dined, but this recent one was odd.. Pleasant staff but inexperienced and unconfident. (A wine glass from another table drops from your tray onto a customer, spilling some wine on them, you might offer a complimentary glass or dessert or something!) 
Hope to visit again, but for this price-range, it's likely L'Etoile for me."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and our server's heart was in the right place.  But...there were a few problems.  My sister and I ate there last Sunday evening and we ordered the octopus, the burrata and the special soup.  And we bought a bread basket.  All of the food came out at once.  So we had to decide between cold octopus or cold soup.  We put the soup plates on top of the bowls and started with the fish.  It was great and so was the sauce but there was no bread served with it so we used the sourdough we ordered and it really wasn't the right fit.  We had the soup next and it was delicious but it was so dark we had no idea what was in it or even what color it was.  We finished with the burrata.  It was a generous hunk of cheese but it came with two pieces of toasted bread--again, not enough, so we resorted to the sourdough.  I would give this place 5 stars if bread was included with the apps and if the lights were turned up just enough so the diners could see their food."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The food was creative and solidly prepared. Could have used some better ingredients to make it a bit fresher and brighter, but overall an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"We went to Cento last night for the first time.  Had a wonderful experience.

We had a booth looking out on the Christmas lights on the Overture Center.  Overall, the ambiance of the restaurant is upscale...feels like Chicago or NYC, not Madison.  (We live in Madison, so I'm not dissing it.)

Food was very good.  We started with the bacon wrapped dates.  I thought that they would be too sweet, but they were not.  It's a winner.  My wife had the tagliatelle, which she enjoyed; very rich, but also very good.  I had the snapper.  It was done perfectly.

Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Too expensive for the quality. Nice open kitchen and excellent specialty cocktails. Bacon-wrapped dates are worth the hype. The Mussels appetizer was a let down with gritty shellfish, a tasty broth that was difficult to eat without a soup spoon and a small hunk of burned bread. Speaking of bread...every dish cried out for bread but cost $3 for a minimal amount. If I am paying over $150 for dinner, give me some bread! The entrees were great but $35 for a small piece of fish with no sides (those are extra, of course) it was hardly worth it. The tiramisu was tiny and overwhelmed by a  giant scoop of frozen dairy for $9, also not worth the money. 

The best part of the dinner was the Vermouth on tap. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Cento, but sadly that was not the case. First off, the good. 

-The hostess were very nice and accommodating. 
-Our server was excellent, very attentive but not overbearing. 
-The decor was beautiful and I loved how open it was.

The bad...

-The food

My boyfriend and I ordered the fried squid, the wine poached beets, the black tagliatelle, the prosciutto wrapped branzino and the panna cotta. 

All of it was pretty bland and seemed to lack any sort of creativity with flavor profiles. The fried squid was very chewy, to the point that it was almost inedible. The prosciutto wrapped branzino had a really odd aftertaste and really lacked flavor. However the worst would have to have been the panna cotta. It was served in a bowl and you could tell that it had been uncovered in a fridge for too long. How do I know that? Well it had a layer on top that tasted of other foods that were not panna cotta. 

Overall my boyfriend and I left just feeling very underwhelmed."}
{"text":"My favorite place for high-quality Italian food in Madison. I visited Cento for the first time in March and had a mouthwatering pumpkin ravioli that is, sadly (at least for the moment), no longer available. Tonight I enjoyed the tagliatelle, which was delicious and came in a perfect portion. Our table also ordered the asparagus with almond pesto, which was incredible. I found the wine slightly over-priced given the selection, but the food more than makes up for it. Make your reservation well in advance, or try for patio seating upon arrival during the warmer months--would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!"}
{"text":"Two stars alone for simply willing to accommodate two people walking in (late) on a Friday night, no reservation...

It was my first time here, and it reminded me of Bottega Louie in LA. Simple little trattoria with excellent food and above-average service with an open kitchen. Our waiter was knowledgable and charming; I appreciated the attentive service we were given, despite venturing in on a whim later in the evening.

The rest of the evening was spent lingering over a bottle of wine and ordering way too much food, but it was all phenomenal.

My one deduction of a star is due to my personal preference when it comes to their bread, which is served \"charred\"- it's a very beautiful presentation but I can't say I love the way it tastes.

Other than that one minor thing however, I adore this restaurant and have plans to go back soon.

Delicious cuisine, comfortable ambiance and attentive service.

Thanks Cento!

Ciao,

Victoria"}
{"text":"Reserved a spot for the Kitchen Table, which is Cento's special tasting menu cooked for a maximum of 6. Absolutely delicious, with excellent wines (additional cost, but well worth it).

I won't dwell on the food, as the dishes are likely entirely different on another night, but I trust that you would receive equal quality and diversity (beef tartare, cheese plate, octopus, just three of the dishes).

I had also noted that this was for an anniversary dinner, and my wife and I both felt that everyone paid just a little more attention and made it a delightful night for us."}
{"text":"Absolute dynamite.  I dined solo on a business trip, and everything was beyond excellent, from the service to the wine to the burrata to the bread and finally to the Agnolotti, which was an amazingly rich mix of pasta with pumpkin and sage and walnuts in this butter/oil/starch mix.  I thought it was just unreal how good it was.  The price for all that was about $50, and it was one of those moments where I thought, \"Oh, I am so ready to abandon the over-priced, over-hyped, over-douchebag-populated restaurant scene of San Francisco, because this is so much better!\""}
{"text":"My dinner at Cento was the best I've had in Madison. The pizza's are amazing, and the calamari is one of the best I've had. Try the barrel-aged negroni, or carpano antica. Service was precise and friendly. I'll definitely go back every chance i get."}
{"text":"Date night at Cento, this was a good choice. You don't get the beautiful Capital Building views that you have at places like Harvest or Graze, but you do get perfectly done Italian cuisine. 

We started with a fabulous cured meats board and some of the most tender calamari that I've had. Then, followed up that flavor explosion with some killer pasta and sea bass. I'm quite certain that there isn't a bad choice on the Cento menu. 

I also found the service very pleasant and knowledgable, and just the right amount of attentive. The atmosphere is a little stark, but has its own unique charm. This place is definitely a competitor in the fierce Madison food scene."}
{"text":"I love the decor and the food looked good. We only stayed for drinks, but I would love to come back for the food!

We tried two of the bourbon drinks and loved both of them!"}
{"text":"Go there for brunch. Very affordable compared to other local brunch institutions and little to no wait time. Their eggs Benedict pizza and Lemon Capri cocktail (limoncello and espresso over ice) are TO DIE FOR."}
{"text":"Cento, hmmm. The mens' bathroom alone is a metaphor for how unfinished this place is. The caulk around the sinks is separated and clearly it was painted in the dark. At the convergence of the wall and ceiling is transparent brush strokes.

This translates to the food. Everything is just \"almost good\". The sauces with the pasta dishes lacked seasoning and depth of flavor. The carbonara was \"eh\" at best the guanciale (bacon) was rendered flavorless and was barely detectable...we were hoping to try shaved truffles with this dish and maybe that would have helped but unfortunately they are \"out...indefinitely\" (Then why is it on your newly printed menu?)

The black tagliatelle with a mix of lobster, mussels and a single under cooked prawn (tiger shrimp)...again...lacking flavor, depth and seasoning. We sent the \"prawn\" back and a disgruntled cook sent us an over cooked shrimp with the same tagliatelle redressed with a splash of cheese and horseradish instead of taking the time to do the dish again. 

Our starter was wine braised beets with goat cheese ('cause the girlfriend can't help herself when she sees goat cheese). It's not clear what kind of goat cheese they used but it was not a tasty-flavorful one. It might have even been cut with low-fat cream cheese. It was so bland. The beets...very little wine flavor translates.

The decent parts of our meal were the drinks...a young (not quite ready) barrel aged negroni. Though we were told it was young it was quite tasty. They brought us a sample to taste before we made a decision. We liked it and went with it. The service was kind but awkward...\"continue to enjoy\" is a statement that came our way more than 4 times. (Thanks for the permission.)

Our lamb was ribeye was a bit cold on the inside which is not quite med-rare. The flavor was balanced and the chimichurri was well tempered (though I would have enjoyed a bit more olive oil and some heat on the serving plate to keep the dish warm while we ate it. 

For dessert we opted for a digestivo that smacked of horchata with pistachio sprinkles. It was strong enough however and tasty enough so I can't complain too much. 

In all we were into Cento for $150+ for the two of us. The decor and food descriptions probably fool most people but for us we're experienced eaters and don't fall for the glitz. If you are looking to be impressed try the Eggplant Napoletana at Lombardino's. The people won't be as pretty and the decor is pure kitsch but that dish was better than all the dishes we had at Cento combined."}
{"text":"I was slightly disappointed after eating at Cento. I did have high expectations because it was a FoodFight restaurant and I have never been let down by one in the past. There was nothing specifically wrong with the food or menu, but it just seemed like there were small things that resulted in a disappointing experience.We started with the meat and cheese board, but the ratio between meat, cheese and bread was not proportionate. There was 3 times the amount of meat to what there was of cheese and bread. 2 small chunks of cheese and a tiny cup of honey was placed next to 2 HUGE heaping piles of meat. The items were all good quantity, but there was just way too much meat! I also ordered the burata,cucumber, tomato and crouton salad. The flavor combination was nice, but there was literally 3 tiny almost miniscule croutons that were more like bread crumbs. I was expecting something heartier. I ordered the mushroom, mustard green gnocchi. The quality of the food was great, but the flavor combination was off. I felt like they were trying too hard with the mustard greens and it just didn't work. It seemed like they were trying too hard to make everything unique and trendy. Altogether that quality of the food matched the price, but they could use some time to refine the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place and wish we could get here more often. Luckily for us, it's open on Mondays, a day that works well with our schedule.
The seating is cozy but the space is adequate. The food is simple but delicious. The gnudi and other pasta dishes are thoughtfully prepared with local and seasonal ingredients. The salads are tasty and the soups have never disappointed either. Reasonable prices, great service and delicious cuisine are the reasons we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding, the bacon wrapped dates have me starting to drool even now and the bruschette is nearly a meal in itself. 
So, the food is great, but that's not even half of the reason you should stop in. During happy hour, they have 1/2 off bottles of Laurent-Perrier champagne. Check out the menu, you can get a bottle of their Cuv√©e Ros√© for $76. This is the best sparkling ros√© on the planet and Cento is one of the only places in Madison that even serves it. Not down for a full bottle? They also have 1/2 bottles of the brut and demi-sec for $21. This alone will keep me stopping in anytime I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Came here for our first anniversary. Our server was Karina-she was great!!! Attentive, but not constantly coming by and bothering. Drinks we tried were Bud & Bloom & Three Pence. Both delicious. For dinner we did the Pappardelle & Margherita pizza. Fantastic choices. My husband practically licked his plate clean.  They gave  us free Tiramisu which was also sooo good. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"So we just had a pretty mediocre meal at Cento, which was surprising as we'd had a couple of really nice meals there before. We arrived at 10:30 for brunch and we were seated right away. Our server did a good job, though it seemed she was new to brunch (she brought us water and started to walk away without offering us coffee). She did fine. There were two main problems. First, the kitchen must have messed up our order because our food did not arrive until 11:15.  It took 35-40 minutes after we ordered, and several tables that were seated after us were already eating when our food finally arrived. We ordered pancakes, French toast and hash, so it shouldn't have taken that long. The second problem was
that our pancakes were burned to a crisp. To their credit, our served apologized before our food arrived and they did comp us our coffee for taking so long. However, I worked in restaurants for years... You don't send burned food out to customers. Period. See the pic."}
{"text":"The service here is almost too good. The decor is very elegant--I felt underdressed stumbling in after yoga class, which is noticeably uncommon for Madison. Although the food was delicious, there was nothing that absolutely demanded I come back to eat it again. I will be coming back though; I'm excited to see what this place can do once it's been open for more than a fortnight."}
{"text":"The best food I have ever eaten. In my life. Ever. 

Not a fan of dark restaurants, but if Chef Pruett served food in a dirty cardboard box I would come with bells on. From the dates to the pasta to the tenderloin to the ricotta cheesecake, course after course exceeded expectation. I never wanted it to end. And now I never want to eat anything else ever again. 

If you are visiting Madison, don't miss Cento."}
{"text":"Nice food, great service, lovely ambience! I took my mom here on her birthday, they gave us their best spot and treated us with a delicious appetizer and dessert of our choice! Definitely recommend this places! Dishes are worth the price!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cento several time for brunch, and also for cocktails. It is a great space in a wonderful location. Service is very good. Food has always been tasty as well. I recommend this spot for a date night or for pre- or post- show drinks."}
{"text":"Cento is an excellent addition to downtown Madison.  The space is fabulous...saving the best from the 1920's building and adding sleek new lines where needed.  The food was excellent and the desserts divine.  The manager, Jordon,  stopped by our table a couple of times to make sure everything was perfect.  He was attentive, professional  and charming without being overbearing.
All in all, a great new Food Fight addition to Madison.  My new favorite restaurant.  Perfect food, ambiance, wine list and cocktails and wonderful management paying attention to every detail."}
{"text":"Equisite environment and setting. Unfortunately, the food and overpricing make  it the emperors new clothes. A singular piece of chicken with no sides at $24. Everything ala carte with pricey sides and salads, paying more for a glass of wine than one would pay for a whole bottle.  That being said, it might be more acceptable if the food served was outstanding. It was not."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and expected impressive Italian food but was sadly disappointed. The food was just OK. Many of our dishes were quite bland. I recently had a Caesar salad at Ian's Pizza that was far superior to the salad I had here. Overall the dishes either lacked complexity or failed to properly blend the variety of flavors. The service was also disappointing. A salad and an entr√©e ordered by our group were both completely overlooked. At one point a woman came to the table to apologize. I assume she was in a managerial position but she never introduced herself. I can only conclude the staff has had minimal professional training. Lovely modern decor and great downtown location but I cannot recommend this restaurant based on the food and the service."}
{"text":"It was ok.  It was really nice that we called ahead and they held a bar table for us.  Beer and wine selection wasn't over the top.  Only had apps and they were ok.  
Fried artichokes were tasty,  more sauce was needed. The beet cold plate was disappointing.  Too much acid and no balance. The veggies looked like they had been cut by a 6 year old. 
 Oh well,  place looks decent and I thank them for sitting us promptly upon arrival."}
{"text":"Front desk staff was accommodating on a very busy night when I had made an error in our reservation.  The prosciutto pizza was delicious, as were our desserts.  The meal was well paced.  My only quibble is that going from dessert to paying and leaving for the theater was probably more drawn out than it needed to be, and we had to rush to make our show."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great Happy Hour!!  However, I think their wine pours are on the lite side.  Wine is expensive when it is not Happy Hour....$12 a glass.  Bruschetta was very good, and the price is right for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a superb Italian restaurant since moving to Madison eight years ago.  I believe Cento hits that mark.  I agree with all the previous comments on the atmosphere -- it was nice.

But, the highlight is that the food is well prepared.  Great ingredients, seasoned properly, and cooked to perfection -- from pizza to pasta to sandwiches.  By the way, we went for lunch, where the menu is shorter but so are the prices -- still great food -- I will now gladly go and spend money again on dinner.

Oh, and one of the best bloody mary's I've sampled in the area . . ."}
{"text":"Service was great!  Food only so so.  Enjoyed my cocktail of champagne, vodka and lemon sorbet very much.  Warm olive appetizer was excellent.  Daughter and I had fish, snapper and branzino, nothing special or flavorful although presentation was very nice.  Daughter's boyfriend had pasta dish which he said was good.  It was my daughter's 27th birthday, her dessert looked like a hot mess, they were out of the cake portion of the dessert and substituted something else.  Cheesecake was tasty.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"We ate here on Valentine's Day for lunch, a good way to avoid the crowds that swarm restaurants in the evening. I have to admit that we were underwhelmed with Cento- it was not bad, but it was not great, either. To be fair, the menu we were given was primarily brunch, and I hate breakfast food, so my choices were somewhat limited. I ended up with their burger, which is billed as \"the best burger in town\", and it did have a nice smoky flavor, and a bacaon marmalade which after a while became a bit much. 

We also ordered the butcher board, and I would absolutely not order that again. Maybe I'm not really that much of a 'foodie', but some things come off as more \"I dare you to eat this mystery meat thingy that might in fact be head cheese\".

The space is gorgeous, and I would certainly have a drink here before a show, but I'm not in a hurry to go back for the food."}
{"text":"I normally am not especially impressed with Food Fight restaurants, but this was one of the best dining experiences I have had in Madison. I highly recommend it. For two people, we spent about $75 with the tip. In addition to the entrees, we each had a drink, and we shared an appetizer and a desert. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"We went for our 10th anniversary. The service was stellar, the branzino (sea bass wrapped in prosciutto) was soooo good. The cheese and meat plate had hearty portions. You HAVE to try the dates, they are phenomenal. It's rare that a new restaurant would have their act together so quickly, but we've been there 3x in the first 3 months open, and it's consistently excellent. One word to gluten free folks. They have pasta, but tell your server to ask the kitchen to not boil it in the same regular pasta water! For celiacs that is not cool, and they did mention it when I asked for gluten free."}
{"text":"Get the butcher board, sit at the bar and down a couple of their Eliot & Ambroses....you're set."}
{"text":"We loved our meal in this great space. I am giving it 5 stars because we loved it even though it's going through \"new restaurant\" growing pains.
Lovely staff, great menu that is beyond what one could have made at home, which is hard to say about most Italian food.
The desserts: Poorly conceived and poorly executed. Tiramisu shouldn't be deconstructed precisely because it's the way the ingredients interact and melt in to each other that makes it wonderful. They left out crucial parts and left the others just lay there in the plate. So, call it something else. Italian food works best when it isn't overworked, over plated and lets the superior ingredients speak for themselves. Most of our meal was like that."}
{"text":"This weekend, I went to Cento for brunch for the first time (previously have had several decent dinners there). I had the omelet special, boyfriend had the eggs over easy.  The food was great, and little touches elevated it above standard-issue Madison brunch- his bread was grilled to crispy, savory perfection--way better than plain old toast. My side salad was dressed with a splendidly flavorful house balsamic dressing in just the right amount.  The veggies in the omelet were cooked perfectly- so were his eggs. Service was precisely on point (just as I've experienced at dinner). Prices aligned with portions. I've always thought Cento a beautiful space- it's more easily appreciated in the daytime.  Spotless and sparkling.  Why not five stars? Simply because I've not been wowed by dinner there yet. Will keep going back."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The charc platter and a cocktail after a show at the overture is the best. We biked here for brunch on Easter Sunday and it was delicious. Beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"All of the food was good, but a bit pricey for standard Italian dishes. Their cocktails are fantastic."}
{"text":"The four stars is 90% for the space and the design. Clean, modern, crisp, stark, simple, elegant. I love the warm lighting at night and open brightness of the space by day.

That all said, the food leaves something to be desired. I had high hopes for Cento but the food itself at both brunch and dinner, on a few occasions, was underwhelming. The food is sometimes poorly proportioned amongst its components in many of the dishes and very often under-spiced or under-seasoned.

The drinks and wine are quite good, though honestly.. enough with the grappa in like every drink. I understand you're an Italian restaurant.

The staff and service is generally friendly and fairly quick.

Overall it's an inviting and tempting space that just need to upgrade its main course offerings."}
{"text":"Food was decent, so was waitress. However, we asked for bread and turns out it's $3 for about 6 pieces of bread and butter. In my past, it's never been extra so my and my colleagues were just shocked to see a $6 charge on 2 orders of bread."}
{"text":"3.5-3.9 stars if I could!  Wine and wine presentation was great, pizza was delicious (the crust especially).  I wanted Cento to be SO so good based on what I've heard around Madison.  The bread was normal; my favorite thing about Italian restaurants is the bread!  It definitely was good but not 5 stars.  I'd give it another chance."}
{"text":"My fiance and I reserved the Chef's Table at Cento for our five year anniversary, and were immediately blown away! From the homemade squid ink pasta, to the signature cocktails, and the bread pudding to end the meal, it was more than we imagined.  

If you are looking for an intimate and special evening, I would highly recommend the Chef's Table.  Oh, and don't forget to interact with the kitchen staff!  They are there to answer all your foodie questions! After all, your table is in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"I almost never give a negative review. The food was terrible. Drenched in garlic and drenched in oil. So bad I wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The hostess was very pleasant and friendly, however, the waitress was not very good. The service was slow and not very accommodating. Usually this can all be overlooked if the food is delicious, but that wasn't the case here. The butcher board wasn't terribly offensive but the portion sizes were off. There were only two selection of cheeses but much more meat. The branzino was was much too oily and the side dishes (mushrooms and fingerlings) were both very salty. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and I would avoid if I were you."}
{"text":"While Cento did not have superlative Italian food, it was good enough and Cento provided a very pleasant dining experience.  As we tend to do, we dined at the bar, and service by a young man from Shorewood, Wisconsin was excellent. His honest recommendations were spot on, and the food was very good.  My Romaine (Caesar) Salad was excellent, and my gargantuan portion of Lasagne ridiculous, but hearty.  It was two or three meals.

Cento's decor is trendy modern and quite soothing.  Drinks were poured Wisconsin true, and the reasonably priced wine list was rather eclectic. Located downtown, within walking distance to the capital, Cento serves a growing need in Madison."}
{"text":"I religiously use Yelp but I rarely ever leave reviews (1 since 2011 and it wasnt a good one). My wife and I are in Madison celebrating our 1 year anniversary, from Chicagoland and we decided based on Yelp to check out Cento. Stick with me, this review gets better.

We made a 7PM reservation on Open Table. We get to the restaurant at 6:45, check in with the host and decide to go sit at the bar. 7:30 rolls around and there are a whole bunch of open tables at this point for us to be sitting in but the host had forgotten about us.

Long story short- they forgot about us then a fly ended up in my drink but the staff more than made up for it and so did the food. I got the pork and caramelized onion ragu and my wife got the fig and balsamic pizza- both were very good. We didn't order the charcuterie but we saw a station where the servers slice the meat and the cheese themselves on display for the restaurant. We were thoroughly impressed despite our rough start. Bartenders were great for the extended period of time we hung out with them and took care of us when we weren't happy. The server Paige was happy to be there on her holiday weekend and extremely pleasant. She made suggestions for us on the menu and they were a hit.

To Michael the manager and Paige our server and the bartenders- thank you for making our almost terrible experience the best 1st anniversary story and my first Yelp review in 6 years.

Highly recommend this place not only for their delicious food but also for the people they employ.

See you next year."}
{"text":"When I came home after my lovely vacation in Italy, I missed the food. I was craving for Italian food. I missed the fresh and unique taste, the culture, and the ambience of it all. So I did what everyone would do. Look up restaurants in Yelp. I came here with a friend of mine and the food was AMAZING!! It definitely took me back to Italy! I loved everything! I told all of my friends about this place! This place gets super packed so make sure you call ahead and make a reservation!! It'll be worth it! The waiting staff is so friendly and knowledgable. Love, Love, Love this place! They have great food, excellent service, and delicious drinks and desert! The decor is so beautiful, definitely a good place to bring your lover for a romantic evening. I love this place! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was the second of two legendarily satisfying meals that I had during my workweek in Madison, the first being Heritage Tavern.

Again, I went with several coworkers, and again, there was much sharing of dishes - but the sharing was more focused this time, which was perhaps due to the overall presentation.  With the exception of one person, we all had identically-sized bowls, and the only smaller dishes that I can recall belonged to my arancini appetizer and someone's side of asparagus.  (A quick note about the arancini: it was spicy, as advertised, with an admirably sturdy crust and a rich and creamy rice filling.  Top-notch starter.)

Our entrees were: risotto (mine), pumpkin agnolotti, orecchiette, tagliatelle, garganelli, and a small pizza (the only thing I didn't sample).  There wasn't anything whose ingredients disappointed.  Where there was sausage, it was hearty and intense; where there was pasta, it was wonderfully tender and a far cry from the boxed stuff we all knew; vegetables were well-selected for their dishes and perfectly cooked.  The braised short rib meat in the garganelli was supple, and the risotto's only \"flaw\" was that I actually found it too rich to finish in one sitting. I'll also mention that I'd not previously had the risotto's particular combination of flavors - butternut squash, walnut, and pecorino - and the complexity easily made me, a compulsively fast eater, take my time.

No, the ingredients were all first-rate, but there was something else that distinguished the dishes: their sauces.  At the end, we each had a bowl with leftover sauce, and it didn't take long for us to declare a unanimous victor: the orecchiette.  For that one, the menu listed only sausage, spinach, tomato, and pecorino, omitting, I'm sure, whatever magic unknowns that lifted the sauce head and shoulders above the rest.  We obtained some bread from our server and promptly set about dipping into each others' bowls like a bunch of white-collar barbarians.  I wondered aloud if it would make sense for the restaurant to offer bread by default, forgetting, of course, that the carb/starch requirement was already fulfilled by the pasta itself.  

The decision to go to Cento was a last-minute switch away from another place, and how glad we all were for that switch.  If we lived in the Madison area (and had our employer picking up the tab for lunch every time), I'm sure we would endeavor to slowly work through the rest of the menu.  As at all the best places, we would feel safe in picking anything and expecting it to be at *least* superb.  Well done, Cento."}
{"text":"Strolled into Cento before going to a show recently and was pleasantly surprised to find out we scored the Kitchen's Table. To clarify, we didn't have a typical Kitchen's Table experience, which includes paying $100 a plate to enjoy a specially curated seasonal menu while you get to rub shoulders with famous Chef. 

Our seating was a fluke, but I'll take it what I can get! It took the dining experience to a whole new level. We watched them cook pizza in the wood fire oven, prep food, and set dishes. Like watching Chef's Table IRL. And we enjoyed the privacy away from the rest of the restaurant. I would pay the hundo to enjoy this experience again on a special occasion. 10/10 would recommend.

All the dishes we had were simply sublime. We started the the bacon-wrapped dates. I'm not normally down with dates, but wrap em up in bacon, place in fresh sausage, piquillo-pepper sauce and you cannot resist. Next came the orecchiette. Hot diggity. Simple dish that blows you away: Italian sausage, spinach, tomato, pecorino. The sauce was light and almost soupy, with a powerful but not overbearing savory flavor. 

We also squeezed in just in time to make the tail end of happy hour (ends at 6pm). Wine was $5 a glass! Can't beat it for the quality; legs for days on those glasses. 

Bottom line: Cento is it. It's one of the best restaurants in Madison, and the hype surrounding is justified."}
{"text":"The husband and I stopped here for dinner before catching Jersey Boys at the Overture (see my other review for that!). We not only had a gift card for Food Fight restaurants from Christmas, but we also had two coupons for free appetizers. On that note, I highly recommend signing up for their e-mail club if you know you will be going here for dinner in the future. Free appetizer coupon just for signing up, and other coupons sent out periodically.  
One of our appetizers were the bacon wrapped dates. They were good-- sweet, carmalized and smokey. However, I didn't enjoy the sauce with it as much as I hoped. Too much sauce and not enough of it would stick onto the bacon to really get a good taste. Our other appetizer was brushetta, which is on special during their after-work and late-night happy hours. Highly recommend this appetizer. It was a large slice of fresh bread piled high with our choice of pesto and pulled pork with arugula. So delicious and easy to share. 
For our main course, I got the papardelle and my husband got the casarecce. Both were good pasta dishes and good prices for the amount of food you got. I wish we had been able to take leftovers, but going to the show afterwards kind of put that option out of reach.
Because we had a gift card, we splurged for dessert with the apple & cranberry bread pudding. Out of all the things we ate that night, this was my favorite. It was perfect sharing size, warm from the oven and sweet without being too sweet. The candied walnuts were a perfect addition. 
If you want a fancy night out, or maybe just a cocktail and brushetta with friends, I definitely recommend Cento."}
{"text":"Yikes!  We could title this one, how to lose 5 stars in 90 minutes.

TLDR Version:  Reservations mean nothing so don't make one if you're leading up to a show or other hard stop, terrible service by an immature, incompetent waiter, and mediocre food.   Go elsewhere!  Definitely the Food Fight Group's worst restaurant!

1.  Show up a couple minutes before 7.00pm reservation, host informs you that your table is \"just getting to dessert now\" and it will be 15-20 minutes before it's ready, and encourages you to get a drink at the bar.   Newsflash:  I'm pregnant, and neither of us are drinking, so we awkwardly occupy two of the 10 bar seats waiting for our table.  My husband felt so uncomfortable not ordering he finally caved and got a beer  20 minutes later...
2.  Seated!   Waiting.  Waiting.  Waiting.  Waitress (Vivi, according to our check) takes 5 minutes to even show up!  She asks if we want a bottle of wine, and we respond that we're fine with water and the beer my husband carried over from the bar and she acts put-out, and leaves to get a water pitcher to fill our glasses.  Doesn't return for 10 minutes.  Note to waitress:  We know you're 18-22 in a party school town, but pregnancy is a thing for folks in their early 30s, and alcoholism is real too, acting annoyed your table won't increase the tab by ordering alcohol is wildly unprofessional.
3.  My husband asks for more information on the lamb and pork entrees, the waitress makes it clear she thinks both meats are disgusting personally, and says we should get chicken because chicken is better. (Not at the restaurant, mind you, but is the meat she personally prefers when she eats, which is not what we asked.)   My husband orders the pork, but spends the next 5 minutes wondering why our server cannot give info on the flavors and preparation of two major menu items.  Newsflash: most nice restaurants have their new servers try a small plate of every big dish and review notes on its prep/flavors so they can inform guests, regardless of their personal preference!  
4.  We ordered the bread as an appetizer.  25 minutes later our bread shows up - we watched it get cut and set-out on the prep counter 10 feet away, 15 minutes earlier and our waitress spent the entire time holed-up in the waitstand, presumably texting, chatting and doing anything other than serving her tables.
5.  Food comes out 5 minutes after the bread.   Totally forgettable.  My husband's pork was okay - but he was disappointed by the minced veggies that were more part of the sauce than a side.  Usually for that price, you get the meat and appropriate sides - this was nothing - perhaps in a scam to get folks to order a few $10 sides?!   My chicken parmesan was burned on all edges, and leathery/tough when chewing.  The marinara was completely bland tomato sauce with no seasoning.    When food was delivered the waitress tried to leave and I had to raise my voice to call after her to ask for more water - my glass was empty.  How no manager, busser, or my server noticed in the prior 10 minutes and did not refill at a restaurant of this price-point is beyond me.
6.  We were so over the terrible service and mediocre food, all we wanted to do was leave.  Our server didn't return until 15 minutes after we were clearly finished eating, and again got miffed when we declined dessert and asked for the check.  Bringing the check again took almost 10 minutes, and another 5 to return it.

The sad part was that it was our 8th anniversary, and we couldn't help but longingly stare across the street at the Overture where we had our reception, and another Food Fight outing (Catering a Fresco) provided dinner for 150 (read: bulk cooked) that was amazing and 10x better than a dinner that cost far more per plate at Cento. Unsurprisingly, neither the host nor waitress even asked if we were there for any special occasion either... Though we watched other tables be surprised with anniversary and birthday desserts with candles during our meal...

We have to hope the table proceeding ours was just unreasonably slow, we got poor counsel on ordering and were not steered toward the restaurant's best dishes, and our waitress was just wildly inexperienced or having a very, very bad day.   Friends and family who insisted this was the place to go were horrified to hear we had such a bad time, but terrible it was.   

Walking to the bar from the host stand we joked that we were hungry and didn't want to wait....what if we blew off our reservation, went around the corner and grabbed Ian's pizza, and enjoyed it on the capitol steps like when we were broke grad students?   Lesson:  Go with your instincts!"}
{"text":"Food: 2 STARS. I was just completely unimpressed. 
Service: 5 STARS
Ambiance/Space/Location: 4 STARS

My lower review is based strictly on food quality. Will try again- and re-assess."}
{"text":"Went to Cento with a group of 7 and we all had the boozy brunch, quite a few options to choose from and it includes two drinks.The hostess and waitress were pleasant and we had a nice conversation with the chef. Everyone enjoyed their different brunch and drink options and the Salami hash was awesome. Alot of parking ramps nearby.Cento was a great value for the quality and price! I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I give Cento a three star due to service today only. Our meals were absolutely fantastic.

This was my first visit to Cento. Our server asked us if we wanted to do the brunch special they do there that included a pastry, 2 cocktails, entree and bottomless coffee for $25. Little did he tell us, they were out of pastries. Many people in my group were excited about this part of the deal and the waiter said nothing and when we asked at the end of the meal what happened, and where they were, he said they ran out and offered us \"bread\". It was just really distasteful to me how it was handled. If we hadn't asked, nothing would have been said. 

Our table has ordered the charcuterie board, salami hash, seasonal omelette and salmon bagel. We all were thrilled so it's really unfortunate that we felt misled by our waiter to purchase the deal that we couldn't benefit fully from. I would really recommend any. 

This venue is also super cool, classy, trendy and slightly upscale. I loved the decor."}
{"text":"Everything was very good about this restaurant from the food to the ambience to the wait staff. It was all outstanding. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the issue with the bread. Every other Italian restaurant I've been to, the bread and oil is complimentary. Here, they charge you $3. Now, I'm not complaining about the price, but just the fact that they actually charge a fee.  And the bread is just OK, at best.  Also, because we had to pay for it, we felt the need to devour all of it, which is something we usually don't do. But that aside, we really enjoyed the restaurant and will most likely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really beautiful and has some delicious choices on the menu! 

They just recently got a new head chef, and so some of the items that were on the menu before are temporarily taken off. 

There is a pumpkin stuffed pasta dish that is absolutely incredible. It's probably some of the best pasta I've ever had. They have taken it off the menu for now but I hope it returns. It was slightly sweet and had a balsamic glaze that gave it an extra depth of flavor. 

The tagliatelle is also really delicious. It's creamy and full of ricotta. Definitely recommend!

Calabrian salad was alright. I'd ask for dressing on the side, because it was a bit much!

The Margherita pizza was pretty good but be warned, they are not normal sized pizzas. They look more like slightly larger than average personal pizzas. Perfect for 1, not enough to split."}
{"text":"I'm impressed.  

Yes, it is expensive. Yes, it is not authentic italian. But Cento has won me over with their PORCHETTA EGG BENEDICT. 

Ever since I've had it two weekends ago, I've been counting down the days to till when I'll be able to savor it again. mmmm delicious. I didn't realize brunch was available at Cento, but after missing farmer's market breakfast, I came by and that was the best choice ever! 

Service was a little slow, but our server was apologetic and brought us sourdough and butter to soothe us during our wait. Mmm, warm bread and butter was extremely delicious. 

The porchetta egg benedict is currently my favorite breakfast item in Madison. I love pork but porchetta sometimes could be too heavily spiced or fatty. But the hollandaise sauce went perfectly with the porchetta, and there was just the right amount of fat with the meat. Ohhh it is so delicious. The egg was perfectly poached, runny as I like it. Bread held up well to the ample amount of hollandaise sauce. Oh so delicious. And, to make you feel healthier it comes with a delicious side of salad! Great vinaigrette! 

I also tried the frittata with proscuitto and arugula. It was good but the frittata could be better flavored. I loved the breakfast potatoes but it was too salty. The garlic aioli and spicy marinara sauce we requested was great to cover the saltiness of the potatoes. And I must note that brunch is totally affordable, just like going to Graze or any other brunch place in town. 

Dinner was more expensive, but also really delicious. My favorites are the ragu pasta (with orange zest), seafood pasta (squid ink pasta is delicious!) and brandino (I've never like eating a whole fish better. They deboned it! And so delicious). 

Oh and please please please have the bread pudding on the menu! It is the best bread pudding I have had!!! the apples in there are so delightful. And the sides of the pudding are like a pie crust, giving great texture. So good!

And you can make reservations on yelp via opentable! How convenient!! 

Verdict: come enjoy to celebrate a special occasion! Or, every weekend for brunch ;)"}
{"text":"Came for NYE.  Beautifully decorated.  Waiter was nice.  Cocktails were unique and tasty.  3 course menu had neat options and portions were perfect.  Highly recommend for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"Love this place! Favorite restaurant in Madison. I don't live there anymore, but when I returned for a visit, this is the first place I went. They take reservations on Open Table and I suggest making one, especially on nights when there are shows at the Overture center because they get really busy.

I always start with a glass of prosecco or wine and an order of the bacon wrapped dates! They have a large selection of wines and the dates are amazing. I've tried almost all the pizzas and pastas, and none of them have disappointed. My favorite pasta is the Tagliatelle. I pretty much get that every time now and don't try anything new - when you find something that works, why change? 

I also have to give this place 5 stars for service. One time when I ordered the Tagliatelle, it was mostly sauce. There wasn't a lot of pasta. By the time I finished eating the pasta, I was left with a plate of meat sauce. I pointed this out to the waiter, and asked if I could just have more pasta to mix in with the sauce. Instead, the chef made me a brand new dish (a little smaller than the usual because I requested it be a small portion) and I got to take lots of leftovers home. Anytime I've had an issue, they've always addressed it quickly and with a smile."}
{"text":"Very convenient for concerts at The Overture Center. Excellent food and service. A bit loud when full but not oppressive."}
{"text":"I met a friend for drinks and appetizers here on Monday night. I had only been here one other time for an anniversary dinner with the hubs, and I was looking forward to coming back! Our waitress was very sweet; she had great suggestions and was knowledgeable about the menu. Service in the bar area felt just a little slow but it was a busy night. 
My cocktail was one to remember - smoke & roses - I loved it, but it definitely had a smoke finish.  We shared the Butcher Board which featured three standard meats, two cheeses that are pretty easily found locally (moody blue and an aged cheddar), and just a bit of honey. Portions were great, but nothing stood out with that one except for the fight over the honey! We also shared the seared Brussels sprouts and these were fantastic. Loved every bite! The spice of the salumi was perfect contrast to the honey and ricotta in this dish. For dessert I tried the carrot cake and I was actually pretty disappointed in that part of the experience. It came out cold, like it had been refrigerated, with an excessive amount of shaved almonds on top of it. However, a very wonderful scoop of salted caramel gelato next to it gave me a sweet finish to the night.  Overall I think Cento is a great addition to the fantastic line up of choices we have for eating out downtown!"}
{"text":"Awful. I had to return my salad, which was miracle whip on a romaine leaves.... horrible! I never return anything. Main dish... pappedelle=white bean and ham soup poured over fake noodles. They must buy the cheapest mass distributed products and then slap a ridiculous price on it for profit. I actually was disgusted the entire evening trying to get the flavors out of my mouth and memory of my first bite of that salad out of my head. Then the cook happen to be outside smoking a cigarette and heard us discussing how horrible our meal was and argued with us that it was good and the prosciutto comes right from Reinhardt foods. Ha! Exactly"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  I've eaten all around the world and the steak (with fennel side) is one of my favorite meals ever. 
The service is great and the drinks rock. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Excellent addition to Madison restaurant scene. Feels a lot more like NYC than Madison. Great ambience, great d√©cor, fantastic menu, service and food and affordable prices, too.

The bar area is very nice and cocktails list is impressive, I tried one with prosecco, vodka and lemon sorbet and it was great and only $7! The booths have high walls so it's a very private setting if you take a booth. For appetizers we got well-presented olives bar for $5 (plenty of olives and good variety and they were warmed) and cured meat and cheese plate, that was $15 with ridiculous amount of food, easily enough for 6 people. 3 types of cured meat and 2 types of cheese, everything was delicious.

All pasta menus are available in half portions. we had black tagliatini for $15 and branzino wrapped in prosciutto and everything was very tasty. We also had two desserts for 3 people and that was a mistake as desserts were big so one is plenty to share among 3 people. Good list of dessert drinks as well.

Service was spectacular, very timely, we never felt left without attention and the waitress was very nice. We also had couple managers stop by and ask how everything went. Our total bill was $47 per person before tip for appetizers, entrees, desserts and more than one drink per person, I would say it's great price for such level of food and service.

The only thing that could be improved is density of the seating: add more high-top tables and more tables overall, otherwise the place feels just a tiny bit too underfilled.

Overall this is my new most favorite place in Madison. Will come here for drinks instead of Merchant."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and efficient. A lively atmosphere typical of upscale eateries without linen table cloths or many soft furnishings. The menu is a somewhat expected list of Italian food copied from restaurants that have been doing inventive, contemporary Italian dishes over the past 5 years. The execution and quality were good, except the sauces seemed more typical of a moderate priced chain. There is better Italian in Madison for the price."}
{"text":"Sad to say I struggled between 3 and 4 stars for this one - it was actually the exceptional service that pushed me to give Cento 4 stars. I was expecting a little bit more out of this place and have to say left a little disappointed! 

I made reservations for myself and a client online - super easy. Love that they take reservations (so many restaurants downtown do not)! We started our meal with the Butcher Board and Fried Squid. Both were delicious! The meats and cheeses on the board were perfect, especially with the crusty bread and honey. The Fried Squid was also very good, not greasy at all. The romesco sauce on the bottom made them really stand out from others I've had.

My dinner meal was where I was disappointed. I was told by our waitress that the Gnocchi were very popular. So I tried them. Maybe I've been eating Gnocchi wrong my entire life (doubtful since I've been to Italy) but they were much too soft. I think someone else already mentioned it in their review, but it was almost like eating mashed potatoes with a butter sauce. I did not enjoy it at all. Also, there were pearl onions in the dish (not noted on the menu) which I really, really hate.

For dessert I got their Budino to go. I ate it the next day - small portion but it tasted good. I was glad the cookie stayed nice and crisp instead of getting soggy from sitting in my refrigerator. So like I said before, was I disappointed? Yes. For such an expensive meal I would have preferred to enjoy my entree as much as I did the appetizers. Would I return to give it another shot? Absolutely, just not for the Gnocchi."}
{"text":"It's a cool spot and something a little different for Madison. The food was very wood-fire roasted and by that I mean full of flavor and goodness but also rather charred and salty. I can't put my finger on whether I loved it or felt like it lacked finesse. 

The wait staff is very attractive - noticeably so. Odd, right? I feel like there's normally a bell curve that mirrors humanity but here it looked like they stood the candidates up in a row and hand picked the pretty people. So...I guess depending on what you are looking for, that could be a plus!"}
{"text":"This was the most underwhelming dining experience I've had in quite some time. We were very excited to try this place after hearing great reviews from friends, etc. To say that this restaurant is overrated is spot on. Service was terrible - server had very little knowledge of the menu and wine list. 

From the time we walked in the door we were rushed through our meal even though the restaurant was half-empty (on a Friday night - very telling).  We received our drinks after our appetizer, and the entrees ordered which the server gave rave reviews, were severely lacking in flavor - a little salt would go a long ways and the chef obviously didn't taste the dishes before they were served.  

The fish (branzino) was over-cooked and very oily - nothing like described, and the pappardelle was raw (yes, I know the difference between al dent√© and raw - this was raw) and very doughy with poor flavor.  The lamb was also lacking salt and may have been palatable if it were provided, but there was none on the table and our server was nowhere to be found, acting so timid because she knew we were unhappy with the flow of our dinner and lack of expertise regarding the wine list.  It was like a 3rd string quarterback was put in the game to serve our party of 4.

Dessert was chosen based again on the recommendation of the server and when it arrived on the table, the presentation was so unpalatable it looked like we were served a pile of something that came out of the rear end of an animal. Again, nothing like the server described. 

The ambience was loud, hard to carry on a conversation, and while eating a woman fell off of her high-top chair and no staff even took a second look or asked if she was ok. She was not drunk but was wearing a long, formal dress and it caught on the chair she was on - very poor decor and dining design.  

For the price we could have gone to any chain restaurant and had better service and much better food. Very, very, very disappointed!!! Don't waste your time, there's better dining experiences in Madison!! It almost seemed like the ambience was supposed to make up for a lack of service and terrible food, but although it was pleasant, the ambience was far from fine dining.

Pic of the abysmal chocolate poo dessert is attached - the chef and owners should be embarrassed to serve this."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars: Went to Cento tonight to celebrate my birthday. The restaurant is gorgeous--the lighting, location, seating, everything. It's clearly designed to impress. However, my dinner was not as impressive. My husband and I started with the bacon wrapped dates. These were sweet and savory little bites in a red pepper sauce and we enjoyed them. We then ordered the butcher board, which consisted of bread (tasteless), two cheeses, and three meats with a small jar of honey. This was entirely \"meh.\" The meats and cheeses were tasty on their own, but together it wasn't impressive. We both then had the tagliatelle with ragu. Prior reviews said that some dishes needed salt. I would've loved to add salt to this. It was bland and one note. I was glad that it was a smaller portion. My entree was the Seafood Stew, which was my favorite part of the meal. I enjoyed it a lot, although the tomato \"stew\" reminded me of jarred spaghetti sauce. The seafood was delicious, however.  Service was prompt and timely, although cool and robotic. 

We will likely give Cento another shot after some time had passed."}
{"text":"Came here for a business dinner with an Open Table reservation on Sunday night.  The food was all good, especially the buratta app and fried artichokes.  I had Arctic Char, which was delicious.  We drank a LOT of wine.  The kindly moved us to a booth since the tables were very loud and we were in on business.  Service was great.  It was not  my type of place, but for work, it was a solid choice."}
{"text":"Cento is a top notch destination for sumptuous offerings before or after a show at Overture, a concert at the Orpheum, or, like tonight, a movie at MMoCA. With one of the better wine vaults in Madison (Rare might just eke that one out), I lucked out with a special Chianti Reserva pour from the 'Chef's Table'. It paired wonderfully with the steak tartare (beef, hard boiled quail egg, parmesan, anchovy, tuna sauce, herb salt, ans sea salt cracker) served on a cross-cut piece of wood. 
While probably not on the standard 4 course menu as a follow up, I'm a sucker for clam chowder. Tonight was a seafood chowder. The chianti really helped release the flavors and spices of the wonderfully thick chowder....if they'd have put a side cracker with it, you'd still have a crisp snap, and plenty of crumbs, dunking it in the bowl.
If you like Italian, this is one of the 'must hits' in Madison. Michael Pruett's staff knows what they're doing and every visit is a treat!"}
{"text":"We ended up finding Cento last minute and it was a wonderful choice. Karina (our server) was absolutely amazing and went above and beyond with the kids. The menu could have had a bit more variety that was the main downside. Everything was tasty from appetizer to dessert. Will be stopping by next time life finds me in Madison."}
{"text":"Tentative 3 stars, pending a better showing next time. Came here for brunch on Valentine's day, our fault for not paying attention to what day it was. We didn't have a reservation, so the dining room was off limits, but we were able to get a spot to sit at the bar with no problems. We both got coffee, no booze, though some of the stuff on the menu looked pretty good. I ordered the biscuits and gravy, the pancetta-buttermilk gravy, and a side of sausage, because since I was getting pancetta in my gravy, I didn't want to double up and order bacon (see what I was going for there?). And my friend got the salami hash.

My friend was perfectly happy with his food as far as I could tell. The meal was very pleasantly presented. My biscuits and gravy, well...not quite what I ordered. I was anticipating pancetta-buttermilk gravy, instead I got something that was orange and spicy with sausage in it. Ok, I get that a lot of places change up things on their menu according to food availability of the week blah blah, and that's fine, but just tell me!! Don't let me order something knowing what I read in the description is not what's coming on my plate. And remember when I ordered sausage instead of bacon for my side to avoid doubling up? Well, thanks for foiling those plans! On to the taste. The biscuits were ok, a bit dense, but still minimally acceptable. The gravy was too heavily salted, which made the bits of sausage taste even saltier. The breakfast potatoes were nice and crispy, well half of them were. The other half were overly crispy to the point where I felt was eating a potato chip cube. The taste was good though.

So maybe we came on a bad day. Holiday brunches are hectic days, but given the calibur of staff, I wouldn't expect them to be this thrown off by V Day brunch. I was a big fan of what chef Pruett put out back when he was at Steenbock's, so haven't lost hope for Cento yet. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"This is a nice hip Italian place on Capitol Square. The atmosphere is perfect for a date night. My wife and I ordered a spread of food since we were pretty hungry! We started with the meatballs as an appetizer. These were moist, delicious, and obviously homemade. We really enjoyed them.

For our main course, I had the Tagliatelle and my wife had the Potato Gnocchi. I really liked the Tagliatelle. I tried some of the gnocchi and it was also delicious. The service was quick and friendly which really made the entire experience great. Everything we tried tasted freshly made.

If you're looking for an elegant Italian restaurant, I highly recommend Cento!"}
{"text":"To start, the restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. Since we were there a little before the dining room opened, we each got a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. We were seated in a nice, roomy booth by the window, but it was FREEZING. My date and I were both cold, feeling the cold radiate from the window and blowing from the vents! Luckily they were able to move us and the restaurant warmed after a while. I think they perhaps turned the heat off between breakfast and dinner?

The food was good, and everything had a really nice presentation. I felt mine was good though nothing super special. The butter lettuce salad was nice, as was the pasta with tomato sauce and ricotta. It wasn't quite what I expected and was relatively basic. That is disappointing for a vegetarian--there are so many exceptional things you can do with pasta! My date had the tartar as an appetizer and the mussels as an entree. The mussels were very good, and the sausage kind of a surprising addition. The tartar, however, won the day--the whole day. He loved it and said it was absolutely the best part. 

The dessert we had was the chocolate salumi. It was dense, dry, and rich. I think we chose wrong! It was okay, but I wouldn't order it again.

The service was very good. I would come back and perhaps try some different things."}
{"text":"Cento reminds me of my favorite restaurants in New York. This place is on my top five list for Madison. One of my favorite things to do here is just order every appetizer. There is so much happening on the cheese plate alone that your mouth will water the moment it is served on the cool wooden platter. Follow that with the Octopus and be transported to a culinary delight beyond your expectations. (I guess I like it!)"}
{"text":"I wanted to give Cento four stars! I have been here once before and it was a tasty, lovely meal.

Cento has this classic, upscale decor, nice sized booths and a fancy looking bar. 

They have interesting choices of pasta and pizzas, however, their antipasta game is lacking. 

We tried their mushroom and truffle pici, and their prosciutto pizza... They would have tasted much better if they weren't so heavy on salt. Prices and portions are decent though!

A good selection of wine and cocktails!

I would recommend making a reservation if you are coming here on a weekend night. Happy hours are I believe after 10pm, so that's also a good deal if you wanna give Cento a try!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Cento after several recommendations. The place has a nice vibe inside. We went to the bar before dinner to have cocktails. There are some good deals for their happy hour--cocktails around $5. I recommend the Cento Americano. Dinner was very nice. I enjoyed the octopus as an antipasto but would've liked more than 3 tentacles. It had a great mix of textures and flavors. I wasn't sold on the mussels antipasto--was kind of one dimensional and bland and came with an over-charred piece of bread. The flavors in the bread were great, but the taste of charcoal dominated. For dinner I had the seasonal risotto which was excellent. I tried some of the orecchiette with sausage which was also good. Dessert great. We tried the chocolate crunch cake and the affogato. Both were excellent. If you love espresso, the affogato is a winner. If you're more of a chocolate lava cake person, go for the crunch cake. Overall, great experience and prompt attentive service."}
{"text":"This was a decent place for a meal. The wine poached beets were delicious. The lamb was tender and well flavored, and the risotto was delicious. The tiramisu was a take on tiramisu, which was disappointing to say the least. The space is modern and stylish. This is not old school Italian, but if you are looking for a more modern concept, this place is good."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat, we found a place downtown on Yelp and as we were walking there, we passed Cento. When we got to our original destination, there was no one sitting at the restaurant, so we decided to circle back and go to Cento. The place was packed, the environment was entertaining and exciting, and the service was so wonderful and welcoming. We were seated right away at a lovely table! The menu was impressive, every single thing looked amazing. Pictured below. We started out with some cocktails and appetizers. We figured after a long day of work, we could eat a little sinfully. When in Rome. Get the irony? We hadn't eaten any cheese, and we are in Wisconsin so we decided to order the fried mozzarella balls, meatballs, and bacon wrapped dates - all photographed below-for appetizers. We planned on splitting the chicken Parm, our server said the chicken Parmesan is on the menu because it's a classic, but it's not the best tasting. She recommended we order the brick chicken if we were in the mood for chicken. So we did. Such an amazing choice. It was so delicious. This chicken is cooked so wonderfully it almost melted in your mouth, in a good way. It also had a citrus arugula salad which was delicious as well. The perfect combination of hearty and healthy. I knew I really loved the restaurant and ambience because I kept looking around. I also took a photo from where we were sitting. It looked like everybody else was having such a great time and enjoying themselves as well. That's a huge indicator. We order the butterscotch dessert which was heavenly. My colleague got a Macciato which came with a delicious snicker doodle tasting cookie. Yes, we were sinful. Out of everything between the cocktails, appetizers, meal, dessert, and coffee, the bill was only $87. Toto we are not in Los Angeles anymore. For a little over $100, all in, iwas incredible dining experience and I highly recommend it to anyone. Five stars  (not just because I'm Italian)."}
{"text":"Cento turned out to be a mediocre brunch experience, especially on the food front.  The only really good dish among those we tried was the ricotta pancakes with blueberries and lemon curd.  While it was delicious, the three small Swedish style pancakes lost in a large white bowl did not satisfy a modest appetite.  The burrata pizza was okay but did not stand out in any way.  The shaved porchetta sandwich--a 1/2 inch thick slab of pork and fat with little flavor on a baguette with a few greens--was awful.  Shaving implies thin slices or shreds of meat, not a slab.  Very unattractive and unappetizing menu item.
Service and ambience were good.  But Cento's brunch, as currently configured, does not compete favorably with Sardine, Heritage Tavern or Graze to name just a few other brunch spots around downtown."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect--the service, the timeliness, the atmosphere...

...everything EXCEPT THE FOOD.

I can't give a restaurant a good review if the food isn't good, especially at this price point. Here's the run-down:

DRINKS: Okay, these were good. The Mulo Romano and Amore Amaro were probably highlights of the meal.

WARM OLIVES: Fine. These were the highlight of the food, but the texture was a little mushy--not firm and fresh like olives should be. The orange peel garnish added a nice, unexpected element that made the dish more complex. Eat this part with the olives if you decide to order this.

ARANCINI: They were hard balls of bland, puffy, overcooked rice. Looking back on images that other people posted on Yelp of their Cento arancini, the kitchen must have also run out of cheese. Ours came with a light dusting of powdered parm rather than an ample melty layer of shredded cheese as is seen in another photo. 

SOURDOUGH WITH LOCAL BUTTER: They really play with words to make this starter sound romantic. 5 half-slices of bread come with a ball of butter in a little pool of olive oil. The flavors were one-note. It would have been nice to have salt and pepper grinders on the table so we could customize the dish ourselves. I understand that good restaurants don't offer salt and pepper on the table because the chef wants customers to experience each dish as he/she creates it, but everything else we had that night could have used some more seasoning.

FRIED SQUID: Over-fried squid was rubbery. The romesco sauce was good, but it was the only source of flavor on the plate. The grilled lemons would have been a great touch if we were able to squeeze some juice out of the paper-thin slices.

BLACK TAGLIATELLE: The pasta itself had a gluey, pasty texture that wasn't pleasant. I wondered if it was the squid ink, but after doing a little research post-visit, this wasn't the case. Our tagliatelle also didn't have much sauce, and what was there tasted like cream and not much else. Very bland. This was disappointing because so many Yelpers rave about this dish, and their photos show a nice golden sauce. 

After reading so many positive reviews, my man and I had greatly anticipated our visit here. But because the food was so expensive, but not good, we don't care to visit again."}
{"text":"What a great place in Madison!  My son and I were walking when we say Cento, caught the vibe through the window and decided to check it out.  They were slammed with reservations and we would have to wait until 9:30pm for a table, but the bar high tops were first come first serve.  Shoot the bar is the best place in the house anyway.  Lack of a reservation wasn't going to stop us from sampling this place.

We stated with a couple of salads, the Calabrian and the Roasted Brussel Sprout.  First let me say that these salads were \"ginormous\".  They were basically a dinner plate portion, piled high.  We both wondered if we would have room for dinner . . . ya, right.  Both were flavorful and loaded with all the fixin's outlined in the menu.  The Brussel sprouts were cooked perfectLy with great seasoning.  The Calabrian was awesome with just the right amount of dried fruit.

Next came our entrees.  My son had the Slow Cooked Pork Shank.  Let's pause here and take a breath.  The shank was cooked slow and tender, and the bone pulled out as easy as one would expect from a nice and slow cooked pork shank.  It was quite good, but a bit fatty and it could have used a bit more seasoning.  It didn't have that full savory flavor of a good pork shank.   I had the Red Wine Braised Short Ribs.  The sauce was excellent and the pearl onions were just right with that sweet but pronounced flavor.  The short ribs were cooked just right, but again they were a bit fatty.   Would we order either of these entrees again . . . you bet!

Was this a knock the ball out of the part place, \"no\", and thus the reason for 4 stars.  The service and atmosphere were spot on, and a hidden jem to be experienced.  Next time we'll have to try the brunch."}
{"text":"Visited with my wife and another couple recently.  I have eaten at Lombardinos a bit so that was my point of comparison for higher end Italian.

Pros:
  * Service was attentive and competent.
  * Appetizers were pretty good, wrapped dates, beats were both good.
  * Good bread.
  * specialty cocktails were ok.
  * desert was great.

Cons:
  *Of the four of us everyones entree was poor.  Two got the prosciutto wrapped fish special and they were all fishy tasting, not the quality one would expect for the price and generally gross.  I got two pasta half orders and both were not flavorful or memorable.  The fourth was another pasta dish that was equally bland.
  * The whole place put on a lot of airs from the servers to the menu it was all trying to scream IMPORTANT FANCY RESTAURANT.  Unfortunately the food did not stick to that narrative. 

On leaving we all agreed that there were some nice parts but the entrees were such a disappointment and made up such a bulk of the bill that we would probably not go back.  Lombardinos is not perfect, but for the same price I have had many better Italian meals there.  Maybe if you just got appetizers it would be a better time."}
{"text":"I took my fiancee here for her birthday last year, and she raved about it. I was happy she had a great time, but I thought the food was just okay. Maybe because I had high hopes for their pizza from the wood-burning oven. Soggy pizza was not what I expected. The bacon wrapped dates was surprisingly good. If she hassles me enough, maybe we'll come back."}
{"text":"I order take out from here whenever I feel like celebrating any sort of special occasion. I love love love the tagliatelle with pork and haven't tried anything else since. I should definitely expand that, but it's so good! I also highly recommend the fried mozzarella balls. The marinara sauce has a bit of spice or kick to it and it's delicious. I could eat 100 of them!!"}
{"text":"Cento was definitely worth the trip downtown! The restaurant itself is very clean and modern. The bar is small and crowded. But the bathrooms are clean and pretty. It has an upscale feel but wearing jeans and a nice shirt is a-okay! The menu has options for most budgets. The group I went was ordered a little bit of everything to share. 

For starters we ordered the Sourdough Bread with butter, olive oil, salt for $3.00. It was good but I probably wouldn't order it again because we ended up with too much food(such a thing?). We ordered the bacon wrapped dates. I would potentially get these again if someone else really wanted to get them but I would probably try something else on their menu. And we also had the Wine-Poached Beets with balsamic, pistachio-crusted and goat cheese. This was also very good but not a have-to-have for me.

For dinner we ordered the Formaggi Pizza with mozzarella, fontina, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula, fig and balsamic glaze. It had multiple levels of flavors and the pizza was baked perfectly. We also shared the Orecchiette pasta. And a side of the Seared Brussels Sprouts. All of these were also very good and I would order them again! 

For dessert, yes dessert, we shared the Chocolate Salumi which was also tasty. 

Overall I had a really nice experience at Cento. Our waitress was kind and helpful and the view of the Overture Center from the dinning area was magical. 

Tip:  Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"This is my second review in a very short time. My dining experience last night was so outstanding, I had to give a second review. 

We had a group of 16 on a Wednesday night at 7:30. The restaurant was packed and there was a great vibe. 

I must start by stating how completely impressed I was with the staff. The manager greeted our admin, who had made the reservation, by name and expressed how delighted she was that we were there. We had two waitresses covering our table, and they were very professional with their initial introductions, describing the menu and taking care of us all evening.

We ordered a wide variety of items between the 16 of us, probably nearly everything on the menu, and we shared most of it. The wines were excellent. The food was truly outstanding: the meat, the fish, the roasted vegetables - really, everything was flavorful and delicious.

My team is global, with several people working in the London office and the rest of us in Milwaukee. All of us are global travelers and have the opportunity to enjoy amazing dining experiences wherever we go. Everyone raved about the food. At the end of the night, the person with the most sophisticated taste told me he'd had a truly amazing meal and that he'd put Cento up against the best restaurants he's enjoyed in France and Italy. I knew the restaurant was great, but this comment was true validation of what a special place this is, right here in Madison. 

Bravo."}
{"text":"I gave Cento another try but wish I wouldn't have. I was still left wondering what all the hubbub was about. We started with the Burrata and fried squid which I was told was very good although the large pieces of fried jalapeno slices confused me. I can't remember jalapeno peppers ever being used and Italian cooking. The Burrata was presented in a very peculiar fashion. Instead of being in a formed ball shape it was a curdled mass served atop a one and a half by four and a half inch piece of bread that had been saturated with oil and then charred on the grill then topped with radish greens and shavings. The bitter flavor from the bread being burnt overpowered the mild cheese and ruined the taste of the dish. The way it was presented made it impossible to share if you were so inclined to eat it.
The main courses we ordered were:
Pappardelle Ragu which was okay. Although the sauce had a nice flavor the pasta had not been cooked properly and the noodles were all stuck together. They were over cooked and sticky because they seem to not have been stirred while in the boiling water. They were also cooked without any salt in the water making us wish there were salt on the table to compensate for this oversight. Also, I wonder why no cheese was offered to top the pasta dishes.
Agnolotti which was just okay flavor wise. Each piece seemed to be cooked to a different value, some were al dente, some were less cooked then that and some were mushy. The dish was swimming in butter and lacking in flavor.
Pollo was flavorful and served with an arugula salad. The citrus flavors thoroughly penetrated the meat and the chicken was moist and delicious.
Fathers Day Meat Special was comprised of prime rib, pork shoulder, grilled chicken thighs and some sort of sausage and fried potato nuggets and an arugula salad. It was served on a platter swimming with oil. The presentation was not pleasing to the eye and the charred smell of the meats was not pleasing. I requested bread with our meal which seems to confuse our server because she stared at me for an uncomfortably long amount of time before complying. My daughter and I split a 350 mL bottle of wine costing $27 and we purchased a side salad for my son not realizing his meal came with a salad and not understanding why that wasn't brought to our attention by the waitress when he was asking about salads. Again I was not pleased with the waitstaff they weren't rude per se but almost seemed put out and not at all attentive. Sam our waiter in training was very nice, his trainer not so nice. She was even annoyed when I asked for ice in my ice water. Our meal totaled $185 and was not worth it! Don't waste your time, don't waste your money. go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I held off on reviewing until I had a chance to try Cento a third time.

First, the good:

- The setting is awesome. Might be the best designed restaurant setting in Madison.
- The drinks are quite good. It's definitely worth checking out the cocktail menu
- Staff is friendly but not exceptional yet

The not so good; I've tried a few things off the menu over 3 visits (Bacon dates, gnocchi, beef tartare, burrata, beets, porchetta pizza, bucatini carbonara, pork chop, cauliflower) so I think the following thoughts are pretty accurate. In general, the food doesn't measure up to the ambiance or price.

- Gnocchi was overworked/gummy. They were described as \"pillows\" and they definitely didn't come out that way. I mentioned this in passing to our waitress when she asked how everything was and I got the impression that she didn't really put much credence in my feedback.  
- Food was underseasoned across the board. Pizza crust had very little flavor and the bucatini carbonara lacked salt - not sure how that's even possible given the fact that the ingredients include parmigiano and pork cheek (guanciale).
- Pork chop was overcooked (we wanted to try the beef or lamb but both were sold out when we went )

I really hope the food continues to improve and I'm not ready to give up on Cento yet. I still love the setting and will update this review if my next meal justifies it."}
{"text":"My wife and I did the works - shared antipasti, shared salad, pasta/secondi and dessert - all excellent, with manageable portions (the emphasis on huge portions is way overdone in the US in our view). Our server was charming and very attentive, with support from a hostess, runners and a pleasant Manager. It's an elegant space. What was unexpected was the cocktails, way above average. My Old Fashioned was one of the best I've had in years, my wife had a nice Sangiovese, and their house made Limoncello was molto bene. We're from Chicago where there are many world-class restaurants. Cento Madison could hold their own in Chicago."}
{"text":"Fancy fancy! I came here to celebrate my sisters graduation. There were 7 of us and our total bill was $242. Holy crap!

Why don't we start with the appetizers:
1. Bread. It's not complimentary, in fact will cost you $3 
2. Butcher board! I'm a big fan of cheese boards (but their cheese board costs a whopping $25) the butcher board is only $26 dollars and comes with two cheeses and three types of curated meat along with a little bit of honey. It was really good! I recommend this.

Drinks:
1. They have a drink called the Yes Queen... holy crap it's strong (whisky) so if you like your drinks strong... get that one. 
2. There's a bubbly drink served in a wine class with a shaved orange peel that was not too bad 
3. There's a really really good drink called the \"French\" something.. I can't remember but it's fruity and I would get that one again. It's not strong or gross either. 

Entree: 
1. My dad ordered the spaghetti which was huge! This was a dish worth sharing. 
2. I ordered the seafood stew which came with oysters, scallops, octopus, and tomato sauce. I think it would've tasted better with Alfredo sauce. 
3. Risotto was perfect size for one person. It was smooth and creamy and came with some shrimp. I would order this entree again.

Dessert:
There are many options but we had a chocolate cookie type of dessert. It came with three hard small cookies, kind of like a crunchy dry chocolate cookie. There was ice cream served on the side so it was a good combination of crunchy and smooth. 

Pricing:
If you're willing to spend a lot, go here. The food is good but super expensive."}
{"text":"Great Italian food, wonderful decor, seemed very inviting but my experience was definitely not that. I took my girlfriend there after seeing the symphony across the street and was given extremely rude treatment from the server. She not only got our order wrong but refused to make eye contact and tried to spend as little time at our table as possible. I promptly asked for the check and left. I would consider giving Cento another chance as the food definitely lived up to my expectations (in spite of it not being what I ordered)."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great especially the charcuterie board with fresh shaved meats imported from Italy.  We also had the pasta, bacon wrapped dates and cocktails. All were delicious. The Lemon drop martini prepared by Bailey is seriously the best martini that I have ever had anywhere. I've ordered this drink since visiting Cento and miss Bailey's version as no other Martini stacks us to hers. Now for the service. It is wonderful Bailey is a very professional bartender and knows how to make any drink off hand. Fast efficient service, both Bailey and Lauren treated us like family. I look forward to my next visit this coming week."}
{"text":"This fairly new addition to the Madison restaurant scene has delicious menu options. The full bar offers an extensive list of drinks including wine, beer, and cocktails.

Parking can be found within a block at a city parking ramp. It's tucked away in the corner across from the very popular Overture Arts Center and newly renovated Madison Public Library.

The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Food arrives in a timely manner and the atmosphere is lively and exciting. At times, it can be a bit too loud. Booths open up into the main dining room. It is one large room with tables in the middle and booths on either side. The kitchen is open at the far end of the dining area which allows people to enjoy the chefs at work."}
{"text":"Perfect Squid Roast. Probably the best squid I've ever had. The rest was decent fare. Nothing spectacular to comment about. The waitresses were super friendly though and the ambience is nice. Also had the Pork Chops. Not to my preference. Get the pastas!"}
{"text":"I took our family there for a Holiday dinner and overall the experience was mediocre.  The food was very good but the service was pretty bad.  There were several things that happened during the meal that really put me off.  First, we got our wine when we were about 75% finished with our appetizers.  When you order a nice bottle of wine at a fancy restaurant, you have some basic expectations.  

When our food was brought to the table the waiter came by ten minutes later to ask if we wanted pepper.  I was like yeah, and I would love a dash of salt too.  I got a slow-cooked pork shank and it was good but needed a bit of salt to my taste.  There was no salt on the table and none was offered.  

We got coffee with dessert and practically had to beg for a refill.

Every one was nice and, overall, the food was good.  But when you spend $300 on dinner you expect a bit more.  And the things that were lacking were so basic it is a real head-scratcher.

I am guessing I wont be back for a while."}
{"text":"Loved it - first it's a beautiful space and it's appropriate to dress up a bit, so that's pretty rare in Madison. Also the food and presentation is top notch. We tried a couple of appetizers, a couple pasta dishes, split an entree and two desserts... Add three cocktails and your at $65 per person including tip, but the food was great. In particular they have a fish, deboned and wrapped in prosciutto that I'm voting the best fish dish in town!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our valentine's day dinner. It was both our first time and our waiter was genuinely the nicest girl I have ever met.

The interior is beautiful! Very simple and elegant. It's a great place for dates or dinner/lunch dates with friends. It's actually a lot bigger than it looks from the outside! There's two sections to the restaurant. One thing that was \"eh\" for me was
our table. My boyfriend made a reservation like two weeks in advance and they gave us kind of a sucky table. The table was small and there was no where to put my purse besides the ground. Also it was kind of crammed in between two other tables. We looked around and there were booths and better table available so that kind of irked me.

Other than that the food was great! We both got pastas! My boyfriend got the seafood pasta and I got the braised beef. They were both delicious! Pastas are from $14-$16 which isn't too bad! 

I also got their limoncello and mannn it is STRONG! I've had limoncello from other restaurants in chicago and san fran. but this one by far packed a punch. It is really sweet but it also stings cause it's that strong! 
For dessert I got their Affogato (they use collectivo espresso!) and it was amazing!! Such a huge fan of it! Not too sweet and not too bitter!

Overall great dinner date experience! I'm a fan! Hopefully we get a better seat next time!
Hope you guys like it too :)!!"}
{"text":"The guy standing at the front is the most rude and unprofessional i have met at a restaurant in Madison. He was acting as if he was paying me to come in and dine at the restaurant. Wish i knew his name. Literally had to walk away because of his rudeness. Senior management, please take note and fix it."}
{"text":"If not ambience of the place I'd give it 2 stars. We both had unfortunately I  unpleasant experience with fish dishes that tasted not fresh and not good. I wouldn't have high expectations for dinner here. 
The service was pretty good maybe a little too often checked on us while we were chewing our food. (About 20 rimes different people for 1,5 hours we have been there)."}
{"text":"Meh, I really like the food. So the food I give 5 stars. Just the ambiance is a little too corporate or something, Ok so the wood fired oven is awesome! Arancini scrumptious. Fried risotto balls. I really love the chef and don't even know who he or she is, Prosciutto and melon is pretty standard at an upscale Italian joint but man oh man was that prosciutto buttery and melon juicy fresh. Lamb ribeye a hit. Pork chop a hit- please order this medium and the lamb med rare. Why am I giving Cento 3 stars???? I'm not. I just can't do that to the chef. I'm giving it 4 stars. but still a 6.... well 10 stars for the food. Place just seemed so stiff for service and the atmosphere too corporate or something. Seemed like our server wanted to hang himself and everyone was a robot. We really enjoyed our food ut couldn't wait to leave and get drinks elsewhere. Atmosphere reminded us of a cold corporate law office or something. Maybe it was just a bad night or off night."}
{"text":"A short walk up Madison's State Street, on a nice winter's day, had it's just reward when we entered the airy and minimalist decor of Cento. We had a light and lively lunch that satisfied our discerning palate and the excited our aesthetic sensibilities. The server and attendant staff were prim, proper and friendly to a fault and helped guide us first timers to the right brunch offerings. The bacon-wrapped dates were a robust revelation, while the Prazo and Prizze selections were sensational! The Ricotta Cheesecake was sinfully delicious."}
{"text":"Another wonderful dinner at Cento!  Thank you Chef Michael Pruett and staff for your wonderful treatment and delicious dinner. The Swordfish was excellent as were the arancini and bacon wrapped dates. We were delighted that our server suggested the Lemon and Strawberry Sorbet and told us she would mix the flavors with two of each flavor. The dessert arrived with 2 strawberry and one lemon. She apologized and as we dug in, she brought another scoop of lemon on the house!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch was wonderful!  My husband enjoyed his pork Benedict and I loved my omelet. We can't wait to go back and try dinner!"}
{"text":"Grandiose atmosphere with gorgeous views of the Overture Center. Tried the warm marinated olives which were amazing, and the lasagne alla bolognese which was to die for. Incredible ambiance and delicious food!"}
{"text":"cento has amazing food and the staff is all so wonderful from time you walk in until the time you leave :-)"}
{"text":"My experience at Cento was fine, but I wasn't wowed. We were heading to an event across the street at the Overture Center, so scheduling dinner reservations at Cento made sense.

Our server was very friendly, personable and attentive. Whoever the other server was who delivered our appetizer and entrees seemed pretty grumpy.

We tried the fried artichokes for an appetizer. I'd never eaten anything like them before, and I thought they were quite delicious, but I felt that they needed more sauce. My seafood risotto was pretty good -- the risotto itself was wonderfully creamy. I found some of the calamari pieces in the risotto, though, to be quite chewy and rubbery. 

The tiramisu for dessert was wonderful. But I don't think I've ever had \"bad\" tiramisu! For the price, though, we received an incredibly small portion of dessert.

Some restaurants in Madison exceed my expectations every time I visit; Cento didn't do that for me. While I thought my food was tasty and I had a nice time at Cento, I didn't find anything to be incredible, in my opinion.

For what we paid, I should really be wowed."}
{"text":"Not enough great things to say about the service and the food. The mussels were on point as well as the octopus for starters. Pork pappardelle and prosciutto pizza were equally magnificent. Great meal. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Sadly I couldn't eat all the food I ordered during my dinner at Cento - sad because it was so good that I wish I had room for.just.one.more.bite. Alas, I didn't. However, all the bites I did have resulted in a very happy tummy on my end. And if you'd like to replicate that feeling, here are the things I ordered (not by myself, geesh, it was a sharing table y'all):

+ bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with spicy sausage and piquillo pepper sauce
+ arancini with spicy tomato sauce
+ sourdough bread with local butter, olive oil and salt
+ burrata and olio verde on rustic bread
+ brussels sprouts, apple and bacon
+ roasted cauliflower with country ham
+ fingerling potatoes with garlic and cipollini onions

Although this entire dinner was made of sides and starters, or what Cento calls \"spuntini,\" \"antipasti,\" and \"contorni,\" it was way more than enough food for our table so I think you can order from their menu willy-nilly and be totally satisfied.

The service and atmosphere are both lovely and I'd be happy to eat dinner here again."}
{"text":"Honestly, good reviews are a little boring. People like hearing about dining disasters - rude and incompetent staff, food inedible, a hole in the wall decor.. and you wont find any of that here. Sorry! 

I can't express enough praise for Cento. Had a reservation for four at 8pm, and that was met timely, despite the restaurant being extremely busy. Had a wine concierge explain to us some of their many, many wines and how fancy is that? Also had a waitress that knew the menu in and out like nobody's business. She gave great recommendations, and even persuaded us to try some items we might have second glanced.

My party enjoyed the fried squid and bacon wrapped dates as an appetizer, and both were out of this world. The dates are stuffed with this spicy, but not too spicy, sausage and lathered with piquillo pepper sauce, which makes for a sweet and savory appetizer, with all the flavors complimenting one another extremely well. One friend got the sweet italian sausage pizza as an entree and it was plenty big for one person. Another friend had the pollo al mattone, and it's probably the best chicken I've ever had. It was seasoned and grilled to perfection; drizzled with lemon and I was in heaven. There wasn't a single dish we all shared that was anything less than five stars. After our late night supper, my friends and I unanimously agreed that Cento was nothing short of magnificent, and we'd be back very soon."}
{"text":"The food and service here is wonderful. I asked my server which pasta dishes would be good with truffle. She returned and said that the chef would create a dish for me that's off the menu. I agreed and so glad that I did. It truly was the best pasta dish I've ever ate and I'm a big foodie, traveled in Italy and take clients out to dinners all the time. If I ever come back to Madison, this is the first restaurant I would go to. The pasta was freshly made, everything we ordered was amazing and the wine selection was great. The owner even stopped at our table to say hello. This place is a must try!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here on Saturday night and we were pleasantly surprised. the menu is rather limited, but we enjoyed our food. I started with a spinach, blue cheese salad that was fresh and tasty. My husband had the bacon wrapped dates and loved the mix of sweet and salty. For entrees, I had the seafood risotto, which was perfectly cooked and my husband, who is a pizza fanatic, loved his margherita pizza. service was excellent. My only complaint is that it is very noisy and difficult to carry on an intimate conversation."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner here tonight with my husband and came away really impressed. I had the orecchiette, which had wilted spinach and stewed tomatoes and Italian sausage - SO GOOD. I also ordered a side of fingerling potatoes because I just can't resist them. It was a huge serving and very tasty but most of it got boxed up as I focused on my pasta. We shared two appetizers - sourdough bread as well as fried mozzarella. Both were great, but I probably wouldn't order the fried mozzarella again as it's not too different from cheese curds you can get anywhere in town. That sourdough though. Only $3 and absolutely perfect in taste and portion. 

I was a little disappointed that moscato was only available by bottle, not glass, and instead I had a vodka lemonade, which was okay but a little too watery. 

To top it all off I got a free dessert thanks to my birthday. We shared the vanilla buneto (sp??) which was again okay but not amazing. 

I would absolutely love to come back, either for another special occasion meal or maybe for happy hour. Server was very attentive and sweet; atmosphere was chic but cozy. Our bill came to just about $100 before tip and included 2 cocktails, 2 appetizers, 1 pasta and 1 chicken entree, and 2 sides."}
{"text":"As H voted to come and try this new restaurant, I was ready to bet we would be severely disappointed. After all Italian food I have really high standards for Italian food and some of the pics I saw of the dishes made me worry this might be the kind of over-sauced Italian I hate. I couldn't be farther from the truth.

I really enjoyed all the food there. I had the small ricotta gnocchi (which was not all that small) and H had the small black fetuccini with seafood. I tried the fetuccini and I liked them, but I think the gnocchi where much better. The mushroom and cheese sauce well complemented the gnocchi without weighting them down too much.

After that we shared the Arctic char. The fish itself was perfect. Skin was crispy and fish was cooked to perfection. The vegetables, were good but a bit oily for my taste. Flavor was there and cooking was pretty much spot on, but I would have drained most of the oil they had been cooked in before plating them.

After the fish I was pretty much full, but BF opted for dessert and chose the berry sorbet. It was OK a bit sweet for my taste and not all that special according to me, but he liked it. For $7 I would have skipped it (It was worth about $3-5 to me).

Service, location and wine were good and well complemented the food. If I have to criticize something I would say the room was a bit dark and pretty cold.

Will enter the rotation of spendy restaurants that deserve my money on special occasions."}
{"text":"I came here with a co-worker after work on a Monday around 6pm with no reservation. The inside was nice, I would describe it as a pretty modern trendy type of feel / vibe. As our dinner went on the place also got fairly busy, which was surprising for a Monday. 

In terms of food we split 3 of the small plates. The beef tartare was FANTASTIC.  I eat a lot of tartare and this was very good. We also got the sourdough bread, which I liked with their olive oil/butter combination.  The last thing we got to start was fried mozzarella, which was tasty and the sauce had a nice little kick to it. For my entree I had the Casarecce, which was good but didn't blow me away. My friend had the Pappardelle, which I slightly preferred over mine because her sauce was great. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend and would return."}
{"text":"I have been here before and always had complaints about Cento but they have finally found their grove and is an excellent place to dine. The service is very competent to go along with the food. They get the job done without the annoying \"how is everything tasting\" every twenty minutes. Our waiter was there when we needed him and not when we didn't. Perfect.His name rhymed with red if you get him. If you have never had mussels get them here as a hot appetizer. It will set you back fifteen dollars but OMG! They are in a red sauce with crumbled Italian sausages and a piece of grilled bread to dip with. It was fantastic. The meat prices are high here but the pasta and other dishes are less twenty to thirty dollars. drinks are reasonable too. Look the menu over before going and give it a shot. The Halibut was yummie and I had the wild bore in a pasta shell. As good as it gets and no hair! A little joke."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner! Don't be afraid to try new things on this menu, it will not disappoint! Bacon wrapped dates are delish...wood fired pizza is amazing...and ask for wine samples! Yum!"}
{"text":"The interior lighting is five stars.  Seating is comfortable and the wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The food is good. It is not a good value.  Like many State Street high end eateries, parents of students, expense account warriors and others making funny money will tend to flock here. Italian fare should not be this expensive. Beware everything is Ala carte.  I ordered the sourdough  bread as a side to accompany my pasta dish. Everyone at our table thought it was complementary with the meal and helped themselves to it. Oh how I pine for the days of a Macaroni Grill where great bread is free and it is considered bad luck to cut it so breaking reigns. The drinks here are creative and small too. Glad I saw this place but I would rather seek a better value venue."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Saturday and cannot recommend it enough. $25 for a pastry, 2 cocktails, coffee, and an entree is an amazing brunch deal. Seriously, come here and get the boozy brunch offer before anyone wises up and takes it off the menu because it is too good to be true.

I ordered the seasonal omelet for my entree and it was actual fluffy perfection. The croissant, jam, and cocktails were all incredibly delicious. Honestly, I have no criticism to offer. My experience at Cento was pretty close to perfect.

Not to mention, Chef Giovanni is kind of a babe and will probably become your new food crush. 

Get ready for Cento to be your new brunch obsession."}
{"text":"Worse kitchen service ever. Arrived @ 5pm theater@ 7:30. Entries no show. Never going back."}
{"text":"Magnifico!! The first of the Italian Regional Dinner Series at Cento was absolutely fantastic. This January dinner was perfect for a cold winter evening with the recipes coming from the snowy, mountainous region of Italy near Austria, the Alto Adige. Every course was paired with a wine of the area - Perfectly.
Amuse - a small plate with speck and kale to get our palates ready and in the mood for.....

First- Spinach canederli with creamy cheese sauce. These were sort of a spinach pan-fried dumpling, but super light and crispy. Gorgeous presentation here and at every course. With a yummy Pinot Grigio.

Second- A housemade wurst with a great mustard sauce and a few sprigs of sauerkraut. The snappiness of the wurst with the snap of the whole mustard seeds was lovely. With a pinot noir.

Third - a Trentino (beef) goulash on rich and creamy polenta; an excellent winter hearty dish. with a \"Langrein\" - a red wine- (a new grape for me). 

Dessert knocked our wool socks off! Apfelstrudel - the best I have ever tasted - a flaky pastry ring around apples and dried fruit, served with a scoop of vanilla gelato. With a sweet wine that was SO GOOD - incredible layers of flavor in this Gewurztraminer, honey, apricot, vanilla.... and I do not usually like sweet wines at all.

Grazie to Chef Michael Pruett and his team who were there all evening to explain the wines and food origins and answer questions. Lovely lovely dinner in the beautiful Cento banquet room. Wonderful service and - it bears repeating - stunning presentations."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday gathering recently. The service was excellent, the employees were all friendly, welcoming, and attentive. We ordered drinks, appetizers, and mains, so it got pricy quickly! Again, it is just off capitol square in Madison, so this was expected. If you're looking for upscale and fancy, this is the place! But call at least a couple days in advance, I would say! We couldn't get reservations, but we were able to score a place in the bar because we showed up at opening with our small group, and ended up eating at the tables there. The mains portion sizes were large (not super tiny, as happens when the restaurant gets too upscale...) so you get what you pay for, which is a delicious, Italian meal in a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"The owner of the restaurant contacted me shortly after I posted my first review apologizing for the experience and offering a gift certificate. He noted that improvements were actively being made to the food and service quality and the restaurant would change the temperature of the dining area upon request. Not many restaurant owners respond to reviews, especially negative ones, so it's impressive that the owner cared enough to respond in a professional and timely manner. Cento is still a relatively new Madison restaurant and appears to be constantly evolving and improving. Certainly worth another look."}
{"text":"A good solid fine dining option, especially before or after some fine theater! They have great happy hour specials and amazing traditional Italian cocktails at reasonable prices. Really fantastic bruschetta. Main dishes are quite good, but small and somewhat overpriced. If the portions were larger or the entree prices were a little lower, I'd give it 5 stars. A+ service and decor."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday night.  The ambiance of this place is great.  It's a little more formal, but not so much so that you feel under dressed or out of place.  The food was excellent.  The bacon wrapped dates were out of this world.  Overall I think this is going to be a new go-to spot for me."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite birthday dinner to date. Walking in this place, you can sense it's a wee bit different than the usual Italian fare around Madison. Dressy? Yes, please. 

My fianc√© took me here for a birthday dinner after we've been driving past it the last couple of months. We thought, why not? So we got dressed and headed here for some Italian. 

We started off with the bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with spicy sausage and piquillo pepper sauce after reading other Yelpers' reviews. Small, but tasty! There's literally like a burst of flavor once you bite into it. I expected it to be really just a bacon flavor, but I was wrong. The sweet and salty was a perfect combination in this little plate. The piquillo pepper sauce would've made for some good bread dip also. 

They were out of gnocchi tonight (?!?!?!?) and it almost felt like it was meant to be. I LOVE gnocchi and always seem to steer towards that dish at any restaurant, so it forced me to try something else. First world problems over here.

We opted for the smaller versions of two pastas: 1) agnolotti with pumpkin, sage, walnuts and parmigiano reggiano and 2) black tagliatelle with lobster, prawn, mussels, lobster sauce and fresh horseradish. The agnolotti was so soft and the parmigiano reggiano wasn't as strong as I've experienced. I was hoping for more pumpkin because that actually was my favorite part of the dish. Go figure. The black tagliatelle dish (aka squid ink pasta, y'all) was oh-my-gee seafood heaven! My fianc√© wasn't a fan of it because it was too fishy for him, but this Filipino girl felt at home. It was a very rich dish--that lobster sauce was very creamy. Overall, the pasta dishes were no disappointment. It's definitely worth it to get 2 or 3 of the smaller pasta dishes to be able to try them all out. Or that could just be me.

We also got a pizza (sweet italian sausage, bocconcini, broccoli rapini, tomato sauce, garlic and chili flake)--very thin, not too crunchy, but very good. It wasn't out of this world, but it was a good introduction to their pizza selections. My fianc√©'s main dish was the pollo al mattone with salsa verde, arugula and lemon--the chicken just looked so pretty with the skin roasted into a perfect brown (I felt weird typing that?) and the arugula was a good balance to the simple flavoring of the chicken. 

My birthday dessert was the the cherry chocolate truffle cake with gelato--LOVE. The fianc√© isn't a huge dessert person but he really enjoyed this and actually ate more of it than I did. The cherry was a good choice too--I was weary at first but it really made the dish. 

Overall, a very satisfying dinner. The service was great (oh! Chanel/Shanell? was our sweet server) and I was greeted happy birthday several times. Felt pretty special! So glad this place exists."}
{"text":"Slooooowwwwww service, good but not great for the price of food. My pork chop was poorly seasoned, but my wife's dish was good. Meatballs were bland and lacked soul."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Came here for Saturday brunch and had the Salami Hash. Highly recommend. Excited to go back and try more things!"}
{"text":"Now here's a place to become a regular. What a wonderful addition to Madison's already delicious litany of downtown restaurants with good ambiance and great food. The atmosphere is perfect -- open and sleek, but not austere, with a substantial bar area. The service is excellent as well, with attentive but not overbearing waiters and waitresses who actually seem knowledgeable about both the cocktail and food menu. But the easiest thing to rave about with Cento is (luckily) the food. Dishes are made with great ingredients, prepared well, and matched with good flavors. Appetizers are often much bigger than anticipated (e.g., the charcuterie board is more like like a charcuterie table), so they can easily be mixed and matched to serve as a meal. Pastas are perfectly cooked and made (especially the gnocchi), and cocktails are inventive and delicious (most interestingly mix bourbon and Italian spirits, like aperol). Prices are slightly higher than is desirable, but the portions and quality of ingredients sort of justify them. 

I've been twice now, and am looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"After checking out Cento on it's opening night, I can say for certain that I will be heading back there for other meals. I can tell that Food Fight and chef Michael Pruett were meticulous when choosing the location and designing the space and menu for this new Italian restaurant.

I will say that it has to be one of the most aesthetically pleasing spaces i've seen in a restaurant. Everything inside it looks brand spanking new, or it's super old to the point where it's charming. There's really too many facets about it to list, and the people there can describe it better than I can, so i'd recommend checking the space out for yourself to witness it. It's just gorgeous.

All of the food that I tasted that night was spot on. Among them included the Arancini (which are fried Risotto balls), which was a goodie because it managed to satisfy my impulse for fried things without tasting greasy at all. The ricotta-filled agnolotti was also good, although more mild/subtle on its flavors. The fennel was an excellent side dish to go along with the agnolotti. Finally, for dessert we all split a slice of what was dubbed an olive oil cake, and that was delectable. Also, note that the cocktails are well worth a go, particularly the Mulo Romano. That was a very flavorful drink, and i'm excited to have another one of those soon.

Much like the setting, the service we received on opening night was also stellar. Our server Alex had an extensive knowledge of the menu, which was useful for us, as the menu isn't the easiest to read through for people not used to it. Everyone was accommodating, polite, and the orders all came out timely. I couldn't really ask for anything better.

The only thing Cento disappointed me on was the portion sizes, which I felt were a bit small. This could just be because I was famished entering the place that day, and i'm a man with a gigantic appetite. So, others maybe won't find this to be a problem. Besides that, I felt like Cento nailed all of the aspects of a dining experience, which is no easy task!"}
{"text":"The food as well as the service was absolutely fantastic. This was our first time here, and we already made a reservation for later tonight."}
{"text":"Yet another food fight restaurant...however this one is decidedly upscale-perfect for a date night or an evening at the Overture.  Great steaks, Italian dishes (though the gnocchi I had was a little undercook--no big deal and it certainly was fresh).  Good drinks as well--definitely recommend the limoncello.  I haven't been in a while, but I definitely want to go back.  

Park in the Overture Ramp.  

It is definitely a place you should get dressed up for: it is not uber casual like many of Madison's restaurants.  

Great photography on the walls too--take a chance to wander around while you look for the bathroom."}
{"text":"We came for a large dinner party, and they had the back area set up with two long tables, which was really nice. This room also had its own bar, so we were able to stay in one area the entire time. However, the biggest negative about this room is that it is LOUD- there is nothing to absorb any sound in there, and you felt like you had to keep talking louder and louder for people to hear you. Aside from the noise, we had a four course set menu for dinner, and got to try:

-Wine Poached Beets, Balsamic, Pistachio Crusted Goat Cheese (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_TKKptLTxqvrqhTllNwoIg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- the beets were poached perfectly and went really well with the goat cheese. However, the wine and balsamic pairing made the overall dish a bit too acidic for me, but the goat cheese helped to offset some of that.
-Margherita Pizza (Basil, Roasted Cherry Tomato, Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=eqgMv5SpIaFrjfyQQ08KQw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The tomato sauce was delicious, as were the roasted cherry tomatoes. However, as always with Margherita pizzas, it could have used more mozzarella and basil for my tastes. The crust was solid though, and I would order this again.
-Spicy Salumi Pizza (Soppressata, Mozzarella, Basil, Tomato Sauce): Pretty good, but I actually liked the margherita more for it's simplicity. 
-Orecchiette, Italian Sausage, Spinach, Tomato, Pecorino: Yum- the oreccheitte tasted really fresh and was perfectly al dente. I loved the bite from the pasta and the combination of ingredients- highly recommended!
-Tagliatelle, Ragu Lala Bolognese, Ricotta, Parmesan: Also very good, but I liked the orecchiette a bit more. However, the tagliatelle also tasted super fresh, and the ragu and ricotta were a good combination- recommended!
-Cherry Chocolate Truffle Cake w/Cherry Gelato (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=G-mSxm5E4a5PyqVvYEKq3A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): This was the only dish that night I didn't like- the cake had a strange consistency (not quite brownie like not quite cake like) and was very dense. I'm also not a big fan of cherry flavors, so didn't like the gelato at all- skip!

The service was a bit slow since we had such a large party, and there were some long gaps in between the different dishes; however, overall they did a good job. It was also a bit difficult at times to pass the pastas and pizzas since it was served family style instead of individual plates, and not everyone got to sample everything, which could be a bit disappointing. The food itself though, was mostly delicious, and I would definitely come back here and also recommend it for any Italian food lovers. Parking can be difficult on a Friday night, but we were able to find street parking a couple blocks away. There are also some parking structures available."}
{"text":"I was leaning toward 4 stars but the very marginal $60 rib eye dropped the whole experience down a notch.  We were at Cento last night for my husbands birthday.  It was our first time here and immediate impressions were positive- it was crowded, bustling, and we grabbed a great high top table in back by the window.  

Our server was very attentive but did not seem to be very knowledgeable about the attributes of various dishes, recommendations, explanations, etc.  

We started with the butcher board and arancini.  Both were very good and good sized appetizers for the prices.  Although, there were 3 meats on the butcher board which were basically 3 varieties of ham- would have been nice to mix it up.

For entrees, I got the boar ragu conchiglioni and my husband decided to splurge on the rib eye because it was his celebration.  My pasta was excellent- the boar ragu had an orange zest accent that balanced the flavors perfectly!  The rib eye on the other hand came with a field of greens that looked like nothing but a space filler because the rib eye itself wasn't even very big- and my husband isn't a huge eater- especially after the appetizer course!  He also mentioned offhandedly that it smelled like a foot (could have been the herbed butter?) for some strange reason- this made it somewhat unappetizing!!  The meat was decent but he was not overwhelmed by his meal at all- especially for the price tag.

We finished with the chocolate crunch cake....the menu doesn't mention the molten-y center though- and it wasn't our favorite- very reminiscent of a chain restaurant dessert.  The 2 tastes of gelato that came with it were very good.

Lastly, our server brought the check before we had asked and before we had finished dessert.  This was not a pleasant way to end when it feels like you're being tossed out.  Not classy, Cento!

Overall, we will likely be back- but it will be to sit at the bar, drink some wine, and share some pastas."}
{"text":"I gave Cento another try and am I glad I did.  We first went in November and were disappointed by the food and the service.  What a difference a few months make! Our appetizers were delicious (try the melon and proscuitto) and everyone was very pleased with their entrees.  Our server was excellent: she made sure we made our play at the Overture while also presenting our birthday girl with a complimentary dessert.  We loved it and we will be back!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 12.
Wine selection was great.   Even among single glass selections it was great.   We had two Italian whites that were outstanding.  One of the two was spectacular.
I had two appetizers:   Squid and octopus.    Their lightly breaded squid was much better than usual.   Their octopus was quite tender;   The proferred steak knife was not needed.
Service was halting.  Food tastes weren't memorable.   Neither were up to their price.   So, call it a four."}
{"text":"We have dined here many times.  Last night was not good.  Hardly any butter with the bread this time.  Extremely weak drinks this time (any booze in there?).   Entrees were fine.   Even though it was later in the evening (8:30), we felt rushed.  Couldn't wait to get out of the loud army mess hall din and go elsewhere for dessert. (And fix the lights above the booths!  Three weeks ago, one wasn't working.  Last night, two weren't working.  Replace the bulbs or call an electrician, for Pete's sake.)"}
{"text":"I've now enjoyed dinner, lunch, and (finally! What took me so long!) brunch here, and I'd say Cento is a triple-crown winner.  The menu is upscale Italian, but very approachable, with a lot of variety for different tastes and appetites.  

Brunch menu has something for everyone, daily market quiche, seasonal omelet, and a nice range of savory and sweet choices.  We just ate there with a group of 9 and everyone came away full and very, very pleased.  Happily, they've kept their fantastic burger on the brunch menu.  Back when they were serving weekday lunch, this was one of Madison's culinary gems.  

The Boozy Brunch is a special treat with the pastry of the day, choice of entree, any two brunch cocktails, and all the Colecitivo coffee you need to balance out the drinks, for $25.  

Cento is a lovely dinner spot for date night or for a group.  They also have an excellent semi-private area for events.  They have a fantastic wine list to complement the food, and delicious, creative cocktails.  I also highly recommend the vermouth on tap!"}
{"text":"Traveling from Los Angeles, we were looking for a good restaurant and Cento did not disappoint. 
Butcher Board appetizer was SO good, very tasty and I was very impressed they were serving local Wisconsin cheese. We also ordered a pizze (super tasty and loved the wood fire oven taste), the roasted cauliflower with country ham (AMAZING!) and the roasted pollo with salsa verde. All of the food was very, very good. The service was fantastic - we arrived before the dinner rush and when we sent back a room-temp Pelligrino they happily replaced it with a cold bottle for free. 
The restroom was very clean, ambiance very nice and pleasant, not too loud and overall one of the best dining experiences in Madison for out-of-towners."}
{"text":"Short and Sweet....Great service...Beautiful inside..Overpriced and not worth the money..."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim with friends and were lucky enough to nab a table on a Friday night. The service was friendly and attentive and the menu eclectic with decent choices. We always judge Italian places tough because they are usually so far from the realities of what is Italian food.

We started with the Octopus appetiser which was wonderful. In totally non-American fashion it is not deep-fried and served with marinara sauce (although they have traditional American Calamari served in this fashion), but instead chickpeas and chorizo. It was a unique taste on a Southern Italian dish and we enjoyed it immensely. 

For main courses we did risotto and pasta and both were very tasty. The drink menu includes staples of Italian beer, liqueur, and wine. 

The key though is that for 3 people (4th just drinking a few beers) we walked out the door for around 125 USD. Considering the quality of the meal and diverse options we were pleasently surprised. We will be back."}
{"text":"One of Americas best new chefs, Michael Pruett, teamed with Sommelier Caitlin Suemnicht have succeeded in creating a great menu and wine list to satisfy the most discerning customer.  

We dined there for dinner trying something from almost every category and were very pleased. We selected an incredible bottle of wine from their list - 2008 Il Fauno di Arcanum, a 94 pt wine with a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Sangiovese and Petit Verdot. It was velvety smooth and delicious. Loved the food, with the prize going to their Black Tagliatelle with lobster, prawns, clams, mussels, peas, uni sauce and fresh horseradish.  It is the kind of food you dream about later!

The service was great and the restaurant design is very pleasing.  A great new find in Madison."}
{"text":"Cento, your style is COOL --dark, mysterious, mod and clean-cut. But the taste of your food doesn't quite live up to the look! We tried the much-talked-about bacon-wrapped dates and butcher's board for starters, and both were goooood, but neither had my eyes bugging out! My dad's braciole was delicious, but he said it wasn't cooked quite right (I've never had real braciole before, but I trust my Italian dad in judging its authenticity). My mom's Arctic char was good, and so was my friends' chicken parm. I had the Chittara pasta (mussels, shrimp, squid, onion, tomato, horseradish) and it didn't even have mussels! (HA, the dish wasn't very strong!) They replaced them with chewy calamari without even telling me. All the fish was average, but at least the sauce was tart and delicious. Dessert was good; I'd definitely recommend the butterscotch budino. The ricotta cheesecake was very nice and the lemon sorbet served with it was dreamy, but we all agreed they didn't go well together. I feel like a huge downer giving such a cool place such critique, so I'm giving 4 stars! Oh and hey, the bathroom was gorg ;)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how long this restaurant has been in Madison, but this will be our go-to place for Italian when we visit. They were very welcoming to us and our 5-year old. They don't have a separate kids' menu, but when I asked about a kids' portion of spaghetti, the server said of course. It was very good. 

The Neapolitan style pizza was also excellent all around. 

The entrees we ordered were uniquely prepared and I could eat them every day. The gnocchi with herbs was very flavorful and light. My shrimp scampi entree was amazing. Three huge shrimp with perfectly cooked pasta in a lemony sauce that I could eat all by itself. 

Our server was great, food was great as well as a great atmosphere!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good but not amazing. We all had pasta dishes. They were perfectly done and very tasty. Appetizers were not the best. I also had a War Man martini. It ws really interesting and different. Exceptionally nice wait staff. I really appreciate that the manager came over and checked on us. I wish I could give it five stars because they were so nice. It was really good but I would not call it amazing."}
{"text":"Love the pasta & meat & cheese boards here. Last visit the service wasn't up to par, but that's an exception here."}
{"text":"I ate here before attending an event at the Overture Center. I'm from out of town and don't get to Madison very often, so I relied on reviews to help me pick my restaurant. The positive comments from other diners were all spot on. The food was great, the service was awesome, and the specialty drinks were really flavorful. I'll be back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Omg, this place was amazing.  We unfortunately did not have reservations but were able to order food at the bar.  The food was amazing, my only complaint being that the bartender gave the girls next to us bread before their meal and neglected to do that for us.  It certainly looked like it would taste good.  The Ahi tuna tartare was perfect, they were out of the squid I so desperately wanted to try, but the bartender recommended the Speck pizza instead and I am glad he did.  My wife enjoyed the Garganelli so much that she asked for one to go so that she could take it to work.  Our final dish was the Chocolate Bread Pudding that was warm and amazing.  Overall a great experience even if we did feel a bit slighted in the beginning."}
{"text":"What I love most about Cento is the space. It is a very open dining room, with a view of the kitchen and a beautiful bar. Beyond the atmosphere, the service is wonderful, attentive, and happy to make suggestions. 

I ordered the porcetta pizza, which was delicious but was no match for the squash pasta my tablemate ordered. I love that you can order small plates of pasta so that the table can share a range of options. It is so hard to choose between their dishes and the half portion makes this decision a little bit more bearable!"}
{"text":"I felt so out of place here because the service was so professional and well done. I rarely get treated this well at a restaurant, so definitely a plus!

Food was fantastic! I got the Risotto and it was well made, and not too heavy like most Risotto is. Their drink menu is also interesting. My fiance got a drink with a hint of cardamom and it was...awesome. Bitter and perfect.

The only thing is that this place can get a bit pricey if you get the high-end stuff. If you stick to the pasta, it'll be affordable. Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Bar seating is first come, first serve! This is your best bet for a weekend dinner with no reservation (and with an event at the overture). Food was well prepared and great presentation.

Beef Tartare - so delish! Presentation was beautiful,  every element of the dish worked so well together. No complaints except I wanted more!

Lamb - generous portion and lamb fell off the bone, super juicy and tender. Our piece was kind of fatty but still perfectly cooked. The saffron risotto could taste more saffron-y, but still creamy and delicious. Eating this dish made us crave for some greens though. 

Pappardelle - noodles cooked perfect!!! The sauce was not my favorite, a little bland, but probably just my taste. The prosciutto was a little too thick and not marble-y enough (too meaty ). I will definitely come back to try more pasta dishes, especially the bucatini and tagliatelle!

Really love the decor of the place and lighting is a perfect dim. Even at the bar and it being full, service was good. It's easy to see the chefs here know how to cook - will be back!!"}
{"text":"Have only been here for brunch- but multiple times & it is hands down my favorite brunch spot in Madison. Beautiful place, friendly staff, and great food & drink. The bonus is that you can make reservations which is always nice! Their breakfast pizza is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I will start with the good.  Our waitress was friendly and did a good job.  She did seem to lack any knowledge of the restaurant's moderately sized liquor choices so we were in the dark about those with which we were not already familiar.

Now the numerous reasons for the one star.  We have tried Cento twice due to its convenience to the Overture center.  I expect a restaurant in Cento's price range to have some talent in the kitchen.  Last night all four of us were disappointed.  My wife had the pork chop and was totally unimpressed.  I had the chicken parmesan which was described as having a spicy sauce.  It was perhaps the most bland dish I have ever eaten.  Our teenagers both had lasagna which was on par with freezer lasagna from the grocery store.  

Other details- the salads were OK.  Two of three desserts were very good but I would again argue that a restaurant in Cento's category should be able to amaze with every dessert on the menu.  

The strangest detail of all was the martinis my wife and I had.  When the waitress was unable to tell us anything about the specialty gins on the menu we each went with something standard that we knew well.  One Hendricks and one Deaths Door.  These are distinctly different gins.  Our martinis tasted very similar with a putrid common flavor.  We were unable to identify it but it ruined the drinks.  

In summation, there are many better options on State Street and the square.  We will not be back to Cento.  I am perplexed by the good ratings they get.  I have a theory that some people cannot give a low rating to a restaurant once they have spent a lot of money.  This may apply to Cento."}
{"text":"Came with a large party...  first mistake...as they split us up across the room from each other..  gave us a NOVICE waitress she was sweet just very slow ...Saw our drinks sitting at the bar getting warm for over 15 min!!  Went and asked for the manager said she might need some help!  Got a little  better service after that ... but don't see our company going back as the food was just OK! To many Great places in Madison that would be happy to have business!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best food I've had in while. Cento is located downtown Madison, across the street from the Overture. Seating is limited so I would recommend making reservations ahead of time. Even though there was a slight mishap during our dining experience I still give it 5 stars.

A girlfriend and I stopped for dinner before attending a show. We tried making reservations the same day with no luck so we risked showing up without one. Luckily we beat the rush because there are a handful of high top tables that are first come first serve. 

We both ordered a specialty cocktail, bread, and our entr√©e's. The pear mules were a special that part of the price goes towards Second Harvest, and they were very tasty. 

I was impressed with how quick our food was delivered, BUT our bread appetizer was skipped. We had to let our waitress know it never came. I would have hoped she would have noticed first, but she didn't. 

I ordered the margarita pizza which was cooked perfectly. It was more than enough food for one person, in fact I think it could have fed two easily. My friend order the Tagliatelle pasta which was seriously one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. The noodles were cooked to perfection and that sauce, omg! This dish was also a decent size."}
{"text":"Ahhh...Food Fight, with your trendy spaces and Sysco food. 

Cento's space is beautiful and I enjoyed the music and the lighting. 

The food is bland and attention to detail is lacking. Pastas all needed seasoning and came out cold. The \"fried squid\" app was fried calamari. I tasted all four pastas at our table and was not impressed with one. 

Did I mention Cento is absurdly overpriced? $34 for pasta with a very small amount of seafood? And the seafood itself was far from fresh. Mussels were soggy/mealy, the one piece of shrimp was WAY undercooked. 

You pay for the ambiance and to rub shoulders with Madison's \"elite\" but expect to eat bland food and to put a healthy charge on your credit card.

Almost forgot to mention the hard sell on gift cards at the end of the meal. The server turned into an infomercial. Stay classy, Cento."}
{"text":"First of all, great setup to this restaurant. A lot of thought went into planning, and the flow was really great. Loved the high ceilings, exposed kitchen, and great lighting. 

Started with the butcher board (Soppressata was amazing), olives, and bacon-wrapped dates. The olives came out warm, and were definitely worth getting again. Loved the texture of the bacon wrapped dates, but something was missing from the flavor that I just couldn't put my finger on. 

Tons of great pasta options, all very reasonably priced. Easy to tell that the pasta is made from scratch as well. For how upscale this place looks, you can definitely get out of here with a bill that won't give you a heart attack! 

Definitely worth coming back to for late night happy hour, as they have 6-8 cocktails that are only $4 each, and made very well. Cento, a return trip is definitely in order!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food....They messed up my pizza order but went above and beyond brought out a different pizza for appetizer and a beer on the house! Great restaurant and great service but the best thing is the food fresh ingredients and good Italian great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Worst ROI in town. For these prices I should want for nothing. So, so, so slow. And air headed waiter. Host swings by after we order wine from airhead waiter to see if w need help ordering wine. Yah - 45 seconds ago. Food was bland. Did I mention the waiter moved at the pace of tectonic plates? Delivered my wine after we were nearly done with our entrees? Never. Going. Back."}
{"text":"Another wonderful meal. This was our second time, I was curious to see if our first incredible meal could be topped. Yes, yes it could. Mussels, Bacon Wrapped Dates, and Bolognese. The perfect order. For real though, the Bolognese was top three pasta dishes I have had in my life. It was incredible. Service=Fantastic, Atmosphere=Fantastic, Food=Delicious. Although we spent a pretty penny and got drinks, dessert, apps, and entrees, I am still happy to see a place of this quality and class offering pasta dishes in the $13-$15 price range. You certainly don't need to break the bank to eat here if you didn't want to. We were just feeling splurgy:)"}
{"text":"Cento blew me away when I came here for my first dinner, and I knew I wanted to share my experience with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. I made a wonderful decision because not only did we have a wonderful time, but we had even more delicious food.

Absolutely amazing prince Edward island mussels for our appetizer; I've been back again since valentines day, and I've ordered them again. Consistent, very (but not excessively) garlic flavored broth that pairs perfectly with the mussels. For my entree, I had the casserecce with braised lamb (no dairy), and my boyfriend had the carbonara. My plate was just lamb perfection; the noodles were delicious with a deep and rich lamb note with every bite. If I can eat this every day, I would. For the pastas, cento offers two sizes. My boyfriend finished the larger size, no problem. I also ordered the larger size, but it was too much food so I packaged the rest. So perhaps consider the smaller if you ate an appetizer or if you're not too hungry.

Service is always incredible. Servers are always willing to confirm ingredients in the dishes, and they check on the table so consistently and pretty often. They remember faces and always make you feel welcome, which is something I really appreciate from any restaurant. 

Dining room is beautiful, drinks are always amazing (if you'd like a suggestion, try the vermouth!), and suggestions and knowledge of wine is incomparable. Cento is my go to for a fun and sophisticated night out. The three times I've been here have consistently been such a pleasure to experience. I always look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Very UNDERRATED brunch spot in Madison! 

I would like to preface this by saying I give them 5 stars for brunch. I have also been for dinner and I would give that 4 stars (if you are looking for a 5 start Italian dinner in Madison, you should go to Osteria Papavero)

We had a group of 6 on a Sunday morning and we tried to get in to el dorado, chez nanou, mickeys, etc and no one had room for us.

We decided to try Cento and they had lots of open tables, didn't even have to wait. 

The food was amazing, we took forever to place our order because no one could decide what they wanted because so many things looked so good.
Great variety, whether you're in the mood for pasta, pizza, or classic brunch dishes, the menu will have something for you.

Between my friends and I we had two different pasta dishes, chorizo hash, pulled pork eggs benedict, an egg bake, and a frittata and everyone really liked what they got. 

Service was also good and the inside is very tastefully decorated."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped dates very good, northern ragu very good, pumpkin pasta, excellent wine pairings and the house limoncello was also awesome!"}
{"text":"I have a feeling Cento is going to be a big hit very quickly. Food is high-quality, really tasty (esp. the arugula mix on the side of the lemon-y chicken entree - can't remember the name, but MAN), and well-prepared.

The chicken I had might've benefited from a little something extra; it was very good, but it tasted like just a small step up from something I could've made at home. The arancini (fried risotto balls) were similar - tasted great and were well-done, but didn't quite have that \"Oh my GOD\" factor for me.

Otherwise, service was great, prices are right in line with the quality and setting, and the restaurant itself is just gorgeous. I'll go back to try more food, but to be honest, I'd go just for the dining room!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Cento! My boyfriend and I went here a few weeks ago on a Friday night. We walked in and were lucky to find a high top available in their bar area because otherwise it was pretty busy. Our waitress was really friendly and helpful. 

We started with the burrata and it did not disappoint. The tomatoes were meaty and ripe, the arugula spicy, and the burrata creamy. YUM. I got the salmon special, and it was fresh, flavorful, and interesting - just how I like my food to be! My boyfriend got the tagliatelle (pasta bolognese), and it was awesome. I took more than a few bites. Really great flavors, hearty but not overly heavy, and the perfect amount. 

A great Madison spot overall!"}
{"text":"Great little find during an evening walk.  We sat at the bar and had a great experience from the beginning.  The staff was friendly, and attentive, on top of having great food.  It was an easy walk from our hotel, and will likely be a mainstay when we visit again."}
{"text":"Loved breakfast here!  Stopped in before catching a game at the Kohl Center and had a great experience.  They have a really nice brunch deal that includes your meal, 2 breakfast cocktails, unlimited coffee, and a croissant for a flat price.  They had a nice mix of breakfast options, salads, pizza and a few other things on their brunch menu.  There are definitely options for every kind of eater.  The cocktails were delicious and a good mix of the classics and more unique recipes.  I dined here with a couple people that I did not know prior and they were incredibly demanding of the server, who took it all in stride - impressive!"}
{"text":"It's a Friday night. Make sure you have reservations. We, party of 3, didn't get a regular table. Tables near the bar are first come first serve. We luckily got a table quickly! 

Happy Hour is from 4-6pm and we made it just in time. Ordered bruschetta from the happy hour menu. We ordered the bruschetta at 5:53pm and it doesn't show up until 6:35pm. Oops. The kitchen lost our ticket. 

The broccolini bruschetta was delicious. The mushroom won was full of mushrooms and not enough goat cheese. Bread was fresh and thankfully it came out before our main entree. 

The actual entrees came out and were steaming. The garganelli I had was filled with tender mushrooms and broaden short rib. The sauce was just enough and the garganelli was perfectly cooked. I loved every bite. 

Desserts: tiramisu and caramel budino were great to share. Tiramisu was small but every bit was literally a piece of heaven in my mouth. The gelato that came with it was subtle and cleansed my palate. 

Our service was great despite the snafu at the beginning with the bruschetta."}
{"text":"Best meat and cheese board ever!!! Served on a tree!

All drinks on cocktail menu are under 8 dollars! What a steal! Try the Toscana sour. Has that  citrusy kick of a margarita without the regrets the next day from tequila. (Bourbon used in drink) 

Full menu is served at the bar! I can almost always snag a seat here when tables are full!

Also pasta dishes come in small and larger sizes. In case you are wondering small dishes are plenty enough for one person!

Lots of exclamations in this review I know! I just really like this place!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to Cento for our first anniversary. Based on the experience we had we will most certainly be returning!

Everything about our experience was outstanding. We were seated promptly upon arrival, we were given a great table in the middle of the room (upon request in OpenTable), the food was phenomenal, and the wait staff and management were friendly and knowledgeable. Cento is a Chicago or NYC caliper restaurant in the heart of Madison."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: came here for the Clean Wisconsin epicurean happy hour so my experience is probably a bit different than the average person's happy hour trip, but holy Toledo you want to get to Cento like, now.

Everything I tried was fresh and high quality and balanced. I had some marinated beets, mini meatballs, prosciutto, burrata, and my favorite bite of the evening, their bacon-wrapped dates. I am still thinking about them a week later. The mild sweetness of the dates helped offset the saltiness of the bacon and the mouthfeel of the two was so pleasant. I ate two but wish I could have eaten 200. 

The other standout was their budino - so smooth and rich and beautifully plated. The crumbled cookies gave a nice contrasting texture to the custard and the sliced strawberries on top were a nice, fresh touch. 

I'm not the most adventurous eater, but I think I might have to put the Chef's Table on my bucket list as long as Chef Pruett is around."}
{"text":"Cento is yet another uninspiring Food Fight restaurant. It's pretentious, overpriced and the food is universally bland. We had the sausage pizza and the prosciutto pizza. Both required salt and and pepper - but you had to ask for it. No salt and pepper is provided on any of the tables. The boned half chicken had a nice texture but was similarly under seasoned and required the salt and pepper. The fish items on the menu are all farm raised. The steak tartar came on a huge wafer-esque cracker that oddly tasted fishy. The tartar itself consisted of perhaps 2 tablespoons of bland and chewy beef. The only interesting item we ordered was the beet salad. It was really very good and the reason I gave Centro two rather than one stars. The dining room is appealing, the waitress pleasant, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Ehhh. That's really the only way I can describe the food. My mother and I tried multiple dishes and shared them as if they were a tapas. The reasoning simply was the more expensive the place is the less food you'll get- we were right. If you're looking for a place to really feel like you got a good meal then I would ask you to look for another restaurant. The three dishes we got was the butternut squash risotto, garganelli, and the margarita pizza. Out of the 3 the pizza was the best. The service could have been either better or they were just rusty considering we got there when they opened."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant so much, especially their brunch and pastas. 

The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because once I ordered the carrot cake for dessert and IT DID NOT HAVE FROSTING ON IT. Cento...I love you so much, but not putting frosting on your carrot cake is BS. 

PS- Your Tagliatelle pasta was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"BF planned a secret date. Made Saturday reservations (glad we did; super packed). Service was pleasant. Drinks= Old Abe's Return and Lumaca Brutto. *Very* spirit-forward, but good! Ordered their grilled octopus, potato gnocchi and garganelli. Serving sizes are....\"appropriate\" for their prices. Tasted wonderful (previous reviews had me terrified). Definitely will return."}
{"text":"It was delicious! I had pizza at lunchtime and bacon wrapped dates. I love the modern/classy feel in the restaurant. Trendy and chic. They have fancy Italian sodas, and a great wine selection. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I can't believe I held off on trying this place until after I moved out of Downtown! As in... I used to live 3 blocks away. Shame on me, so don't make this mistake, stop what you're doing and come here ASAP. 

I made reservations ahead of time, as I was celebrating a 4 year anniversary, and wanted to make this as special as we could. They set us up in a large booth smack in the middle of the restaurant, which was surprisingly private as the large seats made for some sort of enclosure. We were treated to a glass of Mercat Brut Cava each (or complimentary dessert to share), which was a pleasant start to our dinner. 

We started with the Ahi Tuna Tartare, Bacon Wrapped Dates and the Grilled Octopus. They were beautifully presented, and was extremely flavorful. The Ahi Tuna Tartare was luxurious, and very refreshing. The portion initially seemed small, but the powerful flavors definitely rounded it out nicely. The Bacon Wrapped Dates, as all the other reviewers mentioned, is definitely worth ordering! Wonderful little bite-sized pieces of salty bacon, sweet dates and a sausage filling, served in a light tomato-based sauce. I'm usually not a fan of dates, but this wowed me! The Grilled Octopus was an explosion of flavor too - the slightly charred, tender octopus pieces with small slices of olives in a vinaigrette balanced each other out extremely well. 

We ordered the Orecchiette and the Seafood Risotto for our entrees. The Orecchiette was recommended by a friend of ours, and while it didn't look particularly spectacular on the menu compared to the other dishes, we are SO glad we got it! The creamy tomato sauce, with salty pieces of sausage, just wow. Definitely recommend the Orecchiette!!! My Risotto was very generous on the seafood, and all of the seafood pieces were cooked very well (not overcooked nor too overpowering). A+ for the Risotto as well! 

Finally, we decided on a dessert to share as well, although we were already extremely full by this point. We split the Tiramisu, which was topped with a scoop of Hazelnut ice cream. Very rich and decadent, would highly recommend this as well! If you have already finished your meal full, it is definitely a good dessert to share, since it is not too big, but Tiramisus are generally pretty rich and filling.

Overall, I would DEFINITELY recommend this place. The service was wonderful, the atmosphere is beautiful and the food is divine!"}
{"text":"Have the best dining experience with the family. The Assistant Manager and Lauren were amazing. They made us feel like royalty! Great family time thanks to Cento. The dates wrapped in bacon is a must have and of course I love their seafood risotto yummy!! My hubby enjoy their lasagna. We will be back for sure!!! I almost forgot their wine list omg..highly recommended to view all the Spain and Italian variety."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison! I've gone twice thus far and will continue to make Cento my go-to restaurant whenever my parents are in town :)
Last night, our table ordered the bacon-wrapped dates, tagliatelle, pappardelle, and the formaggi pizza, with a side of butternut squash (which is seriously one of my favorite things ever...order the squash!). Everything was delicious, but my favorite entree was the pappardelle! I also love the Italian sausage & artichoke pizza, which I got the last time we went to Cento. 
For dessert, we got the tiramisu, chocolate salumi, and the carrot cake. The carrot cake is good--kind of dry, but the flavor is there. Salumi is pretty unique; I definitely recommend it if you're a fan of bittersweet chocolate. But the tiramisu...oh man, I wish I had a lifetime supply of it. The best tiramisu I've ever had! 

***Also want to shout out our amazing waitress last night. Unfortunately I cannot remember her name, but she was amazing. My dad can be pretty annoying at restaurants as he is quick to make critiques and send dishes back; when he inquired that he thought the formaggi pizza was supposed to have actual figs on it (as opposed to fig + balsamic glaze--he misread the menu), she went to the kitchen and came back with a plate of figs for him to put on his pizza. Absolutely above and beyond. Thank you so much! So sorry we can't remember your name, as you deserve getting a major shout out :(

Definitely go to Cento if you're ever in Madison. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Recently came here for brunch on the recommendation of a couple locals to try the Boozy Brunch. Unfortunately, my partner and I were not in the best shape to enjoy the two cocktails that would have come with it, but we opted to go anyway and give the food a chance, and am I ever glad we did! 

Firstly, the restaurant itself is so bright and beautiful, with ample table seating and bar seating that has full wait service, which we appreciated on a busy Sunday afternoon. We were seated within ten minutes, even with the entire place absolutely full, at a cozy high top table near the window. I loved that even the bar seating had plenty of room to navigate.

My partner and I shared the bucatini and pappardelle, as well as the breakfast potatoes with coffee and tea. I was a little bit disappointed that they were out of the tagliatelle since that was what drew me to the menu in the first place, but wow even our second choices did not disappoint! Loved the potatoes! They were perfectly crispy on the outside, and soft and fluffy inside. The bucatini was slightly salty (in a good way), and very garlicky. The pasta is a bit hard to manage because of the texture, but it's definitely worth it! If I were to order again I would probably get a side of bread to soak up the delicious sauce, since it was more soupy than sticky. We both really loved the papperdelle, and though both were good this was definitely the favorite. The pasta was the perfect texture, and held the sauce beautifully. There was just the right amount of arugula to mix in and all the flavors complimented each other very well. 

I definitely hope to return, and hopefully this time take advantage of the boozy brunch and try the tagliatelle!"}
{"text":"Cento is my current favorite Italian spot in Madison. I have enjoyed several great meals here and haven't been disappointed with any dish! Their sourdough bread and pizzas are divine, and their Tagliatelle dish is one of my favorites. The elegant yet unpretentious decor makes it an excellent spot for a lunch date or nice dinner."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe. Food was great and made from a lot of locally sourced ingredients. Service staff could be more knowledgeable about the source of the food. I loved the meat counter in the middle of the restaurant where you could see the cured meats being prepared for charcuterie. Great spot for a date."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, service and most importantly food.  Entertaining wine list.  Top location in Madison.  Delizioso.  Warm olives...yumm.  Formaggio...wow.  Do not miss.  Reservations a must.  I went with a large family entourage, very accommodating.  Go Badgers."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here to celebrate eight years of marriage and two months of parenthood. It was a lovely meal, and I must compliment the management for not allowing any guests who were screaming at the top of their lungs for milk.

In all honesty, though, this was a really, really good meal. We left deeply satisfied,  but there were some issues.

First, the pros:
+ GORGEOUS space 
+ Probably the best service that we've had in Madison from the moment we walked in until the moment that we left. Everything was on point and the meal was perfectly paced. 

The pretty good:
+ we both had some sort of take on a Moscow Mule that was just fine and seemed appropriate for the price, but didn't knock either of our socks off. It did, however, get us drunk, which we really, really needed

Appetizers:
-/+ I had a steak tartare appetizer that came with beef tartare, tuna sauce, a sea salt cracker, and hardboiled quail eggs.  I was curious about how these components would come together. The answer is that they didn't.  The beef tartare was great on its own, the tuna sauce-- which tasted more like anchovies than anything- was good, but there was too much of it, and the cracker tasted exactly like stale matzoh. Meanwhile, there are a lot of things I would do with quail eggs before I'd hard boil them. This was actually tasty and satisfying- the beef was very good and well-seasoned-- but I can't say it was successful. It was also plated on this very bizarre piece of wood that looked like a cross-section of a tree trunk. Very strange.

+++My wife had steamed mussels in a tomato-sausage sauce with grilled bread. This was INCREDIBLE. There must have been at least two dozen mussels served in a broth with large chunks of sausage. The broth tasted like the essence of a grill-- exactly what an Italian tomato sauce should taste like. It was earthy with hints of saltiness and spice that weren't at all overbearing. The waitress appeared at just the right moment with an additional plate of bread to sop it up. It was delicious.  If everything had been up to this standard, this would be a 5++++++.

Entrees:
I had a swordfish puttanesca. My wife had a rack of lamb special. Both were very good. It's easy to overcook swordfish or to undercook lamb, and they didn't do either one.  I didn't think either was entirely successful, though.  The portion size was reasonable, but it seemed somehow smaller than the appetizers. For $42 I really thought that they could have served more than two lamb chops. We've gotten far more than that at the Tornado Room, and when you're citing the Tornado Room as your standard for value, there's a problem.

The big issue is that neither of them really came with any garnish to speak of, and they needed it. The issue here is that Cento is trying to be both an Italian restaurant and a steakhouse. They have lots of entrees that you'd expect to find at an upscale Italian place, but then they also have a handful of very high-priced steaks.  In keeping with this, they've adopted one of the more obnoxious practices of steakhouses: very expensive a la carte sides.  The problem is that this doesn't work with Italian dishes. I wanted them to pair something with my fish (broccoli rabe? orzo?), and I didn't really know which one of the a la carte vegetables would go with it, so I didn't order one. Nor did I want to spend $11 for a garnish.  In the end, I kind of felt like the plates were incomplete, and, to be honest, for the prices we were charged I felt cheated.

Desserts: 
We had a buddino and a ricotta cheesecake. The buddino was good, but not great-- nowhere close to the amazing variation at Osteria Papavero. The ricotta cheesecake was the winner. Both came with two small scoops of vanilla gelato that we liked a lot.

If I were to return-- and I can't see that happening due to the price of the meal-- I'd probably skip entrees and order a few more appetizers, a cheese plate, and a butcher board."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and absolutely perfect for a date or fun dinner out with friends.  D√©cor is beautiful and the floor-to-ceiling windows made me feel like I was dining in Manhattan rather than Madison.  Food here is consistently good; for brunch, I ordered the Eggs Benedict with a side of breakfast potatoes; the potatoes were perfectly crispy, and the waitstaff was so accommodating to all of our requests. I liked the eggs, and the side salad was fresh- however, I did think that the Hollandaise sauce was a bit too lemony-other than that, no complaints.  Cento is a bit pricey, but worth it for the quality and experience.  Definitely one of my favorite places in Madison."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a Friday night. The place is nicely decorated and the wait staff are well dressed and professional. We got there early so we bellied up to their bar for a drink. We were impressed with their bartenders, they know their stuff and make really good drinks. We were well set up for a great meal for the first time at Cento and becomes their regular customer. Then, we got our food, it was a total let down. Our food was bad. I ordered the Squid Ink Tagliatelle. The seafood was not fresh, the whole dish was bland, and the pasta was over cooked. The owner and management seems to put in a lot of thoughts in who to hired, the decor, how to run the place, and they forgot the most import thing, the food have to be good to match the vibe and their price. As someone who is new to Madison, I really wanted to like this place because Madison needs a good Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Our experience at Cento got off to a rough start but it recovered fairly well. We had reservations for Saturday brunch. When we got there, there was just one couple ahead of us and then our group of 4.  After seating the couple ahead of us, the host just walked away from the entrance and seemed to ignore us for a good bit before coming back to seat us, with barely any greating or welcome. As we were being seated, we saw the host take a slip from the register (we guessed our check in notice) and palm it to a waitress as he walked by. I saw here crumble it up and then throw it away in the service area as we walked by.  We were pointed to our table and the host just walked away.  And then we sat, and were ignored for at least 15 minutes.  We tried catching the attention of various staff but no one acknowledged us.  Just as I stood up to go back and complain to the host, a waitress finally came over and asked if we'd had any help.  She apologized for the mistake, filled our water glasses, and told me that she'd find our server.  After another 4 or 5 minutes our server finally came to see us - and she was clearly rattled.  

From there, the service was decent, but far from excellent.  We enjoyed the Boozy Brunch with the Market Quiche, Hazelnut French Toast, Tagliatelle Bolognese, and the Breakfast Pizza as our entrees.  The entrees were all very nicely presented and tasted very good. Of course the drinks were good.  

We watched the staff as we ate and noticed a clear clique of those on the inside who were friendly and working together - and our waitress was clearly not in that group.

All in all, the very good food couldn't overcome the poor experience set up by the host, making it a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice about Cento is the soft gray interior. It's modern and clean but welcoming and warm at the same time. If I was rating my dining experience on the space itself, Cento would recieve five stars. Sadly, I also have to take into account the food.

I've only been to Cento at brunch, so maybe I'm missing some of the charm that seems to entice everyone else. I ordered the onion fritatta, and I have to say, there was no flavor to it. Rubbery yet airy (is that even possible) eggs that were tough around the edges and potatoes that tasted like the burnt ends of a french fry and drenched your mouth in oil. I longed for some salt or pepper, but, as is common today, none was to be found at my table. I had a bite of some of the other dishes on the table. The ragu was nice but the pizza was plain. There are other places in Madison (Grampa's, Sal's, Brutta) that do pizza better and with flavors that really come together.

Drinks were ok. $5 for a mimosa isn't bad in Madison. There were some nice flavors on the menu as well. The Fizz is a great play on a classic punch with prosecco and aperol, and was refreshing and bitter in a good way that wakes you up in the morning. You have to try the lemoncello drink with espresso. It sounds strange but you'll be wanting it again next weekend.

Service was very good. Our server was attentive, kind, and quick to fill up a glass of water and grab a cup of coffee. The bartender was friendly and ready for conversation. All in all, service was more formal than most of the establishments in the area and was a nice change of pace for Madison. I can see why this place has made such an impact in the growing fine dining scene around the capitol.

I'll be back for dinner to see if the food can sway me. One thing to note...if you're going to have the  dates stuffed with spicy sausage (ahem...chorizo) and wrapped with bacon in a pepper sauce, do yourself a favor and trek to Avec in Chicago where the recipe originated. They're much better."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Cento twice in the past two months, and both experiences were excellent. Our first visit was just the two of us and we enjoyed appetizers, cocktails, and delicious homemade al dente pasta dishes. Our second visit was with a large group of 10+ friends after seeing a show at the Overture Center. We didn't have a reservation but they accommodated us right away in the bar area, helping us rearrange tables and chairs to make room for everyone. The service was truly excellent (especially for such a large, kinda loud group!) and our servers were kind and attentive, offering to let us share multiple dishes, pizzas, bringing extra plates, and then splitting the bill. We'll definitely be back, thank you!"}
{"text":"We went here last night with my wife's family for a holiday meal. Overall, I was really impressed. I rarely notice or care about the decor, but there was something about this place that I really liked. It was well done, but not over the top. It felt dressed up, but not stuffy. Anyway, the food was outstanding and the staff was tolerant (did I say I came with my wife's family?) My only criticism is that the food was very expensive. I understand that it is high quality and carefully prepared, but I still felt it was expensive or dare I say \"overpriced?\" We got the dates (awesome), olives (meh), calamari (also awesome but better dipped in the sauce that came with the dates). The bread was the best damn bread that $3 can buy too! I ordered the fillet which was surprisingly small with barely enough vegetables to notice and it was $50! I realize this isn't a steakhouse but for $50 one could get a ginormous bone in fillet with quality sides and a salad at Tornado. They did a really good job accommodating our special requests including green salads that weren't on the menu and a \"custom\" creation requested by my uncle that they happily provided. Why are there no green salads on the menu? The music was interesting too but it seemed to turn on and off at random times. Overall I will happily go back the next time I know someone else is paying!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try Cento to see what new dishes Chef Michael Pruitt was bringing to the table, but the excitement stopped as soon as the dishes arrived at the table. 

The review from Moody F. Was correct in stating that many are likely fooled by the decor, so if you are looking for bland, over-priced food. Cento is the spot."}
{"text":"After eating here twice, I pondered about why they named the place Cento, the Italian word for one hundred. Is it because a meal for two people is likely to run over $100? Could it be because there are about 100 things on the menu, making decisions very stressful? These points may be true, but I finally decided it's because 100% of the food I've tried from Cento is wonderfully delicious.

I've gone for brunch and dinner with a big group and EVERYTHING that everyone ordered was top notch. For example, the Porchetta and Brussels sprouts pizza trumps both Grampa's and Pizza Brutta in my opinion. The squid ink tagliatelle (conveniently offered in a full and half sized portion) is just lovely in it's tasty lobster sauce. The snapper is cooked deliciously, I only got a bite of my friend's order but it was enough to make me want to go back and get a full one for myself. 

Whether you're splitting a pizza and the fabulous butcher board (comes with honey, LOVE that!) with friends or ordering entrees with a date, I highly recommend Cento for an evening of great food. The service is also excellent and the ambiance is upscale without being stuffy. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After my experience at Merchant  last year being too cool for school I was delighted tonight by Cento.  The gnocchi is some of the best I have had outside of Italy, pillowy soft with foraged mushrooms and mustard greens.  Not to be missed.  The Beet salad may not have been exciting but was lovely and delightful.   My favorite was the Rabbit Saddle which paired perfectly with the bottle of Gaja Promis    Service was personable and efficient, always there when I needed them but never intrusive.  Overall it was a standout experience and one I would like to have again.   Next year Cento.   Next year."}
{"text":"There are two tenants of pasta cooking that make or break Italian restaurants. The first being that dente is the only way and the second, that the dish should be about the pasta and not the sauce. I can't say that Cento delivered on either and outside of the pastas, all their appetisers seem to be accompanied by the same overly acidic, lack of heart tomato sauce. Unimpressed for the price tag."}
{"text":"Great ambience, delicious food that tastes fresh and flavorful, friendly service, and larger portions. Definitely highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of celebrating our wedding anniversary on Saturday night, I was blown away by the food. Just amazing, we shared a bunch of dishes and one was better then the next. 
Service, from beginning to end it was great! Special shoot out to our server Emily. She made the night.. We will be back."}
{"text":"Pros: Great service and pretty ambience.  The home-made limoncello was stellar, and the boar pasta was delicate and delicious.  The olives were tasty, though they'd be juicier if they kept them whole instead of pitting them.  The burrata was creamy and rich and served with serrano peppers, which added a nice surprising bite, but the bread it was on got mushy quickly - maybe better to serve it separately with crostini on the side.  

Cons: The amatriciana was seriously disappointing.  There was not a single piece of guanciale to be found in the dish and it tasted like Chef Boyardee poured over overcooked pasta. The pici with \"truffle\" also should specify that it is actually just \"truffle oil.\"  The charred romaine salad was a couple of wilted romaine leaves, and no anchovies in sight.  

In sum, come here after a show at the Overture Center for the lemoncello and a late night snack, but have low expectations if you come for dinner."}
{"text":"Don't waste time in line at The Old Fashioned for brunch. One block off the square is the best Brunch in the state. On both Saturday and Sunday. Better cocktails, better wines, better beers, better food. Waaaaay better. 

Ben my bartender and Jordan the manager were outstanding. Let me sample numerous wines including the best Rose' I have ever had.

I strongly recommend the arctic char with poached eggs, hollandaise, asparagus, and potatoes. Also the Italian sausage with saut√©ed onions and bell peppers. Pure perfection.

Plus the interior is gorgeous. 

May be my favorite restaurant in all of Wisconsin. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Magnifico!
 
While the food does not consistently hit the mark, Cento's √ºber-attentive service and elegant digs make every visit feel like a special occasion.  I appreciate their philosophy of sourcing the best local ingredients and preparing them with authentic Italian methods in a modern way.  When Cento's kitchen delivers on that promise, it is truly a delightful experience.
 
Belying the spartan building exterior, the interior of the restaurant seamlessly melds components from the 1920's era building (maple floors, plaster beam ceilings, interior brick walls, and stained glass) with contemporary design elements like steel bars, plush booth seating, leather chairs and modern lighting fixtures.
 
Because of the open dining area, the high ceilings and an open kitchen, the noise level rises to a dull roar when the restaurant operates at full capacity.  However, most of the time, I was able to speak with my dining companions at normal conservational levels and the soft jazz played over the speakers added to the ambiance.
 
Because of the Cento's popularity and its proximity to the Overture Center, scoring a reservation can be tricky.  Even during Valentine's Day and football Saturdays, I was able to secure a seat in the bar area and enjoyed impeccable service both visits.  And unlike some establishment were a seat at the bar means being treated like a second class citizen by the harried bar staff, the attentive service staff at Cento made me feel like a VIP - Cento certainly belongs in the top echelon of local restaurants in this category.
 
The vast wine and cocktail options are spectacular.  During my September visit, the Cold Heaven 'Mutchmore' Pinot Noir 2011 from California was a steal at $9.50 a glass.  During my recent visit, I reveled in the orangey tour de force that was the Eliot & Ambrose cocktail.  When you factor in the supremely knowledgeable bar staff, it is a solid five star experience.

Unfortunately, the food does not consistently match the high standards of the setting and staff.  While I have experienced several fantastic dishes, I've also had a number of plates fall short of my expectation level for a restaurant at this price point.  

The fantastic:
* The Butcher Board ($15) featured two cheeses, three cured meats (coppa, prosciutto and a cured beef) and a spicy preserve (blackberry I think) that offered a variety of delicious combinations.

* The gnocchi in a red sauce with crazy water (water with garlic, onion and pepper) topped with shizo.  I adored the pillowy texture and how the chef extracted tremendous flavor from the tomatoes in the sauce.

* My wife described the tomato soup as the best she ever had and she is not prone to hyperbole.  Each spoonful provided an explosion of concentrated tomato flavor.  As someone who grew up consuming awful canned tomato soups, this experienced helped erase those bad childhood memories of salty, largely flavorless soups.
* The butterscotch budino, streaked with salted caramel and topped with espresso cream blew me away.  Covered with a light streusel topping for texture, the all the subtle flavors married perfectly.  I am pretty sure I scraped off the top layer of the bowl it was served in to make sure I did not waste a speck of this delicacy.

The lackluster:
* Both times I ordered the pizza from the wood fired oven, I came away disappointed.  During my first visit, while the pie had fantastic flavor, the center of the pizza was undercooked.  The excess moisture from the cherry tomatoes prevented the center of the crust from properly baking, leaving a doughy texture.  When I mentioned this to our bartender, they immediately offered to redo the pizza and ultimately took it off our bill.  The second pizza had the opposite problem - the crust ended up burnt on the bottom, imparting a strong bitter taste.
* The bucatini carbonara had far too much tarragon and the unwieldy bucatini noodles made it difficult to consume.
* The flavor of the one-note caramel budino did not pop like its butterscotch cousin and the kitchen was stingy with the streusel topping, leaving the offering lacking for texture.  

For those of you that plan corporate events, please consider the private dining room at Cento as a future venue.  Like the cuisine that balances modern interpretations with traditional Italian preparation methods, the dining room harmonizes old and new as well as casual and sophisticated elements.  Details like original wood floors and exposed brick walls provide a timeless feel to a restaurant that opened up just months ago.  You will be a hero for your office mates, trust me on this one.

Cento is a fantastic landing spot for that special occasion meal, an expense report dinner or a casual night out.  Despite the occasional off dish, I appreciate the variety of options at different price points.  I am 100% sure that I will be returning."}
{"text":"I have almost nothing truly bad to say about Cento. I loved the atmosphere and classy design, and the service was just fine if not great. 

My boyfriend and I had their bacon wrapped dates and tuna tartare for starters, both of which were very flavorful. Then we each had pasta, I had one with lamb and he with trumpet mushrooms. We split cherry chocolate torte for dessert. 

I think my only smidgen of criticism was that the food, while still fine, was nothing very original or unique compared to other Italian-fusion restaurants. I think my lamb pasta was maybe not the best choice for a summertime meal, which I realize now, but it didn't really stand out. I couldn't taste much besides lamb and tomatoes, and there claimed to be mint (which I thought would lighten the flavor of such a rich meat). 

Like I said, I still enjoyed the food and atmosphere and service, but the five stars I would give are four because I was hoping for something more unique. All of these other reviews rave about the food, but I have had similar plates elsewhere (maybe a bit cheaper, too)."}
{"text":"This place has a really great vibe, it is beautiful. The company I work for held a banquet in a private room. The service was friendly & prompt. The drinks were spot on. Food was served family style, large portions, made with love. They had G/F options that they whipped up for anyone who requested it. We all left feeling satisfied, highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a Food Fight disappointment! Typically the restaurant company delivers.  Not with Cento. The food is mediocre at best, but the service is worse. Although our waitress was very nice, we did not receive our bottle of wine until halfway through our THIRD appetizer. Yes third because for some reason, unlike any Italian restaurant I have been visited, they charge for bread! We ended with the scallops (actually quite amazing!) and a truffle mushroom pasta. Very soupy and lacking flavor. With all the good restaurants in Madison, I don't see a need to return."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a number of times and have loved it every time. Our first time was for the chefs table. It was AMAZING! The Chef was great and the food was some of the best I've had in Madison. The wine pairings were spot on. 
We were skeptics of the whole brunch craze but figured we'd give it a try at Cento since we loved dinner there. The brunch was great and the drinks were so delicious. It's a great price and the food was exactly what we were looking for. We are now have tried other places for brunch since and Cento is definitely #1 in our books."}
{"text":"We had brunch here. The honey sweetened granola dish was to die for! Two egg dishes were wonderfully flavored & presented. The service was excellent. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Great service.  I was with a large group and they handled it nicely.  I would return with a group again."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally get the opportunity to eat at Cento. The service was not even on par with a chain restaurant. For a restaurant that wants to be higher end, the service was horrible. Our appetizers came before our drinks and while we had our menus and waiting to order dinner. We had to juggle the menus and try to enjoy the appetizers. Our drinks finally arrived halfway through the appetizers. The halibut was good. The three other entrees we ordered were terrible....flat and boring. One of the desserts was very un-appetizing. So disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! A great Food Fight restaurant with yummy pastas, good drinks, and good appetizers!

I've had the sausage pizza, a few different pastas, a late night burger, fried artichokes, bacon dates and loved it all!

Order the happy hour drink with lemon sorbet!!"}
{"text":"I had been to the bar for drinks and apps before but this time around I reserved a table for a large group of people (14).  I have to say they not only had great service for all of us but they were patient when we threw them for a loop with a gift card being equally applied to all bills (& still allowing people to pay separately or as a couple).  
All evening we had good service for our drinks and for our meal (although there was a delay, not surprisingly, for such a big group on serving the meal).  I will say that it was hard to hear as the space filled up that Saturday evening so don't go expecting an intimate experience.  However, we all enjoyed our very filling, delicious meals with rich, satisfying flavors and our unique mixed drinks (for those who didn't have beer).  It was a very belated holiday gathering so we also did a quick white elephant gift exchange and it all went of without a hitch.  I was pleased with our group experience and it will be on the top of my list for group gatherings!"}
{"text":"Nice surroundings, very good food, reasonable prices and a creative menu with some down home southern Italian  touches make for a pleasant dining experience.  Servers are somewhat inexperienced and awkward but overall the food, cost and ambiance win the day. Fine dining experiences are hard to come by in Madison but Cento comes close to being one and is definitely worth a night out when you are in town and looking to bypass the craziness of State Street!"}
{"text":"Chef Giovanni Novella and his team are absolutely killin' it. Cento deserves all the rave reviews and press because the food and staff are among the city's best to offer. Also, if you dine here, try to leave the Nikes and cargo shorts at home--it's a small sign of respect for the hard-working folks at Cento.

{"text":"Appetizer: warm olives with garlic. Need I say more? Sass Pinot from Willamette was a great pairing with the speciality pizza of pear, balsamic, pistachio and goat cheese. 

Service - friendly, knowledgeable about the menu. Food was a little slow to come out. Attentive and not overbearing. 

Ambience - excellent. Hopping and lively but not so loud you couldn't have a conversation. Seating by a window on a one way semi-busy street with a modern building across made me think for a moment I was in San Francisco. Surprising but true!"}
{"text":"Great service!  Neat nighttime atmosphere.  I was a little disappointed the menu did not have more traditional Italian American choices.  And it felt a little overpriced to me for the lack of selection."}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday and have been meaning to get to this review. I ordered the pasta with squid in it while my girlfriend has the truffle pasta I believe. I think maybe we ordered the wrong thing since people leave great reviews and some photos look so yummy. Unfortunately, maybe it's because it was busy but our food tasted pretty average and not that of a four star restaurant. Our waitress was extremely kind and warming. The head hostess, though, seemed to have a rather unfriendly attitude. I could tell it was a somewhat average night but the way she was sitting people made us feel as a nuisance. This alone slightly makes me not want to go back. Overall, average food, great service from waitress and not so great service from the hostess. Maybe we'll give it another shot some day."}
{"text":"Excellent all the way around. Ambiance is fabulous. The Hawk and Dove and Mama Mia cocktails were our choices. We all got the Taglietele Bolangnese which is beef pork and sausage, fresh pasta and very delicious. The begginig of the popular state st intersects if you need to kill time before your table is ready.  The Bar is pretty sweet to though. Only one not so friendly bartender but otherwise service was great."}
{"text":"This was a great spot for a date night.

My wife and I went on a Monday night and had no trouble being seated at 6:30. Our table was at a window overlooking the Overture Center; a beautiful view, but a reminder why this place is hard to get into on show nights.

The food was very good:
- We started by sharing the Roasted Brussels Sprout salad, which was rich and delicious (a theme throughout the meal).
- Next, we shared a \"first course\" (pasta): a bucatini pasta with mushrooms, truffle oil and pecorino. It was also delightful, though a bit buttery.
- Then, we shared the Porcini-Crusted Beef Tenderloin, also very good. The barolo sauce (a red wine reduction of some kind) was the highlight. The steak was good, not great.
- Finally, we talked ourselves into the Caramel Budino for dessert, a custard-y treat with vanilla whip cream, caramel drizzle, and cookie crumbles. This was probably the highlight, though I could have done with a bigger portion... :)

The ambiance is excellent; it can easily be either intimate and romantic or professional. Both my wife and I felt very relaxed and commented that we were easily able to enjoy a slow meal.

Speaking of slow, the service was perfectly paced. We were able to enjoy each course before being rushed into the next, which allowed the food to be savored and settle before the next onslaught of richness.

This is definitely a place to which I'll want to return. Now if there weren't so many other restaurants in Madison I want to try..."}
{"text":"Main takeaway: not worth the price.

Loved the decor, service was pretty good, wine was recommended by server and was a good choice.

We started with the butcher board which was delicious, but nothing we could't have assembled ourselves. I generally like things to be a bit \"out there\" when it comes to charcuterie, but we could have found the components from the grocery store. 

Companion had Alaskan Char which was well prepared and beautiful. I had Garganelli pasta which was underwhelming but pretty good. I suppose I shouldn't have gotten pasta if I wanted something extraordinary, but it seemed to be their speciality.

It's more of a traditional upscale restaurant, and in comparison to more experimental places in a similar price range, I was unimpressed. If you're looking for a place to take your grandparents and they are footing the bill, it's a good choice. If you're a 20-something looking to impress a date, keep looking."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a fancy dinner before the theater! Nice list of wine with a knowledgeable staff, great Italian food, and a wonderful setting."}
{"text":"Cento has a very nice atmosphere with leather seats and good lighting. I stopped in for lunch. For a cocktail I tried the Eliot & Ambrose which is Carpano Antica, wood-grilled Orange syrup, house orange-cardamom bitters and club soda over ice. It was excellent. I ordered the frittata with prosciutto and potatoes. The frittata was a disaster. It was burnt on both sides and hiding under a few pieces of prosciutto. It seemed like the cook whipped up a few eggs with minced onion and threw it in the frying pan too long browning the eggs on one side. I am guessing they then put in in the oven under a broiler where the eggs were burned on top. Why the cook sent in out like that puzzles me. I almost left. Since my cocktail was good I decided to stay and try the meat ragu with penne. It was very good and was a generous portion. The fresh parsley and carrots made it special. The house ciabatta bread was excellent. Service was above average."}
{"text":"Two words. Boozy Brunch.
Delicious, affordable and boozy. 

You get a bottomless cup of coffee/tea, a pastry, an entree and your choice of two brunch cocktails. 
*The coffee - just classic coffee. They come and ask if you'd like to refill it often. 
*The pastry - this is pretty good (I'm not sure if it actually rotates, I've gotten the croissant every time) but what makes it delicious is the jam that comes with it. I think it's blueberry, but it's nice and tart and pairs perfectly with the sweeter croissant. 
*For the entree this time I chose the Bagel & Lox. This is a massive amount of food and I can only eat one half. It's really good - the salmon is fresh and there are various flavors that add to it from the capers and pickled onion. It also comes with fresh greens (I was jealous of the BF who got potatoes with his dish, but oh well - the side effects of trying to be \"healthy\"). 
*For the brunch cocktails, I got the Mimosa and a Spicy Bloody Mary. Mimosa is decently sized and the Spicy Bloody Mary was really good. Only thing is if you don't eat meat, I'd be sure to ask to have the toppings without meat for your Bloody Mary. It came with salami. 

Besides the great food and drinks, the service is also good. They are attentive and very friendly! I'll back back again (and again and again!)"}
{"text":"I was very interested in checking out Cento before my show at the Overture Center.  The place is stunningly beautiful.  But the exposed walls lead the noise volume to be really high.  It was hard to relax at our table.

My guests and I took part in the theatre menu.  The Beet Salad was lovely, not much to it but beautifully created.  My friends had the tomato bisque, which they really enjoyed.  Me and one friend had the Char and it was very good.  The roast veggies were seasoned well.  It was a little greasy.  The other friends had the seafood pasta.  I should have gone that  route.  The sauce was delicious.

Dessert was a waste for me.  I had the lemon sorbet.  One scoop is really enough and I got three.  It was very tasty but I was puckering so bad after the first one I had to stop.  The other desserts were enjoyed by the others but I would not have liked them.  Please think about adding a cake.

The noise in the place was so loud, I had to lean in to hear my friends.  For the price, I want to enjoy my time in the place.  I may go back on a quieter night."}
{"text":"Delicious food, upbeat waitstaff, beautiful space. You really can't go wrong. Unexpectedly loved the olive oil almond cake dessert."}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived for a much needed date during Happy Hour on a freezing cold January night!  We asked for a table but were told the only option was the bar area until 6 pm, which was just fine with us.  Strangely, no one was sitting at the tables still when we left at around 5:45 pm so I'm not sure what the confusion was.  We enjoyed some drinks from the Happy Hour menu and then ordered dinner at the bar.  The brick chicken dish was the most delicious chicken I've had in a long time.  It was flavorful and tender.  There was grilled lemon and an unusual amount of arugula salad to go with.  I loved this dish but think it could use a bit less arugula and something else to go with it, something a bit more substantial maybe?  My husband had the lasagna and it was heavenly....very filling but also light.   For dessert, we tried the carrot cake but that was probably the most disappointing part of the meal.  The cake itself was good but wasn't warm and was probably made on a previous day and kept in the fridge.  It was ice cold and had a small scoop of salted caramel ice cream next to it, which was the best part.  Cold cake on a cold night never really hits the spot but we still enjoyed our time at Cento!  Would love to come back and try their pizza/pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Stopped a bar to top off with a dessert. The space is classy and happening. Bartender recommended the budino. It did not disappoint. The caramel topping was so heavenly thick it held its shape on top of the pudding. The accompanying florentine cookie was sweet, lacy, chewy with just a hint of citrus--the perfect complement to the budino.  At times the vanilla pudding tasted as though had picked up spicy taste , as though had been stored with other foods. Not enough to diminish the experience. Bathroom faucets spray water all over--surprising for an otherwise superb experience. I'd go back, and maybe for full meal."}
{"text":"Beautiful renovation of the 100 block of State St, gracious staff, elegant food, and SPACE!

The 100 block of Madison (\"Cento\", get it?) has undergone a major renovation, and Cento is a really nice endcap to the renovation.  They completely gutted the interior and installed a gray/dark wood theme, with part of the kitchen and woodburning stove exposed. Notably, there is a good deal of room between tables. In Madison, communal dining has gained popularity, but sometimes one wants to have an intimate conversation with just your table, and enough space to do so seems to be a real rarity these days.

Digestif/aperitif on tap (a type of vermouth) was an excellent aperitif.

At the bar, we enjoyed a wine soaked beet salad, which was mostly beet, which IMHO, is the way to do it.  Pistachio crusted goat cheese accompanied the salad.  Pasta dishes are offered in two serving sizes, both pasta dishes were appropriately al dente.  I'm happy that the menu has rabbit as an option; the rabbit polpettini (meatballs) are rich but not overly heavy.

A cheese and charcuterie board is available, but the staff was able to accomodate our request for a cheese-only plate with bread, olives, almonds, honey, burrata, bleu cheese, and another type of aged hard cheese.  Excellent.

Service was excellent, thanks to the two bartenders and the head server.

Madison has truly lacked a variety of good Italian restaurants, and I'm happy that Cento has made good use of a beautiful space and look forward to trying more!"}
{"text":"Had anniversary dinner at Cento last night. Ashley (sp?) was our wait person and was very good. Attentive but not overbearing. Good! We were seated back by the kitchen which made things more interesting in a good way as there was organized bustle and food prep going on. I made reservation on Open Table and requested small vase of flowers on table for anniversary  and there were there as ordered and very nice. Was not charged for them either so not sure if that is a nice policy or a mistake. Either way...very nice and great attention to details from the reservation platform to the restaurant. Host also greeted us and said happy anniversary when we arrived. Again, nice. 

On to the food. We started with the sourdough bread with butter and olive oil on the side - great! then we also had the Burrata which was simple but very good with fresh mozzarella that was easy to lay on the tomatoes. The Bacon wrapped dates were the only disappointment and normally I would have sent them back, burnt bacon and red sauce that was blah. This dish was off the mark for sure and nothing like the picture on the Cento web site.  For main courses we had the Italian sausage & artichoke pizza and the Tuscan Seafood Stew. Both very good and had about half of each left over to take home. 

Cenoto's also recognized our anniversary with a complimentary dessert so we had the carrot cake with salted caramel gelato. VERY good! On the whole, very good overall and if the bacon wrapped dates were on the spot this would have been a 5 star! Other reviews that mention it being noisy could be accurate. We were there when the restaurant was about half full and hard to hear the person across from you or the wait staff. If full, I would imagine the noise level gets worse. We were seated in the main dining area. The upper level seemed to be less noisy with carpeted floor, etc. Definitely worth a try and we appreciated Cento's attention to detail on a special night for us."}
{"text":"Nice lively place, good energy. To bad the food wasn't as enjoyable.  We were told the bar is backed up and then we were told the kitchen is backed up, hence the delays in getting our cocktails and food. When finally getting out food it was 'okay' almost bland.  The chicken Parmesan was dry and tough and the lasagna was just okay, no real zest or taste to it."}
{"text":"My partner made the reservation for our anniversary. First we ordered some appetizers, bread and bacon wrapped dates. The serving was way too fast because we did not even finish our appetizers when they served us the dinner. We both got a pasta dish, I ordered Pappardelle and my partner got the Orecchiette. Both of them were outstanding!!! 

My partner and I talked through out the whole night, but the our waitress kept checking on us every 5 minuted. As soon as I took a break from eating the dish she asked if she can box up the pasta for me. That point we have been in the restaurant for only 20 minutes... My partner was not even done and she already asked us about dessert options. 

Although it was our anniversary, the rushed waitress kind of ruined our romantic night. The dinner only took us 45min because we got tired of being rushed!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and was very disappointed. The service was absolutely terrible. Took us 30 minutes to get the bottle of wine we ordered. Continually had to remind the server about request we had. Simple ones like filling up our water and bringing pepper to the table. 

We ordered the Grilled Octopus & Bacon Wrapped Dates for appetizers. The octopus was mediocre and not very tender. The dates also lacked flavor and were underwhelming. For entree's, we shared the Scallops and the Bucatini pasta. The scallops were fantastic! I would highly recommend. The pasta was good and the sauce was flavorful. 

Overall, the food was mediocre and the service was terrible. I don't anticipate coming back again."}
{"text":"The food at Cento was absolutely delicious, and a great value for the price! I had the olives to start (very warm and flavorful) followed by the seafood stew. Super, super generous seafood portion, with a huge piece of bread on top. The waitstaff seemed busy but was very friendly and helpful. I wish I had had room for dessert. The restaurant is very dark but isn't too loud, and I love how you can see the kitchen and pizzas being tossed. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on the graduation weekend before heading to overture center for The Lion King. The food were amazing, super tasty and just perfect. We ordered cod and steak for our main course and we had nothing to complain! We ordered budino for dessert it is certainly a must try here!!! You won't regret it! Service is also super! The waitress we had was very good at timing knowing that we had a show to catch! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Incredible and creative food! Friendly atmosphere and knowledgeable staff! I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a new gem in Madison and will definitely be added to my regular circuit. Be warned: they take both the food and the atmosphere very seriously (in a good way).

We happened to stop by for opening night this evening and were really impressed with the space and the service. The restaurant is in one of the old buildings on the 100 block of state street and they kept a lot of the original features when they built the current business (the stained glass windows, plaster trusses, and hardwood floors are original features).

One thing I was really impressed by was the waiter's knowledge of the menu and pronunciation of Italian dishes. He really helped us order the right items based on what we were hungry for.

I got the mushroom gnocchi, which was out of this world. We also got the arancini as an appetizer and I got to try some of my friend's margherita pizza. The food is the real highlight of this place, as everything was delicious.

The prices were high-end for Madison; our bill came out to about $45 per person with a round of drinks, an appetizer, and entrees.

I felt a little under dressed as most of the staff were wearing fancier clothes and the managers were donned in suits. I would say the dress code is dressy casual.

Caitlin, resident sommelier of Fresco, stopped by to answer some of our questions about the building and tell us about their opening. She was quite knowledgeable and very friendly, offering her opinion of our dinner options.

I absolutely loved the place and will be taking friends and family back presto."}
{"text":"Great & wonderful old fashioned, I'm looking to return just for the drinks. The food is great also, looking to return to try another dish."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison. The food, drinks, service and ambiance have always proven to be top notch! I have been for dinner, brunch and a few times just for apps and drinks. Everything I've tasted from pizza to pasta to salads and charcuterie were perfect. For brunch, I usually stick with my favorite - the lox plate and their rendition is SO good! Also, the boozy brunch special almost too good to be true... Such a great deal at such a beautiful restaurant!  Also, shout out to Jason. Great waiter!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! My boyfriend and I came in for brunch on Sunday 11/5/17. We made a reservation for 1:00 and I had requested a booth. We sat in a huge U shaped booth! So cool. 

Our server, Alsa, was so nice. She went over the brunch menu since it was our first visit. We ordered coffee with cream to start. I had the smoked pork Benedict and my bf had the daily quiche. 

The Benedict was the best one I've ever had. The perfect poached eggs and hollandaise sauce were excellent!  I love the pulled pork vs the classic Canadian bacon. The small green salad was perfectly dressed with a light vinegarette. 

Ben's quiche was large portion and served with breakfast potatoes. 

We decided to try dessert and the tiramisu was worth the $9 price. So fresh and delicious with a little scoop of hazelnut ice cream. 

Loved the ambiance, the service and the food!!"}
{"text":"Between 3 and 4, really!

I can't say enough about the service. Outstanding! There was a party in the back that was apparently slowing up our food. Server went out of her way to make it right, even though we didn't complain.

Otherwise, we had a small issue with bones in fish, and unfortunately the branzino was out for the night.

Service really saved the day! We will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Cento is great foods, excellent service.

Granted, our waitress broke the cork of our wine, but the manager and sommelier both came to apologize and gave us free dessert. It was completely unnecessary. Having worked at italian restaurants myself, I completely understood what the poor girl was going through.

Still, everyone was extremely friendly, even with midwestern standards. Recommendations were spot on, the sommelier commented on the wines we had, and the manager came out to comment on our dishes.

The food was equally excellent. We had the beef tartare and calamari as appatizers, which were great (the calamari was a bit on the heavy side). The beef tartare was very fresh. 

We also had the pizza margherita - it was cooked in their stone oven which made the crust super crispy and the tomato sauce was excellent. AFterwards we had the black tagliatalle seafood pasta with sea urchin sauce. I've had worse seafood pasta's in Japan's Ginza district. I was super impressed.

Finally, the lamb, dessert, and dessert wine were equally impressive. I will be recommending Cento to all of my friends. I'm a student now, so expensive restaurants aren't usually my thing, but I will definitely be coming back to Cento soon!"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner. The pasta I got (one with pork and caramelized onions) was quick, albeit suspiciously, but quite good. It was firm to the bite and the sauce was very flavorful. The drink options are many and the decor was modern and minimalistic. Got tiramisu for dessert and it was sublime. One of the best Italian place around, but not quite the best."}
{"text":"I have never had a meal here that I haven't loved. Great location for a bite before a show. The atmosphere is intimate, quiet, and has low-lighting - a perfect fine dining place for those with good taste and perhaps a migraine. Now if the prices were any higher, I would probably lower my rating and expect more from their food, but I think the quality to price is spot on (that's something I always value in my reviews). Oh, and this is one of the few restaurants where I always consider the dessert menu."}
{"text":"I love everything about Cento. 

DRINKS: The cocktails were delicious. My husband described \"the rye of the beholder\" as the best drink he's ever had. They also have a nice wine selection and are really good at helping you pick a wine.

FOOD: My husband and I started with 2 small primi plates to share. We had the ricotta-filled agnolotti and the gnocchi. Both were good, but the gnocchi was SO delicious, we both agreed that next time we would want a large order of gnocchi as an entree. The gnocchi was very light and the mushrooms had an incredible meaty taste. 

Next, we split pollo al mattone.  It's half a chicken, so there was plenty of food for the two of us to share. The chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy, and well seasoned.

For dessert, we shared cherry chocolate truffle cake topped with gelato and caramel. Yes, it is as good as it sounds.  :)

SERVICE:  I was very impressed with how knowledgeable the waitress was about everything. She could describe all the cocktails and helped us each find one that matched our taste. When we were deciding what to order, she helped us decipher some of the Italian words we were unfamiliar with and eloquently described menu items. At the end of our meal, the chef came to our table to greet us.  Meeting the chef added to our great experience."}
{"text":"Amazing, truly the best italian place in the state"}
{"text":"TL:DR - The good: food and waitstaff. The bad: Front house management and drinks. Both hallmarks of being owned by a restaurant group. Elaboration- The food is excellent and well priced. I've never had a bad meal here. The appetizers, pizzas, pastas, and salads are all very tasty. The waitstaff (once seated) is attentive and everyone has a good attitude. Even if the food is delayed they stop by to update you. However, getting seated is always an issue. We always have reservations when we come here and are made to wait 10-15 minutes every time in an effort to get us to sit at the bar. Normally this wouldn't be irritating, but word to the managers: the entire side of your restaurant is glass. Customers can SEE the empty tables waiting for patrons. We routinely wait a random amount of time only to be sat at the empty table we see walking in. Also, the drinks are woefully under-powered. If you don't mind spending 10$ on a rocks glass full of mixers and juice, feel free to indulge in their \"cocktails\". If you want customers to sit at the bar, make it worth their while. Finally, when seated, you have to shuffle through pamphlets and handouts from their owning group (Food Fight). Nothing says \"romantic night out\" more than glossy coupons."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a wonderful dinner tonight. We tried the below dishes:
Appetizer:
1.Grilled octopus  kind of special but a little too sour 
2.Bacon-wrapped dates: good  (recommend) I love this com
3. Steamed mussels kind of similar to the seafood stew but with spicy Italian sausage 
Entrees:
1.Jumbo prawns: the polenta is good 
2. Lamb Ossobuco: really yummy and juicy the saffron risotto is soft and a little milky taste (recommend)
3. Tuscan seafood stew: contains cute Squid and swordfish 
Wines:
All summer 17 
Living in a bubble (beautiful wine glass)
What happens in earth 

The environment is nice 
The services are good as well. It is better if the server could check us more frequently!"}
{"text":"This place was a delicious discovery! My extremely food savvy friend recommend it last week and I'm so glad I made reservations for last night. The decor is swanky and I loved the huge windows for evening people-watching. Order the bread (it costs extra, but is worth it!) and enjoy anything on the menu. I went with the healthier salad option and was surprised and pleased with extremely flavorful spinach salad (honey-champagne vinaigrette?! Yes please!) For the main course, my friend ordered the Orecchiette, which was wonderful (and that's coming from someone who does not like Italian sausage usually) and I was blown away by how tasty, yet light the Roasted Arctic Char was! Don't miss this! The Chocolate Salumi is a decadent blend of rich chocolate, smooth caramel, and cool vanilla gelato (which was wonderful! I know \"vanilla\" can has a bit of a plain reputation). 
Only note is that this place is loud (a ton of hard surfaces so hearing your other dining guests may be hard) and reservations on the weekend seem to be a must. Well worth the reservation! Yum!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!! Took customers here and they were all very pleased. The President of our company liked it so much that he planned to take his wife back the following weekend.

Great find in a town full of great restaurants"}
{"text":"Ate brunch at Cento today. First off, the inside of the restaurant is beautiful- it's only 4 months old and is very modern and comfortable. As large as the restaurant is, there aren't that many tables, which is nice because you don't feel like you're on top of other parties. Also the booths are large and comfy. Plus, it was easy to get a reservation for a large party, which I can't say about many brunch places in Madison. I'm guessing this is because Cento is new and doesn't have a large following yet, though I doubt that will last very long.

The service was fantastic. I wish I could remember our server's name, but she was so thoughtful and kind. She didn't mind that we asked 100 questions and made a huge ordeal out of splitting the check/using different cards/gift certificates, or that we had several diners join us at different times. At one point, she overheard me say that my drink was a little sweet and came by and offered to replace it. We loved her- I would come back just to have her as my waitress again.

Everyone absolutely loved their food. We started with the porchetta & brussels sprouts pizza, which was gone in 3 minutes flat. I had the baked eggs & polenta with vegetables and added prosciutto, so good. Others at my table had the bacon wrapped dates (amazing), eggs benedict, margherita pizza, artic char, and soft scrambled eggs with prosciutto. No one was disappointed, and we all vowed to go back for dinner after peeking at the dinner menu. They also had wonderful drinks.

Will definitely come back here and would strongly recommend to others."}
{"text":"Excited to try the latest Food Fight restaurant we rounded up seven of our closest friends and headed Downtown on a Friday evening!   We had a reservation and were seated promptly, and were surprised to see the bar was empty other than us at 6:00 pm.  We were seated in the upper dining room which was more secluded from the fun hustle and bustle of the main restaurant, but I think it was due to the size of our party.  Overall the atmosphere and interior design were beautiful!  We started with the butcher board and dates appetizers to share, which were simple yet delicious.  Our table decided to order a myriad of menu items and share with the group so we could try more things, which was fun!  We really liked that you can order a smaller portion of the pasta dishes (but the small is by no means too small).  We ordered the veal with buckwheat papardelle, and a wood fired pizza.  The pasta was great, lots of flavors, the buckwheat papardelle had a unique firmness and the presentation was beautiful.  The pizza could have been cooked more and wasn't quite up to par with Caf√© Porta Alba, but still kept to a true authentic Italian style.  The drinks were good as well (I've posted a picture of the cocktail menu since they don't show it on their website) I had the Rye of the Beholder and the Vespa Sidecar.  Overall the space is beautiful, the food is good, but next time we would like to be in the main dining room with a view into the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Came in last night for my third visit to Cento. I think this was the best visit yet. 

I went with the Tagliatelle again. I can't get enough of this stuff!! 11/10 recommend. 

The BF went with the Chicken Parm this time around. He enjoyed it and said it was very flavorful. 

Our friend who was dining with us has the seafood Risotto. It was super aromatic and looked pretty tasty. She really liked it and said she would recommend it. 

We also got the sourdough bread and fried Mozz as appetizers. The fried Mozz is a must. I will probably get this every time going forward. Bonus - the bread pairs perfectly as you can dip it in the sauce that the mozzarella comes in! Boom! 

Service was stellar as always. Table was ready on time. Friendly and attentive server. 

I can't recommend this place enough. I would say it's easily one of my favorite restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"I have no complaints. zero.  Drinks=Excellent.  Service=Excellent. Loved everything from the bricks behind the bar to the suggestions about the menu.

Did I comment already on the amazing cocktails?!?

I had the mussels, they. were. delicious.

Can't wait to go back!

{"text":"Didn't have a reservation and came in on a Friday night randomly.
I ended up ordering a pizza, which was way too big for just me to finish! My parents got a salad, some appetizers, and a pasta.
There are definitely entrees that are pretty hefty in price, but you can undoubtedly get a wonderful meal for $15. 
Wonderful service, even better atmosphere! Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I dine out often... and everywhere.  Cento was a breath of fresh air among the decidedly mundane that has become dining in Wisconsin.  After all, how many \"gourmet\" versions of a cheese curd can one consume?  But I digress...  

We arrived on a Friday night during prime hours, (we had a reservation but were quite early) and cozied up to the bar for a glass of wine.  The hostess and bartenders were both quite friendly and attentive.  Our coats were hung (greatly appreciate this) and although we had to wait for a seat at the bar we were informed that the wait would be short as a large table would be dining soon.  The wine was fresh, crisp, perfectly chilled and served in lovely delicate stemware.  The ambiance, seating, lighting, and general atmosphere is lovely.  I always appreciate an open kitchen concept to feel more connected with the food.

We ordered a variety of dishes:

Warm marinated olives (Delightful and genius to serve them at a toasty temperature, it truly brought out the different flavors of the olives.)

Seafood bisque (My date had this and loved it.  I don't eat meat so did not partake.)

Cedar roasted artic char with roasted vegetables (Absolutely mouthwatering and so flavorful.  The fish was wonderful...the roasted vegetables...perfection! I can't even accurately describe the flavoring on this.  Oddly enough it was reminiscent of a campfire and s'mores, but not. You have to trust me and TRY THIS!)

Squash, Goat Cheese and Mint with Balsamic as a side. (This was a stunning side dish.  I could have eaten a trough of this delightful dish!)

My date had:

Prosciutto wrapped branzino with spring vegetables (The fish is served whole with head and tail, yet deboned.  It was flaky, fragrant and perfectly cooked.  It was beautifully presented and well worth the wait.)

For a side he had the roasted brussel sprouts and this very generous portion was flavored with apples and cooked perfectly.

For dessert we indulged in the caramel bundino, which was a decadent multi texture dish that exploded in subtle tastes.

If you haven't been to Cento, then you are truly missing out on one of Madison's gems.  I am looking forward to many more visits to sample the rest of their extraordinary menu.  Bravo Chef Michael Pruett on a wonderful addition to Madison't culinary highlights.  I WILL be recommending you to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Took hubbs here for his birthday dinner.
I posted pics of our dishes.
I loved everything, except the beef tartare.  Hubbs loved everything.
We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The Spousal Unit and I attended the first of Chef Michael's Italian Regional dinner series. At $60/person, including wine pairings, it's a steal. This one featured food and wine from the NE-most corner of Italy and so had a German.Austrian slant to the offerings (think wurst, goulash, strudel) but definitely Italian. The wines from the L'eft Bank Wine distributor were unique to the region and excellent. Alois Lageder Pinot Grigio and Pinot Noir (no oak), Lagrein and a 'knock your socks off\" late-harvest dessert Gewurztaminer served with the best apple strudel I've ever had. 

Madison is lucky to have Chef Michael Pruett and the best way to experience great chefs is to give them free rein, sit at a big table and let them strut their stuff. I'm looking forward to the next in the series."}
