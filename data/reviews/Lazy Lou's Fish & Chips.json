{"text":"I met a new friend in my math class in school...   I've drove past this place a million times going to her place for study group... after finals... (we both aced our math test!!) we went driving around to have a celebration dinner before her kids and hubby got home.. lol   we couldn't pick a place so we just pulled in and decided to give it a go.   we walk in and its definitely a mom and pop kinda thing going on... blue and white picnic table clothes over the tables... not even close to a chain...   the only guy working there was very helpful. Because we had never been there before we had no clue what was good... he helped us in the right direction... :)   we ended up with cod.. 3 nice sized pieces.. my friend had the fries.. and i had veggies as the side... cauliflower, broccoli and carrots... (they were frozen ones warmed up.. but they still hit the spot) also coleslaw and hush puppies!! they were the best!! i had never tasted such amazing hush-puppies in my life!!!!!!!!! i want to go back and just get a huge order of hush puppies to be honest! they were that amazing!   the only guy working there had our food out to us within 10 minutes! it was awesome...   I will be back!"}

{"text":"I'm gonna miss it. Everyone asked the ol' guy there if he was Lou. Lou was long gone because my GF said she'd gone there since high school. So that was about 35 years!   Cheap eats, good enough food and the ol' guy was always real nice to her because she was hot.  Well, the GF OD'd accidentally on her rx meds right before it changed ownership and it's name. I could care f*ckin' less what it's called now. I went there only because the GF always wanted to go there when she was at my place. It's about a half block away. I see it, think of her. Everything changes, everything moves on. God I miss goin' there because it meant I was with her... and I was real happy."}
